(“ETI”) submits this reply to the briefs of the Public\n\nUtility Commission of Texas (the “Commission” or “PUCT”), Texas Industrial\n\nEnergy Consumers (“TIEC”), and the Office of Public Utility Counsel (“OPUC”).\n\n                          ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.       The CGS program is the result of legislative choices that differ\n         dramatically from traditional utility regulation.\n\n         There is an unwarranted undercurrent of blame running through the\n\nCommission’s brief. Contrary to the Attorney General’s rhetoric, ETI does not\n\nseek a “free lunch,” to “avoid the reality of competition,” or to “maintain its\n\nmonopoly” by “designing an unfair program that is sure to be rejected.” Nor is\n\nETI “insinuating” or “pretending” “nonsense.”1\n\n         ETI proposed the competitive generation service (“CGS”) program because\n\nthe legislature mandated that it propose one.           See Tex. Util. Code Ann.\n\n§ 39.452(b). Moreover, this is a new program that differs in fundamental respects\n\nfrom the way utilities have operated under traditional regulation. In crafting the\n\nCGS statute, the legislature both expressly and impliedly rendered certain\n\ntraditional ratemaking principles inapplicable or unworkable. For example:\n\n         •      Utilities subject to traditional regulation are responsible for\n                procuring power for all their customers. The CGS program\n\n\n1\n    See PUCT’s Brief at 29 & 30.\n                                           1\n\f            provides a unique opportunity for some customers to contract\n            for their own power.\n\n      •     Utility rates are traditionally set based upon historical levels of\n            expense. CGS program rates must be set in the same\n            proceeding in which the program itself is created, even though\n            there are no historical CGS expenses.\n\n      •     Under traditional regulation, utilities charge rates to customers\n            that include generation, transmission, and distribution costs.\n            ETI, however, must charge an “unbundled” transmission\n            services rate to CGS customers, who are deemed not to be\n            “wholesale transmission customers.”\n\n      •     Because bundled rates are set for the future based upon\n            historical expenses, utilities generally bear the risk that costs\n            will increase before the next rate case. In the CGS statute, the\n            legislature expressly entitled ETI to recover “costs unrecovered\n            as a result of the implementation of” the program.\n\n      •     In contrast to general ratemaking principles, the legislature in\n            the CGS statute specified that some customers may not bear the\n            burden of unrecovered costs. It protected “manufacturers” who\n            choose not to participate in the program.\n\n      •     And though PURA generally limits a regulated utility’s ability\n            to offer discount rates and then burden other customers with the\n            costs the discounted customer avoids, CGS program rates “may\n            not be considered to offer a discounted rate.”\n\nThe CGS program is not business as usual.\n\nII.   The Commission has ignored part of the legislative enactment, contrary\n      to the most basic rules of statutory construction.\n\n      Over the lengthy course of the underlying contested case, the parties were\n\nnever able to agree unanimously on several issues, including the scope of ETI’s\n\nentitlement to recover costs, the extent to which the CGS program may cause ETI\n\n                                         2\n\fnot to recover costs embedded in its bundled rates, and who may fairly be required\n\nto pay for any of those unrecovered costs.2 Though appellees continue to debate\n\nthe latter two issues, they are not bases for the agency order under review. The\n\nCommission avoided those issues by defining the term “unrecovered costs” as\n\nexcluding production-related costs embedded in ETI’s bundled rates.3\n\n       The CGS statute entitles ETI “to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of\n\nthe implementation of the tariff.” Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 39.452(b). The breadth\n\nof those words, and their failure to exclude any category of costs, cannot\n\nreasonably be disputed. Nevertheless, the Commission has declared that the statute\n\nauthorizes ETI to recover only certain costs – specifically, those “of”\n\nimplementing the program. The Commission has effectively written several words\n\nout of the statute, as illustrated below:\n\n               The utility’s rates shall be set … to recover any costs\n            unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff….\n\n      This interpretation violates the paramount rule of statutory construction that\n\nstatutes must be construed according to their plain language.                 E.g., State v.\n\nShumake, 199 S.W.3d 279, 284 (Tex. 2006). The truest manifestation of what\n\nlegislators intended is what they enacted: the literal text they voted on. Texas\n\nCoast Utils.

The legislature is presumed to have chosen its words with care, and\n\nstatutes should not be construed to render legislatively enacted words superfluous.\n\nE.g., Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue, 271 S.W.3d 238, 256\n\n(Tex. 2008). Moreover, when the meaning of a statute is plain from its text, rules\n\nof construction or other extrinsic aids cannot be used to create ambiguity. E.g.,\n\nHouston Mun. Employees Pension Sys. v. Abbott, 192 S.W.3d 862, 864 (Tex. App.\n\n– Texarkana 2006, pet. denied). The Commission may not disregard or rewrite the\n\nunambiguous mandate of the CGS statute.\n\n         A.      The Commission's order is not sustainable on an undecided\n                 factual theory.\n\n         The Attorney General and TIEC assert that the Commission instead\n\ndetermined that all of ETI’s base-rate production costs will in fact be recovered\n\nthrough the CGS program that was ultimately adopted.4 The agency said no such\n\nthing.        The Commission did not reach that question because, again, the\n\nCommission said the statute does not entitle ETI to recover that type of cost at all.\n\n         TIEC champions the factual theory anyway, presumably because it was\n\nTIEC’s principal argument to the agency. TIEC actually agreed that, “[i]f … the\n\nCommission determines that there are unrecovered costs, then Entergy is entitled\n\n\n\n\n4\n    PUCT’s Brief at 15; TIEC’s Brief at 6-10, 14, 22-23, & 35-37.\n                                                 4\n\funder the statute to recover any such costs.”5 To TIEC, the dispute should not be\n\nabout the scope of the statutory entitlement – it should be about whether ETI\n\nwould actually recover all of its costs.6\n\n       The Commission disagreed with TIEC about that. After the parties tried\n\nunsuccessfully to settle remaining issues, the Commission conducted a hearing to\n\nconsider “the remaining contested threshold issue – what types of costs will be\n\nconsidered unrecovered for purposes of PURA 39.452(b)….”7 Though the issue is\n\none of law, the parties submitted testimony on the proper interpretation of the\n\nstatute to aid the Commission in its determination.8               After the hearing, the\n\nCommission issued an interim order “making its determination of the definition of\n\nunrecovered costs.”9 The Commission said:\n\n       [T]he proper interpretation of “costs unrecovered as a result of\n       implementation of the CGS program tariff” is costs to implement and\n       administer the CGS program tariff. Such unrecovered costs do not\n       include lost revenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types\n       of costs. The Commission reverses the proposal for decision on this\n       issue.[10]\n\nIn its final order, the Commission acknowledged its interim ruling that:\n\n\n5\n   AR Part I, Binder 1, Item 22 (TIEC’s Nov. 1, 2011, List of Unsettled Issues and Request for\nProcedural Schedule at 3).\n6\n  Id. at 4 n.3.\n7\n  AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at 3 (emphasis added), 7, & FOF 20); see also AR\nPart I, Binder 1, Item 77 (Interim Order at 1 & 5).\n8\n  E.g., AR Part II, Binder 3, ETI Exh. 91 (Supp. Direct Testimony of P.

PURA § 39.452(b) does not allow for the recovery of lost\n              revenue or embedded generation costs.[13]\n\n       A review of the whole order reveals that it is TIEC, not ETI, that is\n\n“plucking” isolated words out of context.14 It is abundantly clear throughout the\n\norder that the Commission’s decision was premised not upon a factual\n\ndetermination about the extent to which ETI might not recover base-rate costs, but\n\nupon a legal conclusion about the scope of costs recoverable under the CGS\n\nstatute.15\n\n       For that reason, the order cannot be affirmed on TIEC’s factual theory. This\n\nCourt has repeatedly recognized that an agency order can be upheld on any legal\n\nbasis shown in the record, but it may not be sustained on an unarticulated factual\n\n11\n   AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 20) (emphasis added).\n12\n   Id. at 6.\n13\n   Id. at COL 2.\n14\n   See TIEC’s Brief at 36.\n15\n   AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at 6, 7-8, 11, FOFs 49-51, COL 2).\n                                               6\n\ftheory.

The Commission’s error is not harmless.\n\n         Though the Commission did not decide any factual dispute about\n\nunrecovered costs, and though the Attorney General recognizes that this case\n\npresents a legal question of statutory interpretation,16 the Attorney General now\n\nadvances a “no harm, no foul” theory. That is, the Attorney General contends that\n\nETI is not “aggrieved” by any error in the Commission’s statutory interpretation\n\nbecause ETI will in fact recover all its costs.17 The order cannot be sustained on\n\nthis basis.\n\n         The rule that only a party “aggrieved” by an agency order may challenge it\n\nis the same as the rule that only a plaintiff with a “justiciable interest” may file a\n\nlawsuit.

This Court must review the pleadings in\n\nfavor of ETI, and if necessary, the record to determine if “any” evidence supports\n\nstanding. See Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440,\n\n446 (Tex. 1993).\n\n16\n     PUCT’s Brief at 17.\n17\n     Id. at 12 & 22-29.\n                                          7\n\f         ETI undeniably pled that it is aggrieved by the agency’s order because the\n\norder deprives ETI of dollars it is entitled to recover under the CGS statute.18 No\n\none disputed that ETI made this allegation in district court.\n\n         Moreover, there is abundant evidence in the record showing that the\n\nCommission’s order deprives ETI of an opportunity to recover all of its costs. The\n\nCGS program was ultimately designed such that participating CGS customers\n\nwould bear the costs of the energy and capacity that they contract for under the\n\nCGS program. But the program does not, even as redesigned through negotiations,\n\nimpose upon participating customers all the costs they would have borne under the\n\nbundled rates that were set through the traditional ratemaking process.\n\n         Under the traditional regulatory scheme, ETI must arrange generation\n\nresources to serve all of its customers. ETI’s generation portfolio consists of many\n\ntypes of resources. Those include power plants owned and operated by ETI and its\n\naffiliates, short-term purchased capacity contracts, and long-term purchased\n\ncapacity contracts. ETI makes commitments and incurs costs to serve all its\n\ncustomers, including the LIPS class, not knowing which of them might ultimately\n\nmigrate to the CGS program, or for how long. The Commission determined in\n\n\n\n\n18\n     See CR 5.\n                                          8\n\fDocket No. 37744 and subsequent rate cases19 which of those costs ETI reasonably\n\nand necessarily incurred, and set base rates to recover those costs.20\n\n       When a LIPS customer migrates to the CGS program, the customer will\n\nreceive a credit for the embedded production costs the customer would have paid\n\nunder ETI’s base rates.21 The credit is some $6.50/kW/month.22 But ETI is still at\n\nrisk of having to pay these costs.\n\n       Several ETI witnesses explained that the Entergy system must continue to\n\nplan for and acquire short-, limited-, and long-term resources to reliably serve all\n\nits Texas customers, including LIPS customers who may or may not choose to\n\nparticipate in the CGS program.23 These witnesses acknowledged that the CGS\n\nprogram may help ETI avoid acquiring some capacity in the future.24 However,\n\nthe program has a limited ability to relieve ETI of its planning obligations because\n\n\n19\n    The Commission has reset ETI’s bundled rates twice since the Commission adjudicated\nDocket No. 37744.

The limited term nature of the proposed\n       agreements, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the future\n       continuation of the program, do not provide sufficient assurance that\n       CGS resources will be available to meet ETI’s long-term resource\n       needs. Furthermore, the program does not relieve ETI of its\n       obligation to serve CGS customers in the event that providers\n       withdraw or fail to renew under the program. Ultimately, the CGS\n       program is at best a limited-term alternative that could defer or\n       displace short- and limited-term PPAs [purchased power agreements],\n       but it in no way can be considered a long-term resource option or\n       affect ETI’s long-term acquisition strategy.[26]\n\nMoreover, the CGS program in no way avoids embedded capacity costs that the\n\nCompany has already incurred, especially for existing power plants and long-term\n\npurchased capacity contracts.27 Nor does the program enable ETI to recover a\n\nreturn on investments it has already made to serve customers.28\n\n       This evidence was presented after the parties proposed that CGS suppliers\n\nwould provide service that Entergy could treat as “firm” capacity.29 The Attorney\n\nGeneral ignores it.

ETI simply sought to ensure that it would\n\nnot be in a worse position as a result of the program.35 That is, after all, what the\n\nlegislature mandated when it said CGS rates must be set to allow ETI to recover\n\n“any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the [CGS] tariff.” The\n\nCommission’s erroneous interpretation of this mandate is not harmless – it\n\ndeprives ETI of any opportunity to recover costs that will effectively be “stranded”\n\nas a result of the CGS program.\n\n          The Attorney General essentially invites this Court to find, based on\n\nconflicting evidence, that ETI is not harmed by the Commission’s decision. But\n\nthis Court cannot make original findings of fact. E.g., Texas Nat’l Bank v. Karnes,\n\n717 S.W.2d 901, 903 (Tex. 1986). Moreover, at this juncture, resolving this case\n\nbased on conflicting evidence would deprive ETI of its substantive right to\n\nfindings on fact issues upon which the agency decision rests. See Tex. Gov’t Code\n\nAnn. § 2001.141. If the Commission indeed disposed of the case on TIEC’s\n\nfactual theory, the Commission was required to say so, and harmed ETI by failing\n\nto do that.\n\n\n\n\n35\n     AR Part II, Binder 3, ETI Exh. 92 (Supp. Rebuttal Testimony of P. May at 28 of 30).\n                                                 12\n\f      C.     The 2011 CenterPoint case does not support                    the\n             Commission’s interpretation of the CGS statute.\n\n             1.    The statute at issue in CenterPoint authorized\n                   recovery of very specific costs; the CGS statute\n                   is not so limited.\n\n      The Commission based its interpretation of the CGS statute on this Court’s\n\ndecision in CenterPoint Energy Houston Elec., LLC v. Public Util. Comm'n of\n\nTex., 354 S.W.3d 899 (Tex. App. – Austin 2011, no pet.). As ETI explained in its\n\ninitial brief, that opinion does not concern the CGS statute. It concerns the Energy\n\nEfficiency Cost Recovery Factor (“EECRF”) statute, which by its very terms,\n\nauthorizes a utility to recover only costs made for the specific purpose of satisfying\n\nthe goal of an energy efficiency program.           See Tex. Util. Code Ann. §\n\n39.905(b)(1). The EECRF statute does not authorize the recovery of other costs,\n\nlike those that “result from” the implementation of an energy efficiency program.\n\nId. That is why this Court held that the EECRF statute does not authorize a utility\n\nto recover lost revenues that were intended to pay for something other than the\n\nutility’s costs of implementing an energy efficiency program. CenterPoint Energy\n\nHouston Elec., LLC, 354 S.W.3d at 904. Though the Court made observations\n\nabout other PURA provisions as well, it did not mention the CGS statute.\n\nMoreover, none of those observations were essential to the Court’s interpretation\n\nof the EECRF statute. Because the statute at issue in the 2011 CenterPoint case\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fand the one at issue here are materially different, appellees’ reliance upon the case\n\nis misplaced.\n\n                 2.     Here, ETI seeks to recover the very type of costs\n                        the CGS statute authorizes it to recover.\n\n         In an attempt to make this case sound like CenterPoint, or perhaps because\n\nthey recognize that the legislature clearly intended ETI to recover all the costs that\n\nwill otherwise be unrecovered as a result of implementing the program, appellees\n\nfocus their efforts on arguing that ETI is seeking something other than “costs.”\n\nThey argue that because the word “revenue” appears in the proposed CGSUSC\n\nrider, ETI is seeking to get (and presumably keep) money that it will not have to\n\npay out for any expense. That is not true. ETI has throughout this case sought to\n\nrecover the money the Commission authorized it to recover via test-year\n\nratemaking, because that was the amount of money the Commission determined is\n\nnecessary to pay ETI’s costs, and because the legislature entitled ETI to recover\n\nthat money in the CGS statute.\n\n         Appellees’ repeated suggestion that there is some significance to the way\n\nETI has characterized these amounts is without merit. It is true that ETI has\n\ncharacterized this money as both “revenues” and “costs” in this case. But that is\n\nnot to “escape” this Court’s ruling in CenterPoint.36 ETI simply recognizes the\n\nfundamental ratemaking principle that base rate costs are a utility’s revenue\n\n36\n     See PUCT’s Brief at 21.\n                                            14\n\frequirement. They are flip sides of the same coin. Texas courts, including this\n\none, understand this concept. See, e.g., City of El Paso v. Public Util. Comm’n of\n\nTex., 883 S.W.2d 179, 187 (Tex. 1994) (ratemaking formula determines “revenue\n\nrequirement”); Suburban Util. Corp. v. Public Util. Comm’n of Tex., 652 S.W.2d\n\n358, 362 (Tex. 1983) (ratemaking formula determines “cost of service”); City of\n\nDallas v. Railroad Comm’n of Tex., No. 03-06-00580-CV, 2008 WL 4823225 *1\n\n(Tex. App. – Austin Nov. 6, 2008, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (using\n\n“revenue requirement” and “cost of service” to describe the same thing). Even the\n\nAttorney General acknowledges the logical link between “revenues” and “costs” in\n\ntest-year ratemaking.37\n\n          Appellees’ witnesses acknowledged that, putting semantics aside, what ETI\n\nis seeking is a measure of expenses it will not recover as a result of implementation\n\nof the program. OPUC witness Clarence Johnson testified that the costs at issue\n\nare the embedded test-year production costs upon which base rates were\n\nestablished in Docket No. 37744.38              He confirmed that fact again on cross-\n\nexamination:\n\n          Q.     And the costs that may go unrecovered due to the CGTS [CGS]\n                 program, they are reflected as part of the overall embedded\n                 costs in the test-year—right—that the rates are set on?\n\n\n\n37\n     Id. at 36.\n38\n     See Supp. AR Part II, Binder 4, OPUC Exh. 1 (Johnson Direct at 88).\n                                                15\n\f        A.    There were costs allocated to the CGS customers and to their\n              class. So in that sense, yes.39\n\nTIEC witness Jeffry Pollock agreed on cross-examination that the Company’s\n\nproposed rider would account for migrating customers’ share of the Company’s\n\nembedded fixed production costs:\n\n        Q.    And do you agree that if a LIPS customer decides to switch to\n              CGS service that ETI will not collect the fixed production cost\n              included in the LIPS rate from that customer?\n\n        A.    I think the fact that the customer has switched [to CGS] and the\n              Company is not collecting the same revenue certainly creates\n              the potential that some costs would be uncollected...—\n              unrecovered… unless there are some additional benefits to\n              offset those unrecovered costs. That’s correct.40\n\nStaff witness Stephen Mendoza confirmed on cross-examination that lost revenues\n\ncould be a measure of unrecovered costs.41 In any event, testimony on this point is\n\nimmaterial. What constitutes “costs” under the CGS statute is a question of law,\n\nand no number of witnesses testifying that costs are not really costs can make it\n\ntrue.\n\n        The Commission repeatedly suggests that ETI’s proposed rider would enable\n\nit to recover amounts not contemplated by the test-year calculation, so ETI must\n\n\n\n39\n   See Supp. AR Part IV, Vol. E (Docket No. 37744 7/20/2010 Transcript of Hearing on the\nMerits at 350-51).\n40\n   See id. at 261-62; see also Supp. AR Part IV, Vol. D (Docket No. 37744 7/16/2010 Transcript\nof Hearing on Merits at 154-57 & 161-62).\n41\n   Supp. AR Part IV, Vol. E (Docket No. 37744 7/20/2010 Transcript of Hearing on the Merits at\n356).\n                                             16\n\fnot be seeking “costs.”42 As noted above, the rider contained a true-up provision\n\nthat would ensure ETI recovered only amounts it actually paid, not hypothetical\n\ncosts. Moreover, this argument concerns the extent to which ETI may have\n\nunrecovered costs, not whether the CGS statute entitles ETI to recover them. That\n\nETI might get limited relief in a narrow, hypothetical situation (i.e., if a new LIPS\n\ncustomer joins and participates in the CGS program) does not address or excuse\n\nthe Commission’s broad error in denying ETI a mechanism for full relief.\n\n       D.     The principle of cost-causation does not justify the\n              Commission’s disregard of language in the CGS statute.\n\n       OPUC, representing residential and small business customers, argues the\n\nCommission’s order must be sustained because charging unrecovered base-rate\n\ncosts to customers who “indisputably” did not cause them (i.e., customers\n\nineligible for the CGS program) would be unfair and contravene traditional\n\nratemaking concepts embodied in PURA.43              The Commission echoes this\n\nargument.44 This is no justification for upholding the Commission’s decision.\n\n              1.      This issue is a red herring.\n\n       ETI’s challenge to the Commission’s order does not hinge on charging\n\n“unrecovered costs” to one group of customers versus another. ETI expressed\n\nopinions about which customers may be required to pay “unrecovered costs,” but\n\n42\n   PUCT’s Brief at 24 & 33.\n43\n   OPUC’s Brief at 6.\n44\n   PUCT’s Brief at 16, 33, 35, & 41.\n                                           17\n\flargely left the issue to the parties who represent the customer groups to resolve.\n\nETI did not join in or oppose the other parties’ stipulation on the subject.45\n\n       Ultimately, the Commission did not decide which customers should pay\n\nunrecovered embedded production costs because the Commission determined they\n\nare not recoverable from anyone.46 The effect of that decision is to impose the\n\ncosts on ETI. That result is what ETI disagrees with, because it violates the CGS\n\nstatute. Appellees tilt at windmills by arguing about which customers should or\n\nmust pay unrecovered costs, or whether ETI is somehow barred from taking a\n\nposition on the issue.47 The issue here is whether ETI, rather than customers, may\n\nbe forced to bear the costs.\n\n\n\n\n45\n   AR Part I, Binder 1, Item 67 (Apr. 13, 2012, Stipulation).\n46\n   Contrary to the Commission’s Statement of Facts, nowhere in the Commission’s order is there\nany hint that the agency rejected the proposed CGSUSC rider based upon principles of equity or\nany PURA provision other than the CGS statute itself. Indeed, the Attorney General does not\ncite the Commission’s order as support for that statement. Instead, the Attorney General cites\nthe ALJ’s proposal for decision. See PUCT Brief at 6. It is true that the ALJ expressed a belief\nthat it would be inequitable to shift unrecovered LIPS-class, base-rate costs to other customer\nclasses through the CGSUSC rider. Supp. AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 36 (Docket No. 37744\nProposal for Decision at 24). That belief, coupled with the ALJ’s recognition that ETI will have\nunrecovered base rate costs that the CGS statute effectively precludes assigning to LIPS\ncustomers or ETI itself, is the reason the ALJ recommended that the CGS program not be\nadopted at all. Id. The Commission, however, did not adopt that recommendation. The\nCommission expressly reversed it, concluding that the costs are not recoverable and ordering ETI\nto implement the CGS program anyway. AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at 8).\n47\n   OPUC begins its brief by arguing that ETI, by failing to oppose a stipulation among other\nparties to the case, “waived” its right to argue that customers ineligible for the CGS program\nmay be required to pay “unrecovered costs.” OPUC’s Brief at 2-3. The Commission expressly\nfound that ETI did not waive its right to appeal unsettled issues, and reserved its rights under\napplicable state and federal law. AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 55).\n                                              18\n\f               2.     Though it may not be clear which customers\n                      should pay “unrecovered costs,” it is clear that\n                      ETI may not be required to absorb them.\n\n        It is true that the CGS statute does not expressly state which customer\n\ngroups should pay ETI’s unrecovered costs.        But there can be no reasonable\n\ndisagreement that ETI gets to recover its costs from someone. And appellees\n\nignore that, to the extent there is inequity built into the CGS program, the\n\nlegislature – not ETI – has required this result. Just as the legislature had the\n\npower to enact the general prohibition on preferential rates in PURA,48 it had the\n\npower to enact an exception to that prohibition. There is no way to implement a\n\nprogram in conformity with the terms of the CGS statute without, in some manner,\n\ncreating a preferential rate or assigning costs to customers that may not cause\n\nthem.\n\n               3.     The Commission’s brief casts doubt upon\n                      whether it would be patently unfair to allocate\n                      “unrecovered costs” to ineligible customers.\n\n        OPUC argues it is unfair to allocate to customers who are ineligible for the\n\nCGS program costs that would have been paid by LIPS customers under base\n\nrates.49   The Attorney General, too, argues that it would be “absurd,” indeed\n\n“anticompetitive,” to saddle ineligible customers with these costs.50 Implicit in\n\n\n48\n   See Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 36.003.\n49\n   OPUC’s Brief at 6.\n50\n   E.g., PUCT’s Brief at 16, 35, & 39.\n                                         19\n\fthese arguments is the assumption that LIPS customers, not others, caused these\n\ncosts.\n\n          It is strange, then, that the Attorney General elsewhere questions whether\n\nbase rate costs allocated to LIPS customers in traditional rate cases were actually\n\ncaused by LIPS customers. The Attorney General notes that test-year expenses are\n\nallocated to customer classes based on several factors, only one of which is the\n\nprinciple of “cost causation.”51\n\n          First, regardless of whether the costs were “caused” by LIPS customers, the\n\ncosts were nevertheless allocated to LIPS customers in ETI’s rate cases. They are\n\nthe costs LIPS customers avoid by migrating to the program52 and, therefore, the\n\ncosts ETI is at risk of not recovering. ETI is entitled to recover them under the\n\nCGS statute.\n\n          Second, the Attorney General’s insistence that LIPS customers do not\n\nnecessarily cause these costs defeats its own argument that it is unfair to charge\n\nthem to other customers. If the costs at issue were not necessarily caused by the\n\nLIPS class, then how can the Attorney General logically argue it violates the\n\nprinciple of cost causation to assign them to other customer classes? That makes\n\nno sense. Someone caused the costs, because the Commission has determined in\n\nrate cases that ETI reasonably and necessarily incurred them to serve customers.\n\n51\n     Id. at 36-38.\n52\n     AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 41(C)(2)-(4)).\n                                                 20\n\f             4.    If the statute inescapably dictates an\n                   unpalatably unfair result, the solution was to\n                   decline to adopt the program.\n\n      If the CGS program cannot fairly be implemented with full adherence to\n\nstatutory parameters, then the Commission could and should have declined to\n\nadopt a CGS program. PURA expressly authorizes the Commission to take that\n\nroute. Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 39.452(b). The Commission may not instead ignore\n\nthe language of the statute to create a program that it perceives to be better (but\n\ndetrimental to ETI). The legislature clearly said ETI gets to recover its costs, and\n\nthe Commission cannot ignore that mandate simply because it believes the\n\nmandate was “absurd” or difficult to comply with.\n\n      E.     Other traditional ratemaking principles do not trump the\n             plain language of the CGS statute.\n\n             1.    The CGS statute is an exception to the\n                   traditional regulatory scheme.\n\n      OPUC ignores that the legislature, in enacting the CGS statute, created an\n\nexception to the traditional regulatory scheme. A specific statutory provision\n\nprevails as an exception over a conflicting general provision. E.g., Jackson v. State\n\nOffice of Administrative Hearings, 351 S.W.3d 290, 297 (Tex. 2011). Moreover,\n\n“if statutes are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date of enactment prevails.”\n\nJackson, 351 S.W.3d at 297. The CGS statute is irreconcilable with traditional\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fratemaking principles in several respects. Because it is more specific and more\n\nrecently enacted, it controls in these respects.\n\n         OPUC argues that a statutory exception to a general rule must be “strictly”\n\nor “narrowly” construed.53        Courts have construed certain statutory “exceptions”\n\nnarrowly, but only when the language of those statutes – or some other legal\n\nprovision – has required it. Again, the principle rule of statutory construction is to\n\ngive effect to the legislature’s expression of its intent through the words it enacted.\n\nNo rule of statutory construction is paramount to that one.\n\n                2.        PURA 11.002 does not shed any light on the\n                          proper interpretation of the CGS statute.\n\n         OPUC nevertheless argues that PURA section 11.002, assuring rates that are\n\nreasonable to both customers and utilities, supports the Commission’s decision.54\n\nSee Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 11.002(a). OPUC ignores that the outcome here is not\n\nfair to the utility, which is mandated to propose this program and statutorily\n\nentitled to recover costs unrecovered as a result of it. PURA section 11.002\n\nweighs against the Commission’s decision as much as it supports it.\n\n\n\n\n53\n     OPUC’s Brief at 7.\n54\n     Id.\n                                            22\n\f               3.     The concept of “regulatory lag” does not\n                      absolve the Commission of its duty to follow the\n                      plain language of the statute.\n\n       OPUC says the “harm” from the Commission’s decision can be ameliorated\n\nin ETI’s next rate case.55 This statement ignores not only the effects of regulatory\n\nlag, but also the language in the CGS statute requiring that CGS rates be set “in the\n\nproceeding in which the [CGS] tariff is adopted.” See Tex. Util. Code Ann.\n\n§ 39.452(b).\n\n       OPUC begrudgingly acknowledges this problem, and says ETI could have\n\navoided it by requesting an adjustment to test-year billing determinants in its last\n\nrate case.56 But as the Commission found and no one disputes, it is not possible to\n\nknow the full effects of the CGS program until customers sign up and start taking\n\nservice.57\n\n       OPUC ultimately argues that it is perfectly reasonable to saddle ETI with\n\nlosses that occur during the regulatory lag period, because that is a known risk\n\nborne by utilities subject to traditional ratemaking.58 But again, the legislature in\n\nthe CGS statute crafted an exception to traditional ratemaking, and entitled ETI to\n\nits otherwise unrecovered costs.            This entitlement to full cost recovery is\n\nnecessarily an exception to the risk of regulatory lag.\n\n55\n   Id. at 13.\n56\n   Id. at 14.\n57\n   AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 57(E)).\n58\n   OPUC’s Brief at 15 & 18.\n                                              23\n\f          This statutory entitlement is also why the High Plains case is especially\n\nrelevant. That case confirms that a ratemaking agency must give a utility an\n\nopportunity to recover 100% of its reasonably incurred costs. Railroad Comm’n of\n\nTex. v. High Plains Natural Gas Co., 628 S.W.2d 753 (Tex. 1981). In the same\n\nway the Railroad Commission did in High Plains, the Commission here has\n\neliminated the opportunity to recover a portion of the reasonable and necessary\n\ncosts the utility will incur. OPUC and the Commission point out that PURA\n\ncontains a prohibition on the use of some automatic adjustment clauses, while the\n\nGas Utility Regulatory Act (“GURA”) administered by the Railroad Commission\n\ndoes not.59 See Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 36.201. That fact is irrelevant because it\n\nwas not a basis of the Court’s decision in High Plains. The decision was based\n\nupon a GURA section that has a materially identical counterpart in PURA section\n\n36.051. See High Plains, 628 S.W.2d at 753. Both provisions require the agencies\n\nto afford utilities a reasonable opportunity to recover their costs. The Commission\n\ndid not do that here.\n\n                 4.      The reference to discount rates in the CGS\n                         statute supports ETI’s argument.\n\n          OPUC and the Commission contend the legislature’s reference to PURA\n\nsection 36.007 in the CGS statute does not support ETI’s argument. First, ETI’s\n\nargument is based upon the legislature’s mandate that ETI recover its unrecovered\n\n59\n     Id. at 26; PUCT’s Brief at 43.\n                                          24\n\fcosts. The reference to section 36.007 simply supports that mandate, by allowing\n\ncosts avoided by CGS customers to be allocated to other customers. See Tex. Util.\n\nCode Ann. § 36.007(d).\n\n      Second, appellees stretch to come up with another meaning for the reference.\n\nThey contend it harks to other aspects of PURA section 36.007, which contemplate\n\nthat discounted rates may not be less than a utility’s marginal costs. They contend\n\nthe legislature, by referring to section 36.007, simply meant that CGS rates can be\n\nless than a utility’s marginal costs, to enable CGS customers to negotiate their own\n\ndeals. Either way, OPUC and the Commission argue, ETI may be forced to absorb\n\nthe costs it incurs to serve customers that migrate to the CGS program.\n\n      These musings are not supported by the language of the CGS statute. It does\n\nnot refer to one particular aspect of PURA section 36.007. It renders the whole of\n\nsection 36.007 inapplicable, and in the same sentence says ETI gets to recover any\n\nunrecovered costs. The whole sentence reads:\n\n      The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be considered to offer a\n      discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and the utility’s rates\n      shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover\n      any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\nId. § 39.452(b). The legislature obviously meant to remove the CGS program from\n\nall the limitations of the discount rate statute, including the prohibition on\n\nrecovering discounts from other customers.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\fIII.   The Commission’s decision not to allow ETI to recover all of its costs of\n       implementing the CGS tariff is reversible because it, too, contradicts the\n       plain language of the statute.\n\n       The Commission and TIEC contend that the CGS statute does not authorize\n\nETI to recover the costs of developing the CGS program because they are just a\n\n“cost of doing business.”60      But development of a CGS program is not a cost of\n\ndoing business under traditional rate regulation. The legislature mandated ETI to\n\ndesign this program, and authorized ETI to recover all the costs that result from\n\nimplementing it.\n\n       Appellees also argue that adopting a rider that allows ETI to recover costs\n\nincurred before the program goes live would enable ETI to over-recover the costs,\n\nbecause some early costs were included in base rates.61 But ETI recognized this\n\nissue and proposed to credit any of these costs that were included in base rates, so\n\nthe costs will not be recovered twice.62\n\n       The Commission says it refused to do that because it would constitute\n\nimproper retroactive ratemaking.63          The rule against retroactive ratemaking\n\nprohibits a utility commission from making a retrospective inquiry to determine\n\nwhether a prior rate was reasonable and imposing a surcharge when rates were too\n\nlow or a refund when rates were too high. State v. Public Util. Comm’n, 883\n60\n   PUCT’s Brief at 46; TIEC’s Brief at 39.\n61\n   PUCT’s Brief at 46; TIEC’s Brief at 40.\n62\n   AR Part II, Binder 3, ETI Exh. 101 (Supp. Direct Testimony of D. Roach at 15); AR Part II,\nBinder 3, ETI Exh. 103 (Supp. Rebuttal of D. Roach at 3).\n63\n   PUCT’s Brief at 47.\n                                             26\n\fS.W.2d 190, 199 (Tex. 1994). The rule requires only that the Commission and\n\ncourts abide by an administrative determination that a particular rate is just and\n\nreasonable. Office of Public Util. Counsel v. Texas-New Mexico Power Co., 344\n\nS.W.3d 446, 453 (Tex. App. – Austin 2011, pet. denied). ETI’s request, which it\n\nmade when it first proposed the CGS program in Docket No. 37744, and before the\n\ncosts at issue were even incurred, does not implicate a “prior rate.”           The\n\nCommission itself has recognized – and this Court has affirmed – that authorizing\n\nrecovery of costs in an analogous circumstance does not constitute retroactive\n\nratemaking. Office of Public Util. Counsel, 344 S.W.3d at 454. Indeed, the tariff\n\nadopted in this case contemplates a future recovery of past expenses, as it\n\nauthorizes ETI to accrue implementation costs but wait 6 months to file the CGSC\n\nrider.64 This is no basis upon which to sustain the Commission’s misapplication of\n\nthe CGS statute.\n\nIV.       The Commission’s decision not to allow ETI to recover interest on its\n          unrecovered costs is reversible because the CGS statute entitles ETI to\n          all of its unrecovered costs.\n\n          Because the CGS statute entitles ETI to recover all of its costs that are\n\nunrecovered as a result of implementation of the CGS program, ETI is entitled to\n\nrecover interest on the balance of those costs until they are recovered.        The\n\nCommission offers several purported justifications for denying ETI that interest.\n\n\n64\n     AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOFs 54(A), 57(A) & (E)).\n                                                27\n\f         First, the Commission says the unrecovered balance is “relatively small” and\n\nwill be recouped “quickly” so should be treated consistently with rate case\n\nexpenses, upon which the Commission has not historically allowed interest to\n\naccrue.65       The Commission’s historical treatment of rate case expenses is not\n\npersuasive in this context. The Commission may award rate case expenses. See\n\nTex. Util. Code Ann. § 36.061(b).         But the CGS statute does not give the\n\nCommission any discretion not to allow ETI’s unrecovered costs. And the statute\n\ndoes not say ETI may recover only its “sizable” or “significant” costs – it says\n\n“any” of its costs. Id. § 39.452(b).\n\n         Second, the Commission argues that ETI is not entitled to earn interest on\n\nunrecovered expenses under the traditional ratemaking construct.66 As explained\n\nabove, the CGS statute is a marked departure from that construct. In traditional\n\nratemaking, a utility bears some risk that its rates will not cover its actual expenses.\n\nThe CGS statute, in contrast, says ETI gets to recover costs that are unrecovered as\n\na result of the implementation of the CGS program.\n\n         When PURA entitles a utility to recover its costs dollar for dollar, PURA\n\nimpliedly requires the Commission to award interest on those costs until they are\n\nrecovered. CenterPoint Energy, Inc. v. Public Util. Comm’n of Tex., 143 S.W.3d\n\n81, 84 (Tex. 2004). The Commission misstates the basis of the Texas Supreme\n\n65\n     PUCT’s Brief at 48.\n66\n     Id. at 49.\n                                          28\n\fCourt’s holding in CenterPoint Energy, Inc. The Court reversed the Commission’s\n\nrefusal to allow utilities to accrue interest on stranded cost balances for the whole\n\ntime they were on the books. The Court expressly said that was error because\n\nrequiring a utility to wait two or three years before interest began would contradict\n\nthe utility’s statutory entitlement to recover of all its stranded costs. Id. at 84. The\n\nCourt so held even though PURA did not expressly authorize utilities to earn\n\ninterest on their unrecovered stranded costs.\n\n      The same is true here. The CGS statute does not expressly authorize ETI to\n\naccrue interest on its unrecovered cost balance. But because the statute entitles\n\nETI to all of its unrecovered costs, ETI will not be made whole unless it is able to\n\naccrue interest while the balances are unrecovered.\n\n                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      For all these reasons, Entergy Texas, Inc. respectfully requests that the Court\n\nreverse the district court’s judgment insofar as it upholds the Commission’s\n\ndecision in the respects discussed above. ETI requests that this Court remand the\n\ncase to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with the Court’s\n\ndecision. Finally, ETI requests its costs of court and any other relief to which it\n\nmay show itself justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                               DUGGINS WREN MANN & ROMERO, LLP\n\n\n                               By:     /s/ Marnie A.

Findings of Fact\n\n Procedural Histo\n 1.     On December 30, 2009, ETI filed an application requesting approval of (1) base rate\n        tariffs and riders designed to collect an overall revenue requirement of $1,758.4 million,\n        which includes a total non-fuel retail revenue requirement of $838.3 million (base rate\n        revenues of $486 million plus revenue from riders of $352.3 million); (2) a set of\n        proposed tariff schedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate Filing Package for\n        Generating Utilities (RFP) accompanying ETI's application; (3) a request for final\n        reconciliation of ETI's fuel and purchased power costs for the reconciliation period from\n        April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009; and (4) certain waivers to the instructions in RFP\n        Schedule V accompanying ETI's application.\n\n2.      The 12-month test year employed in ETI's filing ended on June 30, 2009.\n\n3.      ETI provided notice by publication for four consecutive weeks before the effective date\n\n        of the proposed rate change in newspapers having general circulation in each county of\n\n        ETI's Texas service territory. ETI also mailed notice of its proposed rate change to all of\n       its customers. Additionally, ETI timely served notice of its statement of intent to change\n\n       rates on all municipalities retaining original jurisdiction over its rates and services. ETI\n\n       also published one-time supplemental notice by publication in newspapers and by bill\n       insert.\n\n4.     The following parties were granted intervenor status in this docket:        OPUC, Cities,\n       Cottonwood, Kroger, State Agencies, TIEC, and Wal-Mart.

On January 4, 2010, the Commission referred this case to the State Office of\n       Administrative Hearings (SOAH) for processing.\n\n6.     On February 19, 2010, the ALJs issued Order No. 3, which approved an agreement\n       between ETI, Staff, Cities, State Agencies, OPUC, TIEC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart, to\n       (1) establish an interim rate increase of $17.5 million annually above ETI's then-existing\n       base rates commencing with service rendered on and after May 1, 2010 subject to\n       true-up and refund for service rendered prior to September 13, 2010 to the extent final\n\f  PUC Docket No. 37744                               Order                                         Page 3 of 15\n  SOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n          overall rates established by the Commission amounted to less than a $17.5 million rate\n          increase; (2) extend the jurisdictional deadline by which the Commission must issue a\n          final order on the Company's rate request from July 5, 2010 to November 1, 2010;\n          (3) establish a September 13, 2010 effective date for rates such that, notwithstanding the\n          extension of the jurisdictional deadline, the final overall rates established by the\n          Commission would relate back to service rendered on and after September 13, 2010;\n          (4) require ETI to publish supplemental notice, once in newspapers and by a bill insert,\n          setting forth the effect of its proposed rate change in terms of the percentage increase in\n         non-fuel revenues; and (5) establish a procedural schedule and discovery deadlines for\n         this proceeding.      Order No. 3 also granted Mr. Kurt Boehm's motion for admission\n         pro hac vice as counsel for Kroger and ETI's February 3 and February 11, 2010 petitions\n         for review of cities' ordinances and motions to consolidate with respect to the rate\n         decisions adopted by the Cities of Ames, Anderson, Bedias, Bevil Oaks, Bremond,\n         Caldwell, Calvert, Chester, China, Colmesneil, Corrigan, Cut and Shoot, Daisetta,\n         Dayton, Devers, Franklin, Groveton, Hardin, Hearne, Iola, Kosse, Kountze, Liberty,\n         Lumberton, Madisonville, Midway, New Waverly, Normangee, Nome, Patton Village,\n         Plum Grove, Riverside, Rose Hill Acres, Somerville, Taylor Landing, Todd Mission,\n         Trinity, and Woodville.\n\n7.

The hearing on the merits commenced on July 13, 2010 and was immediately recessed in\n           order to facilitate settlement negotiations.                  The hearing was again convened on\n           July 15, 2010, at which time the signatories announced their intent to continue settlement\n           discussions to resolve all issues related to the Company's application with the exception\n           of those related to ETI's proposal for competitive generation service (CGS) and\n           associated riders.\n\n 9.        On August 6, 2010, the signatories submitted the stipulation resolving all outstanding\n          issues regarding the Company's application with the exception of those related to ETI's\n          CGS proposal. Under the stipulation, ETI will be allowed to implement base rate tariffs\n\n          and riders designed to collect an overall revenue requirement of $1,614.9 million,4 which\n          includes a total non-fuel retail revenue requirement of $694.9 million (base rate revenues\n          of $599 million plus revenue from riders of $95.9 million).                            The signatories also\n          submitted, on August 6, 2010, an agreed motion to revise interim rates and to consolidate\n          the severed rate-case expense docket. The interim rates requested in the agreed motion\n          mirrored the final rates proposed for Commission approval in the stipulation. The agreed\n          motion further requested that the ALJs consolidate with the instant proceeding Docket\n          No. 38346, related to severed Docket No. 37744 rate case expense issues, and admit the\n          parties' pre-filed exhibits into evidence.\n\n 10.      On July 16 and July 20, 2010, the ALJs held the hearing on the merits with respect to\n          ETI's CGS proposal.\n\n11.       On August 9, 2010, the ALJs issued Order No. 12, granting approval of revised interim\n          rates for usage on and after August 15, 2010.\n\n12.      On October 5, 2010, the ALJs issued a proposal for decision regarding issues related to\n         ETI's CGS proposal.\n\n13.      On October 5, 2010, the ALJs issued Order No. 13, ordering the consolidation of Docket\n         No. 38346, related to severed rate-case expense issues, into the instant proceeding,\n\n\n\n\n         4 This figure includes fuel at test year prices. If current fuel prices are substituted for test year fuel prices,\nthe overall revenue requirement figure would be $1,504.0 million.\n\f PUC Docket No. 37744                            Order                                      Page 5 of 15\n SOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n        admitting evidence, and returning this docket to the Commission consistent with the\n        agreed motion filed on August 6, 2010.\n\n 14.    The   Commission considered this           Docket      at   the   November 10, 2010 and\n        December 1, 2010 open meetings.\n\n 15.    On November 30, 2010 ETI filed an unopposed motion to sever the competitive CGS\n        issues from the settled issues in this docket. The Commission granted the motion at the\n        December 1, 2010 open meeting and the Commission's decision was memorialized in\n        Order No. 14 issued on December 3, 2010. The CGS issues were severed into Docket\n        No. 38951 in Order No. 14.\n\nDescription of the stipulation and Settlement Agreement\n16.    The signatories to the settlement stipulated that ETI should be allowed to implement an\n       initial overall increase in base-rate revenues of $59 million for usage on and after\n\n       August 15, 2010.

The signatories further stipulated that ETI\n       should be allowed to implement an additional overall increase in base-rate revenues of\n       $9 million on an annualized basis effective for bills rendered on and after May 2, 2011,\n       the first billing cycle for the revenue month of May.\n\n17.

The signatories stipulated to the amount of transmission and distribution invested capital\n       by function as of June 30, 2009 as set out in attachment 1 to the stipulation.\n\f PUC Docket No. 37744                              Order                                  Page 6 of 15\n SOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n 20.

The signatories stipulated that the Company's proposed transmission cost recovery factor\n        (TCRF) will not be approved in this docket. The signatories stipulated to the baseline\n        values as shown in attachment 2 to the stipulation to be used in the Company's request, if\n        any, for a TCRF in a separate proceeding.\n\n22.     The signatories agreed that ETI's proposed cost-of-service adjustment rider and formula\n        rate plan will not be approved in this docket.\n\n23.     The signatories stipulated that the Company's proposed renewable-energy-credit rider\n\n       will not be approved in this docket, and the Company's renewable-energy-credit costs\n       shall be recovered in base rates.      The signatories further stipulated that a transmission\n       customer that opts out pursuant to P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.173(j) shall receive a credit that\n\n       offsets the amount of renewable-energy-credit costs that are recovered in base rates from\n       the transmission customer.\n\n24.    The signatories agreed that ETI's proposed remote-communications-link rider should be\n       approved as filed by the Company.\n\n25.    The signatories agreed that ETI's proposed market-valued-energy-reduction service rider\n       will not be approved in this docket.\n\n26.    The signatories reached the following specific agreements regarding rate design as a part\n       of the overall resolution of this docket:\n\n       a.      Rate Schedule IS.     Rate Schedule IS will be opened to new business. In the\n              Company's next base-rate case, the amount of interruptible credits recoverable\n              from Texas retail customers shall be limited to an increase of $1 million more\n              than the amount requested in this docket (or a total of $6.8 million); provided,\n              however, that in the next rate case, the Company may request an exception to this\n              limitation upon a showing that the test-year credit amount in excess of the\n              $6.8 million cap is both cost effective and necessary to meet the Company's\n              generation reserve margin requirement.       The signatories further agreed that the\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                      Page 7 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n              Company will not offer additional interruptible service if the availability of total\n              interruptible service supplied by the Company under all interruptible service\n              riders exceeds 5% of the projected aggregate Company peak demand unless the\n              additional level of interruptible service offered in excess of the 5% cap is both\n              cost effective and necessary to meet the Company's generation reserve margin\n              requirement. To the extent that the credit amount or participation level exceeds\n              the limitations described in this paragraph and the Company includes test-year\n               credits over the $6.8 million credit-amount cap or additional participation in\n               excess of the 5% participation-level cap in its next rate case, the Company shall\n              have the burden to prove whether those test-year credits or participation levels\n               meet the standards established in this paragraph for inclusion in the test year. The\n               standards in this paragraph are in addition to any requirements in PURA for\n               inclusion of costs in rates.   The signatories further agreed to the Schedule IS\n               revisions shown on attachment 3 to the stipulation.\n\n       b.      Rate Schedule IHE. The signatories agreed that no change shall be made to rate\n               schedule IHE in this docket.\n\n       c.      Lighting Class Rates.     The signatories stipulated that the language under the\n               paragraph relating to rate group C in rate schedule SHL will be revised to reflect\n               that, where the Company agrees to install facilities other than its standard street\n               light fixture and lamp as provided under Rate Group A, a lump sum payment will\n               be required, based upon the installed cost of all facilities excluding the cost of the\n               standard street light fixture and lamp, and the customer will be billed under rate\n               group A.\n\n       e.

The signatories further agreed that\n                 the under-recovered balance of Rider IPCR costs shall be booked as fuel expense\n                 in the month in which the Commission issues an order adopting the stipulation;\n                 provided, however, that the under-recovered balance shall be allocated to\n                 customer classes using A&E4CP.\n\n        c.        Rough Production Cost Equalization (RPCE) Payments. The signatories agreed\n                  that ETI will credit an additional $18.6 million to Texas fuel-factor customers,\n                  which the signatories stipulated represents the remaining portion of RPCE\n                  payments ETI received in 2007 that were at issue in Docket No. 35269.6 The\n                  RPCE credit shall be allocated to rate classes based on loss-adjusted kilowatt\n                  hours at plant for calendar year 2006.

Considered in light of (1) the pre-filed testimony by the parties entered into evidence and\n        (2) the additional evidence and testimony admitted during the course of the hearing on\n        the merits on the Company's application, the stipulation is the result of compromise from\n        each signatory, and these efforts, as well as the overall result of the stipulation viewed in\n        light of the record evidence as a whole, support the reasonableness and benefits of the\n\n        terms of the stipulation.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                            Order                                     Page 11 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n35.    The evidence addressed in finding of fact 34 demonstrates that the rates, terms, and\n       conditions resulting from the stipulation are just and reasonable and consistent with the\n       public interest.\n\n36.    The total level of the Texas retail revenue requirement contemplated by the stipulation\n       will allow ETI the opportunity to earn a reasonable return over and above its reasonable\n       and necessary operating expense.\n\n37.    The stipulated revenue requirement is consistent with applicable provisions of PURA\n       chapter 36 and the Commission's rules.\n\n38.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n       fuel expense, they are reasonable and necessary for each class of affiliate costs presented\n       in ETI's application.\n\n39.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n       fuel expense, the price charged to ETI is not higher than the prices charged by the\n       supplying affiliate for the same item or class of items to its other affiliates or divisions, or\n       a non-affiliated person within the same market area or having the same market\n       conditions.\n\n40.    The retail revenue requirement in the stipulation does not include any expenses\n       prohibited from recovery under PURA.\n\n41.    A return on equity of 10.125% and a weighted average cost of capital of 8.5209% for ETI\n       should be adopted consistent with the stipulation.\n\n42.    The agreed rate-design provisions and terms and conditions of service included in the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n43.    The treatment of rate-case expenses described in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n44.

The recovery of $2,019,000 annually for decommissioning costs of nuclear production\n       assets based on the factors agreed to in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n47.    A $3.65 million annual storm cost accrual is reasonable.\n\n48.    The class allocation methodologies described in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n49.    The fuel and IPCR-related provisions of the stipulation are reasonable.\n\n\n\n                                    H.     Conclusions of Law\n1.     ETI is a public utility as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004(1) and an electric utility\n       as that term is defined in PURA § 31.002(6).\n\n2.     The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter of this application pursuant to PURA §§ 14.001, 32.001, 32.101, 33.002, 33.051,\n        36.001-.111, 36.203, 39.452, and 39.455.\n\n3.      SOAH has jurisdiction over matters related to the conduct of the hearing and the\n       preparation of a proposal for decision in this docket, pursuant to PURA § 14.053 and\n        TEx. Gov'T CODE ANN. § 2003.049.\n\n4.      This docket was processed in accordance with the requirements of PURA, the Texas\n        Administrative Procedure Act,g and Commission rules.\n\n5.      ETI provided notice of its application in compliance with PURA § 36.103, P.U.C. PROC.\n        R. 22.51(a), and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.235(b)(1)-(3).\n\n6.      This docket contains no remaining contested issues of fact or law.\n\n7.      The stipulation, taken as a whole, is a just and reasonable resolution of all issues it\n        addresses; results in just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions; is supported by a\n        preponderance of the credible evidence in the record; is consistent with the relevant\n        provisions of PURA; and is consistent with the public interest.\n\n 8.     ETI has properly accounted for the amount of fuel and IPCR-related revenues collected\n        pursuant to the fuel factor and Rider IPCR.\n\n\n        8 TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. Chapter 2001 (Vernon 2007 and Supp. 2009).\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                   Page 13 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n9.     The revenue requirement, cost allocation, revenue distribution, and rate design\n       implementing the stipulation result in rates that are just and reasonable, comply with the\n       ratemaking provisions in PURA, and are not unreasonably discriminatory, preferential, or\n       prejudicial.\n\n10.    Based on the evidence in this docket, the overall total invested capital through the end of\n       the test year meets the requirement in PURA § 36.053(a) that electric utility rates be\n       based on the original cost, less depreciation, of property used by and useful to the utility\n       in providing service.\n\n11.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that it is entitled to the level of retail\n       base rate and rider revenue set out in the stipulation.\n\n12.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that the rates resulting from the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable, and consistent with PURA.\n\n\n\n                                 III.

ETI's application seeking authority to change its rates; reconcile its fuel and purchased\n       power costs for the Reconciliation Period from April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009; and for\n       other related relief is approved consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n       of law.\n\n2.     Rates, terms, and conditions consistent with the stipulation are approved.\n\n3.     The tariffs and riders consistent with the stipulation are approved for the initial and\n       second step rate increases.\n\n4.     ETI's request for waivers of RFP instructions (RFP Schedule V) is granted.\n\n5.     ETI shall adjust decommissioning expense related to the River Bend Nuclear Generating\n       Station consistent with the terms of this Order.\n\n6.     Neither the stipulation and settlement agreement nor this Order constitutes the\n       Commission's agreement with, or consent to, the manner in which ETI, or any entity\n       affiliated with ETI, has interacted with any decommissioning trust to which ETI or its\n       ratepayers have made contributions or provided funds.

Nothing contained in this Order constitutes the consent or approval, explicit or implied,\n        of any modification, amendment or clarification of any power purchase agreement\n        between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station.        Without\n\n        limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Order shall constitute the consent or\n        approval of any modification, amendment, or clarification of any power purchase\n        agreement between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station,\n        which is made to address any concerns raised by the NRC in its Request for Additional\n        Information regarding the River Bend Station dated March 11, 2010.\n\n 8.     The Rider IPCR costs and eligible fuel costs requested by ETI are, consistent with this\n        Order, reconciled through June 30, 2009, and are approved consistent with the\n\n        stipulation.\n\n 9.     ETI shall adjust its fuel over/under recovery balance consistent with the findings in this\n\n        Order.\n\n 10.    ETI shall file an RPCEA Rider consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n        of law to be effective with the first billing cycle of the billing month immediately\n        following the effective date of this Order..\n\n 11.    Because the final approved rates are equal to or higher than the interim rates adopted in\n        Order No. 3, no refund of the interim rates authorized by Order No. 3 is necessary.\n\n 12.    The interim rates approved in Order No. 12 are herby approved for the initial step rate\n         increase contemplated by the stipulation, and ETI shall implement the second step rates\n         for bills rendered on and after May 2, 2011, the first billing cycle for the revenue month\n\n         of May.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                                Order                                 Page 15 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n13.       Within 30 days of the date of this Order, ETI shall file a clean copy of all of the tariffs\n          and schedules approved in this docket and a clean copy of the attachments to the\n          stipulation.\n\n14.

INTRODUCTION\n\n\n       On December 30, 2009, Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETl or Company) filed its application for\nauthority to change rates and reconcile fuel costs (Application). On July 13, 2010, the parties\nappeared for the hearing on the merits. At the beginning of the hearing, the parties informed the\nAdministrative Law Judges (ALJs) that they were engaged in settlement negotiations.                         On\nJuly 15, 2010, the parties advised the ALJs that there was a settlement in principle on all issues\nin the case except for ETl's Competitive Generation Service (CGS) proposal. Concurrent with\nthis Proposal for Decision (PFD) the AU is forwarding to the Commission the parties'\nStipulation and Settlement Agreement and Proposed Final Order filed on August 6, 2010. The\nALJ recommends that the Commission reject ETl's CGS proposal. However, the Commission\nmay disagree. As a result, the ALJ provides a full discussion of the parties' arguments.\n\n\n                                      II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       On July 16 and July 20, 2010, the parties attended a limited hearing on the merits for\nissues solely related to CGS. 1 ALJ Travis Vickery presided and drafted this PFD. The following\nparties attended the hearing on the merits and submitted post-hearing briefing: ETl, Staff of the\nPublic Utility Commission of Texas (PUC or Commission), Office of Public Utility Counsel of\nTexas (OPUC), State of Texas' Agencies and Institutions of Higher Education (State),\nCottonwood Energy Company, L.P. (Cottonwood), and Texas Industrial Energy Consumers\n\n\n\n\n       I   In the interests ofjudicial economy, the AU has borrowed liberally from the parties' briefing.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

SUMMARY\n\n\n         All parties that participated in the hearing, except TIEC and Cottonwood, oppose ETI's\nCGS proposal, including Staff (referred to generally as opponents). In general, the opponents\nargue that the Company's proposed CGS tariff runs contrary to legislative intent and sound\neconomic and public policy. These parties, however, also make arguments in the alternative.\nCottonwood argues only that independent power producers (IPPs) be included as eligible\nsuppliers. TIEC argues that the program should be approved with certain modifications.\n\n\n         Although the ALJ offers a discussion of the major Issues raised by the parties, he\nrecommends rejection ofETI's CGS proposal. ETI, as a regulated member ofa multi-state set of\nrelated utilities, is limited in its ability to propose a CGS program that offers somewhat\ncompetitive choice to a limited class of customers. The ALJ finds that ETI's CGS proposal\nreflects a good faith attempt to navigate the conflicting interplay of its status within the Entergy\nsystem, principles of traditional ratemaking, and the competitive goals of the CGS legislation.\nThe ALJ's primary reasons for recommending rejection of the proposal echoes the opponents'\narguments: the anticipated costs are not ascertainable until the program has been implemented;\nand these potentially substantial costs are shifted to parties who may chose not to, or are not\neligible to, participate in the program.\n\n\n         Although ETI is a necessary third party to any transaction between a CGS supplier and\ncustomer, it has attempted to render itself neutral by adopting a pass-through rate for supplier\nand customer. The fundamental problem is, for every customer that migrates to the program,\nETI loses a customer that contributes to the recovery of its embedded production costs. As\n\n       2 The following parties intervened or participated in this docket: Staff, OPUC, the State, Cities,\nCottonwood, TIEC, Kroger Co., and Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and Sam's East, Inc. (Wal-Mart).\n        3 Although a number of parties proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the ALJ adopted\nStaffs with limited modifications.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 3\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\nexplained below, the CGS legislation makes clear ETl is not to bear any costs as a result of the\nimplementation of the program. As a result, ETl's proposal shifts the bulk of these unrecovered\ncosts to all non-participating customers. This cost-shifting violates the basic principal of cost-\ncausation. Although the parties offered some discussion of legislative intent, the ALJ is not\nconvinced that this cost-shifting was intended by the Legislature. It is clear, however, that the\ndrafters sought to create a program that offers competitive choice to certain ETl customers.\nAlthough the ALJ recommends rejection, he also understands the Commission may find, as a\nmatter of policy, that the Legislature's intent to develop a competitive set of suppliers overrides\nthe principal of cost-causation.\n\n\n                                         IV. BACKGROUND\n\nA.          The CGS Legislation\n\n\n            The Company's proposed CGS program in this proceeding is the product of legislation\nfirst enacted in 2005 as House Bill 1567. 4 The bill addressed a number of issues related to the\ntiming of rate cases and cost recovery during Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s (EGSI) efforts to\ntransition to retail open access. The legislation authorized EGSI to file a rate proceeding with an\neffective date no earlier than June 30, 2008, and stipulated that as a part of that rate proceeding:\n\n        [t]he utility shall propose a competitive generation tariff to allow eligible\n        customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The commission\n        shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff The tariffs subject to this\n        subsection may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section\n        36.007, and the utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is\n        adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the\n        tariffS\n\n\n\n\n       4 Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UIIL. CODE ANN., §§ 39.451 - 39.463 (Vernon 1998 & Supp. 2005)\n(PURA 2005).\n        5   PURA 2005 at § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 4\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n         To comply with HB 1567, EGSI submitted a CGS proposal as part of its application in\nDocket No. 34800. 6            In that proposal, CGS customers were to be treated as wholesale\ntransmission customers so they could seek competitive wholesale generation supply on the same\ntenns as other wholesale market participants. The Commission approved a settlement of that\nproceeding whereby the Company's CGS proposal was severed into a separate proceeding, 7\nDocket No. 36713. 8\n\n\n         Soon after the resolution of Docket No. 34800 and initiation of Docket No. 36713, the\nTexas Legislature enacted House Bill 1492, which, among other things, altered the Company's\nobligations with regard to the transition to retail open access and significantly amended the\nprovisions of PURA § 39.452(b) that addressed the requirements of a proposed competitive\ngeneration tariff, which now reads:\n\n\n         An electric utility subject to this subchapter shall propose a competItIve\n         generation tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive\n         generation. The commission shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff\n         not later than September 1,2010. The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be\n         considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and the\n         utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to\n         recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff. The\n         commission shall ensure that a competitive generation tariff shall not be\n         implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of\n         manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.\n         Pursuant to the competitive generation tariff, an electric utility subject to this\n         subsection shall purchase competitive generation service, selected by the\n         customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer. An electric utility\n         subject to this subsection shall provide and price retail transmission service,\n         including necessary ancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take\n         advantage of the competitive generation tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the\n         utility's cost of service. Such customers shall not be considered wholesale\n         transmission customers. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the\n         commission may not issue a decision relating to a competitive generation tariff\n\n\n        6 Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket\nNo. 34800 (Mar. 16,2009).\n         7   Id., Final Order at FoF 32, Ordering Paragraph No.5.\n         8 Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Approval of Competitive Generation Services Tariff, Docket\nNo. 36713 (pending).

Under the proposal, the eligible customers are Large\nIndustrial Power Service (LIPS) and LIPS Time-of-Day rate schedule customers.                         A   cas\ncustomer would have the ability to contract with a participating COS supplier (an eligible QF\nlocated in ETl's service territory) that puts energy to ETl for a set amount of load at an agreed\nupon price. The      cas customer must designate what portion of its load will be served by its cas\nsupplier under the COS tariff and what portion will be served under the applicable LIPS tariff\nrate.\n\n\n        So long as the COS supplier provides the energy contracted by the                cas buyer, ETI will\ncontinue to purchase energy from the QF at the avoided cost rate and the COS customer will pay\nETl the avoided cost rate for the level contracted for in place of all generation related\ncomponents that would otherwise be billed under the LIPS tariff. A                  cas customer and a QF\nsupplier are free to contract, without ETl's participation, for a price other than avoided cost, in\nwhich case, the costs above or below the avoided costs would be accounted for in payments\nbetween the COS customer and COS supplier, or vice versa, as prescribed by the contract. 10\n\n\n        ETl explains that the COS customer could avoid costs it would otherwise incur under the\nCompany's fixed fuel factor, along with the portion of the Company's retail rates that represent\nembedded production costs. Transmission service associated with the delivery of power would\nbe provided at an unbundled retail rate. In the event the QF with whom the COS customer has\ncontracted fails to deliver the contracted-for power, the Company would provide service at an\n\"Unserved Energy\" rate. The initial period of implementation would be one-year, beginning in\nJanuary 2011, followed by a Company report to the Commission.

Costs will be based on estimates and ETI proposes\nthey be trued-up on an annual basis to match what the Company has actually incurred as a result\nof the program. As proposed, the costs would be recovered from all CGS eligible customers\n                                                                                                    12\n(LIPS) through Rider CGSC regardless of whether they actually take the CGS service.\n\n\n       3.          The CGSUSC Rider\n\n\n        ETI proposes the CGSUSC rider to recover avoided embedded generation costs that\nwould have been allocated to LIPS customers under ETI's retail base rates, had those customers\nnot elected to participate in CGS. Rider CGSUSC is designed to recover the difference between\nwhat would have been billed by ETI under traditional LIPS service and what is billed under the\ncombined CGS tariff and modified LIPS service. Rider CGSUSC would recover embedded\ngeneration costs and ',Uly other related base rate costs and would apply to all non-participating\ncustomers across all classes, including LIPS customers not participating in the CGS program,\nthrough a rider that will be trued-up against the actual avoided embedded generation costs and\nreset on an annual basis. 13\n\n\n        4.

Eligible Customers\n\n\n         Participation in the CGS tariff is limited to LIPS customers.                 The parties, however,\ndisagree over the definition of \"eligible customers\" under PURA § 39.452(b). Cities and the\nState propose expanding the program to include additional and perhaps all customer classes. ETI\ncounters that the limitation to LIPS is supported by the statute and practical constraints on the\nmakeup of a customer class. Although the ALJ ultimately recommends rejection of ETl's CGS\nproposal, in the event the Commission approves the tariff, the limitation to LIPS customers is\nacceptable for initial implementation of the program. 20\n\n\n         ETI argues that the term \"eligible\" naturally implies a limitation on customer class and\nthat the provision is not explicit as to the parameters of eligibility. However, based on the\nbackground and context ofPURA § 39.452(b), ETI argues that the term \"manufacturers\" should\nbe viewed as a reference to large manufacturing concerns such as industrial customers. 21 ETI\nalso argues that the limitation to LIPS was based on a number of practical factors, including:\n\n\n\n\n        18    ETI Ex. 73 at 13, Ex.

Based on ETl's\nproposal, a limited pool of eligible customers also results in allocating unrecovered costs across a\nlarger pool of non-participants.              This will mitigate the potential impact on all customers,\nincluding, as required by the statute, non-participating manufacturers.            On the flipside, ETI\nargues that expanding the pool of eligible customers would increase start-up and implementation\ncosts, spread over a smaller pool of non-participants -- something Cities concedes. 23 According\nto established rate setting principles, ETI argues those increased costs should be borne by the\nlarger pool of eligible customers. ETI notes, however, there is little to no likelihood, and no\nevidence that Cities' proposed expanded customer class would actually participate in the\nprogram. Finally, under the current proposal, any increase in the amount of unrecovered costs\nwould also be borne by non-participants, including manufacturers.\n\n\n       Although the State's witness also testified that the customer class should be expanded,\nCities framed strong arguments that the LIPS limitation should be rejected. Cities propose that\nthe program be available to any customer who has the demand and resources to contract for\nCGS. Cities acknowledges not every customer will possess the means to contract for or accept\nsuch service. Nevertheless, Cities contend that ETl's limit to the LIPS class is too narrow.\n\n\n\n\n       22   ETI Ex. 9 at 10-11; Tr. at 253.\n       23   Cities Initial Brief at 8-9.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE 11\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n       First, Cities argue that LIPS class customers do not possess a monopoly of sophistication\nto contract for CGS service. Where demand is concerned, Cities note that some non-LIPS\ncustomers' combined demand may exceed 5 MW, in addition to the fact that some suppliers may\nbe willing to contract for less than 5 MW. As for interval data recording meters, Cities argue\nthat some customers' demand is constant, such as the City of Beaumont, which has some 10,000\nstreet lights for which billing is unmetered. Although Cities provided no record cites for these\npropositions, its main point is that certain customers outside the LIPS class may be in a position\nto contract for and benefit from the CGS program. Finally, with regard to increased startup and\nadministration costs associated with an expanded customer class, Cities proposes that only\nparticipants be responsible for cost recovery on a kWh basis.\n\n\n       Staffs position is that, while the term \"eligible\" is a limitation on the customer class, the\nprovision's reference to \"manufacturers\" does not mandate the program's limitation to LIPS\ncustomers. Not all LIPS customers are manufacturers and some manufacturers may be members\nof commercial classes. 24 Nevertheless, Staff also acknowledges there may be other issues which\njustify ETI's limitation to customers in the LIPS class.\n\n\n       The ALl agrees with ETI and Staff that the term \"eligible\" in PURA § 39.452(b) implies\nETI should limit participation in the program to certain customers. Although the provision does\nnot define the terms of eligibility, the reference to \"manufacturers\" suggests that the program\nshould be extended to ETI's larger customers, but as noted by Cities, Staff, and other opponents,\nthe LIPS class is not a perfect fit for all of ETI's customers engaged in manufacturing.\nNevertheless, the ALl finds that ETI has articulated a reasonable and practical limit on the CGS\neligible customer class for the implementation of the program. Based on the uncertain nature of\nETI's cost estimates and unknown levels of participation, there are too many unexplored\nvariables involved in expanding the customer class beyond LIPS customers at this time. In the\nevent the Commission approves the CGS proposal, the ALl recommends eligible customers be\nlimited to the LIPS class, leaving open the possibility for further expansion as the program\ndevelops.\n\n\n\n       24   Cities share this view.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Eligible Suppliers\n\n\n       As proposed by ETI, eligible suppliers for the CGS program are limited to fourteen QFs\nwithin ETl's service territory.25 These QFs are facilities that generate power for their own use,\nand then sell their excess power to ETI. ETI is required by federal law to purchase that excess\npower regardless of the CGS program. 26 ETI claims that QF suppliers within its own service\narea are the only source of power it could incorporate into the CGS program without running\nafoul of the System Agreement, because energy put by QFs located in ETl's service territory is\nallocated to ETI through the System Agreement, so that dedicating that energy to CGS supply\ndoes not upset the allocation of energy or costs among the Entergy Operating Companies. 27 ETI\nalso describes QF put as a viable supply option for the CGS program because the delivery of that\nenergy can be controlled by the CGS customer and the QF.\n\n\n       Cities and other intervenors generally argue that the limitation on eligible suppliers does\nnot do enough to bring competition to the market. TlEC witness Jeffry Pollock echoed this\nconcern when he testified that there is simply not enough capacity available in ETl's plan to\nallow for true competition. 28 Aside from the limited number of QFs eligible to participate,\ncompetition is further limited because QFs must first meet their own power needs before they put\nto ETI. 29 And Cities argue that even if IPPs currently dedicated to serving ETI are added to the\nsupply, there is still too little competition, because that power is already under contract by ETI or\nis required to be purchased by ETI.\n\n\n       ETI responds, and the ALJ agrees, that PURA § 39.452(b) does not require ETI to\ndevelop a CGS program that mimics an open market. That would be impossible. ETI is a\nregulated entity and part of a multi-state utility system, whose available resources and resource\nand cost allocations are governed by the Operating Committee as sanctioned by the FERC. It is\n\n\n       25   TIEC Ex. 1 at 14.\n       26   Tr. at 51,67-68.\n       27   ETI Ex. 73 at 11-12.\n       28   TIEC Ex. 1 at 38.\n       29   TIEC Ex. 1 at 67-68.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Instead, the CGS program is intended to give eligible customers a supply\nalternative to ETI's generation. It is not intended to be retail open access, and the amendments\nto the CGS provision in the 2009 legislation law make it clear that the program should not make\nthe CGS customer a wholesale market participant.\n\n\n                  a.       Expanding the Supply to Include IPPs\n\n\n        TIEC proposes that CGS suppliers be expanded to include IPPs currently dedicated to\nserving ETI. ETI argues, however, that while this proposal would avoid interference with the\nresource allocation principles of the System Agreement, it still runs afoul of the economic\ndispatch requirements of the System Agreement. ETI points out that the System Agreement\ndictates the dispatch of System resources using the lowest cost resources capable of reliably\nserving load for the System as a whole and without regard to which Operating Company owns or\ncontrols the resource. The System Agreement does not permit the dispatch of certain resources\nout of order for the benefit of a single Operating Company or customers in a particular\njurisdiction.30\n\n\n        ETI argues that including IPP suppliers would be detrimental to CGS customers because\nthey have no control over the delivery of energy from IPPs. Because System economics dictate\nthe scheduling of energy from IPPs, System needs may not align with the needs CGS customers\nin any given hour. Under these circumstances, the System's economic dispatch decisions for\nIPPs would prevail and CGS customers would incur significant Unserved Energy costs when IPP\nresources selected by a CGS customer are not included in economic dispatch for a period of\n     3\ntime. ! Cities made the same argument in briefing, also noting \"CGS must be limited to power\nthat is already allocated to ETI under the terms of the System Agreement.,,32 The ALJ agrees\nwith ETI that using QF put allows the CGS customer and QF to agree on delivery terms that\n\n\n\n       30   ETI Ex. 41 at 9-10.\n       31   ETI Ex. 73 at 11-16.\n       32   ETI Ex. 73 at 11-12.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Cities\npoint out that, at most, the Company only has capacity contracts with two-fifths of the IPPs in its\nservice territory.35\n\n\n        There is insufficient evidence, however, to determine what the impact of including IPPs\nin the COS power supply would be. IPPs could presumably be a source of firm power under the\nprogram, which would allow the Company to eliminate the costs it would have incurred to\nprovide firm power to its COS customers rather than simply passing those costs on to ineligible\ncustomers. On the other hand, the Company claims that its System Agreement precludes it from\nincluding IPPs in its pool of eligible suppliers,36 and including IPPs could raise fuel costs for\nother customers because COS customers could effectively skim the lower-priced fuel out of\nETI's supply.37 OPUC witness Clarence Johnson pointed out that the impact of including IPPs\nas eligible suppliers may be to increase purchased power costs for non-COS customers. 38 To the\nextent that including IPPs in the COS power supply would harm non-participating customers,\nCities opposes such a modification to the CGS tariff. If, however, the CGSUSC rider were either\nrejected or modified so that it does not shift unrecovered costs to ineligible customers and other\nprotections were put in place, Cities would recommend including IPPs as a way to make the\nCOS program truly competitive. As explained below, however, if such costs are recovered from\nCOS participants, there is little conceivable incentive for participation in the program. The ALJ\nconcludes that expanding the pool of suppliers to IPPs and QFs not currently under capacity\n\n\n       33   !d.\n       34   Tr. at 129-130.\n       35   Tr. at 54.\n       36   ETI Ex. 52 at 36, note 4.\n       37   Tr. at 129.\n       38   OPC Ex. 4 at 10, Ex.

Expanding the Supply to Include Cottonwood\n\n\n           Cottonwood seeks to participate in the CGS program as a supplier. Cottonwood argues\nthat it is on equal footing with QFs.              ETl argues, however, that PURPA only requires the\nCompany to purchase QF put, not that of an independent generator like Cottonwood.\nCottonwood also argues that ETl would not actually purchase QF put for CGS customers. ETl\nand the ALl disagree. PURA § 39.452(b) states: \"pursuant to the competitive generation tariff,\nan electric utility subject to this subsection shall purchase competitive generation service ... ,,39\nFinally, Cottonwood suggests that the System Agreement be amended to permit Cottonwood to\nparticipate in the CGS program. As noted by ETl, this would interfere with the FERC-approved\nSystem Agreement, which is specifically prohibited by PURA § 39.452(b). The ALl concludes\nthat Cottonwood's proposal to be included as an eligible CGS supplier should be denied.\n\n\n                      c.      Expanding the Supply to Include Out-of-State QFs\n\n\n           TIEC proposes to expand the CGS supply pool by including QFs located elsewhere on\nthe Entergy System. Under that proposal, a CGS customer in Texas would be permitted to\ncontract for energy supply from a QF in Louisiana. ETI opposes this proposal, arguing that it\nwould upset energy allocation under the System Agreement because it would require allocation\nof energy put by a Louisiana QF to ETl. ETl argues that the Operating Committee has already\nexercised its discretion on this issue and determined that QF put is to be allocated to the host\nOperating Company.40 ETI notes that the Operating Committee has never allocated QF put from\none Operating Company's service area to an Operating Company in another jurisdiction. 41 ETl\nargues that implementation of the CGS program does not justifies such a change. The ALl\nagrees.\n\n          39   PURA § 39.452(b).\n          40   ETI Ex. 73 at 12-13, Ex. IPH-R-2.\n          41   Tr. at 89.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

The Supreme Court has held that\nmatters delegated to the Operating Committee as part of its duties to administer the System\nAgreement are matters of exclusive FERC jurisdiction.42 As a result, there is no basis for a state\nregulator to direct how QF put should be allocated among the Entergy Operating Companies.\n\n\n        ETl argues that even TIEC's expert witness Jeffry Pollock acknowledged that the\nreallocation of lower-cost QF put from Louisiana customers to Texas customers could raise costs\nto Louisiana customers to benefit Texas CGS customers. 43 ETl witness John Hurstell testified\nthat expanding the pool of CGS energy suppliers as proposed by TIEC requires abandonment of\nthe System Agreement to allocate out-of-state QF pUt,44 The ALJ agrees with ETl that, even if\nTIEC's proposal did not violate the System Agreement, it makes little sense for the Operating\nCommittee to reallocate QF put for the sole purpose of expanding the CGS supply pool for the\nbenefit of a small number of Texas industrial customers and the detriment of customers in other\nEntergy System jurisdictions.          Finally, ETl questions whether the Commission could even\nenforce such an obligation.\n\n\n       Cities note that including QFs outside of ETl's servIce area may benefit eligible\ncustomers by increasing the diversity of available power and providing a more competitive\nmarket,45 Cities, however, only supports the inclusion of QFs outside ETl's service area, if it\nwould not increase costs to non-participating customers.                This is not likely under the CGS\nprogram, because supply options are still limited to QFs, which have discretion to put energy to\nETl.

Cost Recovery Riders\n\n\n         ETI's two cost-recovery riders are based on forecasted data, in amounts unspecified at\nhearing, and to be updated through an annual true-up proceeding. Opponents of the program\nfocus on the prospective nature of these riders and ETI's inability to provide accurate or final\ncost figures. They argue that both riders should be rejected as piecemeal, premature, and not\nbased on costs that are known and measurable.              Opponents propose that any costs may be\ncaptured in a subsequent proceeding based on a historical test year once they are known and\n                48\nmeasurable.          They argue that allowable expenses are limited under PUC SUBST. R. 25.231(b) to\nexpenses that are reasonable and necessary to provide service.\n\n\n         ETI argues that the opponents' proposals to defer recovery of costs do not comply with\nPURA § 39.452(b)'s directive that rates be set in this proceeding to recover ETI's unrecovered\ncosts as a result of the CGS tariff. ETI also argues that deferral of cost recovery does not\nconstitute rate setting under Texas Supreme Court precedent. ETI points out that the Texas\nSupreme Court specifically rejected claims that deferred accounting should be considered as the\nsetting of rates. The court ruled that deferral of costs was no more than setting aside the costs, so\nthat a rate for their recovery could be considered in a future proceeding. 49\n\n\n        Under normal rate-making standards, the ALI would be inclined to agree with the\nopponents. However, the plain language of PURA § 39.452(b) requires that \"the utility's rates\nshall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as\na result of the implementation of the tariff,\" and the CGS tariff \"may not be considered to offer a\n\n\n        47   OPC Ex. 4 at 10.\n        48   TIEC Ex. 1 at 10.\n\n        49 State v.

The ALJ finds that the CGS legislation requires that the rate set in this matter\ninclude the recovery of any cost ETI reasonably anticipates incurring as a result of the CGS\nprogram, based on the Company's estimates, to be trued-up with actual costs in one year.\nHowever, opponents ofETl's proposal are correct that there may be benefits to non-participating\ncustomers or reduced costs to ETI, that should also be accounted for at the annual true-up\ncontemplated by both cost-recovery riders.\n\n\n         1.         CGSC Rider\n\n\n         Rider CGSC is designed to recover costs related to implementation and administration\ncosts incurred to support the CGS program. These costs would be recovered from all CGS\neligible (LIPS) customers through Rider CGSC, regardless of whether they actually take the\nCGS service. Because the costs are currently estimated, the CGSC Rider is set for an annual\ntrue-up to costs actually incurred. 52\n\n\n         While no party argues that ETI should not be able to recover its startup and\nadministration costs, the parties disagree with the timing and specifics of ETl's proposed CGSC\nRider.        Opponents argue PURA § 36.003 requires an electric utility's rates to be just and\nreasonable and that the utility has the burden to show its rate change is just and reasonable.\nThese parties contend that ETI failed to meet that burden, because it provided insufficient\nevidence of specific costs, opting instead for estimates. In other words there are currently no\ncosts upon which to base a rate and State witness Pevoto testified that estimates should not be\nused to establish rates in this proceeding. 53 As a result, the parties argue that Rider CGSC is\npremature and should be delayed until specific figures are available.\n\n\n         50   PURA § 39.452(b).\n         51   ETI Ex. 9 at PRM-1 at 7; Tr. at 20, 161, 175.\n         52   ETl Ex. 9 at 14,20.\n         53   State Ex. 1 at 41-42.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

The ALl notes that fuel reconciliations\noccur with regularity at the Commission and are analogous to the Company's proposed true-up\nmechanism for the        cas program.55       The ALl recommends that ETI recover in this proceeding,\nits estimated startup and administrative costs through Rider          casc, to be trued-up with actual\ncosts in one year.\n\n\n        TIEC and Staff also seek to limit the application of Rider       casc\n                                                                   to customers that elect to\nparticipate in the CGS program. 56 This argument has merit, because there is no discemable\nbenefit to the LIPS class customers who do not participate in the CGS program. As noted by\nStaff witness Stephen Mendoza, the rider \"would seem to go against a cost causation principle\nwhereby costs are allocated to those customers who cause the costs to be incurred.,,57\n\n\n       There is also the possibility that non-participating LIPS class manufacturers would suffer\na competitive disadvantage. PURA § 39.452(b) specifically requires that:\n\n       The commission shall ensure that a competitive generation tariff shall not be\n       implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of\n       manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.58\n\n\n\n       54   PURA § 39.452(b).\n       55   ETl Ex. 76 at 32.\n       56   Staff Ex. 3 at 12-13; TlEC Ex. 1 at 46-47.\n       57   Staff Ex. 3 at 12.\n       58   PURA § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

ETI witness Phillip May justified\nrecovering these costs from LIPS class customers who decide not to participate because \"those\ncustomers have the opportunity to sign up for and benefit from the CGS program.\"S9 But this\nargument ignores the plain language of PURA § 39.452(b) that prohibits competitive\ndisadvantage to those manufacturers who elect not to participate. The parameters of competitive\nharm, however, were not spelled-out in the provision, nor is there specific evidence in the record\nof such harm.\n\n\n       ETI also points out that limiting Rider CGSC to participants may result in the Company\nincurring the costs of implementation.       ETI witness May testified that, because there is a\npossibility that no customers will participate, the Company would be unable to recover its start-\nup and administrative costs if the rider is limited to CGS participants. 6o\n\n\n        This raises a potential conflict brought about by the language ofPURA § 39.452(b), and\nanother reason the ALJ recommends against implementation of the program. Nevertheless, if\nPURA § 39.452(b) is to be read in a manner to avoid conflict, the ALJ recommends that ETI has\nproposed a reasonable compromise. The ALJ agrees that requiring any non-participant in the\nCGS program to share in its costs violates the principle of cost causation. Yet, even Staff agrees\nthat PURA § 39.452(b) states the CGS tariffs \"may not be considered to offer a discount rate or\nrates under Section 36.007.\" PURA § 36.007(d) reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the commission shall ensure that\n       the electric utility's allocable costs of serving customers paying discounted rates\n       under this section are not borne by the utility's other customers.\n\nAs a result, Staff acknowledges the prohibition against \"other customers\" bearing the costs of a\ndiscounted rate appears not to apply here. Assuming this is the legislature's intent, ETI could\n\n\n       59   ETI Ex. 9 at 19,20.\n       60   ETI Ex. 76 at 32-33.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

What is clear, however, is that if Rider- CGSC applies\n only to participants and no entities participate, the Company would be left with unrecovered\nstartup costs, a result expressly prohibited by PURA § 39.452(b). If the Commission approves\nETI's proposal, the ALl supports limiting Rider CGSC to CGS participants.                             However, to\n address ETI's legitimate concern over the potential of being left with the costs, the ALl\nrecommends that Rider CGSC initially be implemented as proposed by ETI. However, once the\nprogram has participants, all costs should be shifted to those participants immediately or at the\nannual true-up.           A refund could be issued to non-participants concurrent with the cost\nreallocation. The ALl understands that this issue has not been fully explored, but ETI indicated\nin briefing that it is open to suggestions.\n\n\n          2.         CGSUSC Rider\n\n\n         Rider CGSUSC provides for the Company's recovery from non-participating customers\nof the embedded generation costs that it will lose from customers that elect to participate in the\nCGS program. It is intended to recover embedded generation costs and any other related base\nrate costs and would apply to all non-participating customers across all classes, including LIPS\ncustomers not participating in the CGS program. 61 As with Rider CGSC, the Company proposes\nan annual true-up of estimated unrecovered costs to the costs actually unrecovered. 62 ETI notes\nthe annual true-up will also provide an opportunity to consider potential adjustments in light of\nthe level of participation in CGS and its impact on other classes. 63\n\n\n\n\n         61    ETI Ex. 9 at 14, 15,21.\n         62    ETI Ex. 9 at 21-22.\n        63 ETI Ex. 9 at 23-24. While the Company has not proposed a cap on the level of CGS participation, it\nrecognized that this is a means oflimiting the exposure of non-participating classes to unrecovered costs.

XXX-XX-XXXX                  PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                       PAGE 22\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n       A number of parties argue that ETl is not entitled to recover embedded generation costs\nor other base rate costs at all. These parties contend that ETl is essentially seeking to recover\nlost revenues, not costs. Parties opposed to the rider argue no rate should be set in this case to\naccount for unrecovered costs.     Instead, such unrecovered costs should be recovered from\nincreased revenues from load growth, or from other savings that may be associated with the CGS\nprogram.\n\n\n\n       ETl argues these positions should be rejected because they are at odds with the\nrequirements of the governing statute and with fundamental rate setting principles. As argued by\nETI the \"unrecovered costs\" referenced in PURA § 39.452(b) and the \"lost revenue\" that ETI has\ncalculated as the measure of the unrecovered costs are one and the same in the ratesetting\ncontext. ETl points out that OPUC witness Johnson acknowledged in his direct testimony that\n\"[r]evenues are intended to equal embedded cost of service for the adjusted test year.,,64 TIEC\nwitness Pollock also agreed at hearing the Company's unrecovered revenues calculation would\naccount for the migrating customers' share of the Company's embedded fixed production costS. 65\n\n\n\n       The ALJ agrees with ETl that PURA § 39.452(b) requires that \"the utility's rates shall be\nset, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result\nof the implementation of the tariff,\" and that the CGS legislation specifically authorizes the\nCompany to recover any unrecovered costs as \"a result of' implementation of the CGS\nprogram. 66 ETI is entitled to collect unrecovered embedded generation costs and any other\nrelated base rate costs as a result of customer migration to the CGS program.\n\n\n\n       The ALJ agrees that ETI's revenue requirement is based on and designed to recover such\ncosts. With every customer that migrates to the CGS program, ETl loses a customer and suffers\n\"load loss.\" That is, the pool of customers contributing to the recovery of ETl's embedded\n\n\n       64   Tr. at 350-351.\n       6S   Tr. at 261-262,356.\n       66   ETI Ex. 76 at 28-29.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Load loss is detrimental to the\nCompany in the opposite manner that load growth benefits the Company. Additional customers\nmean the base rate quantum is spread over a larger pool. Furthermore, the same parties who\noppose Rider CGSUSC also contend ETl should offset the rider with load growth. Under normal\ncircumstances, the ALJ would agree with those parties opposed to COSUSC, because ETl is only\nentitled to seek, but is not guaranteed a set return on its investment.          However, PURA\n§ 39.452(b) mandates ETI recover \"any\" of its unrecovered costs as a result of the\nimplementation of the program.      Opponents of Rider COSUSC have failed to identify any\ncaveats to this expansive language. As a result, the ALJ concludes that ETl is entitled to recover\nthe unrecovered embedded generation costs and any related base rate costs as a result of\ncustomer migration to the COS program. As discussed below, however, that recovery should be\noffset against load growth and any identifiable capacity savings at the annual true-up.\n\n\n       The most troubling aspect of Rider COSUSC is that it recovers the unrecovered costs\nfrom all non-participating ratepayers. As with the arguments for and against Rider CGSC, Staff\nand a number of intervenors argue Rider COSUSC should be rejected because it is inconsistent\nwith the principal of cost-causation. Although the migrating COS customers cause the costs to\nbe incurred, Rider COSUSC recovers ETl's unrecovered embedded generation costs from all\nother ratepayers, including non-LIPS class customers who are not eligible to participate in the\nCOS program. 67\n\n\n       Furthermore, having non-COS participants pay for costs related to the COS program may\ncontradict the statutory requirement that the COS tariff not harm the \"sustainability or\ncompetitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation\"\nalthough there is no evidence on whether this might occur. 68 All of the arguments regarding\nRider CGSC's potential competitive harm to non-participating manufacturers apply with greater\nforce to Rider COSUSC. Not all manufacturing customers fall within the LIPS class. Due to the\n\n\n\n\n       67   Staff Ex. 3 at 12.\n       68   PURA § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

As a result, the prohibition against allocating costs to \"other ratepayers\" under\nPURA § 36.007 does not apply. However, Staff disagrees with BTl's conclusion that PURA\n§ 39.452(b) mandates these costs be recovered only from non-CGS participants. Staff argues\nthat nothing in PURA § 39.452(b), prevents BTl from charging the CGS participants its\nunrecovered costs. While the AU agrees with Staff, a primary point ofBTI's CGS program is to\nremove itself from the market exchange between CGS customer and the QF supplier.\nRecovering unrecovered capacity/base rate costs from the migrating customer runs counter to\nthis purpose.        Although, the AU agrees with BTl that recovering these costs from CGS\nparticipants would make the CGS program economically unattractive, PURA § 39.452(b) does\nnot mandate that such unrecovered costs be recovered from non-participating customers. 70 There\nis no easy resolution to this issue. Although the ALI provides further analysis below, Rider\nCGSUSC is a primary reason that he recommends the proposal be denied, because it runs\ncontrary to the fundamental ratemaking principle of cost causation and may harm the\ncompetitiveness of non-participating manufacturers.\n\n\n                   a.       Cost Estimates\n\n\n        One of the greatest concerns stated by opponents is that the amount of potentially\nunrecovered costs is unknown. BTl estimates that if all LIPS class customer were to contract for\nan alternative QF supply for 100 percent of their load, BTl could potentially realize 75.2 million\ndollars in avoided embedded generation costs for the eligible CGS load. Company witness May\ntestified that the Company already knows the unit cost of embedded generation that would be\navoided.      The only question is what the level of participation will be.           ETl cannot predict\n\n\n      69 PURA § 39.452(b)'s competitive language only applies to manufacturers who elect not to participate.\nThe AU acknowledges that non-LIPS class customers cannot participate.\n        70   ETI Ex. 76 at 32-33.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

However, Mr. Pollock\nadmitted these figures were based on 200 megawatts of participation, which was \"pulled out of\nthin air.,,73     The uncertainty associated with these figures is that the number of LIPS-class\ncustomers who will participate in the CGS program is unknown.\n\n\n        Because PURA § 36.003 requires that an electric utility's rates be just and reasonable, the\nelectric utility proposing a rate change has the burden of proof on that issue. Given that the\npotential costs of the CGS program are unknown and could be very substantial, opponents argue\nthat ETl has failed to show that Rider CGSUSC would result in just and reasonable rates. ETI\npoints out that the unrecovered costs will ultimately be trued-up. Opponents respond that the\ntrue-up will not occur until a year after the implementation of the program, resulting in\nratepayers being charged as much as 75 million dollars for the first year of the program. 74 They\nargue it is unreasonable for ratepayers to be charged a large, unsupported amount, especially\nwhen they do not cause ETl to incur these costs or benefit from the CGS program.\n\n\n         The ALJ agrees. The shifting of such unrecovered costs to rate-payers who do not cause\ntheir lack of recovery and the uncertainty associated with the ultimate amount to be charged\nother classes is another major reason for the ALl's recommended rejection of this program. This\nis not, however, a criticism of ETI. ETl was given the difficult task of developing a semi-\ncompetitive program for a limited number of customers, using its own distribution system and in\nspite of its limitations as a regulated entity and member of an integrated multi-state utility\n\n\n         71   ETI Ex. 9 at 14; Tr. at 157, 158, 162-163.\n         72   TIEe Ex. 1 at 51-52 and Ex.

The Company notes that while the portion of embedded\ngeneration costs subject to loss under the CGS program is known with certainty, the volume of\nload associated with those unrecovered costs will only be known once the program begins and\nparticipation levels are known. 7S All of these restrictions contributed to ETl's difficulty in\ndeveloping exact cost figures.\n\n\n        The AU finds that ETl has made a good faith effort to determine the unit cost of\nunrecovered embedded generation, but simply cannot predict the level of participation. In so\ndoing, ETl has given the Commission a worst-case scenario of 75 million dollars in unrecovered\ncosts if every eligible customer participates. Because a rate must be set in this proceeding, if the\nCommission approves ETl's CGS program, the ALJ recommends the rate be set based on ETl's\nprojections until the first annual true-up period, after which ETl may use known and measurable\ncosts to set rates in the future, taking into account load growth and other potential benefits of the\nprogram as discussed below.\n\n\n                   b.      Annual True-ups Should Account for Load Growth\n\n\n       Staff and opponents of Rider CGSUSC argue it is deficient because it fails to account for\nload growth, which could mitigate ETl's unrecovered generation-related costS. 76 TIEC witness\nPollock explained that as load grows:\n\n\n       each additional unit of energy sold will provide a contribution to all fixed costs\n       including embedded generation costs [and that] any reduction in embedded\n       generation cost recovery attributable to the CGS program [will] be more than\n       offset by increased revenues due to load growth. 77\n\nAlthough it remains to be see~ whether the reduction in cost recovery will be completely offset\nby load growth, it should nevertheless be accounted for. The potential amount of unrecovered\ncosts is substantial and ETl seeks to recover these costs from ratepayers who don't cause them\n\n       75   Tr. at 162.\n       76   Tr. at 372.\n       77   TIEe Ex. 1 at 50.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

As a result, opponents argue that any\npotential cost mitigation should be accounted for in designing Rider CGSUSC. The ALl agrees,\nand notes that at a minimum, load growth should be explored in the annual true-ups ofthe rider.\n\n\n         ETI points out that the unrecovered costs at issue here are the embedded test year\nproduction costs upon which the Company's base rates are being established. ETI explains that\nincremental changes in future costs and revenues do not play into the determination of how such\ncosts are recovered. 78 Instead, rates are set in the first instance to recover the historical cost of\nservice. Incremental future changes in revenue from load growth or future cost savings are\ndevoted to covering incremental future cost increases and to ensuring that shareholders still have\nan opportunity to earn a fair return despite these future increases. 79 The Company argues that its\napproach to unrecovered costs honors these fundamental rate setting principles: it preserves the\nCompany's opportunity to recover the existing embedded costs that its rates are set to recover,\nwhile the other parties' use of load growth and alleged future cost savings violates these\nprinciples.\n\n\n        ETI also notes that the Commission has previously recognized that load growth\nadjustments such as those suggested by opponents are inappropriate. Staff witness Mendoza, for\nexample, acknowledged the Commission's rejection of a base revenue/load growth adjustment in\nadopting its rule implementing the transmission cost recovery legislation codified in PURA\n§ 36.209. The Commission found that it was \"not necessary or appropriate\" to \"account for\ngrowth in overall revenue as a means to reduce the transmission costs eligible for recovery.... ,,80\nThe Commission found that such an adjustment would discourage utility investment and that the\nimpact of such load growth was more properly considered within the context of a future general\nrate setting proceeding. 8 !\n\n\n\n\n        78   Tr. at 356.\n        79   Tr. at 351-352.\n\n      80 Tr. at 358.

However, Rider CGSUSC recovers ETl's unrecovered base rate\ncosts as a result of load loss from all ratepayers who are not beneficiaries of the CGS program.\nThis violates the principal of cost causation. As a result, the ALJ recommends that load growth\nshould be accounted for to the extent that non-participating ratepayers are subsidizing CGS\nprogram participants.\n\n\n         ETl also argues that its costs are likely to increase cancelling out any load growth. ETl\nclaims that recent increases in non-fuel operating and maintenance costs have outpaced, and\nfuture forecast increases will continue to outpace, the Company's forecasted load growth due to\na number of factors. Company witness May explained that distribution costs, transmission costs,\nand generation costs have all increased at a greater rate than the increase in the Consumer Price\nIndex. ETI also argues that regulators' push for increased energy efficiency has reduced the rate\nof load growth increase. Increasing utility reliance on the maturing wholesale markets has\nchanged the traditional model of cost recovery to one where increased purchased capacity\nexpense must be captured through frequent rate case filings. 82 As a result, ETl claims that load\ngrowth cannot account for additional costs in the way it has in the past. Opponents generally\nargue that ETl's assumptions regarding its future costs lack evidentiary support or are unreliable.\nThe ALI finds that even if ETI is correct, cost increases affecting load growth is an issue that can\nbe addressed during the annual true-up proceeding.\n\n\n         ETl also cited the Commission's transmission cost recovery factor (TCRF) rule for\nutilities outside of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as support for not using\npotential load growth in designing Rider CGSUSC. 83 Staff argues, however, that the rule\naccounts for load growth, and protects ratepayers, because it requires the refund of any over-\nrecovery as a result of load growth, but prohibits the surcharge of any under-recovery.84 In its\n\n\n\n        82   ETI Ex. 76 at16; 202-205; Tr. at 192,201-206.\n        83   Tr. at 357-360.\n         84  Tr. at 357-360; P.D.C.

To do so would\n        undermine the underlying purpose of HB 989 to encourage timely investment in\n        non-ERCOT transmission infrastructure. 86\n\n\nStaff also notes that in the non-ERCOT TCRF rulemaking the Commission noted that non-\ntransmission costs could grow faster than the increased revenues resulting from the TCRF, which\nwas also an implicit recognition that the opposite could be true.\n\n\n        According to Staff, the TCRF rule is designed to encourage investment in non-ERCOT\ntransmission infrastructure.      The CGS program, however, should be designed neither to\nencourage nor discourage participation. Instead, Staff argues the program should be cost-based\nto the extent possible and contends that PURA § 39.452(b) expresses a policy against cross-\nsubsidization by prohibiting implementation in a manner that \"harms the sustainability or\ncompetitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.\"\nIn light of this legislative policy and the limited scope of eligible customers, inaccuracies in the\nallocation of costs should be resolved in favor of over-allocating costs to the program rather than\nunder-allocating costs to the program. Thus, Staff argues that accounting for load growth in the\nCGS program is appropriate.\n\n\n        ETI argues that if the Legislature had intended to include a load growth adjustment as\npart of a mechanism for cost recovery, it would have done so.

As Staff notes, PURA § 39.455 concerns the recovery of incremental\ncosts and the express recognition of incremental load (load growth) is logical in that context.\nPURA § 39.455 specifically references \"necessary costs of incremental resources required to\nmeet load requirements to the extent those costs result in the utility expending more for capacity\ncosts under purchase power agreements than were included in the utility's last base rate\ncase ... ,,88 In contrast, PURA § 39.452(b) lacks specificity about such cost recovery, using only\nthe term \"any\" in reference to costs.         If the vague term \"any\" is broad enough to include\nunrecovered base rate costs, as argued by ETI, then the ALJ finds that it should also be read as\ninclusive of traditional offsets to those costs, such as load growth.\n\n\n                 c.

Capacity Savings\n\n\n       Opponents of the CGS program argue that ETI failed to identify a number of potential\nbenefits for non-participating customers. TlEC provided substantial briefing on this issue and\nthe ALI's analysis focuses on its arguments among opponents.            TIEC points out that the\nCommission has long recognized that QF power may be used to avoid a utility's capacity and\nenergy costs. In Docket No. 5994, for example, the Commission held:\n\n       It is generally recognized that QF power may be used for two purposes. The first\n       purpose, which is the primary thrust of Section 201 of PURPA, is the\n       displacement of a utility's fuel with that of QFs to achieve a more efficient use of\n\n       87   PURA § 39.455 (emphasis added).\n       88   PURA § 39.455.\n\f SOAH DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                          PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                              PAGE 31\n PUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n          natural resources. The second purpose is the substitution of QF generating plant\n          for utility-constructed generating plant.   That is, rather than constructing\n          generating plant to serve its system demand, the utility should utilize, where\n          practical, the generating plant of QFs. 89\n\n\n TIEC argues the Commission's rules establish how avoided costs for QF capacity and energy\n should be addressed,90 and that the Commission has addressed how avoided costs may be\n determined for firm and as-available QF power and what constitutes firm or non-firm QF\n power. 91\n\n\n\n          First, TIEC argues that the CGS program would reduce ETI's capacity costs.                         It is\n undisputed that ETI is a capacity short company that pays capacity costs each month for\n purchased power and for its share of Entergy System capacity reserves. 92 According to ETI,\n purchased capacity costs, including capacity costs from its affiliates, were a significant\n component of the Company's cost of service and constituted 34 percent of the company's non-\n fuel revenue requirement.93 Even though ETI recently entered into several purchased power\n contracts, ETI's capacity deficit is expected to worsen over time and its load is growing at an\n                                        94\n estimated average rate of 1.8 percent. As a result, TIEC urges the Commission to deem CGS\npower as a firm source of generation, with the added benefit of reduced capacity costs for all of\nETI's customers.\n\n\n\n\n         89 Petition of Inquiry into the Rates Paid by Houston Lighting and Power Company to Qualifying Facilities\nfor the Purchase of Non-Firm Energy, Docket No. 5994, 12 Tex.

LIPS customers account for 23 percent of ETl's total\ndemand. 95 If demand-related costs could be reduced by moving firm LIPS customers to CGS\nload, the CGS program could possibly benefit all of ETl's customers through reduced MSS-l\ncosts and reduced capacity ETl currently procures in the market to serve LIPS customers. To\nrecognize these savings, however, ETl would have to treat the QF put as firm load - which it\ncannot. TIEC proposes a number of different ideas for achieving this. TIEC proposes that the\nOperating Company could recognize participating QFs as IPPs and enter into negotiated rates\nwith the QFS. 96 Capacity cost savings would result from a firm capacity contract with each QF,\n                                                                                                            97\nas demonstrated by EGSl's contract with Calpine's Carville facility, a QF located in Louisiana.\nHowever, the Commission does not have the authority to compel the Operating Committee to do\nso and ETI is subject to the Operating Committee's decisions on this issue.\n\n\n         TIEC also argues that a specific contract with ETl is not a pre-condition to treating QF\npower as capacity. TIEC posits the Commission could order ETl to recognize the capacity cost\nsavings resulting from a QF contract with a CGS customer. TIEC contends that FERC precedent\nand the System Agreement explicitly recognize that, if a state commission determines that\ncapacity costs can be avoided by QF purchases, that determination will affect the amount of\ncapacity deemed available for the operating company and will impact MSS-l reserve\nequalization payments under the System Agreement. 98 ETI and Staff respond that this authority\ndoes not apply to QF put from CGS suppliers, because it would not be within the utility's\ncontrol. As a result, ETI cannot recognize the capacity benefits of QF put. 99\n\n\n        TIEC claims there must be some avoided capacity costs by taking a steady stream of QF\npower. There is Commission authority for such recognition and the FERC has held that \"[s]tate\ncommission avoided cost determinations should be recognized for intra-system billing purposes\n\n\n        95   ETI Ex. 9 at 13.\n        96   Tr. at 88.\n        97   Tr. at 298; TIEC Ex. 11 at TIEC 9-9 EC1209.\n        98 Tr. at 86; TIEC Ex. 9, Entergy System Agreement at Section 10.02(f) and 2.12; State ofArk. v Middle\nSouth Servs., Inc., 34 FERC ~ 61342,61639, Opinion No. 246-A (March 17, 1986) (affrrming Opinion No. 246, 33\nFERC ~ 61408 (Dec. 23, 1985).\n        99   Tr. at 87.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

According to TIEC, the Commission has the jurisdictional authority to\ndetermine whether the power put to ETI by a QF as a result of a CGS customer's contract with\nthe QF results in firm capacity, 101 is evidence of the utility's legally enforceable obligation to\ntake that power,102 and creates avoided costs associated with the power. 103\n\n\n         TIEC acknowledges, however, that Commission rules differentiate capacity and energy\nbenefits provided by QFs based on whether the power is firm or non-firm. In Docket No. 5994,\nthe Commission determined that \"[t]he difference between firm and nonfirm primarily is the\nexistence or non-existence of a legally enforceable obligation on the behalf of the QF to provide\npower.,,104 P.u.e.

TIEC argues that ETI would experience\noperational savings due to a flatter round-the-clock load shape. As a result, ETI could eliminate\na sporadic PURPA put pattern and would not have to swing generation associated with QFs as\nmuch. TIEC argues that this would reduce the amount of capacity needed to maintain reliable\nservice. I 12\n\n\n         The obvious problem with TIEC's arguments is that they are premature. For instance,\nthere is no evidence on any of the factors to determine whether OF put is firm because the\nprogram has yet to be approved, implemented, or subscribed to. Until that happens there are no\ncontracts to be examined, nor capacity savings to be explored. In short, the record did not\nindicate whether there would actually be any capacity benefit. I 13 Mr. Pollock admitted that QF\nput does not count as capacity in ETl's resource planning, that such savings are only a potential\nbenefit, and that there has been no specific quantification of potential savings from reduced\ncapacity costS.11 4 As for operational costs, there is no evidence on load shape or decreased\nvolatility in QF put power.\n\n\n         Furthermore, as argued by Staff and ETI, Mr. Pollock acknowledged that QF put is a\nnon-finn source of energy. 115 He also acknowledged that his theory of capacity savings was\ndependent on an assumption that the QF put from which cas customers will be supplied is\ntreated as a firm resource. 116 Both Staff and ETI argue that QF put cannot be treated a finn\nsupply. First, with regards to any contract between a cas supplier and customer, the Company\nwould be a third party to the contract with no rights whatsoever stemming from that contract.\nThe fact that a cas customer might contract with a cas supplier for a \"firm\" supply of power,\ndoes not change the fact that ETI would have no control over the power put by the QF to ETI --\nthat power would still be non-firm to ETI.

The Company's obligation to provide continuous, reliable service to all of its\ncustomers, including those that migrate to CGS, would remain unchanged; CGS customers must\nreceive firm service and ETI cannot plan its system any differently regardless of customer\ntype. 117 As a result, Staff and ETI argue that capacity cost savings are unlikely.\n\n\n       Staff and ETI also argue that TIEC's reliance on P.D.C. SUB ST. R. 25.242's definition of\n\"firm power\" is misplaced. The definition of \"firm power\" in the rule states: \"from a qualifying\nfacility, power or power-producing capacity that is available pursuant to a legally enforceable\nobligation for scheduled availability over a specified term.,,118 Again, the contract between the\nQF and the CGS customer is irrelevant. The purpose of the rule is \"to regulate arrangements\nbetween qualifying facilities, retail electric providers with the price to beat obligation (PTB\nREPs), and electric utilities.,,119 The rule only applies to \"all PTB REPs and to all electric\nutilities.,,120 A CGS customer is not one of these entities, and is not subject to the rule even ifit\nenters into a contract with a QF subject to the rule. The ALJ agrees with Staff and ETI. A\ncontract between a CGS customer and a QF is not subject to the rule and cannot serve as the\nbasis for finding a \"legally enforceable obligation\" between the QF and ETI to satisfy the\ndefinition of \"firm power.\"\n\n\n       At this point, the ALJ agrees with Staff and ETI that the Company cannot, nor should the\nCommission treat, CGS QF put as firm capacity. However, as noted by Mr. Pollock, because a\nCGS customer will need firm, reliable service, it is reasonable to anticipate they will enter into\ncontracts with QF suppliers for firm round-the-clock power. As a result, the ALJ anticipates (as\ndo most intervenors) that ETI's purchased capacity and MSS-l needs will drop in some\nproportion to the number of LIPS customers who migrate to the CGS program. If all non-\nparticipating ETI customers are to make up for ETI's resulting load loss, then they should also\nrealize the benefit of any capacity savings. If the Commission approves the CGS program, the\n\n\n       117   Tr. at 52, 124, 125, 136-137.\n       118   P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.242(c)(5).\n       119   P .U.c. SUBST.

Potential Average Fuel Cost Savings\n\n\n         Opponents also argue that the CGS program has the potential to lower average fuel costs\nfor non-CGS participants. ETl's proposal contemplates that CGS customers will move off the\nfuel factor and instead pay energy costs at the avoided cost rate. ETl's firm customers (LIPS,\nresidential, commercial) are on ETl's fuel factor and pay average fuel costs, as opposed to\navoided fuel costs. During the reconciliation period, ETl's avoided costs of QF energy were\nhigher than its average costs of energy. As a result, these parties contend that if firm LIPS load\nhad moved to the CGS tariff during the reconciliation period, average fuel costs would have\nlowered for non-CGS participants. 121\n\n\n         ETI argues that avoided fuel costs could actually be lower than average fuel costs, but no\nparty other than TIEC provided analysis of this likelihood. In fact, both Cities witness Karl\nNalepa and ETI witness John Hurstell confirmed that, when avoided costs are higher than\naverage costs, non-CGS customers would experience lower average fuel costs; and that they had\nconducted no analysis comparing ETl's average and avoided fuel costs. I22 While there could be\ncertain times when avoided fuel costs are lower than average fuel costs, TlEC argues that\nincreases in gas prices make this scenario less likely. 123\n\n\n\n\n          121 Tr. at 229-230,311.

Staff is also\nconcerned that because potential unrecovered generation costs could be substantial, any benefits\nwould probably be inadequate to offset those costs. Staff is correct that it is premature to attempt\nto weigh the relative value of such benefits - there is no evidence on the matter. Nevertheless, in\nthe event the Commission approves ETI's CGS proposal, the ALl recommends that a review of\naverage fuel cost saving should at least be included in the annual true-up proceeding.\n\n\nc.      ETI May Recover its Costs Through a Rider\n\n\n        Cities argue that PURA § 39.452(b) limits ETI's recovery of unrecovered costs to\nprogram implementation and administration costs (CGSC costs) and prohibits recovery of\nunrecovered costs through a rider. Cities cite to the legislative history of PURA § 39.452(b),\nspecifically the Bill Analysis filed with the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 1567, to\nsupport both arguments. 125 The portion of the Bill Analysis Cities rely on states:\n\n        At the time the utility files a rate proceeding, a competitive generation tariff must\n        be proposed that the PUC shall approve, reject or modify. Any tariff that is\n        approved cannot be considered as a discounted rate and the utility's rates shall be\n        set in this proceeding to recover any costs associated with the tariff. When the\n        utility files a rate proceeding, they cannot request approval of both a rate change\n        and a rate rider mechanism.\n\nThe ALJ rejects the idea that ETI is limited to recovering CGSC costs. The language of PURA\n§ 39.452(b) imposes no such restrictions, and clearly states ETI is entitled \"to recover any costs\nunrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\"\n\n\n        Staff and ETl also disagree with Cities' interpretation ofPURA 39.452(b) stating that the\nCGS tariffs \"may not be considered to offer a discounted rates or rates under Section 36.007.\"\nCities argue that the reference to PURA § 36.007 means that ETl must recover its cost of\nproviding service to CGS customers since to recover less than its cost would mean that it would\n\n\n\n        124   Tr. at 251.\n        125   Cities Initial Brief at 13.\n\f SOAH DOCKET NO.

Cities\n do not explain why a statutory requirement that ETI recover its costs means that it is prohibited\n from recovering those costs from other ratepayers.\n\n\n          Staff argues that Section 39.452(b)'s reference to Section 36.007 means the prohibition\n against recovering costs associated with a discounted rate from other ratepayers does not apply to\n the CGS tariff and that therefore ETI can recover its unrecovered costs from other ratepayers so\n                   . . approves such a recovery. 127\n 1ong as th e CommlSSlon\n\n\n          Finally, Staff notes that Cities' argument that PURA § 39.452(b) only allows ETl to\n recover its unrecovered costs through base rates, raises another issue. Both riders include an\n annual true-up mechanism, which Staff is concerned may be retroactive ratemaking not\n                               128\n authorized by PURA.                 The Commission is currently considering a proposed rule under which\n utilities may reconcile their distribution costs of service. 129 As a result, Staff requests that the\n Commission consider resolving the retroactive ratemaking issue consistently in this docket and\n that rulemaking.\n\n\nD.       The Unserved Energy Rate\n\n\n         ETI proposes that in instances where the QF is either unable or chooses not to put energy\nto ETI, the CGS customer will take energy from ETI at the Unserved Energy rate. The proposed\nUnserved Energy rate is based on a fixed heat rate and objective market gas prices. ETl argues\nthat this approach gives the CGS customer certainty as to pricing so it can either contract for\nsuch risk with the QF or hedge that risk. ETl also asserts that the rate involves a sufficiently\n\n\n\n         126   Cities Initial Brief at 15-16.\n         127   Staff's Initial Brief at 4.\n\n        128 See Project No. 38298, Initial Comments of the Steering Committee of Cities Served by Dncor (July\n26,2010), at 16.\n\n         129 Rulemaking Related to Recovery by Electric Utilities ofDistribution Costs, Project No. 38298, Proposal\nfor Publication of New § 25.43 as Approved at the June 11,2010 Open Meeting (June 14,2010) at Section (d).\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

TIEC contends\nthat SMS and CGS customers are indistinguishable. l3l ETI first responds that this claim is based\non the false assumption that the Company is being supplied firm energy and capacity directly\nfrom the QF. As explained above, CGS QF put cannot be considered firm energy. ETI also\nargues that TIEC's proposal fails to recognize substantive differences between SMS and the role\nof the Unserved Energy rate. The Unserved Energy rate is not designed to function as back-up\npower as with customers that contract with ETI under SMS. Customers under the SMS tariff\nown their own generation, contract for SMS capacity, and in turn may rely on that capacity and\npurchase energy when their own generation becomes unavailable. 132 SMS customers may not\nresell any power taken under the SMS tariff. Furthermore, unlike the SMS tariff, there is no\nrequirement that CGS customers own their own generation, and many will not. 133\nConsequently, many potential CGS customers would not be eligible to participate in the CGS\ntariff if the SMS tariff were read into the CGS requirements. CGS and SMS customers are not\nindistinguishable.\n\n\n       Next, ETI argues that the energy rate charged to CGS customers and under the SMS tariff\nis based on the avoided costs determined after the fact for SMS. 134 ETI explains that, if the SMS\nrate were the recourse rate under CGS, the CGS customer would have no certainty before the\nfact of its risk exposure for a failure of the QF to put energy to ETI. This would complicate the\nCGS customers' ability to mitigate that risk. That said, there is little risk to address because the\nenergy rates are effectively the same for CGS service and SMS. TIEC's proposal seriously\nundermines its assertions that CGS customers and QFs could effectively firm up QF put energy\n\n\n       130   ETI Ex. 52 at 45-46.\n       131   TIEC Ex. 1 at 44.\n       132   Tr. at 124; ETI Ex. 73 at 17.\n       133   ETI Ex. 73 at 17-18.\n       134   The SMS tariff provides for an avoided cost rate plus an adder.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

There is little incentive for a CGS customer to\npay a premium for delivery assurance if the customer will pay approximately the same energy\nrate for CGS supply as it would pay for the energy that the Company provides when that\ncustomer's QF supply option is unavailable. The CGS customer would be relatively indifferent\nto the source of energy supply. TIEC's proposal for replacing Unserved Energy with the SMS\nrate is flawed as it does nothing more than offer the CGS customer neutral pricing options in lieu\nof alternative supply options.\n\n\n       TIEC and OPUC expressed the concern that the Unserved Energy rate will allow the\nCompany to realize additional profit. 135 ETI responds that any revenues obtained through\napplication of the Company's Unserved Energy component will be returned to all customers\nthrough the Company's fixed fuel factor (including LIPS customers as to the portion of load not\ndesignated for CGS service) as a credit to the fuel balance. 136\n\n\n       Finally, ETI argues that under TlEC's proposal, QF put would be deemed avoided\ncapacity for MSS-I purposes, purchased by ETI at its avoided capacity costs, and then purchased\nfrom ETI by CGS customers at avoided energy costs. In other words, the QF put would be\nrecognized as avoided capacity when doing so would result in MSS-l savings, but then priced as\navoided energy when it comes time for CGS customers to purchase such put from ETI.            The\nALJ agrees that TIEC's proposal on Unserved Energy should be rejected.\n\n\n                                             VI. CONCLUSION\n\n\n       PURA § 39.452(b) authorizes the Commission to accept, reject, or modify the\nCompany's proposed CGS tariff. The ALJ finds that ETl's proposal represents a good faith\neffort to develop a CGS program that does not violate the System Agreement and yet complies\nwith PURA § 39.452(b). The ALJ recommends the Commission reject the proposal, however,\nbecause it shifts a significant cost burden to ratepayers who either cannot or elect not to\nparticipate.

Furthermore, the costs cannot be accurately quantified\nuntil the program has been implemented and the number of participants known - thus\nnecessitating two cost-recovery riders and an annual true-up.        ETl recognizes the policy\nimplications of such cost-shifting and made this appeal to the Commission:\n\n       ETI realizes that the cost shifting associated with the CGS program raises\n       important policy concerns. If such concerns cause the Commission to conclude\n       that the CGS program as proposed should not be adopted, the proper course of\n       action is to reject the program as allowed by the statute, rather than modify the\n       program in a way that would require shareholders to fund unrecovered costs. 138\n\nThe ALJ agrees and recommends that ETl's proposed CGS program be rejected. The proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are limited to the CGS issue as the parties have already\nprovided the remaining proposed findings and conclusions in the Stipulation and Settlement\nAgreement and Proposed Final Order.\n\n\n             VII. PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n\nA.     Findings of Fact on ETl's CGS Proposal\n\n\n1.     As part of its application, ETl proposed a Competitive Generation Service (CGS)\n       pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. (PURA) § 39.452(b).\n\n2.     On July 16, 2010 and July 20, 2010, a SOAR Administrative Law Judge held a hearing\n       on the merits on ETl's CGS Proposal.\n\n3.     ETl's proposed CGS tariff provides eligible customers with the opportunity to have ETI\n       purchase competitive generation selected by the CGS customer and provide the selected\n       generation at retail to the CGS customer.\n\n4.     The eligible customers are Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS) customers under the\n       proposal.\n\n5.    Under the proposed tariff, a CGS customer would have the ability to contract with a\n      participating CGS supplier, an eligible Qualifying Facility (QF), that puts energy to ETl\n      for a set amount of load at an agreed upon price.\n\n       137\n                  PURA § 39.452(b).\n      138    ETl Initial Brief at 9.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                      PAGE 43\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n6.    The CGS customer must designate what portion of its load will be served by its CGS\n      supplier under the CGS tariff and what portion will be served under the applicable LIPS\n      tariff rate.\n\n7.    So long as the CGS supplier provides the energy contracted for by the CGS buyer, BTl\n      will continue to purchase energy from the QF at the avoided cost rate and the CGS\n      customer will pay BTl the avoided cost rate for the level contracted for in place of all\n      generation relate~ components that would otherwise be billed under the LIPS tariff.\n\n8.    A CGS customer and a QF supplier are free to contract, without ETl's participation, for a\n      price other than avoided costs, in which case, the costs above or below the avoided costs\n      would be accounted for in payments between the CGS customer and CGS supplier, as\n      prescribed by the contract.\n\n9.     The proposed tariff would consist of a schedule describing the provisions of the program\n       (Schedule CGS) along with two cost recovery riders associated with the proposed\n       program: the Competitive Generation Service Cost rider (Rider CGSC) and the\n       Competitive Generation Service Unrecovered Service Cost rider (Rider CGSUSC).\n\n10.    Rider CGSC is designed to recover costs related to implementation and operating costs\n       incurred to support the CGS program. These costs would be recovered from all CGS\n       eligible customers (LIPS) customers through Rider CGSC regardless of whether they\n       actually take the CGS service.\n\n11.    Rider CGSC would recover ETl's initial and ongoing program costs from ratepayers who\n       would not cause those costs to be incurred.\n\n12.    Rider CGSC would recover costs from ratepayers who do not participate in the CGS\n       program.\n\n13.    The amount of implementation and operating costs incurred to support the CGS program\n       to be recovered through Rider CGSC cannot be ascertained until after the program is\n       implemented and CGS customers participate.\n\n14.    Rider CGSUSC is designed to recover the difference between what would have been\n       billed by BTl under traditional LIPS service and what is billed under the combined CGS\n       tariff and modified LIPS service.\n\n15.    The amount of unrecovered embedded generation costs and any other related base rate\n       costs to be recovered under Rider CGSUSC cannot be ascertained until after the program\n       is implemented and CGS customers participate in the program.\n\n16.    Rider CGSUSC would recover embedded generation costs and any other related base. rate\n       costs and would apply to all non-participating customers across all classes, including\n       LIPS customers not participating in the CGS program.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Rider CGSUSC would recover ETl's unrecovered embedded generation costs from\n      ratepayers who would not cause those costs to be incurred.\n\n18.   Rider CGSUSC would recover costs from ratepayers who do not participate in the CGS\n      program.\n\n19.   Rider CGSC and Rider CGSUSC may harm the competitiveness of manufacturers that\n      choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.\n\n20.   The power put to ETl would have no effect on ETl's generation resource planning\n      because the energy put to ETl by a QF is a non-firm resource.\n\n21.   There has not been a quantification of the alleged benefits to non-CGS customers that\n      would result from potential capacity savings, reduced average fuel costs, and additional\n      revenues from the Unserved Energy Rate.\n\n22.   Rider CGSUSC is deficient because it does not account for potential load growth. Load\n      growth should be accounted for because load growth could mitigate ETl's unrecovered\n      generation related costs.\n\n\nB.    Conclusions of Law on ETl's CGS Proposal\n\n\n1.    PURA § 39.452(b) permits ETl to charge its unrecovered initial and ongoing program\n      costs and generation related costs to customers who do not participate in the CGS\n      program.\n\n2.    ETl cannot be required to absorb its unrecovered costs under PURA § 39.452(b).\n\n3.    PURA § 39.452(b) does not prohibit ETl from charging CGS participants its unrecovered\n      costs.\n\n4.    PURA § 39.452(b) requires that the Commission \"approve, reject, or modify\" the CGS\n      tariff proposed by BTL\n\n5.    PURA § 39.452(b) permits ETl to account for load growth in the design of the CGS\n      tariff.\n\n6.    ETl has not met its burden of proof to establish a rate regarding the unrecovered cost of\n      implementing the CGS program.\n\n7.    The term \"eligible customer\" in PURA § 39.452(b) does not mandate that the CGS\n      program be only available to LIPS class customers.\n\n8.    P.U.C. SUBST.

AVAILABILITY\n\n                 Pursuant to PURA Section 39.452(b), this competitive generation tariff allows eligible\n                 Entergy Texas, Inc. (\"ETI\" or \"Company\") customers the ability to contract for competitive\n                 generation. This Rider will be available to Rate Schedules Large Industrial Power Service\n                 (\"LIPS\") and Large Industrial Power Service - Time of Day (\"LIPS-TOD\") firm customer\n                 load.\n\n          II.    APPLICABILITY\n\n                 Customers receiving service under Rate Schedules LIPS and LIPS-TOD may contract with           N\n                 Qualifying Facilities (\"QF(sn that are able to put energy to ETI for the provision of energy\n                 to serve all or part of the Customer's generation requirements. Such customers will pay\n                 only CGS charges on Schedule LIPS or Schedule LIPS-TOD (Net Monthly Bill, Column B)\n(                plus applicable adjustments for the load served on CGS. Eligible Customers who elect to\n                 serve a portion of their load with CGS are CGS Customers.\n\n          Ill.   REQUIREMENTS\n\n                 A. Any Customer applying for CGS must receive service under one of the Rate Schedules\n                    listed in § II above. Only the service provided under such Schedules is eligible for\n                    CGS.\n                 B. A LIPS customer participating in the CGS program as a QF at one account location\n                    may not also participate as a CGS customer at that same account location.\n                 C. CGS Customers must inform the Company at the time of sign-up of their MW block\n                    commitment for CGS for the initial term.         CGS Customers may change that\n                    commitment with their next term of service.\n                 D. Any Customer accepted for CGS service must be billed on a calendar month basis.\n                 E. CGS service may only begin after technical and contractual requirements are met\n                    (amended contract with the utility and back up metering/telemetry in place).\n                 F. Standby and Maintenance Service (\"SMS\") is not available to CGS Customers.\n\n\n          IV.    INITIAL TERM\n\n                 The initial term will begin January 1, 2011 and be effective for one year. CGS Customers\n                 must notify ETI in writing a minimum of 60 days before beginning CGS and must have all\n                 contractual and technical requirements completed prior to taking CGS. CGS Customers\n                 may start service anytime after January 1, 2011 but must commit to a full one year period\n                 from their beginning date. CGS may then be renewed on an annual basis with the\n                 minimum 60 day notification period. After the initial term, ETI will provide a report to the\n                 Public Utility Commission of Texas identifying the successes as well as issues raised by\n\n\n\n                                              (Continued on reverse side)\n\n\n\n\n    2009 ETI Rate Case                                                                          3-333\n\f                                                                                        Exhibit PRM-1\n                                                                                   2009 TX Rate Case\n                                                                                          Page 2 of7\n\n                                                                                            Page42.2\n            CGS. The report will also identify any changes that should be considered as a result of the\n            first year of implementation and may result in changes to this Rider. CGS Customers\n            assume the risk that changes to this Rider may affect the economics of any contract\n            between a CGS Customer and a QF.\n\n      V.    RETURN TO BUNDLED SERVICE\n\n            CGS Customers may choose to withdraw from their one year commitment to CGS at\n            anytime during that year but must give a 60 day written notice prior to returning to bundled\n            service. A CGS Customer choosing to withdraw may not return to CGS for at least 12\n            months from the time the withdrawal is effective.\n                                                                                                           N\n      VI.   NET MONTHLY BILL\n\n            CGS customers will be billed for CGS pursuant to § II. In addition to these charges CGS\n            Customers will also be billed the Company's Hourly Avoided Cost calculated pursuant to\n            Attachment A of Rate Schedule LQF paid to the QF(s) to provide the CGS Customer's\n            energy. Should any hourly deficiencies occur between the Customer's committed CGS\n            load and the QF generation delivery within that hour, CGS Customers will be billed for\n            \"Unserved CGS Energy'' and be charged using the formula below:\n\n            Gas price based on a 13,000 Btu/kWh heat rate (on-peak) and 10,000 Btu/kWh heat rate\n            (off-peak) applied to a gas price pursuant to the Houston Ship Channel Gas Daily Average\n            (HSCGDA) plus a delivery adder based on Entergy's historical average cost per MMBtu of\n            gas delivered to ETl's Lewis Creek and Sabine plants for the preceding 24 months ending\n            October 31. The delivery adder will be updated annually. On-peak and off-peak are as\n            defined by Platt's Megwatt Daily.\n\n      IX.   METERING\n\n            Interval data recording (IDR) meters and telemetry are required for billing CGS accounts.\n            Back up meters, the incremental cost of which will be paid by the Customer, are also\n            required. The CGS Customer will be responsible for the cost of telephone service and\n            maintaining any required telephone equipment for the IDR. Alternatively, and at ETl's\n            discretion, such telemetry communications service required for billing may be provided to\n            the CGS Customer in accordance with ETI Rider Schedule RCL (Remote Communications\n            Link Rider).

PURPOSE\n\n                   This Competitive Generation Service Unrecovered Service Cost Rider rRider CGSUSC\"\n                   or \"Rider\") defines the procedure by which Entergy Texas, Inc. (\"Company\") shall\n                   implement and adjust rates for recovery of lost base rate revenue resulting from\n                   customers participating in the Company's Competitive Generation Service (\"CGS\n                   Program\"). The purpose of this Rider is to provide a mechanism for recovery of such lost\n                   base rate revenues that were included in the Company's last general rate case\n                   proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Texas (\"PUCr).\n                                                                                                                N\n          II.      APPLICABILITY\n\n                   This Rider is applicable under the regular terms and conditions of the Company to all\n                   electric service billed under the Company's rate schedules subject to the jurisdiction of\n                   the PUCT, with the exception of service billed under the CGS Program provisions of Rate\n                   Schedules LIPS and UPS-TOD.\n\n          Ill.     RATE PROCEDURE\n\n                   The rates shown on Attachment A to this Rider shall be updated annually on or before\n                   October 1st to reflect the estimated lost base rate revenue for (1) customers and load\n                   participating in the Company's CGS Program in the upcoming calendar year and (2) a\n                   true-up calculation for the twelve (12) billing months ending with December 31st of the\n                   prior year. The estimate of the tost base rate revenue for the upcoming calendar year will\n                   be based on the usage history for the known participants at the time of filing. The\n                   Company will calculate the base rate charges that would apply under the standard rates\n                   for the annual usage of customers participating in the CGS Program. This standard rate\n                   amount will be compared to the rate revenue calculated under the applicable CGS\n                   Program rates actually in effect for the Program participants. The difference between\n                   these two amounts is the CGS Program's annual estimated lost base rate revenue.\n\n                   The true-up calculation is the difference between the calculated standard (non-CGS\n                   Program) rate charges for actual usage in the CGS Program and the actual CGS\n                   Program rate revenue for all participants in the twelve {12) billing months ending with\n                   December 31stof the prior year, plus interest calculated monthly on accrued true-up\n                   balances using the rate established annually by the PUCT for overbilling and certain\n                   underbilling in the P.U.C. Suesr. R. 25.28(c) and (d). Interest shall be calculated based\n                   on the principles set out in the P.U.C. Suesr. R. 25.236(e){1 ). The sum of the upcoming\n                   year estimate and the true-up calculation is the amount allocated to the rate classes\n                   using the Production Demand Allocation Factors from the most recent base-rate case\n                   adjusted to remove CGS Program load and energy. The resulting rate class allocations\n                   of lost base rate revenue will be used to calculate rate class charges using the\n\n\n                                              (Continued on reverse side)\n\n\n\n\n    2009 ETI Rate Case                                                                          3-337\n\f                                                                                           Exhibit PRM-1\n                                                                                      2009 TX Rate Case\n                                                                                             Page 6 of7\n\n                                                                                       Page44.2\n             Company's best estimate of Mure billing determinants as adjusted to remove expected\n             CGS Program load and energy.\n\n             The initial Rider CGSUSC Rate Adjustments shall become effective with the first (1st)\n             billing cycle of the month following the date of the PUCT order approving this Rider\n             CGSUSC if such order is received by the fifth (5th) day of the month, otherwise, the initial\n             Rider CGSUSC Rate Adjustments shall become effective with the first (1st) billing cycle\n             of the second (2nd) subsequent month after the date of the PUCT order approving this\n             Rider CGSUSC and shall remain in effect until superseded.

MACK:\n\n 3          Q      How are you doing, Mr. May?\n\n 4          A      Doing good.\n\n 5          Q      Good.   Could you tell me what an interval\n\n 6   data recording meter is?\n\n 7          A       It's a meter that records the actual usage by\n\n 8   a customer and frequent intervals, perhaps as frequent\n\n 9   as you want, 15-minute intervals, that sort of thing,\n\n10   so it provides for an average month.          Instead of just\n\n11   cumulative consumption,        it would provide that actual\n\n12   consumption on a 15-minute basis.\n\n13          Q      And you claim that those would be necessary\n\n14   for a CGS customer.         Is that right?\n\n15          A       Correct.\n\n16          Q      And why is that?\n\n17          A       So that you can match up what the actual QF\n\n18   Put is to what the consumption is at that CGS\n\n19   customer.       And so that -- make sure that the unserved\n\n20   energy that Mr. Hurstell was talking about, that would\n\n21   provide whether or not there was a need to provide the\n\n22   gap,       if you will, with unserved energy.\n\n23          Q      Okay.   And is that kilowatts, or kilowatt\n\n24   hours?\n\n25          A       It would be kilowatts per hour.    Probably\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 l~b\n\n\n               PUC: 37744 SOAR: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                VOLUME 3\n\n 1   match it up on an hourly basis.\n\n 2       Q     Okay.     And if there were a customer that had\n\n 3   a permanent and steady load, would they still need one\n\n 4   of these meters?\n\n 5       A     Absolutely.\n\n 6       Q     And why is that?\n\n 7       A     Because I don't think there is a permanent\n\n 8   steady load.      That load would fluctuate, and we would\n\n 9   need to make sure we know exactly what that load is\n\n10   and can match it up on an hour-by-hour basis with that\n\n11   QF Put.\n\n12       Q     Okay.\n\n13                     MR.

KELLEY:\n\n17       Q     Yes, I have a few questions, Mr. May.\n\n18       A     All right.\n\n19       Q     Since this legislation was being considered\n\n20   sometime, I would imagine, before the last legislative\n\n21   session up until today, what discussions has the\n\n22   company had with any of its LIPS customers to gauge\n\n23   the level of interest in the CGS program?\n\n24       A     What discussion have we had with our LIPS\n\n25   customers?\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAR: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1         Q    Right.\n\n 2         A    We had a couple of discussions, and I won't\n\n 3   be able to recall all the details.          There were -- I\n\n 4   believe there were at least two.\n\n 5                      The one that I am thinking of\n\n 6   specifically here, where we talked about some of the\n\n 7   issues associated, that was about a year ago.          It was\n\n 8   after the legislative session.       We talked about some\n\n 9   of the provisions of the CGS within the law.          We\n\n10   described what we saw as some of the challenges of\n\n11   making sure that the CGS complied with the system\n\n12   agreement.       And as a matter of fact,    in that meeting,\n\n13   one of those LIPS customers suggested using QF as a\n\n14   means for getting around that.\n\n15         Q    As a percentage of your LIPS customers, did\n\n16   you       have you come away from any of these\n\n17   discussions with a feel for what the level of\n\n18   participation would be?\n\n19         A    No.     And having that discussion, I think\n\n20   there was indication of interest, but, you know, it's\n\n21   one of those things where it's all in the details and\n\n22   relevant marketing conditions at the time and so\n\n23   forth.     So I could not tell you how -- which customers\n\n24   and how many and how much would be interested in\n\n25   actually partaking in the CGS.\n\n                       KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                 512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 1~8\n\n              PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                               VOLUME 3\n\n 1       Q    Okay.     Just no idea if it would be 5 percent\n\n 2   of your customers or 100 percent of your customers?\n\n 3       A    Have no way of estimating it.\n\n 4       Q    Okay.     If you could turn to Page 15 of\n\n 5   your -- oh, 19 of your testimony --\n\n 6       A    Direct?\n\n 7       Q     -- sir, and you talk about the CGSC Rider and\n\n 8   what the company estimates for startup and ongoing\n\n 9   costs.\n\n10       A    Yes, ma'am.\n\n11       Q    And I notice on Lines No. 15 and 16, you talk\n\n12   about that the precise level of ongoing cost in each\n\n13   of these areas would be dependent upon level of\n\n14   participation.     Correct?\n\n15       A    Yes, ma'am.\n\n16       Q    But what did -- what level of participation\n\n17   did you use to come up with the estimates for the\n\n18   kick-off costs and the yearly cost?\n\n19       A    I think what we talked about is a level that\n\n20   was well below the entirety of the LIPS class but at a\n\n21   level that could be managed with sort of an\n\n22   out-of-the-process process.     We have a billing process\n\n23   that is fairly automated.     What we would plan to do\n\n24   with this would be to do these by hand, so to speak,\n\n25   and it was our view that we could manage a significant\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1   participation in this with these two-and-a-half\n 2   full-time customers on an ongoing basis.         So a\n 3   significant portion of the customers could be managed\n 4   with that.\n 5          Q    Okay.    But you must have had some starting\n 6   estimate.     I think I heard you say you were trying to\n 7   come up with a ballpark or          there must -- it's not\n\n 8   plucked out of thin air.        You grant me that, don't\n 9   you?\n10          A    I'm sorry.     I didn't hear all that.\n11          Q    The $610,000 figure and then the 330\n12          A    Yes, ma'am.\n\n13          Q    -- that's not just plucked out of thin air.\n14   Correct?\n15          A    No, ma'am.\n16          Q    Okay.    So what -- I think I heard you say\n17   that there was some assumption about the level of\n18   participation there would be, and I'd ask you to kind\n19   of give me a ballpark there.\n\n20          A    Yes.    And let me make clear, I don't think we\n21   had any assumption of what the actually participation\n22   would be.     What we were doing was trying to design a\n23   system in which we would have the capacity to deal\n24   with a significant portion of the LIPS customers\n25   participating.\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                                                                  .LbU\n\n                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1          Q   And what do you consider to be a significant\n 2   portion to be?\n 3          A   More than half.\n 4          Q   Okay.     I think a moment ago, you qualified\n 5   the figure of -- that appears on Page 14, the\n 6   75.2 million?\n 7          A   Yes, ma'am.\n\n 8          Q   You said that the -- a settlement would\n 9   impact that?\n10          A   Yes, ma'am.\n11          Q   How do you anticipate it would impact it?\n12          A   I can't estimate that with any certainty at\n13   this time, but it would be a smaller number than\n14   that\n15          Q   Okay.\n\n16          A    -- were the settlement to be adopted.\n17          Q   Okay.\n18                      MS.

GRIFFITHS:\n\n 3       Q    Okay.    Mr. May, the $75.2 million figure on\n\n 4   Page 14 of your testimony, that is based on the\n\n 5   coincident peak demand of the LIPS accounts for the\n\n 6   test year ending June 30th, 2009.      Is that correct?\n\n 7       A    I think it's actually billing determinants,\n\n B   is what that's based upon.\n\n 9       Q    Okay.    Could you take a look at your\n\n10   testimony starting on Page 13 and then looking at that\n\n11   next Q and A on Page 14?\n\n12       A     (Witness complying.)\n\n13       Q    And you estimate that the coincident peak\n\n14   demand of the LIPS class is approximately\n\n15   651 megawatts.    Correct?\n\n16       A    Yes.\n\n17       Q    All right.     You don't anticipate that all\n\n18   651 megawatts would move to the CGS load, do you?\n\n19       A    I don't have a way to estimate how much\n\n20   would.\n\n21       Q    So the answer is no?\n22       A     I have no way of estimating it.\n\n23       Q    And the generation portion of the LIPS\n\n24   revenue requirement you state is 75.2 million.        That\n\n25   is the entire -- based on the entire LIPS billing\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                                       16~\n\n                PUC: 37744 SOAR: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1   determinants.        Correct?\n 2       A       Yes, ma'am.     We know with certainty what the\n 3   actual unit cost of the difference between LIPS and\n 4   CGS is.    We just don't know what volume to apply to\n 5   that.     We'll know that through participation in the\n 6   program.\n 7       Q      All right.      So you don't know those costs\n 8   now, and you can't measure --\n 9       A       No.\n10       Q             them at this point?\n11       A      We know those costs with certainty.         We don't\n12   know what the volume would be applied to those costs.\n13       Q       Okay.     If you could turn to your exhibits\n14   that contain the competitive generation services\n15   unrecovered service cost rider.\n16       A       Yes, ma'am.\n17       Q      And that is          I'm referring you to Page 7.\n18   Correct -- or I'm sorry            to Page 7.   And I think the\n19   Bates number at the bottom is 3-339?\n20       A       Yes, ma'am.\n21       Q      All right.      You're not actually proposing any\n22   rate adjustment specifically in this tariff, are you?\n23       A       No.     There's no volume that is estimated at\n24   this time to apply to that tariff, so there is no\n25   number in there.\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                        SOAH DOCKET NO.

And so you propose that the\n 4   unserved energy rate be provided in the same manner as\n 5   stand-by service is provided to customers who own\n 6   their own generation.     Is that right?\n 7       A    Right.    Given that they're essentially the\n 8   same type of service, I didn't feel that there was a\n 9   need to discriminate against the CGS customer.\n10       Q    And that's rate schedule SMS.      Correct?\n11       A    Yes.\n12       Q    That's a cost-based rate.     Would you agree?\n13       A     It's more or less a cost-based rate, yes.\n14       Q    And that SMS rate includes a demand charge.\n15   Right?\n16       A    Yes.\n17       Q    And just to clarify, you're agreeing that if\n18   the SMS rate is utilized for unserved energy, that CGS\n19   customers would indeed pay that demand charge as well?\n20       A    Yes, they would.\n21       Q    Are you familiar with fuel cost recovery in\n22   Texas, sir?\n23       A    Yes.\n24       Q    Earlier I believe you heard some questions of\n25   Mr. Nalepa about whether or not the avoided costs that\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                                ~bl\n\n             PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                              VOLUME 4\n\n 1   a CGS customer might pay would be above or below the\n 2   average cost to customers --\n 3       A       Yes.\n 4       Q       -- non-CGS customers?\n 5       A       I heard the questions, yes.\n 6       Q       And do you know whether the effects of\n 7   whether or not the avoided cost that is above or below\n 8   the average fuel cost charge to CGS customers will\n 9   flow through the fuel rate?\n10       A       Well, the costs that the CGS customers are\n\n11   charged might not be reflected in the fuel rate, but\n12   to the extent that the CGS customer is taking 24/7\n\n13   power off of the system -- and that's basically taking\n14   it away from Entergy Texas generation purchased power\n15   supply -- that will have an effect on the cost flowed\n16   through the Texas fuel factor.\n\n17       Q       Right .   Let's talk a little bit about cost\n18   recovery.     Do you agree that ETI will in fact incur\n19   costs to set up and administer the CGS program?\n\n20       A       Yes.\n21       Q       And do you agree that if a LIPS customer\n22   decides to switch to CGS service that ETI will not\n23   collect the fixed production cost included in the LIPS\n24   rate from that customer?\n\n25       A       I think the fact that the customer has\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC .\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                 VOLUME 4\n\n 1   switched and the Company is not collecting the same\n 2   revenue certainly creates the potential that some\n 3   costs would be uncollected\n 4       Q      All right.\n 5       A       -- unrecovered.\n 6       Q      And that cost will go unrecovered unless\n 7   there is some additional revenues to --\n 8       A      Exactly, unless there are some additional\n 9   benefits to offset those unrecovered costs .       That's\n10   correct.\n11       Q       I think earlier in your testimony in this\n12   section you quote the statute, 39.452(b) at Page 36.\n13   Let me know when you're there.\n14                    MS. GRIFFITHS:    What page are you on?\n15                    MR. BREEDVELD:     Page 36.\n16                    MS. FERRIS:     Is that of his direct?\n17                    MR. BREEDVELD:    Yes, I'm sorry, direct\n18   testimony.\n19       Q       (BY MR. BREEDVELD)    Okay.   About a third of\n20   the way down, sir, do you see where the statute says\n21   that the utility's rates shall be set in this\n22   proceeding in which the tariff is adopted to recover\n23   any costs that are unrecovered as a result of the\n24   implementation tariff?\n25       A      Yes, it states that.\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                                34~\n\n              PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                               VOLUME 4\n\n 1       A    Based on the adjusted test-year, yes.\n 2       Q    And the rate-setting process that we are\n 3   describing does not concern itself about what may\n 4   occur after rates are set.     Right?   At least at that\n 5   time?\n 6       A    That's correct.     The assumption is   that~\n\n 7   reasonable revenue level has been set prospectively\n a   and that the conditions may change up or down, and it\n\n 9   may be different in the future.\n\n10       Q    And you agree that when you set rates, the\n11   company should have the opportunity to recover the\n12   revenue requirement that those rates are based on.\n13   Right?\n14       A    The cost of service rates are set at a level\n15   that the commission has determined will produce a\n16   reasonable opportunity to recover cost.      Whether or\n17   not it does or does not is within the range of\n18   conditions that may exist in the future and, of\n19   course, the company can always file another case if,\n\n20   in fact, revenues no longer cover cost.\n21       Q    I think we are not disagreeing.      I think I\n22   said you would agree that the company should have the\n23   opportunity to recover the revenue requirement or the\n24   cost that rates are based on.     Right?\n25       A    What I said is the commission determined when\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                                  3~0\n\n                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                 VOLUME 4\n\n 1   it set the rates in the rate case, that would provide\n 2   a reasonable opportunity to recover cost of service.\n\n 3       Q      And the CGS program should not impede that\n 4   opportunity to recover those costs as established in\n\n 5   that adjusted test-year.     Correct?\n 6       A       I would say in an ideal world, yes, that's\n 7   correct.\n 8       Q      And the costs that may go unrecovered due to\n 9   the CGS program, they are reflected as part of the\n\n10   overall embedded costs in the test-year -- right --\n11   that the rates are set on?\n12       A      There were costs allocated to the CGS\n13   customers and to their class.      So in that sense, yes.\n14   After the rates are set, there really is no attempt to\n15   track particular components to particular --\n16   particular cost components to particular customers.\n17       Q      But those costs are not incremental costs by\n18   any means.     Right?   Costs that are -- for example, the\n19   LIPS embedded cost of service in the test-year has\n20   nothing to do with incremental cost that may be\n21   incurred after the rates are set.       Right?    They are\n22   costs that are in the test-year -- embedded historical\n23   costs.     Right?\n24       A      Embedded costs for allocated LIPS, they were\n25   part of the overall cost of service that the\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f              PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                               VOLUME 4\n\n 1   commission approves in the rate case.\n 2       Q     If you set aside the CGS program for a\n 3   minute, once rates are set, typically revenues can\n 4   change, the cost can change as well.      Correct?\n s       A     That's correct.\n 6       Q    And if you set aside the CGS program for a\n 7   minute, if the company had increased revenues, those\n 8   increased revenues could be applied to off set or\n 9   recover increased cost.     They are not reflected in the\n10   test-year.     Right?\n11       A     Yes, that's possible.    I mean --\n12       Q     That's typically how a rate setting has\n13   worked -- base rate setting has worked at the\n14   commission .    Right?\n\n15       A     Well, the revenues are not normally dedicated\n16   to particular uses, but certainly as costs increase,\n17   the company will use the revenues to cover changes and\n18   conditions that occur after the test-year.\n\n19       Q     So you are asking that the revenues -- the\n20   sales growth revenues, any of the company realizes, be\n21   dedicated to off set embedded costs that are in the\n22   historical test-year -- right -- that may be foregone\n23   because of the CGS program?\n24       A     Yes, that's correct.\n25       Q     And to the extent you do that -- to the\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                   VOLUME 4\n\n 1   extent there is revenue growth, it won't be available\n 2   to cover other cost increases that may occur after the\n 3   rates are set.     Correct?\n 4       A      That's possible.      It could -- as I said, it\n 5   could affect the extent to which the company may\n 6   accelerate its need for a rate case in the future.\n 7                    MR.

WILLIAMS:\n\n 9         Q     Hi Mr. Mendoza.\n10         A     Hi.\n11         Q     Under the CGS program, as you understand it,\n12   Mr. Mendoza, the company buys from QFs that avoided\n13   cost.     Right?\n14         A     Yes, sir, that's correct.\n15         Q     So long as QF put is made available, the\n16   company collects no more from CGS customers in that\n17   same avoided cost.        Right?\n\n18         A     Yes, sir, that's correct.\n\n19         Q     So there is nothing in it for the company\n20   regarding the purchase of avoided cost -- right -- in\n21   terms of prof it or margin?\n22         A     It's a simple pass-through as I understand\n23   it.\n24                      THE REPORTER:     Can you speak up, please.\n25                      WITNESS MENDOZA:     Yes.\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                 VOLUME 4\n\n 1                    THE REPORTER:    I didn't get your last\n 2   answer.\n\n 3       A       It's a simple pass-through.\n 4       Q       (BY MR. WILLIAMS)    And you also understand,\n s   do you not, that if the QF put is not available, if\n 6   the company has to provide what's called unserved\n 7   energy, then under that tariff, the customers get any\n 8   margins from those sales -- float through them through\n 9   the fuel clause .      Do you understand that as well?\n10       A      Yes, sir.\n11       Q       So again, there is no opportunity for the\n12   company to make a prof it or a windfall off that aspect\n13   of the program either .      Right?\n14       A      Not the way I understand it, no.\n15       Q       Is part of your recommendation that the\n16   commission consider getting -- taking base rate\n17   revenues associated with load growth to recoup\n18   unrecovered cost associated with the CGS program.          Is\n19   that right?\n\n20       A      Yes, sir, that's correct.\n21       Q      More generally, is it Staff's position that\n22   the proposed CGS program should be rejected because\n23   it's not consistent with traditional rate-making\n24   principles.     Is that sort of a summary of your\n25   concern?\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f             PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                              VOLUME 4\n\n 1       A    That could be one way to look at it.\n\n 2       Q    And as we talked about with Mr. Johnson, both\n 3   principles include that rates are supposed to be\n 4   designed to recover adjusted test-year cost.        Right?\n\n 5       A    Under a rate case?\n\n 6       Q    Yes .\n\n 7       A    Yes, that's correct.\n\n 8       Q    And traditional rate setting does not concern\n 9   itself with incremental costs from revenues that occur\n10   after the period addressed in the rate case.        Right?\n\n11       A    For base rates?\n\n12       Q    Yes, sir.\n13       A    For base rates, yes.\n\n14       Q    And it would be completely improper here if\n15   you would have not, for example, set rates at a level\n\n16   below that is shown by the test-year in the hope that\n17   some later incremental revenue might make up the\n\n18   difference.

Introduction\n            This interim order addresses the Commission's decision regarding three threshold issues\nsurrounding Entergy Texas, Inc.'s ( ETI's) proposed competitive generation service (CGS). The\n\nCommission makes its determination on these three threshold issues so the parties can move\nforward with the remaining issues that parties have characterized as being contingent on\nCommission decisions on the threshold issues:           ( 1) what types of costs that will be considered\nunrecovered for purposes of PURA § 39.452(b); ( 2) what types of ETI customers will be eligible\n\nfor participation in the CGS program; and (3) which ETI customers will be responsible for\npaying the unrecovered costs.\n\n            ETI, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Industrial Energy\nConsumers, State Agencies, Kroger Co., Cities,' Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and Sam's East,\nInc. participated in this docket.\n\n\n\n                                       II.        Procedural History\n        ETI submitted its proposed CGS tariff and related riders in Docket No. 37744, its last rate\ncase.2 In that rate case, the parties settled on all issues except for ETI's CGS proposal. After a\nhearing on the CGS proposal and the associated riders, the administrative law judge (ALJ)\n\n        I\n           The cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Groves, Houston, Huntsville,\nMontgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches,\nRose City, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange.\n        zApplication of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs,\nDocket No. 37744, Corrected Application (Feb. 23, 2010).\n\n\n                                                                                                              e^  l\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                          000000001\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Interim Order                                    Page 2 of 17\n\n\n\nforwarded the parties' stipulation and settlement agreement and the proposal for decision to the\nCommission for consideration.\n\n        The Commission considered the settlement and the proposal for decision at the\nNovember 10 and December 1, 2010 open meetings. The Commission adopted the settlement\nfor the rate case issues and severed the CGS issues into this docket, including the record in\nDocket No. 37744.3\n\n        At the December 1, 2010 open meeting, the Commission requested the parties to enter\ninto negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined CGS program\nissues as possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\nthe Commission for consideration. Status reports were filed on January 13 and 28, February 18,\nMarch 11, and April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that\nthey were working to narrow the contested issues.\n\n        On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\na motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket.                     TIEC and\nCommission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion. At the\nSeptember 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and issued an\norder requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that have been\nsettled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could not be reached.\nThe parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent upon the Commission's\ndetermination of the unsettled issues.\n\n        On November 1, 2011, several parties4 filed an agreed list of settled issues. However, the\nparties did not agree on a recommendation as to how the unsettled issues and issues that are\ncontingent on the Commission's determination of unsettled issues should be addressed and\nresolved by the Commission. Therefore, TIEC also separately filed a list of unsettled issues and\nrequest for procedural schedule.      TIEC also requested that the Commission receive additional\nevidence in order to resolve the unrecovered costs issue because ETI's proposal in Docket\nNo. 37744 was based on ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and\n\n        3 Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs,\nDocket No. 37744, Order No. 14 Memorializing Decision Granting Motion to Sever ( Dec. 3, 2010).\n         ' Cities, Entergy, OPUC, Commission Staff, State Agencies, and Wal-Mart/Sam's East.

T1EC reported that during the time period when the parties were\nnegotiating the Entergy Operating Committee had agreed that CGS power from qualifying\nfacilities in the ETI service territory could provide firm generation. 5\n\n        At the December 8 and December 15, 2011 open meetings, the Commission decided that\nthe parties should submit stipulated facts, the Commission would re-open the record to admit\nadditional evidence, and then the Commission would make a decision on the unsettled issues.\nAfter that, the Commission planned to issue an interim order reflecting the decisions on the\nunsettled, threshold issues.\n\n        On January 20, 2012, the parties submitted agreed settlement terms and stipulated facts.\nThe parties reached agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within the overall\nframework of the CGS program and tariffs. Many of the items are simply elements of larger\nprogram issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects essential to final resolution of that\nprogram issue. Items as to which agreement in principle exists are \"subject to satisfactory\nresolution of unsettled issues. ,6\n\n        On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                                      On\nFebruary 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\nFebruary 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.                       The\nparties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n        On April 13, 2012, the parties submitted an unopposed stipulation on the threshold issue\nregarding customers responsible for paying unrecovered costs. The parties, except ETI, agreed\nthat CGS customers would be the only ETI customers responsible for unrecovered costs of the\nCGS program. ETI did not join or oppose this stipulation.7                  On April 18, 2012, the parties\nsubmitted a third stipulation on customer eligibility stating that LIPS customers would be the\nCGS-eligible customers, with certain limitations on the LIPS customers' participation and other\nprogram minimums and caps.8\n\n\n\n\n       5 TIEC's Response to Joint Motion for Decision on Proposal for Decision at 4 (Sep. 15, 2011).\n       6 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts (Jan. 20, 2012).\n         Unopposed Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 3 (Apr. 13, 2012).\n         Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 2 (Apr. 18, 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                      000000003\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Interim Order                                    Page 4 of 17\n\n\n\n         The Commission held a hearing on the remaining contested threshold issue on\nApril 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                            III.     Discussion\n         PURA9 § 39.452(b) requires ETI to propose a CGS tariff that would require ETI to\npurchase CGS, selected by the CGS customer, and provide the generation at retail to the\ncustomer. ETI is required to provide and price retail transmission service, including necessary\nancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive\ngeneration tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the utility's cost of service.             Competitive\ngeneration customers are not to be considered wholesale transmission customers. The statute\nrequired the Commission to approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than\nSeptember 1, 2010. The CGS tariff may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates\nunder Section 36.007, and ETI's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is\nadopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff. The\nstatute requires the Commission to ensure that a competitive generation tariff not be\nimplemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers that\nchoose not to take advantage of competitive generation. PURA § 39.452(b) also prohibits the\nCommission from issuing a decision relating to the competitive generation tariff that is contrary\nto an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having\njurisdiction.\n\n         The Commission finds that the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements are\nreasonable and adopts them to the extent they do not conflict with other Commission\ndeterminations in this docket.\n\n         Adoption of the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements leaves one threshold issue\nremaining: the types of costs that will be considered ETI's unrecovered costs for purposes of\nPURA § 39.452(b). The Commission finds that unrecovered costs are only those costs necessary\nto implement and administer the CGS program and are not to be defined to include lost revenues,\nembedded generation costs, or any other types of costs.\n\n\n\n         ' Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), TEX.

Eligible Customers Stipulation\n        The Commission adopts the stipulation and settlement regarding eligible customers and\nfinds that LIPS customers are the ETI customers that will be eligible to participate in the CGS\nprogram (with further Iimitations as set forth in the parties' stipulation on this issue).10\n\n\n            B. Customers Responsible for Paying Unrecovered Costs Stipulation\n        The Commission also adopts the stipulation and settlement regarding determining which\ncustomers      will   be    responsible       for      paying   the   unrecovered   costs   referenced   in\nPURA § 39.452(b). To the extent there are costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of\n\nthe CGS program tariff, those costs will be borne solely by customers taking service under the\nCGS tarif£ \"\n\n\n             C. January 20, 2012 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\n        The Commission adopts the stipulated facts submitted by the parties on January 20, 2012\nregarding ETI's capacity deficit and the program cap and notes that the items that are a part of\nthe \"agreed settlement terms\" regarding eligible CGS suppliers, amount of CGS capacity, the\nCGS customer unbundled rate, the CGS energy payment, the CGS customer fixed-cost\ncontribution, the CGS customer unserved energy rate, and the recognition of CGS supply as firm\ncapacity are items for which there is only an agreement in principle that are subject to\nsatisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.12\n\n\n                                          D. Unrecovered Costs\n       The remaining threshold issue, the meaning of \"costs unrecovered as a result of\nimplementation of the CGS program tariff,\" as used in PURA § 39.452(b), was the subject of the\nApril 19, 2012 hearing. In the proposal for decision, the ALJ found that ETI is entitled to collect\nunrecovered embedded generation costs and any other related base rate costs as a result of\ncustomer migration to the CGS program.13\n\n\n\n\n       'o Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 2 (Apr. 18, 2012).\n\n       \" Unopposed Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 3 (Apr. 13, 2012).\n       'Z CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts at 1(Jan. 20, 2012).\n\n       \" Proposal for Decision at 22 (Oct. 5, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               000000005\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                              Interim Order                                      Page 6 of 17\n\n\n\n         ETI argued that unrecovered costs should be defined as the embedded production costs\nand any other related base rate costs that would have been recovered through traditional rates\ncharged to CGS customers that will no longer be recovered due to the CGS program.14 TIEC\ntook the position that unrecovered costs should not include ETI's hypothetical lost revenues and\nthat the costs that could be unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff should include\nthe expenditures actually incurred by ETI to implement and maintain the CGS program.ts Cities\nand OPUC agreed with TIEC that unrecovered costs are not the same thing as unrecovered\nrevenues. 16 Cities also noted that it would be unreasonable to allow ETI to continue to incur\ncosts for a customer the utility no longer plans to serve. 17\n\n        In making its determination of the definition of unrecovered costs, the Commission\nfollows the precedent set in CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC v. Pub. Util. Comm 'n,\n354 S.W.3d 899 (Tex. App-Austin, 2011 no pet.) where the Third Court of Appeals found that\nbecause the language of PURA § 39.905 did not specifically provide for recovery of \"lost\nrevenues\" and that in at least two other provisions of PURA 18 the legislature expressly\ndistinguishes \"costs\" from \"revenues,\" the term \"costs,\" as used by the legislature in\nPURA § 39.905, is not intended to include lost revenues.19                           Like PURA § 39.905,\nPURA § 39.452(b) only provides for \"costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of the\ntariff' and does not specifically provide for the utility to recover lost revenues or any other type\nof costs.\n\n        Based on the evidence and testimony, the Commission finds that the proper interpretation\nof \"costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of the CGS program tariff' is costs to\nimplement and administer the CGS program tariff. Such unrecovered costs do not include lost\nrevenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs. The Commission reverses the\nproposal for decision on this issue.\n\n\n        14 Supplemental Direct Testimony, Exhibits, and Workpapers of Phillip R.

Conclusion\n         The Commission adopts each of the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements and\nfinds that unrecovered costs for the CGS program are those needed to implement and administer\nthe CGS program and are not lost revenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of\ncosts.\n\n\n\n                                      V.         Findings of Fact\n\nProcedural History\nI.       As part of its application in Docket No. 37744, Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for\n         Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, ETI proposed a competitive\n         generation service (CGS) program pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act. Tex. Util.\n         Code Ann. (PURA) § 39.452(b).\n\n2.       On July 16, 2010 and July 20, 2010, a State Office of Administrative Hearings\n         administrative law judge held a hearing on the merits on ETI's CGS proposal.\n\n3.       A proposal for decision was issued on November             1, 2010.   The ALJ ultimately\n         recommended that the CGS proposal be rejected.\n\n4.       The Commission considered the proposal for decision at the November 10 and\n         December 1, 2010 open meetings as part of Docket No. 37744. At the December 1, 2010\n         open meeting, the Commission adopted the settlement for the rate case issues and severed\n         the CGS proposal into this Docket. The Commission requested that the parties enter into\n         negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined issues as\n         possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\n         the Commission for consideration.\n\n5.       Order No. I was issued on December 3, 2010 severing the CGS issues into this docket,\n         including the record in Docket No. 37744.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       000000007\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Interim Order                                    Page 8 of 17\n\n\n6.      Sabine Cogen, LP filed a motion to intervene in this docket on December 23, 2010. ETI\n\n        tiled an objection to Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene on December 30, 2010.\n        Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene was denied in Order No. 3 on January 12, 2011.\n\n7.      ETI, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Industrial Energy\n        Consumers, State Agencies, Kroger Co., Cities,20 Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and\n        Sam's East, Inc., and Cottonwood Energy are parties to this proceeding.\n\n8.      On January 11, 2011, the Commission ALJ issued Order No. 2 requiring ETI to either\n        provide an update on the status of settlement discussions or to propose a schedule, agreed\n        to by all parties, for finalizing the outstanding issues.\n\n9.      The parties filed status reports on January 13 and 28, February 18, March 11, and\n        April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that they\n        thought that they could narrow the issues.\n\n10.     On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\n        a motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket. TIEC and\n        Commission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion.\n        At the September 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and\n        issued an order requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that\n        have been settled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could\n        not be reached. The parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent\n        upon the Commission's determination of the unsettled issues.\n\n11.     On November 1, several parties filed an agreed list of settled issues.                 TIEC also\n        separately filed a list of unsettled issues and request for procedural schedule. TIEC also\n        requested that the Commission receive additional evidence in order to resolve the\n        unrecovered costs issues because ETI's proposal in Docket No. 37744 was based on\n        ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and capacity-based program.\n        The circumstances had changed primarily due to the agreement of the Entergy Operating\n        to treat CGS power from qualifying facilities in the ETI service territory as firm\n\n\n        20 The cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Groves, Houston, Huntsville,\nMontgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches,\nRose City, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              000000008\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                         Interim Order                               Page 9 of 17\n\n\n\n       generation. The remainder of the parties tiled a joint agreed list of unsettled issues and\n       issues contingent on a Commission determination of unsettled issues.\n\n12.    At the December 8 and December 15, 2011 open meetings, the Commissioners decided\n       that the parties should submit stipulated facts, the Commission would re-open the record\n       to admit additional evidence as requested by TIEC, and then the Commission would\n       make a decision on the three threshold unsettled issues in an interim order.\n\n13.    On December 18, 2011, Order No. 4 was issued establishing a procedural schedule.\n\n14.    On January 20, 2012, the parties submitted agreed settlement terms and stipulated facts.\n       The parties reached agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within the\n       overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs.              Many of the items are simply\n       elements of larger program issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects\n       essential to final resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in\n       principle exists are \"subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.\"\n\n15.    On January 24, 2012, Order No. 5 was issued clarifying the number of copies of\n       testimony that were to be filed by the parties.\n\n16.    On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                         On\n       February 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\n       February 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.\n       The parties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n17.    Order No. 6 was issued on February 1, 2012 setting April 19, 2012 as the date for the\n       hearing.\n\n18.    On April 13, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation that to the extent there are\n       costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be\n       borne solely by customers taking service under the CGS tariff. ETI did not join but did\n       not oppose the stipulation.\n\n19.    On April 18, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation regarding customer\n       eligibility. LIPS customers will be eligible to participate in ETI's CGS program (with\n       further limitations as set forth in the stipulation on this issue).\n\n20.    The Commission held the hearing on the merits on April 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        000000009\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                        Interim Order                               Page 10 of 17\n\n\n\nElizible customers stipulation\n21.     The parties agreed that only customers eligible to take service under ETI's Large\n        Industrial Power Service ( LIPS) are eligible customers for the CGS program.\n\n22.     The parties agreed that only LIPS firm load will be eligible to participate in the CGS\n        program.\n\n23.     The parties agreed that LIPS customers with interruptible service (IS) or standby and\n        maintenance service (SMS) load are not precluded from participating in the CGS\n        program, but this participation is limited to their firm LIPS load.      To the extent that\n        customers with IS load participate in the CGS program, they must comply with the terms\n        of the IS tariffs regarding minimum LIPS load. Only the portion of the customer's LIPS\n        load that is in excess of the firm contract power minimum requirement under section 1 of\n        Schedule IS is eligible for the CGS program.\n\n24.     The parties agreed that to the extent there are increased administration costs associated\n        with billing a customer that has CGS and IS or SMS load, the CGS customer will bear the\n        costs.\n\n25.     The parties agreed that there will be a 115 MW cap on the CGS program.\n\n26.    The parties agreed that there will be a 5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\n27.    The parties agreed that there will be no aggregation of CGS customer load to meet the\n        5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\n28.    The parties agreed that there will be a cap of 10 CGS purchase agreements.\n\nCustomers responsible for Paying unrecovered costs stipulation\n\n29.    The parties, except ETI, agreed that to the extent there are costs unrecovered as a result of\n       the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be borne solely by customers\n       taking service under the CGS tariff, i.e., CGS customers.         ETI did not oppose this\n       stipulation.\n\nJanuary 20, 2012 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\n\n30.    In the CGS stipulated matters and stipulated facts filed on January 20, 2012, the parties\n       stated they had reached an agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        000000010\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                        Interim Order                               Page 11 of 17\n\n\n\n       the overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs, which were listed in\n       Section I. A-G of the stipulation. However, many of those items are simply elements of\n       larger program issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects essential to final\n       resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in principle exists, subject\n       to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues, include the following:\n\n       A.      Eligible CGS suppliers\n\n               1.        Eligible CGS suppliers will be limited to qualifying facilities that are or\n       will be directly connected to ETI.       Any expansion of eligible CGS suppliers would\n       require initiation of new Commission proceedings.\n\n       B.      Amount of CGS capacity\n\n               1.        A CGS customer will specify the amount of its load to be served by a\n       specified CGS supplier.\n\n               2.        The specified CGS supplier will enter into a contract with Entergy\n       Services, Inc., on behalf of ETI, or directly with ETI, for the purpose of becoming an\n       Entergy system network resource. The agreement between the CGS supplier and Entergy\n       Services, Inc. or ETI shall include a contract for the purchase of capacity and energy\n       (CGS purchase agreement). Per determination of the Entergy Operating Committee, the\n       capacity and energy contracted for under the CGS purchase agreements shall be allocated\n\n        solely to ETI.\n\n               3.        The level of capacity contracted for under the CGS purchase agreement\n        (CGS contract capacity) will be the same level of capacity contracted for in a separate but\n        related contract between the CGS supplier and the CGS customer.\n\n               4.        The monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be calculated monthly based on\n        the on-peak energy deliveries of CGS-supplied energy from the CGS supplier.              The\n\n        monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be the lesser of the CGS contract capacity and the\n        result of the following calculation-on a rolling 12-month basis (using a cumulative basis\n        during the first 11 months), the sum of the CGS-supplied energy delivered by the CGS\n        supplier during on-peak hours, divided by the number of on-peak hours during the same\n        time period, divided by 0.8.     On-peak hours are defined as the hours ending 7:00 am\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        000000011\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                       Interim Order                              Page 12 of 17\n\n\n       through 10:00 pm Monday through Saturday, excluding North American Electric\n\n       Reliability Corporation holidays.\n\n       C.      CGS-customer unbundled rate\n\n               1.      CGS customers are limited to, and will remain, ETI retail customers.\n\n               2.      ETI will not make a capacity payment to the CGS supplier, and the CGS\n       customer will not pay ETI the embedded production cost in the firm rate schedule under\n       which the customer would otherwise be eligible to receive service.\n\n               3.      The price for retail delivery service, including necessary ancillary\n       services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive generation\n       tariff will be a rate that is unbundled from ETI's cost of service and that will be\n       determined by a credit to the CGS customer's bill based on the unbundled production\n       costs associated with the otherwise applicable firm rate.\n\n              4.       The unbundled, embedded production cost for a LIPS customer based on\n       current rates is $6.84 per kW per month. The CGS credit is subject to review and\n       modification in subsequent rate cases. If the clause \"less any corresponding concurrent\n       reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer\" referenced in section F.1 below is\n       adopted, then certain parties may recommend a further adjustment to the LIPS embedded\n       production cost specified in this paragraph C.4.\n\n               5.      With the exception of the capacity credit and fixed fuel factor, a CGS\n       customer will pay ETI a retail rate that includes all other charges the customer would pay\n       as a firm customer (for example Rider TTC, HRC, SRC, SRO, and IFF charges, if\n       applicable).\n\n       D.     CGS energy payment\n\n               l.      CGS customers will pay fuel costs based on avoided cost for\n       CGS-supplied energy. Specifically, ETI will purchase hourly CGS energy supplied by\n       the CGS supplier from the CGS contract capacity at the system hourly avoided-energy-\n       cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF. ETI will charge the CGS customer at the\n       same rate for that hourly CGS-supplied energy not to exceed the energy requirement of\n       the CGS customer.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      000000012\n\f                                             Interim Order                           Page 13 of 17\nPUC Docket No. 38951\n\n\n       E.       CGS customer fixed-cost contribution\n\n                l.     The level of compensation to ETI from CGS customers for CGS service\n\n       will include a monthly fixed charge called a fixed-cost contribution.\n\n                2.      The fixed-cost contribution will be $1.10 per kW of CGS load per month.\n\n                3.      Revenues from the fixed-cost contribution will reduce any otherwise\n\n       unrecovered costs associated with the program.\n\n       F.       CGS customer unserved energy rate\n\n                 l.     If, in any hour in a delivery month, there is hourly CGS unserved energy,\n       the CGS customer will take service from ETI under the CGS unserved energy rate.\n        Hourly CGS unserved energy is the difference in any given hour between the amount of\n        energy corresponding to the full amount of CGS contract capacity and the amount of\n        energy actually supplied to ETI from the CGS contract capacity by the CGS supplier in\n        such hour, not to exceed the energy requirement of the CGS customer. The parties have\n        not agreed whether the following clause should be added to this last sentence: \"less any\n        corresponding concurrent reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer.\"\n\n                 2.     The structure of the CGS unserved energy tariffed rate will include an\n        agreed energy charge and agreed O&M adder. The monthly CGS unserved energy\n        charge will be the sum of (a) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times 105%\n        of the system hourly avoided energy cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF and\n        (b) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times specified variable O&M charges\n\n        specified immediately below in paragraph 3.\n\n                 3.     The specified variable O&M charges for the CGS unserved energy rate are\n        as follows:\n\n            Delivery Voltage                    On-Peak Per kWh        Off-Peak Per kWh\n\n            Distribution (less than 69kV)       $0.03555               0.00540\n\n            Transmission     (69kV     and      $0.02451               0.00222\n\n            greater)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     000000013\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                       Interim Order                              Page 14 of 17\n\n\n\n                4.      On-peak and off-peak hours for the CGS unserved energy rate are as\n       follows:\n\n                        a.     Summer: On-peak hours are 1:00 pm to 9:00 pm Monday through\n       Friday of each week beginning on May 15 and continuing through October 15 of each\n       year except that Memorial Day, Labor Day and Independence Day (July 4 or the nearest\n       weekday if July 4 is on a weekend) are not on-peak.\n\n                        b.     Winter: On-peak hours for each week of Monday through Friday\n       beginning October 16 and continuing through May 14 of each year are 6:00 am to\n       10:00 am and 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm, except that Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and\n       New Year's Day (or the nearest weekday if the holiday should fall on a weekend) are not\n       on-peak.\n\n                        c.    Off-peak hours are all hours of the year not specified as on-peak\n       hours.     With the approval of the Commission, ETI may at its sole discretion change\n       on-peak hours and season from time to time.\n\n                5.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from the variable\n       O&M charges will go towards offsetting any unrecovered costs as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS tariff.\n\n                6.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from 105% of the\n      system hourly avoided energy charges will go towards offsetting ETI's eligible fuel costs.\n\n      G.        Recognition of CGS supply as firm capacity.         Progress has been made on\n      resolving issues regarding the recognition of CGS capacity as firm capacity, but final\n      resolution of these issues, including the following, is contingent on the Entergy Operating\n      Committee's approval as well as a final resolution of all issues.\n\n                1.     The Entergy Operating Committee has established certain conditions that\n      must be met before it will recognize a CGS purchase agreement as \"capability\" for the\n      Entergy System, for purposes of determining reserve equalization payments or receipts.\n      The parties are continuing to discuss the conditions established by the Operating\n      Committee.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      000000014\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                       Interim Order                              Page 15 of 17\n\n\n\n               2.      The capacity product from CGS purchase agreements will be a 24/7\n       unit-contingent product.\n\n               3.      The delivery term of CGS purchase agreements may be from one year to\n\n       five years, and must be a whole number of years.\n\n               4.      The contract capacity will be a fixed capacity amount throughout any\n\n       successive 12-month period during the contract term.\n\n               5.      The parties have tentatively agreed to a number of concepts for firming up\n        CGS capacity that would be reflected in a form contract for use in implementing the CGS\n        program. The parties will continue to negotiate other concepts and terms for inclusion in\n\n        a form supply contract.\n\n31.     The parties stipulated that the Strategic Resource Plan (SRP) for the Entergy system (of\n        which ETI is a part) projects a continuing need for additional capacity for ETI and the\n        Entergy system through 2017. Entergy's and ETI's resource needs are subject to change\n        at any time based on actual experience related to operational conditions, resource offers\n        and solicitations, and other events that affect resource needs.\n\n32.     The parties stipulated that based on an assessment of load requirements and generating\n        capability, the SRP projects that ETI has an incremental net resource deficiency of\n\n        260 MW in 2012 and 504 MW in 2013.\n\n33.     The parties stipulated that the Entergy system-wide planning process is conducted\n        pursuant to the requirements of the Entergy system agreement and is designed to result in\n        a portfolio of resources that differ by term and source. The Entergy system agreement\n        states that the objective of this process is to ensure cost-effective, reliable levels of\n\n        service.\n\n 34.    The parties stipulated that CGS purchase agreements are resources that will be included\n        in the Entergy System's portfolio of supply resources, consistent with the terms and\n        conditions related to the delivery requirements of those purchase agreements (e.g., degree\n\n        of dispatchability, term, degree of firmness).\n\n 35.    The parties stipulated that it is reasonable at the outset of the CGS program to establish a\n        cap on the amount of load that may subscribe to CGS service.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       000000015\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                        Interim Order                                 Page 16 of 17\n\n\n36.    The parties stipulated that the range of the cap should be between 80 MW and 150 MW.\n\nUnrecovered costs\n\n37.    It is reasonable to adopt the three unopposed stipulation-and-settlement agreements\n       regarding customer eligibility for the CGS program; the customers responsible for paying\n       for unrecovered costs; the capacity deficit; and the program cap.\n\n38.    PURA § 39.452(b) provides for the utility to be able to recover any costs unrecovered as\n       a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\n39.    In CenterPoint, the Third Court of Appeals found that because the language of\n       PURA § 39.905 did not specifically provide for recovery of \"lost revenues\" and that in at\n       least two other provisions of PURA the legislature expressly distinguishes \"costs\" from\n       \"revenues,\" the term \"costs,\" as used by the legislature in PURA § 39.905, is not\n       intended to include lost revenues.       Like PURA § 39.905, PURA § 39.452(b) only\n       provides for \"costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff\" and does not\n       specifically provide for the utility to recover lost revenues or any other type of costs.\n\n40.    The Commission finds that the costs that will be unrecovered as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS program tariff are the costs to implement and administer the\n       CGS program tariff.\n\n\n\n                                   VI.      Conclusions of Law\nl.    The Commission has jurisdiction and authority over this proceeding pursuant to PURA\n       §§ 14.001 and 39.452(b).\n\n2.     PURA § 39.452(b) does not allow for the recovery of lost revenue or embedded\n      generation costs.\n\n\n\n                                VII.     Ordering Paragraphs\nl.    The Commission adopts each of the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements filed on\n      January 20, 2012, April 30, 2012, and April 18, 2012.\n\n2.    The parties shall work to reach an agreement on the issues that are considered contingent\n      on the Commission's decision on the threshold issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          000000016\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                   Interim Order                        Page 17 of 17\n\n\n\n3.

(“Company”) shall\n       implement and adjust rates for recovery of Unrecovered Service Cost resulting from\n       customers participating in the Company’s Competitive Generation Service (“CGS\n                                                                                                             N\n       Program”). The purpose of this Rider is to provide a mechanism for recovery of such\n       Unrecovered Service Costs that were included in the Company’s last general rate case\n       proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Texas (”PUCT”).\n\nII. APPLICABILITY\n\n       This Rider is applicable under the regular terms and conditions of the Company to all\n       electric service billed under the Company’s rate schedules subject to the jurisdiction of\n       the PUCT, with the exception of service billed under the Competitive Generation Service\n       Rider (“Rider CGS”).\n\nIII. RATE\n\n       All electric service accounts with the exception of service billed under Rider CGS will be\n       billed the Rider CGSUSC rates shown on Attachment A, as determined by application of\n       Attachment B.\n\nIV. RECOVERY PERIOD\n\n       This Rider is effective with the first billing cycle of ______, 201_ following the PUCT’s\n       approval of the initial rate to be charged under Rider CGSUSC. ETI will file a request for\n       PUCT approval of the initial rate no earlier than six (6) months after the PUCT’s approval\n       of the CGS Program. This Rider will remain in effect until termination of the CGS\n       Program and recovery of any remaining Unrecovered Service Cost. The redetermined\n       rates described in § V below shall become effective for bills rendered on and after the\n       first billing cycle of ______ immediately following the filing year and shall remain in effect\n       for a twelve (12) month billing period, unless otherwise terminated or superseded.\n\nV. TRUE-UP PROVISION\n\n       The rates shown on Attachment A will be adjusted annually as shown on Attachment B to\n       reflect the actual Unrecovered Service Cost incurred due to the CGS Program. On or\n       before _________ 1st of each year the Company shall file with the PUCT a revision of\n       this Rider that incorporates the actual Unrecovered Service Cost for the twelve (12)\n       months ending with _______ (“Test Period”) less any recovery under this Rider during\n       the Test Period plus or minus any prior Cumulative Over/Under Recovery plus interest.\n       Cumulative Over/Under Recovery for the Test Period is defined as the prior period\n       Cumulative Over/Under Recovery plus the difference between Unrecovered Service Cost\n\n                                   (Continued on reverse side)\n\f                                                                                       Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                      Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                             ETI OFFER OF PROOF NO. 1\n                                                                                    ([KLELW\u0003'55\u00106'\u0010\u0017\u0003\n                                                                                                54 of 86\n                                                                                    'RFNHW\u00031R\u0011\u0003\u0016\u001b\u001c\u0018\u0014\u0003\n                                                                                         3DJH\u0003\u0015\u0003RI\u0003\u0018\n\n                                                                                        Page __.2\n\n      incurred and revenues received from this Rider during the Test Period.

R. 25.28(c) and (d). Interest shall be calculated based on the principles set out in\n      the P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.236(e)(1). The Rider CGSUSC Recovery Amount shall be the\n      sum of the Cumulative Over/Under Recovery for the Test Period plus interest less any\n      CGSUSC Offsets as described in § VI below and in Attachment B. The Rider CGSUSC\n      Recovery Amount shall be allocated to the rate classes using the Production Demand\n      Allocation Factors from the most recent base-rate case adjusted to remove CGS\n      Program load and energy. The resulting rate class allocations of the Rider CGSUSC\n      Recovery Amount will be divided by the rate class billing determinants for the Test\n      Period, as adjusted to remove expected CGS Program load and energy, to determine\n      Rider CGSUSC rate class charges.\n\nVI. CGSUSC OFFSETS\n\n      CGSUSC Offsets are defined as 1) the $/kW reduction in ETI’s obligations under Entergy\n      System Agreement Service Schedule MSS-1 associated with ETI’s acquisition of CGS\n      Supplied Capacity (as defined by Rider CGS), which will be calculated pursuant to\n      Attachment B; and 2) the revenues received from the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee (as\n      defined by Rider CGS) for the Test Period.                                                           N\n\nVII. INTERIM ADJUSTMENT\n\n      Should a change in the level of estimated Rider CGSUSC Recovery Amount exceed $2\n      million, greater or less than, the estimate included in the most recently filed determination\n      under this CGSUSC Rider, then the Company may propose an interim revision to the\n      then currently effective CGSUSC rate.\n\nVIII.STAFF AND COMMISSION REVIEW\n\n      Staff shall, and any affected person may, review the ETI filed Rider CGSUSC rate to\n      verify that the formula in Attachment B has been correctly applied and shall notify the\n      Company of any necessary corrections within sixty days. After completion of this review\n      of the rate calculation, the Company shall make appropriate changes to correct\n      undisputed errors identified in the review process. Any disputed issues arising out of this\n      review process are to be resolved by the PUCT after notice and hearing.\n\n\n\n\nRIDER SCHEDULE CGSUSC\n\f                                                                                          Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                         Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                                ETI OFFER OF PROOF NO. 1\n                                                                                       ([KLELW\u0003'55\u00106'\u0010\u0017\u0003\n                                                                                                   55 of 86\n                                                                                       'RFNHW\u00031R\u0011\u0003\u0016\u001b\u001c\u0018\u0014\u0003\n                                                                                            3DJH\u0003\u0016\u0003RI\u0003\u0018\n\n                                                                                          Page ___.3\n\n                                ATTACHMENT A\n                             ENTERGY TEXAS, INC.\n          COMPETITIVE GENERATION SERVICE UNRECOVERED SERVICE COST\n                           RIDER SCHEDULE CGSUSC\n\nNet Monthly Rate\n                                                                                                              N\nThe following Rate Adjustments, as determined by Attachment B, will be added to the rates set\nout in the Net Monthly Bill for electric service billed under applicable retail rate and rider\nschedules* on file with the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

Introduction\n       This order addresses Entergy Texas, Inc.'s (ETI's) application for a competitive\ngeneration service (CGS) under PURA § 39.452(b). The Commission approves ETI's CGS rider\nand competitive generation service cost (CGSC) rider as set out in this order.\n\n       This order incorporates the Commission's interim order issued in this docket on\nJune 12, 2012 and the Commission's rulings adopting in part and rejecting in part the stipulation\nand settlement agreement filed by ETI, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC), and\nCommission Staff on May 17, 2013. The interim order addressed the Commission's decision\nregarding three threshold issues surrounding ETI's CGS program. The May 17 settlement, as\nadopted in part and rejected in part, resolves all other contested issues in this docket.\n\n\n\n                                       II. Procedural History\n       ETI submitted its proposed CGS tariff and related riders in Docket No. 37744, its last rate\ncase.' In that rate case, the parties settled on all issues except for ETI's CGS proposal. After a\nhearing on the CGS proposal and the associated riders, the administrative law judge (ALJ)\nforwarded the parties' stipulation and settlement agreement and the proposal for decision to the\nCommission for consideration.\n\n\n\n\n        I Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs,\nDocket No. 37744, Corrected Application (Feb. 23, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          o^\n\f PUC Docket No. 38951                              Order                                        Page 2 of 27\n\n\n\n            The Commission considered the settlement and the proposal for decision at the\nNovember 10 and December 1, 2010 open meetings. The Commission adopted the settlement\n for the rate case issues and severed the CGS issues into this docket, including the record in\nDocket No. 37744.2\n\n            At the December 1, 2010 open meeting, the Commission requested the parties to enter\ninto negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined CGS program\nissues as possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\nthe Commission for consideration. Status reports were filed on January 13 and 28, February 18,\nMarch 11, and April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that\nthey were working to narrow the contested issues.\n\n            On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\na motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket.                     TIEC and\nCommission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion. At its\nSeptember 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and issued an\norder requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that have been\nsettled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could not be reached.\nThe parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent upon the Commission's\ndetermination of the unsettled issues.\n\n        On November 1, 2011, several parties3 filed an agreed list of settled issues. However, the\nparties did not agree on a recommendation as to how the unsettled issues and issues that are\ncontingent on the Commission's determination of unsettled issues should be addressed and\nresolved by the Commission. Therefore, TIEC also separately filed a list of unsettled issues and\nrequest for procedural schedule. TIEC also requested that the Commission receive additional\n\nevidence in order to resolve the unrecovered costs issue because ETI's proposal in Docket\nNo. 37744 was based on ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and\ncapacity-based program.

Many of the items were simply elements of larger\nprogram issues that retained, at that time, one or more unsettled aspects essential to final\nresolution of that program issue. Items as to which there was agreement in principle were\n\"subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.\"5\n\n       On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                                       On\nFebruary 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\nFebruary 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.                       The\nparties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n       On April 13, 2012, the parties submitted an unopposed stipulation on the threshold issue\nregarding customers responsible for paying unrecovered costs. The parties, except ETI, agreed\nthat CGS customers would be the only ETI customers responsible for unrecovered costs of the\nCGS program. ETI did not join or oppose this stipulation.6                  On April 18, 2012, the parties\nsubmitted a third stipulation on customer eligibility stating that large industrial power service\n(LIPS) customers would be the CGS-eligible customers, with certain limitations on the LIPS\ncustomers' participation and other program minimums and caps.7\n\n       The Commission held a hearing on the remaining contested threshold issue-what types\nof costs will be considered unrecovered for purposes of PURA § 39.452(b)-on April 19, 2012.\n\n\n       4 TIEC's Response to Joint Motion for Decision on Proposal for Decision at 4 (Sep. 15, 2011).\n       5 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts (Jan. 20, 2012).\n       6 Unopposed Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 3 (Apr. 13, 2012).\n\n       7 Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 2 (Apr. 18, 2012).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                      Page 4 of 27\n\n\n\nAn interim order was issued on June 12, 2012. It was expected that the parties would reach\nagreement on the remaining issues.\n\n        On November 27, 2012, TIEC filed a motion to adopt a CGS program and submitted\nproposed CGS riders for approval. TIEC and ETI had not been able to resolve certain issues\nrelated to the CGS tariffs and TIEC stated that continued negotiations would only result in\nfurther delay of the implementation of the CGS program.8 Commission Staff requested that the\nparties be required to submit a procedural schedule to govern the handling of the docket.9 ETI\nsubmitted its own version of the CGS tariffs for approval and proposed procedures to lead to\nfinal disposition of this docket. 10\n\n        The Commission ALJ issued Order No. 10 adopting a procedural schedule that required\nthe parties to indicate by February 8, 2013 whether a hearing was necessary. TIEC filed a letter\nstating that no party intended to file a request for a live hearing to cross-examine witnesses on\nthe remaining contested issues.ll Cities, OPUC, ETI, TIEC, and Commission Staff filed briefs\non March 1, 2013 and reply briefs on March 20, 2013. At the April 25, 2013 open meeting, the\nparties gave oral argument and the Commissioners discussed the Entergy Operating Committee\nreview of the capacity component of the CGS program and the proposed MISO regulatory\nchange provision.      The Commission deferred its ultimate decision on all of the issues to the\nMay 9, 2013 open meeting.\n\n        On May 8, 2013, TIEC filed a letter stating that TIEC and ETI had reached a preliminary\nagreement on the remaining disputed issues, but that the other parties had not had an opportunity\nto review the agreement. 12 At the May 9 open meeting, the Commission deferred consideration\nof the docket until the May 23, 2013 open meeting.\n\n        ETI filed a stipulation and settlement agreement on May 17, 2013 that addressed each of\nthe disputed issues that remained in this case.         ETI, TIEC, and Commission Staff signed the\n\n\n        8 TIEC's Motion to Adopt a Competitive Generation Services Program (Nov. 27, 2012).\n         9 Commission Staff's Response to TIEC's Motion to Adopt a Competitive Generation Services Program\n(Dec 4, 2012).\n\n        10 Entergy's Response to TIEC's Motion to Adopt Competitive Generation Services Program and Motion\nfor Adoption of Competitive Generation Services Tariffs at 1-2 (Dec. 4, 2012).\n        11 Letter from TIEC (Feb. 8, 2013).\n        12\n           Letter from TIEC (May 8, 2013).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                  Order                                      Page 5 of 27\n\n\nstipulation. The stipulation and settlement agreement included agreement on all of the issues\nregarding the CGS rider, i.e., how the CGS program would work, but delayed approval of the\ncompetitive generation service cost (CGSC) rider, which is the rider that will include\n\nimplementation and administration costs for the CGS program, for a later date.\n\n        Specifically, the signatories to the settlement agreed that the CGSC rider would not be\nproposed for approval, but would be filed with the Commission no earlier than six months after\nthe CGS rider becomes effective.             The parties also stipulated to five issues that would be\naddressed in the CGSC rider docket. ETI noted that Commission Staff supports the stipulation,\nbut did not take a position relating to the deferral of the consideration of issues regarding the\nCGSC rider.13 OPUC, joined by Kroger Company, Wal-Mart Stores, LLC, and Sam's East, Inc.\n\nfiled a statement of opposition to the stipulation stating that their opposition was limited to\nSection II.B. of the stipulation, which allows the delay of the resolution of the CGSC rider\nissues.14 Cities filed a letter on May 21 stating that it supports the resolution of the issues in the\nstipulation, but that they also support resolving all issues at this time in order to conserve judicial\nresources and provide certainty to parties in future cases.15               TIEC filed a response to the\nopposition16 and OPUC, Kroger, Wal-Mart, and Sam's East filed a reply to TIEC's response. 17\n\n       The Commission considered this docket again on the merits at the May 23, 2013 open\nmeeting. The Commission adopts the May 17, 2013 stipulation and settlement agreement in\npart, but rejects the deferral of approval of the CGSC rider set out in section II.B.2. of the\nstipulation. The Commission adopts the stipulation and settlement agreement as it pertains to the\n\nCGS rider, and makes findings on the outstanding issues related to the CGSC rider.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (May 17, 2013).\n       14 Joint Statement of Position (May 17, 2013).\n       15\n          Cities' Letter Addressing the Settlement Reached by Entergy and TIEC (May 21, 2013).\n       16 TIEC's Response to OPUC's Statement of Opposition (May 21, 2013).\n       17 Joint Reply to TIEC's Response to the Joint Statement of Opposition (May 22, 2013).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                        Page 6 of 27\n\n\n                                             III.    Discussion\n         PURA18 § 39.452(b) requires ETI to propose a CGS tariff that would require ETI to\npurchase CGS, selected by the CGS customer, and provide the generation at retail to the\ncustomer. ETI is required to provide and price retail transmission service, including necessary\n\nancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive\ngeneration tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the utility's cost of service.              Competitive\ngeneration customers are not to be considered wholesale transmission customers.                 The statute\nrequired the Commission to approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than\nSeptember 1, 2010. The CGS tariff may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates\nunder Section 36.007, and ETI's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is\nadopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff. The\nstatute requires the Commission to ensure that a competitive generation tariff not be\nimplemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers that\nchoose not to take advantage of competitive generation. PURA § 39.452(b) also prohibits the\nCommission from issuing a decision relating to the competitive generation tariff that is contrary\nto an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having\njurisdiction.\n\n         The Commission finds that the three stipulation and settlement agreements submitted by\nthe parties in January and April 2012 are reasonable and adopts them to the extent they do not\nconflict with other Commission determinations in this docket.\n\n         The Commission also finds that unrecovered costs are only those costs necessary to\nimplement and administer the CGS program and are not to be defined to include lost revenues,\nembedded generation costs, or any other types of costs.\n\n         Finally, the Commission finds that the May 17, 2013 stipulation with regard to the CGS\n\nrider is reasonable and adopts that portion of the stipulation. The Commission declines to adopt\nthe stipulation regarding the CGSC rider, and finds that the issues regarding the CGSC rider\nshould not be deferred and that the CGSC rider should not include costs prior to implementation\nof the CGS program; LIPS and LIPS time-of-day customers should be responsible for the CGSC\n\n\n\n         18 Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), TEx.

Unrecovered Costs\n        As explained in the interim order, the meaning of \"costs unrecovered as a result of\nimplementation of the CGS program tariff,\" as used in PURA § 39.452(b), was the subject of the\nApril 19, 2012 hearing. In the proposal for decision, the ALJ found that ETI is entitled to collect\nunrecovered embedded generation costs and any other related base rate costs as a result of\ncustomer migration to the CGS program.t9\n\n        ETI argued that unrecovered costs should be defined as the embedded production costs\nand any other related base rate costs that would have been recovered through traditional rates\ncharged to CGS customers that will no longer be recovered due to the CGS program. 2' TIEC\ntook the position that unrecovered costs should not include ETI's hypothetical lost revenues and\nthat the costs that could be unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff should include\nthe expenditures actually incurred by ETI to implement and maintain the CGS program.21 Cities\nand OPUC agreed with TIEC that unrecovered costs are not the same thing as unrecovered\nrevenues.22 Cities also noted that it would be unreasonable to allow ETI to continue to incur\ncosts for a customer the utility no longer plans to serve.23\n\n        In making its determination of the definition of unrecovered costs, the Commission\nfollows the precedent set in CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC v. Pub. Util. Comm 'n,\n354 S.W.3d 899 (Tex. App-Austin, 2011 no pet.) where the Third Court of Appeals found that\nbecause the language of PURA § 39.905 did not specifically provide for recovery of \"lost\nrevenues\" and that in at least two other provisions of PURA24 the legislature expressly\n\n\n\n        19 Proposal for Decision at 22 (Oct. 5, 2010).\n        20 Supplemental Direct Testimony, Exhibits, and Workpapers of Phillip R.

Such unrecovered costs do not include lost\nrevenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs. The Commission reverses the\nproposal for decision on this issue.\n\n\n                   B. May 17, 2013 Stipulation and Settlement Agreement\n        The Commission adopts the May 17, 2013 stipulation and settlement agreement in part,\nand rejects the settlement in part.\n\n        Under the terms of the stipulation, the parties agreed on issues relating to a CGS credit\namount, a fixed cost contribution fee, unserved energy, a termination payment, a force majeure\nclause, the Entergy Operating Committee, and MISO. Those issues are covered under findings\nof fact 53A-H. Under the stipulation, decisions regarding the CGS cost rider were to be deferred\nuntil no earlier than six months after the CGS rider became effective. The Commission adopts\nthe stipulation except for the portion of the stipulation that would defer decisions regarding the\nCGS cost rider. The Commission elects to make those decisions now rather than deferring them,\nand no party at the open meeting objected to this proposal.\n\n\n                                        C. CGSC rider\n1. Retroactive Recovery of Historical Costs\n\n       ETI proposed to recover the costs it incurred since November 10, 2010 related to the\nCGS program.26 TIEC's version of the CGSC rider would permit ETI to be able to recover the\nincremental, reasonable, and necessary CGS program implementation and administration costs\n\n       25\n            CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC v.

Cost Recovery if the CGS program is unsubscribed\n\n        ETI proposed that if the CGS program is unsubscribed, the CGSC rider rate would apply\nto the classes that are eligible to participate in the program.29 Commission Staff agreed with ETI\nand noted that even if the costs incurred to implement the program are de minimis because there\nare no subscribers, ETI would still be entitled to recover those costs under PURA § 39.452(b).3o\nOPUC agreed with ETI and Commission Staff.31 TIEC urged the Commission to defer this issue\nuntil the facts are not speculative in order to balance the twin charges of the statute of allowing\nETI to recover any costs that are unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff and\nensuring that the tariff is not implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or\ncompetitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of the CGS program.32\n\n       The Commission finds that ETI should be allowed to recover CGSC rider costs in the\nevent that there are no subscribers to the CGS program, because PURA § 39.452(b) entitles ETI\nto recover those costs. The Commission finds that those costs should be borne by the customer\nclass that the program was designed to benefit-the LIPS and LIPS-TOD customers-the\ncustomers that are eligible to participate in the program. The Commission adopts the language\nproposed by ETI on this issue in Section III of the redlined tariff.\n\n\n\n\n       27 TIEC's Initial Brief at 21-24.\n       28 Commission Staff's Initial Brief at 6-7 (March 1, 2013).\n       29 ETI's redlined tariff version Exhibit DRR-SD-6 at 1, Section III Rate.\n       3 0 Commission\n                       Staff s Initial Brief at 7 (March 1, 2013).\n       31 OPUC's Reply Brief at 12 (March 20, 2013).\n       32 TIEC's Initial Brief at 24-25 (March 1, 2013).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                     Order                              Page 10 of 27\n\n\n3. Interest\n\n        Citing PURA § 39.452(b), that ETI should be allowed to recover any costs unrecovered\nas a result of implementing the tariff, ETI requested recovery of interest on the unrecovered\nbalance of the CGSC rider charges.33 TIEC noted that the CGSC rider would be periodically\nadjusted to reflect ETI's actually incurred costs, so there would be no need for ETI to accrue\ninterest on any unrecovered balance.\n\n        The Commission finds that not allowing interest would be consistent with the treatment\nof rate-case expenses, which are typically amortized over a three-year period without a return on\nthe unamortized balance.34 ETI should not be permitted to recover interest on the unrecovered\nbalance of the CGSC rider charges.\n\n4. CGSC rider costs recovered in rate-base offset\n\n        OPUC argued that the interim order is clear that the costs to implement the CGS program\nare to be borne only by CGS customers. However, $299,372 was included in ETI's base rates\nfor costs related to the CGS program and will be paid by all retail customer classes.            OPUC\nrecommended that the same amount that is being recovered from all retail customers in base\nrates for CGS costs be recovered solely through the CGSC rider. Since the LIPS class is being\ncharged $49,192 per year in base rates, OPUC recommended that the CGS rider should be\nreduced by $49,192 to prevent double-recovery and that the remainder that is being recovered in\nretail base rates, $249,960, should be refunded directly to each class in the amount allocated in\nbase rates.35\n\n        TIEC took the position that OPUC was attempting make a collateral attack on the\nCommission's order in ETI's rate case.                  Furthermore, TIEC argues that ETI should not be\nrequired to conduct OPUC's proposed \"offset\" for the same reason that ETI should not be\n\npermitted to include costs incurred since November 2010-the costs are not costs to implement\nthe CGS program.36\n\n\n\n\n        33 ETI's Initial Brief at 24 (March 1, 2013).\n       34 TIEC's Initial Brief at 25 (March 1, 2013).\n       35 OPUC's Initial Brief at 3-7 (March 1, 2013).\n\n       36 TIEC's Reply Brief at 17-18 (March 20, 2013).\n\f PUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                        Page 11 of 27\n\n\n         ETI proposed to credit the CGSC rider with $299,372 to recognize amounts that were\nused in setting ETI's current base rates. This amount represents the amount of CGS-related costs\nthat ETI is already recovering in base rates pursuant to the Commission's order in ETI's most-\nrecent rate case, Docket No. 39896.37\n\n         The Commission agrees with TIEC on this issue and goes further to state that to permit\nan offset to the CGSC rider for amounts already included in rates may be retroactive ratemaking.\n\n5.       Amount to be recovered in the CGSC rider\n\n         The Commission does not reach the issue of the amount to be recovered for the\nimplementation and administration costs at this time because the amount cannot be known until\nETI actually implements the program.\n\n\n\n                                             IV.      Conclusion\n         The Commission adopts each of the stipulation and settlement agreements except for\nsection II.B.2 of the May 17, 2013 stipulation, and finds that unrecovered costs for the CGS\nprogram are those needed to implement and administer the CGS program and are not lost\nrevenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs. The Commission finds that\nETI should not be able to recover any costs via the CGSC rider until the CGS program is\nimplemented, that ETI should be allowed to recovery CGSC rider costs in the event that there are\nno subscribers to the CGS program, that ETI should not be permitted to recover interest on the\nunrecovered balance of the CGSC rider charges, and that ETI should not be required to conduct\nOPUC's proposed \"offset.\"\n\n\n\n\n         37 Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates, Reconcile Fuel Costs, and Obtain\nDeferred Accounting Treatment, Docket No. 39896, Order (Sept. 14, 2012).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                               Order                                      Page 12 of 27\n\n\n\n                                         V.

As part of its application in Docket No. 37744, Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for\n        Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, ETI proposed a competitive\n         generation service ( CGS) program pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act. Tex. Util.\n         Code Ann. (PURA) § 39.452(b).\n\n2.       On July 16, 2010 and July 20, 2010, a State Office of Administrative Hearings\n         administrative law judge held a hearing on the merits on ETI's CGS proposal.\n\n3.      A proposal for decision was issued on November 1, 2010.                     The ALJ ultimately\n        recommended that the CGS proposal be rejected.\n\n4.      The Commission considered the proposal for decision at the November 10 and\n        December 1, 2010 open meetings as part of docket No. 37744. At the December 1, 2010\n        open meeting, the Commission adopted the settlement for the rate case issues and severed\n        the CGS proposal into this Docket. The Commission requested that the parties enter into\n        negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined issues as\n        possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\n        the Commission for consideration.\n\n5.      Order No. 1 was issued on December 3, 2010 severing the CGS issues into this docket,\n        including the record in Docket No. 37744.\n\n6.      Sabine Cogen, LP filed a motion to intervene in this docket on December 23, 2010. ETI\n        filed an objection to Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene on December 30, 2010.\n        Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene was denied in Order No. 3 on January 12, 2011.\n\n7.      ETI, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Industrial Energy\n        Consumers, State Agencies, Kroger Co., Cities,38 Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and\n        Sam's East, Inc., and Cottonwood Energy are parties to this proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n        38 The cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Groves, Houston, Huntsville,\nMontgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches,\nRose City, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                            Order                                   Page 13 of 27\n\n\n8.     On January 11, 2011, the Commission AU issued Order No. 2 requiring ETI to either\n\n       provide an update on the status of settlement discussions or to propose a schedule, agreed\n       to by all parties, for finalizing the outstanding issues.\n\n9.     The parties filed status reports on January 13 and 28, February 18, March 11, and\n       April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that they\n       thought that they could narrow the issues.\n\n10.    On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\n       a motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket. TIEC and\n       Commission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion.\n       At the September 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and\n       issued an order requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that\n       have been settled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could\n       not be reached. The parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent\n       upon the Commission's determination of the unsettled issues.\n\n11.    On November 1, several parties filed an agreed list of settled issues.            TIEC also\n       separately filed a list of unsettled issues and request for procedural schedule. TIEC also\n       requested that the Commission receive additional evidence in order to resolve the\n       unrecovered costs issues because ETI's proposal in Docket No. 37744 was based on\n       ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and capacity-based program.\n       The circumstances had changed primarily due to the agreement of the Entergy Operating\n       Committee to treat CGS power from qualifying facilities in the ETI service territory as\n       firm generation. The remainder of the parties filed a joint agreed list of unsettled issues\n       and issues contingent on a Commission determination of unsettled issues.\n\n12.    At the December 8 and December 15, 2011 open meetings, the Commissioners decided\n       that the parties should submit stipulated facts, the Commission would re-open the record\n       to admit additional evidence as requested by TIEC, and then the Commission would\n       make a decision on the three threshold unsettled issues in an interim order.\n\n13.    On December 18, 2011, Order No. 4 was issued establishing a procedural schedule.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                             Order                                    Page 14 of 27\n\n\n14.    On January 20, 2012, the parties submitted agreed settlement terms and stipulated facts.\n\n       The parties reached agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within the\n       overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs.             Many of the items were simply\n       elements of larger program issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects\n       essential to final resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in\n       principle existed were \"subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.\"\n\n15.    On January 24, 2012, Order No. 5 was issued clarifying the number of copies of\n       testimony that were to be filed by the parties.\n\n16.    On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                           On\n       February 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\n       February 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.\n       The parties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n17.    Order No. 6 was issued on February 1, 2012 setting April 19, 2012 as the date for the\n       hearing.\n\n18.    On April 13, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation that to the extent there are\n       costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be\n       borne solely by customers taking service under the CGS tariff. ETI did not join but did\n       not oppose the stipulation.\n\n19.    On April 18, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation regarding customer\n       eligibility. LIPS customers will be eligible to participate in ETI's CGS program (with\n       further limitations as set forth in the stipulation on this issue).\n\n20.    The Commission held the hearing on the merits on April 19, 2012, and issued an interim\n       order on June 12, 2012 that adopted the unopposed issues and ruled that the types of costs\n       that will be considered ETI's unrecovered costs for purposes of PURA § 39.452(b) are\n\n       those costs necessary to implement and administer the CGS program and are not to be\n       defined to include lost revenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs.\n\n21.    Subsequent to the interim order, the parties continued discussions regarding how to\n       develop a CGS tariff (or tariffs) that would conform to the interim order rulings and\n      resolve other remaining contested issues.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                         Order                                   Page 15 of 27\n\n\n22.    On November 27, 2012, TIEC filed a motion to adopt a competitive generation services\n       program that included its proposed Rider Schedule CGS and Rider Schedule CGSC, the\n       latter of which addressed ETI's recovery of its costs of implementing and administering\n       the CGS program. TIEC's motion also addressed a number of issues that the parties had\n       not been able to resolve, and asked that the Commission rule in TIEC's favor on those\n       remaining contested issues.\n\n23.    On December 4, 2012, ETI filed a response to TIEC's November 27 motion. ETI's\n       response addressed the same contested issues raised by TIEC and asked the Commission\n       to rule in favor of ETI's position. ETI's response also included its own versions of the\n       CGS and CGSC riders (based on its positions on the contested issues), plus a redlined\n       version of both riders that compared TIEC's versions to ETI's versions.\n\n24.    On January 7, 2013, in response to a motion filed by TIEC, the Commission issued a\n       procedural schedule that required parties to file supplemental testimony in support of\n       their positions later in January and early February, and that parties were to indicate, on\n       February 8, 2013, whether a hearing was necessary. Interested parties filed supplemental\n      testimony in accordance with that schedule, and no party requested an evidentiary\n      hearing.\n\n25.   On February 19, 2013, the Commission issued an agreed briefing schedule which called\n      for parties to file a joint motion to stipulate testimony and RFIs into the record on\n      February 25, and for parties to file initial and reply briefs on March 1 and 20,\n      respectively, which briefs were filed by ETI, TIEC, Staff, OPUC, and Cities.\n\n26.   On May 8, 2013, TIEC filed a letter stating that TIEC and ETI had reached a preliminary\n      agreement on the remaining disputed issues and asked that this matter be deferred to the\n      next open meeting.      All parties indicated their agreement with the deferral.      The\n      Commission deferred consideration until the May 23, 2013 open meeting.\n\n27.   On May 17, 2013, ETI filed a stipulation and settlement agreement, which was supported\n      by TIEC and Staff, but with Staff taking no position on Sections II.B.1 and 2 of that\n      settlement.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                  Page 16 of 27\n\n\n28.     On May 17, 2013, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart filed a Joint Statement of Opposition to\n\n        the May 17 settlement. Their opposition was limited to Section II.B. of that settlement\n        and pertained to the proposed delay in deciding certain issues before the Commission,\n        including which customer classes should pay for costs recovered through the CGSC rider\n        in the event there are no CGS program subscribers, and the treatment of CGS project\n        code costs \"embedded\" in ETI's base rates in accordance with the Commission's order in\n        Docket No. 39896.\n\n29.     TIEC filed a response to the Joint Statement of Opposition on May 21, 2013.\n\n30.     OPUC, Kroger and Wal-Mart filed a joint reply to TIEC's response on May 22, 2013.\n\n31.     The Commission considered this matter at its May 23, 2013 open meeting, at which it\n        voted to accept in part and reject in part the May 17 settlement.\n\nElisible customers stipulation\n32.     The parties agreed that only customers eligible to take service under ETI's Large\n        Industrial Power Service (LIPS) are eligible customers for the CGS program.\n\n33.     The parties agreed that only LIPS firm load will be eligible to participate in the CGS\n        program.\n\n34.     The parties agreed that LIPS customers with interruptible service (IS) or standby and\n       maintenance service (SMS) load are not precluded from participating in the CGS\n       program, but this participation is limited to their firm LIPS load.   To the extent that\n       customers with IS load participate in the CGS program, they must comply with the terms\n       of the IS tariffs regarding minimum LIPS load. Only the portion of the customer's LIPS\n       load that is in excess of the firm contract power minimum requirement under section 1 of\n       Schedule IS is eligible for the CGS program.\n\n35.    The parties agreed that to the extent there are increased administration costs associated\n       with billing a customer that has CGS and IS or SMS load, the CGS customer will bear the\n       costs.\n\n36.    The parties agreed that there will be a 115 MW cap on the CGS program.\n\n37.    The parties agreed that there will be a 5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                            Order                                    Page 17 of 27\n\n\n38.    The parties agreed that there will be no aggregation of CGS customer load to meet the\n\n       5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\n39.    The parties agreed that there will be a cap of 10 CGS purchase agreements.\n\nCustomers responsible for nayinQ unrecovered costs stipulation\n\n40.    The parties, except ETI, agreed that to the extent there are costs unrecovered as a result of\n       the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be borne solely by customers\n       taking service under the CGS tariff, i.e., CGS customers.          ETI did not oppose this\n       stipulation.\n\nJanuary 20, 2012 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\n\n41.    In the CGS stipulated matters and stipulated facts filed on January 20, 2012, the parties\n       stated they had reached an agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within\n       the overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs, which were listed in\n       Section I. A-G of the stipulation. However, many of those items were simply elements of\n       larger program issues that retained one or more unsettled aspects essential to final\n       resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in principle existed,\n       subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues, included the following:\n\n       A.      Eligible CGS suppliers\n\n               1.      Eligible CGS suppliers will be limited to qualifying facilities that are or\n       will be directly connected to ETI.      Any expansion of eligible CGS suppliers would\n       require initiation of new Commission proceedings.\n\n       B.      Amount of CGS capacity\n\n               1.      A CGS customer will specify the amount of its load to be served by a\n       specified CGS supplier.\n\n               2.      The specified CGS supplier will enter into a contract with Entergy\n       Services, Inc., on behalf of ETI, or directly with ETI, for the purpose of becoming an\n       Entergy system network resource. The agreement between the CGS supplier and Entergy\n       Services, Inc. or ETI shall include a contract for the purchase of capacity and energy\n       (CGS purchase agreement). Per determination of the Entergy Operating Committee, the\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                  Order                                          Page 18 of 27\n\n\n         capacity and energy contracted for under the CGS purchase agreements shall be allocated\n\n         solely to ETI.\n\n                  3.      The level of capacity contracted for under the CGS purchase agreement\n         (CGS contract capacity) will be the same level of capacity contracted for in a separate but\n         related contract between the CGS supplier and the CGS customer.\n\n                 4.       The monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be calculated monthly based on\n         the on-peak energy deliveries of CGS-supplied energy from the CGS supplier.                          The\n         monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be the lesser of the CGS contract capacity and the\n         result of the following calculation-on a rolling 12-month basis (using a cumulative basis\n         during the first 11 months), the sum of the CGS-supplied energy delivered by the CGS\n         supplier during on-peak hours, divided by the number of on-peak hours during the same\n         time period, divided by 0.8.         On-peak hours are defined as the hours ending 7:00 am\n         through 10:00 pm Monday through Saturday, excluding North American Electric\n         Reliability Corporation holidays.\n\n         C.       CGS-customer unbundled rate\n\n                  1.      CGS customers are limited to, and will remain, ETI retail customers.\n\n                  2.      ETI will not make a capacity payment to the CGS supplier, and the CGS\n         customer will not pay ETI the embedded production cost in the firm rate schedule under\n         which the customer would otherwise be eligible to receive service.\n\n                  3.      The price for retail delivery service, including necessary ancillary\n         services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive generation\n         tariff will be a rate that is unbundled from ETI's cost of service and that will be\n         determined by a credit to the CGS customer's bill based on the unbundled production\n         costs associated with the otherwise applicable firm rate.\n\n                 4.       The unbundled, embedded production cost for a LIPS customer based on\n         current rates is $6.84 per kW per month.39 The CGS credit is subject to review and\n        modification in subsequent rate cases. If the clause \"less any corresponding concurrent\n\n\n         39 The parties subsequently agreed to set this amount at $6.50 per kW per month until rates are changed in\nETI's next base rate case (that is, the next base rate case after May 16, 2013). Finding of Fact No. 53A.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Order                                  Page 19 of 27\n\n\n       reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer\" referenced in section F.1 below is\n\n       adopted, then certain parties may recommend a further adjustment to the LIPS embedded\n\n       production cost specified in this paragraph C.4.\n\n               5.      With the exception of the capacity credit and fixed fuel factor, a CGS\n       customer will pay ETI a retail rate that includes all other charges the customer would pay\n       as a firm customer (for example Rider TTC, HRC, SRC, SRO, and IFF charges, if\n       applicable).\n\n       D.      CGS energy payment\n\n               1.      CGS customers will pay fuel costs based on avoided cost for\n       CGS-supplied energy. Specifically, ETI will purchase hourly CGS energy supplied by\n       the CGS supplier from the CGS contract capacity at the system hourly avoided-energy-\n       cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF. ETI will charge the CGS customer at the\n       same rate for that hourly CGS-supplied energy not to exceed the energy requirement of\n       the CGS customer.\n\n       E.      CGS customer fixed-cost contribution\n\n               1.      The level of compensation to ETI from CGS customers for CGS service\n       will include a monthly fixed charge called a fixed-cost contribution.\n\n               2.      The fixed-cost contribution will be $1.10 per kW of CGS load per month.\n\n               3.      Revenues from the fixed-cost contribution will reduce any otherwise\n       unrecovered costs associated with the program.\n\n       F.      CGS customer unserved energy rate\n\n               1.      If, in any hour in a delivery month, there is hourly CGS unserved energy,\n       the CGS customer will take service from ETI under the CGS unserved energy rate.\n       Hourly CGS unserved energy is the difference in any given hour between the amount of\n       energy corresponding to the full amount of CGS contract capacity and the amount of\n       energy actually supplied to ETI from the CGS contract capacity by the CGS supplier in\n       such hour, not to exceed the energy requirement of the CGS customer. The parties have\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                    Page 20 of 27\n\n\n\n       not agreed whether the following clause should be added to this last sentence: \"less any\n       corresponding concurrent reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer.\"40\n\n               2.       The structure of the CGS unserved energy tariffed rate will include an\n       agreed energy charge and agreed O&M adder. The monthly CGS unserved energy\n       charge will be the sum of (a) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times 105%\n       of the system hourly avoided energy cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF and\n       (b) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times specified variable O&M charges\n       specified immediately below in paragraph 3.\n\n                3.      The specified variable O&M charges for the CGS unserved energy rate are\n       as follows:\n\n         Delivery Voltage                         On-Peak Per kWh               Off-Peak Per kWh\n\n         Distribution (less than 69kV)            $0.03555                      0.00540\n\n         Transmission         (69kV      and      $0.02451                      0.00222\n         greater)\n\n                4.       On-peak and off-peak hours for the CGS unserved energy rate are as\n       follows:\n\n                         a.      Summer: On-peak hours are 1:00 pm to 9:00 pm Monday through\n       Friday of each week beginning on May 15 and continuing through October 15 of each\n       year except that Memorial Day, Labor Day and Independence Day (July 4 or the nearest\n       weekday if July 4 is on a weekend) are not on-peak.\n\n                        b.       Winter: On-peak hours for each week of Monday through Friday\n       beginning October 16 and continuing through May 14 of each year are 6:00 am to\n       10:00 am and 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm, except that Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and\n       New Year's Day (or the nearest weekday if the holiday should fall on a weekend) are not\n       on-peak.\n\n\n\n\n       40 The parties subsequently agreed that this quoted language would be added.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Order                                   Page 21 of 27\n\n\n                       c.     Off-peak hours are all hours of the year not specified as on-peak\n       hours.    With the approval of the Commission, ETI may at its sole discretion change\n       on-peak hours and season from time to time.\n\n                5.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from the variable\n       O&M charges will go towards offsetting any unrecovered costs as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS tariff.\n\n                6.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from 105% of the\n       system hourly avoided energy charges will go towards offsetting ETI's eligible fuel costs.\n\n       G.       Recognition of CGS supply as firm capacity.         Progress has been made on\n       resolving issues regarding the recognition of CGS capacity as firm capacity, but final\n       resolution of these issues, including the following, is contingent on the Entergy Operating\n       Committee's approval as well as a final resolution of all issues.\n\n                1.     The Entergy Operating Committee has established certain conditions that\n       must be met before it will recognize a CGS purchase agreement as \"capability\" for the\n       Entergy System, for purposes of determining reserve equalization payments or receipts.\n       The parties are continuing to discuss the conditions established by the Operating\n       Committee.\n\n                2.     The capacity product from CGS purchase agreements will be a 24/7\n       unit-contingent product.\n\n                3.     The delivery term of CGS purchase agreements may be from one year to\n       five years, and must be a whole number of years.\n\n                4.     The contract capacity will be a fixed capacity amount throughout any\n       successive 12-month period during the contract term.\n\n                5.     The parties have tentatively agreed to a number of concepts for firming up\n       CGS capacity that would be reflected in a form contract for use in implementing the CGS\n       program. The parties will continue to negotiate other concepts and terms for inclusion in\n       a form supply contract.\n\n42.    The parties stipulated that the Strategic Resource Plan (SRP) for the Entergy system (of\n       which ETI is a part) projects a continuing need for additional capacity for ETI and the\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                  Page 22 of 27\n\n\n       Entergy system through 2017. Entergy's and ETI's resource needs are subject to change\n\n       at any time based on actual experience related to operational conditions, resource offers\n\n       and solicitations, and other events that affect resource needs.\n\n43.    The parties stipulated that based on an assessment of load requirements and generating\n       capability, the SRP projects that ETI has an incremental net resource deficiency of\n       260 MW in 2012 and 504 MW in 2013.\n\n44.    The parties stipulated that the Entergy system-wide planning process is conducted\n       pursuant to the requirements of the Entergy system agreement and is designed to result in\n       a portfolio of resources that differ by term and source. The Entergy system agreement\n       states that the objective of this process is to ensure cost-effective, reliable levels of\n       service.\n\n45.    The parties stipulated that CGS purchase agreements are resources that will be included\n       in the Entergy System's portfolio of supply resources, consistent with the terms and\n       conditions related to the delivery requirements of those purchase agreements (e.g., degree\n       of dispatchability, term, degree of firmness).\n\n46.    The parties stipulated that it is reasonable at the outset of the CGS program to establish a\n       cap on the amount of load that may subscribe to CGS service.\n\n47.    The parties stipulated that the range of the cap should be between 80 MW and 150 MW.\n\n48.    It is reasonable to adopt the three unopposed 2012 stipulation and settlement agreements\n       regarding customer eligibility for the CGS program; the customers responsible for paying\n       for unrecovered costs; the capacity deficit; and the program cap.\n\nUnrecovered costs\n\n49.    PURA § 39.452(b) provides for the utility to be able to recover any costs unrecovered as\n       a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\n50.    In CenterPoint, the Third Court of Appeals found that because the language of\n       PURA § 39.905 did not specifically provide for recovery of \"lost revenues\" and that in at\n       least two other provisions of PURA the legislature expressly distinguishes \"costs\" from\n       \"revenues,\" the term \"costs,\" as used by the legislature in PURA § 39.905, is not\n       intended to include lost revenues.       Like PURA § 39.905, PURA § 39.452(b) only\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                      Page 23 of 27\n\n\n       provides for \"costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff' and does not\n\n       specifically provide for the utility to recover lost revenues or any other type of costs.\n\n51.    The Commission finds that the costs that will be unrecovered as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS program tariff are the costs to implement and administer the\n       CGS program tariff.\n\nThe May 17, 2013 Stipulation and Settlement Agreement\n\n52.    The May 17 settlement addresses the remaining contested issues that were not resolved\n       through the 2012 stipulation and settlement agreements and the interim order.               The\n       substantive provisions of the May 17 settlement address the CGS rider, the CGSC rider,\n       and appeal rights.\n\n53.    Agreements as to CGS Rider:\n\n       A.        CGS Credit: The parties agree to a CGS credit set at $6.50 per kW/month until\n       rates are changed in ETI's next base rate case.\n\n       B.        Unserved Energy: The parties agree to accept TIEC's proposed CGS rider tariff\n       language in the Second Supplemental Direct Testimony of Jeffry Pollock, which will\n       allow a CGS customer to attempt to decrease its load to match a decrease in deliveries by\n       the CGS supplier and thereby avoid unserved energy charges to the extent the CGS\n       customer's CGS load is reduced.\n\n       C.        Termination Payment:    The parties agree to remove ETI's proposed liquidated\n       damages provisions from the CGS rider and deal with liquidated damages provisions in\n       the supplier contract negotiations. The amount of liquidated damages, if any, received by\n       ETI shall be used to offset any capacity costs incurred by ETI to replace the lost CGS\n       supply.\n\n       D.        The Tracking Certificate:      The parties agree to remove ETI's proposed\n       prioritization provisions in Section G(5) and H from the tracking certificate (leaving them\n       to contract negotiations) and delete the provisions that would require the CGS customer\n       to provide what TIEC deemed \"competitively sensitive\" information.\n\n       E.        Force Majeure:   The parties agree to remove TIEC's proposed force majeure\n       provision.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                         Order                                   Page 24 of 27\n\n\n       F.      The Entergy Operating Committee: The parties agree to remove the following\n\n       ETI-proposed \"reservation\" provision from the CGS rider:\n               In addition, entering into new ETI-Supplier Contracts under the CGS\n               Program (i.e., ETI-Supplier Contracts that have not already been entered\n               into by ETI in response to CGS Service requests) at any given time must\n               be consistent with the Entergy System's need for capacity. Capacity\n               resources associated with the CGS Program will receive no preferential\n               treatment, but will be considered as part of the Entergy System's planning\n               process on the same basis as other potential capacity resources.\n               Recognition of the capacity component of the CGS Program on an\n               ongoing basis is contingent on periodic Entergy Operating Committee\n               conclusion that ETI requires the capability that would be obtained through\n               this program component.\n\n\n               ETI shall have the right by notice to the applicable customer, to deny or\n               terminate a request for CGS Service at any time prior to entering into the\n               ETI-Supplier Contract corresponding to such request if the limitations in\n               the penultimate paragraph of § I above apply ...\n\n\n               The following clause in Rider CGS Section III.B.3 of ETI's proposed\n               Rider CGS is modified as follows: Unless a CGS Service request is earlier\n               denied or terminated according to tariff provisions (or provisions of law)\n               applicable to the CGS Service ...\n        G.     MISO: The parties agree that ETI's proposed RTO/MISO provision will stay in\n        the CGS rider, but the phrase \"it will be necessary or appropriate to include [MISO terms\n        and conditions]\" is changed to \"it may be appropriate to include [MISO terms and\n        conditions).\"\n\n        H.     $1.10 Fixed Cost Contribution Fee: The parties agree that this fee will not be\n        applied as an offset to CGS administration and implementation costs.\n\n54.     Agreement as to CGSC Rider:\n\n        A.     ETI has agreed that an application for the CGSC rider will be filed with the\n        Commission no earlier than six months after the CGS rider becomes effective.\n\n        B.     Section II.B.2. in the May 17, 2013 settlement was challenged by OPUC, Kroger,\n        and Wal-Mart, with Cities also supporting resolution of the issues in Section II.B.2. now,\n        rather than deferring them as proposed in the May 17, 2013 settlement.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Order                                    Page 25 of 27\n\n\n       C.      Other than Section II.B.2, no other sections of the May 17 settlement were\n       opposed by OPUC, Kroger, Wal-Mart, or Cities, and were supported by ETI, TIEC, and\n       Commission Staff. The Commission finds that those unopposed provisions in the May\n       17 settlement are reasonable and in the public interest.\n\n       D.      The record from the current CGS docket (Docket No. 38951) and from Docket\n       No. 37744 shall be incorporated into the record in the CGSC rider application docket.\n\n       E.      All parties agree that only the variable O&M portion of the unserved energy rate\n       should be used to offset the unrecovered implementation and administrative costs. Fuel-\n       related revenues from the unserved energy rate will offset ETI's fuel balance, and not be\n       used to offset unrecovered costs.\n\n       F.      There will be no changes to ETI's current base rates as a result of this proceeding.\n\n55.    Agreement as to Appeal Rights: The parties agree that ETI is not waiving its right to\n       appeal the Commission's final order to the courts on any issues that are not resolved by\n       settlement in this docket.    All parties reserve their rights under applicable state and\n       federal law.\n\n56.    Proposed CGS Program Tariff: The proposed CGS program tariff (the CGS rider), which\n       is attached to the May 17 settlement as Attachment 1, is agreed to by the parties and\n       represents the CGS program as set out in the preceding Findings of Fact.\n\n57.    The Commission makes the following findings regarding the five issues within Section\n       II.B.2. of the May 17 settlement:\n\n       A.      The appropriate date upon which ETI is authorized to begin accruing CGS\n       program implementation and administration costs is the date that the CGS Rider\n       implemented.\n\n       B.      In the event there are no subscribers to the CGS program, it is reasonable and\n       appropriate for unrecovered implementation and administration costs accrued to the\n       CGSC rider will be charged to the LIPS and LIPS-TOD customers, the customer class\n       that the program was designed to benefit.\n\n       C.      It is not appropriate for ETI to recover interest on the unrecovered balance of the\n       CGSC rider charges.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                     Page 26 of 27\n\n\n       D.      It is not appropriate for there to be an offset to the CGSC rider for amounts\n       included in rates in Docket No. 39896.\n\n       E.      The Commission declines to address at this time the amount to be recovered as\n       implementation and administration costs because such amount is not known at this time.\n\n\n\n                                     V1.    Conclusions of Law\n1.     The Commission has jurisdiction and authority over this proceeding pursuant to PURA\n       §§ 14.001 and 39.452(b).\n\n2.     PURA § 39.452(b) does not allow for the recovery of lost revenue or embedded\n       generation costs.\n\n\n\n                                  VII.     Ordering Paragraphs\n1.     The Commission adopts each of the three stipulation and settlement agreements filed on\n       January 20, 2012, April 30, 2012, and April 18, 2012.\n\n2.     The Commission adopts each of the provisions of the stipulation and settlement\n       agreement filed on May 17, 2013, except for section II.B.2, pertaining to deferring\n       decisions on issues related to (a) the date ETI uses to start accruing implementation costs,\n       (b) whether rider CGSC will also recover interest on unrecovered costs, (c) whether any\n       historical costs billed to the CGS project code that are currently in base rates should be\n       removed from base rates, credited, and recovered through rider CGSC, and (d) who pays\n       if there are no subscribers. Those issues are resolved as set forth in this order.\n       Accordingly, the Commission adopts in part and rejects in part the May 17 settlement as\n       set forth in this order.\n\n3.     The CGS rider, attached to the May 17 stipulation and settlement agreement, is approved\n       as of the date of this order. ETI shall file a clean CGS rider tariff in this docket within 10\n       days of the date of this order.\n\n4.     In the event there are no subscribers to the CGS program, unrecovered implementation\n       and administration costs accrued to the CGSC rider will be charged to the LIPS and\n       LIPS-TOD customers, the customer class that the program was designed to benefit.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                    Page 27 of 27\n\n\n5.         ETI is not authorized to recover interest on the unrecovered balance of the CGSC rider\n           charges.\n\n6.         There shall be no offset to the CGSC rider for amounts included in rates in Docket\n           No. 39896.\n\n7.         The Commission declines to address at this time the amount to be recovered as\n           implementation and administration costs because such amount is not known at this time.\n\n8.         The date upon which ETI is authorized to begin accruing CGS program implementation\n           and administration costs is the date that the CGS Rider is implemented.\n\n9.         ETI shall not file an application for the CGSC rider earlier than six months after the CGS\n          rider becomes effective. ETI shall file an application for the CGSC rider in accordance\n          with the agreement approved by this order.\n\n10.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES AND REQUEST FOR PROCEDURAL SCHEDULE\n\n        TIEC's list of unsettled issues in Section II below reflects the common language that has\nbeen agreed upon by the parties to identify the remaining unsettled CGS issues. The parties have\nworked in good faith to identify the remaining contested issues related to implementation of a\nCGS program. The parties were not able to agree on the procedures for resolving these contested\nissues, however, and thus are filing separate pleadings. While TIEC believes that it may be more\nexpeditious for the Commission to take up all of the unresolved issues at once, TIEC is not\nopposed to the other parties' preference to have the Commission first address certain preliminary\ncontested issues, if the Commission so desires. Preliminary issues could include the following:\n\nA.      Unrecovered Costs\n\n         In TIEC's view, this issue dwarfs all others and has been the primary impediment to a\nworkable CGS program from the outset. The position of TIEC (and others) at the hearing in this\nmatter during the summer of 2010 was that Entergy had not shown that there would be any\nunrecovered costs (other than potential administrative costs) as a result of the CGS program.\nEntergy, on the other hand, indicated that there would be a substantial amount of unrecovered\ncosts, at one point asserting that it could be as much as $75 million. The potential magnitude of\nthat issue is substantially reduced given the parties' progress on (1) a cap on the CGS program\nand (2) procedures to firm up the capacity provided by CGS suppliers so that it would be counted\nas firm capacity by the Entergy system. Nonetheless, the dispute remains concerning whether\nthere would be any unrecovered costs and, if so, the amount.\n\n\n                                                                                            2l\nAUS 647538.3\n\f        The CGS statute essentially provided that retail customers who choose to take CGS\nservice would pay an unbundled rate for transmission and ancillary services, but would obtain\ntheir generation from a competitive source.' ETI would purchase electricity from the identified\nsource and provide it to the CGS customer. TIEC's position has been that Entergy would be\nfully compensated for the unbundled transmission and ancillary services through the CGS rate,\nand Entergy would be fully compensated for the cost of the electricity by the CGS customer\npaying the full cost of the electricity bought on its behalf from the CGS supplier. Entergy's\nposition, on the other hand, has been that it would suffer lost revenues that it would otherwise\nreceive if the CGS customer were a full bundled customer, and that Entergy's other customers\nshould be required to pay Entergy for those lost revenues.\n\n        If the Commission desires to resolve this issue as a preliminary matter, the Commission\nshould receive limited additional evidence. The pre-filed testimony submitted in this case in late\n2009 or early 2010 no longer accurately reflects the facts, and the Commission should base its\ndecision on the actual facts as they exist today.       Notably, the evidentiary record that was\ndeveloped in Docket No. 37744 was based on ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an\nenergy and capacity-based program as reflected in the parties' list of settled issues. TIEC does\nnot anticipate that additional evidence would be lengthy, and it is possible that the parties could\nstipulate to key facts rather than submit testimony. In any case, the items on which the\nCommission would need evidence include the following:\n\n               •   The Entergy Operating Committee's recognition that, assuming certain\n                   conditions are met, capacity provided by a CGS supplier could be counted as\n                   system capacity, thereby reducing Entergy's capacity requirements.\n               •   The value of the capacity provided by the CGS supplier.\n               •   The fact that ETI's load growth since base rates were set is greater than the\n                   proposed capped amount of CGS load. As a result, the CGS program as capped\n                   would not result in any reduction in generation-related revenues for ETI, but\n                   would simply reduce the amount of ETI's load growth.\n               •   Operational savings that would accrue to ETI's customers from firming up\n                   Qualified Facility (QF) energy puts by using them as a source of 24 by 7, base\n                   load capacity.\n               •   What impact, if any, joining MISO would have on a CGS program.\n\n\n'See PURA § 39.452(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\nAUS.647538.3\n\f        Key facts on the above issues are not in the record at this time, and TIEC submits that the\nCommission cannot make an informed decision in this case without them. Accordingly, TIEC\nwould request an opportunity for the parties to submit record evidence on these issues in the\nform of stipulated facts, facts administratively noticed, or testimony on limited issues.\n\nB.      Responsibility for Paying any Unrecovered Costs\n\n        If the Commission determines that there are no unrecovered costs, then this is not an\nissue. If, however, the Commission determines that there are unrecovered costs, then Entergy is\nentitled under the statute to recover any such costs and the Commission would have to determine\nhow any such costs will be recovered.\n\nC.      Eligible CGS Customers\n\n        There are issues about whether eligibility for CGS service should be limited to certain\nrate classes, as ETI proposed, or should be available to all customers who can meet the necessary\nmetering requirements, including customers who may aggregate load.\n\n        The parties differ on the issue of whether the unsettled issues can be resolved based on\nbriefing on the existing record or whether, in addition to briefing, it may be appropriate for the\nCommission to take administrative notice of certain facts and/or accept limited additional\nevidence relevant to the settled and unsettled issues. TIEC's position is that the Commission\nshould establish a procedural schedule that would allow the Commission to take notice of facts\nand/or accept limited additional evidence relevant to the CGS issues, as well as briefing.\n\n        The need for a procedural schedule to address evidentiary issues should be apparent from\nthe face of the parties' joint list of settled issues.   The Commission is currently faced with a\nsubstantially different CGS proposal than was originally proposed by ETI almost two years ago\nin Docket No. 37744. Further, considerable time has passed since the close of the record in\nDocket No. 37744, and the evidence that was developed in that record is now stale (e.g.,\nforecasted load growth since the test year). It is TIEC's position that the work and effort that the\nparties have put into developing a revised CGS proposal will result in a much better program\nthan the one proposed by ETI in Docket No. 37744. Because the parties did not develop the\nevidence with the current proposal in mind, however, additional evidence is necessary to provide\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\nAUS 647538.3\n\finformation to the Commission that it could not otherwise consider based on the existing\n\nevidentiary record.\n\nII.   LIST OF UNSETTLED ISSUES\n\n        TIEC identifies specific unsettled issues, as follows:2\n\nA.      Unrecovered Costs3\n\nB.       Who are eligible CGS customers\n\nC.       Who is responsible for paying for any unrecovered costs\n\nD.       Unresolved issues related to recognition of CGS supply as firm capacity include4:\n\n         1)       Terms and conditions necessary for the CGS program to comply with capacity\n                  planning and acquisition principles under the Entergy System Agreement\n\n         2)       CGS Supply Contract minimum size\n\n         3)       Whether CGS Customer aggregation should be permitted\n\n         4)       Cost responsibility for transmission upgrades\n\n         5)       Commercial CGS Supply Agreement terms and conditions\n\nE.       Cap on CGS load - the level of an overall cap on the amount of customer load that would\n         be included in the CGS program (i.e., 80MW to 150MW)5\n\nF.       Appropriateness of using load growth as an offset to any unrecovered costs\n\nG.       Capacity value of the CGS capacity product\n\n H.      CGSC costs:\n\n\n\n\n 2 These descriptions are meant to be high level, and do not include all the component issues which affect the\n controversy surrounding these matters.\n\n 3 The parties disagree as to whether this issue is: \"The definition and calculation of any unrecovered costs\" or\n instead \"the definition, existence, and calculation of any unrecovered costs.\" TIEC's position is that the latter\n description of the issue is appropriate.\n\n 4 ETI maintains that matters such as these listed in Section II A fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FERC.\n If ETI and the Parties can reach an agreed resolution of these issues, the jurisdictional question will be avoided.\n\n 5 ETI maintains that matters such as these fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FERC. If ETI and the Parties\n can reach an agreed resolution of these issues, the jurisdictional question will be avoided.\n\n\n\n                                                           4\n AUS 647538.3\n\f        1)     Recovery of CGSC costs should there be no CGS participants\n\n        2)     Determination of the appropriate starting date for incurring recoverable CGSC\n               costs\n\n        3)     Whether CGSC costs should earn carrying costs\n\n1.      Whether a form contract is required for the successful implementation of the CGS\n        program\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n        For the above reasons, TIEC requests that the Commission adopt a schedule to allow\nadditional evidence and briefing on the unsettled issues.\n\n\n\n                                                 Respectfully submitted,\n                                                 ANDREWS KURTH LLP\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Rex D.

O'Brien with ESI's System Planning and\n\n 8          Operations group (\"SPO\") will provide testimony supporting certain of the\n\n 9          issues I address.\n\n10\n\n11   Q.     WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE PURPOSE OF THE\n\n12          CGSPROGRAM?\n\n13   A.     The CGS program, as provided for in its enabling legislation and as\n\n14          currently being discussed by the parties to this proceeding, is intended to\n\n15          provide a specific subset of customers (\"CGS Customers\") with the ability,\n\n16          consistent with the requirements of federal law and FERC tariffs including\n\n17          the Entergy System Agreement, to obtain generation service from an\n\n18          alternative supplier. In order to accomplish this objective, to address the\n\n19          Commission's concerns regarding cost shifting under the program, and to\n\n20          address other significant limitations imposed by the legislation (including\n\n21          the requirement that the CGS program not create a conflict with Federal\n\n22          law), the parties to this proceeding have engaged in extensive\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                 Page 3 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           negotiations and arrived at a tentative solution to at least some aspects of\n\n 2           the CGS program design.\n\n 3                   Under this collaborative proposal, customers eligible for CGS\n\n4            service will contract with a CGS Supplier, which must be a Qualified\n\n 5           Facility (\"QF\") as defined by Rate Schedule LQF in ETI's service territory,\n\n6           for a negotiated level of CGS capacity (\"Supplier-Customer Contract\").\n\n 7           ETI will not be a party to this contract; however, the Supplier/OF (\"CGS\n\n 8           Supplier\"), based on the Supplier-Customer Contract, will then enter into a\n\n 9           CGS Purchase Agreement with the Company for the same level of\n\n10           capacity as in the Supplier-Customer Contract. The capacity supplied by\n\n11           the CGS Purchase Agreement will take the form of a 24/7 unit contingent\n\n12           product.     Upon fulfillment of other as-yet unresolved conditions in a\n\n13           manner satisfactory to the Entergy Operating Committee, that committee\n\n14           has agreed to recognize that the CGS Purchase Agreement can provide\n\n15           firm capacity (or, in the terms of the Entergy System Agreement,\n\n16           \"capability\") to the Entergy System. 2\n\n17                   ETI will not make a capacity payment directly to the CGS Supplier.\n\n18           Instead, ETI will provide a credit to the CGS Customer equal to ETI's\n\n     2\n         The parties to the case, including ETI, have not reached agreement on all matters necessary\n         to establishment of a CGS program that includes such a capacity product. Matters yet to be\n         unresolved are listed in the \"Agreed List of Unsettled Issues and Issues Contingent on a\n         Commission Determination of Unsettled Issues\" referenced earlier in this testimony. By\n         providing this testimony, ETI does not in any manner waive its rights to fully contest and\n         independently assert its rights regarding any and all matters that remain in dispute among the\n         parties. ETI presents this testimony solely for the purpose of facilitating the Commission's\n         resolution of the threshold issues listed above, which may facilitate further efforts by the\n         parties to resolve remaining contested issues surrounding the design of the CGS program\n         and tariffs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          embedded production cost (measured in $/kW/month) for that customer\n\n 2          times the CGS Supplied Capacity (kW). Any compensation for the CGS\n\n 3          capacity to the CGS Supplier is paid by the CGS Customer pursuant to\n\n 4          the terms of a separate Supplier-Customer Contract. The tentative terms\n\n 5          and conditions I have laid out here, among others, are included in Section\n\n 6          I of the CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts filed by the parties to\n\n 7          this proceeding on January 20, 2012.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.     IS THE INTENT OF THE CGS PROGRAM TO CREATE A CAPACITY\n\n10          MARKET FOR ETI?\n\n11   A.     No. The CGS program is not intended, or needed, as a means to fulfill\n\n12          ETI's resource needs and the Company would resist any effort to place a\n\n13          value on CGS capacity based on an alleged resource need for the\n\n14          program.      To the contrary, the CGS program, as I noted above, is\n\n15          designed as a means whereby a limited class of eligible customers could\n\n16          gain access to an alternative source of generation apart from that offered\n\n17          by ETI.\n\n18                  The Entergy system has and will continue to plan for and acquire\n\n19          short-term, limited-term and long-term resources needed by ETI to reliably\n\n20          serve its Texas customers.             However, if implemented properly and\n\n21          consistent with applicable legal requirements, the CGS program could\n\n22          provide a relatively modest amount of additional capacity for the Entergy\n\n\n\n                                                                                       l\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS (DEFINITION AND CALCULATION)\n\n 5   Q.          PLEASE PROVIDE AN OVERALL DEFINITION OF UNRECOVERED\n\n 6               COSTS.\n\n 7   A.          PURA § 39.452(b), which provides the statutory authority for the CGS\n\n 8               program, provides that \"The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be\n\n 9               considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and\n\n10               [ETI's] rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to\n\n11               recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the\n\n12               tariff.\" The statute's definition of unrecovered costs is broad: \"any costs\n\n13               unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\" There are two\n\n14               categories of costs within this statutory provision: 1) implementation and\n\n15               administration cost (\"lA Cost\") associated with this program - this would\n\n16               include the cost of any billing systems, administration cost of the program\n\n17               going forward, and any cost incurred to develop and implement the\n\n18               program in the first instance; and 2) unrecovered costs (\"Unrecovered\n\n19               Costs\") that results due to CGS Customers no longer taking firm service\n\n20               from the Company. The lA Cost and its recovery is not one of the three\n\n21               threshold issues and will not be addressed in this testimony.\n\n22                      Unrecovered Costs should be defined as the embedded production\n\n23               costs and any other related base rate costs that would have been\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

These are costs that the\n\n 3           CGS Customers would have paid under their traditional rate schedules if\n\n 4           they had not switched to the CGS program.           Because these customers\n\n 5           have switched to the CGS program, these embedded production costs\n\n 6           (less any potential offsets) would otherwise be unrecovered by ETI due to\n\n 7           implementation of the CGS program.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.      IS THIS DEFINITION OF THE STARTING POINT FOR UNRECOVERED\n\n10           COSTS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF UNRECOVERED\n\n11           COSTS      RECOGNIZED          IN THE     INITIAL EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\n12           REGARDING THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n13   A.      Yes.     In his Proposal For Decision, the ALJ reached the following\n\n14           conclusion regarding the nature of unrecovered costs:\n\n15                          The ALJ agrees with ETI that PURA § 39.452(b)\n16                   requires that \"the utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding\n17                   in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs\n18                   unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff,\"\n19                   and that the CGS legislation specifically authorized the\n20                   Company to recover any unrecovered costs as \"a result of'\n21                   implementation of the CGS program. ETI is entitled to\n22                   collect unrecovered embedded generation costs and\n23                   any other related base rate costs as a result of customer\n24                   migration to the CGS program. 3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          Docket No. 37744 (now severed into Docket No. 39851),Proposal for Decision (\"PFD\") at\n          p. 22 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                                                             q\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                         Page 7 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n\n\n1               Although the ALJ believed that there might be offsets to these\n\n2               unrecovered costs, he was clear in his recognition of embedded test year\n\n3               generation costs as the starting point for the measurement of unrecovered\n\n4               costs.\n\n 5\n\n6    Q.         WOULD       IT BE APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT A               DEFINITION        OF\n\n7               UNRECOVERED COSTS LIMITED TO WHAT YOU REFER TO ABOVE\n\n 8              AS THE lA COSTS?\n\n 9   A.         No, it would not. When ETI's rates are set in a base rate proceeding, the\n\n10              level of those rates is expressly determined so as to be sufficient to\n\n11              recover the reasonable and necessary production-related costs (including\n\n12              return on investment) that it incurred in a representative test year,\n\n13              adjusted for known and measureable changes. Those rates are further\n\n14              designed so that each of the Company's customers' rates contributes their\n\n15              share of those costs, consistent with principles of cost causation. As the\n\n16              ALJ stated, \"the ALJ agrees that ETI's revenue requirement is based on\n                                                                             4\n17              and designed to recover such [embedded production] costs.\"\n\n18                       When, for example, a Large Industrial Power Service (\"LIPS\")\n\n19              customer shifts part of its load to CGS service, it avoids payment of the\n\n20              share of ETI's embedded test year production costs allocated to it when\n\n21              base rates were set, because that load is now served through the CGS\n\n\n     4\n          /d.\n\n                                                                                           fo\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                     Page 8 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1            program. If ETI must absorb this loss, then it has failed to recover a part\n\n 2            of its production costs that its base rates were designed to recover. The\n\n 3            effect is the same as if the Commission had granted that particular\n\n 4            customer a discount rate for a portion of the service. As a general rule,\n\n 5            PURA requires that the utility, rather than its customers, absorb losses\n\n 6            associated with discount rates. 5           As quoted above, however, PURA §\n\n 7            39.452(b) is an exception to this rule, and expressly prohibits the CGS\n\n 8            program tariffs from being treated as offering a discount rate.\n\n 9                    The Company does not support proposals that shift risks or losses\n\n10            onto ETI. Any such proposal results in only a small group of customers\n\n11            obtaining a benefit at the expense of the Company, which is nothing more\n\n12            than a discount rate in disguise.\n\n13\n\n14   Q.       HOW IS THE CGS RATE FOR CUSTOMERS STRUCTURED, BASED\n\n15            ON THE CGS PROGRAM DESIGN DISCUSSED BY THE PARTIES\n\n16            DURING THEIR SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS?\n\n17   A.       The proposed CGS program provides a $/kW credit for the amount of\n\n18            CGS capacity supplied by the CGS Customer. 6 The parties' January 20\n\n19            Stipulation affirms (Stipulation I.C.3) that this $/kW credit should be based\n\n20            on the embedded production cost from the most recent ETI general rate\n\n\n     5\n          PURA § 36.007.\n     6\n          This credit approach is different from the ETI proposal at the time of the initial CGS hearing to\n          implement unbundled rates and is administratively more efficient. See Section I.C of the\n          Stipulation of Facts and Other Matters filed January 20, 2012.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 9 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          case for the class of customers eligible to participate in the program. For\n\n 2          example, based on ETI's last full base rate case (Docket No. 37744), for\n\n 3          the LIPS rate class, this value is $6.84/kW as shown on Exhibit PRM-1.\n\n 4          Based on the Company's most recent filed base rate case in Docket No.\n\n 5          39896, again for the LIPS class, this value is $7.77/kW as shown on\n\n 6          Exhibit PRM-2. This $/kW credit recognizes that the CGS Customers will\n\n 7          be supplying a portion of their own production-related requirements via the\n\n 8          CGS supplied capacity and not receiving the generation supply associated\n\n 9          with ETI production costs for that amount of capacity supplied.\n\n10\n\n11   Q.     CAN YOU FURTHER DISCUSS WHY EMBEDDED PRODUCTION COST\n\n12          IS THE APPROPRIATE STARTING POINT FOR DETERMINING THE\n\n13          CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n14   A.     As I explained earlier, embedded production cost is the appropriate\n\n15          starting point because that is the amount that the CGS Customer will\n\n16          receive as a credit and will thereby avoid by taking some level of service\n\n17          under the CGS program, instead of continuing to take that level of service\n\n18          under its historical rate schedule. As described above, this credit is based\n\n19          on the embedded production cost incurred to serve that customer, and\n\n20          equates to the amount of contribution to fixed production costs previously\n\n21          provided by the CGS Customers, and thus is the starting point for\n\n22          calculating the CGS Unrecovered Costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                               Page 10 of 23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1   Q.      ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL OFFSETS TO THIS STARTING POINT\n\n 2           FOR DETERMINING UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n 3   A.      Yes.    The current CGS program proposal under discussion among the\n\n4            parties is based upon energy supplied via a firm 24/7 product as described\n\n 5           earlier in my testimony, and by ETI witness O'Brien.                     The Entergy\n\n 6           Operating Committee has indicated that such a product may, under\n\n 7           appropriate conditions, be included in ETI's generating capability for\n\n 8           purposes of the Entergy System Agreement accounting and resource\n\n 9           planning. Provided that remaining outstanding issues regarding \"firming\n\n10            up\" CGS capacity can be resolved in a manner that is consistent with the\n\n11            Operating Committee parameters, the amount of capacity associated with\n\n12           the CGS Supplier-Customer Contracts will -                     unlike the capacity\n\n13           associated with the initial CGS proposal originally filed in Docket No.\n\n14           37744 - be considered ETI capability in the determination of ETI's\n\n15            payments pursuant to Entergy System Agreement Service Schedule\n\n16            MSS-1 (Reserve Equalization). 7 The inclusion of CGS capacity in the\n\n17            calculation of ETI's Schedule MSS-1 obligations is expected to reduce\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          MSS-1 obligations are calculated by comparing an Entergy Operating Company's (\"OPCO's\")\n          owned or controlled capability to the amount of capability that an OPCO should own or\n          control if it owned or controlled an amount of capability equal to its share of the System's\n          load. A company that owns or controls less capability that it should be responsible for is\n          known as a \"short\" company, and is required to compensate those OPCOs that are \"long\" for\n          the use of the long Company's reserves. ETI is a short OPCO, which means that adding\n          capability that the Operating Committee has determined to be eligible to ETI's total company\n          capability will reduce ETI's MSS-1 payments.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          ETI's Schedule MSS-1 payments to the other OPCOs and, as such, will\n\n 2          reduce ETI's overall revenue requirement.\n\n 3\n\n 4   Q.     HAVE YOU CALCULATED THE EFFECT OF CGS CAPACITY ON ETI'S\n\n 5          SCHEDULE MSS-1 PAYMENTS?\n\n 6   A.     Yes. Exhibit PRM-3 shows the calculation of the effects of CGS capacity\n\n 7          on ETI's Schedule MSS-1 obligations, based on a recent Intra System Bill.\n\n 8          Under Schedule MSS-1, when capacity is added incrementally to the\n\n 9          system each OPCO is responsible for their responsibility ratio share of this\n\n10          capacity.    When an OPCO is adding capacity, in this case ETI adding\n\n11          CGS capacity, the OPCO is comparatively longer and thus reduces its\n\n12          Schedule MSS-1 obligation.           In this example, the reduction amounts to\n\n13          $3.097/kW/month and would be an offset to the CGS Unrecovered Costs\n\n14          starting point ($6.84/kW/month under current rates) discussed above.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.     ARE THERE ANY OTHER OFFSETS TO THIS UNRECOVERED COSTS\n\n17           STARTING POINT?\n\n18   A.     Yes.    Under the settlement terms tentatively agreed to by the parties,\n\n19          other offsets would be the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee and the Unserved\n\n20           Energy O&M adder charges set out in the parties' January 20 Stipulation\n\n21           (Stipulations I.E.1-3, I.F.5). The Fixed Cost Contribution Fee is a fixed\n\n22          $/kW fee per month that each CGS Customer will pay and for which the\n\n23           revenues received by ETI will go to offset the CGS Unrecovered Costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 12 of 23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          The Unserved Energy O&M adder is a fee the CGS Customers may or\n\n 2          may not pay depending on whether the CGS capacity was actually\n\n 3          supplied to ETI or not. Again, revenues received by ETI from this O&M\n\n4           adder will go to offset the CGS Unrecovered Costs.\n\n 5\n\n 6   Q.     OTHER PARTIES HAVE ARGUED THAT LOAD GROWTH SHOULD BE\n\n 7          AN OFFSET TO CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS. PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n 8   A       It has been suggested previously that revenues associated with load\n\n 9          growth should be an offset to unrecovered costs. Such a suggestion is\n\n10          inconsistent with the provision of the law that states: \" ... and [ETI's] rates\n\n11          shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any\n\n12          costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\" This\n\n13          language requires that the program be implemented within the base rate\n\n14          case in which the tariff is developed, in order that the embedded costs that\n\n15          are avoided by the CGS Customer would be readily identifiable.            Load\n\n16          growth is not a concept that can be appropriately applied within the\n\n17           context that rates are set in Texas based upon an historical test year with\n\n18           known and measureable costs.              Load growth adjustments have gained\n\n19           acceptance in Texas in some instances as a consideration in offsetting\n\n20           incremental costs, and should not be used to offset the embedded costs\n\n21          we are dealing with in this case.\n\n22                  Also, as referenced above, unrecovered costs are costs that would\n\n23           have been recovered but for the CGS program or \"as a result of the\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                   Page 13 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          implementation of the tariff.\" Load growth is not dependent on the CGS\n\n 2          program and would have occurred regardless of the CGS program.\n\n 3                  In addition, any potential offset associated with load growth would\n\n4           have to be limited to load growth associated with the generation function.\n\n 5          Any load growth associated with the distribution function, for example,\n\n 6          would be earmarked for the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (\"DCRF\") in\n\n 7          accordance with the rules adopted to implement the DCRF. I would add\n\n 8          that load growth in the DCRF example is used to offset incremental costs\n\n 9          incurred since the last base rate case, not to offset embedded cost.\n\n10                  Lastly, any load growth adjustment to the Unrecovered Costs would\n\n11          also need to recognize that ETI's generation cost continues to increase.\n\n12          More specifically, simply adjusting for the effect of load growth on ETI\n\n13          revenues associated with the generation function would not recognize the\n\n14          other effects on the generation function such as cost increases.       The\n\n15          result of such an approach would be that revenues that would otherwise\n\n16          be available to offset increases in purchased power cost for customers,\n\n17          would instead be dedicated to the CGS program. The result of dedicating\n\n18          the growth in revenues to the CGS program would be the purchased\n\n19           power costs to be recovered from all customers, save for those taking\n\n20          CGS service, would increase. This inappropriate outcome further justifies\n\n21          the conclusion that load growth, to the extent it is utilized, should only\n\n22           offset incremental costs, and not embedded costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT WAS THE COMPANY'S EARNED ROE IN ITS LAST EARNINGS\n\n 2           MONITORING REPORT?\n\n 3   A.     The Earnings Monitoring Report for the calendar year 2010 showed the\n\n 4          Company's earned ROE was 7.22%, compared to an authorized return of\n\n 5           10.125%.\n\n 6\n\n 7   Q.      HOW DOES THE COMPANY'S EARNED ROE RELATE TO A LOAD\n\n 8          GROWTH ADJUSTMENT?\n\n 9   A.      If the Company is not earning its allowed ROE it should not be required to\n\n10          make a load growth adjustment.             Any load growth adjustment would\n\n11          simply further reduce the earned ROE below the allowed level. An earned\n\n12           ROE below the allowed ROE is an indication that the Company's cost has\n\n13          increased at a higher rate than any load growth or increase in sales.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.      IS THERE ANOTHER MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS\n\n16          THESE LOAD GROWTH AND COST INCREASE ISSUES?\n\n17   A.     Yes. In Project 39246, the Commission is considering the development of\n\n18           a purchased power recovery (\"PPR\") rider applicable to ETI and other\n\n19          Texas vertically integrated utilities.      The PPR rider envisioned by ETI\n\n20           recognizes the benefits of load growth because it reflects the total\n\n21           revenues collected by the PPR rider. Thus, if revenues collected from the\n\n22           PPR rider have increased due to increased sales, this increase would\n\n23           automatically be reflected in updates to the PPR rider via the over( under)-\n\n                                                                                      11\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          recovery provision, thus reducing the amounts customers would otherwise\n\n 2          pay for purchased power costs.\n\n 3                  In addition, ETI's envisioned PPR rider reflects the total purchased\n\n4           power cost8 of the Company, thus it would automatically reflect any\n\n 5          fluctuations (up or down) caused by increases or decreases in any\n\n 6          purchased power cost component via the over(under)-recovery provision.\n\n 7                  Due to the manner in which the PPR should function, if the\n\n 8          acquisition of CGS capacity truly reduces ETI purchases or reduces\n\n 9          MSS-1 payments made by ETI, these reductions would be reflected in the\n\n10          actual cost collected through the PPR rider and would not need to be\n\n11          separately identified and quantified. Likewise any debate on the value of\n\n12          load growth or its quantification as an offset would no longer be necessary\n\n13          because all increased revenues caused by the increased sales, whatever\n\n14          their level, would be reflected in the over/under recovery provision of the\n\n15           PPR rider.     For example, if sales increased by 5% and the purchased\n\n16          power cost decreased 3% in the same period, both of these effects would\n\n17           be reflected as reductions in the PPR rider, thereby automatically\n\n18           offsetting CGS Unrecovered Costs included in the PPR.                 This would\n\n19           eliminate any need to debate the extent to which CGS Capacity provided\n\n20          value that should offset CGS Unrecovered Costs, because any such value\n\n\n\n\n     8\n         The purchased power cost reflected in ETI's envisioned PPR rider would also include the\n         cost associated with Entergy System Agreement Service Schedule MSS-1.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

IS THERE ANY CAPACITY COST VALUE, OTHER THAN THAT\n\n 5          ASSOCIATED WITH SCHEDULE MSS-1, THAT CAN BE USED TO\n\n6           OFFSET THE CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n 7   A      No. As demonstrated in the forgoing discussion, an offset is appropriate\n\n 8          only if the CGS program results in an actual reduction to ETI's revenue\n\n 9          requirement.      Accordingly, there are no grounds for an additional offset\n\n10          other than those previously discussed.\n\n11                  Further, as discussed by ETI witness O'Brien, many factors and\n\n12          characteristics must be considered when valuing capacity costs, such as\n\n13          the lack of flexibility, energy cost, firmness (unit contingent vs. system\n\n14          contingent), term, size (level of MW), location and ability to reduce\n\n15          operating constraints (reduction of QF put). A review of the characteristics\n\n16          of the capacity that ETI will acquire as a result of the CGS program\n\n17          indicates that the CGS capacity is not a product that would reasonably be\n\n18          expected to have a high level of value.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     (j\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Using the LIPS rate class as an example (and which ETI proposes should\n\n 5           comprise the CGS-eligible customers),              Exhibit PRM-4 shows the\n\n 6           calculation of the net CGS Unrecovered Costs based on embedded cost\n\n 7           from Docket No. 37744 and ETI's filed case in Docket No. 39896 net of\n\n 8           the offsets I discussed above.

The Company proposes that the CGS Unrecovered Costs should be\n\n17           recovered from all non-CGS participating load.                  This is a slight\n\n18           modification from the Company's direct case position in which the\n\n19           Company was proposing that the CGS Unrecovered Costs should be\n\n20           recovered from all non-CGS customers. 9            This modification recognizes\n\n21           that there is a portion of a CGS Customer's load that is not supplied by the\n\n     9\n          See Docket No. 37744, Phillip R.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          CGS program and for which the Company continues to supply generation.\n\n 2          This non-CGS participating load should be treated as any other customer\n\n 3          load for which ETI supplies generation resources.\n\n 4                  As discussed by Company witness O'Brien in his supplemental\n\n 5          direct testimony, under appropriate conditions, CGS capacity can be\n\n 6          considered to be capability for ETI and the Entergy System. Therefore,\n\n 7           ETI's proposal for who should pay for Unrecovered Costs recognizes that\n\n 8          the proposed CGS firm capacity product is a generation resource, the cost\n\n 9          of which should be recovered from all customers.\n\n10\n\n11   a.     WHY SHOULD A NEW CUSTOMER, WHO DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO\n\n12          THE CREATION OF THE CGS PROGRAM, HAVE TO PAY FOR\n\n13           UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n14   A.     As stated above, the CGS capacity should be treated like any other supply\n\n15           resource and be recovered from all customers whether new or existing.\n\n16          Any other conclusion would imply that certain customer groups can select\n\n17           specific ETI generation resources to satisfy their needs. For example, this\n\n18          would imply that a new customer could elect to not pay for any River Bend\n\n19           Station    nuclear generation-related     costs   because   the   Company's\n\n20           acquisition of power from the River Bend Station was made and approved\n\n21           long before that customer became an ETI customer. Such a conclusion is\n\n22           contrary to traditional ratemaking whereby customers' rates are based on\n\n23           average cost pricing.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

SHOULD THE LOADS OF NEW CUSTOMERS, WHO ARE ALSO CGS\n\n2            CUSTOMERS,           BE     INCLUDED        IN    THE      CALCULATION          OF\n\n3            UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n4    A       Yes. But for the CGS program, a new customer would contribute to the\n\n 5           Company's embedded production fixed cost based on current base rates.\n\n6            However, because of the CGS program, the Company will not recover the\n\n 7           same level of fixed cost from the new customer had the CGS program not\n\n 8           been in effect.\n\n 9\n\n10                       V.      WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR CGS SERVICE\n\n11   Q.      WHAT IS THE COMPANY'S PROPOSAL FOR WHO SHOULD BE\n\n12           ELIGIBLE FOR CGS SERVICE?\n\n13   A       The Company continues to propose that only the LIPS class of customers\n\n14           be eligible for the CGS program. As stated in ETI's direct case, PURA\n\n15           § 39.452(b) is not intended to extend a competitive generation tariff\n\n16           offering to all customers. 10 The provision refers to \"eligible customers\"\n\n17           rather than to \"all customers.\" It is important to reiterate that the CGS\n\n18           program is not a provision for retail customer choice, or for a retail pilot\n\n19           project, as otherwise addressed in PURA Chapter 39.                     Given the\n\n20           complexity of the CGS program, it is appropriate to set reasonable\n\n\n     10\n          See Docket No. 37744, Phillip R. May Direct Testimony filed on December 30, 2009, pages\n          10-12, (Bates No. 3-261-263).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                               Page 20 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           eligibility thresholds for CGS service. Moreover, the statutory language's\n\n2           reference to protections for \"manufacturers\" who choose not to participate\n\n3           in the program suggests an expectation that this is the type of customer\n\n4           who otherwise will be participating. The Company continues to believe\n\n 5          that only large customers will have the size, sophistication, and capability\n\n6           to make use of the CGS service. Second, LIPS customers already have\n\n 7          the interval data recorder (\"lOR\") metering in place that is technically\n\n 8           required    for the     program.          Third,   the   administration   and   billing\n\n 9           requirements of the CGS program require a substantial amount of\n\n10           additional systems work and on-going manual intervention from the\n\n11           Company's Major Accounts Billing function.                  It cannot be easily or\n\n12           inexpensively expanded past a relatively small number of CGS Customers\n\n13           (customers/meters) without requiring a much larger system and personnel\n\n14           investment. Potentials for expanding the program beyond the LIPS class\n\n15           can be addressed in the annual reports to be filed by the Company but,\n\n16           until it is shown that expansion beyond that class is workable and\n\n17           appropriate, the eligible CGS Customers should be limited to the LIPS\n\n18           class.\n\n19\n\n20   Q.      COULD AGGREGATION ALLOW SMALLER CUSTOMERS TO QUALIFY\n\n21           FOR THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n22   A.      Theoretically, aggregation - by which I mean a group of customers\n\n23           pooling their load for purposes of utilizing CGS service - could allow such\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                Page 21 of 23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1              customers to qualify. However, as stated in the Company's direct case\n\n 2              and above, the CGS program is not intended to be retail open access. 11\n\n 3              Implementing the CGS program with aggregation across all customer\n\n 4              classes, or even just some classes in addition to the LIPS class, is\n\n 5              tantamount to retail open access, as there would be no limit on the retail\n\n 6              customers then \"eligible\" to participate in the choice of an alternative to\n\n 7              service from ETI. 12 In addition, on a more practical note, aggregation of\n\n 8              accounts raises complicated customer accounting and billing provisions. 13\n\n 9              The Company's billing system would require major modification or\n\n10              potential replacement in order to aggregate accounts depending on the\n\n11              number of accounts under the CGS program.                   Employee training on\n\n12              aggregation and the ultimate billing system will be required. The cost of\n\n13              any new billing system would have to be recovered from customers like\n\n14              any other implementation and administration cost for the CGS program.\n\n15              Moreover, certain provisions of this CGS program may require notification\n\n     11\n          /d.\n     12\n          Parties have agreed that it is reasonable at the outset of the CGS program to establish a cap\n          on the amount of load that may subscribe to CGS service. However, the parties have not\n          reached agreement on the amount of a cap beyond a range from 80 MW to 150 MW. See\n          Stipulation of Facts and Other Matters filed January 20, 2012 (Stipulation II.B. 1-2).\n     13\n          The Company is assuming that if aggregation were allowed, an aggregator would be required\n          to facilitate aggregation. The CGS product is a 24/7 firm product that requires the CGS\n          Supplier to acquire firm network service. Examples of the complications associated with\n          aggregation include: 1) if a customer who is part of a CGS aggregated group closes\n          business, does this result in the entire aggregated group's CGS contract being terminated\n          because the firm network resources no longer matches the aggregated groups CGS\n          capacity?; 2) how can, or should, customers be added to an aggregate group because this\n          would then exceed the existing CGS capacity and contracted firm network transmission\n          service?; 3) how can the requirement for IDR metering and backup metering for each CGS\n          Customer at their cost be fulfilled in the context of aggregation?; and 4) how would all such\n          CGS Customers be converted to calendar month billing?\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ARE THERE ANY OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO ELIGIBILTY THAT\n\n6            SHOULD BE ADDRESSED?\n\n7    A.     Yes.    As discussed in Company witness O'Brien's supplemental direct\n\n 8           testimony, it is appropriate to limit the number of CGS Supplier-Customer\n\n 9           Contracts that can be in effect at any point in time, or to set a minimum\n\n10           contract size for each CGS Supplier-Customer Contract.            Lastly, as\n\n11           discussed above and as described in the parties January 20 Stipulated\n\n12           Matters and Stipulated Facts, this CGS program is extremely complicated.\n\n13           The Company therefore proposes that customers currently on either the\n\n14           Rider to Rate Schedule LIPS for Interruptible Service (\"Schedule IS\") or\n\n15           Economic As-Available Power Service (\"Schedule EAPS\") should not be\n\n16           allowed to participate in the CGS program to satisfy any portion of their\n\n17           firm load at this time.      Customers on Schedules IS and EAPS already\n\n18           have their loads split between firm and other service. Adding a further\n\n19           split of what was firm service between CGS and what then remains for\n\n20           firm service is a further complexity in billing and administration of the CGS\n\n21           program that should be considered at a future date, once the Company\n\n22           and its customers have the opportunity to gain experience in the basics of\n\n23           the CGS program.

Page 3 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1   A.     Mr. Nalepa and Mr. Pollock take the position that the Company is seeking\n\n 2          recovery of \"lost revenues,\" and that lost revenues are not the same as\n\n 3          unrecovered costs.\n\n 4\n\n 5   Q.     MR. POLLOCK (PP. 18-19) AND MR. NALEPA (P. 8) CLAIM THAT\n\n 6          COURT        AND      COMMISSION             PRECEDENTS      HAVE    ALREADY\n\n 7          REJECTED         THE     COMPANY'S           POSITION   IN   THIS    CASE    BY\n\n 8          CONCLUDING THAT UTILITIES ARE NOT ENTITLED UNDER PURA TO\n\n 9          RECOUP \"LOST REVENUES.\" WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE?\n\n10   A.     Mr. Nalepa does not provide any indication of what precedent he is\n\n11          referencing, so I am not in a position to respond to his contention. Mr.\n\n12          Pollock references several Commission proceedings dealing with the\n\n13          promulgation of the Commission's energy efficiency rule, and a court case\n\n14          reviewing certain aspects of that rule.         Mr. Pollock contends that these\n\n15          precedents establish a principle that references to recovery of costs in\n\n16          PURA do not contemplate recovery of lost revenues.\n\n17                  Before I turn to rebuttal of Mr. Pollock's suggestion, I note that\n\n18           neither the Commission Staff nor the SOAH ALJ who was the first\n\n19          impartial judge of these issues had any trouble concluding that ETI's\n\n20          proposal was for the recovery of unrecovered embedded production\n\n21          costs. The Staff, which has not indicated any change in position at this\n\n22          juncture, concluded: \"[i]mplementing the CGS tariff...              allows CGS\n\n23          customers to avoid certain generation-related costs, and therefore PURA\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                   Page 4 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          § 39.452(b) permits ETI to recover these unrecovered costs.\"2 Similarly,\n\n2           the ALJ concluded: \"ETI is entitled to collect unrecovered embedded\n\n3           generation costs and any other related base rate costs as a result of\n\n4           customer migration to the CGS program.\"3\n\n 5                   As for Mr. Pollock's arguments in his Supplemental Direct\n\n6           Testimony, I am not a lawyer and do not intend to debate the merit of\n\n 7          Mr. Pollock's testimony as legal analysis per se. His analysis, however, is\n\n 8          irrelevant and off base because the Company in this proceeding seeks\n\n 9          only its statutory right to recoup the fixed production costs that it fails to\n\n10           recover when a customer chooses CGS service over firm LIPS service.\n\n11          The Company's production costs to serve all of its customers are\n\n12           determined in a base rate case based on a representative test year (most\n\n13           recently in Docket No. 37744), and every customer's share of those costs\n\n14           are likewise determined in that same case. The Company's production\n\n15           costs for the LIPS customers in Docket No. 37744 is $6.84/kW-month.\n\n16           When one of those customers moves to CGS service, the Company no\n\n17           longer recovers that $6.84 unit production cost from that customer; in the\n\n18           words of the CGS statute, that cost is \"unrecovered.\" Mr. Pollock points to\n\n19           the fact that ETI's proposed CGSUSC tariff uses the term \"lost revenues\"\n\n20           rather than \"unrecovered costs.\" This difference in terminology is of no\n\n\n     2\n         Docket No. 37744, Staff Reply to Exceptions at p. 3. .

Under PURA\n\n15          § 36.007, if a utility grants a discount rate, it must absorb the \"allocable\n\n16          cost of serving those customers ... \" who receive the discount.         If ETI\n\n17          cannot recover the production costs avoided by the CGS customer, it will\n\n18          absorb the portion of its production costs \"allocable\" to those customers,\n\n19          just as is required when a utility provides a customer with a discount rate.\n\n20          PURA § 39.452(b}, however, expressly prohibits the CGS program from\n\n21          producing this result.\n\n\n\n     4\n         See PURA § 39.905.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK'S DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC, HE\n\n 2          REFERS TO \"HYPOTHETICAL\" LOST REVENUES.                          IS THERE\n\n 3          ANYTHING            HYPOTHETICAL             ABOUT      THE     COMPANY'S\n\n4           UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n 5   A.     No. The Company's calculation of unrecovered costs is based on\n\n 6          embedded costs within the rate case establishing the CGS tariff as\n\n 7          prescribed by PURA § 39.452(b).              The only unknown is whether any\n\n 8          customers will actually apply for CGS service. Hence, the Company has\n\n 9          developed a $/kW rate associated with its known embedded costs that\n\n10          would be applied to actual CGS load as it occurs to determine the CGS\n\n11          unrecovered costs. There is nothing hypothetical about this cost. The\n\n12          same cannot be said for load growth, which may or may not occur in the\n\n13          future.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.     YOU MENTION LOAD GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.                        WHAT ABOUT\n\n16           LOAD GROWTH SINCE THE LAST RATE CASE?\n\n17   A.     The Company has already filed a new rate case. Any growth in load since\n\n18           rates were set in the last rate case (Docket No. 37744), along with any\n\n19          growth in cost. will be taken up in the rate new case (Docket No. 39896).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE LOAD GROWTH PROPOSALS MADE BY\n\n 3           THE OTHER PARTIES.\n\n 4   A.      Mr. Townsend recommends that unrecovered costs be reduced by any\n\n 5           increases in generation-related base rate revenues attributable to load\n\n 6           growth. 5 It appears that, under Mr. Townsend's approach, an allocation of\n\n 7           ETI's overall revenues from load growth would need to be made, yielding\n\n 8           the proportion of the growth reasonably attributable to the generation\n\n 9           function. Mr. Johnson recommends that unrecovered costs be offset by\n\n10           production revenue growth for the LIPS class only. 6\n\n11                   Similar to Mr. Townsend, Mr. Nalepa states that load growth \"from\n\n12           existing production-related rates charged to incremental load\" should form\n\n13           the basis for ETI to recover the production costs previously paid by the\n\n14           CGS customer?         Mr. Chriss makes no recommendation regarding load\n\n15           growth in Wai-Mart's February 10, 2012 direct testimony.                 Mr. Pollock\n\n16           suggests that ETI has experienced load growth that exceeds unrecovered\n\n17           costs and therefore there are no unrecovered costs. 8 For this discussion it\n\n18           appears that Mr. Pollock is utilizing total company growth for the\n\n\n     5\n          Townsend Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, pages 81ines 19-21.\n     6\n          Johnson Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, page 15, lines 5-7.\n     7\n          Nalepa Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, page 8, line 22 to page 9, lines\n          1-2.\n     8\n          Pollock Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, pages 21-24.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   \\0\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ARE      THERE        COMMON         FLAWS       IN   THE    LOAD     GROWTH\n\n5           RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INTERVENOR WITNESSES?\n\n6    A.     Yes, the intervenor witnesses uniformly ignore that ETI's unrecovered\n\n 7          costs (the embedded production costs associated with serving CGS\n\n 8          customers) are determined in a base rate case, using test year rate setting\n\n 9           principles, just like every other element of the Company non-fuel\n\n10           production costs.     The Commission does not consider incremental load\n\n11           growth or other incremental cost or revenue changes outside the rate year\n\n12           in establishing the rates that will recover ETI's fixed production costs for\n\n13           any other component of those costs.             There is no basis for taking a\n\n14           contrary approach in determining recovery of the embedded production\n\n15           costs associated with serving the CGS customers.             PURA § 39.452(b)\n\n16           confirms this view when it states that \"the utility's rates shall be set, in the\n\n17           proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs as a result\n\n18           of the implementation of the tariff.\"         The statute says nothing about\n\n19           considering a load growth adjustment that is unknown and unmeasurable\n\n20           as the Commission sets rates, in this case, to recover the production costs\n\n21           incurred to serve CGS customers.            Furthermore, even if the statute did\n\n22           refer to load growth, changes in costs to serve customers, not just growth\n\n23           in load, would also need to be considered.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 9 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n\n\n 1   Q.     ARE THERE ADDITIONAL FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN INTERVENOR\n\n 2          WITNESS LOAD GROWTH ANALYSES?\n\n 3          Yes, the intervenor witnesses' load growth recommendations are\n\n 4          fundamentally       flawed     for   additional   reasons.   All   of   these\n\n 5          recommendations assume, to one degree or another, that load growth\n\n 6          under base rates is to be devoted, in a preferential fashion, to subsidize\n\n 7          the CGS program. There is nothing in base ratesetting principles or in\n\n 8          PURA that supports this approach. Under PURA, absent special statutory\n\n 9          requirements to the contrary, base rates are to be set sufficient to\n\n10          providing the utility with a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable\n\n11          return over and above the recovery of its reasonable and necessary\n\n12          operating expenses.\n\n13                  Once those base rates are set, they are left in place until such time\n\n14          as they are changed again, on a prospective basis only. There is nothing\n\n15          in this process that earmarks load growth for a special purpose, such as\n\n16          subsidizing the CGS customers.\n\n17                  The Commission Staff has explicitly recognized this principle in this\n\n18          case. In its Exceptions to the ALJ's Proposal for Decision, ETI explained\n\n19          that devoting load growth to address unrecovered costs would prevent it\n\n20          from using such growth to address costs of operations it actually\n\n21          experienced while the rates were in effect. The Staff agreed, stating in its\n\n22          Replies to Exceptions that:\n\n\n                                                                                     \\I-\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1                    [l]oad growth could be accounted for in a manner that would\n 2                    keep ETI's shareholders whole. The CGSUSC Rider [for\n 3                    recovering unrecovered costs] could be designed in such a\n 4                    manner that only the amount of load growth related revenue\n 5                    in excess of the amount of load growth related revenue\n 6                    equal to ETI's costs would go toward offsetting the\n 7                    unrecovered costs non-CGS participants would have to pay. 9\n 8\n 9   Q.      ARE      YOU     AWARE        OF    OTHER          INSTANCES   IN   WHICH   THE\n\n10           COMMISSION HAS APPLIED TOTAL COMPANY OR GENERATION-\n\n11            RELATED REVENUE GROWTH AS AN OFFSET TO EMBEDDED\n\n12            HISTORICAL COSTS SUCH AS THE CGS CUSTOMER PRODUCTION\n\n13            COSTS?\n\n14   A.       No. As discussed in my Supplemental Direct Testimony, load growth has\n\n15           gained acceptance in Texas as a consideration in offsetting incremental\n\n16           costs, as in the provision for periodic adjustments for incremental changes\n\n17            in distribution investment, 10 but should not be used to provide a means for\n\n18           the non-recovery of embedded costs without consideration of incremental\n\n19           costs.\n\n20\n21   Q.       IF ONE ASSUMED, PURELY FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, THAT A\n\n22            GENERATION LOAD GROWTH ADJUSTMENT WERE APPROPRIATE\n\n23           TO OFFSET UNRECOVERED COSTS, IS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE\n\n\n\n\n     9\n          Staff Reply to Exceptions at p. 4 (emphasis added).\n     10\n          PURA Sec. 36.21 O(a)(2).\n\n\n                                                                                         \\~\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

No. If load growth from all customers classes associated with generation\n\n 4          revenues were used to offset the CGS unrecovered costs then: 1) this\n\n 5          load growth would not be available to offset incremental generation cost in\n\n 6          the context of the pending purchased power rulemaking; and 2) other\n\n 7          non-CGS classes of customers would be further subsidizing the CGS\n\n 8          program because load growth attributable to their classes would be used\n\n 9          to offset CGS unrecovered costs for a program that only benefits CGS\n\n10          participants.    Mr. Pollock's Exhibit JP-4 illustrates these problems.   His\n\n11          illustration shows that ETI' five-year projected load growth is 73.6 MW.\n\n12          But the load growth that he calculates is necessary to offset unrecovered\n\n13          costs (68.7 MW based on ETI's currently pending rate case) uses up\n\n14          virtually all the ETI projected load growth.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.     ON PAGE 16, MR. JOHNSON DISMISSES THE COMPANY'S USE OF\n\n17          THE EARNINGS MONITORING REPORT (\"EMR\") EARNED RETURN\n\n18          ON EQUITY (\"ROE\") AS AN INDICATION THAT LOAD GROWTH HAS\n\n19          NOT OFFSET INCREASED COSTS. PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n20   A.     Mr. Johnson at first states that this report is not indicative because it does\n\n21          not include the unrecovered costs of the CGS program (there are no CGS\n\n22          participants currently). First, this statement is inaccurate. The EMR does\n\n23          include the embedded production costs currently being used to satisfy\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

In addition, this statement\n\n 2           misses the Company's point. Regardless of the potential criticisms of a\n\n 3           particular EMR, it well illustrates the general concept that if the Company\n\n4            is not earning its allowed ROE, then the Company's non-fuel cost must\n\n 5           have increased at a faster rate than load and its associated revenues\n\n 6            have grown. The other parties continue to focus on growth in revenues\n\n 7           but ignore the fact that the Company's cost is also increasing.                     For\n\n 8           example, Mr. Pollock's Exhibit JP-2 indicates that adjusted energy sales\n\n 9            have increased by 5.9% in the two years between the test year in ETI's\n\n10            last rate case (the twelve months ending June 30, 2009) and the test year\n\n11            in the currently pending rate case (the twelve months ending June 30,\n\n12            2011). 11   ETI's non-fuel generation costs, however, have increased by\n\n13            28.6% in the same time frame. Load growth cannot be claimed or utilized\n\n14           to recover both incremental cost and embedded cost. 12 This would simply\n\n15            be double counting load growth.\n\n16                    Lastly Mr. Johnson indicates that the EMR is a general diagnostic\n\n17           tool and does not reflect all of the adjustments that would be made in the\n\n18            context of a rate case.         A general diagnostic tool is precisely how the\n\n19            Company utilized this report.          It provides a general indication that the\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          Pollock Exhibit JP-2, line 2, last column shows 5.9% increase in sales.\n     12\n          LIPS non-fuel generation revenue requirement of $65.251 million from Exhibit PRM-1, line 14\n          compared to $83.890 million from Exhibit PRM-2, line 3.

ON PAGE 22, MR. POLLOCK DISCUSSES THE AMOUNT OF LOAD\n\n5            GROWTH THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED. DO YOU HAVE ANY\n\n6            COMMENT?\n\n7    A.      Yes.   Mr. Pollock asks the Commission to simply assume that the load\n\n 8           growth forecast by ETI will in fact come to pass, although it is plainly not a\n\n 9           known or measurable event at this point.         Based on that speculative\n\n10           assumption, he asks the Commission to decree for now and ever after that\n\n11           ETI will have no unrecovered costs because load growth will outstrip\n\n12           them. This is an unreasonable and unsupportable assumption, to say the\n\n13           least, as Mr. Pollock's own exhibits demonstrate. The workpaper to Mr.\n\n14           Pollock's Exhibit JP-2 shows the actual known and measurable growth in\n\n15           ETI load over the period 1999 - 2009. Using that data, I have calculated\n\n16           the increase from each year to the year 2009, along with the compound\n\n17           annual growth for each year to 2009 as shown in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \\1\n\f    Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK DESCRIBES HIS BELIEF THAT\n\n 2          PROJECTED LOAD GROWTH MORE THAN OFFSETS ETI'S CLAIMED\n\n 3          \"LOST REVENUES.\" PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n 4   A.     Mr. Pollock simply assumes 150 MW of CGS customer load, then\n\n 5          estimates the unrecovered costs based on both values from Docket\n\n 6          No. 37744 and from Docket No. 39896 provided by the Company, then\n\n 7          backs into the amount of load growth that would be required to offset\n\n 8          these unrecovered costs based on the embedded production cost values\n\n 9          provided by the Company. This analysis exhibits several flaws. First, as\n\n10          discussed above, Mr. Pollock's example greatly overstates the amount of\n\n11          load growth that may reasonably be considered available to subsidize the\n\n12          CGS program.        A more reasonable allocation of load growth would be\n\n13          based on the percentage of load growth attributable to the LIPS class that\n\n14          should be determined to be the class eligible for the CGS program.\n\n15                  Second, Mr. Pollock's analysis fails to recognize the impact load\n\n16          growth has on MSS-1 payments and ETI's capacity purchases. As ETI's\n\n17          load increases, its responsibility ratio increases for MSS-1 purposes.\n\n18          Therefore, ETI becomes a \"shorter\" company and, as a result, incurs\n\n19           increased MSS-1 payments.             In addition, ETI will incur incremental\n\n20          capacity costs to serve this hypothesized load growth not currently\n\n21           reflected in the embedded cost rate assumed by Mr. Pollock. Thus, Mr.\n\n22           Polllock has overstated the effect load growth would have as an offset to\n\n23           unrecovered costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF SITUATIONS\n\n 2          WHERE HE HYPOTHESIZES THAT NEW LOAD ASSOCIATED WITH\n\n 3          CGS CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT RESULT IN UNRECOVEVRED\n\n 4          COSTS. PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n 5   A.     As discussed above and in my Supplemental Direct Testimony, PURA\n\n 6          provides that \"... [ETI's] rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the\n\n 7          tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the\n\n 8          implementation of the tariff.\"       As discussed in my Supplemental Direct\n\n 9          Testimony, new load is subject to the same average cost pricing as\n\n10          existing load.     Accordingly, in the normal course of events, new loads\n\n11          would pay their share of ETI's embedded production costs in the same\n\n12          manner as existing customers. Mr. Pollock's position assuming that these\n\n13          new customers would not have paid these costs absent the CGS program\n\n14          would require: 1) a decision by the Commission to treat a portion of ETI's\n\n15          new load differently from other new load not associated with the CGS\n\n16          program; and 2) would require credible proof that absent the CGS\n\n17          program, this load would never have been added to ETI's system. Absent\n\n18          this proof, this load is like any other new or existing load subject to\n\n19          average cost pricing.         Like much of Mr. Pollock's presentation, his\n\n20          scenarios are purely hypothetical and theoretical.          The facts and\n\n21          circumstances surrounding a new customer taking service from ETI, or an\n\n22          existing customer expanding its load, cannot be judged until such an event\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Accordingly, these scenarios form no legitimate basis for making\n\n 2           a determination regarding the level of ETI's unrecovered costs.\n\n 3\n\n 4                     V.

PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE PARTIES' POSITIONS REGARDING WHO\n\n 6           SHOULD PAY (OR BE ALLOCATED) THE CGS UNRECOVERED\n\n 7           COSTS.\n\n 8   A.      Mr. Townsend recommends that: 1) unrecovered costs should be\n\n 9           recovered from CGS participants, and if that option is not viable; 2) the\n\n10           CGS program should be rejected, and if that option is not selected;\n\n11           3) ETI's proposal to spread these costs across all classes is the most\n\n12           equitable (with certain modifications). 13 Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nalepa and Mr.\n\n13           Chriss recommend that the unrecovered costs should be recovered from\n\n14           the LIPS class of customers (both CGS participants and non-participants)\n\n15           because only the LIPS customers have an effective ability to participate in\n\n16           CGS and this is consistent with cost causation principles. 14 Mr. Pollock\n\n17           recommends that unrecovered costs (if any) should be recovered from\n\n18           CGS participants. 15      Mr. Pollock also suggests that if the unrecovered\n\n\n\n\n     13\n          Townsend Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, pages 3-4 and pages 7-8.\n     14\n          Johnson Supplemental Direct Testimony, page 6, line 16 to page 7, line 2.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THESE PROPOSALS.\n\n 5   A.       Ultimately the question of what class of customers should pay for\n\n 6            unrecovered costs is a policy decision to be made by the Commission.\n\n 7            One thing that is clear under PURA § 39.452(b) is that the Company is\n\n 8            allowed to recover its unrecovered costs: \"[ETI's] rates shall be set, in the\n\n 9            proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered\n\n10            as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\" 17 The statute, however,\n\n11            does not dictate a specific allocation of unrecovered costs among ETI's\n\n12            customers. The Company would not oppose any reasoned allocation of\n\n13            unrecovered costs to customer classes including CGS participants or CGS\n\n14            eligible customers. That said, it should be understood that any allocation\n\n15            of unrecovered costs will be temporary in nature.      Ultimately, when ETI\n\n16            files another base rate case, the effects of the CGS program would be\n\n17            reflected in the allocation of cost responsibility similar to the way that the\n\n18            Company now allocates the interruptible credit.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n          ld, page 38, lines 11-13.\n     17\n          PURA § 39.452(b).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK'S STATEMENT\n\n 2          THAT SHOULD THE UNRECOVERED COSTS BE SUBSTANTIAL\n\n 3          THERE          WILL    BE     INSUFFICIENT    BENEFITS      TO     JUSTIFY\n\n 4          IMPLEMENTING THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n 5   A.     There is no aspect of the CGS program, as described in PURA\n\n 6          § 39.452(b), hinting that unrecovered costs should be ignored in order to\n\n 7          heighten the chance of the program's success for those relatively few\n\n 8          customers positioned to take advantage of it.      To accept Mr. Pollock's\n\n 9          implicit invitation to do so would be nothing less than creating an\n\n10          impermissible discounted rate for CGS customers that is financed by the\n\n11          Company's absorption of the embedded production costs incurred to\n\n12          serve those customers. As stated in PURA § 39.452(b) and described in\n\n13          my Supplemental Direct Testimony, the CGS program may not result in\n\n14          the creation of such a discounted rate.       The Company is allowed to\n\n15          recover its unrecovered costs, and the CGS program is optional to\n\n16          customers.      Satisfaction of the statutory requirements applicable to the\n\n17          CGS program, not guaranteed success for a select few customers, should\n\n18          be the basis for evaluating the CGS program and tariffs.\n\n19\n\n20                   VI.

Page 21 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1   A.      Mr. Townsend states that Kroger agrees with the Company that\n\n 2           participation should be limited to the LIPS customers. 18 OPUC witness\n\n 3           Mr. Johnson and Cities witness Mr. Nalepa state they agree to limiting\n\n4            CGS eligibility to the LIPS class and, to their knowledge, that LIPS\n\n 5           customers are the only class of customers actively pursuing CGS. 19\n\n 6           Mr. Chriss states that Wai-Mart does not support expanding the class of\n\n 7           eligible CGS customers beyond the LIPS class at this time. 20 Mr. Pollock\n\n 8           proposes that eligibility should be expanded to all customers having a\n\n 9           sufficient amount of 24n load. 21              Mr. Pollock also suggests that\n\n10           aggregation of customer load should be allowed in order for smaller\n\n11           customers to qualify for the CGS program?2 However, Mr. Pollock also\n\n12           concludes that the minimum CGS contract size should be 5 MW.                          He\n\n13           appears to make these recommendations without regard to whether such\n\n14           customers have any interest in or ability to effectively participate in the\n\n15           program.      Notably, in response to an RFI from ETI, TIEC could not\n\n16           produce a list of even just one of its members, or any other person, that\n\n17           has expressed an interest or intent to participate in the CGS program. 23\n\n\n\n     18\n          Townsend Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, page 5, lines 8-18.\n     19\n          Johnson Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, page 17, lines 1-9.

Therefore, under Mr.\n\n     5           Pollock's own proposals (absent aggregation), the CGS program would\n\n     6           still have to be limited to the LIPS class of customers. Aggregation is the\n\n     7           only proposal made by Mr. Pollock that expands the eligibility beyond the\n\n     8           LIPS class of customers.\n\n     9\n\n    10   Q.      WHAT SUGGESTION DOES MR. POLLOCK MAKE REGARDING\n\n    11           AGGREGATION?\n\n    12   A.      Mr. Pollock makes two suggestions:          1) aggregation is not tied to retail\n\n    13           competition; and 2) aggregation is not complicated. 24\n\n    14\n\n    15   Q.      DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THESE TWO SUGGESTIONS?\n\n    16   A       Yes.    First, in attempting to support his claim that aggregation is not\n\n    17           complicated, Mr. Pollock uses an example that contradicts his argument\n\n    18           that aggregation is not a feature of retail competition. The only location\n\n    19           Mr. Pollock cites where aggregation was instituted to allow widespread\n\n    20           customer choice of alternative sources of electricity was in ERGOT.\n\n    21           There, of course, aggregation was expressly included as an element of\n\n\n\n         24\n              /d,pages 40-41.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

As discussed in my\n\n3            Supplemental Direct Testimony, allowing aggregation of load to any\n\n4            customer class is the equivalent to retail open access in that any customer\n\n 5           can choose to aggregate its load with another and thereby select to have\n\n6            an alternative generation supplier.           In connection with the passage of\n\n 7           Senate Bill 7, the Commission spent several years, in numerous projects\n\n 8           and workshops, working with ERCOT and numerous stakeholders to\n\n 9           develop and implement the rules and mechanisms whereby service to a\n\n10           multitude    of    retail   customers       could   be   split   between   regulated\n\n11           Transmission and Distribution service and unregulated generation service.\n\n12           Similarly, ETI would need to be able to identify all the individual customers\n\n13           who decided to take part in aggregation, account for changes in the\n\n14           aggregate group, account for switches between aggregated and traditional\n\n15           service, etc. This Commission is well aware of the difficulties associated\n\n16           with implementing that type of program and, contrary to Mr. Pollock's\n\n17           suggestion, it is certainly complicated and not inexpensive.\n\n18\n\n19   Q.      ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROPOSALS FOR ELIGIBILITY MADE BY\n\n20           MR. POLLOCK?\n\n21   A.      Yes, Mr. Pollock also suggests that customers on LIPS who are also on\n\n22           Standby Maintenance Service (SMS) and Interruptible Service (IS) should\n\n     25\n          E.g, PURA § 39.353.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 24 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          be allowed to contract for CGS supply.               A LIPS customer typically\n\n 2          designates part, but not all, of its load to be served under these separate\n\n 3          rate schedules. SMS is a service that a customer may call on to back up\n\n4           its own co-generation supply under certain circumstances.          IS is a rate\n\n 5          whereby a customer who agrees to allow its service to be curtailed under\n\n 6          certain circumstances receives a bill credit for the load devoted to IS.\n\n 7\n 8   Q.     PLEASE RESPOND TO MR. POLLOCK'S CLAIM THAT CGS SERVICE\n\n 9          CAN READILY BE ADDED ON TOP OF CUSTOMERS ALREADY\n\n10          RECEVING         SERVICE       UNDER         THESE   MULTIPLE    RATES     AND\n\n11          SCHEDULES.\n\n12   A.     As discussed in my Supplemental Direct Testimony, this CGS program is\n\n13          extremely complicated: it will be the single most complicated billing and\n\n14          administration ever attempted on the Entergy system.             Therefore, the\n\n15          Company continues to propose that customers currently on either\n\n16          Schedule IS or Economic As-Available Power Service (EAPS) should not\n\n17           be allowed to participate in the CGS program to satisfy any portion of their\n\n18          firm load at this time.      Customers on Schedules IS and EAPS already\n\n19           have their loads split between firm and other service. Adding a further\n\n20          split of what was firm service between CGS and what then remains for\n\n21          firm service is a further complexity in billing and administration of the CGS\n\n22           program that may be considered at a future date, once the Company and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   Jl\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 25 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           its customers have the opportunity to gain experience in the basics of the\n\n 2           CGS program.\n\n 3                  Moreover, as explained in the Company's response to TIEC RFI\n\n 4           1-8 (attached as Exhibit PRM-2R), this limit on customer eligibility should\n\n 5           likewise extend to LIPS customers who also receive service under the\n\n 6           SMS rate schedule. 26 In that RFI response, ETI further explained that the\n\n 7           Company has a concern that customers on Schedule SMS may be able to\n\n 8           manipulate their own generation to avoid unserved energy charges\n\n 9           associated with a third-party CGS supplier. For example, a customer on\n\n10           SMS is receiving backup service for its own generation. It is possible that\n\n11           customer could utilize this backup service for its generation to instead\n\n12           backup generation from a third-party CGS supplier and thereby avoid\n\n13           unserved energy changes. For these reasons, and because of the same\n\n14           billing concerns applicable to EAPS and IS customers, the CGS tariff\n\n15           should be limited at this time to LIPS customers only.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.      DO YOU        HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENT ON THE CUSTOMER\n\n18           ELIGIBILITY ISSUE?\n\n19   A.      Yes. It makes little sense to extend eligibility for this type of experimental\n\n20           program to customer groups or classes who have shown no interest in\n\n21           participating. Even for the LIPS class of customers expanding CGS to IS,\n\n\n     26\n          SMS service is essentially backup service for a customer who serves its load from\n          co-generation facilities.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 26 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          EAPS and other optional rates makes little since when, as discussed\n\n 2          above, these customers have exhibited no interest in the program.\n\n 3\n\n 4                                    VII.    OTHER ISSUES\n\n 5   Q.     MR. NALEPA AND MR. POLLOCK CLAIM THAT THE FIXED COST\n\n 6          CONTRIBUTION FEE OF $1.10/KW PAID BY CGS PARTICIPANTS\n\n 7          FULLY RECOVERS THE PRODUCTION COST INCURRED BY THE\n\n 8          COMPANY TO SERVE CGS CUSTOMERS. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n 9   A.     No.    The production cost incurred by the Company to serve existing\n\n10          customers, who might migrate to CGS service, is its actual embedded\n\n11          production cost determined in the rate case from which the CGS program\n\n12          will be approved. That actual embedded production cost is the $6.84/kW\n\n13          resulting from Docket No. 37744 described in my Supplemental Direct\n\n14          Testimony and Exhibit PRM-1.             The only offsets to this unrecovered\n\n15          embedded production cost are the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee of\n\n16          $1.1 0/kW and the MSS-1 impact associated with System Agreement\n\n17          recognition of this capacity for MSS-1 purposes. There are no other actual\n\n18          offsets to the unrecovered embedded production costs.\n\n19                  Both Mr. Nalepa and Mr. Pollock would like to now claim that the\n\n20          $1.1 0/kW is associated with providing production service to CGS\n\n21          participants, or in the terms of Mr. Pollock: backup service. This is not the\n\n22          case. The Fixed Cost Contribution Fee has always been discussed as\n\n23          simply a method to reduce any unrecovered costs by having the CGS\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                          Page 27 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           participants pay a contribution to fixed cost.            Characterizing this as\n\n2            recovery of incremental production cost or backup service to serve CGS\n\n3            load is simply wrong.\n\n4\n\n 5   Q.      WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO MR. POLLOCK'S ARGUMENT THAT\n\n6            THE MSS-1 OFFSET IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE MEANS OF PLACING\n\n 7           A MARKET VALUE ON CGS CAPACITY?\n\n 8   A.      Mr. Pollock has completely missed the significance of the MSS-1 offset to\n\n 9           this case.    The reduction in ETI's MSS-1 payment, which is associated\n\n10           with equalizing reserves among the Entergy Operating Companies, is not\n\n11           being used as a proxy value for the CGS capacity, as claimed by\n\n12           Mr. Pollock. 27     The Company is simply recognizing that its MSS-1\n\n13           payments (or cost) will be reduced by recognition of the CGS capacity,\n\n14           and that this is the only known and measurable actual cost reduction\n\n15           attributable to the CGS program available to offset the unrecovered costs.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.      ON PAGE 28, MR. POLLOCK STATES THAT CGS CAPACITY IS AN\n\n18           INCREMENTAL NEW RESOURCE. WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE\n\n19           ON DETERMINATION OF UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n20   A.      As discussed by Company witness Dingle, CGS capacity may help the\n\n21           Company avoid acquiring some capacity in the future, although the ability\n\n22           of CGS capacity to create such a result is limited due to certain program\n\n     27\n          Pollock Supplemental Direct Testimony, page 28, lines 7-9.\n\n\n                                                                                         30\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                   Page 28 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          constraints such as the short-term nature of the CGS contract. However,\n\n 2          CGS capacity in no way avoids embedded capacity cost that the\n\n 3          Company has already incurred. Unrecovered embedded costs due to the\n\n 4          CGS program are none the less still unrecovered.        This is the case\n\n 5          whether or not the CGS capacity allows the Company to avoid any future\n\n 6          capacity costs.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q.     ON PAGE 14, MR. NALEPA CLAIMS THAT THE COMPANY IS\n\n 9          BENEFITING BY THE CGS PROGRAM. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n10   A.     No.    Mr. Nalepa claims that the Company will benefit from any MSS-1\n\n11          savings due to the added CGS capacity for MSS-1 purposes.                As\n\n12          described in my Supplemental Direct Testimony and discussed above,\n\n13          assuming the CGS capacity is firmed up, MSS-1 is being used to offset\n\n14          the unrecovered costs; thus, the Company is not keeping these benefits.\n\n15          Rather, the Company is giving these benefits to those customers who\n\n16          have to pay the unrecovered costs. The Company is simply complying\n\n17          with PURA in ensuring that it is no worse off due to implementation of the\n\n18          CGS program.\n\n19\n\n20   Q.     HOW CAN THE              COMPANY END         UP WORSE    OFF     DUE TO\n\n21          IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n22   A.     There are a number of ways. Examples include: 1) The Company's\n\n23          current rates were designed in Docket No. 37744 to recover the\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                    Page 29 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          Company's embedded cost and provide for a reasonable return to\n\n2           stockholders based on the existing customers.      If those customers are\n\n 3          now provided an alternative supply, the Company no longer recovers the\n\n4           cost of its existing facilities, nor does it recover a return on those\n\n 5          investments; 2) the Company would not be allowed to fully recover its\n\n6           implementation and administration cost of the program; and 3) load growth\n\n 7          could be used as an offset to CGS unrecovered costs and in addition be\n\n 8          used as an offset to purchased power or production cost recovery in a\n\n 9          future ratemaking proceeding.\n\n10\n\n11   Q.     DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER GENERAL COMMENTS REGARDING THE\n\n12          CGS PROGRAM?\n\n13   A.     Yes. As the Company transitions to MISO, the CGS program will need to\n\n14          be redesigned for a number of reasons such as: 1) QF pricing under\n\n15          MISO will change; 2) the capacity market under MISO will be more\n\n16          transparent; 3) uncertainty of what the MISO capacity market will look like;\n\n17          4) QFs will have different options under MISO; and 5) ETI's options will be\n\n18          different under MISO. Based on these factors it can be anticipated that a\n\n19          revision to the CGS program as currently envisioned will be required in\n\n20          2013 as ETI and the other Entergy Operating Companies enter MISO.\n\f    Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME, BUSINESS ADDRESS, EMPLOYER AND\n\n 3           JOB TITLE.\n\n4    A       My name is Andrew J. O'Brien. My business address is Parkwood Two\n\n 5           Bldg., Suite 300, 10055 Grogan's Mill Road, The Woodlands, Texas\n\n 6           77380.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q.      BY WHOM ARE YOU EMPLOYED AND IN WHAT CAPACITY?\n\n 9   A        I am employed as Manager, Power Marketing by Entergy Services, Inc.,\n\n10           the service company affiliate providing engineering, planning, accounting,\n\n11           technical, regulatory support and other services to Entergy Texas, Inc.\n\n12           (\"ETI\" or the \"Company\") and the other Operating Companies of the\n\n13            Entergy System. 1 Although each individual Operating Company owns its\n\n14           generating resources and transmission assets, the Entergy System is\n\n15           planned and operated as a single, integrated system pursuant to the terms\n\n16            and conditions of the Entergy System Agreement. 2\n\n\n\n          The six Entergy Operating Companies are Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (\"EAI\"), Entergy Gulf\n          States Louisiana, L.L.C. (\"EGSL\"), Entergy Louisiana, LLC (\"ELL\"), Entergy Mississippi, Inc.\n          (\"EMI\"), Entergy Texas, Inc. (\"ETI\") and Entergy New Orleans, Inc. (\"ENOl\"). The electric\n          generation and bulk transmission assets of these six Operating Companies are operated on a\n          coordinated basis as a single electric system, referred to as the \"Entergy System\" or the\n          \"System.\"\n     2\n          The Entergy System Agreement is a FERC-approved rate schedule and contract entered into\n          among ESI and the Operating Companies, which requires the Operating Companies to plan,\n          construct and operate their electric generation and bulk transmission facilities as a single,\n          integrated electric system. It is administered by the Entergy Operating Committee. EAI and\n          EMI have provided notice to the other Operating Companies that they are terminating their\n          participation in the System Agreement effective December 2013 and November 2015,\n          respectively, or on such earlier dates as the FERC may permit.\n\f                                                                                Docket No. 38951\n                                                                               Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                              ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE        DESCRIBE         YOUR           BUSINESS        EXPERIENCE         AND\n\n 2          EDUCATION.\n\n 3   A.     I have been employed by ESI since June, 2001. During my career, I have\n\n 4          held numerous positions, including my current leadership position, in the\n\n 5          areas of commercial           negotiations,     regulatory,   generation dispatch\n\n 6          operations as well as resource and operations planning. In June, 2001, I\n\n 7          accepted a position as Next Day Scheduler in the power marketing\n\n 8          department of the Energy Management Organization (\"EMO\"). From 2003\n\n 9          to 2006, I worked as a Generation System Dispatcher and then as the Sr.\n\n10          Lead Analyst in the Current Day Operations group. In 2007, I accepted\n\n11          the role of Wholesale Executive in the Supply Procurement department\n\n12          and was promoted in 2008 to Manager, Supply Procurement. In this role,\n\n13              gained     significant    experience       negotiating     long-term     resource\n\n14          acquisitions, both asset purchases and purchase power agreements. In\n\n15          2010, I accepted a position within the EMO as Manager, Operations\n\n16          Support which is responsible for overseeing the development and\n\n17          implementation of the next-day resource plan including generation\n\n18          commitment and system load forecast.             In September 2011, I assumed\n\n19          the position of Manager, Power Marketing. I have a Masters Degree in\n\n20          Business Administration from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor of\n\n21          Science Degree in Psychology from Louisiana State University.\n\f                                                                         Docket No. 38951\n                                                                        Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                       ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

I am submitting this testimony to the Public Utility Commission (\"PUCT\" or\n\n 3          the \"Commission\") on behalf of ETI.\n\n 4\n\n 5   Q.     HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY FILED TESTIMONY IN THIS PROCEEDING?\n\n 6   A.     No.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q.     WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECT\n\n 9          TESTIMONY?\n\n10   A.     I address two issues in support of Company witness Phillip R. May's\n\n11          Supplemental Direct Testimony regarding the Competitive Generation\n\n12          Service (\"CGS\") program that is at issue in this proceeding. First, I explain\n\n13          that the value of capacity must consider many different factors related to\n\n14          the characteristics of the capacity product at issue and the market\n\n15          environment in which that capacity is being evaluated. As such, it is not\n\n16          feasible to assign some independent arbitrary value to the capacity that\n\n17          CGS Customers will use to supply their energy needs under the CGS\n\n18          Program.      I offer this explanation to support Company witness May's\n\n19          discussion of ETI's position regarding the appropriate definition and\n\n20          calculation of unrecovered costs. My explanation addresses the factors\n\n21          that must be considered when valuing capacity, and concludes that the\n\n22          characteristics of CGS capacity are associated with relatively low-value\n\n23          products.\n                                                                                             5\n\f                                                                                      Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                     Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                                    ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1                          also support Company witness May's testimony regarding\n\n 2            eligibility for participating in the CGS Program, explaining why important\n\n 3            operational concerns support the Company's position that the minimum\n\n4             capacity supplied by a CGS Purchase Agreement should be 10 MW.\n\n 5\n\n6                     II.      ASSESSING THE VALUE OF CGS CAPACITY\n\n 7   Q.       WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURCHASED CAPACITY\n\n 8            PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN ELEMENT OF THE\n\n 9            CGS PROGRAM?\n\n10   A.       My understanding is that the parties to this proceeding have been\n\n11            engaged in negotiations for some time aimed at achieving a collaborative\n\n12            resolution of a number of contested matters surrounding the design and\n\n13            implementation of the CGS Program. As further discussed by Company\n\n14            witness May, that negotiating process has resulted in a tentative proposal\n\n15            that purchased power supplied by a third party to ETI under the CGS\n\n16            Program may be counted as ETI's capacity (or, in the terminology of the\n\n17            Entergy System Agreement, \"capability\") by the Entergy System. 3 I will\n\n18            refer to this capacity product in my testimony as \"CGS Capacity\" and the\n\n\n     3\n          The parties to the case, including ETI, have not reached agreement on all matters necessary\n          to establish a CGS program that includes such a capacity product. Matters yet to be resolved\n          are listed in the \"Agreed List of Unsettled Issues and Issues Contingent on a Commission\n          Determination of Unsettled Issues\" filed on November 1, 2011. By providing this testimony,\n          ETI does not in any manner waive its rights to continue to fully contest any and all issues that\n          remain disputed among the parties. ETI presents this testimony solely for the purpose of\n          facilitating the Commission's resolution of the three threshold issues, which may facilitate\n          further efforts by the parties to resolve remaining contested issues surrounding the design of\n          the CGS program and tariffs.\n\f                                                                                   Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                  Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                                 ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                 Page 5 of 11\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           contracts under which this capacity is supplied to the Entergy System as\n\n 2           \"CGS Purchase Agreement.\"\n\n 3                   As currently contemplated, when the CGS program goes into effect,\n\n4            the CGS Capacity would consist of an obligation on the part of the CGS\n\n 5           Supplier to deliver to ETI's transmission system a contractually-specified\n\n 6           amount of energy 24 hours per day, seven days per week (\"24/7\") on a\n\n 7           firm, unit-contingent basis. 4        ETI, however, will not make a capacity\n\n 8           payment to the CGS Supplier. Instead, ETI will pay the CGS Supplier for\n\n 9           the energy provided under the CGS Purchase Agreement at the avoided\n\n10           cost rate established under ETI's rate schedule LQF. The CGS Supplier\n\n11           would look to the CGS Customer, under a separate contract, for payment\n\n12           for the capacity provided to ETI.\n\n13\n\n14   Q.      CAN     ETI    UNAMBIGUOUSLY DETERMINE THE VALUE TO THE\n\n15           ENTERGY SYSTEM OF THE CAPACITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CGS\n\n16            PROGRAM?\n\n17   A.       No.   The value of any capacity purchase is a function of a number of\n\n18           different factors, including, for example, the operational characteristics of\n\n19           the capacity purchase, the location of that capacity, the term of the\n\n20           agreement, and the availability of other market alternatives. Moreover, it\n\n21            is difficult to assign discrete scores to these characteristics.             I am not\n\n     4\n          \"Unit Contingent\" means that so long as the CGS Supplier's generating unit is physically\n          capable of producing energy (or \"available\"), the CGS Supplier has the obligation to deliver\n          the contractually-specified amount of energy.\n\f                                                                         Docket No. 38951\n                                                                        Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                       ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

However, it is reasonable to consider how a specific\n\n4           capacity product ranks on a sliding scale of more or less valuable\n\n 5          according to each of the relevant characteristics, consider all of the\n\n6           characteristics collectively, and reach a conclusion about the relative value\n\n7           of a specific capacity product.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.     WOULD YOU PLEASE LIST SOME OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS,\n\n10          AND EXPLAIN HOW THEY APPLY TO CGS CAPACITY?\n\n11   A      Yes. The following Table 1 lists and describes some of the prominent\n\n12          characteristics that should be considered when evaluating capacity, and\n\n13           indicates where CGS capacity lies on the spectrum of more to less\n\n14          valuable.\n\f                                                                             Docket No. 38951\n                                                                            Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                           ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\nEntergy Texas, Inc.

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ETI'S CUSTOMERS, IS THERE ANY\n\n 7          VALUE THAT CAN BE ASCRIBED TO CGS CAPACITY?\n\n 8   A.     Yes. As discussed in more detail by Company witness May, the Entergy\n\n 9          Operating Committee has agreed to consider CGS Capacity as ETI\n\n10          capability for purposes of determining ETI's payment obligations pursuant\n\n11          to Service Schedule MSS-1 of the System Agreement, so long as CGS\n\n12           Capacity meets certain conditions imposed by the Operating Company.\n\n13          That treatment means that ETI's capacity costs will be decreased as a\n\n14           result of the CGS program.\n\f                   ~~   ---~-   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Docket\n                                                                           ----   No.\n                                                                                   - 38951\n                                                                                      -------.\n                                                                             Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                            ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT ASPECT OF THE ISSUES REGARDING ELIGIBILITY TO\n\n 3          PARTICIPATE IN THE CGS PROGRAM DO YOU ADDRESS?\n\n 4   A.     I discuss the issue of whether it would be advisable to allow CGS\n\n 5          Customers to contract with CGS Suppliers for very small amounts of\n\n 6          capacity, thus permitting an opportunity for an increased amount of very\n\n 7          small CGS Purchase Agreements.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.     WHAT IS ETI'S POSITION ON THIS ISSUE?\n\n10   A.     ETI's position is that a CGS Customer should not be permitted to contract\n\n11          with a CGS Supplier for a level of capacity less than 10 MW.\n\n12          Furthermore, for the reasons explained by Company witness May,\n\n13          customers should not be allowed to aggregate their load for purposes of\n\n14          contracting for CGS supply. As a result of these conditions, eligibility to\n\n15          participate in the CGS program would be limited to customers who can\n\n16          individually contract for at least 10 MW of CGS Capacity.\n\n17\n\n18   Q.     ARE THERE OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE\n\n19           IMPOSITION              OF    A   10   MW     FLOOR     FOR    PARTICIPATING\n\n20          CUSTOMERS?\n\n21   A.     Yes. From an operational perspective, the key factor is not the size of the\n\n22          contracts with CGS Suppliers, but is instead the number of CGS\n\n23          Suppliers.            From time to time, especially in emergency situations or in\n\n                                                                                            ll\n\f                                                                             Docket No. 38951\n                                                                            Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                           ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                         Page 10 of 11\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          situations in which the transmission system operator calls for curtailments\n\n 2          to alleviate transmission constraints, the System's dispatchers must reach\n\n 3          out and provide instructions to each Purchased Power Agreement (\"PPA\")\n\n 4          counterparty. That process grows more difficult as the number of PPAs\n\n 5          increases. Currently, the parties to the CGS proceeding have reached a\n\n 6          tentative agreement in principle that the total amount of customer load\n\n 7          should be capped at somewhere between 80 and 150 MW, although there\n\n 8          is no specific agreement regarding the specific cap level within that range.\n\n 9          This cap, combined with a minimum size of 10 MW, would limit the\n\n10          number of potential CGS Purchase Agreements to 8 to 15, a number that\n\n11          should be able to be reasonably accommodated.\n\n12                  From     an   administrative     and   operational   perspective,   when\n\n13          managing load on the System, the System dispatchers must undertake\n\n14          the same procedures regardless of the size of the contract.            Thus, for\n\n15          example, the same notification procedures are used to pursue the\n\n16          reduction of a 10 MW resource as are used for a 100 MW resource during\n\n17          a low load event. The lower the MW limit for participation in the CGS\n\n18          program, the more likely that the administrative burden exceeds the\n\n19          benefit provided by the resource during emergencies such a low load\n\n20          events.      Further, the value of lower capacity level PPAs is less.\n\n21          Continuing with the example of the management of low load events, in the\n\n22          case of the 10 MW and 100 MW PPAs, when having to manage a low\n\n23          load event, the ability to turn down 100 MW provides substantially greater\n\f                                                                     Docket No. 38951\n                                                                    Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                   ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n    Entergy Texas, Inc.

In general,\n\n2          given the size of the load on the Entergy System, contracts as small as 10\n\n3          MW simply do not provide the same capacity value as larger PPAs, and in\n\n4          the absence of special programs, such as CGS, that are entered into for\n\n5          specific reasons, the System would not generally contract for such small\n\n6          amounts.\n\n7\n\n8   Q.

Page 2 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             Purchase Agreements. As noted in my Direct Testimony, there is no way\n\n2              to unambiguously determine at this time the value to the Entergy System\n\n 3             of CGS Capacity to be acquired in the future.              The value or price of\n\n4              capacity is determined based on considerations and circumstances\n\n 5             existing at the time a decision is made to acquire capacity, as well as the\n\n 6              process employed, such as, for instance, a Request for Proposal, which\n\n 7              relies on competitive bidding.          Additionally, unlike energy transactions,\n\n 8             there are no pre-existing capacity markets or indices to consult when\n\n 9              purchasing capacity.          With that understanding, the point of my Direct\n\n10             Testimony was simple; namely, that the value of purchased capacity is a\n\n11              function of a number of different factors or attributes; that,                 as\n\n12              contemplated, CGS Capacity ranks relatively low for five of seven major\n\n13              attributes; and that, accordingly, CGS Capacity \"is not a product that\n\n14              would reasonably be expected to have a high level of value.\" 2\n\n15\n16   Q.         MR. POLLOCK CONTENDS THAT A BASE-LOAD PRODUCT DOES\n\n17              NOT      NEED         FLEXIBILITY. 3      DOES    THAT     UNDERMINE       YOUR\n\n18              CONCLUSION REGARDING THE LOW VALUE OF CGS CAPACITY?\n\n19   A.         No. While an inflexible product may be able to provide a base-load role,\n\n20              flexibility is expected to add value to the resource, even if the resource\n\n21              may also         be    used to    provide a base-load       role.

Page 3 of7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             notwithstanding ETI's base-load deficit, ETI still places a value on flexible\n\n 2             capacity.     The current 2011 Western Region RFP, which seeks to fill a\n\n 3             long-term capacity need for ETI, makes clear that flexibility is preferred:\n\n 4                      Resources supplying flexibility offer benefits to Entergy\n 5                      Texas and the Entergy System that resources with less\n 6                      flexible or inflexible scheduling and dispatch capabilities\n 7                      cannot provide. Bidders are advised that these benefits will\n 8                      be captured quantitatively and qualitatively in the evaluation\n 9                      of proposals and ... will result in, all else being equal, a\n10                      preference for Flexible Capacity over Baseload Capacity\n11                      resources. 4\n12\n13             Further, Mr. Pollock's observation regarding the ability of the Entergy\n\n14             System Operator to order the CGS Supplier to curtail or not operate during\n\n15             System emergencies misses the mark. 5              The referenced emergency\n\n16             curtailment rights do not provide, and are notably different from, the right\n\n17             and ability to adjust the output of a resource to respond to dynamic\n\n18             changes in load, which is the valuable \"flexibility\" I discuss in my Direct\n\n19             Testimony.\n\n20\n\n21   Q.        MR. POLLOCK CONTENDS THAT THE PROSPECT OF PAYING\n\n22              UNSERVED ENERGY FOR LACK OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD\n\n23             ADDRESS ANY FIRMNESS CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE\n\n\n\n\n     4\n         2011 Western Region Request for Proposals for Long-Term Supply Side Resources, p. 7.\n     5\n         Pollock Direct, p. 31, Ins 6- 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 4 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             UNIT-CONTINGENT                NATURE      OF   THE   CGS   PURCHASE\n\n 2             AGREEEMENT. 6 DO YOU AGREE?\n\n 3   A.        No. CGS Suppliers must be Qualified Facilities (\"QFs\") connected to\n\n4              the ETI System. My low ranking on \"firmness\" relates to the reality\n\n 5             that many factors affect the firmness of a resource. Among these\n\n 6             factors would be the number of units providing service. Most QFs\n\n 7             consists of a single generating unit, rather than a system or fleet of\n\n 8             generating resources.           Regardless of economic motivation, the\n\n 9             reliability of supply, or firmness, is proportional to the number of units\n\n10             providing service. It follows that a unit-contingent product is less firm\n\n11             than a \"system\"-contingent product.             As noted in my Direct\n\n12             Testimony, the fact that a CGS (QF) Supplier has the primary\n\n13             obligation to serve a host load further reduces the firmness of\n\n14             supply.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.         PLEASE COMMENT ON MR POLLOCK'S OBSERVATION WITH\n\n17              REGARD TO HIS EXHIBIT JP-7 THAT ETI HAS ENTERED INTO\n\n18              NUMEROUS               UNIT   CONTINGENT        PURCHASED       POWER\n\n\n\n\n     6\n         Pollock Direct, p. 31, Ins 9 - 16.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             5\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 5 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n\n 1             AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS WITH TERMS AS\n\n 2              SHORT AS ONE TO THREE YEARS. 7\n\n 3   A.         All of the contracts listed in Exhibit JP-7 are distinguishable from the\n\n4               contemplated CGS Purchase Agreements, and, as such, Exhibit\n\n 5             JP-7 actually makes the point made in my Direct Testimony. Each\n\n 6              of the contracts listed in the Exhibit provide one or more attributes\n\n 7             that will not be provided by a CGS Purchase Agreement.                For\n\n 8              instance, certain of the contracts are for a level of capacity (MW)\n\n 9              greater than 150 MW. A number of the contracts provide flexibility.\n\n10              Others provide a term longer than five years.        Put another way,\n\n11              unlike the contracts that would result from the CGS program, none of\n\n12              the contracts listed in the Exhibit provide a low level of inflexible,\n\n13              short-term capacity from a resource that Entergy does not control.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.         MR. POLLOCK IS PROPOSING A LOWER LIMIT OF 5 MW\n\n16              RATHER THAN THE 10 MW YOU PROPOSED.                      COULD YOU\n\n17              CONSIDER SUPPORTING A 5 MW LIMIT? 8\n\n18   A.         Yes, my Direct Testimony was clear that the concern is not the size\n\n19              of the contracts with CGS Suppliers, but is instead the number of\n\n\n     7\n         Pollock Direct, p. 32, lines 1 - 5.\n     8\n         Pollock Direct, pp. 32 and 43.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            6\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 6 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             CGS Suppliers. I should also add that the number of CGS contracts\n\n 2             is a concern. As noted in my Direct Testimony, the lower the floor\n\n 3             for participation, the greater the opportunity for more suppliers and\n\n4              more contracts at a smaller capacity size, which, as noted in my\n\n 5             Direct Testimony, can raise cost-benefit concerns. In the event the\n\n 6             Commission determined to permit 5 MW contracts, ETI may seek a\n\n 7             limitation on the number of contracts, depending on the ultimate\n\n 8             level of participation. 9\n\n 9\n\n10   Q.        DOES THE FACT THAT ETI'S SERVICE AREA IS WITHIN THE\n\n11             WOTAB         PLANNING        REGION,      A   CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED\n\n12             REGION,         CAUSE        YOU   TO      RECONSIDER     YOUR       LOW\n\n13             \"LOCATION\" RANKING FOR CGS CAPACITY. 10\n\n14   A.        No. My ranking attributes some value for \"location\" to CGS Capacity,\n\n15             which reflects Mr. Pollock's observation that ETI is within WOTAB;\n\n16             however, the relatively low ranking also reflects that all but one QF is\n\n17             located outside of Entergy's Western Region (generally the region\n\n18             within the ETI area that is west of the Trinity River), which has a\n\n19             greater need for capacity than other areas within WOTAB.\n\n     9\n      Based on the contemplated cap of 150 MW for the CGS Program and ETI's recommended 10\n     MW lower contract limit, the maximum number of contracts would be 15.\n     10\n          Pollock Direct, p. 33, Ins 4-7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             7\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WOULD           YOU     PLEASE         COMMENT             ON   THE   ISSUE      OF\n\n 2             AGGREGATION?\n\n 3   A.        Mr. Pollock acknowledges that he has not conducted a study of the\n\n4              operational, billing or customer support ramifications that might be\n\n 5             associated with aggregation. 11 Neither can ETI warrant that there\n\n 6             would be no difficulties, including those that might be prohibitive,\n\n7              related to ETI's supply, planning and operational responsibilities,\n\n 8             were      the    CGS       program          to   include   aggregation.      These\n\n 9             considerations suggest that any CGS program, if implemented,\n\n10             should not include aggregation.\n\n11\n\n12                                         II.

PLEASE        DESCRIBE         YOUR       EDUCATIONAL            AND      PROFESSIONAL\n\n10            BACKGROUND.\n\n11   A.       I hold a Bachelor of Science degree, with majors in Economics and Government,\n\n12           from The Florida State University and a Master of Business Administration\n\n13           degree from the Mays School of Business at Texas A&M University.\n\n14                   My professional career began in 1980 when I joined Middle South\n\n15            Services, Inc. (ESI's predecessor in name), as an Associate Econometrician in\n\n16           the System Planning department.                 I remained in the System Planning\n\n17           department, with positions of increasing responsibility, for about the next decade.\n\n18            During my tenure in the System Planning department, I was responsible for\n\n19           preparing forecasts of economic activity, fuel prices, energy consumption, and\n\n20           peak load. I also was responsible for performing various economic analyses.\n\n\n     4\n          The Entergy System Agreement is an FERC-approved rate schedule and contract entered into\n          among ESI and the Operating Companies, by which the Operating Companies plan, construct and\n          operate their electric generation and bulk transmission facilities as a single, integrated electric\n          system, referred to as the \"Entergy System\" or, simply, the \"System.\" The System Agreement is\n          administered by the Entergy Operating Committee.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       004\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

While in the Least Cost Planning Department, I was responsible for\n\n 5          advising the System's senior management regarding the development and\n\n 6          implementation of LCIRP policies that would be consistent with Federal and local\n\n 7          initiatives advancing the public interest, advocating the System's position in\n\n 8          public rulemakings related to LCIRP initiatives, preparing LCIRP filings,\n\n 9          assessing demand-side management programs, and considering alternative\n\n10          methods for meeting the Operating Companies' future resource needs.\n\n11                  In 1995, I joined EAI as the Regulatory Affairs Coordinator, with\n\n12          responsibility for coordinating EAI's regulatory activities before the Arkansas\n\n13          Public Service Commission (\"APSC\"). My primary responsibilities in that position\n\n14          were to manage the day-to-day interactions between EAI and the APSC's\n\n15          General Staff and advise EAI and ESI employees regarding compliance with the\n\n16          Arkansas Commission's regulatory requirements.       I was also responsible for\n\n17          overseeing the preparation of EAI's filings with the APSC, coordinating EAI's\n\n18          responses to discovery, and training EAI and ESI staff regarding APSC\n\n19          regulatory requirements. In 1999, I returned to ESI as the Manager, Regulatory\n\n20          Affairs for the SPO organization. I was promoted to my current position in early\n\n21          2008.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     005\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR TESTIMONY IN THIS PROCEEDING?\n\n13   A      I rebut certain of the claims that Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (\"TIEC\")\n\n14          witness Jeffry Pollock asserts in his February 10, 2012 testimony in this docket.\n\n15          Specifically, I\n\n16              •   Discuss Mr. Pollock's flawed understanding of ETI's resource planning\n\n17                  and resource plans, ultimately explaining that the CGS program is at best\n\n18                  a limited-term alternative that could defer or displace short- and limited-\n\n19                  term Purchased Power Agreements (\"PPA\"), but it in no way can be\n\n20                  considered a long-term resource option or a program that affects ETI's\n\n21                  long-term acquisition strategy;\n\n22              •   Address Mr. Pollock's implied assertion that the CGS program will allow\n\n23                  ETI to avoid some level of embedded capacity cost, explaining that -\n\n\n\n\n                                                     006\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

CGS CAPACITY AND ETI'S CAPACITY DEFICIT\n\n 9   Q.       WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF MR. POLLOCK'S CONTENTION WITH\n\n10            RESPECT TO CGS CAPACITY AND ETI'S CAPACITY DEFICIT?\n\n11   A.       Mr. Pollock contends that CGS Capacity can reduce ETI's capacity deficit, and,\n\n12            in particular, ETI's base-load capacity deficit. 5 He bases this conclusion on the\n\n13            following provisions included in the tentative proposal under consideration by the\n\n14            parties and described in the Supplemental Direct Testimony of Company\n\n15            witnesses Phillip R. May and Andrew J. O'Brien:\n\n16                    •   A CGS Supplier must enter into a contract (\"CGS Purchase\n\n17                        Agreement\") with ETI to provide CGS capacity on a 7X24 basis, except\n\n18                        when the supplier's resource is not physically available;\n\n19                    •   The CGS Supplier must obtain the status of a network resource under\n\n20                        Entergy's OATT for the duration of the proposed CGS Purchase\n\n21                        Agreement (which must also correspond with the term of the contract\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          Pollock Direct at 13, 24-25.\n\n\n\n                                                       007\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                          Page 6 of 26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1                        between the CGS Supplier and the CGS Customer (\"Customer-\n\n 2                        Supplier Contract\"). 6\n\n 3                    •   If the above conditions are met, and all remaining issues are resolved,\n\n 4                        the Entergy Operating Committee 7 has indicated that CGS Capacity\n\n 5                        can be treated as capacity that is allocated to ETI.\n\n 6\n\n 7           Mr. Pollock implicitly concludes that because of these attributes - the 7X24\n\n 8           delivery obligation in particular - CGS Capacity should be considered a \"base\n\n 9           load\" resource for the Entergy System.               He further notes that because the\n\n10           Entergy System's 2009 Strategic Resource Plan (\"SRP\") Refresh reflects a\n\n11           capacity deficit and, in particular, a base-load deficit of 969 MW for ETI, 8 CGS\n\n12           Capacity \"would provide the utility much needed base-load capacity\" and \"can\n\n13           offset ETI's projected base-load capacity deficit.\" 9\n\n\n\n     6\n         Pollock Direct at 25. Mr. Pollock also states that the CGS supplier must achieve a minimum 80%\n         capacity factor measured during on-peak hours. (Pollock, Page 12, line 11) Actually, as a 7X24\n         product, CGS Purchase Agreement requires the Supplier to provide energy at the contracted MW\n         level every hour that the facility is available. Mr. Pollock reference is to the economic consequence\n         associated with an increase in demand payment if the Supplier fails to provide energy at the\n         contracted level during 80% of the on-peak hours. Mr. Pollock further states at Page 25, Footnote 9\n         that \"several of ETI's Purchased Power Agreements obligate ETI (and not the seller) to obtain\n         network transmission service. To clarify, there is no relevance to this observation, which speaks only\n         to the process by which transmission service is obtained for a potential System resource. For\n         instance, even under the proposed CGS program, ESI, on behalf of ETI, will be making application for\n         network service for the CGS Purchase Agreement. The fact that ETI (or ESI, on behalf of ETI), takes\n         responsibility for the application process does not change the requirement that the resource must be\n         qualified as a network resource.\n     7\n         The Entergy Operating Committee is the entity responsible for administering the Entergy System\n         Agreement, a FERC-filed rate schedule that governs the coordinated planning and operations of the\n         Entergy System.\n     8\n         Note that the Entergy System prepared periodic updates of its SRP; subsequent SRPs will reflect a\n         different base load deficit than that shown in the 2009 SRP Refresh as a result of changes in load\n         growth or resource additions/retirements.\n     9\n         Pollock Direct, p. 13, Ins 1-8.\n\n\n\n                                                        008\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ARE      THERE       FUNDAMENTAL           RESOURCE     PLANNING       PRINCIPLES\n\n 2          RELEVANT TO THE EVALUATION OF MR. POLLOCK'S CLAIMS?\n\n 3   A.     Yes. As an initial observation, it is somewhat irrelevant to discuss \"ETI's base\n\n 4          load resource need\" outside of the context of the System Agreement.              The\n\n 5          System Agreement requires that all of the System's resources are planned\n\n 6          collectively for the mutual benefit of all of the System's load, and the allocation of\n\n 7          any new resources is a decision that is made after System-wide resource\n\n 8          acquisition issues are addressed. That said, the starting point for the System's\n\n 9          resource planning is its load forecast, meaning the demand (MW) and energy\n\n10          (MWh) that the System's resources must serve over various planning horizons.\n\n11          Based on that load forecast, the System then plans for the acquisition of\n\n12          resources necessary to economically and reliably meet the load over the same\n\n13          planning horizons.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.     WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THE CGS PROGRAM\n\n16          WILL AFFECT PLANS TO SERVE LOAD PARTICIPATING IN THE CGS\n\n17          PROGRAM?\n\n18   A.     It is uncertain how a CGS customer's load will ultimately be treated for planning\n\n19          purposes, or whether that treatment will change over time as ETI gains\n\n20          experience with the program. Having said that, it is my understanding that, at\n\n21          least initially, a customer's participation in the CGS program will not affect ETI's\n\n22          plan to serve the portion of a customer's load associated with CGS Capacity\n\n\n\n\n                                                     009\n\f--   ---   --~-~~-----~\n\n\n\n\n                Entergy Texas, Inc.

Stephen Dingle\n                Docket No. 38951\n\n            1            (\"CGS Load\"). 10 Through the CGS program, a customer's load will be served via\n\n            2            energy that flows through the meter, and as such will be included in the load that\n\n            3            ETI is obligated to serve.\n\n            4\n\n            5   a.       WILL CGS CAPACITY REDUCE LONG TERM RESOURCE NEEDS?\n\n            6   A.       No. The program, as it is currently defined, will not provide long-term resources\n\n            7            to meet projected resource needs.               The limited term nature of the proposed\n\n            8            agreements, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the future continuation of the\n\n            9            program, do not provide sufficient assurance that CGS resources will be\n\n           10            available to meet Ell's long-term resource needs.                   Furthermore, the program\n\n           11            does not relieve ETI of its obligation to serve CGS customers in the event that\n\n           12            providers withdraw or fail to renew under the program.                      Ultimately, the CGS\n\n           13            program is at best a limited-term alternative that could defer or displace short-\n\n           14            and limited-term PPAs, but it in no way can be considered a long-term resource\n\n           15            option or affect ETI's long-term acquisition strategy.\n\n           16                    Because of its characteristics, CGS Capacity could possibly defer or\n\n           17            displace the acquisition of new short- and limited-term Purchased Power\n\n           18            Agreements (\"PPA\") that ETI might otherwise acquire, but would not defer or\n\n           19            displace the acquisition of long-term capacity. Because ETI will continue to plan\n\n           20            to serve Customers' CGS load, while obtaining only short- and limited-term\n\n\n                10\n                     Note, however, that Cities witness Karl J. Nalepa has suggested that the Commission should direct\n                     ETI not to plan to serve load served under the CGS tariff. Nalepa Direct at 8.

EVEN ASSUMING THAT A CGS PURCHASE AGREEMENT HAS BASE-LOAD\n\n 5          RESOURCE CHARACTERISTICS, IS IT CORRECT TO CONCLUDE THAT\n\n 6          CGS CAPACITY REDUCES ETI'S BASE LOAD DEFICIT?\n\n 7   A.     Not necessarily. First, there is no reduction in the existing base-load capacity\n\n 8          deficit with respect to a CGS Purchase Agreement associated with new ETIIoad.\n\n 9          In that case, the CGS Capacity is added only for the purpose of serving the\n\n10          additional load contractually associated with the CGS Capacity and, so, as\n\n11          discussed above, there is no additional capacity available to reduce ETI's\n\n12          base-load capacity deficit or any of ETI's capacity deficits for that matter.\n\n13                  Additionally, even though it will become a System capacity resource with\n\n14          certain base-load characteristics, a CGS Purchase Agreement does not provide\n\n15          capacity and associated energy to the System in the same way as other base-\n\n16          load resources. A CGS Purchase Agreement is contractually linked to a specific\n\n17          CGS Customer and has been acquired only because of the load of that\n\n18          Customer. Moreover, the System can only rely on the CGS Supply as a firm\n\n19          resource so long as that contractual relationship between the CGS Customer and\n\n20          the CGS Supplier remains in place.              This relationship creates additional\n\n21          complexities within the resource planning process, because it adds additional\n\n22          uncertainty to future supply and demand.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     011\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK'S CLAIM THAT CGS CAPACITY\n\n2            REFLECTS A CAPACITY BENEFIT COMPARABLE TO $6.66 PER t<m-\n\n3            MONTH?11\n\n4    A.      Mr. Pollock glosses over the fundamental interrelationship between capacity cost\n\n 5           and energy cost.        It is difficult to consider one without the other.           Typically,\n\n6            resource planners are willing to pay high capacity costs for units that have a low\n\n 7           variable cost - so long as those units can be run in a base-load role - because\n\n 8           over the course of a year the high fixed cost can be spread over a large number\n\n 9           of MWh of generation, and the \"all-in• cost, or the sum total of the amortized foced\n\n10           cost and the variable (fuel) cost should be relatively low. On the other hand, all\n\n11           things equal, planners are not willing to pay a high capital cost for a resource that\n\n12           will be called on to run only a few hours a year. For example, a nuclear unit\n\n13           tends to have a high capacity cost and a low c-=cost, while a peaker like a\n\n14           combustion turbine typically has a low fixed capital cost and relatively high\n\n15           energy cost. In fact, the Entergy System has recently purchased high-heat rate\n\n16           peaking contracts for a capacity payment of less than $1/kW/month.                         CGS\n\n17           capacity is a unique product - even though ETI will not pay the CGS Supplier\n\n18           any direct capacity payment, ETI will pay the CGS Supplier its avoided energy\n\n19           cost, which will never be as low as the cost of energy from the System's nuclear\n\n20           units, and may at some times be equal to the cost of peaking energy. 12\n\n\n     11\n          Pollock Direct at 26-27.\n     12\n          Mr. Pollock also seems to suggest that there will be no energy costs to other customers, because the\n          energy cost will be offset by an energy credit. That is an over-simplified argument that ignores the\n          actual mechanics of the PUCT's fiXed fuel factor, fuel surcharge/refund, and fuel reconciliation\n          processes.\n\f-        ---~~~~\n\n\n\n\n         Entergy Texas, Inc.

THE VALUE OF CGS CAPACITY DOES NOT REDUCE EMBEDDED COSTS\n\n     2   Q.       DOES MR. POLLOCK CLAIM THAT THE CGS CAPACITY DISPLACES ANY\n\n     3            OF ETI'S EXISTING RESOURCES?\n\n     4   A        Mr. Pollock does not expressly make that claim; however, several of his\n\n     5            statements indicate his recognition that CGS Capacity would not displace any\n\n     6            existing resources.      He states that \"CGS can offset ETI's projected base-load\n\n     7            capacity deficit.\" 13   He also purports to explain \"how the CGS program could\n\n     8            potentially offset the need for new base-load capacity.\" 14             In his discussion of\n\n     9            \"other offsetting cost savings,\" he argues that the CGS program results in\n\n    10            capacity available to the Entergy System that \"ETI will not have to procure,\" and,\n\n    11            in turn, ETI can \"defer or displace additional generation capacity that would be\n\n    12            needed to maintain reliable service.\" 15 Additionally, as mentioned, Mr. Pollock\n\n    13            notes that the 2009 Entergy SRP Refresh reflects a deficit for ETI that is\n\n    14            substantially greater than the 150 MW maximum cap initially proposed for the\n\n    15            CGS program. Even assuming that the entire 150 MW was subscribed under the\n\n    16            CGS program, ETI would still have a capacity need greater than all of its existing\n\n    17            resources.\n\n\n\n\n         13\n              Pollock Direct at 13 (emphasis added).\n         14\n              Pollock Direct at 25 (emphasis added). The discussion of this issue in Mr. Pollock's deposition also\n              indicates that the acquisition of CGS Capacity can only affect future resource decisions (the costs\n              associated with those decisions) made after the acquisition of CGS capacity.

Page 12 of 26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1   Q.       WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF MR. POLLOCK'S RECOGNITION THAT CGS\n\n 2            CAPACITY DOES NOT DISPLACE ETI'S EXISTING CAPACITY?\n\n 3   A.       Company witness. May, in his Supplemental Direct Testimony (January 26,\n\n 4            2012), explained that ETI is seeking recovery of \"unrecovered costs\" which the\n\n 5            Company has defined as its embedded generation costs, 16 and that an offset to\n\n 6            these costs is appropriate only if the CGS program results in an actual reduction\n\n 7            to ETI's revenue requirement associated with those embedded costs. \"17 The\n\n 8            embedded costs Mr. May addresses are those caused by ETI's existing\n\n 9            generation resources. The recognition that the CGS program will not result in the\n\n10            displacement of existing resources is a tacit recognition that the program will not\n\n11            reduce the Company's embedded costs left unrecovered by a customer's\n\n12            participation in the program. As Mr. May notes, the only appropriate credits to\n\n13            unrecovered costs are those associated with a reduction in the Company's\n\n14            MSS-1 costs, the Fixed Cost contribution Fee, and the Unserved Energy O&M\n\n15            adder charges.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.       REGARDLESS OF THE VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMING UP CAPACITY,\n\n18            IS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE THAT VALUE TO REDUCE EMBEDDED\n\n19            CAPACITY COSTS?\n\n20   A.       No. To the extent that there is any intrinsic value to be gained by firming up the\n\n21            QF puts (a claim that I rebut in the following section of my testimony), any such\n\n22            value will be largely, if not exclusively, realized through lower fuel costs.

POLLOCK CLAIM THAT THE CGS PROGRAM CAN OFFSET\n\n     12            SOME OF THE COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE CAPABILITY?\n\n     13   A.       Yes. On page 36 of his Supplemental Direct testimony, Mr. Pollock asserts that:\n\n     14                    Firming up 150 MW of QF Puts will reduce the costs associated\n     15                    with flexible capacity [sic]. Based on a review of various studies\n     16                    presented in recent filings, I believe $2 million per year would be a\n     17                    conservative estimate of lower operating costs.\n\n     18            The calculations that Mr. Pollock used to derive this $2 million \"conservative\n\n     19            estimate\" was provided to the Company in a workpaper entitled \"CGS Operating\n\n     20            Cost Benefits.\" I have reproduced Mr. Pollock's calculations from that workpaper\n\n     21            in the following Table 1, although I have also added row numbers and a brief\n\n     22            description of the rows:\n\n\n\n          18\n               Rough Draft of Telephonic Deposition of Jeffry Pollock, dated February 22, 2012 (\"Pollock Depo\") at\n               46.

Mr.\n\n2           Pollock also calculated a value that he labeled \"Percent Affected: which he\n\n3           asserts represents the percentage of the QF puts that would be firmed up under\n\n4           the CGS program.          However, Mr. Pollock's calculation of Percent Affected\n\n5           grossly overstates the amount of QF puts that would be firmed up as a\n\n6           percentage of the total puts. Mr. Pollock then compounds the error by incorrectly\n\n7           applying the \"Percent Affected\" to ETI's total annual sales to determine his\n\n 8          estimate of the potential operating benefit. I will discuss each error in tum.\n\n 9\n\n10   Q.     WHAT ARE THE CRA CBAs?\n\n11   A.     The CRA CBAs are a series of studies that evaluate the costs and benefits that\n\n12          might inure to ratepayers if one or more of the Entergy Operating Companies\n\n13          were to join one of two Regional Transmission Organizations (\"RTO\"):              the\n\n14          Southwest Power Pool (\"SPP\"), or the Midwest Independent Transmission\n\n15          System Operator, Inc. (\"MISO\"). The initial report regarding the CBAs - \"CBA of\n\n16          Entergy and Cleco Power Joining the SPP RTO\" - was released on September\n                                                                         '3S\"0 -1?. -1.\n17          30, 2010. I have attached a copy of that report as Exhibit dSD•1. The Executive\n                                                                          1\\\n18          Summary of that report provides a brief background regarding the study itself:\n\n19                  On June 24, 2009, the FERC and Entergy's retail regulators held a\n20                  technical conference in Charleston, South Carolina that was\n21                  attended by Entergy and many of the entities that purchase and/or\n22                  sell energy in the Entergy region. The FERC agreed to fund a Cost\n23                  Benefit Analysis (\"CBA\"} to study the costs and benefits of Entergy\n24                  and Cleco Power joining the SPP as full transmission-owning\n25                  members with their transmission facilities under SPP operational\n26                  control.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1                    The CBA was performed over a seven-month period, and included\n 2                    an open and collaborative discussion with stakeholders of the study\n 3                    framework, modeling approach, input assumptions, interim results,\n 4                    and qualitative issues throughout this period. 19 Based on the\n 5                    analysis performed, we conclude that Entergy and Cleco Power\n 6                    joining the SPP RTO will yield significant economic benefits to the\n 7                    collective SPP/Entergy region.\n\n 8\n\n 9   a.       WHAT IS THE BASIC METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH UNDERLYING THE\n\n10            CRA CBA ANALYSES?\n\n11   A        CRA collected data on all of the generating facilities and load serving entities\n\n12            located within the Entergy/Cieco Power, SPP, and MISO footprints. 2                   ° CRA then\n13            incorporated this data, along with other data representing the entire eastern\n\n14            interconnection, into the General Electric Multi-Area Production Simulation Model\n\n15            (\"GE MAPS\") model. GE MAPS is a detailed economic dispatch and production\n\n16            costing model that simulates the operation of the electric power system taking\n\n17            into account transmission topology.\n\n18                    Each scenario involved the preparation of two different GE MAPS cases\n\n19            over the 10 year period from 2013 to 2022:\n\n20                    1.       Entergy and Cleco Power continue to operate as they do today\n\n21                             (\"Status Quo Case\"}, and\n\n22                    2.       Entergy and Cleco Power join the SPP RTO (\"Join SPP Case\").\n\n\n\n     19\n          Mr. Pollock did not participate in any of these collaborative stakeholder activities. Pollock Depo at 36.\n     20\n          The \"Entergy region\" refers to the area within the Entergy transmission system footprint, and for\n          purposes of this study includes Louisiana Generating and Louisiana Energy and Power Authority. The\n          \"Cieco region\" refers to the area within the Cleco transmission system footprint as well as the Cleco\n          Power load served by the Entergy transmission system, and for purposes of this study includes the\n          City of Lafayette. The \"SPP region\" refers to the SPP transmission system footprint that is currently\n          operating within the SPP Energy Imbalance Service market.\n\n\n\n                                                          018\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1                   CRA typically presented the results of each scenario as the ten-year net\n\n 2            present value (\"NPV\") difference in the trade benefits between the two cases.\n\n 3            CRA presented results for the Entergy, Cleco, and SPP regions separately, and\n\n 4            the Entergy region trade benefits included the Entergy Operating Companies and\n\n 5            other entities, including, for example, Louisiana Generating, Louisiana Energy\n\n 6            and Power Authority, and Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation, Inc. 21\n\n 7            Trade Benefits are comprised of the production costs produced by the GE MAPS\n\n 8            model for the generating units in the SPP, Cleco and Entergy regions (fuel,\n\n 9           variable O&M and emission costs) plus purchased power costs net of energy\n\n10            sales revenue for each region and \"lost\" transmission revenue.                Transmission\n\n11            charges would not be assessed for transactions between SPP, Entergy and\n\n12            Cleco in the Join SPP Case, yielding reduced or \"lost\" transmission revenue that\n\n13            would have to be compensated for by increased charges to customers.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.       DID CRA PERFORM MORE THAN ONE CBA?\n\n16   A.      Yes. After the initial CBA to evaluate the potential benefits to joining SPP was\n\n17            begun, the alternative of joining the Midwest Independent System Operator, Inc.\n\n18            (\"MISO\") became feasible. That alternative was added to the list of CBAs that\n\n19            CRA was to prepare.          Moreover, and more relevant to this proceeding, the\n\n20            stakeholders requested that CRA perform a number of sensitivity and addendum\n\n21            studies to evaluate the sensitivity of CRAs results to different sets of input\n\n     21\n          CRA Sept 10 CBA at 2. Mr. Pollock incorrectly assumed that the CBA results for \"Entergy\" applied\n          just to the Operating Companies (See Pollock Depo at 35.) Mr. Pollock further admitted that his\n          analysis would be wrong if he mistakenly assumed that the values that CRA reported under \"Entergy\"\n          included more than just the Entergy Operating Companies (Pollock Depo at 36).\n\n\n\n                                                       019\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

The results of these sensitivity and\n\n2             addendum studies were memorialized by CRA in a December 8, 2010 report\n\n3             entitled \"Cost-Benefit Analysis of Entergy and Cleco Power Joining the SPP\n                                                                                          \"l~-R.~\n4             Addendum Study•.         In that report, which is attached as Exhibit J&B-5\", CRA\n\n5             explained that:\n\n6                    During the course of the SPP-Entergy CBA, potentially important\n 7                   parameters worthy of additional analysis were Identified by study\n 8                   stakeholders, including seams charges and the treatment of\n 9                   Entergy QFs. In response, CRA was engaged by Entergy to\n10                   perform an addendum study (\"SPP-Entergy CBA Addendum\"} to\n11                   analyze additional sensitivity cases using the models and input\n12                   assumptions developed under the SPP-Entergy CBA. This\n13                   addendum study was perfonned by CRA over a three-month\n14                   period, and included an open and collaborative discussion with\n15                   stakeholders of the sensitivity analyses to conduct, modeling\n16                   approach, input assumptions, and interim results throughout this\n17                   period.\n\n18                                                          ***\n19                   As trade benefrts are a key determinant in the overall benefits, the\n20                   impact on 2013 trade benefits resulting from alternative\n21                   assumptions in 2013 were the main focus of these addendum\n22                   studies.\n\n23                   The key sources of trade benefits between the Status Quo Case\n24                   and the Join SPP Case are the elimination of commitment and\n25                   dispatch seams charges, the elimination of IPP commitment\n26                   hurdles, and the treatment of QFs as firm resources. 22\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n     22\n          CRA Addendum Study at 3-4.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   l\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK USE      ONE        OF THESE   SENSITIVITIES     IN   THE\n\n 2             PREPARATION OF HIS TESTIMONY?\n\n 3   A.        Yes. He focused on the case in which CRA changed the Status Quo (\"SQ\") case\n\n 4             called \"SQ2: Entergy QFs Firm.\" 23 Mr. Pollock has testified that he thought that\n\n 5             sensitivity \"compared the benefits of firming up the QFs.\" 24 He further testified\n\n 6             that \"the whole purpose of doing the sensitivity study was to measure the\n\n 7             benefits of firming up the QFs.\" 25 It is unclear how or why Mr. Pollock arrived at\n\n 8             that conclusion; CRA itself reported that the purpose of the CRA CBA was to test\n\n 9             the robustness of the finding that there was a potential economic benefit\n\n10             associated with joining the SPP. 26 However, Mr. Pollock, who was not involved\n\n11             in the preparation of the initial CBA or in any of the subsequent addendum or\n\n12             sensitivity studies, misunderstood what that sensitivity was and how the results\n\n13             could be interpreted.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.        WHAT WAS THE SQ2:              ENTERGY QFs FIRM STUDY INTENDED TO\n\n16             ASSESS?\n\n17   Q.        CRA described the basis for this case by initially describing the treatment of QFs\n\n18             in the initial SPP-Entergy CBA:\n\n19                     QF Treatment. As discussed in the SPP-Entergy CBA, upon joining\n20                     an SPP Day 2 RTO, FERC may rule, as it has in other Day 2\n21                     markets, that the Entergy OF put options no longer apply. If so, the\n22                     QFs would have to provide prior notice of self scheduled output to\n\n     23\n          Pollock Depo at 37.\n     24\n          Pollock Depo at 40.\n     25\n          Pollock Depo at 41.\n     26\n          CRA Addendum Study at 3-4.\n\n\n\n                                                     021\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

That is, the QFs would effectively\n 2                     operate as IPPs, albeit with the added limitation of needing to serve\n 3                     their host load. To model this, in the Status Quo Case, the Entergy\n 4                     QFs were treated as \"non-firm\", meaning that the Entergy region is\n 5                     committed day-ahead without QF energy considered. In the Join\n 6                     SPP Case, the Entergy QFs were treated as \"firm\", meaning that\n 7                     the QFs were treated as available for commitment. 27\n\n 8             CRA then described the SQ2: Entergy QFs Firm in Status Quo Case: \"[t]his\n\n 9             sensitivity has QFs treated as firm in both the Status Quo Case and Join SPP\n\n10              Case.\" 28 Thus, SQ2 cannot possibly have measured the difference between\n\n11             treating QF puts as firm versus treating it as non-firm. The fact that the $50\n\n12             million trade benefit value for Entergy was based on a comparison of two\n\n13             scenarios that both treated QFs as firm can be confirmed by looking at Table 4\n\n14             of the December 8 Report, which indicates that both the Status Quo (SQ) 2 case\n\n15             and the Join SPP case assume that QFs are firm. 29 Mr. Pollock observed that \"if\n\n16             you're comparing the status quo case·and the SQ2, the analysis measures the\n\n17             benefits of firming up the QFs\" 30 However, the $50 million reported on Table 5 of\n\n18             the CRA CBA - the $50 million that Mr. Pollock actually used - was not a\n\n19             comparison of the initial status quo case and SQ2. It was instead a measure of\n\n20             the effect of eliminating only the seams charge between the SPP and Entergy\n\n21             regions, and as such cannot be said to determine the value of firming up the QF\n\n22             put.\n\n\n\n\n     27\n          CBA Addendum Study at 7.\n     28\n          CBA Addendum Study at 9 (emphasis added).\n     29\n          CBA Addendum Study at 8.\n     30\n          Pollock Depo at 44.\n\n\n\n                                                      022\n\f                                                                                                  ----   ----------\n\n\n\n\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT IS THE\n\n16          CODA?\n\n17   A.     The CODA was a draft \"Commitment, Operations, and Dispatch Agreemenr that\n\n18          was drafted as a potential replacement for the Entergy System Agreement. It\n\n19          was intended to be a coordinated operating agreement that all of the Operating\n\n20          Companies, including Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Entergy Mississippi, Inc. -\n\n21          companies that have provided notice that they are terminating their participation\n\n22          in the System Agreement - to remain in a coordinated pooling agreement. The\n\n23          CODA was presented to each of the Operating Companies' retail regulators for\n\n24          comment and review, and none of those retail regulators saw enough promise in\n\n25          the CODA to proceed with further negotiations.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

IS THERE ONE SALIENT FEATURE OF THE CODA THAT IS RELEVANT TO\n\n 2             THIS PROCEEDING?\n\n 3   A.        Yes. One of the new and innovative features of the CODA was the introduction\n\n 4             of a \"Flex exchange\" that would equalize the cost of providing flexible capability\n\n 5             across all of the participating Operating Companies.            The nature of the flex\n\n 6             exchange, and an indication of the amount of flex capability that would be\n\n 7             exchanged among the Companies, was described in a presentation made at a\n\n 8             PUCT-sponsored technical conference. Mr. Pollock attached a few pages of that\n\n 9             presentation to the workpapers to his testimony.           I attach the entirety of that\n                                                            ~t> ..f-1{-\n10             presentation to my testimony as Exhibit JS&+.\n\n11\n\n12   Q.        DID MR. POLLOCK USE SOME INFORMATION FROM THAT PRESENTATION\n\n13             TO DERIVE A VALUE USED IN THIS PROCEEDING?\n\n14   A.        He did. Mr. Pollock relied on page 13 (Summary of Differences Between ETI's\n                                                                            3S~-rt-lf'\n15             costs under CODA versus the 5-1 scenario in 2014) of Exhibit dSB-4. In his\n\n16             recent deposition, Mr. Pollock testified:\n\n17                      2                All right. So if you start with that [page 13 slide], you\n18                      3    look at the column called flex cost allocation\n19                      4    differences, I had to eyeball what that is. That\n20                      5    represents the additional flexible capacity costs or\n21                      6    basically energy costs that Entergy would incur because\n22                      7    of its flexible energy requirements a portion of which\n23                      8    is attributable to the PURPA puts. 31\n24\n\n\n\n\n     31\n          Pollock Depo at 48 - 49.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     q\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                             Page23 of26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1   Q.     DOES MR. POLLOCK'S APPROACH PRODUCE A MEANINGFUL RESULT?\n\n 2   A.     No. The fundamental problem is that Mr. Pollock's starting point - the $40 million\n\n 3          that he eyeballs from the graph on page 13- is not a measure of the flexible\n\n 4          capability or energy costs that ETI would incur as a result of its flexible energy\n\n 5          requirements.     Rather, the graph presents a comparison of the costs that ETI\n\n 6          might have incurred while operating in 2014 under the System Agreement\n\n 7          without EAI and the costs that ETI might have expected to incur under the CODA\n\n 8          with all six Operating Companies participating. The bar that he uses as the basis\n\n 9          for his $40 million number is labeled \"Flex Cost Allocation Differences.\" I am\n\n10          perplexed as to how Mr. Pollock could look at those descriptions, especially in\n\n11          the overall context of this presentation, and reach the conclusion that the $40\n\n12          million was some sort of estimate of the cost of flexibility.\n\n13\n\n14   Q.     WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CONTEXT OF THE PRESENTATION IS\n\n15          IMPORTANT?\n\n16   A.     A review o!J. page 3 of the presentation (the entirety of which is attached at Exhibit\n            ~1)-'YI.•,.\n17          ~ may be helpful.

Slide 13 explains that under CODA,\n\n 5          ETI is allocated $40 million more in costs associated with flexibility than it is now\n\n 6          - in other words, under the current System Agreement regime, ETI is short on\n\n 7          flexibility but is not paying the other Operating Companies for that flexibility.\n\n 8\n\n g   a.     DOES THE APPLICATION OF MR. POLLOCK'S APPROACH TO OTHER\n\n10          OPERATING COMPANIES INDICATE THE FUNDAMENTAL FALLACY OF HIS\n\n11          APPROACH?\n\n\n\n\n                                                                026\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                  Page25of26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n1    A.      Yes. First, it is important to note that, as is the case in most forms of energy\n\n2            exchanges, the Flex Exchange sums to zero. That is, the amount of energy that\n\n3            is taken from the exchange exactly equals the amount of energy placed into the\n\n4            exchange. 32 The application of Mr. Pollock's approach would thus suggest that\n\n5            the value of flexible capability for the System is zero. Furthermore, page 14 of\n\n6            the same presentation upon which Mr. Pollock relies indicates that EAI has a\n\n7            negative $25 million Flex Cost Allocation Difference.              The application of Mr.\n\n 8           Pollock's method for valuing flexible capability to EAI would indicate that there is\n\n 9           a negative value, or a cost, associated with firming up the QFs.                That is a\n\n10           nonsensical result.       A valuation method that does not produce consistently\n\n11           meaningful results across companies cannot be relied upon.\n\n12\n\n13   Q.      ARE THERE OTHER FLAWS IN MR. POLLOCK'S CALCULATION?\n\n14   A.      Yes. The next error that I address is the \"Percent Affected• calculation that Mr.\n\n15           Pollock performs.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.      HOW DOES MR. POLLOCK DESCRIBE THE \"PERCENT AFFECTED•\n\n18           NUMBER?\n\n19   A.      Mr. Pollock claims that the Percent Affected number is the percentage of ETI's\n\n20           QF puts that would be eliminated as a result of the implementation of 150 MW of\n\n21           CGS Capacity. 33\n\n\n                                                                               5J.\n     32\n          Mr. Pollock acknowledged this fact in his deposition. Pollock Depo   at~\n     33\n          Pollock Depo at 53.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \\\\\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                      Page 26 of 26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1   Q.       IS MR. POLLOCK'S ASSERTION REASONABLE?\n\n 2   A        No. Mr. Pollock reaches his 31.6% Percent Affected value by assuming that the\n\n 3            150 MW of QF capacity that participates in the CGS program operates at a 100%\n\n 4            load factor. 34 He then multiplies 150 MW by 8, 760 hours per year by two years,\n\n 5           which yields 2,628,000 MWh, which Mr. Pollock then claims is the amount of\n\n 6           energy that would be provided by 150 MW of CGS generation. He then divides\n\n 7           that 2.6 million MWh of generation into 8.2 million MWh, which is the actual\n\n 8           amount of energy that QFs put to ETI over a two year period, to arrive at 31.6%.\n\n 9                   But, comparing one number (his assumed QF put) at an assumed 100%\n\n10           load factor with another number that reflects the actual load factor of the QFs that\n\n11           put to ETI, which is approximately 40%, is like comparing apples to oranges. A\n\n12           more reasonable calculation would be to compare the 150 MW of QF capacity\n\n13           that could potentially be firmed up via the CGS program to the 1 ,825 MW of\n\n14           eligible QF suppliers shown in Mr. Pollock's Exhibit JP-1.                That produces a\n\n15           \"Percent Affected,\" or percent of QF puts that would be potentially firmed up, at\n\n16           less than 12%.\n\n17\n\n18                                            V.

DOES THIS CONCLUDE YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL REBUTTAL TESTIMONY?\n\n20   A       Yes.\n\n\n\n\n     34\n          Which, as Mr. Pollock admitted in deposition, is an assumption inconsistent with the actual facts.\n          Pollock Depo at 52-53.\n\n\n\n                                                       028\n\f                                                                JSD-R-1\n                                                        Docket No. 389~\n                                                            Page 1 of~ \\1\n                                                                     1\n                                                               Page 35\n 1   River analysis looked at?\n 2      A     Well, it's -- the Charles River analysis looked\n 3   at the whole region, but then Entergy took that analysis\n 4   and did a second analysis that showed what the benefits\n s were for just the Entergy -- Entergy operating company.\n 6      Q     Right.   But you took that number from the\n 7   Charles River analysis.     Right?\n 8      A     I think that was the original source, but I'll\n 9 have to check it to make sure.\n10      Q     Well, let me ask you this.        If, in fact, that\n11   reference is from -- to Entergy is from the Charles\n12   River addendum, that's -- refers to the entire Entergy\n13   balancing authority.    Correct?     Not simply the Entergy\n14   operating companies?\n15      A     Well, I don't recall.       There were two studies.\n16   The original study was based on the regions, and then I\n17   think in the evaluation report that was filed by Entergy\n18   at the Commission, they separated the analysis between\n19   Entergy operating companies qnd the other regional\n20   companies.\n21       Q    Well, let me -- let me ask you this.        Is it\n22   correct that if more than just the Entergy operating\n23   companies are included in that number, that\n24   so million-dollar number, or -- I'm sorry -- the sales\n25   number in Row 1, your analysis would be incorrect, would\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                               \\L\n\f                                                                  JSD-R-1\n                                                          Docket No. 38951\n                                                                Page2of~l~\n                                                                  Page 36\n 1   it not?\n 2      A      Well, it -- it -- I mean, the       so million could\n 3   be higher or lower.      Just depends -- I mean, some of the\n 4   benefits went up when you only looked at Entergy only;\n S   but, yeah, if it         if, in fact, the    so million is\n 6   region-wide, then I should have used the            Entergy•s\n 7   operating company specific number, which is the number I\n 8   thought I used.\n 9      Q      All right.\n10      A        I'll have to check it and let you know.\n11      Q      Did you have any involvement with the\n12   development of the Charles River cost benefit analyses?\n13      A        I did not.\n14       Q       So you weren't -- you didn't participate in the\n1S   working group that put those together?\n16      A      No.\n\n17       Q       Did not attend the Entergy Regional State\n18   Committee meetings where they reviewed that modeling and\n19   set it up?\n20      A      No.\n\n21       Q       Have you reviewed the specific addendum study\n22   that that    so million-dollar number was based on?\n23       A       I've read through the study, yes.\n24       Q       All right.

Do you see that?\n 9      A     Yes.\n10      Q     So SQ2 does not reflect the value of firming up\n11   the QF capacity, does it?\n12      A     Okay.    So the SQ is compared to status quo\n13   wait a second.    That's not right, then, because the\n14   status quo case says nonfirm.         So status quo in Table 4\n15   says nonfirm.    SQ2 shows firm.       So that is comparing the\n16   benefit of firming up the QFs.\n17                    I think there's something -- a problem\n18   with the way that's being described.         But if you go back\n19   to Table 4 and you start with the status quo case, that\n20   says \"QFs nonfirm.\"     SQ2 says \"QFs firm.\"      Therefore, it\n21   reflects the benefits of firming up the QFs.\n22       Q    But that's not what it says on Page 7.            It says\n23   that \"This sensitivity has QFs treated as firm in both\n24   the status quo case and join SPP case.\"\n25       A    Well, that's not what Table 4 says.\n\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                               JSD-R·1\n                                                       Docket No. 38951\n                                                           Page5of~(p\n\n                                                              Page 41\n 1       Q      So you -- you think that Charles River got it\n 2   wrong in their description on Page 7?\n 3       A      I think there could be a wrong description or a\n 4   misstatement on page -- on that page because the\n 5   chart -- I mean, the whole purpose of doing the\n                                                                          1\n 6   sensitivity study was to measure the benefits of firming              '\n\n\n\n 7   up the QFs.    In the status quo case, the QFs were not\n 8   firm.   That's what Table 4 says.    And we can read the\n 9   rest of the report.    That's the context in which that\n10   that sensitivity was done is what's the benefit of\n11   firming up QFs.\n12       Q      Well, what Table 4 shows is it starts the\n13   status quo case, then it does sensitivities.      Right?\n14       A      Right.\n15       Q      SQ2 shows that the sensitivity is -- make the\n16   QFs firm in the status quo case.     SQ, status quo.\n17   Correct?\n18       A      Status quo, Sensitivity 2, says --\n19       Q      Firm Entergy QFs.\n20       A      -- makes it firm.\n21       Q      Right?\n22       A      Right.

Right?\n 4         A    No.     I'm comparing the status quo case where\n 5   QFs are nonfirm and SQ2 which the Entergy QFs are firm.\n 6         Q    But Charles River was comparing the status quo\n 7   case with the join SPP case, was it not?\n 8         A    Sure.\n 9         Q    And Status Quo Case 2, which it was comparing\n10   to the join SPP case, had the Entergy QFs firm.            Right?\n11         A    Status Quo 2 has the QFs as firm, yes.\n12         Q    And you compare that to the join SPP case, at\n13   the       they      it also has the QFs firm.     And Page 7\n14   explains it by saying only the seams charges are\n15   different between the two cases.        Isn't that not right?\n16         A    That's what it says.     I understand that.\n17         Q    All right.     But just so we can wrap this up, if\n18   you assume that the QFs are firm in both the status quo\n19   case and in the join SPP case being compared, then your\n20   analysis would be wrong.       Right?\n21         A     Well, the status quo case in Table 4 says QFs\n22   are nonfirm.       So if you're comparing the status quo case\n23   and the SQ2, the analysis measures the benefits of\n24   firming up the QFs.\n25         Q     Can you answer my question?\n                              Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                                  \\I\n\f                                                             JS.D- ~- ..1\n                                                         \\)oc.-~t~o. 3~Gj_\n                                                             \\)tt')e....

WILLIAMS)       Okay.    You know,\n13   Mr. Pollock, your interpretation or explanation of this\n14   document, is that based just on looking at the face of\n15   the document here this afternoon or do you have some\n16   other information that leads you to that interpretation?\n17       A     I've read the reports.          I've read the reports\n18   when they were presented and read the reports when the\n19   company filed its technical report -- technical\n20   evaluation report with the Commission.\n21       Q     Okay.    So it's strictly based on reading the\n22   report?\n23       A     Yes.\n24       Q     Okay.    Going on to Line 3 of Deposition Exhibit\n25   1, there you calculate a dollar per megawatt hour per\n\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                             JSD-R-1\n                                                     Docket No.j8951\n                                                          Page7(   J$\\ /.Q\n                                                             Page 46\n\n 1   unit savings rate.     Why is it appropriate to use a\n 2   calculated capacity benefit of firming up capacity on a\n 3   dollar per megawatt hour, not a dollar per kW basis?\n 4      A      Since we're talking -- we're talking about\n 5   operating cost savings, and so the most -- and in this\n 6   case trade benefits, most of which are production cost,\n 7   most of which is that is fuel.\n 8       Q     Okay.   So these won't     these will be\n 9   produce fuel cost savings mostly.     Is that what you're\n10   saying?\n11      A      I said that the lower operating cost associated\n12   with reduced flexible capacity requirements; so, yes,\n13   there would be changes in operating costs.     It would be\n14   benefits that customers would see immediately in terms\n15   of lower fuel costs.\n16       Q     So these would not change the company's fixed\n17   capacity cost?\n18       A     Over time, they could because the company says\n19   it installs significant amount of flexible capacity in\n20   part to the -- for the -- reflect the PURPA put.        If you\n21   had no PURPA puts, there would be less reserve margin\n22   required; therefore, over time, there would be less\n23   capacity cost.\n24       Q     But you haven't calculated that?    You've\n25   calculated essentially a benefit that flows through fuel\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                               JSD-R-1\n                                                      Docket No.. )89~!.­\n                                                          Page/'..of ~ 1    A\n\n                                                                p.. \\w\n                                                              Page 48\n 1       A     Correct.   That's the work paper.\n 2                  All right.     So if you start with that, you\n 3   look at the column called flex cost allocation\n 4   differences, I had to eyeball what that is.      That\n 5   represents the additional flexible capacity costs or\n 6   basically energy costs that Entergy would incur because\n 7   of its flexible energy requirements, a portion of which\n 8   is attributable to the PURPA puts.\n 9                  I estimated about 20 percent of the -- and\n10   eyeballed the number there -- about 40 million-dollar\n11   impact, so it doesn't -- it only counts the additional\n12   flexible capacity or energy cost that ETI would incur\n13   under the CODA and not the -- kind of didn't count any\n14   of the flexible energy costs that ETI itself would\n15   incur.   This is additional cost that ETI would have to\n16   purchase from the other company.      I determined that\n17   about 20 percent of that 40 million would be\n18   attributable to the PURPA puts.      That's how I got the\n19   8 million.\n20       Q     How did you get 20 percent?\n21       A     I looked at the company's strategic resource\n22   plan and looked at what the resource plan was saying\n23   about variations in load in various different time\n24   periods, and it cited two things.      It cited the\n25   variations due to load swings and also the variations\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                                 2-D\n\f                                                              JSD-R-1\n                                                      Docket No. 38951\n                                                          Page/of '!I.\n                                                                ,o       \\Lt\n                                                             Page 49\n 1   due to the PURPA puts.    If I looked at all four of the\n 2   scenarios, I looked at the variation in the PURPA puts\n 3   to the sum of the variation of the PURPA puts and load\n 4   swing, and you get a number ranging anywhere from the QF\n 5   puts ranging anywhere from 15 to over half of the load\n 6   swings.   So I picked 20 percent.\n 7       Q     Okay.   Now, this analysis is based on\n 8   information related to what's called the CODA.       Right?\n 9       A     Yes.\n10       Q     What is the CODA?\n11       A     Commitment, operating and dispatch agreement,\n12   which was one of the alternatives that Entergy was\n13   considering as a successor to the current system\n14   agreement.\n15       Q     And looking back at the work paper regarding\n16   the summary of differences between ETI's costs under the\n17   CODA versus the 5-1 scenario --\n18       A     Yes.\n19       Q     -- are you saying the $40 million is the --\n20   well, explain to me again.      What are you saying the\n21   $40 million represents?\n22       A     If you look at the bar in the middle, it\n23   says -- under -- where it says \"Flex cost allocation\n24   differences\" and eyeball it, it looks like about -- the\n25   size of the bar is about 40 million.\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                               '2\\\n\f                                                         J\"<;.D-R,;j_\n                                                      DoL-¥-2-* No. 3&q«?:L\n                                                          Va~e.. l\\ of I{P\n                                                               Page 51\n\n1    operating company either has to self-provide or obtain\n2    from other operating companies so that it matches the\n3    amount of flexible capacity that each company requires.\n4                     In this case, ETI would have to spend\n5    about $40 million more than its existing flexible\n 6   capacity resources to meet its flexible capacity\n 7   requirements.\n 8       Q    So you agree that this flex exchange was\n 9   intended to compensate the operating companies that\n10   provide more than their proportioned share of flex --\n11   capability to the system?\n12       A    Yes, with the companies that need it more or\n13   has less than their necessary share of flexible\n14   resources.\n15       Q    Okay.     And so is it correct that a fundamental\n16   design principle for an exchange like this is that the\n17   dollars in megawatts hours in the exchange sum to zero?\n18                    MS.

It's measuring a CGS customer's supply.\n20       Q      Well, do they -- will they -- do you expect a\n21   CGS customer or the CGS supplier to have a hundred\n22   percent load factor for over 24 months?\n23       A      Probably not exactly a hundred percent load\n24   factor, no.\n25       Q      Are you aware of any customer or supplier that\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                               JSD-R-1\n                                                       Docket No. 389~~\n                                                          Page ~of 1-5llt\n                                                              Page 53\n\n 1   has a hundred percent load factor now?\n 2       A      No.\n 3       Q      Line 10 has a -- the data is described as\n 4   percent affected.\n 5       A      Yes.\n 6       Q      And that's Line 8 divided by Line 9.     Right?\n 7       A      Yes.\n 8       Q      What is -- what is that representing, the\n 9   percent affected number?\n10       A      If we had 150 megawatts of QF puts, that would\n11   roughly be about 31.6 percent of all the QF puts that\n12   Entergy Texas bought power from over that 24-month\n13   period.\n14       Q      So you're saying that firming up 150 megawatts\n15   of QF puts would alleviate the flexible capability needs\n16   of a third of ETI's entire annual energy needs?\n17       A      No.    It would eliminate about a third --\n18   31.6 percent of the PURPA put.\n19       Q      So why do you -- so why do you multiply the\n20   percent affected by the total sales?\n21       A      So the average effect is 46 cents a megawatt\n22   hour.     It affects roughly 31.6 percent of the total\n23   sales.    So that's why the value is basically the 46\n24   cents times 31.6 percent times ETI's sales.       That gets\n25   you to 2.3 million.\n\n                             Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                        -rsD-lt-j_\n                                                      Dod'- eJ ~o . 38C.,51...\n                                                           \\)tvj{_   l4   o.C. l i.Q\n                                                                Page 72\n\n1       A      The answer is whatever the power plant is still\n2    providing service, it's providing service to somebody.\n3    It's needed by somebody on the system.\n4        Q     So the CGS contract will not cause me to be\n5    able to reduce those capacity costs associated with that\n 6   generating plant.     Right?\n\n 7       A     Not exactly on the day of the CGS contract; but\n 8   over time, it might.\n\n 9       Q     Well, my hypothetical was year ten of a 40-year\n\n10   power plant life.     There's no CGS contract going to\n11   cause me to shed those capacity costs.       Right?\n12       A      I understand.\n13       Q     Was the answer\n14       A     The company is in a deficit, and so the company\n15   needs additional capacity.       It's that additional\n16   capacity that would be avoided.\n17       Q      Okay.   So we're not talking about historical\n18   we'r~   not talking about avoiding historical embedded\n19   capacity costs with CGS capacity.        We're talking about\n20   the ability to avoid potentially some capacity costs\n21   that's incremental that results --\n\n22       A      Well, not entirely.     No.   Your example was for\n23   power plants.      And, you know, for power plants, you have\n24   a need, and it would be an avoided -- it would be\n25   avoiding another power plant coming in, which would\n\n                             Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                             JSD-R-1\n                                                     Docket No. 389~\n                                                          Page~.

And that's an incremental\n 3       A    There could be -- there could be a purchased\n 4   power agreement that you would otherwise not extend\n 5   because you got this -- you've already met the supply\n 6   deficit with CGS supply.\n 7       Q    Okay.    Well, I bite.   Let's go onto the\n 8   purchased power example.\n 9                    If I have a purchased power contract\n10   that's ten years -- has ten years to run on it when I\n11   enter into a CGS contract, I'm not going to avoid any of\n12   the capacity costs under that purchased power contract\n13   because I entered into a CGS contract.     Right?\n14       A    Not for that specific contract, no; but you\n15   might not enter into a new contract, or you might\n16   enter· -- exit a contract that existed at the time the\n17   rates were set because you didn't need the capacity.\n18   You didn't -- you decided not to extend the term.        I\n19   mean, that's why you enter into some short-term\n20   contracts.\n21       Q    Yeah.    And assuming you had the right to get\n22   out of that contract?\n23      A     Oh, contracts have a specific term.        Sometimes\n24   there's one year.     Sometimes it's three years.\n25   Sometimes it's ten years.     At the end of one year, three\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                                    JSD·R-1\n                                                           Docket No. :}8951\n                                                               Page)'! of)'!,\n                                                                    \\\\1 \\\\1\n                                                                   Page 74\n\n 1    years, ten years, you can      deci~e   to renew it or not.\n 2    It's not a question of breaking a contract.

Specifically, Mr. Dingle also addresses the 24/7 firm nature of\n\n 11              the CGS product and how that affects the Unserved Energy rate, which I\n\n12               also address in part. In addition, Mr. Dingle addresses issues regarding\n\n13               the Entergy System Agreement and the Entergy Operating Committee's\n\n14               role and authority under that agreement; how the CGS program could be\n\n15               affected by ETI's integration into the Midwest Transmission System\n\n16               Operator; termination payments should the CGS Supplier or CGS\n\n17               Customer default in their obligations to provide CGS supply for the entire\n\n18               contracted period; the process for initiating CGS service; and TIEC's\n\n19               proposed \"force majeure\" provision for the CGS Purchase Agreement.\n\n20\n\n21        Q.    WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE PURPOSE OF THE\n\n22              CGS PROGRAM?\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                        Page 5 of 23\n          Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1   A.     The tentative terms and conditions that address how the CGS program\n\n     2           would work are included in Section I of the CGS Stipulated Matters and\n\n     3           Stipulated Facts filed by the parties to this proceeding on January 20,\n\n     4           2012. In this answer, I will explain the primary (but not all) provisions of\n\n     5           the program as laid out in those stipulations.\n\n     6                  The CGS program, in accordance with PURA § 39.452 and as\n\n     7           proposed to be structured by the parties, is intended to provide a specific\n\n     8           subset of customers (CGS Customers) within ETI's Large Industrial Power\n\n     9          Service (LIPS) Rate Schedule class with the ability, consistent with the\n\n 10             requirements of federal law and FERC tariffs including the Entergy System\n\n 11             Agreement, to obtain generation service from an alternative supplier. In\n\n12              order to accomplish this objective, to address the Commission's concerns\n\n13              regarding cost shifting under the program, and to address other significant\n\n14              limitations imposed by the legislation (including the requirement that the\n\n15              CGS program not create a conflict with Federal law), the parties to this\n\n16              proceeding have engaged in extensive negotiations and arrived at a\n\n17              tentative solution to at least some aspects of the CGS program design.\n\n18                     Under this collaborative proposal, customers eligible for CGS\n\n19              service will contract with a CGS Supplier, which must be a Qualified\n\n20              Facility (\"QF\") as defined by Rate Schedule LQF that is or will be\n\n21             interconnected to       ETI,   for a     negotiated level of CGS       capacity\n22             (Supplier-Customer Contract).         ETI will not be a party to this contract;\n23             however,      the    Supplier/QF       (\"CGS   Supplier\"),   based    on    the\n\n                                                9^\n\f             Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n             Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1              Supplier-Customer Contract, will then enter into a CGS Purchase\n\n 2                  Agreement with the Company for the same level of capacity as in the\n\n 3                  Supplier-Customer Contract.             As further discussed in Mr. Dingle's\n\n 4                  Supplemental Direct Testimony, the capacity supplied by the CGS\n\n 5                  Purchase Agreement will take the form of a 24/7 unit contingent product.\n\n 6                  Mr. Dingle also explains, upon fulfillment of other conditions addressed in\n\n 7                  his testimony in a manner satisfactory to the Entergy Operating\n\n 8                  Committee, that Committee has agreed to recognize that the CGS\n\n 9                  Purchase Agreement can provide firm capacity (or, in the terms of the\n\n10                  Entergy System Agreement, \" capability\") to the Entergy System.3\n\n11                          ETI will not make a capacity payment directly to the CGS Supplier.\n\n12                  Instead, ETI will provide a credit to the CGS Customer equal to ETI's\n\n13                  non-fuel embedded generation cost (measured in $/kW/month) for that\n\n14                 customer times the CGS Supplied Capacity (kW). Any compensation for\n\n15                 the CGS capacity to the CGS Supplier is paid by the CGS Customer\n\n16                 pursuant to the terms of a separate Supplier-Customer Contract.\n\n17\n\n18       Q.        IS THE INTENT OF THE CGS PROGRAM TO CREATE A CAPACITY\n\n19                 MARKET FOR ETI?\n\n\n\n\n         3     By providing this testimony, ETI does not in any manner waive its rights to fully contest and\n               independently assert its rights regarding any and all matters that remain in dispute among the\n               parties. ETI presents this testimony solely for the purpose of facilitating the Commission's\n               resolution of the issues listed above.\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 7 of 23\n          Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1    A.     No.      As explained by Mr. Dingle, the CGS program is not intended, or\n\n     2           needed, as a means to fulfill ETI's resource needs and the Company\n\n     3           would oppose any effort to place a value on CGS capacity based on an\n\n     4           alleged resource need for the program.              To the contrary, the CGS\n     5           program, as I noted above, is designed as a means whereby a limited\n\n     6           class of eligible customers could gain access to an alternative source of\n\n     7           generation apart from that offered by ETI.\n\n     8                    The Entergy system has planned for and acquired, and will\n\n     9          continue to plan for and acquire, short-term, limited-term and long-term\n\n 10             resources needed by ETI to reliably serve its Texas customers. However,\n\n11              if implemented properly and consistent with applicable legal requirements,\n\n12              the CGS program could provide a modest amount of additional capacity\n\n13              for the Entergy System.           As discussed below and in Mr. Dingle's\n14              testimony, however, this resource would come with limitations.\n\n15\n\n16                 III.     NON-FUEL EMBEDDED GENERATION COST CREDIT\n17       Q.     WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF THE LIPS NON-FUEL EMBEDDED\n\n18              GENERATION          COSTS THAT           WILL   BE     CREDITED TO CGS\n19              CUSTOMERS AS PART OF THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n20       A.     The LIPS non-fuel embedded generation costs derived from the rates\n\n21              recently set by the Commission in ETI's most recent base rate Docket\n\n22             No. 39896 is $6.33 per kW per month. The order approving new rates in\n\n23             Docket No. 39896 became final in mid-December 2012 and the new rates\n\n\n                                                  ^^\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 8 of 23\n         Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n         Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1          relate back to service rendered on and after June 30, 2012. As a result,\n\n     2          the LIPS non-fuel embedded generation costs figure that has been\n\n     3          addressed in prior filings in this docket should be changed from the $6.84\n\n     4          per kW per month that resulted from the prior rates approved in ETI\n\n     5          Docket No. 37744 to the $6.33 per kW per month derived from the more\n\n     6          recent Docket No. 39896. A schedule showing how the $6.33 per kW per\n\n     7          month non-fuel embedded cost figure is derived is attached as my Exhibit\n\n     8          DRR-SD-1. The $6.84 per kW value resulting from Docket No. 37744,\n\n 9              and agreed to by all parties to this docket, was developed by taking the\n\n10              LIPS class non-fuel embedded production cost from the Company's\n\n11              rebuttal cost of service and scaling this value down based on the\n\n12              difference between the LIPS non-fuel total revenue requirement resulting\n\n13             from the settlement in Docket No. 37744 and the LIPS non-fuel total\n\n14             revenue requirement from the Company's rebuttal cost of service. The\n\n15             resulting scaled value was then divided by the LIPS billing demand to\n\n16             develop the LIPS non-fuel embedded production cost on a $/kW basis.\n\n17             This scaling was necessary because the settlement from Docket No.\n\n18             37744 did not identify the functional revenue requirement by rate class. A\n\n19             similar situation exists now as a result of ETI's most recent base rate case\n\n20             (Docket No. 39896) because the Staff's cost of service number running\n\n21             model from Docket No. 38986 also does not identify the functional\n\n22             revenue requirement by rate class.           As shown on my attached Exhibit\n23             DRR-SD-1, and its supporting work papers, a similar process was used to\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

This change to $6.33 per kW per month should be\n\n     3          made in Section VI.B. of Schedule CGS, which is Exhibit DRR-SD-2 to my\n\n     4          testimony.     As currently written, that section acknowledges that the\n\n     5          $6.84 figure should be updated to the current applicable non-fuel\n\n     6          embedded generation cost figure.\n\n     7\n\n     8   Q.     BY AGREEING THAT $6.33 PER KW PER MONTH SHOULD BE\n\n     9          CREDITED TO CGS CUSTOMERS, IS ETI MAKING ANY CONCESSION\n\n10              REGARDING          THE      DETERMINATION      OF      THE    COMPANY'S\n11             \"UNRECOVERED COSTS\" RESULTING FROM THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n12       A.    No.     The Interim Order issued by the Commission in this Docket\n\n13             No. 38951 on June 12, 2012 concluded, on an interim basis, that the\n\n14             non-fuel embedded generation costs avoided by the CGS customer are\n\n15             not included within the meaning of the phrase \" unrecovered costs\" to the\n\n16             Company as that phrase is used in PURA § 39.452(b). I understand that\n\n17             that is the Commission's interim ruling, and my testimony here is limited to\n\n18             identifying the level of the LIPS credit that would be provided to the CGS\n\n19             Customers under the CGS rider. By providing this testimony, ETI is not\n\n20             waiving its right to contest the Commission's ruling as to what is and what\n\n21             is not an \" unrecovered cost\" under PURA § 39.452(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                                l,Q,\n\f           Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE NATURE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE\n\n     3            UNSERVED ENERGY RATE INCLUDED IN THE CGS PROGRAM.\n\n     4     A.     The unserved energy rate is covered in Section VII of the CGS rider, and\n\n     5            is included in both the Company's (Exhibit No. DRR-SD-2) and TIEC's\n\n     6            proposed riders. ETI charges the CGS Customer under this rate when the\n\n     7            CGS Supplier fails to provide the contracted CGS capacity that is intended\n\n     8            to be made available on a 24/7 basis to serve the CGS Customers.\n\n     9            Charging the unserved energy rate allows ETI to recover the costs of\n\n 10              continuing to serve the CGS Customer when the CGS Supplier fails to\n\n 11              deliver. By implementing an Unserved Energy rate, other customers are\n\n12               protected because they are not then burdened with bearing the cost of the\n\n13               energy that ETI must provide to make up for the lack of CGS supply. This\n\n14               is also why the revenues from the Unserved Energy are credited to ETI's\n\n15               fuel balance-to ensure that other customers are not being harmed when\n\n16               a CGS Supplier fails to deliver its contracted supply.\n\n17\n\n18        Q.     PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SECOND ISSUE THAT YOU ADDRESS: TIEC'S\n\n19               PROPOSAL TO ALLOW A CGS CUSTOMER TO REDUCE ITS LOAD\n\n20               TO MATCH A DECREASE IN DELIVERIES BY THE CGS SUPPLIER,\n\n21              AND THEREBY AVOID UNSERVED ENERGY CHARGES.\n\n22        A.    TIEC's proposed CGS rider, at the end of the first sentence in Section VII,\n23              \"Unserved Energy,\" includes the words:            \"less any corresponding\n\n                                                  to\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1          reduction in the CGS Customer's electricity usage.\" I understand this\n\n     2           phrase to mean that a CGS Customer would be allowed to reduce its load\n\n     3           to match a corresponding reduction in its CGS Supplier's deliveries to ETI,\n\n     4           and thereby potentially avoid unserved energy charges.          ETI does noi\n     5           agree with TIEC's proposal to allow the CGS Customer to avoid unserved\n\n     6           energy payments in this manner.             Company witness Dingle addresses\n     7           certain aspects of this issue in support of ETI's position.\n\n     8                  In addition to Mr. Dingle's points, this proposal by TIEC is\n\n     9          unworkable for a number of reasons related to metering and tracking. If\n 10             TIEC's proposal were adopted:\n\n 11                     (1) ETI has no way to know that a reduction in a Customer's load is\n 12             for economic reasons, rather than because of a reduction in the\n\n13              Customer's CGS Supplier's supply;\n\n14                     (2) Entergy's System Operations Center real-time system does not\n15              meter customers' consumption (CGS or otherwise). Because there is no\n16              real-time data as to both the CGS Customers and CGS Suppliers, there is\n17              not a reliable method for a CGS Supplier to notify its CGS Customer(s)\n18             that it is reducing its supply;\n\n19                     (3) In the situation of one CGS Supplier serving multiple CGS\n20             Customers, when the CGS Supplier reduces its supply, there is no method\n21             for prioritizing the reduction to the multiple Customers, and therefore no\n22             method for determining which CGS Customer should avoid unserved\n23             energy charges or the level of required reduction; and\n\n\n                                                 i^\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1                  (4) In the reverse situation-one CGS Customer with multiple CGS\n\n     2           Suppliers-all hierarchy rules as to CGS and non-CGS supplies from the\n\n     3           Supplier are set by the Supplier, and ETI has no way of knowing how to\n\n     4           allocate the reduction in the Customer's load to multiple CGS Suppliers.\n\n     5           As a consequence of these various uncertainties, there is no way to\n\n     6           reliably match a CGS supply reduction to a CGS customer load reduction.\n\n     7                  In addition to the metering and tracking-related implications that I\n\n     8          just described, Mr. Dingle also notes that the CGS program is intended to\n\n     9          result in a 24/7 firm product, and the 80% capacity factor built in to the\n\n 10             CGS program is intended to cover potential unavoidable reductions in\n\n 11             CGS Supplier deliveries to ETI. If the CGS Customer is also allowed to\n\n12              reduce its load to offset any reduction in CGS supply, the \"firmness\" of the\n\n13              CGS program, and the very basis for treating the CGS Supplier's\n\n14              deliveries as firm capacity, is compromised. If the CGS program in fact\n\n15              results in a non-firm capacity product from a CGS Supplier, then the\n\n16              Entergy Operating Committee may well determine that it cannot treat that\n\n17              CGS Supplier's CGS capacity as firm and will thereby need to plan to\n\n18              serve that Supplier's CGS Customer(s) with Entergy System capacity,\n\n19              rather than CGS capacity, thus nullifying the core intent of the program as\n\n20             to that Supplier and its CGS Customers.\n\n21                     As noted, ETI must stand ready to serve the CGS Customer\n\n22             regardless of what the CGS Supplier delivers to ETI. The solution to\n\n23             TIEC's issue is for the CGS Customer and its CGS Supplier to agree to\n\n\n                                                   I„-5-\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

The Commission should reject TIEC's unworkable\n\n     3          proposal to allow a CGS customer to match a reduction in CGS supply to\n\n     4          a corresponding reduction in the Customer's load\n\n     5\n\n     6         V.  TIEC'S PROPOSED RIDER CGSC DOES NOT ALLOW ETI TO\n     7        RECOVER ITS CGS IMPLEMENATION AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS\n     8   Q.     PLEASE ADDRESS ETI'S CONCERNS WITH TIEC'S PROPOSED\n\n 9              RIDER SCHEDULE CGSC.\n\n10       A.     Rider CGSC establishes the formula and method by which ETI would\n\n11              recover its costs of implementing and administering the CGS program.\n\n12             TIEC's version and ETI's version of Rider CGSC are very different. ETI's\n\n13             version is attached as my Exhibit DRR-SD-3. TIEC's version is attached\n\n14             to its November 27, 2012 Motion filed in this docket.\n\n15                     TIEC's Rider CGSC fails to carry out the requirement of PURA\n\n16             § 39.452(b) that ETI incur no \"unrecovered costs\" in connection with the\n\n17             CGS program. TIEC's proposal erroneously:\n\n18                 •   eliminates virtually all recovery of implementation costs prior to the\n19                     date the Commission approves the program (save for a small\n20                     amount included in ETI's most recently established base rates)\n21                     (TIEC CGSC Rider Sections II, IV, and V);\n22                 •   makes no provision for ETI recovery of implementation costs to the\n23                     extent there are no CGS subscribers;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   /I/\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

The\n     7                      parties have previously agreed that revenues only from the variable\n     8                      O&M portion of the Unserved Energy rate are to be used to reduce\n     9                      unrecovered costs. The parties have further previously agreed that\n 10                         other revenues from the Unserved Energy rate are to be used to\n 11                         reduce reconcilable fuel costs;\n 12                    •    applies revenues from the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee to offset\n 13                         and reduce the recovery of CGS program implementation and\n 14                         administrative costs. (TIEC Rider CGSC, Attachment A).\n 15\n16       Q.     WHAT IS ETI'S POSITION WITH REGARD TO CGSC COSTS\n17              INCURRED PRIOR TO THE DATE THE COMMISSION APPROVES THE\n18              CGS PROGRAM?\n19       A.     For purposes of the current CGS proposal, ETI has been incurring costs to\n20              implement this CGS program since 2009 when it proposed the basis for\n21              the current CGS proposal in its base rate case filing in Docket No. 37744.\n22             The current Docket No. 38951 was severed from Docket No. 37744 and\n23             has proceeded since then to result in the CGS riders now at issue before\n24             the Commission.         ETI will continue to incur those implementation costs\n25             until       the   program   commences,         and then will incur costs to\n26             administer/operate the program once the Commission issues its order\n\n27             directing ETI to proceed with the program.            ETI should recover these\n\n\n\n                                                      (?\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n         Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1          costs-including historical, current, and future implementation costs-as\n\n     2          well as administering the CGS program once it is approved.\n\n     3                  Specifically,   ETI    proposes that its initial annual program\n\n     4          implementation and operation costs be established at a level of $940,500,\n\n     5          as addressed in Company witness Phillip May's testimony filed in ETI\n\n 6              Docket No. 37744 filed on December 30, 2009, Exhibit PRM-1. However,\n\n 7              to show the Rider CGSC calculation for illustrative purposes, ETI is\n\n 8              deducting $310,746 from the $940,500.          This illustration is shown on\n\n 9              Attachment A to Rider CGSC (Exhibit DRR-SD-3). The $310,746 is the\n\n10              amount of affiliate-related costs charged to the CGS Project Code during\n\n11              the Docket No. 39896 test year, and now included in ETI's current base\n\n12              rates as a result of the Commission's order in that case. Thus, ETI is not\n\n13             double recovering these CGSC-related costs through both current base\n\n14             rates    and     ETI's   proposed    Rider   CGSC.    As also shown on\n15             Exhibit DRR-SD-3, ETI has also deducted an assumed (for illustrative\n\n16             purposes) $20,000 attributable to the \"Rider CGSC Unserved Energy\n\n17             Variable O&M Charge,\" for a total Rider CGSC Recovery Amount of\n\n18             $619,254.      To derive the Rider CGSC rate for the following year, the\n\n19             CGSC Recovery Amount would be divided by the CGS or LIPS class kW\n\n20             for the prior year. This initial Rider CGSC rate would be proposed some\n\n21             months after the Commission approves a CGS Program, but ETI cannot\n\n22             identify precisely when that filing would be made until it has a Commission\n\n23             order in hand.\n\n\n                                                    17\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT IS ETI'S POSITION WITH REGARD TO TIEC'S \"INCREMENTAL\"\n\n     2           COST RECOVERY PROPOSAL?\n\n     3   A.      In Section II of its version of the CGSC rider, TIEC defines \"incremental\"\n\n     4           costs as reasonable and necessary costs incurred by ETI \"following\" the\n\n     5           Commission's approval of the CGS Program.          Through this definition,\n 6               TIEC is proposing that ETI not recover any of its implementation costs\n\n 7               incurred prior to the date the Commission approves the CGS Program.\n\n 8               ETI disagrees with that position because it would result in ETI not\n\n 9              recovering those unrecovered costs, contrary to PURA § 39.452.\n\n10\n\n11       Q.     SHOULD RIDER CGSC ACCOUNT FOR A POTENTIAL SITUATION IN\n12              WHICH THERE ARE NO CGS SUBSCRIBERS?\n\n13       A.     Yes.   TIEC's proposed Rider CGSC does not account for this potential\n14              situation. In that situation, ETI will, nevertheless, have incurred costs to\n\n15              implement the program even if no Customers subscribe. These would be\n\n16              \"unrecovered\" implementation and administrative costs, which ETI is\n\n17              entitled to recover in accordance with PURA § 39.452, as is provided for in\n\n18              ETI's proposed Rider CGSC. ETI's proposal is that, if there are no CGS\n\n19             subscribers, these costs would be recovered from all customers taking\n20             service under Rate Schedules LIPS and LIPS Time-of-Day.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      i^\n\f               Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                Page 17 of 23\n               Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n               Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1        Q.        SHOULD ETI RECOVER INTEREST ON THE FUNDS ITS EXPENDS TO\n\n     2                   IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER THE CGS PROGROM PRIOR TO\n\n     3                  RECOVERING THOSE COSTS THROUGH RIDER CGSC?\n\n     4        A.        Yes.    As noted above, there is a time value of money associated with\n\n     5                  ETI's expenditures between the time those expenditures are made and\n\n     6                  when they are actually recovered through Rider CGSC. ETI's proposed\n\n     7                  Rider CGSC, therefore, includes a cumulative interest line item to account\n\n     8                  for this value.4\n\n     9\n\n 10           Q.        SHOULD ALL REVENUES RECEIVED BY ETI UNDER THE UNSERVED\n\n 11                     ENERGY RATE PROVISION BE USED TO REDUCE THE RIDER CGSC\n12                      COSTS?\n\n13            A.        No. The parties have agreed that the structure of the rate for Unserved\n\n14                     Energy will include an agreed energy charge and an agreed Operation\n\n15                     and Maintenance (O&M) adder.              The monthly CGS Unserved Energy\n16                     charge will be the sum of (a) hourly Unserved Energy times 105% of the\n17                     system hourly avoided energy costs for ETI for the current month and\n18                     (b) the hourly CGS Unserved Energy times specified variable O&M\n19                     charges. This agreement is memorialized in both the \"Agreed List of\n20                     Settled Issues\" filed in Docket No. 38951 on November 1, 2011 at page 2,\n21                     Paragraph C. and in the \"CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\"\n\n          °        TIEC deleted any reference to interest in the body of Rider CGSC, though it did leave a\n                   reference to \"cumulative interest\" in Attachment A to its proposed rider. Thus, the intent\n                   regarding the treatment of interest is not clear.\n\f             Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                Page 18 of 23\n             Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n             Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1                 filed in this docket on January 20, 2012 at pages 2-3. The document\n\n 2                     provides that revenues from the variable O&M portion of the Unserved\n\n 3                     Energy rate will be used to offset unrecovered costs.5 But that stipulation\n\n 4                     also provides that the revenues from the portion of the rate that is based\n\n 5                     on system avoided energy charges will go towards offsetting ETI's eligible\n\n 6                     fuel costs.6 Thus, to maintain consistency with the parties' agreement, not\n\n 7                     all revenues from the Unserved Energy rate are used to offset the CGSC\n\n 8                     costs-only revenues the variable O&M charges are used for that\n\n 9                     purpose, and is necessary to help prevent other non-participating\n\n10                    customers from subsidizing the CGS Program.\n\n11\n\n12                                   VI.    FIXED COST CONTRIBUTION FEE\n13           Q.       WHAT IS THE \"FIXED COST CONTRIBUTION FEE\"?\n\n14       A.           This fee is a fixed dollar per kW charge paid on a monthly basis to ETI by\n\n15                    a CGS customer as part of the compensation ETI receives to provide CGS\n\n16                    service. This fee is referenced in Section VI of the CGS rider proposed by\n\n17                    both TIEC and ETI.\n\n\n\n\n                  This may be a typographical error. It is possible that TIEC intended to reference variable\n                  O&M revenue only from the unserved energy rate as being used to reduce the unrecovered\n                  implementation and administrative costs. See \"CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\"\n                  at page 3, Item F.5.\n         6        See CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts at page. 3, Item and F.6. To reduce\n                  remaining controversy among the parties, ETI has conformed its rider to TIEC's proposal to\n                  use the variable O&M revenue to offset CGS implementation and administration costs.\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT IS TIEC'S PROPOSAL REGARDING THE USE OF THE FIXED\n\n 2                 CONTRIBUTION FEE?\n\n 3   A.            In Section VI.A. of its proposed CGS rider, TIEC proposes that \"Revenues\n\n 4                 received from this fee will reduce ETI's Rate Schedule CGSC charges.\"\n\n 5\n\n 6   Q.            WHY SHOULD THE $1.10 per kW FIXED COST CONTRIBUTION FEE\n\n 7                 NOT BE USED TO REDUCE RIDER CGSC COSTS?\n\n 8   A.           As recognized by TIEC, the Office of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC), and\n\n 9                the Cities in this docket, the $1.10 per kW Fixed Cost Contribution Fee is\n\n10                 intended to compensate ETI for standing ready to serve the CGS\n\n11                Customer.' This $1.10 fee was intended to offset unrecovered production\n\n12                costs, not unrecovered implementation and administration costs.                      This\n13                point is addressed in the \"Agreed List of Settled Issues\" filed in this docket\n\n     '         The citations to TIEC's OPUC's, and the Cities' testimony on this point are: Direct Testimony\n               of TIEC witness Jeffry Pollock at page 16, lines 3-11: \"The costs of backup power will be\n               paid for by CGS Customers through the Unserved Energy Rate and a Fixed Cost\n               Contribution Fee referenced in the Stipulation. Unserved Energy will be priced at 105% of\n               avoided energy cost plus an O&M Adder. This is similar to how ETI currently prices backup\n               power in Schedule SMS. In addition, the CGS Customer will be required to pay a Fixed Cost\n               Contribution Fee of $1.10 per kW-Month of CGS Contract Capacity.

PLEASE BRIEFLY DESCRIBE EACH OF THESE RIDERS.\n\n     8    A.    Rider CGS is the schedule that sets out the CGS program. It is attached\n\n     9          as my Exhibit DRR-SD-2. Rider CGS addresses: the availability of CGS\n 10             service; who is eligible for this service; how CGS service is initiated;\n\n 11             tracking certifications; termination events and rights; billing; unserved\n 12             energy; metering; and reporting requirements.    Rider CGS also includes\n 13             an \"Appendix A,\" which sets out the general terms and conditions that\n14              would apply to an ETI-Supplier Contract. ETI had intended that a form of\n15              the ETI-Supplier Contract would have been developed and filed with these\n16              Riders, but ETI and TIEC were unable to agree to such a form contract.\n17                       I have generally described Rider CGSC above.        This Rider,\n18             attached as Exhibit DRR-SD-3, sets out the recovery of ETI's CGS\n19             implementation and administration costs.         This Rider includes an\n20             \"Attachment A\" that sets out the proposed CGSC rate for illustrative\n21             purposes.       The Company's intention would be to file a revised Rider\n22             CGSC when the costs of developing and administering the ultimate CGS\n23             program are known.\n\n\n\n                                                -^ Y\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

ON PAGE 9 OF HIS SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECT TESTIMONY,\n\n14            TIEC WITNESS JEFFRY POLLOCK STATES THAT \"TIEC'S PROPOSED\n\n15            [CGS] TARIFF COMPORTS WITH THE PARAMETERS OF THE CGS\n\n16            PROGRAM AS DISCUSSED IN THE PRIOR STIPULATIONS AND IN\n\n17            THE INTERIM ORDER, AND IT PROVIDES A WORKABLE PROCESS\n\n18            FOR INITIATING CGS SERVICE.\" HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n19    A.      While I agree that ETI and TIEC (along with the Staff and other parties)\n\n20             have made significant progress in resolving many contentious and\n\n21             complex issues, TIEC's version of Rider CGS does not comply with the\n\n\n      '    ESI is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that provides technical and administrative services\n           to all the Entergy Operating Companies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           final sentence in PURA § 39.452(b) because it would be contrary to \"an\n\n2           applicable decision, rule or policy statement of a federal regulatory\n\n3           authority having jurisdiction\" (that is, the Federal Energy Regulatory\n\n4           Commission) as discussed by Company witness Dingle. In addition,\n\n5           TIEC's version of Rider CGS should be rejected for the reasons discussed\n\n6            in Mr. Dingle's Supplemental Direct and Second Supplemental Rebuttal\n\n7            Testimony, as well as my Supplemental Direct and this Supplemental\n\n 8           Rebuttal Testimony.\n\n 9\n\n10   Q.      ON PAGES 25-26 OF HIS SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECT\n\n11           TESTIMONY, MR. POLLOCK ASSERTS THAT THE RIDER CGSC\n\n12           (IMPLEMENTATION           AND ONGOING ADMINISTRATION COSTS)\n\n13           SHOULD APPLY TO COSTS INCURRED ONLY AFTER THAT RIDER IS\n\n14           APPROVED AND THAT ETI IS ALREADY RECOVERING LEGAL AND\n\n15           REGULATORY COSTS RELATED TO THE CGS PROGRAM THROUGH\n\n16           ETI'S BASE RATES. HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n17    A.     ETI is and has been incurring costs to implement the CGS Program since\n\n18           prior to November 10, 2010, which is the date the PUCT severed the CGS\n\n19           Program from Docket No. 37744 to establish this docket. ETI, however, is\n\n20           requesting recovery of its implementation costs only from that November\n\n21            10, 2010 date forward.       There is no way that ETI could put the CGS\n\n22            Program into effect without incurring these implementation costs:      we\n\n23           would not have a proposed tariff, much less completed all of the drafts,\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                 Page 3 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           analyses, and discussions necessary to work through the myriad complex\n\n2            issues that have brought us just to this point. In addition, TIEC's assumed\n\n3            recovery via base rates in Docket No. 39896 did not begin until June\n\n4            2012, which is long after costs started being incurred. There is no doubt\n\n5            that, under TIEC's approach, these implementation costs would go\n\n6            \"unrecovered\" if ETI were not allowed to collect them. My understanding\n\n 7           is that the PUCT has concluded, on an interim basis, that \"unrecovered\n\n 8           costs\" are the \"costs to implement and administer the CGS program tariff.\"\n\n 9           (Interim Order at page 6.) TIEC's approach would allow only recovery of\n\n10           the costs of administering the tariff.\n\n11                   As to Mr. Pollock's second point, yes, there is an amount\n\n12           attributable to ETI's work on the CGS Program that was used to set\n\n13           current base rates. But ETI is proposing, in its Rider CGSC, to credit the\n\n14           amount used to set current retail base rates ($299,372)2 to the ultimate\n\n15           Rider CGSC rate. For a further discussion about what was included in the\n\n16           setting of base rates and if it is determined that something else should be\n\n17           done, how to avoid rate class subsidy issues, please refer to Section IV of\n\n18           this testimony below where I respond to OPUC's testimony on this issue.\n\n19\n\n\n\n      2 ETI's Rider CGSC should have only credited the retail portion included in base rates of\n         $299,372 because that is the level authorized for recovery in current retail rates and not the\n         full $310,746. The difference between the two figures is the amount allocated to the\n         wholesale class.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  );5\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 4 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1    Q.     ON PAGE 26, MR. POLLOCK CONTENDS THAT THE $1.10 FIXED\n\n2           COST CONTRIBUTION FEE SHOULD BE USED TO REDUCE THE\n\n3           \"UNRECOVERED COSTS,\" THAT IS, THE COSTS TO BE COLLECTED\n\n4           THROUGH RIDER CGSC. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n5    A.     No. I addressed this point in some detail in my Supplemental Direct\n\n6           Testimony.      Mr. Pollock is correct if the PUCT had concluded that\n\n 7          \"unrecovered costs\" included ETI's unrecovered embedded production\n\n 8          costs, but it did not. The fixed cost contribution fee is necessary for ETI\n\n 9           standing ready to provide service to the CGS Customer regardless of\n\n10          whether the Customer's CGS Supplier delivers its contracted supply to\n\n11           ETI. ETI should be allowed to retain this fee in order to at least contribute\n\n12           to, if not cover, the incremental cost incurred by the Company to stand by\n\n13           to serve this load. Staff witness Mendoza came to this same conclusion in\n\n14           his January 25, 2013 testimony by referring to the Agreed List of Settled\n\n15           Issues that state that the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee \"will be applied to\n\n16           offset any production costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation\n\n17           of the CGS tariff.\"3\n\n18\n\n19   Q.

This is another situation in which TIEC is attempting to put off an important\n\n4             and real issue, and thereby place at risk ETI's ability to recover these\n\n5             costs. Once again, TIEC has responded to an ETI request for information\n\n6             that it does not keep records of which of its members have even\n\n 7            expressed an interest in the CGS Program-TIEC cannot name even one\n\n 8            of its members (also ETI customers and/or Qualifying Facilities \"QFs\")\n\n 9            who are interested.    My attached Exhibit DRR-SR-1 is a copy of TIEC's\n\n10            responses on this point.     Staff witness Mendoza has agreed with ETI's\n\n11            proposal and that \"In the event no customers subscribe to the CGS\n\n12            program, any unrecovered costs should be borne by the customer class it\n\n13            was designed to potentially benefit.\"4 Further, the costs incurred by ETI to\n\n14             implement the CGS Program to date are $945,100 for the period\n\n15             December 2010 through November 2012, which the Company reported to\n\n16            TIEC in response to TIEC 4-4 subpart (a). This response is attached as\n\n17             my Exhibit DRR-SR-2. This value is certainly not di minimis. There is no\n\n18             valid reason to not address this issue now as an important component of\n\n19             the CGS Program.\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n     4 Id. at 9.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK ALSO ASSERTS THAT ETI\n\n2           SHOULD       NOT     ACCRUE        INTEREST    ON THE UNRECOVERED\n\n3           BALANCE OF THE RIDER CGSC CHARGES. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n4    A.     No.    Mr. Pollock analogizes this requested interest recovery to what he\n\n5           refers to as the typical practice regarding rate case expenses.      This is not\n\n6           a \"typical\" case; it is instead a case subject to a specific statutory provision\n\n 7          that applies only to a CGS Program for ETI. Rider CGSC would recover\n\n 8          the costs that ETI incurs to implement and administer the CGS Program,\n\n 9          which the PUCT has ruled, on an interim basis, that ETI is entitled to\n\n10           recover. There is a time value of money associated with the unrecovered\n\n11           balance of CGSC costs, due to the delay in their recovery, which is\n\n12           addressed by allowing ETI to recover interest on this unrecovered\n\n13           balance. Otherwise, ETI will not be recovering the full amount of these\n\n14           unrecovered costs.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.      ON PAGE 15 AND PRIMARILY PAGES 27 THROUGH 29, MR.\n\n17           POLLOCK        ARGUES         THAT      THE   PROVISION        ADDRESSING\n\n18           \"UNSERVED ENERGY\" SHOULD INCLUDE A PROVISION THAT\n\n19           ALLOWS A CGS CUSTOMER TO REDUCE ITS LOAD TO MATCH A\n\n20           REDUCTION IN CGS SUPPLIERS TO ETI BY THE CGS SUPPLIER. DO\n\n21           YOU AGREE?\n\n22   A.      No.    Mr. Pollock asserts a number of points in an attempt to support\n\n23           TIEC's request to include this \" reduce load to match reduced supplies\"\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 7 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           provision. I also addressed this at some length in my Supplemental Direct\n\n2           Testimony, as did Mr. Dingle. The fundamental bottom line is that TIEC's\n\n3           proposal ignores the 24/7 Unit Contingent nature of the CGS product, to\n\n4           which TIEC has agreed.\n\n 5                    In addition, as described in Mr. Dingle's Second Supplemental\n\n 6           Rebuttal Testimony, the Entergy system would purchase the CGS Supply\n\n 7          to satisfy system load. There is no direct link between the CGS Supply\n\n 8           and the CGS Customer load as implied by TIEC. TIEC attempts to make\n\n 9          this connection between CGS Supply and the CGS Customer in order to\n\n10           equate the simultaneous reduction in CGS Supply and CGS Customer\n\n11           load to the simultaneous reduction in host load and host generation\n\n12           associated with the provision of standby service to customer host\n\n13           generation.    These two situations are drastically different as I explain\n\n14           below.\n\n15                    Under Standby service for host generation, Entergy (and ETI) is not\n\n16           purchasing the host generation, rather it is satisfying host load and any\n\n17           excess in generation may or may not be \"put\" to the Company in the form\n\n18           of a QF put. The simultaneous reduction in load and generation happens\n\n19           with a singular customer at a single location, and the Company in all\n\n20           likelihood does not even know, or need to know, that this has occurred.\n\n21           On the other hand, for the CGS Program, the CGS Supplier must have\n\n22           obtained firm transmission service, committed to supply a 24/7 unit\n\n23           contingent product to the Entergy transmission grid as described by Mr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 q\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

If this CGS\n\n3           Supply is suddenly no longer available, Entergy and its other customers\n\n4           will incur a cost to 1) replace this energy source and 2) plan for and\n\n 5          provide standby service whether or not a customer's load (CGS or\n\n 6          otherwise) coincidentally is reduced.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q      ON PAGE 28, MR. POLLOCK SUGGESTS THAT THE CGS CUSTOMER\n\n 9          WILL HAVE INTERVAL DATA RECORDING METERING IN PLACE SO\n\n10           ETI   SHOULD BE ABLE TO               TELL WHEN THE CUSTOMER IS\n\n11           REDUCING LOAD IN ORDER TO MATCH THE CGS SUPPLY\n\n12           REDUCTION.          DOES THIS STATEMENT FULLY ADDRESS THE\n\n13           BILLING ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH TIEC'S PROPOSAL?\n\n14   A.      No.   This statement makes a rather broad conclusion about \"matching\"\n\n15           that does not address the events that are likely to occur in the real world\n\n16           but instead raises numerous unanswered questions. First, what is the\n\n17           Company supposed to consider for billing if the MW's do not match?\n\n18           Meaning, what if the CGS Supply was reduced by 1,500 kW between two\n\n19           30 minute intervals, but the CGS Customer's load only reduced by 1,000\n\n20           kW.    Is the Company to assume that the supply reduction and load\n\n21           reduction have \"matched\" or is the Company supposed to bill unserved\n\n22           energy for the difference between 1,500 and 1,000?\n\n\n\n\n                                                    lC)\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 9 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1                    Second, what is the Company supposed to consider for billing if the\n\n2           timing doesn't match? If the CGS supply was reduced in one interval but\n\n3           the reduction in CGS Customer load did not occur until two hours later,\n\n4           what is the Company to assume for billing unserved energy under TIEC's\n\n 5          proposal? Is the Company supposed to bill unserved energy for the\n\n 6          intervening two hours?\n\n 7                    Third, what is the Company to assume if either the supply reduction\n\n 8          or the load reduction is not constant or consistent across intervals? For\n\n 9          example, is the Company to charge for unserved energy if the load\n\n10          reduction is a constant 5,000 kW across all hours but the supply reduction\n\n11           is 5,000 kW for half of the hours but 5,100 kW for the other half of the\n\n12           hours.\n\n13                    Fourth, the CGS Program is further complicated by the potential for\n\n14           a CGS Supplier to enter into CGS agreements with multiple CGS\n\n15           Customers.      As discussed in my Supplemental Direct Testimony in the\n\n16           situation of one CGS Supplier has entered into a CGS agreement with\n\n17           multiple CGS Customers, when the CGS Supplier reduces its supply,\n\n18           there is no method for prioritizing the reduction to the multiple Customers,\n\n19           and therefore no method for determining which CGS Customer should\n\n20           avoid unserved energy charges or the level of required reduction. For\n\n21           example, if the CGS Supply was reduced by 10,000 kW and CGS\n\n22           Customer-1 reduced its load by 4,500 kW and CGS Customer-2 reduced\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 10 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          its load 3,000 kW, the Company does not know which CGS Customer(s) is\n\n 2          supposed to billed unserved energy and in what quantities.\n\n 3                  Fifth, the Company has no way to determine whether a CGS\n\n4           Customer's reduction in load truly had to do with a reduction in CGS\n\n 5          Supply or a reduction in load for economic reasons. For example, assume\n\n 6          again as in my fourth point immediately above that a single CGS Supplier\n\n 7          that has contracted with two separate CGS Suppliers. Assume the CGS\n\n 8          Customer-2 reduction in load was for economic reasons associated with\n\n 9          the sale of its own product.         Further assume that the CGS Supplier\n\n10          actually never requested CGS Customer-2 to reduce its load, but instead\n\n11          requested that CGS-Customer-1 undertake the full reduction. Under this\n\n12          set of assumptions, CGS Customer-1 should pay unserved energy for the\n\n13          full difference between 10,000 kW and 4,500 kW. From ETI's billing\n\n14           perspective, however, the Company has the exact same metering data\n\n15           under both scenarios (fourth point versus this fifth point) but has no way to\n\n16          discern that difference.\n\n17                  Finally, these issues are not mutually exclusive. For example, the\n\n18           circumstance could be similar to the fifth point above, while at the same\n\n19          time, the timing of the reductions does not match (second point above)\n\n20           and the kW values do not match (first point above).\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n                                                 t-Z^\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ON PAGE 6 OF HIS DIRECT TESTIMONY, STAFF WITNESS STEPHEN\n\n 3          J.

IS THE RECOVERY OF CGS COSTS SUBJECT TO\n\n11          TRADITIONAL TEST YEAR RATE MAKING?\n\n12   A.      No. The recovery of CGS implementation cost is subject to the specific\n\n13           provisions in PURA §39.452(b), which states in part:\n\n14                  The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be considered\n15                  to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and\n16                  [ETI's] rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff\n17                  is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of\n18                  the implementation of the tariff.\n19\n20                  A common definition of the word \" implement\" is to \"CARRY OUT,\n\n21           ACCOMPLISH; esp : to give practical effect to and ensure actual\n\n22           fulfillment by concrete measures....\"5 Substituting the definitional phrase\n\n23           into the statutory word \"implementation\" results in: \"...to recover any costs\n\n24           unrecovered as a result of giving practical effect to and ensuring actual\n\n25           fulfillment by concrete measures of the tariff.\" ETI cannot give \"practical\n\n     5 MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 582 (101h ed. 2002).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

As stated in ETI's response to OPUC RFI 2-1 and RFI 2-2, the\n\n 6          $299,372 represents the amount of CGS costs used to set current retail\n\n 7          base rates and that has been allocated to all retail rate classes.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.     WHAT IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNTS BEING BILLED\n\n10          CUSTOMERS FOR CGS IMPLEMENTATION COSTS CURRENTLY IN\n\n11          BASE RATES?\n\n12   A.     Using the residential rate class as an example, a typical residential\n\n13          customer using 1,000 kWh per month would be paying less than\n\n14          $0.03/month.6\n\n15\n\n16   Q.     ON PAGES 5 AND 8, OPUC WITNESS BENEDICT SUGGESTS THAT A\n\n17          ONCE-ANNUAL REFUND IS THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION TO CREDIT\n\n18          CUSTOMER CLASSES FOR THE AMOUNT BEING BILLED IN BASE\n\n19           RATES. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n20   A.      No. At the outset, in Docket No. 39896, the Commission authorized ETI to\n\n21           recover, through base rates, the charges to the Company's project code\n\n     6 Residential $159,946 shown on the Company's response to OPUC RFI 2-2 divided by\n        Residential 5,577,331,000 kWh (Docket No. 38986, Staff Cost of service number running\n        model, Schedule Q-7) times 1,000 kWh/month equals approximately $0.029/month.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Further, the class-based figures cited by Mr.\n\n 4          Benedict in his testimony (which were provided to OPUC through the\n\n 5          Company's response to OPUC RFI 2-2) were based on ETI's cost of\n\n 6          service model, which is an approximation of the Staff's number running\n\n 7          model. But Staff's number running model does not provide the detail or\n\n 8          functionality to segregate the CGS-related charges by customer class, and\n\n 9          a number of different allocation factors were used to allocate the CGS\n\n10          project code costs in Docket No. 39896.            Therefore, there is an\n\n11          unavoidable imprecision in those figures.\n\n12                  However, if the PUCT wants to attempt to remove customer class\n\n13          subsidies ( both inter and intra class), even given the imprecision\n\n14          described above for this portion of the Rider CGSC charge, then the\n\n15          appropriate method to address these class subsidies would be to have a\n\n16          separate rider that would essentially negate the amount included in base\n\n17          rates for CGS service, but also implement a mechanism to ensure that ETI\n\n18          then recovers this full amount via Rider CGSC. The rate for this credit\n\n19          rider would be developed by rate class using the rate class dollar amounts\n\n20          referenced in ETI's response to OPUC RFI 2-2 and included in the table\n\n21          on page 8 of Mr. Benedict's testimony divided by the billing determinants\n\n22          used to set rates in Docket No. 39896. The table below shows this credit\n\n23          rate to remove the CGS billing via base rates going forward.

IF THIS CREDIT RIDER APPROACH IS TAKEN, WHAT OTHER\n\n 7           CHANGES ARE REQUIRED?\n\n 8   A.      The Rider CGSC filed by the Company would need to have the $310,746\n\n 9           credit currently reflected in this rider removed because customers would\n\n10           effectively be receiving this credit via the credit rider.'              But as stated\n\n11           above, the Rider CGSC rate would then need to ensure that the full\n\n12           amount of implementation costs, including the $299,372, is recovered so\n\n\n\n     ' Again, ETI's Rider CGSC should have only credited the retail portion included in base rates of\n         $299,372 because that is the level reflected in current retail rates and not the full $310,746.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    iI\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          that ETI does not forego this recovery already authorized in Docket No.\n\n 2          39896.\n\n 3\n\n 4   Q.     WHY IS THE USE OF A CREDIT RIDER PREFERRED TO OPUC'S\n\n 5          PROPOSAL?\n\n 6   A.     Again, if the PUCT concludes that an attempt to remove class subsidies\n\n 7          should be made, there are a number of reasons. First, the credit rider\n\n 8          truly is the simplest approach in that this credit rider simply removes what\n\n 9          is included in base rates and it stays in effect as long as rates from Docket\n\n10          No. 39896 are in effect. Second, this approach treats all rate classes the\n\n11          same.    Third, this also simplifies Rider CGSC to just recover the CGS\n\n12          implementation and administration costs and not deal with either prior\n\n13          periods or on-going credit amounts.           Fourth, this proposal accurately\n\n14          removes any perceived customer subsidy in that the base rate charge is\n\n15          effectively removed. Fifth, this proposal not only removes any perceived\n\n16          inter-class subsidies but it also removes any intra-class subsidy. By giving\n\n17          the LIPS class a credit just like other classes and then charging the CGS\n\n18          participants the Rider CGSC costs, intra-class subsidies within the LIPS\n\n19          rate class are removed. In comparison, OPUC's proposal is overly\n\n20          complicated by once-annual refunds and continues to have an intra-class\n\n21          subsidy within the LIPS rate class.\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n                                               ^4\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

STEVEN CHRISS, FILING TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF WAL-\n\n 3          MART/SAM'S         CLUB,     RECOMMENDS THAT THE COMMISSION\n\n 4          REJECT ETI'S RIDER CGSUSC AND LIMIT THE COLLECTION OF\n\n 5          UNRECOVERED COSTS TO THE CUSTOMERS TAKING SERVICE\n\n 6          UNDER THE RIDER CGS. HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n 7   A.     First, I note that Cities filed a Motion to Strike the Rider CGSUSC\n\n 8          references and discussion in my Supplemental Direct, as well as striking\n\n 9          Rider CGSUSC attached as an exhibit to that testimony. The Company\n\n10          has filed a response in opposition to Cities' Motion to Strike. As discussed\n\n11          in the Company's response to Cities, Rider CGSUSC (and references to\n\n12          that Rider in my Supplemental Direct Testimony) should not be struck\n\n13          because that proposed Rider CGSUSC and referenced passages in\n\n14          testimony are presented to establish a complete evidentiary record on the\n\n15          issue of what are unrecovered costs, and ETI's consistent position is that\n\n16          it is a Commission policy call as to which customers are responsible for\n\n17          reimbursing ETI for its unrecovered costs.\n\n18\n\n19                                     VI.

Correct?\n 3       A      (Pollock)   The company is going to know pretty\n 4   far in advance, before the signing of the contract, that\n 5   there's a good -- at least the likelihood that there's a\n 6   resource out there, and I don't think that's going to go\n 7   totally unnoticed in the planning process.\n 8                   I mean, the company executes year,\n 9   two-year, three-year extensions of existing contracts\n10   that they might not otherwise have to do if they know\n11   that they're close to getting a CGS resource in place,\n12   within the time window, which requires that the\n13   contract, I think, has to be in place by at least April\n14   or before the summer.     So that gives the company plenty\n15   of -- and you're going to know in advance that customers\n16   are going through this process, so it's not going to be\n17   a total unknown.\n18       Q      Well, that's not my question.   My question is,\n19   the company has capacity costs that it incurs on its\n20   power plants like River Bend.\n21       A      (Pollock)   Yes.\n22       Q      And the fact that it enters into a CGS contract\n23   for a couple of years will have no tendency to reduce\n24   the capacity costs its paying for River Bend at all.\n25   Right?\n\n                  KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                          Page 181\n\n 1       A    (Pollock)     It's not intended to.   As I said,\n 2   the CGS program right now would replace a limited-term,\n 3   PPA, purchased power agreement.     So, yeah, it could\n 4   certainly def er an extension or brand new PPA from being\n 5   entered into, and that's really the point.\n 6       Q    But if the contract is for, say, three years,\n 7   and no longer than five years, it's not going to cause\n 8   the company to alter any of its obligations that are\n 9   long-term contracts.     Correct?   They would be the same?\n10       A    (Pollock)     No, but on the margins, when the\n11   company, you know, enters into numerous limited-term\n12   agreements, as they've had, it's going to affect those\n13   agreements.\n14                   I mean, you know, let's not put, you know,\n15   CGS as trying to replace a 30- or 40-year resource.         You\n16   know, maybe it eventually will do that, but for the\n17   short run, as long as the company is relying on these\n18   limited-term purchases, that's where we can defer -- and\n19   those purchases -- those costs, as Mr. May points out,\n20   keep going up, that's where we can do some good and help\n21   out the customers.\n22       Q    But it would simply be a matter, though, of\n23   what -- if you have a short-term CGS contract, what it\n24   can displace will depend on what the company has in its\n25   portfolio at the time the CGS contract is entered into.\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                                                          Page 182\n\n 1   Right?\n 2       A    (Pollock)    Sure; sure, it does.\n 3       Q    We don't know what that will be at this point?\n 4       A    (Pollock)    You know what your portfolio is.\n 5   You know for all the limited-term contracts.     You have a\n 6   start date, an end date.    The question is, is there\n 7   going to be an extension if we need it or not, and\n 8   that's where you could potentially affect the process.\n 9       Q    But we don't know when the CGS contract will be\n10   entered into?\n11       A    (Pollock)    We don't.\n12       Q    Okay.     Is it your contention or TIEC's\n13   contention that any amount of unrecovered costs, no\n14   matter how small, will undermine the program?\n15       A    (Pollock)     I think to the extent that a CGS\n16   customer is going to incur some unrecovered costs -- and\n17   that's an issue.     I can't say how much of unrecovered\n18   costs would either dissuade that customer from not\n19   entering a CGS contract or not because I'm not in a\n20   position to know that.\n21                    But I think the more pressure you put and\n22   the more hurdles you put on the program like that, I\n23   think less likely the program will work.     Maybe it will\n24   work for some customers but not as many customers as\n25   would otherwise be the case.\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                 SOAH DOCKET NO.

Yes.    The CGS-USC rider will allow the company to flow through unrecovered\n\n2         embedded cost to other customer classes.       The unrecovered costs are defined as the\n\n3         difference between the revenue paid as a CGS customer and the revenues which would\n\n4         have been collected by ETI ifthe CGS customer had remained a standard LIPS customer.\n\n5         If all LIPS customers opted for CGS service, the unrecovered costs would be $57.5\n\n6         million. 87 Furthermore, the \"lost revenue method\" used in the CGS-USC tariff may not\n\n7         be equivalent to \"unrecovered costs,\" which is the term used in the statute.\n\n 8   Q.   WHY IS \"LOST REVENUE\" DIFFERENT FROM \"UNRECOVERED COST?\"\n\n 9   A.   Revenues are intended to equal embedded cost of service for the adjusted test-year.\n\n10        However, revenues may depart from costs, either higher or lower, as the time frame\n\n11        advances further from the test-year.      Moreover, the loss of individual customers'\n\n12        revenues does not mean that the underlying costs are ''unrecovered.\" For instance, the\n\n13        generating capacity which served the departing customers can be redirected to other\n\n14        revenue producing uses, such as selling power into the wholesale market.\n\n15   Q.   CAN YOU FORESEE ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE RE-ENTRY OF\n\n16        FORMER CGS CUSTOMERS IMPOSES UNFAIR IMPACTS ON NON-\n\n17        PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS?\n\n18   A.   Yes. Bundled utility pricing tends to be more stable and less volatile than market pricing\n\n19        because rates are based upon average costs   ~stead   of marginal costs. Customers will be\n\n20        attracted to CGS service when market prices are lower than the utility's average costs.\n\n\n          87\n               May Direct Testimony at 14.\n\n\n                                                      Redacted Direct Testimony of Clarence Johnson\n                                                     On Behalf of the Office of Public Utility Counsel\n                                                SOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX; PUC Docket No. 37744\n                                                                                       Page 88 of 115\n\f                                                                                                                                                    TIEC EXHIBIT NO. 15\n\n                       PUC DOCKET NO. 38951\n\n\nAPPLICATION OF ENTERGY                                                         §\nTEXAS, INC.

UNRECOVERED COSTS FROM THE CGS PROGRAM\n\n   1\t   Q\t     WHY IS THE ISSUE OF THE DEFINITION OF \"UNRECOVERED COSTS\" BEING\n   2\t          ADDRESSED IN THIS PROCEEDING?\n   3\t   A\t     PURA § 39.452(b) provides that ETI's rates \"shall be set, in the proceeding in which\n   4\t          the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the\n   5\t          implementation of the tariff.\" ETI and TIEC do not agree about what \"costs\" this\n   6\t          refers to. Just as ETI and other utilities unsuccessfully argued with respect to energy\n   7\t          efficiency program costs, ETI claims the reference to \"costs\" would allow it to recover\n   8\t          not just its actual expenditures in implementing a CGS Program but also hypothetical\n   9\t          lost revenues ETI may have received if all CGS Customers paid ETI's full firm rate\n  10\t          instead. ETI's proposed Rider CGSUSC clearly states that it \"defines the procedure\n  11\t          by which Entergy Texas, Inc. ('Company') shall implement and adjust rates for\n  12\t          recovery of lost base rate revenue resulting from customers participating in the\n  13\t          Company's Competitive Generation Service ('CGS Program').\"' (emphasis added)\n\n  14 Definition of Unrecovered Costs\n  15\t   Q\t     HOW SHOULD UNRECOVERED COSTS BE DEFINED?\n16\t     A\t     Unrecovered costs should not include ETI's hypothetical lost revenues. If a CGS\n  17\t          tariff is adopted, the costs that could be unrecovered as a result of implementation of\n  18\t          the tariff should include the expenditures actually incurred by ETI to implement and\n\n\n\n\n        1 Docket No. 37744, ETI Ex. 9 at Exhibit PRM-1.\n\n                                                          3.

(“ETI”) submits this reply to the briefs of the Public\n\nUtility Commission of Texas (the “Commission” or “PUCT”), Texas Industrial\n\nEnergy Consumers (“TIEC”), and the Office of Public Utility Counsel (“OPUC”).\n\n                          ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.       The CGS program is the result of legislative choices that differ\n         dramatically from traditional utility regulation.\n\n         There is an unwarranted undercurrent of blame running through the\n\nCommission’s brief. Contrary to the Attorney General’s rhetoric, ETI does not\n\nseek a “free lunch,” to “avoid the reality of competition,” or to “maintain its\n\nmonopoly” by “designing an unfair program that is sure to be rejected.” Nor is\n\nETI “insinuating” or “pretending” “nonsense.”1\n\n         ETI proposed the competitive generation service (“CGS”) program because\n\nthe legislature mandated that it propose one.           See Tex. Util. Code Ann.\n\n§ 39.452(b). Moreover, this is a new program that differs in fundamental respects\n\nfrom the way utilities have operated under traditional regulation. In crafting the\n\nCGS statute, the legislature both expressly and impliedly rendered certain\n\ntraditional ratemaking principles inapplicable or unworkable. For example:\n\n         •      Utilities subject to traditional regulation are responsible for\n                procuring power for all their customers. The CGS program\n\n\n1\n    See PUCT’s Brief at 29 & 30.\n                                           1\n\f            provides a unique opportunity for some customers to contract\n            for their own power.\n\n      •     Utility rates are traditionally set based upon historical levels of\n            expense. CGS program rates must be set in the same\n            proceeding in which the program itself is created, even though\n            there are no historical CGS expenses.\n\n      •     Under traditional regulation, utilities charge rates to customers\n            that include generation, transmission, and distribution costs.\n            ETI, however, must charge an “unbundled” transmission\n            services rate to CGS customers, who are deemed not to be\n            “wholesale transmission customers.”\n\n      •     Because bundled rates are set for the future based upon\n            historical expenses, utilities generally bear the risk that costs\n            will increase before the next rate case. In the CGS statute, the\n            legislature expressly entitled ETI to recover “costs unrecovered\n            as a result of the implementation of” the program.\n\n      •     In contrast to general ratemaking principles, the legislature in\n            the CGS statute specified that some customers may not bear the\n            burden of unrecovered costs. It protected “manufacturers” who\n            choose not to participate in the program.\n\n      •     And though PURA generally limits a regulated utility’s ability\n            to offer discount rates and then burden other customers with the\n            costs the discounted customer avoids, CGS program rates “may\n            not be considered to offer a discounted rate.”\n\nThe CGS program is not business as usual.\n\nII.   The Commission has ignored part of the legislative enactment, contrary\n      to the most basic rules of statutory construction.\n\n      Over the lengthy course of the underlying contested case, the parties were\n\nnever able to agree unanimously on several issues, including the scope of ETI’s\n\nentitlement to recover costs, the extent to which the CGS program may cause ETI\n\n                                         2\n\fnot to recover costs embedded in its bundled rates, and who may fairly be required\n\nto pay for any of those unrecovered costs.2 Though appellees continue to debate\n\nthe latter two issues, they are not bases for the agency order under review. The\n\nCommission avoided those issues by defining the term “unrecovered costs” as\n\nexcluding production-related costs embedded in ETI’s bundled rates.3\n\n       The CGS statute entitles ETI “to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of\n\nthe implementation of the tariff.” Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 39.452(b). The breadth\n\nof those words, and their failure to exclude any category of costs, cannot\n\nreasonably be disputed. Nevertheless, the Commission has declared that the statute\n\nauthorizes ETI to recover only certain costs – specifically, those “of”\n\nimplementing the program. The Commission has effectively written several words\n\nout of the statute, as illustrated below:\n\n               The utility’s rates shall be set … to recover any costs\n            unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff….\n\n      This interpretation violates the paramount rule of statutory construction that\n\nstatutes must be construed according to their plain language.                 E.g., State v.\n\nShumake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894744\"><a href=\"/opinion/894744/state-v-shumake/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284 (Tex. 2006).

Moreover, when the meaning of a statute is plain from its text, rules\n\nof construction or other extrinsic aids cannot be used to create ambiguity. E.g.,\n\nHouston Mun. Employees Pension Sys. v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864 (Tex. App.\n\n– Texarkana 2006, pet. denied). The Commission may not disregard or rewrite the\n\nunambiguous mandate of the CGS statute.\n\n         A.      The Commission's order is not sustainable on an undecided\n                 factual theory.\n\n         The Attorney General and TIEC assert that the Commission instead\n\ndetermined that all of ETI’s base-rate production costs will in fact be recovered\n\nthrough the CGS program that was ultimately adopted.4 The agency said no such\n\nthing.        The Commission did not reach that question because, again, the\n\nCommission said the statute does not entitle ETI to recover that type of cost at all.\n\n         TIEC champions the factual theory anyway, presumably because it was\n\nTIEC’s principal argument to the agency. TIEC actually agreed that, “[i]f … the\n\nCommission determines that there are unrecovered costs, then Entergy is entitled\n\n\n\n\n4\n    PUCT’s Brief at 15; TIEC’s Brief at 6-10, 14, 22-23, & 35-37.\n                                                 4\n\funder the statute to recover any such costs.”5 To TIEC, the dispute should not be\n\nabout the scope of the statutory entitlement – it should be about whether ETI\n\nwould actually recover all of its costs.6\n\n       The Commission disagreed with TIEC about that. After the parties tried\n\nunsuccessfully to settle remaining issues, the Commission conducted a hearing to\n\nconsider “the remaining contested threshold issue – what types of costs will be\n\nconsidered unrecovered for purposes of PURA 39.452(b)….”7 Though the issue is\n\none of law, the parties submitted testimony on the proper interpretation of the\n\nstatute to aid the Commission in its determination.8               After the hearing, the\n\nCommission issued an interim order “making its determination of the definition of\n\nunrecovered costs.”9 The Commission said:\n\n       [T]he proper interpretation of “costs unrecovered as a result of\n       implementation of the CGS program tariff” is costs to implement and\n       administer the CGS program tariff. Such unrecovered costs do not\n       include lost revenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types\n       of costs. The Commission reverses the proposal for decision on this\n       issue.[10]\n\nIn its final order, the Commission acknowledged its interim ruling that:\n\n\n5\n   AR Part I, Binder 1, Item 22 (TIEC’s Nov. 1, 2011, List of Unsettled Issues and Request for\nProcedural Schedule at 3).\n6\n  Id. at 4 n.3.\n7\n  AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at 3 (emphasis added), 7, & FOF 20); see also AR\nPart I, Binder 1, Item 77 (Interim Order at 1 & 5).\n8\n  E.g., AR Part II, Binder 3, ETI Exh. 91 (Supp. Direct Testimony of P.

PURA § 39.452(b) does not allow for the recovery of lost\n              revenue or embedded generation costs.[13]\n\n       A review of the whole order reveals that it is TIEC, not ETI, that is\n\n“plucking” isolated words out of context.14 It is abundantly clear throughout the\n\norder that the Commission’s decision was premised not upon a factual\n\ndetermination about the extent to which ETI might not recover base-rate costs, but\n\nupon a legal conclusion about the scope of costs recoverable under the CGS\n\nstatute.15\n\n       For that reason, the order cannot be affirmed on TIEC’s factual theory. This\n\nCourt has repeatedly recognized that an agency order can be upheld on any legal\n\nbasis shown in the record, but it may not be sustained on an unarticulated factual\n\n11\n   AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 20) (emphasis added).\n12\n   Id. at 6.\n13\n   Id. at COL 2.\n14\n   See TIEC’s Brief at 36.\n15\n   AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at 6, 7-8, 11, FOFs 49-51, COL 2).\n                                               6\n\ftheory.

The Commission’s error is not harmless.\n\n         Though the Commission did not decide any factual dispute about\n\nunrecovered costs, and though the Attorney General recognizes that this case\n\npresents a legal question of statutory interpretation,16 the Attorney General now\n\nadvances a “no harm, no foul” theory. That is, the Attorney General contends that\n\nETI is not “aggrieved” by any error in the Commission’s statutory interpretation\n\nbecause ETI will in fact recover all its costs.17 The order cannot be sustained on\n\nthis basis.\n\n         The rule that only a party “aggrieved” by an agency order may challenge it\n\nis the same as the rule that only a plaintiff with a “justiciable interest” may file a\n\nlawsuit.

The\n\nCGS program was ultimately designed such that participating CGS customers\n\nwould bear the costs of the energy and capacity that they contract for under the\n\nCGS program. But the program does not, even as redesigned through negotiations,\n\nimpose upon participating customers all the costs they would have borne under the\n\nbundled rates that were set through the traditional ratemaking process.\n\n         Under the traditional regulatory scheme, ETI must arrange generation\n\nresources to serve all of its customers. ETI’s generation portfolio consists of many\n\ntypes of resources. Those include power plants owned and operated by ETI and its\n\naffiliates, short-term purchased capacity contracts, and long-term purchased\n\ncapacity contracts. ETI makes commitments and incurs costs to serve all its\n\ncustomers, including the LIPS class, not knowing which of them might ultimately\n\nmigrate to the CGS program, or for how long. The Commission determined in\n\n\n\n\n18\n     See CR 5.\n                                          8\n\fDocket No. 37744 and subsequent rate cases19 which of those costs ETI reasonably\n\nand necessarily incurred, and set base rates to recover those costs.20\n\n       When a LIPS customer migrates to the CGS program, the customer will\n\nreceive a credit for the embedded production costs the customer would have paid\n\nunder ETI’s base rates.21 The credit is some $6.50/kW/month.22 But ETI is still at\n\nrisk of having to pay these costs.\n\n       Several ETI witnesses explained that the Entergy system must continue to\n\nplan for and acquire short-, limited-, and long-term resources to reliably serve all\n\nits Texas customers, including LIPS customers who may or may not choose to\n\nparticipate in the CGS program.23 These witnesses acknowledged that the CGS\n\nprogram may help ETI avoid acquiring some capacity in the future.24 However,\n\nthe program has a limited ability to relieve ETI of its planning obligations because\n\n\n19\n    The Commission has reset ETI’s bundled rates twice since the Commission adjudicated\nDocket No. 37744.

The limited term nature of the proposed\n       agreements, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the future\n       continuation of the program, do not provide sufficient assurance that\n       CGS resources will be available to meet ETI’s long-term resource\n       needs. Furthermore, the program does not relieve ETI of its\n       obligation to serve CGS customers in the event that providers\n       withdraw or fail to renew under the program. Ultimately, the CGS\n       program is at best a limited-term alternative that could defer or\n       displace short- and limited-term PPAs [purchased power agreements],\n       but it in no way can be considered a long-term resource option or\n       affect ETI’s long-term acquisition strategy.[26]\n\nMoreover, the CGS program in no way avoids embedded capacity costs that the\n\nCompany has already incurred, especially for existing power plants and long-term\n\npurchased capacity contracts.27 Nor does the program enable ETI to recover a\n\nreturn on investments it has already made to serve customers.28\n\n       This evidence was presented after the parties proposed that CGS suppliers\n\nwould provide service that Entergy could treat as “firm” capacity.29 The Attorney\n\nGeneral ignores it.

The statute at issue in CenterPoint authorized\n                   recovery of very specific costs; the CGS statute\n                   is not so limited.\n\n      The Commission based its interpretation of the CGS statute on this Court’s\n\ndecision in CenterPoint Energy Houston Elec., LLC v. Public Util. Comm'n of\n\nTex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2544959\"><a href=\"/opinion/2544959/centerpoint-v-public-utility-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App. – Austin 2011, no pet.). As ETI explained in its\n\ninitial brief, that opinion does not concern the CGS statute. It concerns the Energy\n\nEfficiency Cost Recovery Factor (“EECRF”) statute, which by its very terms,\n\nauthorizes a utility to recover only costs made for the specific purpose of satisfying\n\nthe goal of an energy efficiency program.           See Tex. Util. Code Ann. §\n\n39.905(b)(1). The EECRF statute does not authorize the recovery of other costs,\n\nlike those that “result from” the implementation of an energy efficiency program.\n\nId. That is why this Court held that the EECRF statute does not authorize a utility\n\nto recover lost revenues that were intended to pay for something other than the\n\nutility’s costs of implementing an energy efficiency program. CenterPoint Energy\n\nHouston Elec., LLC, 354 S.W.3d at 904. Though the Court made observations\n\nabout other PURA provisions as well, it did not mention the CGS statute.\n\nMoreover, none of those observations were essential to the Court’s interpretation\n\nof the EECRF statute. Because the statute at issue in the 2011 CenterPoint case\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fand the one at issue here are materially different, appellees’ reliance upon the case\n\nis misplaced.\n\n                 2.     Here, ETI seeks to recover the very type of costs\n                        the CGS statute authorizes it to recover.\n\n         In an attempt to make this case sound like CenterPoint, or perhaps because\n\nthey recognize that the legislature clearly intended ETI to recover all the costs that\n\nwill otherwise be unrecovered as a result of implementing the program, appellees\n\nfocus their efforts on arguing that ETI is seeking something other than “costs.”\n\nThey argue that because the word “revenue” appears in the proposed CGSUSC\n\nrider, ETI is seeking to get (and presumably keep) money that it will not have to\n\npay out for any expense. That is not true. ETI has throughout this case sought to\n\nrecover the money the Commission authorized it to recover via test-year\n\nratemaking, because that was the amount of money the Commission determined is\n\nnecessary to pay ETI’s costs, and because the legislature entitled ETI to recover\n\nthat money in the CGS statute.\n\n         Appellees’ repeated suggestion that there is some significance to the way\n\nETI has characterized these amounts is without merit. It is true that ETI has\n\ncharacterized this money as both “revenues” and “costs” in this case. But that is\n\nnot to “escape” this Court’s ruling in CenterPoint.36 ETI simply recognizes the\n\nfundamental ratemaking principle that base rate costs are a utility’s revenue\n\n36\n     See PUCT’s Brief at 21.\n                                            14\n\frequirement.

Even the\n\nAttorney General acknowledges the logical link between “revenues” and “costs” in\n\ntest-year ratemaking.37\n\n          Appellees’ witnesses acknowledged that, putting semantics aside, what ETI\n\nis seeking is a measure of expenses it will not recover as a result of implementation\n\nof the program. OPUC witness Clarence Johnson testified that the costs at issue\n\nare the embedded test-year production costs upon which base rates were\n\nestablished in Docket No. 37744.38              He confirmed that fact again on cross-\n\nexamination:\n\n          Q.     And the costs that may go unrecovered due to the CGTS [CGS]\n                 program, they are reflected as part of the overall embedded\n                 costs in the test-year—right—that the rates are set on?\n\n\n\n37\n     Id. at 36.\n38\n     See Supp. AR Part II, Binder 4, OPUC Exh. 1 (Johnson Direct at 88).\n                                                15\n\f        A.    There were costs allocated to the CGS customers and to their\n              class. So in that sense, yes.39\n\nTIEC witness Jeffry Pollock agreed on cross-examination that the Company’s\n\nproposed rider would account for migrating customers’ share of the Company’s\n\nembedded fixed production costs:\n\n        Q.    And do you agree that if a LIPS customer decides to switch to\n              CGS service that ETI will not collect the fixed production cost\n              included in the LIPS rate from that customer?\n\n        A.    I think the fact that the customer has switched [to CGS] and the\n              Company is not collecting the same revenue certainly creates\n              the potential that some costs would be uncollected...—\n              unrecovered… unless there are some additional benefits to\n              offset those unrecovered costs. That’s correct.40\n\nStaff witness Stephen Mendoza confirmed on cross-examination that lost revenues\n\ncould be a measure of unrecovered costs.41 In any event, testimony on this point is\n\nimmaterial. What constitutes “costs” under the CGS statute is a question of law,\n\nand no number of witnesses testifying that costs are not really costs can make it\n\ntrue.\n\n        The Commission repeatedly suggests that ETI’s proposed rider would enable\n\nit to recover amounts not contemplated by the test-year calculation, so ETI must\n\n\n\n39\n   See Supp. AR Part IV, Vol. E (Docket No. 37744 7/20/2010 Transcript of Hearing on the\nMerits at 350-51).\n40\n   See id. at 261-62; see also Supp. AR Part IV, Vol. D (Docket No. 37744 7/16/2010 Transcript\nof Hearing on Merits at 154-57 & 161-62).\n41\n   Supp. AR Part IV, Vol. E (Docket No. 37744 7/20/2010 Transcript of Hearing on the Merits at\n356).\n                                             16\n\fnot be seeking “costs.”42 As noted above, the rider contained a true-up provision\n\nthat would ensure ETI recovered only amounts it actually paid, not hypothetical\n\ncosts. Moreover, this argument concerns the extent to which ETI may have\n\nunrecovered costs, not whether the CGS statute entitles ETI to recover them. That\n\nETI might get limited relief in a narrow, hypothetical situation (i.e., if a new LIPS\n\ncustomer joins and participates in the CGS program) does not address or excuse\n\nthe Commission’s broad error in denying ETI a mechanism for full relief.\n\n       D.     The principle of cost-causation does not justify the\n              Commission’s disregard of language in the CGS statute.\n\n       OPUC, representing residential and small business customers, argues the\n\nCommission’s order must be sustained because charging unrecovered base-rate\n\ncosts to customers who “indisputably” did not cause them (i.e., customers\n\nineligible for the CGS program) would be unfair and contravene traditional\n\nratemaking concepts embodied in PURA.43              The Commission echoes this\n\nargument.44 This is no justification for upholding the Commission’s decision.\n\n              1.      This issue is a red herring.\n\n       ETI’s challenge to the Commission’s order does not hinge on charging\n\n“unrecovered costs” to one group of customers versus another. ETI expressed\n\nopinions about which customers may be required to pay “unrecovered costs,” but\n\n42\n   PUCT’s Brief at 24 & 33.\n43\n   OPUC’s Brief at 6.\n44\n   PUCT’s Brief at 16, 33, 35, & 41.\n                                           17\n\flargely left the issue to the parties who represent the customer groups to resolve.\n\nETI did not join in or oppose the other parties’ stipulation on the subject.45\n\n       Ultimately, the Commission did not decide which customers should pay\n\nunrecovered embedded production costs because the Commission determined they\n\nare not recoverable from anyone.46 The effect of that decision is to impose the\n\ncosts on ETI. That result is what ETI disagrees with, because it violates the CGS\n\nstatute. Appellees tilt at windmills by arguing about which customers should or\n\nmust pay unrecovered costs, or whether ETI is somehow barred from taking a\n\nposition on the issue.47 The issue here is whether ETI, rather than customers, may\n\nbe forced to bear the costs.\n\n\n\n\n45\n   AR Part I, Binder 1, Item 67 (Apr. 13, 2012, Stipulation).\n46\n   Contrary to the Commission’s Statement of Facts, nowhere in the Commission’s order is there\nany hint that the agency rejected the proposed CGSUSC rider based upon principles of equity or\nany PURA provision other than the CGS statute itself. Indeed, the Attorney General does not\ncite the Commission’s order as support for that statement. Instead, the Attorney General cites\nthe ALJ’s proposal for decision. See PUCT Brief at 6. It is true that the ALJ expressed a belief\nthat it would be inequitable to shift unrecovered LIPS-class, base-rate costs to other customer\nclasses through the CGSUSC rider. Supp. AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 36 (Docket No. 37744\nProposal for Decision at 24). That belief, coupled with the ALJ’s recognition that ETI will have\nunrecovered base rate costs that the CGS statute effectively precludes assigning to LIPS\ncustomers or ETI itself, is the reason the ALJ recommended that the CGS program not be\nadopted at all. Id. The Commission, however, did not adopt that recommendation. The\nCommission expressly reversed it, concluding that the costs are not recoverable and ordering ETI\nto implement the CGS program anyway. AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at 8).\n47\n   OPUC begins its brief by arguing that ETI, by failing to oppose a stipulation among other\nparties to the case, “waived” its right to argue that customers ineligible for the CGS program\nmay be required to pay “unrecovered costs.” OPUC’s Brief at 2-3. The Commission expressly\nfound that ETI did not waive its right to appeal unsettled issues, and reserved its rights under\napplicable state and federal law. AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 55).\n                                              18\n\f               2.     Though it may not be clear which customers\n                      should pay “unrecovered costs,” it is clear that\n                      ETI may not be required to absorb them.\n\n        It is true that the CGS statute does not expressly state which customer\n\ngroups should pay ETI’s unrecovered costs.        But there can be no reasonable\n\ndisagreement that ETI gets to recover its costs from someone. And appellees\n\nignore that, to the extent there is inequity built into the CGS program, the\n\nlegislature – not ETI – has required this result. Just as the legislature had the\n\npower to enact the general prohibition on preferential rates in PURA,48 it had the\n\npower to enact an exception to that prohibition. There is no way to implement a\n\nprogram in conformity with the terms of the CGS statute without, in some manner,\n\ncreating a preferential rate or assigning costs to customers that may not cause\n\nthem.\n\n               3.     The Commission’s brief casts doubt upon\n                      whether it would be patently unfair to allocate\n                      “unrecovered costs” to ineligible customers.\n\n        OPUC argues it is unfair to allocate to customers who are ineligible for the\n\nCGS program costs that would have been paid by LIPS customers under base\n\nrates.49   The Attorney General, too, argues that it would be “absurd,” indeed\n\n“anticompetitive,” to saddle ineligible customers with these costs.50 Implicit in\n\n\n48\n   See Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 36.003.\n49\n   OPUC’s Brief at 6.\n50\n   E.g., PUCT’s Brief at 16, 35, & 39.\n                                         19\n\fthese arguments is the assumption that LIPS customers, not others, caused these\n\ncosts.\n\n          It is strange, then, that the Attorney General elsewhere questions whether\n\nbase rate costs allocated to LIPS customers in traditional rate cases were actually\n\ncaused by LIPS customers. The Attorney General notes that test-year expenses are\n\nallocated to customer classes based on several factors, only one of which is the\n\nprinciple of “cost causation.”51\n\n          First, regardless of whether the costs were “caused” by LIPS customers, the\n\ncosts were nevertheless allocated to LIPS customers in ETI’s rate cases. They are\n\nthe costs LIPS customers avoid by migrating to the program52 and, therefore, the\n\ncosts ETI is at risk of not recovering. ETI is entitled to recover them under the\n\nCGS statute.\n\n          Second, the Attorney General’s insistence that LIPS customers do not\n\nnecessarily cause these costs defeats its own argument that it is unfair to charge\n\nthem to other customers. If the costs at issue were not necessarily caused by the\n\nLIPS class, then how can the Attorney General logically argue it violates the\n\nprinciple of cost causation to assign them to other customer classes? That makes\n\nno sense. Someone caused the costs, because the Commission has determined in\n\nrate cases that ETI reasonably and necessarily incurred them to serve customers.\n\n51\n     Id. at 36-38.\n52\n     AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 41(C)(2)-(4)).\n                                                 20\n\f             4.    If the statute inescapably dictates an\n                   unpalatably unfair result, the solution was to\n                   decline to adopt the program.\n\n      If the CGS program cannot fairly be implemented with full adherence to\n\nstatutory parameters, then the Commission could and should have declined to\n\nadopt a CGS program. PURA expressly authorizes the Commission to take that\n\nroute. Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 39.452(b). The Commission may not instead ignore\n\nthe language of the statute to create a program that it perceives to be better (but\n\ndetrimental to ETI). The legislature clearly said ETI gets to recover its costs, and\n\nthe Commission cannot ignore that mandate simply because it believes the\n\nmandate was “absurd” or difficult to comply with.\n\n      E.     Other traditional ratemaking principles do not trump the\n             plain language of the CGS statute.\n\n             1.    The CGS statute is an exception to the\n                   traditional regulatory scheme.\n\n      OPUC ignores that the legislature, in enacting the CGS statute, created an\n\nexception to the traditional regulatory scheme. A specific statutory provision\n\nprevails as an exception over a conflicting general provision. E.g., Jackson v. State\n\nOffice of Administrative Hearings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540526\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540526/jackson-v-state-office-of-admin-hearings/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297 (Tex. 2011). Moreover,\n\n“if statutes are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date of enactment prevails.”\n\nJackson, 351 S.W.3d at 297. The CGS statute is irreconcilable with traditional\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fratemaking principles in several respects. Because it is more specific and more\n\nrecently enacted, it controls in these respects.\n\n         OPUC argues that a statutory exception to a general rule must be “strictly”\n\nor “narrowly” construed.53        Courts have construed certain statutory “exceptions”\n\nnarrowly, but only when the language of those statutes – or some other legal\n\nprovision – has required it. Again, the principle rule of statutory construction is to\n\ngive effect to the legislature’s expression of its intent through the words it enacted.\n\nNo rule of statutory construction is paramount to that one.\n\n                2.        PURA 11.002 does not shed any light on the\n                          proper interpretation of the CGS statute.\n\n         OPUC nevertheless argues that PURA section 11.002, assuring rates that are\n\nreasonable to both customers and utilities, supports the Commission’s decision.54\n\nSee Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 11.002(a). OPUC ignores that the outcome here is not\n\nfair to the utility, which is mandated to propose this program and statutorily\n\nentitled to recover costs unrecovered as a result of it. PURA section 11.002\n\nweighs against the Commission’s decision as much as it supports it.\n\n\n\n\n53\n     OPUC’s Brief at 7.\n54\n     Id.\n                                            22\n\f               3.     The concept of “regulatory lag” does not\n                      absolve the Commission of its duty to follow the\n                      plain language of the statute.\n\n       OPUC says the “harm” from the Commission’s decision can be ameliorated\n\nin ETI’s next rate case.55 This statement ignores not only the effects of regulatory\n\nlag, but also the language in the CGS statute requiring that CGS rates be set “in the\n\nproceeding in which the [CGS] tariff is adopted.” See Tex. Util. Code Ann.\n\n§ 39.452(b).\n\n       OPUC begrudgingly acknowledges this problem, and says ETI could have\n\navoided it by requesting an adjustment to test-year billing determinants in its last\n\nrate case.56 But as the Commission found and no one disputes, it is not possible to\n\nknow the full effects of the CGS program until customers sign up and start taking\n\nservice.57\n\n       OPUC ultimately argues that it is perfectly reasonable to saddle ETI with\n\nlosses that occur during the regulatory lag period, because that is a known risk\n\nborne by utilities subject to traditional ratemaking.58 But again, the legislature in\n\nthe CGS statute crafted an exception to traditional ratemaking, and entitled ETI to\n\nits otherwise unrecovered costs.            This entitlement to full cost recovery is\n\nnecessarily an exception to the risk of regulatory lag.\n\n55\n   Id. at 13.\n56\n   Id. at 14.\n57\n   AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOF 57(E)).\n58\n   OPUC’s Brief at 15 & 18.\n                                              23\n\f          This statutory entitlement is also why the High Plains case is especially\n\nrelevant. That case confirms that a ratemaking agency must give a utility an\n\nopportunity to recover 100% of its reasonably incurred costs. Railroad Comm’n of\n\nTex. v. High Plains Natural Gas Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368137\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368137/rr-comn-of-tex-v-high-plains-nat-gas/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1981). In the same\n\nway the Railroad Commission did in High Plains, the Commission here has\n\neliminated the opportunity to recover a portion of the reasonable and necessary\n\ncosts the utility will incur. OPUC and the Commission point out that PURA\n\ncontains a prohibition on the use of some automatic adjustment clauses, while the\n\nGas Utility Regulatory Act (“GURA”) administered by the Railroad Commission\n\ndoes not.59 See Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 36.201. That fact is irrelevant because it\n\nwas not a basis of the Court’s decision in High Plains. The decision was based\n\nupon a GURA section that has a materially identical counterpart in PURA section\n\n36.051. See High Plains, 628 S.W.2d at 753. Both provisions require the agencies\n\nto afford utilities a reasonable opportunity to recover their costs. The Commission\n\ndid not do that here.\n\n                 4.      The reference to discount rates in the CGS\n                         statute supports ETI’s argument.\n\n          OPUC and the Commission contend the legislature’s reference to PURA\n\nsection 36.007 in the CGS statute does not support ETI’s argument. First, ETI’s\n\nargument is based upon the legislature’s mandate that ETI recover its unrecovered\n\n59\n     Id. at 26; PUCT’s Brief at 43.\n                                          24\n\fcosts. The reference to section 36.007 simply supports that mandate, by allowing\n\ncosts avoided by CGS customers to be allocated to other customers. See Tex. Util.\n\nCode Ann. § 36.007(d).\n\n      Second, appellees stretch to come up with another meaning for the reference.\n\nThey contend it harks to other aspects of PURA section 36.007, which contemplate\n\nthat discounted rates may not be less than a utility’s marginal costs. They contend\n\nthe legislature, by referring to section 36.007, simply meant that CGS rates can be\n\nless than a utility’s marginal costs, to enable CGS customers to negotiate their own\n\ndeals. Either way, OPUC and the Commission argue, ETI may be forced to absorb\n\nthe costs it incurs to serve customers that migrate to the CGS program.\n\n      These musings are not supported by the language of the CGS statute. It does\n\nnot refer to one particular aspect of PURA section 36.007. It renders the whole of\n\nsection 36.007 inapplicable, and in the same sentence says ETI gets to recover any\n\nunrecovered costs. The whole sentence reads:\n\n      The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be considered to offer a\n      discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and the utility’s rates\n      shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover\n      any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\nId. § 39.452(b). The legislature obviously meant to remove the CGS program from\n\nall the limitations of the discount rate statute, including the prohibition on\n\nrecovering discounts from other customers.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\fIII.   The Commission’s decision not to allow ETI to recover all of its costs of\n       implementing the CGS tariff is reversible because it, too, contradicts the\n       plain language of the statute.\n\n       The Commission and TIEC contend that the CGS statute does not authorize\n\nETI to recover the costs of developing the CGS program because they are just a\n\n“cost of doing business.”60      But development of a CGS program is not a cost of\n\ndoing business under traditional rate regulation. The legislature mandated ETI to\n\ndesign this program, and authorized ETI to recover all the costs that result from\n\nimplementing it.\n\n       Appellees also argue that adopting a rider that allows ETI to recover costs\n\nincurred before the program goes live would enable ETI to over-recover the costs,\n\nbecause some early costs were included in base rates.61 But ETI recognized this\n\nissue and proposed to credit any of these costs that were included in base rates, so\n\nthe costs will not be recovered twice.62\n\n       The Commission says it refused to do that because it would constitute\n\nimproper retroactive ratemaking.63          The rule against retroactive ratemaking\n\nprohibits a utility commission from making a retrospective inquiry to determine\n\nwhether a prior rate was reasonable and imposing a surcharge when rates were too\n\nlow or a refund when rates were too high.

App. – Austin 2011, pet. denied). ETI’s request, which it\n\nmade when it first proposed the CGS program in Docket No. 37744, and before the\n\ncosts at issue were even incurred, does not implicate a “prior rate.”           The\n\nCommission itself has recognized – and this Court has affirmed – that authorizing\n\nrecovery of costs in an analogous circumstance does not constitute retroactive\n\nratemaking. Office of Public Util. Counsel, 344 S.W.3d at 454. Indeed, the tariff\n\nadopted in this case contemplates a future recovery of past expenses, as it\n\nauthorizes ETI to accrue implementation costs but wait 6 months to file the CGSC\n\nrider.64 This is no basis upon which to sustain the Commission’s misapplication of\n\nthe CGS statute.\n\nIV.       The Commission’s decision not to allow ETI to recover interest on its\n          unrecovered costs is reversible because the CGS statute entitles ETI to\n          all of its unrecovered costs.\n\n          Because the CGS statute entitles ETI to recover all of its costs that are\n\nunrecovered as a result of implementation of the CGS program, ETI is entitled to\n\nrecover interest on the balance of those costs until they are recovered.        The\n\nCommission offers several purported justifications for denying ETI that interest.\n\n\n64\n     AR Part I, Binder 2, Item 119 (Final Order at FOFs 54(A), 57(A) & (E)).\n                                                27\n\f         First, the Commission says the unrecovered balance is “relatively small” and\n\nwill be recouped “quickly” so should be treated consistently with rate case\n\nexpenses, upon which the Commission has not historically allowed interest to\n\naccrue.65       The Commission’s historical treatment of rate case expenses is not\n\npersuasive in this context. The Commission may award rate case expenses. See\n\nTex. Util. Code Ann. § 36.061(b).         But the CGS statute does not give the\n\nCommission any discretion not to allow ETI’s unrecovered costs. And the statute\n\ndoes not say ETI may recover only its “sizable” or “significant” costs – it says\n\n“any” of its costs. Id. § 39.452(b).\n\n         Second, the Commission argues that ETI is not entitled to earn interest on\n\nunrecovered expenses under the traditional ratemaking construct.66 As explained\n\nabove, the CGS statute is a marked departure from that construct. In traditional\n\nratemaking, a utility bears some risk that its rates will not cover its actual expenses.\n\nThe CGS statute, in contrast, says ETI gets to recover costs that are unrecovered as\n\na result of the implementation of the CGS program.\n\n         When PURA entitles a utility to recover its costs dollar for dollar, PURA\n\nimpliedly requires the Commission to award interest on those costs until they are\n\nrecovered. CenterPoint Energy, Inc. v. Public Util. Comm’n of Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894605\"><a href=\"/opinion/894605/centerpoint-energy-inc-v-public-util-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (Tex. 2004). The Commission misstates the basis of the Texas Supreme\n\n65\n     PUCT’s Brief at 48.\n66\n     Id. at 49.\n                                          28\n\fCourt’s holding in CenterPoint Energy, Inc. The Court reversed the Commission’s\n\nrefusal to allow utilities to accrue interest on stranded cost balances for the whole\n\ntime they were on the books. The Court expressly said that was error because\n\nrequiring a utility to wait two or three years before interest began would contradict\n\nthe utility’s statutory entitlement to recover of all its stranded costs. Id. at 84. The\n\nCourt so held even though PURA did not expressly authorize utilities to earn\n\ninterest on their unrecovered stranded costs.\n\n      The same is true here. The CGS statute does not expressly authorize ETI to\n\naccrue interest on its unrecovered cost balance. But because the statute entitles\n\nETI to all of its unrecovered costs, ETI will not be made whole unless it is able to\n\naccrue interest while the balances are unrecovered.\n\n                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      For all these reasons, Entergy Texas, Inc. respectfully requests that the Court\n\nreverse the district court’s judgment insofar as it upholds the Commission’s\n\ndecision in the respects discussed above. ETI requests that this Court remand the\n\ncase to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with the Court’s\n\ndecision. Finally, ETI requests its costs of court and any other relief to which it\n\nmay show itself justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                               DUGGINS WREN MANN & ROMERO, LLP\n\n\n                               By:     /s/ Marnie A.

Findings of Fact\n\n Procedural Histo\n 1.     On December 30, 2009, ETI filed an application requesting approval of (1) base rate\n        tariffs and riders designed to collect an overall revenue requirement of $1,758.4 million,\n        which includes a total non-fuel retail revenue requirement of $838.3 million (base rate\n        revenues of $486 million plus revenue from riders of $352.3 million); (2) a set of\n        proposed tariff schedules presented in the Electric Utility Rate Filing Package for\n        Generating Utilities (RFP) accompanying ETI's application; (3) a request for final\n        reconciliation of ETI's fuel and purchased power costs for the reconciliation period from\n        April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009; and (4) certain waivers to the instructions in RFP\n        Schedule V accompanying ETI's application.\n\n2.      The 12-month test year employed in ETI's filing ended on June 30, 2009.\n\n3.      ETI provided notice by publication for four consecutive weeks before the effective date\n\n        of the proposed rate change in newspapers having general circulation in each county of\n\n        ETI's Texas service territory. ETI also mailed notice of its proposed rate change to all of\n       its customers. Additionally, ETI timely served notice of its statement of intent to change\n\n       rates on all municipalities retaining original jurisdiction over its rates and services. ETI\n\n       also published one-time supplemental notice by publication in newspapers and by bill\n       insert.\n\n4.     The following parties were granted intervenor status in this docket:        OPUC, Cities,\n       Cottonwood, Kroger, State Agencies, TIEC, and Wal-Mart.

The signatories stipulated that the Company's depreciation rates for non-River Bend\n        production plant, transmission, distribution, and general plant will remain at current\n        levels and the Company will maintain its accounting records on a prospective basis for\n        purposes of depreciation accrual, depreciation reserve, retirements, additions, salvage,\n\n        and cost of removal by FERC account.\n\n Consistency of the AQreement with PURA and the Commission Requirements\n\n 34.    Considered in light of (1) the pre-filed testimony by the parties entered into evidence and\n        (2) the additional evidence and testimony admitted during the course of the hearing on\n        the merits on the Company's application, the stipulation is the result of compromise from\n        each signatory, and these efforts, as well as the overall result of the stipulation viewed in\n        light of the record evidence as a whole, support the reasonableness and benefits of the\n\n        terms of the stipulation.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                            Order                                     Page 11 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n35.    The evidence addressed in finding of fact 34 demonstrates that the rates, terms, and\n       conditions resulting from the stipulation are just and reasonable and consistent with the\n       public interest.\n\n36.    The total level of the Texas retail revenue requirement contemplated by the stipulation\n       will allow ETI the opportunity to earn a reasonable return over and above its reasonable\n       and necessary operating expense.\n\n37.    The stipulated revenue requirement is consistent with applicable provisions of PURA\n       chapter 36 and the Commission's rules.\n\n38.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n       fuel expense, they are reasonable and necessary for each class of affiliate costs presented\n       in ETI's application.\n\n39.    To the extent that affiliate costs are included in the stipulated revenue requirement and\n       fuel expense, the price charged to ETI is not higher than the prices charged by the\n       supplying affiliate for the same item or class of items to its other affiliates or divisions, or\n       a non-affiliated person within the same market area or having the same market\n       conditions.\n\n40.    The retail revenue requirement in the stipulation does not include any expenses\n       prohibited from recovery under PURA.\n\n41.    A return on equity of 10.125% and a weighted average cost of capital of 8.5209% for ETI\n       should be adopted consistent with the stipulation.\n\n42.    The agreed rate-design provisions and terms and conditions of service included in the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n43.    The treatment of rate-case expenses described in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n44.    The Company's proposed remote-communications-link rider as filed by the Company\n       is reasonable.\n\n45.    The depreciation rates agreed to in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                            Order                                 Page 12 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n46.    The recovery of $2,019,000 annually for decommissioning costs of nuclear production\n       assets based on the factors agreed to in the stipulation is reasonable.\n\n47.    A $3.65 million annual storm cost accrual is reasonable.\n\n48.    The class allocation methodologies described in the stipulation are just and reasonable.\n\n49.    The fuel and IPCR-related provisions of the stipulation are reasonable.\n\n\n\n                                    H.     Conclusions of Law\n1.     ETI is a public utility as that term is defined in PURA § 11.004(1) and an electric utility\n       as that term is defined in PURA § 31.002(6).\n\n2.     The Commission exercises regulatory authority over ETI and jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter of this application pursuant to PURA §§ 14.001, 32.001, 32.101, 33.002, 33.051,\n        36.001-.111, 36.203, 39.452, and 39.455.\n\n3.      SOAH has jurisdiction over matters related to the conduct of the hearing and the\n       preparation of a proposal for decision in this docket, pursuant to PURA § 14.053 and\n        TEx. Gov'T CODE ANN. § 2003.049.\n\n4.      This docket was processed in accordance with the requirements of PURA, the Texas\n        Administrative Procedure Act,g and Commission rules.\n\n5.      ETI provided notice of its application in compliance with PURA § 36.103, P.U.C. PROC.\n        R. 22.51(a), and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.235(b)(1)-(3).\n\n6.      This docket contains no remaining contested issues of fact or law.\n\n7.      The stipulation, taken as a whole, is a just and reasonable resolution of all issues it\n        addresses; results in just and reasonable rates, terms, and conditions; is supported by a\n        preponderance of the credible evidence in the record; is consistent with the relevant\n        provisions of PURA; and is consistent with the public interest.\n\n 8.     ETI has properly accounted for the amount of fuel and IPCR-related revenues collected\n        pursuant to the fuel factor and Rider IPCR.\n\n\n        8 TEX. Gov'T CODE ANN. Chapter 2001 (Vernon 2007 and Supp. 2009).\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                           Order                                   Page 13 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n9.     The revenue requirement, cost allocation, revenue distribution, and rate design\n       implementing the stipulation result in rates that are just and reasonable, comply with the\n       ratemaking provisions in PURA, and are not unreasonably discriminatory, preferential, or\n       prejudicial.\n\n10.    Based on the evidence in this docket, the overall total invested capital through the end of\n       the test year meets the requirement in PURA § 36.053(a) that electric utility rates be\n       based on the original cost, less depreciation, of property used by and useful to the utility\n       in providing service.\n\n11.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that it is entitled to the level of retail\n       base rate and rider revenue set out in the stipulation.\n\n12.    ETI has met its burden of proof in demonstrating that the rates resulting from the\n       stipulation are just and reasonable, and consistent with PURA.\n\n\n\n                                 III.    Ordering Paragraphs\n1.     ETI's application seeking authority to change its rates; reconcile its fuel and purchased\n       power costs for the Reconciliation Period from April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009; and for\n       other related relief is approved consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n       of law.\n\n2.     Rates, terms, and conditions consistent with the stipulation are approved.\n\n3.     The tariffs and riders consistent with the stipulation are approved for the initial and\n       second step rate increases.\n\n4.     ETI's request for waivers of RFP instructions (RFP Schedule V) is granted.\n\n5.     ETI shall adjust decommissioning expense related to the River Bend Nuclear Generating\n       Station consistent with the terms of this Order.\n\n6.     Neither the stipulation and settlement agreement nor this Order constitutes the\n       Commission's agreement with, or consent to, the manner in which ETI, or any entity\n       affiliated with ETI, has interacted with any decommissioning trust to which ETI or its\n       ratepayers have made contributions or provided funds. Furthermore, this Order in no\n\f                                              Order                                     Page 14 of 15\nPUC Docket No. 37744\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n       way constitutes a waiver or release of any conduct, whether or not such conduct occurred\n       before the date of this Order, that may constitute a violation of any provision of state law,\n       including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of this Commission relating to\n       nuclear decommissioning trust funds; or prevents the Staff of the Commission from\n       opening an investigation and taking enforcement action relating to violations of such\n\n       rules and regulations.\n\n7.     Nothing contained in this Order constitutes the consent or approval, explicit or implied,\n        of any modification, amendment or clarification of any power purchase agreement\n        between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station.        Without\n\n        limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Order shall constitute the consent or\n        approval of any modification, amendment, or clarification of any power purchase\n        agreement between ETI and any other Entergy entity relating to the River Bend Station,\n        which is made to address any concerns raised by the NRC in its Request for Additional\n        Information regarding the River Bend Station dated March 11, 2010.\n\n 8.     The Rider IPCR costs and eligible fuel costs requested by ETI are, consistent with this\n        Order, reconciled through June 30, 2009, and are approved consistent with the\n\n        stipulation.\n\n 9.     ETI shall adjust its fuel over/under recovery balance consistent with the findings in this\n\n        Order.\n\n 10.    ETI shall file an RPCEA Rider consistent with the above findings of fact and conclusions\n        of law to be effective with the first billing cycle of the billing month immediately\n        following the effective date of this Order..\n\n 11.    Because the final approved rates are equal to or higher than the interim rates adopted in\n        Order No. 3, no refund of the interim rates authorized by Order No. 3 is necessary.\n\n 12.    The interim rates approved in Order No. 12 are herby approved for the initial step rate\n         increase contemplated by the stipulation, and ETI shall implement the second step rates\n         for bills rendered on and after May 2, 2011, the first billing cycle for the revenue month\n\n         of May.\n\fPUC Docket No. 37744                                Order                                 Page 15 of 15\nSOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX\n\n\n\n13.       Within 30 days of the date of this Order, ETI shall file a clean copy of all of the tariffs\n          and schedules approved in this docket and a clean copy of the attachments to the\n          stipulation.\n\n14.       The entry of this Order consistent with the stipulation does not indicate the Commission's\n          endorsement of any principle or method that may underlie the stipulation. Neither should\n          entry of this Order be regarded as a precedent as to the appropriateness of any principle\n          or methodology underlying the stipulation.\n\n15.       All other motions, requests for entry of specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\n          ordering paragraphs, and any other requests for general or specific relief, if not expressly\n          granted in this order, are hereby denied.\n\n\n\n          SIGNED AT AUSTIN, TEXAS the ^C> I day of December 2010\n\n\n\n                                          PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n\n\n\n\n                                           d                ^\n                                          BA     .

INTRODUCTION\n\n\n       On December 30, 2009, Entergy Texas, Inc. (ETl or Company) filed its application for\nauthority to change rates and reconcile fuel costs (Application). On July 13, 2010, the parties\nappeared for the hearing on the merits. At the beginning of the hearing, the parties informed the\nAdministrative Law Judges (ALJs) that they were engaged in settlement negotiations.                         On\nJuly 15, 2010, the parties advised the ALJs that there was a settlement in principle on all issues\nin the case except for ETl's Competitive Generation Service (CGS) proposal. Concurrent with\nthis Proposal for Decision (PFD) the AU is forwarding to the Commission the parties'\nStipulation and Settlement Agreement and Proposed Final Order filed on August 6, 2010. The\nALJ recommends that the Commission reject ETl's CGS proposal. However, the Commission\nmay disagree. As a result, the ALJ provides a full discussion of the parties' arguments.\n\n\n                                      II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n       On July 16 and July 20, 2010, the parties attended a limited hearing on the merits for\nissues solely related to CGS. 1 ALJ Travis Vickery presided and drafted this PFD. The following\nparties attended the hearing on the merits and submitted post-hearing briefing: ETl, Staff of the\nPublic Utility Commission of Texas (PUC or Commission), Office of Public Utility Counsel of\nTexas (OPUC), State of Texas' Agencies and Institutions of Higher Education (State),\nCottonwood Energy Company, L.P. (Cottonwood), and Texas Industrial Energy Consumers\n\n\n\n\n       I   In the interests ofjudicial economy, the AU has borrowed liberally from the parties' briefing.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

SUMMARY\n\n\n         All parties that participated in the hearing, except TIEC and Cottonwood, oppose ETI's\nCGS proposal, including Staff (referred to generally as opponents). In general, the opponents\nargue that the Company's proposed CGS tariff runs contrary to legislative intent and sound\neconomic and public policy. These parties, however, also make arguments in the alternative.\nCottonwood argues only that independent power producers (IPPs) be included as eligible\nsuppliers. TIEC argues that the program should be approved with certain modifications.\n\n\n         Although the ALJ offers a discussion of the major Issues raised by the parties, he\nrecommends rejection ofETI's CGS proposal. ETI, as a regulated member ofa multi-state set of\nrelated utilities, is limited in its ability to propose a CGS program that offers somewhat\ncompetitive choice to a limited class of customers. The ALJ finds that ETI's CGS proposal\nreflects a good faith attempt to navigate the conflicting interplay of its status within the Entergy\nsystem, principles of traditional ratemaking, and the competitive goals of the CGS legislation.\nThe ALJ's primary reasons for recommending rejection of the proposal echoes the opponents'\narguments: the anticipated costs are not ascertainable until the program has been implemented;\nand these potentially substantial costs are shifted to parties who may chose not to, or are not\neligible to, participate in the program.\n\n\n         Although ETI is a necessary third party to any transaction between a CGS supplier and\ncustomer, it has attempted to render itself neutral by adopting a pass-through rate for supplier\nand customer. The fundamental problem is, for every customer that migrates to the program,\nETI loses a customer that contributes to the recovery of its embedded production costs. As\n\n       2 The following parties intervened or participated in this docket: Staff, OPUC, the State, Cities,\nCottonwood, TIEC, Kroger Co., and Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and Sam's East, Inc. (Wal-Mart).\n        3 Although a number of parties proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the ALJ adopted\nStaffs with limited modifications.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                       PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                            PAGE 3\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\nexplained below, the CGS legislation makes clear ETl is not to bear any costs as a result of the\nimplementation of the program. As a result, ETl's proposal shifts the bulk of these unrecovered\ncosts to all non-participating customers. This cost-shifting violates the basic principal of cost-\ncausation. Although the parties offered some discussion of legislative intent, the ALJ is not\nconvinced that this cost-shifting was intended by the Legislature. It is clear, however, that the\ndrafters sought to create a program that offers competitive choice to certain ETl customers.\nAlthough the ALJ recommends rejection, he also understands the Commission may find, as a\nmatter of policy, that the Legislature's intent to develop a competitive set of suppliers overrides\nthe principal of cost-causation.\n\n\n                                         IV. BACKGROUND\n\nA.          The CGS Legislation\n\n\n            The Company's proposed CGS program in this proceeding is the product of legislation\nfirst enacted in 2005 as House Bill 1567. 4 The bill addressed a number of issues related to the\ntiming of rate cases and cost recovery during Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s (EGSI) efforts to\ntransition to retail open access. The legislation authorized EGSI to file a rate proceeding with an\neffective date no earlier than June 30, 2008, and stipulated that as a part of that rate proceeding:\n\n        [t]he utility shall propose a competitive generation tariff to allow eligible\n        customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The commission\n        shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff The tariffs subject to this\n        subsection may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section\n        36.007, and the utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is\n        adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the\n        tariffS\n\n\n\n\n       4 Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UIIL. CODE ANN., §§ 39.451 - 39.463 (Vernon 1998 & Supp. 2005)\n(PURA 2005).\n        5   PURA 2005 at § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                           PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                             PAGE 4\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n         To comply with HB 1567, EGSI submitted a CGS proposal as part of its application in\nDocket No. 34800. 6            In that proposal, CGS customers were to be treated as wholesale\ntransmission customers so they could seek competitive wholesale generation supply on the same\ntenns as other wholesale market participants. The Commission approved a settlement of that\nproceeding whereby the Company's CGS proposal was severed into a separate proceeding, 7\nDocket No. 36713. 8\n\n\n         Soon after the resolution of Docket No. 34800 and initiation of Docket No. 36713, the\nTexas Legislature enacted House Bill 1492, which, among other things, altered the Company's\nobligations with regard to the transition to retail open access and significantly amended the\nprovisions of PURA § 39.452(b) that addressed the requirements of a proposed competitive\ngeneration tariff, which now reads:\n\n\n         An electric utility subject to this subchapter shall propose a competItIve\n         generation tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive\n         generation. The commission shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff\n         not later than September 1,2010. The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be\n         considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and the\n         utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to\n         recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff. The\n         commission shall ensure that a competitive generation tariff shall not be\n         implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of\n         manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.\n         Pursuant to the competitive generation tariff, an electric utility subject to this\n         subsection shall purchase competitive generation service, selected by the\n         customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer. An electric utility\n         subject to this subsection shall provide and price retail transmission service,\n         including necessary ancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take\n         advantage of the competitive generation tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the\n         utility's cost of service. Such customers shall not be considered wholesale\n         transmission customers. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the\n         commission may not issue a decision relating to a competitive generation tariff\n\n\n        6 Application of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, Docket\nNo. 34800 (Mar. 16,2009).\n         7   Id., Final Order at FoF 32, Ordering Paragraph No.5.\n         8 Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Approval of Competitive Generation Services Tariff, Docket\nNo. 36713 (pending).

The Company's CGS Proposal\n\n       Pursuant to PURA § 39.452, ETl proposed a CGS tariff as part of its Application. The\nCompany's CGS proposal consists of a CGS Tariff, a CGS Cost Rider (CGSC) and a CGS\nUnrecovered Service Cost Rider (CGSUSC). In its initial brief, ETl provided a diagram to\nillustrate the mechanics of the tariff and how costs are handled under the Company's proposed\n\n\n       9   PURA § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

For the benefit of the Commission, the diagram is attached to the PFD as\nAttachment A.\n\n\n        1.         The CGS Tariff\n\n\n        ETl's proposed COS tariff provides eligible customers with the opportunity to have ETl\npurchase competitive generation selected by the COS customer and provide the selected\ngeneration at retail to the COS customer. Under the proposal, the eligible customers are Large\nIndustrial Power Service (LIPS) and LIPS Time-of-Day rate schedule customers.                         A   cas\ncustomer would have the ability to contract with a participating COS supplier (an eligible QF\nlocated in ETl's service territory) that puts energy to ETl for a set amount of load at an agreed\nupon price. The      cas customer must designate what portion of its load will be served by its cas\nsupplier under the COS tariff and what portion will be served under the applicable LIPS tariff\nrate.\n\n\n        So long as the COS supplier provides the energy contracted by the                cas buyer, ETI will\ncontinue to purchase energy from the QF at the avoided cost rate and the COS customer will pay\nETl the avoided cost rate for the level contracted for in place of all generation related\ncomponents that would otherwise be billed under the LIPS tariff. A                  cas customer and a QF\nsupplier are free to contract, without ETl's participation, for a price other than avoided cost, in\nwhich case, the costs above or below the avoided costs would be accounted for in payments\nbetween the COS customer and COS supplier, or vice versa, as prescribed by the contract. 10\n\n\n        ETl explains that the COS customer could avoid costs it would otherwise incur under the\nCompany's fixed fuel factor, along with the portion of the Company's retail rates that represent\nembedded production costs. Transmission service associated with the delivery of power would\nbe provided at an unbundled retail rate. In the event the QF with whom the COS customer has\ncontracted fails to deliver the contracted-for power, the Company would provide service at an\n\"Unserved Energy\" rate. The initial period of implementation would be one-year, beginning in\nJanuary 2011, followed by a Company report to the Commission.                       ETl anticipates possible\n\n        10   ETI Ex. 3 at ETI Rate Schedule LQF; ETI Ex. 9 at 9-10, Ex. PRM-l; ETI Ex. 52 at 34-36.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

The CGSC Rider\n\n\n       The CGSC rider is designed to recover costs related to the start-up and ongomg\noperations incurred to implement the CGS. Costs will be based on estimates and ETI proposes\nthey be trued-up on an annual basis to match what the Company has actually incurred as a result\nof the program. As proposed, the costs would be recovered from all CGS eligible customers\n                                                                                                    12\n(LIPS) through Rider CGSC regardless of whether they actually take the CGS service.\n\n\n       3.          The CGSUSC Rider\n\n\n        ETI proposes the CGSUSC rider to recover avoided embedded generation costs that\nwould have been allocated to LIPS customers under ETI's retail base rates, had those customers\nnot elected to participate in CGS. Rider CGSUSC is designed to recover the difference between\nwhat would have been billed by ETI under traditional LIPS service and what is billed under the\ncombined CGS tariff and modified LIPS service. Rider CGSUSC would recover embedded\ngeneration costs and ',Uly other related base rate costs and would apply to all non-participating\ncustomers across all classes, including LIPS customers not participating in the CGS program,\nthrough a rider that will be trued-up against the actual avoided embedded generation costs and\nreset on an annual basis. 13\n\n\n        4.         The System Agreement\n\n\n       ETI developed its CGS proposal under constraints associated with its relation to the\nEntergy System (System), the Entergy Operating Committee, and the Entergy System\nAgreement (System Agreement). The System Agreement is a PERC-approved tariff governing\n\n        II   PURA § 39.452(b); ETI Ex. 52 at 37; ETI Ex. 9 at 15,22-24, Ex.

The Entergy Operating\nCommittee is the entity charged by the FERC with administering the Entergy System\nAgreement.        The System Agreement vests the Operating Committee with the discretion to\nallocate QF put energy among the Operating Companies.                       The Operating Committee has\n                              ,\nexercised that discretion and determined that QF put should be allocated to the host Operating\nCompany. 14\n\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that matters delegated to the Entergy Operating Committee\nas part of its duty to administer the System Agreement are matters of exclusive FERC\njurisdiction. IS PURA § 39.452(b) explicitly prohibits the Commission from issuing a decision\naddressing the Company's CGS program \"that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or\npolicy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.,,16 The System Agreement\nconstitutes an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having\njurisdiction, within the meaning of that provision. Because the System Agreement prohibits a\nsingle Operating Company, such as ETI, from unilaterally selecting and purchasing a resource to\nsupply its energy needs, ETI posits that the CGS program cannot: (1) result in the purchase of\nresources other than those that would have been selected and purchased pursuant to the System\nAgreement; or (2) require a different economic dispatch of resources or allocation of power and\nassociated costs among the Operating Companies than would occur pursuant to the System\nAgreement. 17\n\n\n       ETI generally asserts that its CGS proposal complies with the statute by making QF put\nto the Entergy System from ETl's service territory available to participating customers at the\navoided cost rate paid to QFs for that energy.

Eligible Customers\n\n\n         Participation in the CGS tariff is limited to LIPS customers.                 The parties, however,\ndisagree over the definition of \"eligible customers\" under PURA § 39.452(b). Cities and the\nState propose expanding the program to include additional and perhaps all customer classes. ETI\ncounters that the limitation to LIPS is supported by the statute and practical constraints on the\nmakeup of a customer class. Although the ALJ ultimately recommends rejection of ETl's CGS\nproposal, in the event the Commission approves the tariff, the limitation to LIPS customers is\nacceptable for initial implementation of the program. 20\n\n\n         ETI argues that the term \"eligible\" naturally implies a limitation on customer class and\nthat the provision is not explicit as to the parameters of eligibility. However, based on the\nbackground and context ofPURA § 39.452(b), ETI argues that the term \"manufacturers\" should\nbe viewed as a reference to large manufacturing concerns such as industrial customers. 21 ETI\nalso argues that the limitation to LIPS was based on a number of practical factors, including:\n\n\n\n\n        18    ETI Ex. 73 at 13, Ex.

Based on ETl's\nproposal, a limited pool of eligible customers also results in allocating unrecovered costs across a\nlarger pool of non-participants.              This will mitigate the potential impact on all customers,\nincluding, as required by the statute, non-participating manufacturers.            On the flipside, ETI\nargues that expanding the pool of eligible customers would increase start-up and implementation\ncosts, spread over a smaller pool of non-participants -- something Cities concedes. 23 According\nto established rate setting principles, ETI argues those increased costs should be borne by the\nlarger pool of eligible customers. ETI notes, however, there is little to no likelihood, and no\nevidence that Cities' proposed expanded customer class would actually participate in the\nprogram. Finally, under the current proposal, any increase in the amount of unrecovered costs\nwould also be borne by non-participants, including manufacturers.\n\n\n       Although the State's witness also testified that the customer class should be expanded,\nCities framed strong arguments that the LIPS limitation should be rejected. Cities propose that\nthe program be available to any customer who has the demand and resources to contract for\nCGS. Cities acknowledges not every customer will possess the means to contract for or accept\nsuch service. Nevertheless, Cities contend that ETl's limit to the LIPS class is too narrow.\n\n\n\n\n       22   ETI Ex. 9 at 10-11; Tr. at 253.\n       23   Cities Initial Brief at 8-9.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                   PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                        PAGE 11\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n       First, Cities argue that LIPS class customers do not possess a monopoly of sophistication\nto contract for CGS service. Where demand is concerned, Cities note that some non-LIPS\ncustomers' combined demand may exceed 5 MW, in addition to the fact that some suppliers may\nbe willing to contract for less than 5 MW. As for interval data recording meters, Cities argue\nthat some customers' demand is constant, such as the City of Beaumont, which has some 10,000\nstreet lights for which billing is unmetered. Although Cities provided no record cites for these\npropositions, its main point is that certain customers outside the LIPS class may be in a position\nto contract for and benefit from the CGS program. Finally, with regard to increased startup and\nadministration costs associated with an expanded customer class, Cities proposes that only\nparticipants be responsible for cost recovery on a kWh basis.\n\n\n       Staffs position is that, while the term \"eligible\" is a limitation on the customer class, the\nprovision's reference to \"manufacturers\" does not mandate the program's limitation to LIPS\ncustomers. Not all LIPS customers are manufacturers and some manufacturers may be members\nof commercial classes. 24 Nevertheless, Staff also acknowledges there may be other issues which\njustify ETI's limitation to customers in the LIPS class.\n\n\n       The ALl agrees with ETI and Staff that the term \"eligible\" in PURA § 39.452(b) implies\nETI should limit participation in the program to certain customers. Although the provision does\nnot define the terms of eligibility, the reference to \"manufacturers\" suggests that the program\nshould be extended to ETI's larger customers, but as noted by Cities, Staff, and other opponents,\nthe LIPS class is not a perfect fit for all of ETI's customers engaged in manufacturing.\nNevertheless, the ALl finds that ETI has articulated a reasonable and practical limit on the CGS\neligible customer class for the implementation of the program. Based on the uncertain nature of\nETI's cost estimates and unknown levels of participation, there are too many unexplored\nvariables involved in expanding the customer class beyond LIPS customers at this time. In the\nevent the Commission approves the CGS proposal, the ALl recommends eligible customers be\nlimited to the LIPS class, leaving open the possibility for further expansion as the program\ndevelops.\n\n\n\n       24   Cities share this view.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Eligible Suppliers\n\n\n       As proposed by ETI, eligible suppliers for the CGS program are limited to fourteen QFs\nwithin ETl's service territory.25 These QFs are facilities that generate power for their own use,\nand then sell their excess power to ETI. ETI is required by federal law to purchase that excess\npower regardless of the CGS program. 26 ETI claims that QF suppliers within its own service\narea are the only source of power it could incorporate into the CGS program without running\nafoul of the System Agreement, because energy put by QFs located in ETl's service territory is\nallocated to ETI through the System Agreement, so that dedicating that energy to CGS supply\ndoes not upset the allocation of energy or costs among the Entergy Operating Companies. 27 ETI\nalso describes QF put as a viable supply option for the CGS program because the delivery of that\nenergy can be controlled by the CGS customer and the QF.\n\n\n       Cities and other intervenors generally argue that the limitation on eligible suppliers does\nnot do enough to bring competition to the market. TlEC witness Jeffry Pollock echoed this\nconcern when he testified that there is simply not enough capacity available in ETl's plan to\nallow for true competition. 28 Aside from the limited number of QFs eligible to participate,\ncompetition is further limited because QFs must first meet their own power needs before they put\nto ETI. 29 And Cities argue that even if IPPs currently dedicated to serving ETI are added to the\nsupply, there is still too little competition, because that power is already under contract by ETI or\nis required to be purchased by ETI.\n\n\n       ETI responds, and the ALJ agrees, that PURA § 39.452(b) does not require ETI to\ndevelop a CGS program that mimics an open market. That would be impossible. ETI is a\nregulated entity and part of a multi-state utility system, whose available resources and resource\nand cost allocations are governed by the Operating Committee as sanctioned by the FERC. It is\n\n\n       25   TIEC Ex. 1 at 14.\n       26   Tr. at 51,67-68.\n       27   ETI Ex. 73 at 11-12.\n       28   TIEC Ex. 1 at 38.\n       29   TIEC Ex. 1 at 67-68.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Instead, the CGS program is intended to give eligible customers a supply\nalternative to ETI's generation. It is not intended to be retail open access, and the amendments\nto the CGS provision in the 2009 legislation law make it clear that the program should not make\nthe CGS customer a wholesale market participant.\n\n\n                  a.       Expanding the Supply to Include IPPs\n\n\n        TIEC proposes that CGS suppliers be expanded to include IPPs currently dedicated to\nserving ETI. ETI argues, however, that while this proposal would avoid interference with the\nresource allocation principles of the System Agreement, it still runs afoul of the economic\ndispatch requirements of the System Agreement. ETI points out that the System Agreement\ndictates the dispatch of System resources using the lowest cost resources capable of reliably\nserving load for the System as a whole and without regard to which Operating Company owns or\ncontrols the resource. The System Agreement does not permit the dispatch of certain resources\nout of order for the benefit of a single Operating Company or customers in a particular\njurisdiction.30\n\n\n        ETI argues that including IPP suppliers would be detrimental to CGS customers because\nthey have no control over the delivery of energy from IPPs. Because System economics dictate\nthe scheduling of energy from IPPs, System needs may not align with the needs CGS customers\nin any given hour. Under these circumstances, the System's economic dispatch decisions for\nIPPs would prevail and CGS customers would incur significant Unserved Energy costs when IPP\nresources selected by a CGS customer are not included in economic dispatch for a period of\n     3\ntime. ! Cities made the same argument in briefing, also noting \"CGS must be limited to power\nthat is already allocated to ETI under the terms of the System Agreement.,,32 The ALJ agrees\nwith ETI that using QF put allows the CGS customer and QF to agree on delivery terms that\n\n\n\n       30   ETI Ex. 41 at 9-10.\n       31   ETI Ex. 73 at 11-16.\n       32   ETI Ex. 73 at 11-12.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Cities\npoint out that, at most, the Company only has capacity contracts with two-fifths of the IPPs in its\nservice territory.35\n\n\n        There is insufficient evidence, however, to determine what the impact of including IPPs\nin the COS power supply would be. IPPs could presumably be a source of firm power under the\nprogram, which would allow the Company to eliminate the costs it would have incurred to\nprovide firm power to its COS customers rather than simply passing those costs on to ineligible\ncustomers. On the other hand, the Company claims that its System Agreement precludes it from\nincluding IPPs in its pool of eligible suppliers,36 and including IPPs could raise fuel costs for\nother customers because COS customers could effectively skim the lower-priced fuel out of\nETI's supply.37 OPUC witness Clarence Johnson pointed out that the impact of including IPPs\nas eligible suppliers may be to increase purchased power costs for non-COS customers. 38 To the\nextent that including IPPs in the COS power supply would harm non-participating customers,\nCities opposes such a modification to the CGS tariff. If, however, the CGSUSC rider were either\nrejected or modified so that it does not shift unrecovered costs to ineligible customers and other\nprotections were put in place, Cities would recommend including IPPs as a way to make the\nCOS program truly competitive. As explained below, however, if such costs are recovered from\nCOS participants, there is little conceivable incentive for participation in the program. The ALJ\nconcludes that expanding the pool of suppliers to IPPs and QFs not currently under capacity\n\n\n       33   !d.\n       34   Tr. at 129-130.\n       35   Tr. at 54.\n       36   ETI Ex. 52 at 36, note 4.\n       37   Tr. at 129.\n       38   OPC Ex. 4 at 10, Ex.

Expanding the Supply to Include Cottonwood\n\n\n           Cottonwood seeks to participate in the CGS program as a supplier. Cottonwood argues\nthat it is on equal footing with QFs.              ETl argues, however, that PURPA only requires the\nCompany to purchase QF put, not that of an independent generator like Cottonwood.\nCottonwood also argues that ETl would not actually purchase QF put for CGS customers. ETl\nand the ALl disagree. PURA § 39.452(b) states: \"pursuant to the competitive generation tariff,\nan electric utility subject to this subsection shall purchase competitive generation service ... ,,39\nFinally, Cottonwood suggests that the System Agreement be amended to permit Cottonwood to\nparticipate in the CGS program. As noted by ETl, this would interfere with the FERC-approved\nSystem Agreement, which is specifically prohibited by PURA § 39.452(b). The ALl concludes\nthat Cottonwood's proposal to be included as an eligible CGS supplier should be denied.\n\n\n                      c.      Expanding the Supply to Include Out-of-State QFs\n\n\n           TIEC proposes to expand the CGS supply pool by including QFs located elsewhere on\nthe Entergy System. Under that proposal, a CGS customer in Texas would be permitted to\ncontract for energy supply from a QF in Louisiana. ETI opposes this proposal, arguing that it\nwould upset energy allocation under the System Agreement because it would require allocation\nof energy put by a Louisiana QF to ETl. ETl argues that the Operating Committee has already\nexercised its discretion on this issue and determined that QF put is to be allocated to the host\nOperating Company.40 ETI notes that the Operating Committee has never allocated QF put from\none Operating Company's service area to an Operating Company in another jurisdiction. 41 ETl\nargues that implementation of the CGS program does not justifies such a change. The ALl\nagrees.\n\n          39   PURA § 39.452(b).\n          40   ETI Ex. 73 at 12-13, Ex. IPH-R-2.\n          41   Tr. at 89.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

The Supreme Court has held that\nmatters delegated to the Operating Committee as part of its duties to administer the System\nAgreement are matters of exclusive FERC jurisdiction.42 As a result, there is no basis for a state\nregulator to direct how QF put should be allocated among the Entergy Operating Companies.\n\n\n        ETl argues that even TIEC's expert witness Jeffry Pollock acknowledged that the\nreallocation of lower-cost QF put from Louisiana customers to Texas customers could raise costs\nto Louisiana customers to benefit Texas CGS customers. 43 ETl witness John Hurstell testified\nthat expanding the pool of CGS energy suppliers as proposed by TIEC requires abandonment of\nthe System Agreement to allocate out-of-state QF pUt,44 The ALJ agrees with ETl that, even if\nTIEC's proposal did not violate the System Agreement, it makes little sense for the Operating\nCommittee to reallocate QF put for the sole purpose of expanding the CGS supply pool for the\nbenefit of a small number of Texas industrial customers and the detriment of customers in other\nEntergy System jurisdictions.          Finally, ETl questions whether the Commission could even\nenforce such an obligation.\n\n\n       Cities note that including QFs outside of ETl's servIce area may benefit eligible\ncustomers by increasing the diversity of available power and providing a more competitive\nmarket,45 Cities, however, only supports the inclusion of QFs outside ETl's service area, if it\nwould not increase costs to non-participating customers.                This is not likely under the CGS\nprogram, because supply options are still limited to QFs, which have discretion to put energy to\nETl. As explained below, ETl's current proposal contemplates no system capacity cost savings,\nbecause it considers QF put as non-firm and must plan its resources as if the CGS customer\n                                46\nremains a normal LIPS customer.

Cost Recovery Riders\n\n\n         ETI's two cost-recovery riders are based on forecasted data, in amounts unspecified at\nhearing, and to be updated through an annual true-up proceeding. Opponents of the program\nfocus on the prospective nature of these riders and ETI's inability to provide accurate or final\ncost figures. They argue that both riders should be rejected as piecemeal, premature, and not\nbased on costs that are known and measurable.              Opponents propose that any costs may be\ncaptured in a subsequent proceeding based on a historical test year once they are known and\n                48\nmeasurable.          They argue that allowable expenses are limited under PUC SUBST. R. 25.231(b) to\nexpenses that are reasonable and necessary to provide service.\n\n\n         ETI argues that the opponents' proposals to defer recovery of costs do not comply with\nPURA § 39.452(b)'s directive that rates be set in this proceeding to recover ETI's unrecovered\ncosts as a result of the CGS tariff. ETI also argues that deferral of cost recovery does not\nconstitute rate setting under Texas Supreme Court precedent. ETI points out that the Texas\nSupreme Court specifically rejected claims that deferred accounting should be considered as the\nsetting of rates. The court ruled that deferral of costs was no more than setting aside the costs, so\nthat a rate for their recovery could be considered in a future proceeding. 49\n\n\n        Under normal rate-making standards, the ALI would be inclined to agree with the\nopponents. However, the plain language of PURA § 39.452(b) requires that \"the utility's rates\nshall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as\na result of the implementation of the tariff,\" and the CGS tariff \"may not be considered to offer a\n\n\n        47   OPC Ex. 4 at 10.\n        48   TIEC Ex. 1 at 10.\n\n        49 State v.

The ALJ finds that the CGS legislation requires that the rate set in this matter\ninclude the recovery of any cost ETI reasonably anticipates incurring as a result of the CGS\nprogram, based on the Company's estimates, to be trued-up with actual costs in one year.\nHowever, opponents ofETl's proposal are correct that there may be benefits to non-participating\ncustomers or reduced costs to ETI, that should also be accounted for at the annual true-up\ncontemplated by both cost-recovery riders.\n\n\n         1.         CGSC Rider\n\n\n         Rider CGSC is designed to recover costs related to implementation and administration\ncosts incurred to support the CGS program. These costs would be recovered from all CGS\neligible (LIPS) customers through Rider CGSC, regardless of whether they actually take the\nCGS service. Because the costs are currently estimated, the CGSC Rider is set for an annual\ntrue-up to costs actually incurred. 52\n\n\n         While no party argues that ETI should not be able to recover its startup and\nadministration costs, the parties disagree with the timing and specifics of ETl's proposed CGSC\nRider.        Opponents argue PURA § 36.003 requires an electric utility's rates to be just and\nreasonable and that the utility has the burden to show its rate change is just and reasonable.\nThese parties contend that ETI failed to meet that burden, because it provided insufficient\nevidence of specific costs, opting instead for estimates. In other words there are currently no\ncosts upon which to base a rate and State witness Pevoto testified that estimates should not be\nused to establish rates in this proceeding. 53 As a result, the parties argue that Rider CGSC is\npremature and should be delayed until specific figures are available.\n\n\n         50   PURA § 39.452(b).\n         51   ETI Ex. 9 at PRM-1 at 7; Tr. at 20, 161, 175.\n         52   ETl Ex. 9 at 14,20.\n         53   State Ex. 1 at 41-42.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

The ALl notes that fuel reconciliations\noccur with regularity at the Commission and are analogous to the Company's proposed true-up\nmechanism for the        cas program.55       The ALl recommends that ETI recover in this proceeding,\nits estimated startup and administrative costs through Rider          casc, to be trued-up with actual\ncosts in one year.\n\n\n        TIEC and Staff also seek to limit the application of Rider       casc\n                                                                   to customers that elect to\nparticipate in the CGS program. 56 This argument has merit, because there is no discemable\nbenefit to the LIPS class customers who do not participate in the CGS program. As noted by\nStaff witness Stephen Mendoza, the rider \"would seem to go against a cost causation principle\nwhereby costs are allocated to those customers who cause the costs to be incurred.,,57\n\n\n       There is also the possibility that non-participating LIPS class manufacturers would suffer\na competitive disadvantage. PURA § 39.452(b) specifically requires that:\n\n       The commission shall ensure that a competitive generation tariff shall not be\n       implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of\n       manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.58\n\n\n\n       54   PURA § 39.452(b).\n       55   ETl Ex. 76 at 32.\n       56   Staff Ex. 3 at 12-13; TlEC Ex. 1 at 46-47.\n       57   Staff Ex. 3 at 12.\n       58   PURA § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

ETI witness Phillip May justified\nrecovering these costs from LIPS class customers who decide not to participate because \"those\ncustomers have the opportunity to sign up for and benefit from the CGS program.\"S9 But this\nargument ignores the plain language of PURA § 39.452(b) that prohibits competitive\ndisadvantage to those manufacturers who elect not to participate. The parameters of competitive\nharm, however, were not spelled-out in the provision, nor is there specific evidence in the record\nof such harm.\n\n\n       ETI also points out that limiting Rider CGSC to participants may result in the Company\nincurring the costs of implementation.       ETI witness May testified that, because there is a\npossibility that no customers will participate, the Company would be unable to recover its start-\nup and administrative costs if the rider is limited to CGS participants. 6o\n\n\n        This raises a potential conflict brought about by the language ofPURA § 39.452(b), and\nanother reason the ALJ recommends against implementation of the program. Nevertheless, if\nPURA § 39.452(b) is to be read in a manner to avoid conflict, the ALJ recommends that ETI has\nproposed a reasonable compromise. The ALJ agrees that requiring any non-participant in the\nCGS program to share in its costs violates the principle of cost causation. Yet, even Staff agrees\nthat PURA § 39.452(b) states the CGS tariffs \"may not be considered to offer a discount rate or\nrates under Section 36.007.\" PURA § 36.007(d) reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the commission shall ensure that\n       the electric utility's allocable costs of serving customers paying discounted rates\n       under this section are not borne by the utility's other customers.\n\nAs a result, Staff acknowledges the prohibition against \"other customers\" bearing the costs of a\ndiscounted rate appears not to apply here. Assuming this is the legislature's intent, ETI could\n\n\n       59   ETI Ex. 9 at 19,20.\n       60   ETI Ex. 76 at 32-33.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

What is clear, however, is that if Rider- CGSC applies\n only to participants and no entities participate, the Company would be left with unrecovered\nstartup costs, a result expressly prohibited by PURA § 39.452(b). If the Commission approves\nETI's proposal, the ALl supports limiting Rider CGSC to CGS participants.                             However, to\n address ETI's legitimate concern over the potential of being left with the costs, the ALl\nrecommends that Rider CGSC initially be implemented as proposed by ETI. However, once the\nprogram has participants, all costs should be shifted to those participants immediately or at the\nannual true-up.           A refund could be issued to non-participants concurrent with the cost\nreallocation. The ALl understands that this issue has not been fully explored, but ETI indicated\nin briefing that it is open to suggestions.\n\n\n          2.         CGSUSC Rider\n\n\n         Rider CGSUSC provides for the Company's recovery from non-participating customers\nof the embedded generation costs that it will lose from customers that elect to participate in the\nCGS program. It is intended to recover embedded generation costs and any other related base\nrate costs and would apply to all non-participating customers across all classes, including LIPS\ncustomers not participating in the CGS program. 61 As with Rider CGSC, the Company proposes\nan annual true-up of estimated unrecovered costs to the costs actually unrecovered. 62 ETI notes\nthe annual true-up will also provide an opportunity to consider potential adjustments in light of\nthe level of participation in CGS and its impact on other classes. 63\n\n\n\n\n         61    ETI Ex. 9 at 14, 15,21.\n         62    ETI Ex. 9 at 21-22.\n        63 ETI Ex. 9 at 23-24. While the Company has not proposed a cap on the level of CGS participation, it\nrecognized that this is a means oflimiting the exposure of non-participating classes to unrecovered costs.

These parties contend that ETl is essentially seeking to recover\nlost revenues, not costs. Parties opposed to the rider argue no rate should be set in this case to\naccount for unrecovered costs.     Instead, such unrecovered costs should be recovered from\nincreased revenues from load growth, or from other savings that may be associated with the CGS\nprogram.\n\n\n\n       ETl argues these positions should be rejected because they are at odds with the\nrequirements of the governing statute and with fundamental rate setting principles. As argued by\nETI the \"unrecovered costs\" referenced in PURA § 39.452(b) and the \"lost revenue\" that ETI has\ncalculated as the measure of the unrecovered costs are one and the same in the ratesetting\ncontext. ETl points out that OPUC witness Johnson acknowledged in his direct testimony that\n\"[r]evenues are intended to equal embedded cost of service for the adjusted test year.,,64 TIEC\nwitness Pollock also agreed at hearing the Company's unrecovered revenues calculation would\naccount for the migrating customers' share of the Company's embedded fixed production costS. 65\n\n\n\n       The ALJ agrees with ETl that PURA § 39.452(b) requires that \"the utility's rates shall be\nset, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result\nof the implementation of the tariff,\" and that the CGS legislation specifically authorizes the\nCompany to recover any unrecovered costs as \"a result of' implementation of the CGS\nprogram. 66 ETI is entitled to collect unrecovered embedded generation costs and any other\nrelated base rate costs as a result of customer migration to the CGS program.\n\n\n\n       The ALJ agrees that ETI's revenue requirement is based on and designed to recover such\ncosts. With every customer that migrates to the CGS program, ETl loses a customer and suffers\n\"load loss.\" That is, the pool of customers contributing to the recovery of ETl's embedded\n\n\n       64   Tr. at 350-351.\n       6S   Tr. at 261-262,356.\n       66   ETI Ex. 76 at 28-29.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Load loss is detrimental to the\nCompany in the opposite manner that load growth benefits the Company. Additional customers\nmean the base rate quantum is spread over a larger pool. Furthermore, the same parties who\noppose Rider CGSUSC also contend ETl should offset the rider with load growth. Under normal\ncircumstances, the ALJ would agree with those parties opposed to COSUSC, because ETl is only\nentitled to seek, but is not guaranteed a set return on its investment.          However, PURA\n§ 39.452(b) mandates ETI recover \"any\" of its unrecovered costs as a result of the\nimplementation of the program.      Opponents of Rider COSUSC have failed to identify any\ncaveats to this expansive language. As a result, the ALJ concludes that ETl is entitled to recover\nthe unrecovered embedded generation costs and any related base rate costs as a result of\ncustomer migration to the COS program. As discussed below, however, that recovery should be\noffset against load growth and any identifiable capacity savings at the annual true-up.\n\n\n       The most troubling aspect of Rider COSUSC is that it recovers the unrecovered costs\nfrom all non-participating ratepayers. As with the arguments for and against Rider CGSC, Staff\nand a number of intervenors argue Rider COSUSC should be rejected because it is inconsistent\nwith the principal of cost-causation. Although the migrating COS customers cause the costs to\nbe incurred, Rider COSUSC recovers ETl's unrecovered embedded generation costs from all\nother ratepayers, including non-LIPS class customers who are not eligible to participate in the\nCOS program. 67\n\n\n       Furthermore, having non-COS participants pay for costs related to the COS program may\ncontradict the statutory requirement that the COS tariff not harm the \"sustainability or\ncompetitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation\"\nalthough there is no evidence on whether this might occur. 68 All of the arguments regarding\nRider CGSC's potential competitive harm to non-participating manufacturers apply with greater\nforce to Rider COSUSC. Not all manufacturing customers fall within the LIPS class. Due to the\n\n\n\n\n       67   Staff Ex. 3 at 12.\n       68   PURA § 39.452(b).\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

As a result, the prohibition against allocating costs to \"other ratepayers\" under\nPURA § 36.007 does not apply. However, Staff disagrees with BTl's conclusion that PURA\n§ 39.452(b) mandates these costs be recovered only from non-CGS participants. Staff argues\nthat nothing in PURA § 39.452(b), prevents BTl from charging the CGS participants its\nunrecovered costs. While the AU agrees with Staff, a primary point ofBTI's CGS program is to\nremove itself from the market exchange between CGS customer and the QF supplier.\nRecovering unrecovered capacity/base rate costs from the migrating customer runs counter to\nthis purpose.        Although, the AU agrees with BTl that recovering these costs from CGS\nparticipants would make the CGS program economically unattractive, PURA § 39.452(b) does\nnot mandate that such unrecovered costs be recovered from non-participating customers. 70 There\nis no easy resolution to this issue. Although the ALI provides further analysis below, Rider\nCGSUSC is a primary reason that he recommends the proposal be denied, because it runs\ncontrary to the fundamental ratemaking principle of cost causation and may harm the\ncompetitiveness of non-participating manufacturers.\n\n\n                   a.       Cost Estimates\n\n\n        One of the greatest concerns stated by opponents is that the amount of potentially\nunrecovered costs is unknown. BTl estimates that if all LIPS class customer were to contract for\nan alternative QF supply for 100 percent of their load, BTl could potentially realize 75.2 million\ndollars in avoided embedded generation costs for the eligible CGS load. Company witness May\ntestified that the Company already knows the unit cost of embedded generation that would be\navoided.      The only question is what the level of participation will be.           ETl cannot predict\n\n\n      69 PURA § 39.452(b)'s competitive language only applies to manufacturers who elect not to participate.\nThe AU acknowledges that non-LIPS class customers cannot participate.\n        70   ETI Ex. 76 at 32-33.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

However, Mr. Pollock\nadmitted these figures were based on 200 megawatts of participation, which was \"pulled out of\nthin air.,,73     The uncertainty associated with these figures is that the number of LIPS-class\ncustomers who will participate in the CGS program is unknown.\n\n\n        Because PURA § 36.003 requires that an electric utility's rates be just and reasonable, the\nelectric utility proposing a rate change has the burden of proof on that issue. Given that the\npotential costs of the CGS program are unknown and could be very substantial, opponents argue\nthat ETl has failed to show that Rider CGSUSC would result in just and reasonable rates. ETI\npoints out that the unrecovered costs will ultimately be trued-up. Opponents respond that the\ntrue-up will not occur until a year after the implementation of the program, resulting in\nratepayers being charged as much as 75 million dollars for the first year of the program. 74 They\nargue it is unreasonable for ratepayers to be charged a large, unsupported amount, especially\nwhen they do not cause ETl to incur these costs or benefit from the CGS program.\n\n\n         The ALJ agrees. The shifting of such unrecovered costs to rate-payers who do not cause\ntheir lack of recovery and the uncertainty associated with the ultimate amount to be charged\nother classes is another major reason for the ALl's recommended rejection of this program. This\nis not, however, a criticism of ETI. ETl was given the difficult task of developing a semi-\ncompetitive program for a limited number of customers, using its own distribution system and in\nspite of its limitations as a regulated entity and member of an integrated multi-state utility\n\n\n         71   ETI Ex. 9 at 14; Tr. at 157, 158, 162-163.\n         72   TIEe Ex. 1 at 51-52 and Ex.

The Company notes that while the portion of embedded\ngeneration costs subject to loss under the CGS program is known with certainty, the volume of\nload associated with those unrecovered costs will only be known once the program begins and\nparticipation levels are known. 7S All of these restrictions contributed to ETl's difficulty in\ndeveloping exact cost figures.\n\n\n        The AU finds that ETl has made a good faith effort to determine the unit cost of\nunrecovered embedded generation, but simply cannot predict the level of participation. In so\ndoing, ETl has given the Commission a worst-case scenario of 75 million dollars in unrecovered\ncosts if every eligible customer participates. Because a rate must be set in this proceeding, if the\nCommission approves ETl's CGS program, the ALJ recommends the rate be set based on ETl's\nprojections until the first annual true-up period, after which ETl may use known and measurable\ncosts to set rates in the future, taking into account load growth and other potential benefits of the\nprogram as discussed below.\n\n\n                   b.      Annual True-ups Should Account for Load Growth\n\n\n       Staff and opponents of Rider CGSUSC argue it is deficient because it fails to account for\nload growth, which could mitigate ETl's unrecovered generation-related costS. 76 TIEC witness\nPollock explained that as load grows:\n\n\n       each additional unit of energy sold will provide a contribution to all fixed costs\n       including embedded generation costs [and that] any reduction in embedded\n       generation cost recovery attributable to the CGS program [will] be more than\n       offset by increased revenues due to load growth. 77\n\nAlthough it remains to be see~ whether the reduction in cost recovery will be completely offset\nby load growth, it should nevertheless be accounted for. The potential amount of unrecovered\ncosts is substantial and ETl seeks to recover these costs from ratepayers who don't cause them\n\n       75   Tr. at 162.\n       76   Tr. at 372.\n       77   TIEe Ex. 1 at 50.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

As a result, opponents argue that any\npotential cost mitigation should be accounted for in designing Rider CGSUSC. The ALl agrees,\nand notes that at a minimum, load growth should be explored in the annual true-ups ofthe rider.\n\n\n         ETI points out that the unrecovered costs at issue here are the embedded test year\nproduction costs upon which the Company's base rates are being established. ETI explains that\nincremental changes in future costs and revenues do not play into the determination of how such\ncosts are recovered. 78 Instead, rates are set in the first instance to recover the historical cost of\nservice. Incremental future changes in revenue from load growth or future cost savings are\ndevoted to covering incremental future cost increases and to ensuring that shareholders still have\nan opportunity to earn a fair return despite these future increases. 79 The Company argues that its\napproach to unrecovered costs honors these fundamental rate setting principles: it preserves the\nCompany's opportunity to recover the existing embedded costs that its rates are set to recover,\nwhile the other parties' use of load growth and alleged future cost savings violates these\nprinciples.\n\n\n        ETI also notes that the Commission has previously recognized that load growth\nadjustments such as those suggested by opponents are inappropriate. Staff witness Mendoza, for\nexample, acknowledged the Commission's rejection of a base revenue/load growth adjustment in\nadopting its rule implementing the transmission cost recovery legislation codified in PURA\n§ 36.209. The Commission found that it was \"not necessary or appropriate\" to \"account for\ngrowth in overall revenue as a means to reduce the transmission costs eligible for recovery.... ,,80\nThe Commission found that such an adjustment would discourage utility investment and that the\nimpact of such load growth was more properly considered within the context of a future general\nrate setting proceeding. 8 !\n\n\n\n\n        78   Tr. at 356.\n        79   Tr. at 351-352.\n\n      80 Tr. at 358.

However, Rider CGSUSC recovers ETl's unrecovered base rate\ncosts as a result of load loss from all ratepayers who are not beneficiaries of the CGS program.\nThis violates the principal of cost causation. As a result, the ALJ recommends that load growth\nshould be accounted for to the extent that non-participating ratepayers are subsidizing CGS\nprogram participants.\n\n\n         ETl also argues that its costs are likely to increase cancelling out any load growth. ETl\nclaims that recent increases in non-fuel operating and maintenance costs have outpaced, and\nfuture forecast increases will continue to outpace, the Company's forecasted load growth due to\na number of factors. Company witness May explained that distribution costs, transmission costs,\nand generation costs have all increased at a greater rate than the increase in the Consumer Price\nIndex. ETI also argues that regulators' push for increased energy efficiency has reduced the rate\nof load growth increase. Increasing utility reliance on the maturing wholesale markets has\nchanged the traditional model of cost recovery to one where increased purchased capacity\nexpense must be captured through frequent rate case filings. 82 As a result, ETl claims that load\ngrowth cannot account for additional costs in the way it has in the past. Opponents generally\nargue that ETl's assumptions regarding its future costs lack evidentiary support or are unreliable.\nThe ALI finds that even if ETI is correct, cost increases affecting load growth is an issue that can\nbe addressed during the annual true-up proceeding.\n\n\n         ETl also cited the Commission's transmission cost recovery factor (TCRF) rule for\nutilities outside of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as support for not using\npotential load growth in designing Rider CGSUSC. 83 Staff argues, however, that the rule\naccounts for load growth, and protects ratepayers, because it requires the refund of any over-\nrecovery as a result of load growth, but prohibits the surcharge of any under-recovery.84 In its\n\n\n\n        82   ETI Ex. 76 at16; 202-205; Tr. at 192,201-206.\n        83   Tr. at 357-360.\n         84  Tr. at 357-360; P.D.C.

To do so would\n        undermine the underlying purpose of HB 989 to encourage timely investment in\n        non-ERCOT transmission infrastructure. 86\n\n\nStaff also notes that in the non-ERCOT TCRF rulemaking the Commission noted that non-\ntransmission costs could grow faster than the increased revenues resulting from the TCRF, which\nwas also an implicit recognition that the opposite could be true.\n\n\n        According to Staff, the TCRF rule is designed to encourage investment in non-ERCOT\ntransmission infrastructure.      The CGS program, however, should be designed neither to\nencourage nor discourage participation. Instead, Staff argues the program should be cost-based\nto the extent possible and contends that PURA § 39.452(b) expresses a policy against cross-\nsubsidization by prohibiting implementation in a manner that \"harms the sustainability or\ncompetitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.\"\nIn light of this legislative policy and the limited scope of eligible customers, inaccuracies in the\nallocation of costs should be resolved in favor of over-allocating costs to the program rather than\nunder-allocating costs to the program. Thus, Staff argues that accounting for load growth in the\nCGS program is appropriate.\n\n\n        ETI argues that if the Legislature had intended to include a load growth adjustment as\npart of a mechanism for cost recovery, it would have done so. ETI notes that in the same bill that\nfirst addressed the CGS program, the Legislature explicitly included a load growth adjustment in\nthe context of the Incremental Purchased Capacity Rider:\n\n\n\n\n       85 Project No. 33253, Order Adopting New § 25.39 as Approved at the December 7,2007 Open Meeting\n(December 14,2007) at 14.\n       86 Project No. 33253, Order Adopting New §25.39 as Approved at the December 7, 2007 Open Meeting\n(December 14, 2007) at 14.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

As Staff notes, PURA § 39.455 concerns the recovery of incremental\ncosts and the express recognition of incremental load (load growth) is logical in that context.\nPURA § 39.455 specifically references \"necessary costs of incremental resources required to\nmeet load requirements to the extent those costs result in the utility expending more for capacity\ncosts under purchase power agreements than were included in the utility's last base rate\ncase ... ,,88 In contrast, PURA § 39.452(b) lacks specificity about such cost recovery, using only\nthe term \"any\" in reference to costs.         If the vague term \"any\" is broad enough to include\nunrecovered base rate costs, as argued by ETI, then the ALJ finds that it should also be read as\ninclusive of traditional offsets to those costs, such as load growth.\n\n\n                 c.      Potential Benefits of the CGS Program\n\n\n                         i.      Capacity Savings\n\n\n       Opponents of the CGS program argue that ETI failed to identify a number of potential\nbenefits for non-participating customers. TlEC provided substantial briefing on this issue and\nthe ALI's analysis focuses on its arguments among opponents.            TIEC points out that the\nCommission has long recognized that QF power may be used to avoid a utility's capacity and\nenergy costs. In Docket No. 5994, for example, the Commission held:\n\n       It is generally recognized that QF power may be used for two purposes. The first\n       purpose, which is the primary thrust of Section 201 of PURPA, is the\n       displacement of a utility's fuel with that of QFs to achieve a more efficient use of\n\n       87   PURA § 39.455 (emphasis added).\n       88   PURA § 39.455.\n\f SOAH DOCKET NO.

The second purpose is the substitution of QF generating plant\n          for utility-constructed generating plant.   That is, rather than constructing\n          generating plant to serve its system demand, the utility should utilize, where\n          practical, the generating plant of QFs. 89\n\n\n TIEC argues the Commission's rules establish how avoided costs for QF capacity and energy\n should be addressed,90 and that the Commission has addressed how avoided costs may be\n determined for firm and as-available QF power and what constitutes firm or non-firm QF\n power. 91\n\n\n\n          First, TIEC argues that the CGS program would reduce ETI's capacity costs.                         It is\n undisputed that ETI is a capacity short company that pays capacity costs each month for\n purchased power and for its share of Entergy System capacity reserves. 92 According to ETI,\n purchased capacity costs, including capacity costs from its affiliates, were a significant\n component of the Company's cost of service and constituted 34 percent of the company's non-\n fuel revenue requirement.93 Even though ETI recently entered into several purchased power\n contracts, ETI's capacity deficit is expected to worsen over time and its load is growing at an\n                                        94\n estimated average rate of 1.8 percent. As a result, TIEC urges the Commission to deem CGS\npower as a firm source of generation, with the added benefit of reduced capacity costs for all of\nETI's customers.\n\n\n\n\n         89 Petition of Inquiry into the Rates Paid by Houston Lighting and Power Company to Qualifying Facilities\nfor the Purchase of Non-Firm Energy, Docket No. 5994, 12 Tex.

LIPS customers account for 23 percent of ETl's total\ndemand. 95 If demand-related costs could be reduced by moving firm LIPS customers to CGS\nload, the CGS program could possibly benefit all of ETl's customers through reduced MSS-l\ncosts and reduced capacity ETl currently procures in the market to serve LIPS customers. To\nrecognize these savings, however, ETl would have to treat the QF put as firm load - which it\ncannot. TIEC proposes a number of different ideas for achieving this. TIEC proposes that the\nOperating Company could recognize participating QFs as IPPs and enter into negotiated rates\nwith the QFS. 96 Capacity cost savings would result from a firm capacity contract with each QF,\n                                                                                                            97\nas demonstrated by EGSl's contract with Calpine's Carville facility, a QF located in Louisiana.\nHowever, the Commission does not have the authority to compel the Operating Committee to do\nso and ETI is subject to the Operating Committee's decisions on this issue.\n\n\n         TIEC also argues that a specific contract with ETl is not a pre-condition to treating QF\npower as capacity. TIEC posits the Commission could order ETl to recognize the capacity cost\nsavings resulting from a QF contract with a CGS customer. TIEC contends that FERC precedent\nand the System Agreement explicitly recognize that, if a state commission determines that\ncapacity costs can be avoided by QF purchases, that determination will affect the amount of\ncapacity deemed available for the operating company and will impact MSS-l reserve\nequalization payments under the System Agreement. 98 ETI and Staff respond that this authority\ndoes not apply to QF put from CGS suppliers, because it would not be within the utility's\ncontrol. As a result, ETI cannot recognize the capacity benefits of QF put. 99\n\n\n        TIEC claims there must be some avoided capacity costs by taking a steady stream of QF\npower. There is Commission authority for such recognition and the FERC has held that \"[s]tate\ncommission avoided cost determinations should be recognized for intra-system billing purposes\n\n\n        95   ETI Ex. 9 at 13.\n        96   Tr. at 88.\n        97   Tr. at 298; TIEC Ex. 11 at TIEC 9-9 EC1209.\n        98 Tr. at 86; TIEC Ex. 9, Entergy System Agreement at Section 10.02(f) and 2.12; State ofArk. v Middle\nSouth Servs., Inc., 34 FERC ~ 61342,61639, Opinion No. 246-A (March 17, 1986) (affrrming Opinion No. 246, 33\nFERC ~ 61408 (Dec. 23, 1985).\n        99   Tr. at 87.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

According to TIEC, the Commission has the jurisdictional authority to\ndetermine whether the power put to ETI by a QF as a result of a CGS customer's contract with\nthe QF results in firm capacity, 101 is evidence of the utility's legally enforceable obligation to\ntake that power,102 and creates avoided costs associated with the power. 103\n\n\n         TIEC acknowledges, however, that Commission rules differentiate capacity and energy\nbenefits provided by QFs based on whether the power is firm or non-firm. In Docket No. 5994,\nthe Commission determined that \"[t]he difference between firm and nonfirm primarily is the\nexistence or non-existence of a legally enforceable obligation on the behalf of the QF to provide\npower.,,104 P.u.e.

TIEC argues that ETI would experience\noperational savings due to a flatter round-the-clock load shape. As a result, ETI could eliminate\na sporadic PURPA put pattern and would not have to swing generation associated with QFs as\nmuch. TIEC argues that this would reduce the amount of capacity needed to maintain reliable\nservice. I 12\n\n\n         The obvious problem with TIEC's arguments is that they are premature. For instance,\nthere is no evidence on any of the factors to determine whether OF put is firm because the\nprogram has yet to be approved, implemented, or subscribed to. Until that happens there are no\ncontracts to be examined, nor capacity savings to be explored. In short, the record did not\nindicate whether there would actually be any capacity benefit. I 13 Mr. Pollock admitted that QF\nput does not count as capacity in ETl's resource planning, that such savings are only a potential\nbenefit, and that there has been no specific quantification of potential savings from reduced\ncapacity costS.11 4 As for operational costs, there is no evidence on load shape or decreased\nvolatility in QF put power.\n\n\n         Furthermore, as argued by Staff and ETI, Mr. Pollock acknowledged that QF put is a\nnon-finn source of energy. 115 He also acknowledged that his theory of capacity savings was\ndependent on an assumption that the QF put from which cas customers will be supplied is\ntreated as a firm resource. 116 Both Staff and ETI argue that QF put cannot be treated a finn\nsupply. First, with regards to any contract between a cas supplier and customer, the Company\nwould be a third party to the contract with no rights whatsoever stemming from that contract.\nThe fact that a cas customer might contract with a cas supplier for a \"firm\" supply of power,\ndoes not change the fact that ETI would have no control over the power put by the QF to ETI --\nthat power would still be non-firm to ETI. Second, the contract between the       cas supplier and\n\n         112    Tr. at 252, 330.\n         113    Staff Ex. 3 at 11.\n         114    Tr. at 251,291-292,315.\n         115    Tr. at 284.\n         116   Tr. at 315.\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

The Company's obligation to provide continuous, reliable service to all of its\ncustomers, including those that migrate to CGS, would remain unchanged; CGS customers must\nreceive firm service and ETI cannot plan its system any differently regardless of customer\ntype. 117 As a result, Staff and ETI argue that capacity cost savings are unlikely.\n\n\n       Staff and ETI also argue that TIEC's reliance on P.D.C. SUB ST. R. 25.242's definition of\n\"firm power\" is misplaced. The definition of \"firm power\" in the rule states: \"from a qualifying\nfacility, power or power-producing capacity that is available pursuant to a legally enforceable\nobligation for scheduled availability over a specified term.,,118 Again, the contract between the\nQF and the CGS customer is irrelevant. The purpose of the rule is \"to regulate arrangements\nbetween qualifying facilities, retail electric providers with the price to beat obligation (PTB\nREPs), and electric utilities.,,119 The rule only applies to \"all PTB REPs and to all electric\nutilities.,,120 A CGS customer is not one of these entities, and is not subject to the rule even ifit\nenters into a contract with a QF subject to the rule. The ALJ agrees with Staff and ETI. A\ncontract between a CGS customer and a QF is not subject to the rule and cannot serve as the\nbasis for finding a \"legally enforceable obligation\" between the QF and ETI to satisfy the\ndefinition of \"firm power.\"\n\n\n       At this point, the ALJ agrees with Staff and ETI that the Company cannot, nor should the\nCommission treat, CGS QF put as firm capacity. However, as noted by Mr. Pollock, because a\nCGS customer will need firm, reliable service, it is reasonable to anticipate they will enter into\ncontracts with QF suppliers for firm round-the-clock power. As a result, the ALJ anticipates (as\ndo most intervenors) that ETI's purchased capacity and MSS-l needs will drop in some\nproportion to the number of LIPS customers who migrate to the CGS program. If all non-\nparticipating ETI customers are to make up for ETI's resulting load loss, then they should also\nrealize the benefit of any capacity savings.

Potential Average Fuel Cost Savings\n\n\n         Opponents also argue that the CGS program has the potential to lower average fuel costs\nfor non-CGS participants. ETl's proposal contemplates that CGS customers will move off the\nfuel factor and instead pay energy costs at the avoided cost rate. ETl's firm customers (LIPS,\nresidential, commercial) are on ETl's fuel factor and pay average fuel costs, as opposed to\navoided fuel costs. During the reconciliation period, ETl's avoided costs of QF energy were\nhigher than its average costs of energy. As a result, these parties contend that if firm LIPS load\nhad moved to the CGS tariff during the reconciliation period, average fuel costs would have\nlowered for non-CGS participants. 121\n\n\n         ETI argues that avoided fuel costs could actually be lower than average fuel costs, but no\nparty other than TIEC provided analysis of this likelihood. In fact, both Cities witness Karl\nNalepa and ETI witness John Hurstell confirmed that, when avoided costs are higher than\naverage costs, non-CGS customers would experience lower average fuel costs; and that they had\nconducted no analysis comparing ETl's average and avoided fuel costs. I22 While there could be\ncertain times when avoided fuel costs are lower than average fuel costs, TlEC argues that\nincreases in gas prices make this scenario less likely. 123\n\n\n\n\n          121 Tr. at 229-230,311.

Staff is also\nconcerned that because potential unrecovered generation costs could be substantial, any benefits\nwould probably be inadequate to offset those costs. Staff is correct that it is premature to attempt\nto weigh the relative value of such benefits - there is no evidence on the matter. Nevertheless, in\nthe event the Commission approves ETI's CGS proposal, the ALl recommends that a review of\naverage fuel cost saving should at least be included in the annual true-up proceeding.\n\n\nc.      ETI May Recover its Costs Through a Rider\n\n\n        Cities argue that PURA § 39.452(b) limits ETI's recovery of unrecovered costs to\nprogram implementation and administration costs (CGSC costs) and prohibits recovery of\nunrecovered costs through a rider. Cities cite to the legislative history of PURA § 39.452(b),\nspecifically the Bill Analysis filed with the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 1567, to\nsupport both arguments. 125 The portion of the Bill Analysis Cities rely on states:\n\n        At the time the utility files a rate proceeding, a competitive generation tariff must\n        be proposed that the PUC shall approve, reject or modify. Any tariff that is\n        approved cannot be considered as a discounted rate and the utility's rates shall be\n        set in this proceeding to recover any costs associated with the tariff. When the\n        utility files a rate proceeding, they cannot request approval of both a rate change\n        and a rate rider mechanism.\n\nThe ALJ rejects the idea that ETI is limited to recovering CGSC costs. The language of PURA\n§ 39.452(b) imposes no such restrictions, and clearly states ETI is entitled \"to recover any costs\nunrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\"\n\n\n        Staff and ETl also disagree with Cities' interpretation ofPURA 39.452(b) stating that the\nCGS tariffs \"may not be considered to offer a discounted rates or rates under Section 36.007.\"\nCities argue that the reference to PURA § 36.007 means that ETl must recover its cost of\nproviding service to CGS customers since to recover less than its cost would mean that it would\n\n\n\n        124   Tr. at 251.\n        125   Cities Initial Brief at 13.\n\f SOAH DOCKET NO.

Cities\n do not explain why a statutory requirement that ETI recover its costs means that it is prohibited\n from recovering those costs from other ratepayers.\n\n\n          Staff argues that Section 39.452(b)'s reference to Section 36.007 means the prohibition\n against recovering costs associated with a discounted rate from other ratepayers does not apply to\n the CGS tariff and that therefore ETI can recover its unrecovered costs from other ratepayers so\n                   . . approves such a recovery. 127\n 1ong as th e CommlSSlon\n\n\n          Finally, Staff notes that Cities' argument that PURA § 39.452(b) only allows ETl to\n recover its unrecovered costs through base rates, raises another issue. Both riders include an\n annual true-up mechanism, which Staff is concerned may be retroactive ratemaking not\n                               128\n authorized by PURA.                 The Commission is currently considering a proposed rule under which\n utilities may reconcile their distribution costs of service. 129 As a result, Staff requests that the\n Commission consider resolving the retroactive ratemaking issue consistently in this docket and\n that rulemaking.\n\n\nD.       The Unserved Energy Rate\n\n\n         ETI proposes that in instances where the QF is either unable or chooses not to put energy\nto ETI, the CGS customer will take energy from ETI at the Unserved Energy rate. The proposed\nUnserved Energy rate is based on a fixed heat rate and objective market gas prices. ETl argues\nthat this approach gives the CGS customer certainty as to pricing so it can either contract for\nsuch risk with the QF or hedge that risk. ETl also asserts that the rate involves a sufficiently\n\n\n\n         126   Cities Initial Brief at 15-16.\n         127   Staff's Initial Brief at 4.\n\n        128 See Project No. 38298, Initial Comments of the Steering Committee of Cities Served by Dncor (July\n26,2010), at 16.\n\n         129 Rulemaking Related to Recovery by Electric Utilities ofDistribution Costs, Project No. 38298, Proposal\nfor Publication of New § 25.43 as Approved at the June 11,2010 Open Meeting (June 14,2010) at Section (d).\n\fSOAH DOCKET NO.

TIEC contends\nthat SMS and CGS customers are indistinguishable. l3l ETI first responds that this claim is based\non the false assumption that the Company is being supplied firm energy and capacity directly\nfrom the QF. As explained above, CGS QF put cannot be considered firm energy. ETI also\nargues that TIEC's proposal fails to recognize substantive differences between SMS and the role\nof the Unserved Energy rate. The Unserved Energy rate is not designed to function as back-up\npower as with customers that contract with ETI under SMS. Customers under the SMS tariff\nown their own generation, contract for SMS capacity, and in turn may rely on that capacity and\npurchase energy when their own generation becomes unavailable. 132 SMS customers may not\nresell any power taken under the SMS tariff. Furthermore, unlike the SMS tariff, there is no\nrequirement that CGS customers own their own generation, and many will not. 133\nConsequently, many potential CGS customers would not be eligible to participate in the CGS\ntariff if the SMS tariff were read into the CGS requirements. CGS and SMS customers are not\nindistinguishable.\n\n\n       Next, ETI argues that the energy rate charged to CGS customers and under the SMS tariff\nis based on the avoided costs determined after the fact for SMS. 134 ETI explains that, if the SMS\nrate were the recourse rate under CGS, the CGS customer would have no certainty before the\nfact of its risk exposure for a failure of the QF to put energy to ETI. This would complicate the\nCGS customers' ability to mitigate that risk. That said, there is little risk to address because the\nenergy rates are effectively the same for CGS service and SMS. TIEC's proposal seriously\nundermines its assertions that CGS customers and QFs could effectively firm up QF put energy\n\n\n       130   ETI Ex. 52 at 45-46.\n       131   TIEC Ex. 1 at 44.\n       132   Tr. at 124; ETI Ex. 73 at 17.\n       133   ETI Ex. 73 at 17-18.\n       134   The SMS tariff provides for an avoided cost rate plus an adder.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

There is little incentive for a CGS customer to\npay a premium for delivery assurance if the customer will pay approximately the same energy\nrate for CGS supply as it would pay for the energy that the Company provides when that\ncustomer's QF supply option is unavailable. The CGS customer would be relatively indifferent\nto the source of energy supply. TIEC's proposal for replacing Unserved Energy with the SMS\nrate is flawed as it does nothing more than offer the CGS customer neutral pricing options in lieu\nof alternative supply options.\n\n\n       TIEC and OPUC expressed the concern that the Unserved Energy rate will allow the\nCompany to realize additional profit. 135 ETI responds that any revenues obtained through\napplication of the Company's Unserved Energy component will be returned to all customers\nthrough the Company's fixed fuel factor (including LIPS customers as to the portion of load not\ndesignated for CGS service) as a credit to the fuel balance. 136\n\n\n       Finally, ETI argues that under TlEC's proposal, QF put would be deemed avoided\ncapacity for MSS-I purposes, purchased by ETI at its avoided capacity costs, and then purchased\nfrom ETI by CGS customers at avoided energy costs. In other words, the QF put would be\nrecognized as avoided capacity when doing so would result in MSS-l savings, but then priced as\navoided energy when it comes time for CGS customers to purchase such put from ETI.            The\nALJ agrees that TIEC's proposal on Unserved Energy should be rejected.\n\n\n                                             VI. CONCLUSION\n\n\n       PURA § 39.452(b) authorizes the Commission to accept, reject, or modify the\nCompany's proposed CGS tariff. The ALJ finds that ETl's proposal represents a good faith\neffort to develop a CGS program that does not violate the System Agreement and yet complies\nwith PURA § 39.452(b). The ALJ recommends the Commission reject the proposal, however,\nbecause it shifts a significant cost burden to ratepayers who either cannot or elect not to\nparticipate.

Furthermore, the costs cannot be accurately quantified\nuntil the program has been implemented and the number of participants known - thus\nnecessitating two cost-recovery riders and an annual true-up.        ETl recognizes the policy\nimplications of such cost-shifting and made this appeal to the Commission:\n\n       ETI realizes that the cost shifting associated with the CGS program raises\n       important policy concerns. If such concerns cause the Commission to conclude\n       that the CGS program as proposed should not be adopted, the proper course of\n       action is to reject the program as allowed by the statute, rather than modify the\n       program in a way that would require shareholders to fund unrecovered costs. 138\n\nThe ALJ agrees and recommends that ETl's proposed CGS program be rejected. The proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are limited to the CGS issue as the parties have already\nprovided the remaining proposed findings and conclusions in the Stipulation and Settlement\nAgreement and Proposed Final Order.\n\n\n             VII. PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n\nA.     Findings of Fact on ETl's CGS Proposal\n\n\n1.     As part of its application, ETl proposed a Competitive Generation Service (CGS)\n       pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. (PURA) § 39.452(b).\n\n2.     On July 16, 2010 and July 20, 2010, a SOAR Administrative Law Judge held a hearing\n       on the merits on ETl's CGS Proposal.\n\n3.     ETl's proposed CGS tariff provides eligible customers with the opportunity to have ETI\n       purchase competitive generation selected by the CGS customer and provide the selected\n       generation at retail to the CGS customer.\n\n4.     The eligible customers are Large Industrial Power Service (LIPS) customers under the\n       proposal.\n\n5.    Under the proposed tariff, a CGS customer would have the ability to contract with a\n      participating CGS supplier, an eligible Qualifying Facility (QF), that puts energy to ETl\n      for a set amount of load at an agreed upon price.\n\n       137\n                  PURA § 39.452(b).\n      138    ETl Initial Brief at 9.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO. XXX-XX-XXXX                PROPOSAL FOR DECISION                      PAGE 43\nPUC DOCKET NO. 37744\n\n\n\n6.    The CGS customer must designate what portion of its load will be served by its CGS\n      supplier under the CGS tariff and what portion will be served under the applicable LIPS\n      tariff rate.\n\n7.    So long as the CGS supplier provides the energy contracted for by the CGS buyer, BTl\n      will continue to purchase energy from the QF at the avoided cost rate and the CGS\n      customer will pay BTl the avoided cost rate for the level contracted for in place of all\n      generation relate~ components that would otherwise be billed under the LIPS tariff.\n\n8.    A CGS customer and a QF supplier are free to contract, without ETl's participation, for a\n      price other than avoided costs, in which case, the costs above or below the avoided costs\n      would be accounted for in payments between the CGS customer and CGS supplier, as\n      prescribed by the contract.\n\n9.     The proposed tariff would consist of a schedule describing the provisions of the program\n       (Schedule CGS) along with two cost recovery riders associated with the proposed\n       program: the Competitive Generation Service Cost rider (Rider CGSC) and the\n       Competitive Generation Service Unrecovered Service Cost rider (Rider CGSUSC).\n\n10.    Rider CGSC is designed to recover costs related to implementation and operating costs\n       incurred to support the CGS program. These costs would be recovered from all CGS\n       eligible customers (LIPS) customers through Rider CGSC regardless of whether they\n       actually take the CGS service.\n\n11.    Rider CGSC would recover ETl's initial and ongoing program costs from ratepayers who\n       would not cause those costs to be incurred.\n\n12.    Rider CGSC would recover costs from ratepayers who do not participate in the CGS\n       program.\n\n13.    The amount of implementation and operating costs incurred to support the CGS program\n       to be recovered through Rider CGSC cannot be ascertained until after the program is\n       implemented and CGS customers participate.\n\n14.    Rider CGSUSC is designed to recover the difference between what would have been\n       billed by BTl under traditional LIPS service and what is billed under the combined CGS\n       tariff and modified LIPS service.\n\n15.    The amount of unrecovered embedded generation costs and any other related base rate\n       costs to be recovered under Rider CGSUSC cannot be ascertained until after the program\n       is implemented and CGS customers participate in the program.\n\n16.    Rider CGSUSC would recover embedded generation costs and any other related base. rate\n       costs and would apply to all non-participating customers across all classes, including\n       LIPS customers not participating in the CGS program.\n\fSOAR DOCKET NO.

Rider CGSUSC would recover ETl's unrecovered embedded generation costs from\n      ratepayers who would not cause those costs to be incurred.\n\n18.   Rider CGSUSC would recover costs from ratepayers who do not participate in the CGS\n      program.\n\n19.   Rider CGSC and Rider CGSUSC may harm the competitiveness of manufacturers that\n      choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.\n\n20.   The power put to ETl would have no effect on ETl's generation resource planning\n      because the energy put to ETl by a QF is a non-firm resource.\n\n21.   There has not been a quantification of the alleged benefits to non-CGS customers that\n      would result from potential capacity savings, reduced average fuel costs, and additional\n      revenues from the Unserved Energy Rate.\n\n22.   Rider CGSUSC is deficient because it does not account for potential load growth. Load\n      growth should be accounted for because load growth could mitigate ETl's unrecovered\n      generation related costs.\n\n\nB.    Conclusions of Law on ETl's CGS Proposal\n\n\n1.    PURA § 39.452(b) permits ETl to charge its unrecovered initial and ongoing program\n      costs and generation related costs to customers who do not participate in the CGS\n      program.\n\n2.    ETl cannot be required to absorb its unrecovered costs under PURA § 39.452(b).\n\n3.    PURA § 39.452(b) does not prohibit ETl from charging CGS participants its unrecovered\n      costs.\n\n4.    PURA § 39.452(b) requires that the Commission \"approve, reject, or modify\" the CGS\n      tariff proposed by BTL\n\n5.    PURA § 39.452(b) permits ETl to account for load growth in the design of the CGS\n      tariff.\n\n6.    ETl has not met its burden of proof to establish a rate regarding the unrecovered cost of\n      implementing the CGS program.\n\n7.    The term \"eligible customer\" in PURA § 39.452(b) does not mandate that the CGS\n      program be only available to LIPS class customers.\n\n8.    P.U.C. SUBST.

AVAILABILITY\n\n                 Pursuant to PURA Section 39.452(b), this competitive generation tariff allows eligible\n                 Entergy Texas, Inc. (\"ETI\" or \"Company\") customers the ability to contract for competitive\n                 generation. This Rider will be available to Rate Schedules Large Industrial Power Service\n                 (\"LIPS\") and Large Industrial Power Service - Time of Day (\"LIPS-TOD\") firm customer\n                 load.\n\n          II.    APPLICABILITY\n\n                 Customers receiving service under Rate Schedules LIPS and LIPS-TOD may contract with           N\n                 Qualifying Facilities (\"QF(sn that are able to put energy to ETI for the provision of energy\n                 to serve all or part of the Customer's generation requirements. Such customers will pay\n                 only CGS charges on Schedule LIPS or Schedule LIPS-TOD (Net Monthly Bill, Column B)\n(                plus applicable adjustments for the load served on CGS. Eligible Customers who elect to\n                 serve a portion of their load with CGS are CGS Customers.\n\n          Ill.   REQUIREMENTS\n\n                 A. Any Customer applying for CGS must receive service under one of the Rate Schedules\n                    listed in § II above. Only the service provided under such Schedules is eligible for\n                    CGS.\n                 B. A LIPS customer participating in the CGS program as a QF at one account location\n                    may not also participate as a CGS customer at that same account location.\n                 C. CGS Customers must inform the Company at the time of sign-up of their MW block\n                    commitment for CGS for the initial term.         CGS Customers may change that\n                    commitment with their next term of service.\n                 D. Any Customer accepted for CGS service must be billed on a calendar month basis.\n                 E. CGS service may only begin after technical and contractual requirements are met\n                    (amended contract with the utility and back up metering/telemetry in place).\n                 F. Standby and Maintenance Service (\"SMS\") is not available to CGS Customers.\n\n\n          IV.    INITIAL TERM\n\n                 The initial term will begin January 1, 2011 and be effective for one year. CGS Customers\n                 must notify ETI in writing a minimum of 60 days before beginning CGS and must have all\n                 contractual and technical requirements completed prior to taking CGS. CGS Customers\n                 may start service anytime after January 1, 2011 but must commit to a full one year period\n                 from their beginning date. CGS may then be renewed on an annual basis with the\n                 minimum 60 day notification period. After the initial term, ETI will provide a report to the\n                 Public Utility Commission of Texas identifying the successes as well as issues raised by\n\n\n\n                                              (Continued on reverse side)\n\n\n\n\n    2009 ETI Rate Case                                                                          3-333\n\f                                                                                        Exhibit PRM-1\n                                                                                   2009 TX Rate Case\n                                                                                          Page 2 of7\n\n                                                                                            Page42.2\n            CGS. The report will also identify any changes that should be considered as a result of the\n            first year of implementation and may result in changes to this Rider. CGS Customers\n            assume the risk that changes to this Rider may affect the economics of any contract\n            between a CGS Customer and a QF.\n\n      V.    RETURN TO BUNDLED SERVICE\n\n            CGS Customers may choose to withdraw from their one year commitment to CGS at\n            anytime during that year but must give a 60 day written notice prior to returning to bundled\n            service. A CGS Customer choosing to withdraw may not return to CGS for at least 12\n            months from the time the withdrawal is effective.\n                                                                                                           N\n      VI.   NET MONTHLY BILL\n\n            CGS customers will be billed for CGS pursuant to § II. In addition to these charges CGS\n            Customers will also be billed the Company's Hourly Avoided Cost calculated pursuant to\n            Attachment A of Rate Schedule LQF paid to the QF(s) to provide the CGS Customer's\n            energy. Should any hourly deficiencies occur between the Customer's committed CGS\n            load and the QF generation delivery within that hour, CGS Customers will be billed for\n            \"Unserved CGS Energy'' and be charged using the formula below:\n\n            Gas price based on a 13,000 Btu/kWh heat rate (on-peak) and 10,000 Btu/kWh heat rate\n            (off-peak) applied to a gas price pursuant to the Houston Ship Channel Gas Daily Average\n            (HSCGDA) plus a delivery adder based on Entergy's historical average cost per MMBtu of\n            gas delivered to ETl's Lewis Creek and Sabine plants for the preceding 24 months ending\n            October 31. The delivery adder will be updated annually. On-peak and off-peak are as\n            defined by Platt's Megwatt Daily.\n\n      IX.   METERING\n\n            Interval data recording (IDR) meters and telemetry are required for billing CGS accounts.\n            Back up meters, the incremental cost of which will be paid by the Customer, are also\n            required. The CGS Customer will be responsible for the cost of telephone service and\n            maintaining any required telephone equipment for the IDR. Alternatively, and at ETl's\n            discretion, such telemetry communications service required for billing may be provided to\n            the CGS Customer in accordance with ETI Rider Schedule RCL (Remote Communications\n            Link Rider).

PURPOSE\n\n                   This Competitive Generation Service Unrecovered Service Cost Rider rRider CGSUSC\"\n                   or \"Rider\") defines the procedure by which Entergy Texas, Inc. (\"Company\") shall\n                   implement and adjust rates for recovery of lost base rate revenue resulting from\n                   customers participating in the Company's Competitive Generation Service (\"CGS\n                   Program\"). The purpose of this Rider is to provide a mechanism for recovery of such lost\n                   base rate revenues that were included in the Company's last general rate case\n                   proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Texas (\"PUCr).\n                                                                                                                N\n          II.      APPLICABILITY\n\n                   This Rider is applicable under the regular terms and conditions of the Company to all\n                   electric service billed under the Company's rate schedules subject to the jurisdiction of\n                   the PUCT, with the exception of service billed under the CGS Program provisions of Rate\n                   Schedules LIPS and UPS-TOD.\n\n          Ill.     RATE PROCEDURE\n\n                   The rates shown on Attachment A to this Rider shall be updated annually on or before\n                   October 1st to reflect the estimated lost base rate revenue for (1) customers and load\n                   participating in the Company's CGS Program in the upcoming calendar year and (2) a\n                   true-up calculation for the twelve (12) billing months ending with December 31st of the\n                   prior year. The estimate of the tost base rate revenue for the upcoming calendar year will\n                   be based on the usage history for the known participants at the time of filing. The\n                   Company will calculate the base rate charges that would apply under the standard rates\n                   for the annual usage of customers participating in the CGS Program. This standard rate\n                   amount will be compared to the rate revenue calculated under the applicable CGS\n                   Program rates actually in effect for the Program participants. The difference between\n                   these two amounts is the CGS Program's annual estimated lost base rate revenue.\n\n                   The true-up calculation is the difference between the calculated standard (non-CGS\n                   Program) rate charges for actual usage in the CGS Program and the actual CGS\n                   Program rate revenue for all participants in the twelve {12) billing months ending with\n                   December 31stof the prior year, plus interest calculated monthly on accrued true-up\n                   balances using the rate established annually by the PUCT for overbilling and certain\n                   underbilling in the P.U.C. Suesr. R. 25.28(c) and (d). Interest shall be calculated based\n                   on the principles set out in the P.U.C. Suesr. R. 25.236(e){1 ). The sum of the upcoming\n                   year estimate and the true-up calculation is the amount allocated to the rate classes\n                   using the Production Demand Allocation Factors from the most recent base-rate case\n                   adjusted to remove CGS Program load and energy. The resulting rate class allocations\n                   of lost base rate revenue will be used to calculate rate class charges using the\n\n\n                                              (Continued on reverse side)\n\n\n\n\n    2009 ETI Rate Case                                                                          3-337\n\f                                                                                           Exhibit PRM-1\n                                                                                      2009 TX Rate Case\n                                                                                             Page 6 of7\n\n                                                                                       Page44.2\n             Company's best estimate of Mure billing determinants as adjusted to remove expected\n             CGS Program load and energy.\n\n             The initial Rider CGSUSC Rate Adjustments shall become effective with the first (1st)\n             billing cycle of the month following the date of the PUCT order approving this Rider\n             CGSUSC if such order is received by the fifth (5th) day of the month, otherwise, the initial\n             Rider CGSUSC Rate Adjustments shall become effective with the first (1st) billing cycle\n             of the second (2nd) subsequent month after the date of the PUCT order approving this\n             Rider CGSUSC and shall remain in effect until superseded.

MACK:\n\n 3          Q      How are you doing, Mr. May?\n\n 4          A      Doing good.\n\n 5          Q      Good.   Could you tell me what an interval\n\n 6   data recording meter is?\n\n 7          A       It's a meter that records the actual usage by\n\n 8   a customer and frequent intervals, perhaps as frequent\n\n 9   as you want, 15-minute intervals, that sort of thing,\n\n10   so it provides for an average month.          Instead of just\n\n11   cumulative consumption,        it would provide that actual\n\n12   consumption on a 15-minute basis.\n\n13          Q      And you claim that those would be necessary\n\n14   for a CGS customer.         Is that right?\n\n15          A       Correct.\n\n16          Q      And why is that?\n\n17          A       So that you can match up what the actual QF\n\n18   Put is to what the consumption is at that CGS\n\n19   customer.       And so that -- make sure that the unserved\n\n20   energy that Mr. Hurstell was talking about, that would\n\n21   provide whether or not there was a need to provide the\n\n22   gap,       if you will, with unserved energy.\n\n23          Q      Okay.   And is that kilowatts, or kilowatt\n\n24   hours?\n\n25          A       It would be kilowatts per hour.    Probably\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 l~b\n\n\n               PUC: 37744 SOAR: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                VOLUME 3\n\n 1   match it up on an hourly basis.\n\n 2       Q     Okay.     And if there were a customer that had\n\n 3   a permanent and steady load, would they still need one\n\n 4   of these meters?\n\n 5       A     Absolutely.\n\n 6       Q     And why is that?\n\n 7       A     Because I don't think there is a permanent\n\n 8   steady load.      That load would fluctuate, and we would\n\n 9   need to make sure we know exactly what that load is\n\n10   and can match it up on an hour-by-hour basis with that\n\n11   QF Put.\n\n12       Q     Okay.\n\n13                     MR.

KELLEY:\n\n17       Q     Yes, I have a few questions, Mr. May.\n\n18       A     All right.\n\n19       Q     Since this legislation was being considered\n\n20   sometime, I would imagine, before the last legislative\n\n21   session up until today, what discussions has the\n\n22   company had with any of its LIPS customers to gauge\n\n23   the level of interest in the CGS program?\n\n24       A     What discussion have we had with our LIPS\n\n25   customers?\n\n                    KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAR: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1         Q    Right.\n\n 2         A    We had a couple of discussions, and I won't\n\n 3   be able to recall all the details.          There were -- I\n\n 4   believe there were at least two.\n\n 5                      The one that I am thinking of\n\n 6   specifically here, where we talked about some of the\n\n 7   issues associated, that was about a year ago.          It was\n\n 8   after the legislative session.       We talked about some\n\n 9   of the provisions of the CGS within the law.          We\n\n10   described what we saw as some of the challenges of\n\n11   making sure that the CGS complied with the system\n\n12   agreement.       And as a matter of fact,    in that meeting,\n\n13   one of those LIPS customers suggested using QF as a\n\n14   means for getting around that.\n\n15         Q    As a percentage of your LIPS customers, did\n\n16   you       have you come away from any of these\n\n17   discussions with a feel for what the level of\n\n18   participation would be?\n\n19         A    No.     And having that discussion, I think\n\n20   there was indication of interest, but, you know, it's\n\n21   one of those things where it's all in the details and\n\n22   relevant marketing conditions at the time and so\n\n23   forth.     So I could not tell you how -- which customers\n\n24   and how many and how much would be interested in\n\n25   actually partaking in the CGS.\n\n                       KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                 512.474.2233\n\f                                                                 1~8\n\n              PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                               VOLUME 3\n\n 1       Q    Okay.     Just no idea if it would be 5 percent\n\n 2   of your customers or 100 percent of your customers?\n\n 3       A    Have no way of estimating it.\n\n 4       Q    Okay.     If you could turn to Page 15 of\n\n 5   your -- oh, 19 of your testimony --\n\n 6       A    Direct?\n\n 7       Q     -- sir, and you talk about the CGSC Rider and\n\n 8   what the company estimates for startup and ongoing\n\n 9   costs.\n\n10       A    Yes, ma'am.\n\n11       Q    And I notice on Lines No. 15 and 16, you talk\n\n12   about that the precise level of ongoing cost in each\n\n13   of these areas would be dependent upon level of\n\n14   participation.     Correct?\n\n15       A    Yes, ma'am.\n\n16       Q    But what did -- what level of participation\n\n17   did you use to come up with the estimates for the\n\n18   kick-off costs and the yearly cost?\n\n19       A    I think what we talked about is a level that\n\n20   was well below the entirety of the LIPS class but at a\n\n21   level that could be managed with sort of an\n\n22   out-of-the-process process.     We have a billing process\n\n23   that is fairly automated.     What we would plan to do\n\n24   with this would be to do these by hand, so to speak,\n\n25   and it was our view that we could manage a significant\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1   participation in this with these two-and-a-half\n 2   full-time customers on an ongoing basis.         So a\n 3   significant portion of the customers could be managed\n 4   with that.\n 5          Q    Okay.    But you must have had some starting\n 6   estimate.     I think I heard you say you were trying to\n 7   come up with a ballpark or          there must -- it's not\n\n 8   plucked out of thin air.        You grant me that, don't\n 9   you?\n10          A    I'm sorry.     I didn't hear all that.\n11          Q    The $610,000 figure and then the 330\n12          A    Yes, ma'am.\n\n13          Q    -- that's not just plucked out of thin air.\n14   Correct?\n15          A    No, ma'am.\n16          Q    Okay.    So what -- I think I heard you say\n17   that there was some assumption about the level of\n18   participation there would be, and I'd ask you to kind\n19   of give me a ballpark there.\n\n20          A    Yes.    And let me make clear, I don't think we\n21   had any assumption of what the actually participation\n22   would be.     What we were doing was trying to design a\n23   system in which we would have the capacity to deal\n24   with a significant portion of the LIPS customers\n25   participating.\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                                                                  .LbU\n\n                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1          Q   And what do you consider to be a significant\n 2   portion to be?\n 3          A   More than half.\n 4          Q   Okay.     I think a moment ago, you qualified\n 5   the figure of -- that appears on Page 14, the\n 6   75.2 million?\n 7          A   Yes, ma'am.\n\n 8          Q   You said that the -- a settlement would\n 9   impact that?\n10          A   Yes, ma'am.\n11          Q   How do you anticipate it would impact it?\n12          A   I can't estimate that with any certainty at\n13   this time, but it would be a smaller number than\n14   that\n15          Q   Okay.\n\n16          A    -- were the settlement to be adopted.\n17          Q   Okay.\n18                      MS.

GRIFFITHS:\n\n 3       Q    Okay.    Mr. May, the $75.2 million figure on\n\n 4   Page 14 of your testimony, that is based on the\n\n 5   coincident peak demand of the LIPS accounts for the\n\n 6   test year ending June 30th, 2009.      Is that correct?\n\n 7       A    I think it's actually billing determinants,\n\n B   is what that's based upon.\n\n 9       Q    Okay.    Could you take a look at your\n\n10   testimony starting on Page 13 and then looking at that\n\n11   next Q and A on Page 14?\n\n12       A     (Witness complying.)\n\n13       Q    And you estimate that the coincident peak\n\n14   demand of the LIPS class is approximately\n\n15   651 megawatts.    Correct?\n\n16       A    Yes.\n\n17       Q    All right.     You don't anticipate that all\n\n18   651 megawatts would move to the CGS load, do you?\n\n19       A    I don't have a way to estimate how much\n\n20   would.\n\n21       Q    So the answer is no?\n22       A     I have no way of estimating it.\n\n23       Q    And the generation portion of the LIPS\n\n24   revenue requirement you state is 75.2 million.        That\n\n25   is the entire -- based on the entire LIPS billing\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                                       16~\n\n                PUC: 37744 SOAR: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/16/2010\n                                 VOLUME 3\n\n 1   determinants.        Correct?\n 2       A       Yes, ma'am.     We know with certainty what the\n 3   actual unit cost of the difference between LIPS and\n 4   CGS is.    We just don't know what volume to apply to\n 5   that.     We'll know that through participation in the\n 6   program.\n 7       Q      All right.      So you don't know those costs\n 8   now, and you can't measure --\n 9       A       No.\n10       Q             them at this point?\n11       A      We know those costs with certainty.         We don't\n12   know what the volume would be applied to those costs.\n13       Q       Okay.     If you could turn to your exhibits\n14   that contain the competitive generation services\n15   unrecovered service cost rider.\n16       A       Yes, ma'am.\n17       Q      And that is          I'm referring you to Page 7.\n18   Correct -- or I'm sorry            to Page 7.   And I think the\n19   Bates number at the bottom is 3-339?\n20       A       Yes, ma'am.\n21       Q      All right.      You're not actually proposing any\n22   rate adjustment specifically in this tariff, are you?\n23       A       No.     There's no volume that is estimated at\n24   this time to apply to that tariff, so there is no\n25   number in there.\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                        SOAH DOCKET NO.

And so you propose that the\n 4   unserved energy rate be provided in the same manner as\n 5   stand-by service is provided to customers who own\n 6   their own generation.     Is that right?\n 7       A    Right.    Given that they're essentially the\n 8   same type of service, I didn't feel that there was a\n 9   need to discriminate against the CGS customer.\n10       Q    And that's rate schedule SMS.      Correct?\n11       A    Yes.\n12       Q    That's a cost-based rate.     Would you agree?\n13       A     It's more or less a cost-based rate, yes.\n14       Q    And that SMS rate includes a demand charge.\n15   Right?\n16       A    Yes.\n17       Q    And just to clarify, you're agreeing that if\n18   the SMS rate is utilized for unserved energy, that CGS\n19   customers would indeed pay that demand charge as well?\n20       A    Yes, they would.\n21       Q    Are you familiar with fuel cost recovery in\n22   Texas, sir?\n23       A    Yes.\n24       Q    Earlier I believe you heard some questions of\n25   Mr. Nalepa about whether or not the avoided costs that\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                                ~bl\n\n             PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                              VOLUME 4\n\n 1   a CGS customer might pay would be above or below the\n 2   average cost to customers --\n 3       A       Yes.\n 4       Q       -- non-CGS customers?\n 5       A       I heard the questions, yes.\n 6       Q       And do you know whether the effects of\n 7   whether or not the avoided cost that is above or below\n 8   the average fuel cost charge to CGS customers will\n 9   flow through the fuel rate?\n10       A       Well, the costs that the CGS customers are\n\n11   charged might not be reflected in the fuel rate, but\n12   to the extent that the CGS customer is taking 24/7\n\n13   power off of the system -- and that's basically taking\n14   it away from Entergy Texas generation purchased power\n15   supply -- that will have an effect on the cost flowed\n16   through the Texas fuel factor.\n\n17       Q       Right .   Let's talk a little bit about cost\n18   recovery.     Do you agree that ETI will in fact incur\n19   costs to set up and administer the CGS program?\n\n20       A       Yes.\n21       Q       And do you agree that if a LIPS customer\n22   decides to switch to CGS service that ETI will not\n23   collect the fixed production cost included in the LIPS\n24   rate from that customer?\n\n25       A       I think the fact that the customer has\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC .\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                 VOLUME 4\n\n 1   switched and the Company is not collecting the same\n 2   revenue certainly creates the potential that some\n 3   costs would be uncollected\n 4       Q      All right.\n 5       A       -- unrecovered.\n 6       Q      And that cost will go unrecovered unless\n 7   there is some additional revenues to --\n 8       A      Exactly, unless there are some additional\n 9   benefits to offset those unrecovered costs .       That's\n10   correct.\n11       Q       I think earlier in your testimony in this\n12   section you quote the statute, 39.452(b) at Page 36.\n13   Let me know when you're there.\n14                    MS. GRIFFITHS:    What page are you on?\n15                    MR. BREEDVELD:     Page 36.\n16                    MS. FERRIS:     Is that of his direct?\n17                    MR. BREEDVELD:    Yes, I'm sorry, direct\n18   testimony.\n19       Q       (BY MR. BREEDVELD)    Okay.   About a third of\n20   the way down, sir, do you see where the statute says\n21   that the utility's rates shall be set in this\n22   proceeding in which the tariff is adopted to recover\n23   any costs that are unrecovered as a result of the\n24   implementation tariff?\n25       A      Yes, it states that.\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                                                                34~\n\n              PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                               VOLUME 4\n\n 1       A    Based on the adjusted test-year, yes.\n 2       Q    And the rate-setting process that we are\n 3   describing does not concern itself about what may\n 4   occur after rates are set.     Right?   At least at that\n 5   time?\n 6       A    That's correct.     The assumption is   that~\n\n 7   reasonable revenue level has been set prospectively\n a   and that the conditions may change up or down, and it\n\n 9   may be different in the future.\n\n10       Q    And you agree that when you set rates, the\n11   company should have the opportunity to recover the\n12   revenue requirement that those rates are based on.\n13   Right?\n14       A    The cost of service rates are set at a level\n15   that the commission has determined will produce a\n16   reasonable opportunity to recover cost.      Whether or\n17   not it does or does not is within the range of\n18   conditions that may exist in the future and, of\n19   course, the company can always file another case if,\n\n20   in fact, revenues no longer cover cost.\n21       Q    I think we are not disagreeing.      I think I\n22   said you would agree that the company should have the\n23   opportunity to recover the revenue requirement or the\n24   cost that rates are based on.     Right?\n25       A    What I said is the commission determined when\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                                  3~0\n\n                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                 VOLUME 4\n\n 1   it set the rates in the rate case, that would provide\n 2   a reasonable opportunity to recover cost of service.\n\n 3       Q      And the CGS program should not impede that\n 4   opportunity to recover those costs as established in\n\n 5   that adjusted test-year.     Correct?\n 6       A       I would say in an ideal world, yes, that's\n 7   correct.\n 8       Q      And the costs that may go unrecovered due to\n 9   the CGS program, they are reflected as part of the\n\n10   overall embedded costs in the test-year -- right --\n11   that the rates are set on?\n12       A      There were costs allocated to the CGS\n13   customers and to their class.      So in that sense, yes.\n14   After the rates are set, there really is no attempt to\n15   track particular components to particular --\n16   particular cost components to particular customers.\n17       Q      But those costs are not incremental costs by\n18   any means.     Right?   Costs that are -- for example, the\n19   LIPS embedded cost of service in the test-year has\n20   nothing to do with incremental cost that may be\n21   incurred after the rates are set.       Right?    They are\n22   costs that are in the test-year -- embedded historical\n23   costs.     Right?\n24       A      Embedded costs for allocated LIPS, they were\n25   part of the overall cost of service that the\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                              512.474.2233\n\f              PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                               VOLUME 4\n\n 1   commission approves in the rate case.\n 2       Q     If you set aside the CGS program for a\n 3   minute, once rates are set, typically revenues can\n 4   change, the cost can change as well.      Correct?\n s       A     That's correct.\n 6       Q    And if you set aside the CGS program for a\n 7   minute, if the company had increased revenues, those\n 8   increased revenues could be applied to off set or\n 9   recover increased cost.     They are not reflected in the\n10   test-year.     Right?\n11       A     Yes, that's possible.    I mean --\n12       Q     That's typically how a rate setting has\n13   worked -- base rate setting has worked at the\n14   commission .    Right?\n\n15       A     Well, the revenues are not normally dedicated\n16   to particular uses, but certainly as costs increase,\n17   the company will use the revenues to cover changes and\n18   conditions that occur after the test-year.\n\n19       Q     So you are asking that the revenues -- the\n20   sales growth revenues, any of the company realizes, be\n21   dedicated to off set embedded costs that are in the\n22   historical test-year -- right -- that may be foregone\n23   because of the CGS program?\n24       A     Yes, that's correct.\n25       Q     And to the extent you do that -- to the\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                   VOLUME 4\n\n 1   extent there is revenue growth, it won't be available\n 2   to cover other cost increases that may occur after the\n 3   rates are set.     Correct?\n 4       A      That's possible.      It could -- as I said, it\n 5   could affect the extent to which the company may\n 6   accelerate its need for a rate case in the future.\n 7                    MR.

WILLIAMS:\n\n 9         Q     Hi Mr. Mendoza.\n10         A     Hi.\n11         Q     Under the CGS program, as you understand it,\n12   Mr. Mendoza, the company buys from QFs that avoided\n13   cost.     Right?\n14         A     Yes, sir, that's correct.\n15         Q     So long as QF put is made available, the\n16   company collects no more from CGS customers in that\n17   same avoided cost.        Right?\n\n18         A     Yes, sir, that's correct.\n\n19         Q     So there is nothing in it for the company\n20   regarding the purchase of avoided cost -- right -- in\n21   terms of prof it or margin?\n22         A     It's a simple pass-through as I understand\n23   it.\n24                      THE REPORTER:     Can you speak up, please.\n25                      WITNESS MENDOZA:     Yes.\n\n                        KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                                  512.474.2233\n\f                PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                                 VOLUME 4\n\n 1                    THE REPORTER:    I didn't get your last\n 2   answer.\n\n 3       A       It's a simple pass-through.\n 4       Q       (BY MR. WILLIAMS)    And you also understand,\n s   do you not, that if the QF put is not available, if\n 6   the company has to provide what's called unserved\n 7   energy, then under that tariff, the customers get any\n 8   margins from those sales -- float through them through\n 9   the fuel clause .      Do you understand that as well?\n10       A      Yes, sir.\n11       Q       So again, there is no opportunity for the\n12   company to make a prof it or a windfall off that aspect\n13   of the program either .      Right?\n14       A      Not the way I understand it, no.\n15       Q       Is part of your recommendation that the\n16   commission consider getting -- taking base rate\n17   revenues associated with load growth to recoup\n18   unrecovered cost associated with the CGS program.          Is\n19   that right?\n\n20       A      Yes, sir, that's correct.\n21       Q      More generally, is it Staff's position that\n22   the proposed CGS program should be rejected because\n23   it's not consistent with traditional rate-making\n24   principles.     Is that sort of a summary of your\n25   concern?\n\n                     KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                               512.474.2233\n\f             PUC: 37744 SOAH: XXX-XX-XXXX HOM 7/20/2010\n                              VOLUME 4\n\n 1       A    That could be one way to look at it.\n\n 2       Q    And as we talked about with Mr. Johnson, both\n 3   principles include that rates are supposed to be\n 4   designed to recover adjusted test-year cost.        Right?\n\n 5       A    Under a rate case?\n\n 6       Q    Yes .\n\n 7       A    Yes, that's correct.\n\n 8       Q    And traditional rate setting does not concern\n 9   itself with incremental costs from revenues that occur\n10   after the period addressed in the rate case.        Right?\n\n11       A    For base rates?\n\n12       Q    Yes, sir.\n13       A    For base rates, yes.\n\n14       Q    And it would be completely improper here if\n15   you would have not, for example, set rates at a level\n\n16   below that is shown by the test-year in the hope that\n17   some later incremental revenue might make up the\n\n18   difference.

Introduction\n            This interim order addresses the Commission's decision regarding three threshold issues\nsurrounding Entergy Texas, Inc.'s ( ETI's) proposed competitive generation service (CGS). The\n\nCommission makes its determination on these three threshold issues so the parties can move\nforward with the remaining issues that parties have characterized as being contingent on\nCommission decisions on the threshold issues:           ( 1) what types of costs that will be considered\nunrecovered for purposes of PURA § 39.452(b); ( 2) what types of ETI customers will be eligible\n\nfor participation in the CGS program; and (3) which ETI customers will be responsible for\npaying the unrecovered costs.\n\n            ETI, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Industrial Energy\nConsumers, State Agencies, Kroger Co., Cities,' Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and Sam's East,\nInc. participated in this docket.\n\n\n\n                                       II.        Procedural History\n        ETI submitted its proposed CGS tariff and related riders in Docket No. 37744, its last rate\ncase.2 In that rate case, the parties settled on all issues except for ETI's CGS proposal. After a\nhearing on the CGS proposal and the associated riders, the administrative law judge (ALJ)\n\n        I\n           The cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Groves, Houston, Huntsville,\nMontgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches,\nRose City, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange.\n        zApplication of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs,\nDocket No. 37744, Corrected Application (Feb. 23, 2010).\n\n\n                                                                                                              e^  l\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                          000000001\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Interim Order                                    Page 2 of 17\n\n\n\nforwarded the parties' stipulation and settlement agreement and the proposal for decision to the\nCommission for consideration.\n\n        The Commission considered the settlement and the proposal for decision at the\nNovember 10 and December 1, 2010 open meetings. The Commission adopted the settlement\nfor the rate case issues and severed the CGS issues into this docket, including the record in\nDocket No. 37744.3\n\n        At the December 1, 2010 open meeting, the Commission requested the parties to enter\ninto negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined CGS program\nissues as possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\nthe Commission for consideration. Status reports were filed on January 13 and 28, February 18,\nMarch 11, and April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that\nthey were working to narrow the contested issues.\n\n        On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\na motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket.                     TIEC and\nCommission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion. At the\nSeptember 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and issued an\norder requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that have been\nsettled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could not be reached.\nThe parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent upon the Commission's\ndetermination of the unsettled issues.\n\n        On November 1, 2011, several parties4 filed an agreed list of settled issues. However, the\nparties did not agree on a recommendation as to how the unsettled issues and issues that are\ncontingent on the Commission's determination of unsettled issues should be addressed and\nresolved by the Commission. Therefore, TIEC also separately filed a list of unsettled issues and\nrequest for procedural schedule.      TIEC also requested that the Commission receive additional\nevidence in order to resolve the unrecovered costs issue because ETI's proposal in Docket\nNo. 37744 was based on ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and\n\n        3 Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs,\nDocket No. 37744, Order No. 14 Memorializing Decision Granting Motion to Sever ( Dec. 3, 2010).\n         ' Cities, Entergy, OPUC, Commission Staff, State Agencies, and Wal-Mart/Sam's East.

Many of the items are simply elements of larger\nprogram issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects essential to final resolution of that\nprogram issue. Items as to which agreement in principle exists are \"subject to satisfactory\nresolution of unsettled issues. ,6\n\n        On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                                      On\nFebruary 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\nFebruary 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.                       The\nparties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n        On April 13, 2012, the parties submitted an unopposed stipulation on the threshold issue\nregarding customers responsible for paying unrecovered costs. The parties, except ETI, agreed\nthat CGS customers would be the only ETI customers responsible for unrecovered costs of the\nCGS program. ETI did not join or oppose this stipulation.7                  On April 18, 2012, the parties\nsubmitted a third stipulation on customer eligibility stating that LIPS customers would be the\nCGS-eligible customers, with certain limitations on the LIPS customers' participation and other\nprogram minimums and caps.8\n\n\n\n\n       5 TIEC's Response to Joint Motion for Decision on Proposal for Decision at 4 (Sep. 15, 2011).\n       6 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts (Jan. 20, 2012).\n         Unopposed Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 3 (Apr. 13, 2012).\n         Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 2 (Apr. 18, 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                      000000003\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Interim Order                                    Page 4 of 17\n\n\n\n         The Commission held a hearing on the remaining contested threshold issue on\nApril 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                            III.     Discussion\n         PURA9 § 39.452(b) requires ETI to propose a CGS tariff that would require ETI to\npurchase CGS, selected by the CGS customer, and provide the generation at retail to the\ncustomer. ETI is required to provide and price retail transmission service, including necessary\nancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive\ngeneration tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the utility's cost of service.             Competitive\ngeneration customers are not to be considered wholesale transmission customers. The statute\nrequired the Commission to approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than\nSeptember 1, 2010. The CGS tariff may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates\nunder Section 36.007, and ETI's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is\nadopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff. The\nstatute requires the Commission to ensure that a competitive generation tariff not be\nimplemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers that\nchoose not to take advantage of competitive generation. PURA § 39.452(b) also prohibits the\nCommission from issuing a decision relating to the competitive generation tariff that is contrary\nto an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having\njurisdiction.\n\n         The Commission finds that the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements are\nreasonable and adopts them to the extent they do not conflict with other Commission\ndeterminations in this docket.\n\n         Adoption of the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements leaves one threshold issue\nremaining: the types of costs that will be considered ETI's unrecovered costs for purposes of\nPURA § 39.452(b). The Commission finds that unrecovered costs are only those costs necessary\nto implement and administer the CGS program and are not to be defined to include lost revenues,\nembedded generation costs, or any other types of costs.\n\n\n\n         ' Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), TEX.

Eligible Customers Stipulation\n        The Commission adopts the stipulation and settlement regarding eligible customers and\nfinds that LIPS customers are the ETI customers that will be eligible to participate in the CGS\nprogram (with further Iimitations as set forth in the parties' stipulation on this issue).10\n\n\n            B. Customers Responsible for Paying Unrecovered Costs Stipulation\n        The Commission also adopts the stipulation and settlement regarding determining which\ncustomers      will   be    responsible       for      paying   the   unrecovered   costs   referenced   in\nPURA § 39.452(b). To the extent there are costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of\n\nthe CGS program tariff, those costs will be borne solely by customers taking service under the\nCGS tarif£ \"\n\n\n             C. January 20, 2012 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\n        The Commission adopts the stipulated facts submitted by the parties on January 20, 2012\nregarding ETI's capacity deficit and the program cap and notes that the items that are a part of\nthe \"agreed settlement terms\" regarding eligible CGS suppliers, amount of CGS capacity, the\nCGS customer unbundled rate, the CGS energy payment, the CGS customer fixed-cost\ncontribution, the CGS customer unserved energy rate, and the recognition of CGS supply as firm\ncapacity are items for which there is only an agreement in principle that are subject to\nsatisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.12\n\n\n                                          D. Unrecovered Costs\n       The remaining threshold issue, the meaning of \"costs unrecovered as a result of\nimplementation of the CGS program tariff,\" as used in PURA § 39.452(b), was the subject of the\nApril 19, 2012 hearing. In the proposal for decision, the ALJ found that ETI is entitled to collect\nunrecovered embedded generation costs and any other related base rate costs as a result of\ncustomer migration to the CGS program.13\n\n\n\n\n       'o Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 2 (Apr. 18, 2012).\n\n       \" Unopposed Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 3 (Apr. 13, 2012).\n       'Z CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts at 1(Jan. 20, 2012).\n\n       \" Proposal for Decision at 22 (Oct. 5, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               000000005\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                              Interim Order                                      Page 6 of 17\n\n\n\n         ETI argued that unrecovered costs should be defined as the embedded production costs\nand any other related base rate costs that would have been recovered through traditional rates\ncharged to CGS customers that will no longer be recovered due to the CGS program.14 TIEC\ntook the position that unrecovered costs should not include ETI's hypothetical lost revenues and\nthat the costs that could be unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff should include\nthe expenditures actually incurred by ETI to implement and maintain the CGS program.ts Cities\nand OPUC agreed with TIEC that unrecovered costs are not the same thing as unrecovered\nrevenues. 16 Cities also noted that it would be unreasonable to allow ETI to continue to incur\ncosts for a customer the utility no longer plans to serve. 17\n\n        In making its determination of the definition of unrecovered costs, the Commission\nfollows the precedent set in CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC v.

Findings of Fact\n\nProcedural History\nI.       As part of its application in Docket No. 37744, Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for\n         Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, ETI proposed a competitive\n         generation service (CGS) program pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act. Tex. Util.\n         Code Ann. (PURA) § 39.452(b).\n\n2.       On July 16, 2010 and July 20, 2010, a State Office of Administrative Hearings\n         administrative law judge held a hearing on the merits on ETI's CGS proposal.\n\n3.       A proposal for decision was issued on November             1, 2010.   The ALJ ultimately\n         recommended that the CGS proposal be rejected.\n\n4.       The Commission considered the proposal for decision at the November 10 and\n         December 1, 2010 open meetings as part of Docket No. 37744. At the December 1, 2010\n         open meeting, the Commission adopted the settlement for the rate case issues and severed\n         the CGS proposal into this Docket. The Commission requested that the parties enter into\n         negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined issues as\n         possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\n         the Commission for consideration.\n\n5.       Order No. I was issued on December 3, 2010 severing the CGS issues into this docket,\n         including the record in Docket No. 37744.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       000000007\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Interim Order                                    Page 8 of 17\n\n\n6.      Sabine Cogen, LP filed a motion to intervene in this docket on December 23, 2010. ETI\n\n        tiled an objection to Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene on December 30, 2010.\n        Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene was denied in Order No. 3 on January 12, 2011.\n\n7.      ETI, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Industrial Energy\n        Consumers, State Agencies, Kroger Co., Cities,20 Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and\n        Sam's East, Inc., and Cottonwood Energy are parties to this proceeding.\n\n8.      On January 11, 2011, the Commission ALJ issued Order No. 2 requiring ETI to either\n        provide an update on the status of settlement discussions or to propose a schedule, agreed\n        to by all parties, for finalizing the outstanding issues.\n\n9.      The parties filed status reports on January 13 and 28, February 18, March 11, and\n        April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that they\n        thought that they could narrow the issues.\n\n10.     On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\n        a motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket. TIEC and\n        Commission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion.\n        At the September 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and\n        issued an order requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that\n        have been settled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could\n        not be reached. The parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent\n        upon the Commission's determination of the unsettled issues.\n\n11.     On November 1, several parties filed an agreed list of settled issues.                 TIEC also\n        separately filed a list of unsettled issues and request for procedural schedule. TIEC also\n        requested that the Commission receive additional evidence in order to resolve the\n        unrecovered costs issues because ETI's proposal in Docket No. 37744 was based on\n        ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and capacity-based program.\n        The circumstances had changed primarily due to the agreement of the Entergy Operating\n        to treat CGS power from qualifying facilities in the ETI service territory as firm\n\n\n        20 The cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Groves, Houston, Huntsville,\nMontgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches,\nRose City, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              000000008\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                         Interim Order                               Page 9 of 17\n\n\n\n       generation. The remainder of the parties tiled a joint agreed list of unsettled issues and\n       issues contingent on a Commission determination of unsettled issues.\n\n12.    At the December 8 and December 15, 2011 open meetings, the Commissioners decided\n       that the parties should submit stipulated facts, the Commission would re-open the record\n       to admit additional evidence as requested by TIEC, and then the Commission would\n       make a decision on the three threshold unsettled issues in an interim order.\n\n13.    On December 18, 2011, Order No. 4 was issued establishing a procedural schedule.\n\n14.    On January 20, 2012, the parties submitted agreed settlement terms and stipulated facts.\n       The parties reached agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within the\n       overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs.              Many of the items are simply\n       elements of larger program issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects\n       essential to final resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in\n       principle exists are \"subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.\"\n\n15.    On January 24, 2012, Order No. 5 was issued clarifying the number of copies of\n       testimony that were to be filed by the parties.\n\n16.    On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                         On\n       February 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\n       February 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.\n       The parties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n17.    Order No. 6 was issued on February 1, 2012 setting April 19, 2012 as the date for the\n       hearing.\n\n18.    On April 13, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation that to the extent there are\n       costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be\n       borne solely by customers taking service under the CGS tariff. ETI did not join but did\n       not oppose the stipulation.\n\n19.    On April 18, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation regarding customer\n       eligibility. LIPS customers will be eligible to participate in ETI's CGS program (with\n       further limitations as set forth in the stipulation on this issue).\n\n20.    The Commission held the hearing on the merits on April 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        000000009\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                        Interim Order                               Page 10 of 17\n\n\n\nElizible customers stipulation\n21.     The parties agreed that only customers eligible to take service under ETI's Large\n        Industrial Power Service ( LIPS) are eligible customers for the CGS program.\n\n22.     The parties agreed that only LIPS firm load will be eligible to participate in the CGS\n        program.\n\n23.     The parties agreed that LIPS customers with interruptible service (IS) or standby and\n        maintenance service (SMS) load are not precluded from participating in the CGS\n        program, but this participation is limited to their firm LIPS load.      To the extent that\n        customers with IS load participate in the CGS program, they must comply with the terms\n        of the IS tariffs regarding minimum LIPS load. Only the portion of the customer's LIPS\n        load that is in excess of the firm contract power minimum requirement under section 1 of\n        Schedule IS is eligible for the CGS program.\n\n24.     The parties agreed that to the extent there are increased administration costs associated\n        with billing a customer that has CGS and IS or SMS load, the CGS customer will bear the\n        costs.\n\n25.     The parties agreed that there will be a 115 MW cap on the CGS program.\n\n26.    The parties agreed that there will be a 5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\n27.    The parties agreed that there will be no aggregation of CGS customer load to meet the\n        5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\n28.    The parties agreed that there will be a cap of 10 CGS purchase agreements.\n\nCustomers responsible for Paying unrecovered costs stipulation\n\n29.    The parties, except ETI, agreed that to the extent there are costs unrecovered as a result of\n       the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be borne solely by customers\n       taking service under the CGS tariff, i.e., CGS customers.         ETI did not oppose this\n       stipulation.\n\nJanuary 20, 2012 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\n\n30.    In the CGS stipulated matters and stipulated facts filed on January 20, 2012, the parties\n       stated they had reached an agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        000000010\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                        Interim Order                               Page 11 of 17\n\n\n\n       the overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs, which were listed in\n       Section I. A-G of the stipulation. However, many of those items are simply elements of\n       larger program issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects essential to final\n       resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in principle exists, subject\n       to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues, include the following:\n\n       A.      Eligible CGS suppliers\n\n               1.        Eligible CGS suppliers will be limited to qualifying facilities that are or\n       will be directly connected to ETI.       Any expansion of eligible CGS suppliers would\n       require initiation of new Commission proceedings.\n\n       B.      Amount of CGS capacity\n\n               1.        A CGS customer will specify the amount of its load to be served by a\n       specified CGS supplier.\n\n               2.        The specified CGS supplier will enter into a contract with Entergy\n       Services, Inc., on behalf of ETI, or directly with ETI, for the purpose of becoming an\n       Entergy system network resource. The agreement between the CGS supplier and Entergy\n       Services, Inc. or ETI shall include a contract for the purchase of capacity and energy\n       (CGS purchase agreement). Per determination of the Entergy Operating Committee, the\n       capacity and energy contracted for under the CGS purchase agreements shall be allocated\n\n        solely to ETI.\n\n               3.        The level of capacity contracted for under the CGS purchase agreement\n        (CGS contract capacity) will be the same level of capacity contracted for in a separate but\n        related contract between the CGS supplier and the CGS customer.\n\n               4.        The monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be calculated monthly based on\n        the on-peak energy deliveries of CGS-supplied energy from the CGS supplier.              The\n\n        monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be the lesser of the CGS contract capacity and the\n        result of the following calculation-on a rolling 12-month basis (using a cumulative basis\n        during the first 11 months), the sum of the CGS-supplied energy delivered by the CGS\n        supplier during on-peak hours, divided by the number of on-peak hours during the same\n        time period, divided by 0.8.     On-peak hours are defined as the hours ending 7:00 am\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        000000011\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                       Interim Order                              Page 12 of 17\n\n\n       through 10:00 pm Monday through Saturday, excluding North American Electric\n\n       Reliability Corporation holidays.\n\n       C.      CGS-customer unbundled rate\n\n               1.      CGS customers are limited to, and will remain, ETI retail customers.\n\n               2.      ETI will not make a capacity payment to the CGS supplier, and the CGS\n       customer will not pay ETI the embedded production cost in the firm rate schedule under\n       which the customer would otherwise be eligible to receive service.\n\n               3.      The price for retail delivery service, including necessary ancillary\n       services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive generation\n       tariff will be a rate that is unbundled from ETI's cost of service and that will be\n       determined by a credit to the CGS customer's bill based on the unbundled production\n       costs associated with the otherwise applicable firm rate.\n\n              4.       The unbundled, embedded production cost for a LIPS customer based on\n       current rates is $6.84 per kW per month. The CGS credit is subject to review and\n       modification in subsequent rate cases. If the clause \"less any corresponding concurrent\n       reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer\" referenced in section F.1 below is\n       adopted, then certain parties may recommend a further adjustment to the LIPS embedded\n       production cost specified in this paragraph C.4.\n\n               5.      With the exception of the capacity credit and fixed fuel factor, a CGS\n       customer will pay ETI a retail rate that includes all other charges the customer would pay\n       as a firm customer (for example Rider TTC, HRC, SRC, SRO, and IFF charges, if\n       applicable).\n\n       D.     CGS energy payment\n\n               l.      CGS customers will pay fuel costs based on avoided cost for\n       CGS-supplied energy. Specifically, ETI will purchase hourly CGS energy supplied by\n       the CGS supplier from the CGS contract capacity at the system hourly avoided-energy-\n       cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF. ETI will charge the CGS customer at the\n       same rate for that hourly CGS-supplied energy not to exceed the energy requirement of\n       the CGS customer.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      000000012\n\f                                             Interim Order                           Page 13 of 17\nPUC Docket No. 38951\n\n\n       E.       CGS customer fixed-cost contribution\n\n                l.     The level of compensation to ETI from CGS customers for CGS service\n\n       will include a monthly fixed charge called a fixed-cost contribution.\n\n                2.      The fixed-cost contribution will be $1.10 per kW of CGS load per month.\n\n                3.      Revenues from the fixed-cost contribution will reduce any otherwise\n\n       unrecovered costs associated with the program.\n\n       F.       CGS customer unserved energy rate\n\n                 l.     If, in any hour in a delivery month, there is hourly CGS unserved energy,\n       the CGS customer will take service from ETI under the CGS unserved energy rate.\n        Hourly CGS unserved energy is the difference in any given hour between the amount of\n        energy corresponding to the full amount of CGS contract capacity and the amount of\n        energy actually supplied to ETI from the CGS contract capacity by the CGS supplier in\n        such hour, not to exceed the energy requirement of the CGS customer. The parties have\n        not agreed whether the following clause should be added to this last sentence: \"less any\n        corresponding concurrent reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer.\"\n\n                 2.     The structure of the CGS unserved energy tariffed rate will include an\n        agreed energy charge and agreed O&M adder. The monthly CGS unserved energy\n        charge will be the sum of (a) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times 105%\n        of the system hourly avoided energy cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF and\n        (b) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times specified variable O&M charges\n\n        specified immediately below in paragraph 3.\n\n                 3.     The specified variable O&M charges for the CGS unserved energy rate are\n        as follows:\n\n            Delivery Voltage                    On-Peak Per kWh        Off-Peak Per kWh\n\n            Distribution (less than 69kV)       $0.03555               0.00540\n\n            Transmission     (69kV     and      $0.02451               0.00222\n\n            greater)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     000000013\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                       Interim Order                              Page 14 of 17\n\n\n\n                4.      On-peak and off-peak hours for the CGS unserved energy rate are as\n       follows:\n\n                        a.     Summer: On-peak hours are 1:00 pm to 9:00 pm Monday through\n       Friday of each week beginning on May 15 and continuing through October 15 of each\n       year except that Memorial Day, Labor Day and Independence Day (July 4 or the nearest\n       weekday if July 4 is on a weekend) are not on-peak.\n\n                        b.     Winter: On-peak hours for each week of Monday through Friday\n       beginning October 16 and continuing through May 14 of each year are 6:00 am to\n       10:00 am and 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm, except that Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and\n       New Year's Day (or the nearest weekday if the holiday should fall on a weekend) are not\n       on-peak.\n\n                        c.    Off-peak hours are all hours of the year not specified as on-peak\n       hours.     With the approval of the Commission, ETI may at its sole discretion change\n       on-peak hours and season from time to time.\n\n                5.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from the variable\n       O&M charges will go towards offsetting any unrecovered costs as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS tariff.\n\n                6.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from 105% of the\n      system hourly avoided energy charges will go towards offsetting ETI's eligible fuel costs.\n\n      G.        Recognition of CGS supply as firm capacity.         Progress has been made on\n      resolving issues regarding the recognition of CGS capacity as firm capacity, but final\n      resolution of these issues, including the following, is contingent on the Entergy Operating\n      Committee's approval as well as a final resolution of all issues.\n\n                1.     The Entergy Operating Committee has established certain conditions that\n      must be met before it will recognize a CGS purchase agreement as \"capability\" for the\n      Entergy System, for purposes of determining reserve equalization payments or receipts.\n      The parties are continuing to discuss the conditions established by the Operating\n      Committee.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      000000014\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                       Interim Order                              Page 15 of 17\n\n\n\n               2.      The capacity product from CGS purchase agreements will be a 24/7\n       unit-contingent product.\n\n               3.      The delivery term of CGS purchase agreements may be from one year to\n\n       five years, and must be a whole number of years.\n\n               4.      The contract capacity will be a fixed capacity amount throughout any\n\n       successive 12-month period during the contract term.\n\n               5.      The parties have tentatively agreed to a number of concepts for firming up\n        CGS capacity that would be reflected in a form contract for use in implementing the CGS\n        program. The parties will continue to negotiate other concepts and terms for inclusion in\n\n        a form supply contract.\n\n31.     The parties stipulated that the Strategic Resource Plan (SRP) for the Entergy system (of\n        which ETI is a part) projects a continuing need for additional capacity for ETI and the\n        Entergy system through 2017. Entergy's and ETI's resource needs are subject to change\n        at any time based on actual experience related to operational conditions, resource offers\n        and solicitations, and other events that affect resource needs.\n\n32.     The parties stipulated that based on an assessment of load requirements and generating\n        capability, the SRP projects that ETI has an incremental net resource deficiency of\n\n        260 MW in 2012 and 504 MW in 2013.\n\n33.     The parties stipulated that the Entergy system-wide planning process is conducted\n        pursuant to the requirements of the Entergy system agreement and is designed to result in\n        a portfolio of resources that differ by term and source. The Entergy system agreement\n        states that the objective of this process is to ensure cost-effective, reliable levels of\n\n        service.\n\n 34.    The parties stipulated that CGS purchase agreements are resources that will be included\n        in the Entergy System's portfolio of supply resources, consistent with the terms and\n        conditions related to the delivery requirements of those purchase agreements (e.g., degree\n\n        of dispatchability, term, degree of firmness).\n\n 35.    The parties stipulated that it is reasonable at the outset of the CGS program to establish a\n        cap on the amount of load that may subscribe to CGS service.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       000000015\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                        Interim Order                                 Page 16 of 17\n\n\n36.    The parties stipulated that the range of the cap should be between 80 MW and 150 MW.\n\nUnrecovered costs\n\n37.    It is reasonable to adopt the three unopposed stipulation-and-settlement agreements\n       regarding customer eligibility for the CGS program; the customers responsible for paying\n       for unrecovered costs; the capacity deficit; and the program cap.\n\n38.    PURA § 39.452(b) provides for the utility to be able to recover any costs unrecovered as\n       a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\n39.    In CenterPoint, the Third Court of Appeals found that because the language of\n       PURA § 39.905 did not specifically provide for recovery of \"lost revenues\" and that in at\n       least two other provisions of PURA the legislature expressly distinguishes \"costs\" from\n       \"revenues,\" the term \"costs,\" as used by the legislature in PURA § 39.905, is not\n       intended to include lost revenues.       Like PURA § 39.905, PURA § 39.452(b) only\n       provides for \"costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff\" and does not\n       specifically provide for the utility to recover lost revenues or any other type of costs.\n\n40.    The Commission finds that the costs that will be unrecovered as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS program tariff are the costs to implement and administer the\n       CGS program tariff.\n\n\n\n                                   VI.      Conclusions of Law\nl.    The Commission has jurisdiction and authority over this proceeding pursuant to PURA\n       §§ 14.001 and 39.452(b).\n\n2.     PURA § 39.452(b) does not allow for the recovery of lost revenue or embedded\n      generation costs.\n\n\n\n                                VII.     Ordering Paragraphs\nl.    The Commission adopts each of the three stipulation-and-settlement agreements filed on\n      January 20, 2012, April 30, 2012, and April 18, 2012.\n\n2.    The parties shall work to reach an agreement on the issues that are considered contingent\n      on the Commission's decision on the threshold issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          000000016\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                   Interim Order                        Page 17 of 17\n\n\n\n3.

(“Company”) shall\n       implement and adjust rates for recovery of Unrecovered Service Cost resulting from\n       customers participating in the Company’s Competitive Generation Service (“CGS\n                                                                                                             N\n       Program”). The purpose of this Rider is to provide a mechanism for recovery of such\n       Unrecovered Service Costs that were included in the Company’s last general rate case\n       proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Texas (”PUCT”).\n\nII. APPLICABILITY\n\n       This Rider is applicable under the regular terms and conditions of the Company to all\n       electric service billed under the Company’s rate schedules subject to the jurisdiction of\n       the PUCT, with the exception of service billed under the Competitive Generation Service\n       Rider (“Rider CGS”).\n\nIII. RATE\n\n       All electric service accounts with the exception of service billed under Rider CGS will be\n       billed the Rider CGSUSC rates shown on Attachment A, as determined by application of\n       Attachment B.\n\nIV. RECOVERY PERIOD\n\n       This Rider is effective with the first billing cycle of ______, 201_ following the PUCT’s\n       approval of the initial rate to be charged under Rider CGSUSC. ETI will file a request for\n       PUCT approval of the initial rate no earlier than six (6) months after the PUCT’s approval\n       of the CGS Program. This Rider will remain in effect until termination of the CGS\n       Program and recovery of any remaining Unrecovered Service Cost. The redetermined\n       rates described in § V below shall become effective for bills rendered on and after the\n       first billing cycle of ______ immediately following the filing year and shall remain in effect\n       for a twelve (12) month billing period, unless otherwise terminated or superseded.\n\nV. TRUE-UP PROVISION\n\n       The rates shown on Attachment A will be adjusted annually as shown on Attachment B to\n       reflect the actual Unrecovered Service Cost incurred due to the CGS Program. On or\n       before _________ 1st of each year the Company shall file with the PUCT a revision of\n       this Rider that incorporates the actual Unrecovered Service Cost for the twelve (12)\n       months ending with _______ (“Test Period”) less any recovery under this Rider during\n       the Test Period plus or minus any prior Cumulative Over/Under Recovery plus interest.\n       Cumulative Over/Under Recovery for the Test Period is defined as the prior period\n       Cumulative Over/Under Recovery plus the difference between Unrecovered Service Cost\n\n                                   (Continued on reverse side)\n\f                                                                                       Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                      Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                             ETI OFFER OF PROOF NO. 1\n                                                                                    ([KLELW\u0003'55\u00106'\u0010\u0017\u0003\n                                                                                                54 of 86\n                                                                                    'RFNHW\u00031R\u0011\u0003\u0016\u001b\u001c\u0018\u0014\u0003\n                                                                                         3DJH\u0003\u0015\u0003RI\u0003\u0018\n\n                                                                                        Page __.2\n\n      incurred and revenues received from this Rider during the Test Period.

The Rider CGSUSC Recovery Amount shall be the\n      sum of the Cumulative Over/Under Recovery for the Test Period plus interest less any\n      CGSUSC Offsets as described in § VI below and in Attachment B. The Rider CGSUSC\n      Recovery Amount shall be allocated to the rate classes using the Production Demand\n      Allocation Factors from the most recent base-rate case adjusted to remove CGS\n      Program load and energy. The resulting rate class allocations of the Rider CGSUSC\n      Recovery Amount will be divided by the rate class billing determinants for the Test\n      Period, as adjusted to remove expected CGS Program load and energy, to determine\n      Rider CGSUSC rate class charges.\n\nVI. CGSUSC OFFSETS\n\n      CGSUSC Offsets are defined as 1) the $/kW reduction in ETI’s obligations under Entergy\n      System Agreement Service Schedule MSS-1 associated with ETI’s acquisition of CGS\n      Supplied Capacity (as defined by Rider CGS), which will be calculated pursuant to\n      Attachment B; and 2) the revenues received from the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee (as\n      defined by Rider CGS) for the Test Period.

INTERIM ADJUSTMENT\n\n      Should a change in the level of estimated Rider CGSUSC Recovery Amount exceed $2\n      million, greater or less than, the estimate included in the most recently filed determination\n      under this CGSUSC Rider, then the Company may propose an interim revision to the\n      then currently effective CGSUSC rate.\n\nVIII.STAFF AND COMMISSION REVIEW\n\n      Staff shall, and any affected person may, review the ETI filed Rider CGSUSC rate to\n      verify that the formula in Attachment B has been correctly applied and shall notify the\n      Company of any necessary corrections within sixty days. After completion of this review\n      of the rate calculation, the Company shall make appropriate changes to correct\n      undisputed errors identified in the review process. Any disputed issues arising out of this\n      review process are to be resolved by the PUCT after notice and hearing.\n\n\n\n\nRIDER SCHEDULE CGSUSC\n\f                                                                                          Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                         Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                                ETI OFFER OF PROOF NO. 1\n                                                                                       ([KLELW\u0003'55\u00106'\u0010\u0017\u0003\n                                                                                                   55 of 86\n                                                                                       'RFNHW\u00031R\u0011\u0003\u0016\u001b\u001c\u0018\u0014\u0003\n                                                                                            3DJH\u0003\u0016\u0003RI\u0003\u0018\n\n                                                                                          Page ___.3\n\n                                ATTACHMENT A\n                             ENTERGY TEXAS, INC.\n          COMPETITIVE GENERATION SERVICE UNRECOVERED SERVICE COST\n                           RIDER SCHEDULE CGSUSC\n\nNet Monthly Rate\n                                                                                                              N\nThe following Rate Adjustments, as determined by Attachment B, will be added to the rates set\nout in the Net Monthly Bill for electric service billed under applicable retail rate and rider\nschedules* on file with the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

Introduction\n       This order addresses Entergy Texas, Inc.'s (ETI's) application for a competitive\ngeneration service (CGS) under PURA § 39.452(b). The Commission approves ETI's CGS rider\nand competitive generation service cost (CGSC) rider as set out in this order.\n\n       This order incorporates the Commission's interim order issued in this docket on\nJune 12, 2012 and the Commission's rulings adopting in part and rejecting in part the stipulation\nand settlement agreement filed by ETI, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC), and\nCommission Staff on May 17, 2013. The interim order addressed the Commission's decision\nregarding three threshold issues surrounding ETI's CGS program. The May 17 settlement, as\nadopted in part and rejected in part, resolves all other contested issues in this docket.\n\n\n\n                                       II. Procedural History\n       ETI submitted its proposed CGS tariff and related riders in Docket No. 37744, its last rate\ncase.' In that rate case, the parties settled on all issues except for ETI's CGS proposal. After a\nhearing on the CGS proposal and the associated riders, the administrative law judge (ALJ)\nforwarded the parties' stipulation and settlement agreement and the proposal for decision to the\nCommission for consideration.\n\n\n\n\n        I Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs,\nDocket No. 37744, Corrected Application (Feb. 23, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          o^\n\f PUC Docket No. 38951                              Order                                        Page 2 of 27\n\n\n\n            The Commission considered the settlement and the proposal for decision at the\nNovember 10 and December 1, 2010 open meetings. The Commission adopted the settlement\n for the rate case issues and severed the CGS issues into this docket, including the record in\nDocket No. 37744.2\n\n            At the December 1, 2010 open meeting, the Commission requested the parties to enter\ninto negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined CGS program\nissues as possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\nthe Commission for consideration. Status reports were filed on January 13 and 28, February 18,\nMarch 11, and April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that\nthey were working to narrow the contested issues.\n\n            On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\na motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket.                     TIEC and\nCommission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion. At its\nSeptember 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and issued an\norder requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that have been\nsettled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could not be reached.\nThe parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent upon the Commission's\ndetermination of the unsettled issues.\n\n        On November 1, 2011, several parties3 filed an agreed list of settled issues. However, the\nparties did not agree on a recommendation as to how the unsettled issues and issues that are\ncontingent on the Commission's determination of unsettled issues should be addressed and\nresolved by the Commission. Therefore, TIEC also separately filed a list of unsettled issues and\nrequest for procedural schedule. TIEC also requested that the Commission receive additional\n\nevidence in order to resolve the unrecovered costs issue because ETI's proposal in Docket\nNo. 37744 was based on ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and\ncapacity-based program.

Many of the items were simply elements of larger\nprogram issues that retained, at that time, one or more unsettled aspects essential to final\nresolution of that program issue. Items as to which there was agreement in principle were\n\"subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.\"5\n\n       On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                                       On\nFebruary 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\nFebruary 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.                       The\nparties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n       On April 13, 2012, the parties submitted an unopposed stipulation on the threshold issue\nregarding customers responsible for paying unrecovered costs. The parties, except ETI, agreed\nthat CGS customers would be the only ETI customers responsible for unrecovered costs of the\nCGS program. ETI did not join or oppose this stipulation.6                  On April 18, 2012, the parties\nsubmitted a third stipulation on customer eligibility stating that large industrial power service\n(LIPS) customers would be the CGS-eligible customers, with certain limitations on the LIPS\ncustomers' participation and other program minimums and caps.7\n\n       The Commission held a hearing on the remaining contested threshold issue-what types\nof costs will be considered unrecovered for purposes of PURA § 39.452(b)-on April 19, 2012.\n\n\n       4 TIEC's Response to Joint Motion for Decision on Proposal for Decision at 4 (Sep. 15, 2011).\n       5 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts (Jan. 20, 2012).\n       6 Unopposed Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 3 (Apr. 13, 2012).\n\n       7 Stipulation on Unresolved Issue No. 2 (Apr. 18, 2012).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                      Page 4 of 27\n\n\n\nAn interim order was issued on June 12, 2012. It was expected that the parties would reach\nagreement on the remaining issues.\n\n        On November 27, 2012, TIEC filed a motion to adopt a CGS program and submitted\nproposed CGS riders for approval. TIEC and ETI had not been able to resolve certain issues\nrelated to the CGS tariffs and TIEC stated that continued negotiations would only result in\nfurther delay of the implementation of the CGS program.8 Commission Staff requested that the\nparties be required to submit a procedural schedule to govern the handling of the docket.9 ETI\nsubmitted its own version of the CGS tariffs for approval and proposed procedures to lead to\nfinal disposition of this docket. 10\n\n        The Commission ALJ issued Order No. 10 adopting a procedural schedule that required\nthe parties to indicate by February 8, 2013 whether a hearing was necessary. TIEC filed a letter\nstating that no party intended to file a request for a live hearing to cross-examine witnesses on\nthe remaining contested issues.ll Cities, OPUC, ETI, TIEC, and Commission Staff filed briefs\non March 1, 2013 and reply briefs on March 20, 2013. At the April 25, 2013 open meeting, the\nparties gave oral argument and the Commissioners discussed the Entergy Operating Committee\nreview of the capacity component of the CGS program and the proposed MISO regulatory\nchange provision.      The Commission deferred its ultimate decision on all of the issues to the\nMay 9, 2013 open meeting.\n\n        On May 8, 2013, TIEC filed a letter stating that TIEC and ETI had reached a preliminary\nagreement on the remaining disputed issues, but that the other parties had not had an opportunity\nto review the agreement. 12 At the May 9 open meeting, the Commission deferred consideration\nof the docket until the May 23, 2013 open meeting.\n\n        ETI filed a stipulation and settlement agreement on May 17, 2013 that addressed each of\nthe disputed issues that remained in this case.         ETI, TIEC, and Commission Staff signed the\n\n\n        8 TIEC's Motion to Adopt a Competitive Generation Services Program (Nov. 27, 2012).\n         9 Commission Staff's Response to TIEC's Motion to Adopt a Competitive Generation Services Program\n(Dec 4, 2012).\n\n        10 Entergy's Response to TIEC's Motion to Adopt Competitive Generation Services Program and Motion\nfor Adoption of Competitive Generation Services Tariffs at 1-2 (Dec. 4, 2012).\n        11 Letter from TIEC (Feb. 8, 2013).\n        12\n           Letter from TIEC (May 8, 2013).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                  Order                                      Page 5 of 27\n\n\nstipulation. The stipulation and settlement agreement included agreement on all of the issues\nregarding the CGS rider, i.e., how the CGS program would work, but delayed approval of the\ncompetitive generation service cost (CGSC) rider, which is the rider that will include\n\nimplementation and administration costs for the CGS program, for a later date.\n\n        Specifically, the signatories to the settlement agreed that the CGSC rider would not be\nproposed for approval, but would be filed with the Commission no earlier than six months after\nthe CGS rider becomes effective.             The parties also stipulated to five issues that would be\naddressed in the CGSC rider docket. ETI noted that Commission Staff supports the stipulation,\nbut did not take a position relating to the deferral of the consideration of issues regarding the\nCGSC rider.13 OPUC, joined by Kroger Company, Wal-Mart Stores, LLC, and Sam's East, Inc.\n\nfiled a statement of opposition to the stipulation stating that their opposition was limited to\nSection II.B. of the stipulation, which allows the delay of the resolution of the CGSC rider\nissues.14 Cities filed a letter on May 21 stating that it supports the resolution of the issues in the\nstipulation, but that they also support resolving all issues at this time in order to conserve judicial\nresources and provide certainty to parties in future cases.15               TIEC filed a response to the\nopposition16 and OPUC, Kroger, Wal-Mart, and Sam's East filed a reply to TIEC's response. 17\n\n       The Commission considered this docket again on the merits at the May 23, 2013 open\nmeeting. The Commission adopts the May 17, 2013 stipulation and settlement agreement in\npart, but rejects the deferral of approval of the CGSC rider set out in section II.B.2. of the\nstipulation. The Commission adopts the stipulation and settlement agreement as it pertains to the\n\nCGS rider, and makes findings on the outstanding issues related to the CGSC rider.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n            Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (May 17, 2013).\n       14 Joint Statement of Position (May 17, 2013).\n       15\n          Cities' Letter Addressing the Settlement Reached by Entergy and TIEC (May 21, 2013).\n       16 TIEC's Response to OPUC's Statement of Opposition (May 21, 2013).\n       17 Joint Reply to TIEC's Response to the Joint Statement of Opposition (May 22, 2013).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                        Page 6 of 27\n\n\n                                             III.    Discussion\n         PURA18 § 39.452(b) requires ETI to propose a CGS tariff that would require ETI to\npurchase CGS, selected by the CGS customer, and provide the generation at retail to the\ncustomer. ETI is required to provide and price retail transmission service, including necessary\n\nancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive\ngeneration tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the utility's cost of service.              Competitive\ngeneration customers are not to be considered wholesale transmission customers.                 The statute\nrequired the Commission to approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than\nSeptember 1, 2010. The CGS tariff may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates\nunder Section 36.007, and ETI's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is\nadopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff. The\nstatute requires the Commission to ensure that a competitive generation tariff not be\nimplemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers that\nchoose not to take advantage of competitive generation. PURA § 39.452(b) also prohibits the\nCommission from issuing a decision relating to the competitive generation tariff that is contrary\nto an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having\njurisdiction.\n\n         The Commission finds that the three stipulation and settlement agreements submitted by\nthe parties in January and April 2012 are reasonable and adopts them to the extent they do not\nconflict with other Commission determinations in this docket.\n\n         The Commission also finds that unrecovered costs are only those costs necessary to\nimplement and administer the CGS program and are not to be defined to include lost revenues,\nembedded generation costs, or any other types of costs.\n\n         Finally, the Commission finds that the May 17, 2013 stipulation with regard to the CGS\n\nrider is reasonable and adopts that portion of the stipulation. The Commission declines to adopt\nthe stipulation regarding the CGSC rider, and finds that the issues regarding the CGSC rider\nshould not be deferred and that the CGSC rider should not include costs prior to implementation\nof the CGS program; LIPS and LIPS time-of-day customers should be responsible for the CGSC\n\n\n\n         18 Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), TEx.

Unrecovered Costs\n        As explained in the interim order, the meaning of \"costs unrecovered as a result of\nimplementation of the CGS program tariff,\" as used in PURA § 39.452(b), was the subject of the\nApril 19, 2012 hearing. In the proposal for decision, the ALJ found that ETI is entitled to collect\nunrecovered embedded generation costs and any other related base rate costs as a result of\ncustomer migration to the CGS program.t9\n\n        ETI argued that unrecovered costs should be defined as the embedded production costs\nand any other related base rate costs that would have been recovered through traditional rates\ncharged to CGS customers that will no longer be recovered due to the CGS program. 2' TIEC\ntook the position that unrecovered costs should not include ETI's hypothetical lost revenues and\nthat the costs that could be unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff should include\nthe expenditures actually incurred by ETI to implement and maintain the CGS program.21 Cities\nand OPUC agreed with TIEC that unrecovered costs are not the same thing as unrecovered\nrevenues.22 Cities also noted that it would be unreasonable to allow ETI to continue to incur\ncosts for a customer the utility no longer plans to serve.23\n\n        In making its determination of the definition of unrecovered costs, the Commission\nfollows the precedent set in CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC v.

Such unrecovered costs do not include lost\nrevenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs. The Commission reverses the\nproposal for decision on this issue.\n\n\n                   B. May 17, 2013 Stipulation and Settlement Agreement\n        The Commission adopts the May 17, 2013 stipulation and settlement agreement in part,\nand rejects the settlement in part.\n\n        Under the terms of the stipulation, the parties agreed on issues relating to a CGS credit\namount, a fixed cost contribution fee, unserved energy, a termination payment, a force majeure\nclause, the Entergy Operating Committee, and MISO. Those issues are covered under findings\nof fact 53A-H. Under the stipulation, decisions regarding the CGS cost rider were to be deferred\nuntil no earlier than six months after the CGS rider became effective. The Commission adopts\nthe stipulation except for the portion of the stipulation that would defer decisions regarding the\nCGS cost rider. The Commission elects to make those decisions now rather than deferring them,\nand no party at the open meeting objected to this proposal.\n\n\n                                        C.

Cost Recovery if the CGS program is unsubscribed\n\n        ETI proposed that if the CGS program is unsubscribed, the CGSC rider rate would apply\nto the classes that are eligible to participate in the program.29 Commission Staff agreed with ETI\nand noted that even if the costs incurred to implement the program are de minimis because there\nare no subscribers, ETI would still be entitled to recover those costs under PURA § 39.452(b).3o\nOPUC agreed with ETI and Commission Staff.31 TIEC urged the Commission to defer this issue\nuntil the facts are not speculative in order to balance the twin charges of the statute of allowing\nETI to recover any costs that are unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff and\nensuring that the tariff is not implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or\ncompetitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of the CGS program.32\n\n       The Commission finds that ETI should be allowed to recover CGSC rider costs in the\nevent that there are no subscribers to the CGS program, because PURA § 39.452(b) entitles ETI\nto recover those costs. The Commission finds that those costs should be borne by the customer\nclass that the program was designed to benefit-the LIPS and LIPS-TOD customers-the\ncustomers that are eligible to participate in the program. The Commission adopts the language\nproposed by ETI on this issue in Section III of the redlined tariff.\n\n\n\n\n       27 TIEC's Initial Brief at 21-24.\n       28 Commission Staff's Initial Brief at 6-7 (March 1, 2013).\n       29 ETI's redlined tariff version Exhibit DRR-SD-6 at 1, Section III Rate.\n       3 0 Commission\n                       Staff s Initial Brief at 7 (March 1, 2013).\n       31 OPUC's Reply Brief at 12 (March 20, 2013).\n       32 TIEC's Initial Brief at 24-25 (March 1, 2013).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                     Order                              Page 10 of 27\n\n\n3. Interest\n\n        Citing PURA § 39.452(b), that ETI should be allowed to recover any costs unrecovered\nas a result of implementing the tariff, ETI requested recovery of interest on the unrecovered\nbalance of the CGSC rider charges.33 TIEC noted that the CGSC rider would be periodically\nadjusted to reflect ETI's actually incurred costs, so there would be no need for ETI to accrue\ninterest on any unrecovered balance.\n\n        The Commission finds that not allowing interest would be consistent with the treatment\nof rate-case expenses, which are typically amortized over a three-year period without a return on\nthe unamortized balance.34 ETI should not be permitted to recover interest on the unrecovered\nbalance of the CGSC rider charges.\n\n4. CGSC rider costs recovered in rate-base offset\n\n        OPUC argued that the interim order is clear that the costs to implement the CGS program\nare to be borne only by CGS customers. However, $299,372 was included in ETI's base rates\nfor costs related to the CGS program and will be paid by all retail customer classes.            OPUC\nrecommended that the same amount that is being recovered from all retail customers in base\nrates for CGS costs be recovered solely through the CGSC rider. Since the LIPS class is being\ncharged $49,192 per year in base rates, OPUC recommended that the CGS rider should be\nreduced by $49,192 to prevent double-recovery and that the remainder that is being recovered in\nretail base rates, $249,960, should be refunded directly to each class in the amount allocated in\nbase rates.35\n\n        TIEC took the position that OPUC was attempting make a collateral attack on the\nCommission's order in ETI's rate case.                  Furthermore, TIEC argues that ETI should not be\nrequired to conduct OPUC's proposed \"offset\" for the same reason that ETI should not be\n\npermitted to include costs incurred since November 2010-the costs are not costs to implement\nthe CGS program.36\n\n\n\n\n        33 ETI's Initial Brief at 24 (March 1, 2013).\n       34 TIEC's Initial Brief at 25 (March 1, 2013).\n       35 OPUC's Initial Brief at 3-7 (March 1, 2013).\n\n       36 TIEC's Reply Brief at 17-18 (March 20, 2013).\n\f PUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                        Page 11 of 27\n\n\n         ETI proposed to credit the CGSC rider with $299,372 to recognize amounts that were\nused in setting ETI's current base rates. This amount represents the amount of CGS-related costs\nthat ETI is already recovering in base rates pursuant to the Commission's order in ETI's most-\nrecent rate case, Docket No. 39896.37\n\n         The Commission agrees with TIEC on this issue and goes further to state that to permit\nan offset to the CGSC rider for amounts already included in rates may be retroactive ratemaking.\n\n5.       Amount to be recovered in the CGSC rider\n\n         The Commission does not reach the issue of the amount to be recovered for the\nimplementation and administration costs at this time because the amount cannot be known until\nETI actually implements the program.\n\n\n\n                                             IV.      Conclusion\n         The Commission adopts each of the stipulation and settlement agreements except for\nsection II.B.2 of the May 17, 2013 stipulation, and finds that unrecovered costs for the CGS\nprogram are those needed to implement and administer the CGS program and are not lost\nrevenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs. The Commission finds that\nETI should not be able to recover any costs via the CGSC rider until the CGS program is\nimplemented, that ETI should be allowed to recovery CGSC rider costs in the event that there are\nno subscribers to the CGS program, that ETI should not be permitted to recover interest on the\nunrecovered balance of the CGSC rider charges, and that ETI should not be required to conduct\nOPUC's proposed \"offset.\"\n\n\n\n\n         37 Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for Authority to Change Rates, Reconcile Fuel Costs, and Obtain\nDeferred Accounting Treatment, Docket No. 39896, Order (Sept. 14, 2012).\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                               Order                                      Page 12 of 27\n\n\n\n                                         V.

As part of its application in Docket No. 37744, Application of Entergy Texas, Inc. for\n        Authority to Change Rates and Reconcile Fuel Costs, ETI proposed a competitive\n         generation service ( CGS) program pursuant to Public Utility Regulatory Act. Tex. Util.\n         Code Ann. (PURA) § 39.452(b).\n\n2.       On July 16, 2010 and July 20, 2010, a State Office of Administrative Hearings\n         administrative law judge held a hearing on the merits on ETI's CGS proposal.\n\n3.      A proposal for decision was issued on November 1, 2010.                     The ALJ ultimately\n        recommended that the CGS proposal be rejected.\n\n4.      The Commission considered the proposal for decision at the November 10 and\n        December 1, 2010 open meetings as part of docket No. 37744. At the December 1, 2010\n        open meeting, the Commission adopted the settlement for the rate case issues and severed\n        the CGS proposal into this Docket. The Commission requested that the parties enter into\n        negotiations and work to come to agreement on as many of the undetermined issues as\n        possible, and then bring the issues for which an agreement could not be reached back to\n        the Commission for consideration.\n\n5.      Order No. 1 was issued on December 3, 2010 severing the CGS issues into this docket,\n        including the record in Docket No. 37744.\n\n6.      Sabine Cogen, LP filed a motion to intervene in this docket on December 23, 2010. ETI\n        filed an objection to Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene on December 30, 2010.\n        Sabine Cogen, LP's motion to intervene was denied in Order No. 3 on January 12, 2011.\n\n7.      ETI, Commission Staff, Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Industrial Energy\n        Consumers, State Agencies, Kroger Co., Cities,38 Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC and\n        Sam's East, Inc., and Cottonwood Energy are parties to this proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n        38 The cities of Anahuac, Beaumont, Bridge City, Cleveland, Conroe, Groves, Houston, Huntsville,\nMontgomery, Navasota, Nederland, Oak Ridge North, Orange, Pine Forest, Pinehurst, Port Arthur, Port Neches,\nRose City, Shenandoah, Silsbee, Sour Lake, Splendora, Vidor, and West Orange.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                            Order                                   Page 13 of 27\n\n\n8.     On January 11, 2011, the Commission AU issued Order No. 2 requiring ETI to either\n\n       provide an update on the status of settlement discussions or to propose a schedule, agreed\n       to by all parties, for finalizing the outstanding issues.\n\n9.     The parties filed status reports on January 13 and 28, February 18, March 11, and\n       April 8, 2011. These reports indicated that parties continued to negotiate and that they\n       thought that they could narrow the issues.\n\n10.    On September 8, 2011, State Agencies, Cities, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart jointly filed\n       a motion requesting a decision on the proposal for decision in this docket. TIEC and\n       Commission Staff filed responses to the joint motion and generally opposed the motion.\n       At the September 29, 2011 open meeting, the Commissioners considered the motions and\n       issued an order requiring the parties to file pleadings identifying the CGS tariff issues that\n       have been settled on by the parties and identifying the issues for which a settlement could\n       not be reached. The parties were also permitted to identify issues that are contingent\n       upon the Commission's determination of the unsettled issues.\n\n11.    On November 1, several parties filed an agreed list of settled issues.            TIEC also\n       separately filed a list of unsettled issues and request for procedural schedule. TIEC also\n       requested that the Commission receive additional evidence in order to resolve the\n       unrecovered costs issues because ETI's proposal in Docket No. 37744 was based on\n       ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an energy and capacity-based program.\n       The circumstances had changed primarily due to the agreement of the Entergy Operating\n       Committee to treat CGS power from qualifying facilities in the ETI service territory as\n       firm generation. The remainder of the parties filed a joint agreed list of unsettled issues\n       and issues contingent on a Commission determination of unsettled issues.\n\n12.    At the December 8 and December 15, 2011 open meetings, the Commissioners decided\n       that the parties should submit stipulated facts, the Commission would re-open the record\n       to admit additional evidence as requested by TIEC, and then the Commission would\n       make a decision on the three threshold unsettled issues in an interim order.\n\n13.    On December 18, 2011, Order No. 4 was issued establishing a procedural schedule.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                             Order                                    Page 14 of 27\n\n\n14.    On January 20, 2012, the parties submitted agreed settlement terms and stipulated facts.\n\n       The parties reached agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within the\n       overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs.             Many of the items were simply\n       elements of larger program issues that retain one or more as yet unsettled aspects\n       essential to final resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in\n       principle existed were \"subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues.\"\n\n15.    On January 24, 2012, Order No. 5 was issued clarifying the number of copies of\n       testimony that were to be filed by the parties.\n\n16.    On January 26, 2012, ETI submitted supplemental direct testimony.                           On\n       February 10, 2012, the intervenors submitted supplemental direct testimony and on\n       February 25, 2012, ETI and intervenors submitted rebuttal and cross rebuttal testimony.\n       The parties submitted statements of position and pre-hearing briefs on March 26, 2012.\n\n17.    Order No. 6 was issued on February 1, 2012 setting April 19, 2012 as the date for the\n       hearing.\n\n18.    On April 13, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation that to the extent there are\n       costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be\n       borne solely by customers taking service under the CGS tariff. ETI did not join but did\n       not oppose the stipulation.\n\n19.    On April 18, 2012, the parties filed an unopposed stipulation regarding customer\n       eligibility. LIPS customers will be eligible to participate in ETI's CGS program (with\n       further limitations as set forth in the stipulation on this issue).\n\n20.    The Commission held the hearing on the merits on April 19, 2012, and issued an interim\n       order on June 12, 2012 that adopted the unopposed issues and ruled that the types of costs\n       that will be considered ETI's unrecovered costs for purposes of PURA § 39.452(b) are\n\n       those costs necessary to implement and administer the CGS program and are not to be\n       defined to include lost revenues, embedded generation costs, or any other types of costs.\n\n21.    Subsequent to the interim order, the parties continued discussions regarding how to\n       develop a CGS tariff (or tariffs) that would conform to the interim order rulings and\n      resolve other remaining contested issues.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                         Order                                   Page 15 of 27\n\n\n22.    On November 27, 2012, TIEC filed a motion to adopt a competitive generation services\n       program that included its proposed Rider Schedule CGS and Rider Schedule CGSC, the\n       latter of which addressed ETI's recovery of its costs of implementing and administering\n       the CGS program. TIEC's motion also addressed a number of issues that the parties had\n       not been able to resolve, and asked that the Commission rule in TIEC's favor on those\n       remaining contested issues.\n\n23.    On December 4, 2012, ETI filed a response to TIEC's November 27 motion. ETI's\n       response addressed the same contested issues raised by TIEC and asked the Commission\n       to rule in favor of ETI's position. ETI's response also included its own versions of the\n       CGS and CGSC riders (based on its positions on the contested issues), plus a redlined\n       version of both riders that compared TIEC's versions to ETI's versions.\n\n24.    On January 7, 2013, in response to a motion filed by TIEC, the Commission issued a\n       procedural schedule that required parties to file supplemental testimony in support of\n       their positions later in January and early February, and that parties were to indicate, on\n       February 8, 2013, whether a hearing was necessary. Interested parties filed supplemental\n      testimony in accordance with that schedule, and no party requested an evidentiary\n      hearing.\n\n25.   On February 19, 2013, the Commission issued an agreed briefing schedule which called\n      for parties to file a joint motion to stipulate testimony and RFIs into the record on\n      February 25, and for parties to file initial and reply briefs on March 1 and 20,\n      respectively, which briefs were filed by ETI, TIEC, Staff, OPUC, and Cities.\n\n26.   On May 8, 2013, TIEC filed a letter stating that TIEC and ETI had reached a preliminary\n      agreement on the remaining disputed issues and asked that this matter be deferred to the\n      next open meeting.      All parties indicated their agreement with the deferral.      The\n      Commission deferred consideration until the May 23, 2013 open meeting.\n\n27.   On May 17, 2013, ETI filed a stipulation and settlement agreement, which was supported\n      by TIEC and Staff, but with Staff taking no position on Sections II.B.1 and 2 of that\n      settlement.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                  Page 16 of 27\n\n\n28.     On May 17, 2013, OPUC, Kroger, and Wal-Mart filed a Joint Statement of Opposition to\n\n        the May 17 settlement. Their opposition was limited to Section II.B. of that settlement\n        and pertained to the proposed delay in deciding certain issues before the Commission,\n        including which customer classes should pay for costs recovered through the CGSC rider\n        in the event there are no CGS program subscribers, and the treatment of CGS project\n        code costs \"embedded\" in ETI's base rates in accordance with the Commission's order in\n        Docket No. 39896.\n\n29.     TIEC filed a response to the Joint Statement of Opposition on May 21, 2013.\n\n30.     OPUC, Kroger and Wal-Mart filed a joint reply to TIEC's response on May 22, 2013.\n\n31.     The Commission considered this matter at its May 23, 2013 open meeting, at which it\n        voted to accept in part and reject in part the May 17 settlement.\n\nElisible customers stipulation\n32.     The parties agreed that only customers eligible to take service under ETI's Large\n        Industrial Power Service (LIPS) are eligible customers for the CGS program.\n\n33.     The parties agreed that only LIPS firm load will be eligible to participate in the CGS\n        program.\n\n34.     The parties agreed that LIPS customers with interruptible service (IS) or standby and\n       maintenance service (SMS) load are not precluded from participating in the CGS\n       program, but this participation is limited to their firm LIPS load.   To the extent that\n       customers with IS load participate in the CGS program, they must comply with the terms\n       of the IS tariffs regarding minimum LIPS load. Only the portion of the customer's LIPS\n       load that is in excess of the firm contract power minimum requirement under section 1 of\n       Schedule IS is eligible for the CGS program.\n\n35.    The parties agreed that to the extent there are increased administration costs associated\n       with billing a customer that has CGS and IS or SMS load, the CGS customer will bear the\n       costs.\n\n36.    The parties agreed that there will be a 115 MW cap on the CGS program.\n\n37.    The parties agreed that there will be a 5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                            Order                                    Page 17 of 27\n\n\n38.    The parties agreed that there will be no aggregation of CGS customer load to meet the\n\n       5 MW minimum on CGS customer load.\n\n39.    The parties agreed that there will be a cap of 10 CGS purchase agreements.\n\nCustomers responsible for nayinQ unrecovered costs stipulation\n\n40.    The parties, except ETI, agreed that to the extent there are costs unrecovered as a result of\n       the implementation of a CGS tariff, those costs should be borne solely by customers\n       taking service under the CGS tariff, i.e., CGS customers.          ETI did not oppose this\n       stipulation.\n\nJanuary 20, 2012 CGS Stipulated Matters and Stipulated Facts\n\n41.    In the CGS stipulated matters and stipulated facts filed on January 20, 2012, the parties\n       stated they had reached an agreement in principle on a number of discrete items within\n       the overall framework of the CGS program and tariffs, which were listed in\n       Section I. A-G of the stipulation. However, many of those items were simply elements of\n       larger program issues that retained one or more unsettled aspects essential to final\n       resolution of that program issue. Items as to which agreement in principle existed,\n       subject to satisfactory resolution of unsettled issues, included the following:\n\n       A.      Eligible CGS suppliers\n\n               1.      Eligible CGS suppliers will be limited to qualifying facilities that are or\n       will be directly connected to ETI.      Any expansion of eligible CGS suppliers would\n       require initiation of new Commission proceedings.\n\n       B.      Amount of CGS capacity\n\n               1.      A CGS customer will specify the amount of its load to be served by a\n       specified CGS supplier.\n\n               2.      The specified CGS supplier will enter into a contract with Entergy\n       Services, Inc., on behalf of ETI, or directly with ETI, for the purpose of becoming an\n       Entergy system network resource. The agreement between the CGS supplier and Entergy\n       Services, Inc. or ETI shall include a contract for the purchase of capacity and energy\n       (CGS purchase agreement). Per determination of the Entergy Operating Committee, the\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                  Order                                          Page 18 of 27\n\n\n         capacity and energy contracted for under the CGS purchase agreements shall be allocated\n\n         solely to ETI.\n\n                  3.      The level of capacity contracted for under the CGS purchase agreement\n         (CGS contract capacity) will be the same level of capacity contracted for in a separate but\n         related contract between the CGS supplier and the CGS customer.\n\n                 4.       The monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be calculated monthly based on\n         the on-peak energy deliveries of CGS-supplied energy from the CGS supplier.                          The\n         monthly CGS supplied capacity shall be the lesser of the CGS contract capacity and the\n         result of the following calculation-on a rolling 12-month basis (using a cumulative basis\n         during the first 11 months), the sum of the CGS-supplied energy delivered by the CGS\n         supplier during on-peak hours, divided by the number of on-peak hours during the same\n         time period, divided by 0.8.         On-peak hours are defined as the hours ending 7:00 am\n         through 10:00 pm Monday through Saturday, excluding North American Electric\n         Reliability Corporation holidays.\n\n         C.       CGS-customer unbundled rate\n\n                  1.      CGS customers are limited to, and will remain, ETI retail customers.\n\n                  2.      ETI will not make a capacity payment to the CGS supplier, and the CGS\n         customer will not pay ETI the embedded production cost in the firm rate schedule under\n         which the customer would otherwise be eligible to receive service.\n\n                  3.      The price for retail delivery service, including necessary ancillary\n         services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive generation\n         tariff will be a rate that is unbundled from ETI's cost of service and that will be\n         determined by a credit to the CGS customer's bill based on the unbundled production\n         costs associated with the otherwise applicable firm rate.\n\n                 4.       The unbundled, embedded production cost for a LIPS customer based on\n         current rates is $6.84 per kW per month.39 The CGS credit is subject to review and\n        modification in subsequent rate cases. If the clause \"less any corresponding concurrent\n\n\n         39 The parties subsequently agreed to set this amount at $6.50 per kW per month until rates are changed in\nETI's next base rate case (that is, the next base rate case after May 16, 2013). Finding of Fact No. 53A.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Order                                  Page 19 of 27\n\n\n       reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer\" referenced in section F.1 below is\n\n       adopted, then certain parties may recommend a further adjustment to the LIPS embedded\n\n       production cost specified in this paragraph C.4.\n\n               5.      With the exception of the capacity credit and fixed fuel factor, a CGS\n       customer will pay ETI a retail rate that includes all other charges the customer would pay\n       as a firm customer (for example Rider TTC, HRC, SRC, SRO, and IFF charges, if\n       applicable).\n\n       D.      CGS energy payment\n\n               1.      CGS customers will pay fuel costs based on avoided cost for\n       CGS-supplied energy. Specifically, ETI will purchase hourly CGS energy supplied by\n       the CGS supplier from the CGS contract capacity at the system hourly avoided-energy-\n       cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF. ETI will charge the CGS customer at the\n       same rate for that hourly CGS-supplied energy not to exceed the energy requirement of\n       the CGS customer.\n\n       E.      CGS customer fixed-cost contribution\n\n               1.      The level of compensation to ETI from CGS customers for CGS service\n       will include a monthly fixed charge called a fixed-cost contribution.\n\n               2.      The fixed-cost contribution will be $1.10 per kW of CGS load per month.\n\n               3.      Revenues from the fixed-cost contribution will reduce any otherwise\n       unrecovered costs associated with the program.\n\n       F.      CGS customer unserved energy rate\n\n               1.      If, in any hour in a delivery month, there is hourly CGS unserved energy,\n       the CGS customer will take service from ETI under the CGS unserved energy rate.\n       Hourly CGS unserved energy is the difference in any given hour between the amount of\n       energy corresponding to the full amount of CGS contract capacity and the amount of\n       energy actually supplied to ETI from the CGS contract capacity by the CGS supplier in\n       such hour, not to exceed the energy requirement of the CGS customer. The parties have\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                    Page 20 of 27\n\n\n\n       not agreed whether the following clause should be added to this last sentence: \"less any\n       corresponding concurrent reduction in energy purchased by the CGS customer.\"40\n\n               2.       The structure of the CGS unserved energy tariffed rate will include an\n       agreed energy charge and agreed O&M adder. The monthly CGS unserved energy\n       charge will be the sum of (a) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times 105%\n       of the system hourly avoided energy cost as determined under Rate Schedule LQF and\n       (b) the hourly CGS unserved energy for the month times specified variable O&M charges\n       specified immediately below in paragraph 3.\n\n                3.      The specified variable O&M charges for the CGS unserved energy rate are\n       as follows:\n\n         Delivery Voltage                         On-Peak Per kWh               Off-Peak Per kWh\n\n         Distribution (less than 69kV)            $0.03555                      0.00540\n\n         Transmission         (69kV      and      $0.02451                      0.00222\n         greater)\n\n                4.       On-peak and off-peak hours for the CGS unserved energy rate are as\n       follows:\n\n                         a.      Summer: On-peak hours are 1:00 pm to 9:00 pm Monday through\n       Friday of each week beginning on May 15 and continuing through October 15 of each\n       year except that Memorial Day, Labor Day and Independence Day (July 4 or the nearest\n       weekday if July 4 is on a weekend) are not on-peak.\n\n                        b.       Winter: On-peak hours for each week of Monday through Friday\n       beginning October 16 and continuing through May 14 of each year are 6:00 am to\n       10:00 am and 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm, except that Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and\n       New Year's Day (or the nearest weekday if the holiday should fall on a weekend) are not\n       on-peak.\n\n\n\n\n       40 The parties subsequently agreed that this quoted language would be added.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Order                                   Page 21 of 27\n\n\n                       c.     Off-peak hours are all hours of the year not specified as on-peak\n       hours.    With the approval of the Commission, ETI may at its sole discretion change\n       on-peak hours and season from time to time.\n\n                5.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from the variable\n       O&M charges will go towards offsetting any unrecovered costs as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS tariff.\n\n                6.     Revenues from the CGS unserved energy rate derived from 105% of the\n       system hourly avoided energy charges will go towards offsetting ETI's eligible fuel costs.\n\n       G.       Recognition of CGS supply as firm capacity.         Progress has been made on\n       resolving issues regarding the recognition of CGS capacity as firm capacity, but final\n       resolution of these issues, including the following, is contingent on the Entergy Operating\n       Committee's approval as well as a final resolution of all issues.\n\n                1.     The Entergy Operating Committee has established certain conditions that\n       must be met before it will recognize a CGS purchase agreement as \"capability\" for the\n       Entergy System, for purposes of determining reserve equalization payments or receipts.\n       The parties are continuing to discuss the conditions established by the Operating\n       Committee.\n\n                2.     The capacity product from CGS purchase agreements will be a 24/7\n       unit-contingent product.\n\n                3.     The delivery term of CGS purchase agreements may be from one year to\n       five years, and must be a whole number of years.\n\n                4.     The contract capacity will be a fixed capacity amount throughout any\n       successive 12-month period during the contract term.\n\n                5.     The parties have tentatively agreed to a number of concepts for firming up\n       CGS capacity that would be reflected in a form contract for use in implementing the CGS\n       program. The parties will continue to negotiate other concepts and terms for inclusion in\n       a form supply contract.\n\n42.    The parties stipulated that the Strategic Resource Plan (SRP) for the Entergy system (of\n       which ETI is a part) projects a continuing need for additional capacity for ETI and the\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                  Page 22 of 27\n\n\n       Entergy system through 2017. Entergy's and ETI's resource needs are subject to change\n\n       at any time based on actual experience related to operational conditions, resource offers\n\n       and solicitations, and other events that affect resource needs.\n\n43.    The parties stipulated that based on an assessment of load requirements and generating\n       capability, the SRP projects that ETI has an incremental net resource deficiency of\n       260 MW in 2012 and 504 MW in 2013.\n\n44.    The parties stipulated that the Entergy system-wide planning process is conducted\n       pursuant to the requirements of the Entergy system agreement and is designed to result in\n       a portfolio of resources that differ by term and source. The Entergy system agreement\n       states that the objective of this process is to ensure cost-effective, reliable levels of\n       service.\n\n45.    The parties stipulated that CGS purchase agreements are resources that will be included\n       in the Entergy System's portfolio of supply resources, consistent with the terms and\n       conditions related to the delivery requirements of those purchase agreements (e.g., degree\n       of dispatchability, term, degree of firmness).\n\n46.    The parties stipulated that it is reasonable at the outset of the CGS program to establish a\n       cap on the amount of load that may subscribe to CGS service.\n\n47.    The parties stipulated that the range of the cap should be between 80 MW and 150 MW.\n\n48.    It is reasonable to adopt the three unopposed 2012 stipulation and settlement agreements\n       regarding customer eligibility for the CGS program; the customers responsible for paying\n       for unrecovered costs; the capacity deficit; and the program cap.\n\nUnrecovered costs\n\n49.    PURA § 39.452(b) provides for the utility to be able to recover any costs unrecovered as\n       a result of the implementation of the tariff.\n\n50.    In CenterPoint, the Third Court of Appeals found that because the language of\n       PURA § 39.905 did not specifically provide for recovery of \"lost revenues\" and that in at\n       least two other provisions of PURA the legislature expressly distinguishes \"costs\" from\n       \"revenues,\" the term \"costs,\" as used by the legislature in PURA § 39.905, is not\n       intended to include lost revenues.       Like PURA § 39.905, PURA § 39.452(b) only\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                      Page 23 of 27\n\n\n       provides for \"costs unrecovered as a result of implementation of the tariff' and does not\n\n       specifically provide for the utility to recover lost revenues or any other type of costs.\n\n51.    The Commission finds that the costs that will be unrecovered as a result of the\n       implementation of the CGS program tariff are the costs to implement and administer the\n       CGS program tariff.\n\nThe May 17, 2013 Stipulation and Settlement Agreement\n\n52.    The May 17 settlement addresses the remaining contested issues that were not resolved\n       through the 2012 stipulation and settlement agreements and the interim order.               The\n       substantive provisions of the May 17 settlement address the CGS rider, the CGSC rider,\n       and appeal rights.\n\n53.    Agreements as to CGS Rider:\n\n       A.        CGS Credit: The parties agree to a CGS credit set at $6.50 per kW/month until\n       rates are changed in ETI's next base rate case.\n\n       B.        Unserved Energy: The parties agree to accept TIEC's proposed CGS rider tariff\n       language in the Second Supplemental Direct Testimony of Jeffry Pollock, which will\n       allow a CGS customer to attempt to decrease its load to match a decrease in deliveries by\n       the CGS supplier and thereby avoid unserved energy charges to the extent the CGS\n       customer's CGS load is reduced.\n\n       C.        Termination Payment:    The parties agree to remove ETI's proposed liquidated\n       damages provisions from the CGS rider and deal with liquidated damages provisions in\n       the supplier contract negotiations. The amount of liquidated damages, if any, received by\n       ETI shall be used to offset any capacity costs incurred by ETI to replace the lost CGS\n       supply.\n\n       D.        The Tracking Certificate:      The parties agree to remove ETI's proposed\n       prioritization provisions in Section G(5) and H from the tracking certificate (leaving them\n       to contract negotiations) and delete the provisions that would require the CGS customer\n       to provide what TIEC deemed \"competitively sensitive\" information.\n\n       E.        Force Majeure:   The parties agree to remove TIEC's proposed force majeure\n       provision.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                         Order                                   Page 24 of 27\n\n\n       F.      The Entergy Operating Committee: The parties agree to remove the following\n\n       ETI-proposed \"reservation\" provision from the CGS rider:\n               In addition, entering into new ETI-Supplier Contracts under the CGS\n               Program (i.e., ETI-Supplier Contracts that have not already been entered\n               into by ETI in response to CGS Service requests) at any given time must\n               be consistent with the Entergy System's need for capacity. Capacity\n               resources associated with the CGS Program will receive no preferential\n               treatment, but will be considered as part of the Entergy System's planning\n               process on the same basis as other potential capacity resources.\n               Recognition of the capacity component of the CGS Program on an\n               ongoing basis is contingent on periodic Entergy Operating Committee\n               conclusion that ETI requires the capability that would be obtained through\n               this program component.\n\n\n               ETI shall have the right by notice to the applicable customer, to deny or\n               terminate a request for CGS Service at any time prior to entering into the\n               ETI-Supplier Contract corresponding to such request if the limitations in\n               the penultimate paragraph of § I above apply ...\n\n\n               The following clause in Rider CGS Section III.B.3 of ETI's proposed\n               Rider CGS is modified as follows: Unless a CGS Service request is earlier\n               denied or terminated according to tariff provisions (or provisions of law)\n               applicable to the CGS Service ...\n        G.     MISO: The parties agree that ETI's proposed RTO/MISO provision will stay in\n        the CGS rider, but the phrase \"it will be necessary or appropriate to include [MISO terms\n        and conditions]\" is changed to \"it may be appropriate to include [MISO terms and\n        conditions).\"\n\n        H.     $1.10 Fixed Cost Contribution Fee: The parties agree that this fee will not be\n        applied as an offset to CGS administration and implementation costs.\n\n54.     Agreement as to CGSC Rider:\n\n        A.     ETI has agreed that an application for the CGSC rider will be filed with the\n        Commission no earlier than six months after the CGS rider becomes effective.\n\n        B.     Section II.B.2. in the May 17, 2013 settlement was challenged by OPUC, Kroger,\n        and Wal-Mart, with Cities also supporting resolution of the issues in Section II.B.2. now,\n        rather than deferring them as proposed in the May 17, 2013 settlement.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                          Order                                    Page 25 of 27\n\n\n       C.      Other than Section II.B.2, no other sections of the May 17 settlement were\n       opposed by OPUC, Kroger, Wal-Mart, or Cities, and were supported by ETI, TIEC, and\n       Commission Staff. The Commission finds that those unopposed provisions in the May\n       17 settlement are reasonable and in the public interest.\n\n       D.      The record from the current CGS docket (Docket No. 38951) and from Docket\n       No. 37744 shall be incorporated into the record in the CGSC rider application docket.\n\n       E.      All parties agree that only the variable O&M portion of the unserved energy rate\n       should be used to offset the unrecovered implementation and administrative costs. Fuel-\n       related revenues from the unserved energy rate will offset ETI's fuel balance, and not be\n       used to offset unrecovered costs.\n\n       F.      There will be no changes to ETI's current base rates as a result of this proceeding.\n\n55.    Agreement as to Appeal Rights: The parties agree that ETI is not waiving its right to\n       appeal the Commission's final order to the courts on any issues that are not resolved by\n       settlement in this docket.    All parties reserve their rights under applicable state and\n       federal law.\n\n56.    Proposed CGS Program Tariff: The proposed CGS program tariff (the CGS rider), which\n       is attached to the May 17 settlement as Attachment 1, is agreed to by the parties and\n       represents the CGS program as set out in the preceding Findings of Fact.\n\n57.    The Commission makes the following findings regarding the five issues within Section\n       II.B.2. of the May 17 settlement:\n\n       A.      The appropriate date upon which ETI is authorized to begin accruing CGS\n       program implementation and administration costs is the date that the CGS Rider\n       implemented.\n\n       B.      In the event there are no subscribers to the CGS program, it is reasonable and\n       appropriate for unrecovered implementation and administration costs accrued to the\n       CGSC rider will be charged to the LIPS and LIPS-TOD customers, the customer class\n       that the program was designed to benefit.\n\n       C.      It is not appropriate for ETI to recover interest on the unrecovered balance of the\n       CGSC rider charges.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                           Order                                     Page 26 of 27\n\n\n       D.      It is not appropriate for there to be an offset to the CGSC rider for amounts\n       included in rates in Docket No. 39896.\n\n       E.      The Commission declines to address at this time the amount to be recovered as\n       implementation and administration costs because such amount is not known at this time.\n\n\n\n                                     V1.    Conclusions of Law\n1.     The Commission has jurisdiction and authority over this proceeding pursuant to PURA\n       §§ 14.001 and 39.452(b).\n\n2.     PURA § 39.452(b) does not allow for the recovery of lost revenue or embedded\n       generation costs.\n\n\n\n                                  VII.     Ordering Paragraphs\n1.     The Commission adopts each of the three stipulation and settlement agreements filed on\n       January 20, 2012, April 30, 2012, and April 18, 2012.\n\n2.     The Commission adopts each of the provisions of the stipulation and settlement\n       agreement filed on May 17, 2013, except for section II.B.2, pertaining to deferring\n       decisions on issues related to (a) the date ETI uses to start accruing implementation costs,\n       (b) whether rider CGSC will also recover interest on unrecovered costs, (c) whether any\n       historical costs billed to the CGS project code that are currently in base rates should be\n       removed from base rates, credited, and recovered through rider CGSC, and (d) who pays\n       if there are no subscribers. Those issues are resolved as set forth in this order.\n       Accordingly, the Commission adopts in part and rejects in part the May 17 settlement as\n       set forth in this order.\n\n3.     The CGS rider, attached to the May 17 stipulation and settlement agreement, is approved\n       as of the date of this order. ETI shall file a clean CGS rider tariff in this docket within 10\n       days of the date of this order.\n\n4.     In the event there are no subscribers to the CGS program, unrecovered implementation\n       and administration costs accrued to the CGSC rider will be charged to the LIPS and\n       LIPS-TOD customers, the customer class that the program was designed to benefit.\n\fPUC Docket No. 38951                                Order                                    Page 27 of 27\n\n\n5.         ETI is not authorized to recover interest on the unrecovered balance of the CGSC rider\n           charges.\n\n6.         There shall be no offset to the CGSC rider for amounts included in rates in Docket\n           No. 39896.\n\n7.         The Commission declines to address at this time the amount to be recovered as\n           implementation and administration costs because such amount is not known at this time.\n\n8.         The date upon which ETI is authorized to begin accruing CGS program implementation\n           and administration costs is the date that the CGS Rider is implemented.\n\n9.         ETI shall not file an application for the CGSC rider earlier than six months after the CGS\n          rider becomes effective. ETI shall file an application for the CGSC rider in accordance\n          with the agreement approved by this order.\n\n10.       All other motions, requests for entry of specific findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n           and any other requests for general or specific relief, if not expressly granted, are denied.\n\n\n\n           SIGNED AT AUSTIN, TEXAS the\n                                                     g      L\n                                                            day of July 2013\n\n\n\n                                          PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION OF TEXAS\n\n\n\n\n                                          DONNA L.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES AND REQUEST FOR PROCEDURAL SCHEDULE\n\n        TIEC's list of unsettled issues in Section II below reflects the common language that has\nbeen agreed upon by the parties to identify the remaining unsettled CGS issues. The parties have\nworked in good faith to identify the remaining contested issues related to implementation of a\nCGS program. The parties were not able to agree on the procedures for resolving these contested\nissues, however, and thus are filing separate pleadings. While TIEC believes that it may be more\nexpeditious for the Commission to take up all of the unresolved issues at once, TIEC is not\nopposed to the other parties' preference to have the Commission first address certain preliminary\ncontested issues, if the Commission so desires. Preliminary issues could include the following:\n\nA.      Unrecovered Costs\n\n         In TIEC's view, this issue dwarfs all others and has been the primary impediment to a\nworkable CGS program from the outset. The position of TIEC (and others) at the hearing in this\nmatter during the summer of 2010 was that Entergy had not shown that there would be any\nunrecovered costs (other than potential administrative costs) as a result of the CGS program.\nEntergy, on the other hand, indicated that there would be a substantial amount of unrecovered\ncosts, at one point asserting that it could be as much as $75 million. The potential magnitude of\nthat issue is substantially reduced given the parties' progress on (1) a cap on the CGS program\nand (2) procedures to firm up the capacity provided by CGS suppliers so that it would be counted\nas firm capacity by the Entergy system. Nonetheless, the dispute remains concerning whether\nthere would be any unrecovered costs and, if so, the amount.\n\n\n                                                                                            2l\nAUS 647538.3\n\f        The CGS statute essentially provided that retail customers who choose to take CGS\nservice would pay an unbundled rate for transmission and ancillary services, but would obtain\ntheir generation from a competitive source.' ETI would purchase electricity from the identified\nsource and provide it to the CGS customer. TIEC's position has been that Entergy would be\nfully compensated for the unbundled transmission and ancillary services through the CGS rate,\nand Entergy would be fully compensated for the cost of the electricity by the CGS customer\npaying the full cost of the electricity bought on its behalf from the CGS supplier. Entergy's\nposition, on the other hand, has been that it would suffer lost revenues that it would otherwise\nreceive if the CGS customer were a full bundled customer, and that Entergy's other customers\nshould be required to pay Entergy for those lost revenues.\n\n        If the Commission desires to resolve this issue as a preliminary matter, the Commission\nshould receive limited additional evidence. The pre-filed testimony submitted in this case in late\n2009 or early 2010 no longer accurately reflects the facts, and the Commission should base its\ndecision on the actual facts as they exist today.       Notably, the evidentiary record that was\ndeveloped in Docket No. 37744 was based on ETI's proposal for an energy-only program, not an\nenergy and capacity-based program as reflected in the parties' list of settled issues. TIEC does\nnot anticipate that additional evidence would be lengthy, and it is possible that the parties could\nstipulate to key facts rather than submit testimony. In any case, the items on which the\nCommission would need evidence include the following:\n\n               •   The Entergy Operating Committee's recognition that, assuming certain\n                   conditions are met, capacity provided by a CGS supplier could be counted as\n                   system capacity, thereby reducing Entergy's capacity requirements.\n               •   The value of the capacity provided by the CGS supplier.\n               •   The fact that ETI's load growth since base rates were set is greater than the\n                   proposed capped amount of CGS load. As a result, the CGS program as capped\n                   would not result in any reduction in generation-related revenues for ETI, but\n                   would simply reduce the amount of ETI's load growth.\n               •   Operational savings that would accrue to ETI's customers from firming up\n                   Qualified Facility (QF) energy puts by using them as a source of 24 by 7, base\n                   load capacity.\n               •   What impact, if any, joining MISO would have on a CGS program.\n\n\n'See PURA § 39.452(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\nAUS.647538.3\n\f        Key facts on the above issues are not in the record at this time, and TIEC submits that the\nCommission cannot make an informed decision in this case without them. Accordingly, TIEC\nwould request an opportunity for the parties to submit record evidence on these issues in the\nform of stipulated facts, facts administratively noticed, or testimony on limited issues.\n\nB.      Responsibility for Paying any Unrecovered Costs\n\n        If the Commission determines that there are no unrecovered costs, then this is not an\nissue. If, however, the Commission determines that there are unrecovered costs, then Entergy is\nentitled under the statute to recover any such costs and the Commission would have to determine\nhow any such costs will be recovered.\n\nC.      Eligible CGS Customers\n\n        There are issues about whether eligibility for CGS service should be limited to certain\nrate classes, as ETI proposed, or should be available to all customers who can meet the necessary\nmetering requirements, including customers who may aggregate load.\n\n        The parties differ on the issue of whether the unsettled issues can be resolved based on\nbriefing on the existing record or whether, in addition to briefing, it may be appropriate for the\nCommission to take administrative notice of certain facts and/or accept limited additional\nevidence relevant to the settled and unsettled issues. TIEC's position is that the Commission\nshould establish a procedural schedule that would allow the Commission to take notice of facts\nand/or accept limited additional evidence relevant to the CGS issues, as well as briefing.\n\n        The need for a procedural schedule to address evidentiary issues should be apparent from\nthe face of the parties' joint list of settled issues.   The Commission is currently faced with a\nsubstantially different CGS proposal than was originally proposed by ETI almost two years ago\nin Docket No. 37744. Further, considerable time has passed since the close of the record in\nDocket No. 37744, and the evidence that was developed in that record is now stale (e.g.,\nforecasted load growth since the test year). It is TIEC's position that the work and effort that the\nparties have put into developing a revised CGS proposal will result in a much better program\nthan the one proposed by ETI in Docket No. 37744. Because the parties did not develop the\nevidence with the current proposal in mind, however, additional evidence is necessary to provide\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\nAUS 647538.3\n\finformation to the Commission that it could not otherwise consider based on the existing\n\nevidentiary record.\n\nII.   LIST OF UNSETTLED ISSUES\n\n        TIEC identifies specific unsettled issues, as follows:2\n\nA.      Unrecovered Costs3\n\nB.       Who are eligible CGS customers\n\nC.       Who is responsible for paying for any unrecovered costs\n\nD.       Unresolved issues related to recognition of CGS supply as firm capacity include4:\n\n         1)       Terms and conditions necessary for the CGS program to comply with capacity\n                  planning and acquisition principles under the Entergy System Agreement\n\n         2)       CGS Supply Contract minimum size\n\n         3)       Whether CGS Customer aggregation should be permitted\n\n         4)       Cost responsibility for transmission upgrades\n\n         5)       Commercial CGS Supply Agreement terms and conditions\n\nE.       Cap on CGS load - the level of an overall cap on the amount of customer load that would\n         be included in the CGS program (i.e., 80MW to 150MW)5\n\nF.       Appropriateness of using load growth as an offset to any unrecovered costs\n\nG.       Capacity value of the CGS capacity product\n\n H.      CGSC costs:\n\n\n\n\n 2 These descriptions are meant to be high level, and do not include all the component issues which affect the\n controversy surrounding these matters.\n\n 3 The parties disagree as to whether this issue is: \"The definition and calculation of any unrecovered costs\" or\n instead \"the definition, existence, and calculation of any unrecovered costs.\" TIEC's position is that the latter\n description of the issue is appropriate.\n\n 4 ETI maintains that matters such as these listed in Section II A fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FERC.\n If ETI and the Parties can reach an agreed resolution of these issues, the jurisdictional question will be avoided.\n\n 5 ETI maintains that matters such as these fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FERC. If ETI and the Parties\n can reach an agreed resolution of these issues, the jurisdictional question will be avoided.\n\n\n\n                                                           4\n AUS 647538.3\n\f        1)     Recovery of CGSC costs should there be no CGS participants\n\n        2)     Determination of the appropriate starting date for incurring recoverable CGSC\n               costs\n\n        3)     Whether CGSC costs should earn carrying costs\n\n1.      Whether a form contract is required for the successful implementation of the CGS\n        program\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n        For the above reasons, TIEC requests that the Commission adopt a schedule to allow\nadditional evidence and briefing on the unsettled issues.\n\n\n\n                                                 Respectfully submitted,\n                                                 ANDREWS KURTH LLP\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Rex D.

WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE PURPOSE OF THE\n\n12          CGSPROGRAM?\n\n13   A.     The CGS program, as provided for in its enabling legislation and as\n\n14          currently being discussed by the parties to this proceeding, is intended to\n\n15          provide a specific subset of customers (\"CGS Customers\") with the ability,\n\n16          consistent with the requirements of federal law and FERC tariffs including\n\n17          the Entergy System Agreement, to obtain generation service from an\n\n18          alternative supplier. In order to accomplish this objective, to address the\n\n19          Commission's concerns regarding cost shifting under the program, and to\n\n20          address other significant limitations imposed by the legislation (including\n\n21          the requirement that the CGS program not create a conflict with Federal\n\n22          law), the parties to this proceeding have engaged in extensive\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                 Page 3 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           negotiations and arrived at a tentative solution to at least some aspects of\n\n 2           the CGS program design.\n\n 3                   Under this collaborative proposal, customers eligible for CGS\n\n4            service will contract with a CGS Supplier, which must be a Qualified\n\n 5           Facility (\"QF\") as defined by Rate Schedule LQF in ETI's service territory,\n\n6           for a negotiated level of CGS capacity (\"Supplier-Customer Contract\").\n\n 7           ETI will not be a party to this contract; however, the Supplier/OF (\"CGS\n\n 8           Supplier\"), based on the Supplier-Customer Contract, will then enter into a\n\n 9           CGS Purchase Agreement with the Company for the same level of\n\n10           capacity as in the Supplier-Customer Contract. The capacity supplied by\n\n11           the CGS Purchase Agreement will take the form of a 24/7 unit contingent\n\n12           product.     Upon fulfillment of other as-yet unresolved conditions in a\n\n13           manner satisfactory to the Entergy Operating Committee, that committee\n\n14           has agreed to recognize that the CGS Purchase Agreement can provide\n\n15           firm capacity (or, in the terms of the Entergy System Agreement,\n\n16           \"capability\") to the Entergy System. 2\n\n17                   ETI will not make a capacity payment directly to the CGS Supplier.\n\n18           Instead, ETI will provide a credit to the CGS Customer equal to ETI's\n\n     2\n         The parties to the case, including ETI, have not reached agreement on all matters necessary\n         to establishment of a CGS program that includes such a capacity product.

IS THE INTENT OF THE CGS PROGRAM TO CREATE A CAPACITY\n\n10          MARKET FOR ETI?\n\n11   A.     No. The CGS program is not intended, or needed, as a means to fulfill\n\n12          ETI's resource needs and the Company would resist any effort to place a\n\n13          value on CGS capacity based on an alleged resource need for the\n\n14          program.      To the contrary, the CGS program, as I noted above, is\n\n15          designed as a means whereby a limited class of eligible customers could\n\n16          gain access to an alternative source of generation apart from that offered\n\n17          by ETI.\n\n18                  The Entergy system has and will continue to plan for and acquire\n\n19          short-term, limited-term and long-term resources needed by ETI to reliably\n\n20          serve its Texas customers.             However, if implemented properly and\n\n21          consistent with applicable legal requirements, the CGS program could\n\n22          provide a relatively modest amount of additional capacity for the Entergy\n\n\n\n                                                                                       l\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

PURA § 39.452(b), which provides the statutory authority for the CGS\n\n 8               program, provides that \"The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be\n\n 9               considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and\n\n10               [ETI's] rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to\n\n11               recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the\n\n12               tariff.\" The statute's definition of unrecovered costs is broad: \"any costs\n\n13               unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\" There are two\n\n14               categories of costs within this statutory provision: 1) implementation and\n\n15               administration cost (\"lA Cost\") associated with this program - this would\n\n16               include the cost of any billing systems, administration cost of the program\n\n17               going forward, and any cost incurred to develop and implement the\n\n18               program in the first instance; and 2) unrecovered costs (\"Unrecovered\n\n19               Costs\") that results due to CGS Customers no longer taking firm service\n\n20               from the Company. The lA Cost and its recovery is not one of the three\n\n21               threshold issues and will not be addressed in this testimony.\n\n22                      Unrecovered Costs should be defined as the embedded production\n\n23               costs and any other related base rate costs that would have been\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Because these customers\n\n 5           have switched to the CGS program, these embedded production costs\n\n 6           (less any potential offsets) would otherwise be unrecovered by ETI due to\n\n 7           implementation of the CGS program.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.      IS THIS DEFINITION OF THE STARTING POINT FOR UNRECOVERED\n\n10           COSTS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF UNRECOVERED\n\n11           COSTS      RECOGNIZED          IN THE     INITIAL EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\n12           REGARDING THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n13   A.      Yes.     In his Proposal For Decision, the ALJ reached the following\n\n14           conclusion regarding the nature of unrecovered costs:\n\n15                          The ALJ agrees with ETI that PURA § 39.452(b)\n16                   requires that \"the utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding\n17                   in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs\n18                   unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff,\"\n19                   and that the CGS legislation specifically authorized the\n20                   Company to recover any unrecovered costs as \"a result of'\n21                   implementation of the CGS program.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n\n\n1               Although the ALJ believed that there might be offsets to these\n\n2               unrecovered costs, he was clear in his recognition of embedded test year\n\n3               generation costs as the starting point for the measurement of unrecovered\n\n4               costs.\n\n 5\n\n6    Q.         WOULD       IT BE APPROPRIATE TO ADOPT A               DEFINITION        OF\n\n7               UNRECOVERED COSTS LIMITED TO WHAT YOU REFER TO ABOVE\n\n 8              AS THE lA COSTS?\n\n 9   A.         No, it would not. When ETI's rates are set in a base rate proceeding, the\n\n10              level of those rates is expressly determined so as to be sufficient to\n\n11              recover the reasonable and necessary production-related costs (including\n\n12              return on investment) that it incurred in a representative test year,\n\n13              adjusted for known and measureable changes. Those rates are further\n\n14              designed so that each of the Company's customers' rates contributes their\n\n15              share of those costs, consistent with principles of cost causation. As the\n\n16              ALJ stated, \"the ALJ agrees that ETI's revenue requirement is based on\n                                                                             4\n17              and designed to recover such [embedded production] costs.\"\n\n18                       When, for example, a Large Industrial Power Service (\"LIPS\")\n\n19              customer shifts part of its load to CGS service, it avoids payment of the\n\n20              share of ETI's embedded test year production costs allocated to it when\n\n21              base rates were set, because that load is now served through the CGS\n\n\n     4\n          /d.\n\n                                                                                           fo\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                     Page 8 of23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1            program. If ETI must absorb this loss, then it has failed to recover a part\n\n 2            of its production costs that its base rates were designed to recover. The\n\n 3            effect is the same as if the Commission had granted that particular\n\n 4            customer a discount rate for a portion of the service. As a general rule,\n\n 5            PURA requires that the utility, rather than its customers, absorb losses\n\n 6            associated with discount rates. 5           As quoted above, however, PURA §\n\n 7            39.452(b) is an exception to this rule, and expressly prohibits the CGS\n\n 8            program tariffs from being treated as offering a discount rate.\n\n 9                    The Company does not support proposals that shift risks or losses\n\n10            onto ETI. Any such proposal results in only a small group of customers\n\n11            obtaining a benefit at the expense of the Company, which is nothing more\n\n12            than a discount rate in disguise.\n\n13\n\n14   Q.       HOW IS THE CGS RATE FOR CUSTOMERS STRUCTURED, BASED\n\n15            ON THE CGS PROGRAM DESIGN DISCUSSED BY THE PARTIES\n\n16            DURING THEIR SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS?\n\n17   A.       The proposed CGS program provides a $/kW credit for the amount of\n\n18            CGS capacity supplied by the CGS Customer. 6 The parties' January 20\n\n19            Stipulation affirms (Stipulation I.C.3) that this $/kW credit should be based\n\n20            on the embedded production cost from the most recent ETI general rate\n\n\n     5\n          PURA § 36.007.\n     6\n          This credit approach is different from the ETI proposal at the time of the initial CGS hearing to\n          implement unbundled rates and is administratively more efficient. See Section I.C of the\n          Stipulation of Facts and Other Matters filed January 20, 2012.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

For\n\n 2          example, based on ETI's last full base rate case (Docket No. 37744), for\n\n 3          the LIPS rate class, this value is $6.84/kW as shown on Exhibit PRM-1.\n\n 4          Based on the Company's most recent filed base rate case in Docket No.\n\n 5          39896, again for the LIPS class, this value is $7.77/kW as shown on\n\n 6          Exhibit PRM-2. This $/kW credit recognizes that the CGS Customers will\n\n 7          be supplying a portion of their own production-related requirements via the\n\n 8          CGS supplied capacity and not receiving the generation supply associated\n\n 9          with ETI production costs for that amount of capacity supplied.\n\n10\n\n11   Q.     CAN YOU FURTHER DISCUSS WHY EMBEDDED PRODUCTION COST\n\n12          IS THE APPROPRIATE STARTING POINT FOR DETERMINING THE\n\n13          CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n14   A.     As I explained earlier, embedded production cost is the appropriate\n\n15          starting point because that is the amount that the CGS Customer will\n\n16          receive as a credit and will thereby avoid by taking some level of service\n\n17          under the CGS program, instead of continuing to take that level of service\n\n18          under its historical rate schedule. As described above, this credit is based\n\n19          on the embedded production cost incurred to serve that customer, and\n\n20          equates to the amount of contribution to fixed production costs previously\n\n21          provided by the CGS Customers, and thus is the starting point for\n\n22          calculating the CGS Unrecovered Costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                               Page 10 of 23\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1   Q.      ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL OFFSETS TO THIS STARTING POINT\n\n 2           FOR DETERMINING UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n 3   A.      Yes.    The current CGS program proposal under discussion among the\n\n4            parties is based upon energy supplied via a firm 24/7 product as described\n\n 5           earlier in my testimony, and by ETI witness O'Brien.                     The Entergy\n\n 6           Operating Committee has indicated that such a product may, under\n\n 7           appropriate conditions, be included in ETI's generating capability for\n\n 8           purposes of the Entergy System Agreement accounting and resource\n\n 9           planning. Provided that remaining outstanding issues regarding \"firming\n\n10            up\" CGS capacity can be resolved in a manner that is consistent with the\n\n11            Operating Committee parameters, the amount of capacity associated with\n\n12           the CGS Supplier-Customer Contracts will -                     unlike the capacity\n\n13           associated with the initial CGS proposal originally filed in Docket No.\n\n14           37744 - be considered ETI capability in the determination of ETI's\n\n15            payments pursuant to Entergy System Agreement Service Schedule\n\n16            MSS-1 (Reserve Equalization). 7 The inclusion of CGS capacity in the\n\n17            calculation of ETI's Schedule MSS-1 obligations is expected to reduce\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          MSS-1 obligations are calculated by comparing an Entergy Operating Company's (\"OPCO's\")\n          owned or controlled capability to the amount of capability that an OPCO should own or\n          control if it owned or controlled an amount of capability equal to its share of the System's\n          load. A company that owns or controls less capability that it should be responsible for is\n          known as a \"short\" company, and is required to compensate those OPCOs that are \"long\" for\n          the use of the long Company's reserves. ETI is a short OPCO, which means that adding\n          capability that the Operating Committee has determined to be eligible to ETI's total company\n          capability will reduce ETI's MSS-1 payments.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

HAVE YOU CALCULATED THE EFFECT OF CGS CAPACITY ON ETI'S\n\n 5          SCHEDULE MSS-1 PAYMENTS?\n\n 6   A.     Yes. Exhibit PRM-3 shows the calculation of the effects of CGS capacity\n\n 7          on ETI's Schedule MSS-1 obligations, based on a recent Intra System Bill.\n\n 8          Under Schedule MSS-1, when capacity is added incrementally to the\n\n 9          system each OPCO is responsible for their responsibility ratio share of this\n\n10          capacity.    When an OPCO is adding capacity, in this case ETI adding\n\n11          CGS capacity, the OPCO is comparatively longer and thus reduces its\n\n12          Schedule MSS-1 obligation.           In this example, the reduction amounts to\n\n13          $3.097/kW/month and would be an offset to the CGS Unrecovered Costs\n\n14          starting point ($6.84/kW/month under current rates) discussed above.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.     ARE THERE ANY OTHER OFFSETS TO THIS UNRECOVERED COSTS\n\n17           STARTING POINT?\n\n18   A.     Yes.    Under the settlement terms tentatively agreed to by the parties,\n\n19          other offsets would be the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee and the Unserved\n\n20           Energy O&M adder charges set out in the parties' January 20 Stipulation\n\n21           (Stipulations I.E.1-3, I.F.5). The Fixed Cost Contribution Fee is a fixed\n\n22          $/kW fee per month that each CGS Customer will pay and for which the\n\n23           revenues received by ETI will go to offset the CGS Unrecovered Costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          The Unserved Energy O&M adder is a fee the CGS Customers may or\n\n 2          may not pay depending on whether the CGS capacity was actually\n\n 3          supplied to ETI or not. Again, revenues received by ETI from this O&M\n\n4           adder will go to offset the CGS Unrecovered Costs.\n\n 5\n\n 6   Q.     OTHER PARTIES HAVE ARGUED THAT LOAD GROWTH SHOULD BE\n\n 7          AN OFFSET TO CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS. PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n 8   A       It has been suggested previously that revenues associated with load\n\n 9          growth should be an offset to unrecovered costs. Such a suggestion is\n\n10          inconsistent with the provision of the law that states: \" ... and [ETI's] rates\n\n11          shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any\n\n12          costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\" This\n\n13          language requires that the program be implemented within the base rate\n\n14          case in which the tariff is developed, in order that the embedded costs that\n\n15          are avoided by the CGS Customer would be readily identifiable.            Load\n\n16          growth is not a concept that can be appropriately applied within the\n\n17           context that rates are set in Texas based upon an historical test year with\n\n18           known and measureable costs.

The\n\n15          result of such an approach would be that revenues that would otherwise\n\n16          be available to offset increases in purchased power cost for customers,\n\n17          would instead be dedicated to the CGS program. The result of dedicating\n\n18          the growth in revenues to the CGS program would be the purchased\n\n19           power costs to be recovered from all customers, save for those taking\n\n20          CGS service, would increase. This inappropriate outcome further justifies\n\n21          the conclusion that load growth, to the extent it is utilized, should only\n\n22           offset incremental costs, and not embedded costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Any load growth adjustment would\n\n11          simply further reduce the earned ROE below the allowed level. An earned\n\n12           ROE below the allowed ROE is an indication that the Company's cost has\n\n13          increased at a higher rate than any load growth or increase in sales.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.      IS THERE ANOTHER MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS\n\n16          THESE LOAD GROWTH AND COST INCREASE ISSUES?\n\n17   A.     Yes. In Project 39246, the Commission is considering the development of\n\n18           a purchased power recovery (\"PPR\") rider applicable to ETI and other\n\n19          Texas vertically integrated utilities.      The PPR rider envisioned by ETI\n\n20           recognizes the benefits of load growth because it reflects the total\n\n21           revenues collected by the PPR rider. Thus, if revenues collected from the\n\n22           PPR rider have increased due to increased sales, this increase would\n\n23           automatically be reflected in updates to the PPR rider via the over( under)-\n\n                                                                                      11\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Likewise any debate on the value of\n\n12          load growth or its quantification as an offset would no longer be necessary\n\n13          because all increased revenues caused by the increased sales, whatever\n\n14          their level, would be reflected in the over/under recovery provision of the\n\n15           PPR rider.     For example, if sales increased by 5% and the purchased\n\n16          power cost decreased 3% in the same period, both of these effects would\n\n17           be reflected as reductions in the PPR rider, thereby automatically\n\n18           offsetting CGS Unrecovered Costs included in the PPR.                 This would\n\n19           eliminate any need to debate the extent to which CGS Capacity provided\n\n20          value that should offset CGS Unrecovered Costs, because any such value\n\n\n\n\n     8\n         The purchased power cost reflected in ETI's envisioned PPR rider would also include the\n         cost associated with Entergy System Agreement Service Schedule MSS-1.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

IS THERE ANY CAPACITY COST VALUE, OTHER THAN THAT\n\n 5          ASSOCIATED WITH SCHEDULE MSS-1, THAT CAN BE USED TO\n\n6           OFFSET THE CGS UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n 7   A      No. As demonstrated in the forgoing discussion, an offset is appropriate\n\n 8          only if the CGS program results in an actual reduction to ETI's revenue\n\n 9          requirement.      Accordingly, there are no grounds for an additional offset\n\n10          other than those previously discussed.\n\n11                  Further, as discussed by ETI witness O'Brien, many factors and\n\n12          characteristics must be considered when valuing capacity costs, such as\n\n13          the lack of flexibility, energy cost, firmness (unit contingent vs. system\n\n14          contingent), term, size (level of MW), location and ability to reduce\n\n15          operating constraints (reduction of QF put). A review of the characteristics\n\n16          of the capacity that ETI will acquire as a result of the CGS program\n\n17          indicates that the CGS capacity is not a product that would reasonably be\n\n18          expected to have a high level of value.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     (j\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

The Company proposes that the CGS Unrecovered Costs should be\n\n17           recovered from all non-CGS participating load.                  This is a slight\n\n18           modification from the Company's direct case position in which the\n\n19           Company was proposing that the CGS Unrecovered Costs should be\n\n20           recovered from all non-CGS customers. 9            This modification recognizes\n\n21           that there is a portion of a CGS Customer's load that is not supplied by the\n\n     9\n          See Docket No. 37744, Phillip R.

Therefore,\n\n 7           ETI's proposal for who should pay for Unrecovered Costs recognizes that\n\n 8          the proposed CGS firm capacity product is a generation resource, the cost\n\n 9          of which should be recovered from all customers.\n\n10\n\n11   a.     WHY SHOULD A NEW CUSTOMER, WHO DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO\n\n12          THE CREATION OF THE CGS PROGRAM, HAVE TO PAY FOR\n\n13           UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n14   A.     As stated above, the CGS capacity should be treated like any other supply\n\n15           resource and be recovered from all customers whether new or existing.\n\n16          Any other conclusion would imply that certain customer groups can select\n\n17           specific ETI generation resources to satisfy their needs. For example, this\n\n18          would imply that a new customer could elect to not pay for any River Bend\n\n19           Station    nuclear generation-related     costs   because   the   Company's\n\n20           acquisition of power from the River Bend Station was made and approved\n\n21           long before that customer became an ETI customer. Such a conclusion is\n\n22           contrary to traditional ratemaking whereby customers' rates are based on\n\n23           average cost pricing.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

But for the CGS program, a new customer would contribute to the\n\n 5           Company's embedded production fixed cost based on current base rates.\n\n6            However, because of the CGS program, the Company will not recover the\n\n 7           same level of fixed cost from the new customer had the CGS program not\n\n 8           been in effect.\n\n 9\n\n10                       V.      WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR CGS SERVICE\n\n11   Q.      WHAT IS THE COMPANY'S PROPOSAL FOR WHO SHOULD BE\n\n12           ELIGIBLE FOR CGS SERVICE?\n\n13   A       The Company continues to propose that only the LIPS class of customers\n\n14           be eligible for the CGS program. As stated in ETI's direct case, PURA\n\n15           § 39.452(b) is not intended to extend a competitive generation tariff\n\n16           offering to all customers. 10 The provision refers to \"eligible customers\"\n\n17           rather than to \"all customers.\" It is important to reiterate that the CGS\n\n18           program is not a provision for retail customer choice, or for a retail pilot\n\n19           project, as otherwise addressed in PURA Chapter 39.                     Given the\n\n20           complexity of the CGS program, it is appropriate to set reasonable\n\n\n     10\n          See Docket No. 37744, Phillip R.

Moreover, the statutory language's\n\n2           reference to protections for \"manufacturers\" who choose not to participate\n\n3           in the program suggests an expectation that this is the type of customer\n\n4           who otherwise will be participating. The Company continues to believe\n\n 5          that only large customers will have the size, sophistication, and capability\n\n6           to make use of the CGS service. Second, LIPS customers already have\n\n 7          the interval data recorder (\"lOR\") metering in place that is technically\n\n 8           required    for the     program.          Third,   the   administration   and   billing\n\n 9           requirements of the CGS program require a substantial amount of\n\n10           additional systems work and on-going manual intervention from the\n\n11           Company's Major Accounts Billing function.                  It cannot be easily or\n\n12           inexpensively expanded past a relatively small number of CGS Customers\n\n13           (customers/meters) without requiring a much larger system and personnel\n\n14           investment. Potentials for expanding the program beyond the LIPS class\n\n15           can be addressed in the annual reports to be filed by the Company but,\n\n16           until it is shown that expansion beyond that class is workable and\n\n17           appropriate, the eligible CGS Customers should be limited to the LIPS\n\n18           class.\n\n19\n\n20   Q.      COULD AGGREGATION ALLOW SMALLER CUSTOMERS TO QUALIFY\n\n21           FOR THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n22   A.      Theoretically, aggregation - by which I mean a group of customers\n\n23           pooling their load for purposes of utilizing CGS service - could allow such\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

However, as stated in the Company's direct case\n\n 2              and above, the CGS program is not intended to be retail open access. 11\n\n 3              Implementing the CGS program with aggregation across all customer\n\n 4              classes, or even just some classes in addition to the LIPS class, is\n\n 5              tantamount to retail open access, as there would be no limit on the retail\n\n 6              customers then \"eligible\" to participate in the choice of an alternative to\n\n 7              service from ETI. 12 In addition, on a more practical note, aggregation of\n\n 8              accounts raises complicated customer accounting and billing provisions. 13\n\n 9              The Company's billing system would require major modification or\n\n10              potential replacement in order to aggregate accounts depending on the\n\n11              number of accounts under the CGS program.                   Employee training on\n\n12              aggregation and the ultimate billing system will be required. The cost of\n\n13              any new billing system would have to be recovered from customers like\n\n14              any other implementation and administration cost for the CGS program.\n\n15              Moreover, certain provisions of this CGS program may require notification\n\n     11\n          /d.\n     12\n          Parties have agreed that it is reasonable at the outset of the CGS program to establish a cap\n          on the amount of load that may subscribe to CGS service. However, the parties have not\n          reached agreement on the amount of a cap beyond a range from 80 MW to 150 MW. See\n          Stipulation of Facts and Other Matters filed January 20, 2012 (Stipulation II.B. 1-2).\n     13\n          The Company is assuming that if aggregation were allowed, an aggregator would be required\n          to facilitate aggregation. The CGS product is a 24/7 firm product that requires the CGS\n          Supplier to acquire firm network service. Examples of the complications associated with\n          aggregation include: 1) if a customer who is part of a CGS aggregated group closes\n          business, does this result in the entire aggregated group's CGS contract being terminated\n          because the firm network resources no longer matches the aggregated groups CGS\n          capacity?; 2) how can, or should, customers be added to an aggregate group because this\n          would then exceed the existing CGS capacity and contracted firm network transmission\n          service?; 3) how can the requirement for IDR metering and backup metering for each CGS\n          Customer at their cost be fulfilled in the context of aggregation?; and 4) how would all such\n          CGS Customers be converted to calendar month billing?\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Lastly, as\n\n11           discussed above and as described in the parties January 20 Stipulated\n\n12           Matters and Stipulated Facts, this CGS program is extremely complicated.\n\n13           The Company therefore proposes that customers currently on either the\n\n14           Rider to Rate Schedule LIPS for Interruptible Service (\"Schedule IS\") or\n\n15           Economic As-Available Power Service (\"Schedule EAPS\") should not be\n\n16           allowed to participate in the CGS program to satisfy any portion of their\n\n17           firm load at this time.      Customers on Schedules IS and EAPS already\n\n18           have their loads split between firm and other service. Adding a further\n\n19           split of what was firm service between CGS and what then remains for\n\n20           firm service is a further complexity in billing and administration of the CGS\n\n21           program that should be considered at a future date, once the Company\n\n22           and its customers have the opportunity to gain experience in the basics of\n\n23           the CGS program. Again, the potential for expanding the CGS program to\n\f    Entergy Texas, Inc.                                               Page 23 of 23\n    Supplemental Direct Testimony of Phillip R.

Page 3 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1   A.     Mr. Nalepa and Mr. Pollock take the position that the Company is seeking\n\n 2          recovery of \"lost revenues,\" and that lost revenues are not the same as\n\n 3          unrecovered costs.\n\n 4\n\n 5   Q.     MR. POLLOCK (PP. 18-19) AND MR. NALEPA (P. 8) CLAIM THAT\n\n 6          COURT        AND      COMMISSION             PRECEDENTS      HAVE    ALREADY\n\n 7          REJECTED         THE     COMPANY'S           POSITION   IN   THIS    CASE    BY\n\n 8          CONCLUDING THAT UTILITIES ARE NOT ENTITLED UNDER PURA TO\n\n 9          RECOUP \"LOST REVENUES.\" WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE?\n\n10   A.     Mr. Nalepa does not provide any indication of what precedent he is\n\n11          referencing, so I am not in a position to respond to his contention. Mr.\n\n12          Pollock references several Commission proceedings dealing with the\n\n13          promulgation of the Commission's energy efficiency rule, and a court case\n\n14          reviewing certain aspects of that rule.         Mr. Pollock contends that these\n\n15          precedents establish a principle that references to recovery of costs in\n\n16          PURA do not contemplate recovery of lost revenues.\n\n17                  Before I turn to rebuttal of Mr. Pollock's suggestion, I note that\n\n18           neither the Commission Staff nor the SOAH ALJ who was the first\n\n19          impartial judge of these issues had any trouble concluding that ETI's\n\n20          proposal was for the recovery of unrecovered embedded production\n\n21          costs. The Staff, which has not indicated any change in position at this\n\n22          juncture, concluded: \"[i]mplementing the CGS tariff...              allows CGS\n\n23          customers to avoid certain generation-related costs, and therefore PURA\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                   Page 4 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R.

His analysis, however, is\n\n 8          irrelevant and off base because the Company in this proceeding seeks\n\n 9          only its statutory right to recoup the fixed production costs that it fails to\n\n10           recover when a customer chooses CGS service over firm LIPS service.\n\n11          The Company's production costs to serve all of its customers are\n\n12           determined in a base rate case based on a representative test year (most\n\n13           recently in Docket No. 37744), and every customer's share of those costs\n\n14           are likewise determined in that same case. The Company's production\n\n15           costs for the LIPS customers in Docket No. 37744 is $6.84/kW-month.\n\n16           When one of those customers moves to CGS service, the Company no\n\n17           longer recovers that $6.84 unit production cost from that customer; in the\n\n18           words of the CGS statute, that cost is \"unrecovered.\" Mr. Pollock points to\n\n19           the fact that ETI's proposed CGSUSC tariff uses the term \"lost revenues\"\n\n20           rather than \"unrecovered costs.\" This difference in terminology is of no\n\n\n     2\n         Docket No. 37744, Staff Reply to Exceptions at p. 3. .

Page 5 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          moment, however, because in terms of test year rate-setting principles, a\n\n 2          utility's revenue requirement and its cost of serving its customers are one\n\n 3          and the same.\n\n 4                  In the court of appeals case cited by Mr. Pollock, it appears that the\n\n 5          court determined that the utility could not recover lost revenues on top of\n\n 6          the energy efficiency program costs that were the focus on the statutory\n\n 7          provision governing energy efficiency cost recovery. 4 Here, by contrast,\n\n 8          ETI seeks only recovery of the production costs that a CGS customer\n\n 9          avoids paying when it takes CGS service.\n\n10                  In addition, the statute governing the CGS program is unique, and\n\n11          distinct from the energy efficiency statute, in that it prescribes that ETI is\n\n12          entitled to recoup costs that are unrecovered due to implementation of the\n\n13          CGS program, and requires that the implementation of the program not be\n\n14          treated as though a discount rate is being put in place.        Under PURA\n\n15          § 36.007, if a utility grants a discount rate, it must absorb the \"allocable\n\n16          cost of serving those customers ... \" who receive the discount.         If ETI\n\n17          cannot recover the production costs avoided by the CGS customer, it will\n\n18          absorb the portion of its production costs \"allocable\" to those customers,\n\n19          just as is required when a utility provides a customer with a discount rate.\n\n20          PURA § 39.452(b}, however, expressly prohibits the CGS program from\n\n21          producing this result.\n\n\n\n     4\n         See PURA § 39.905.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK'S DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC, HE\n\n 2          REFERS TO \"HYPOTHETICAL\" LOST REVENUES.                          IS THERE\n\n 3          ANYTHING            HYPOTHETICAL             ABOUT      THE     COMPANY'S\n\n4           UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n 5   A.     No. The Company's calculation of unrecovered costs is based on\n\n 6          embedded costs within the rate case establishing the CGS tariff as\n\n 7          prescribed by PURA § 39.452(b).              The only unknown is whether any\n\n 8          customers will actually apply for CGS service. Hence, the Company has\n\n 9          developed a $/kW rate associated with its known embedded costs that\n\n10          would be applied to actual CGS load as it occurs to determine the CGS\n\n11          unrecovered costs. There is nothing hypothetical about this cost. The\n\n12          same cannot be said for load growth, which may or may not occur in the\n\n13          future.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.     YOU MENTION LOAD GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.                        WHAT ABOUT\n\n16           LOAD GROWTH SINCE THE LAST RATE CASE?\n\n17   A.     The Company has already filed a new rate case. Any growth in load since\n\n18           rates were set in the last rate case (Docket No. 37744), along with any\n\n19          growth in cost. will be taken up in the rate new case (Docket No. 39896).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE LOAD GROWTH PROPOSALS MADE BY\n\n 3           THE OTHER PARTIES.\n\n 4   A.      Mr. Townsend recommends that unrecovered costs be reduced by any\n\n 5           increases in generation-related base rate revenues attributable to load\n\n 6           growth. 5 It appears that, under Mr. Townsend's approach, an allocation of\n\n 7           ETI's overall revenues from load growth would need to be made, yielding\n\n 8           the proportion of the growth reasonably attributable to the generation\n\n 9           function. Mr. Johnson recommends that unrecovered costs be offset by\n\n10           production revenue growth for the LIPS class only. 6\n\n11                   Similar to Mr. Townsend, Mr. Nalepa states that load growth \"from\n\n12           existing production-related rates charged to incremental load\" should form\n\n13           the basis for ETI to recover the production costs previously paid by the\n\n14           CGS customer?         Mr. Chriss makes no recommendation regarding load\n\n15           growth in Wai-Mart's February 10, 2012 direct testimony.                 Mr. Pollock\n\n16           suggests that ETI has experienced load growth that exceeds unrecovered\n\n17           costs and therefore there are no unrecovered costs. 8 For this discussion it\n\n18           appears that Mr. Pollock is utilizing total company growth for the\n\n\n     5\n          Townsend Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, pages 81ines 19-21.\n     6\n          Johnson Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, page 15, lines 5-7.\n     7\n          Nalepa Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, page 8, line 22 to page 9, lines\n          1-2.\n     8\n          Pollock Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, pages 21-24.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   \\0\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ARE      THERE        COMMON         FLAWS       IN   THE    LOAD     GROWTH\n\n5           RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INTERVENOR WITNESSES?\n\n6    A.     Yes, the intervenor witnesses uniformly ignore that ETI's unrecovered\n\n 7          costs (the embedded production costs associated with serving CGS\n\n 8          customers) are determined in a base rate case, using test year rate setting\n\n 9           principles, just like every other element of the Company non-fuel\n\n10           production costs.     The Commission does not consider incremental load\n\n11           growth or other incremental cost or revenue changes outside the rate year\n\n12           in establishing the rates that will recover ETI's fixed production costs for\n\n13           any other component of those costs.             There is no basis for taking a\n\n14           contrary approach in determining recovery of the embedded production\n\n15           costs associated with serving the CGS customers.             PURA § 39.452(b)\n\n16           confirms this view when it states that \"the utility's rates shall be set, in the\n\n17           proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs as a result\n\n18           of the implementation of the tariff.\"         The statute says nothing about\n\n19           considering a load growth adjustment that is unknown and unmeasurable\n\n20           as the Commission sets rates, in this case, to recover the production costs\n\n21           incurred to serve CGS customers.            Furthermore, even if the statute did\n\n22           refer to load growth, changes in costs to serve customers, not just growth\n\n23           in load, would also need to be considered.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 9 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n\n\n 1   Q.     ARE THERE ADDITIONAL FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN INTERVENOR\n\n 2          WITNESS LOAD GROWTH ANALYSES?\n\n 3          Yes, the intervenor witnesses' load growth recommendations are\n\n 4          fundamentally       flawed     for   additional   reasons.   All   of   these\n\n 5          recommendations assume, to one degree or another, that load growth\n\n 6          under base rates is to be devoted, in a preferential fashion, to subsidize\n\n 7          the CGS program. There is nothing in base ratesetting principles or in\n\n 8          PURA that supports this approach. Under PURA, absent special statutory\n\n 9          requirements to the contrary, base rates are to be set sufficient to\n\n10          providing the utility with a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable\n\n11          return over and above the recovery of its reasonable and necessary\n\n12          operating expenses.\n\n13                  Once those base rates are set, they are left in place until such time\n\n14          as they are changed again, on a prospective basis only. There is nothing\n\n15          in this process that earmarks load growth for a special purpose, such as\n\n16          subsidizing the CGS customers.\n\n17                  The Commission Staff has explicitly recognized this principle in this\n\n18          case. In its Exceptions to the ALJ's Proposal for Decision, ETI explained\n\n19          that devoting load growth to address unrecovered costs would prevent it\n\n20          from using such growth to address costs of operations it actually\n\n21          experienced while the rates were in effect. The Staff agreed, stating in its\n\n22          Replies to Exceptions that:\n\n\n                                                                                     \\I-\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ARE      YOU     AWARE        OF    OTHER          INSTANCES   IN   WHICH   THE\n\n10           COMMISSION HAS APPLIED TOTAL COMPANY OR GENERATION-\n\n11            RELATED REVENUE GROWTH AS AN OFFSET TO EMBEDDED\n\n12            HISTORICAL COSTS SUCH AS THE CGS CUSTOMER PRODUCTION\n\n13            COSTS?\n\n14   A.       No. As discussed in my Supplemental Direct Testimony, load growth has\n\n15           gained acceptance in Texas as a consideration in offsetting incremental\n\n16           costs, as in the provision for periodic adjustments for incremental changes\n\n17            in distribution investment, 10 but should not be used to provide a means for\n\n18           the non-recovery of embedded costs without consideration of incremental\n\n19           costs.\n\n20\n21   Q.       IF ONE ASSUMED, PURELY FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, THAT A\n\n22            GENERATION LOAD GROWTH ADJUSTMENT WERE APPROPRIATE\n\n23           TO OFFSET UNRECOVERED COSTS, IS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE\n\n\n\n\n     9\n          Staff Reply to Exceptions at p. 4 (emphasis added).\n     10\n          PURA Sec. 36.21 O(a)(2).\n\n\n                                                                                         \\~\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

No. If load growth from all customers classes associated with generation\n\n 4          revenues were used to offset the CGS unrecovered costs then: 1) this\n\n 5          load growth would not be available to offset incremental generation cost in\n\n 6          the context of the pending purchased power rulemaking; and 2) other\n\n 7          non-CGS classes of customers would be further subsidizing the CGS\n\n 8          program because load growth attributable to their classes would be used\n\n 9          to offset CGS unrecovered costs for a program that only benefits CGS\n\n10          participants.    Mr. Pollock's Exhibit JP-4 illustrates these problems.   His\n\n11          illustration shows that ETI' five-year projected load growth is 73.6 MW.\n\n12          But the load growth that he calculates is necessary to offset unrecovered\n\n13          costs (68.7 MW based on ETI's currently pending rate case) uses up\n\n14          virtually all the ETI projected load growth.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.     ON PAGE 16, MR. JOHNSON DISMISSES THE COMPANY'S USE OF\n\n17          THE EARNINGS MONITORING REPORT (\"EMR\") EARNED RETURN\n\n18          ON EQUITY (\"ROE\") AS AN INDICATION THAT LOAD GROWTH HAS\n\n19          NOT OFFSET INCREASED COSTS. PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n20   A.     Mr. Johnson at first states that this report is not indicative because it does\n\n21          not include the unrecovered costs of the CGS program (there are no CGS\n\n22          participants currently). First, this statement is inaccurate. The EMR does\n\n23          include the embedded production costs currently being used to satisfy\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

In addition, this statement\n\n 2           misses the Company's point. Regardless of the potential criticisms of a\n\n 3           particular EMR, it well illustrates the general concept that if the Company\n\n4            is not earning its allowed ROE, then the Company's non-fuel cost must\n\n 5           have increased at a faster rate than load and its associated revenues\n\n 6            have grown. The other parties continue to focus on growth in revenues\n\n 7           but ignore the fact that the Company's cost is also increasing.                     For\n\n 8           example, Mr. Pollock's Exhibit JP-2 indicates that adjusted energy sales\n\n 9            have increased by 5.9% in the two years between the test year in ETI's\n\n10            last rate case (the twelve months ending June 30, 2009) and the test year\n\n11            in the currently pending rate case (the twelve months ending June 30,\n\n12            2011). 11   ETI's non-fuel generation costs, however, have increased by\n\n13            28.6% in the same time frame. Load growth cannot be claimed or utilized\n\n14           to recover both incremental cost and embedded cost. 12 This would simply\n\n15            be double counting load growth.\n\n16                    Lastly Mr. Johnson indicates that the EMR is a general diagnostic\n\n17           tool and does not reflect all of the adjustments that would be made in the\n\n18            context of a rate case.         A general diagnostic tool is precisely how the\n\n19            Company utilized this report.          It provides a general indication that the\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          Pollock Exhibit JP-2, line 2, last column shows 5.9% increase in sales.\n     12\n          LIPS non-fuel generation revenue requirement of $65.251 million from Exhibit PRM-1, line 14\n          compared to $83.890 million from Exhibit PRM-2, line 3.

DO YOU AGREE?\n\n11   A.     No. In response to an RFI from OPUC, attached as Exhibit PRM-1 R, the\n\n12          Company responded to essentially this same question.          That response\n\n13          reflects the Company's intention on how CGS load would be treated in a\n\n14          future rate case proceeding.\n\n15                  Question:\n16                         Assuming that Mr. May's position is adopted with respect to\n17                  recovery of unrecovered costs, please explain how CGS\n18                  customers' billing determinants, demand and energy contributions\n19                  to class allocators, and revenues will be treated in future class cost\n20                  of service studies.\n21\n22                  Response:\n23                         Assuming Mr. May's position is adopted, including fully\n24                  compensatory recovery of unrecovered costs by ETI, CGS\n25                  customers' demand and energy contributions to class allocators will\n26                  be included in future class cost of service studies as if the CGS\n27                  program did not exist.

ON PAGE 22, MR. POLLOCK DISCUSSES THE AMOUNT OF LOAD\n\n5            GROWTH THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED. DO YOU HAVE ANY\n\n6            COMMENT?\n\n7    A.      Yes.   Mr. Pollock asks the Commission to simply assume that the load\n\n 8           growth forecast by ETI will in fact come to pass, although it is plainly not a\n\n 9           known or measurable event at this point.         Based on that speculative\n\n10           assumption, he asks the Commission to decree for now and ever after that\n\n11           ETI will have no unrecovered costs because load growth will outstrip\n\n12           them. This is an unreasonable and unsupportable assumption, to say the\n\n13           least, as Mr. Pollock's own exhibits demonstrate. The workpaper to Mr.\n\n14           Pollock's Exhibit JP-2 shows the actual known and measurable growth in\n\n15           ETI load over the period 1999 - 2009. Using that data, I have calculated\n\n16           the increase from each year to the year 2009, along with the compound\n\n17           annual growth for each year to 2009 as shown in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \\1\n\f    Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK DESCRIBES HIS BELIEF THAT\n\n 2          PROJECTED LOAD GROWTH MORE THAN OFFSETS ETI'S CLAIMED\n\n 3          \"LOST REVENUES.\" PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n 4   A.     Mr. Pollock simply assumes 150 MW of CGS customer load, then\n\n 5          estimates the unrecovered costs based on both values from Docket\n\n 6          No. 37744 and from Docket No. 39896 provided by the Company, then\n\n 7          backs into the amount of load growth that would be required to offset\n\n 8          these unrecovered costs based on the embedded production cost values\n\n 9          provided by the Company. This analysis exhibits several flaws. First, as\n\n10          discussed above, Mr. Pollock's example greatly overstates the amount of\n\n11          load growth that may reasonably be considered available to subsidize the\n\n12          CGS program.        A more reasonable allocation of load growth would be\n\n13          based on the percentage of load growth attributable to the LIPS class that\n\n14          should be determined to be the class eligible for the CGS program.\n\n15                  Second, Mr. Pollock's analysis fails to recognize the impact load\n\n16          growth has on MSS-1 payments and ETI's capacity purchases. As ETI's\n\n17          load increases, its responsibility ratio increases for MSS-1 purposes.\n\n18          Therefore, ETI becomes a \"shorter\" company and, as a result, incurs\n\n19           increased MSS-1 payments.             In addition, ETI will incur incremental\n\n20          capacity costs to serve this hypothesized load growth not currently\n\n21           reflected in the embedded cost rate assumed by Mr. Pollock. Thus, Mr.\n\n22           Polllock has overstated the effect load growth would have as an offset to\n\n23           unrecovered costs.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF SITUATIONS\n\n 2          WHERE HE HYPOTHESIZES THAT NEW LOAD ASSOCIATED WITH\n\n 3          CGS CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT RESULT IN UNRECOVEVRED\n\n 4          COSTS. PLEASE COMMENT.\n\n 5   A.     As discussed above and in my Supplemental Direct Testimony, PURA\n\n 6          provides that \"... [ETI's] rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the\n\n 7          tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the\n\n 8          implementation of the tariff.\"       As discussed in my Supplemental Direct\n\n 9          Testimony, new load is subject to the same average cost pricing as\n\n10          existing load.     Accordingly, in the normal course of events, new loads\n\n11          would pay their share of ETI's embedded production costs in the same\n\n12          manner as existing customers. Mr. Pollock's position assuming that these\n\n13          new customers would not have paid these costs absent the CGS program\n\n14          would require: 1) a decision by the Commission to treat a portion of ETI's\n\n15          new load differently from other new load not associated with the CGS\n\n16          program; and 2) would require credible proof that absent the CGS\n\n17          program, this load would never have been added to ETI's system. Absent\n\n18          this proof, this load is like any other new or existing load subject to\n\n19          average cost pricing.         Like much of Mr. Pollock's presentation, his\n\n20          scenarios are purely hypothetical and theoretical.          The facts and\n\n21          circumstances surrounding a new customer taking service from ETI, or an\n\n22          existing customer expanding its load, cannot be judged until such an event\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE PARTIES' POSITIONS REGARDING WHO\n\n 6           SHOULD PAY (OR BE ALLOCATED) THE CGS UNRECOVERED\n\n 7           COSTS.\n\n 8   A.      Mr. Townsend recommends that: 1) unrecovered costs should be\n\n 9           recovered from CGS participants, and if that option is not viable; 2) the\n\n10           CGS program should be rejected, and if that option is not selected;\n\n11           3) ETI's proposal to spread these costs across all classes is the most\n\n12           equitable (with certain modifications). 13 Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nalepa and Mr.\n\n13           Chriss recommend that the unrecovered costs should be recovered from\n\n14           the LIPS class of customers (both CGS participants and non-participants)\n\n15           because only the LIPS customers have an effective ability to participate in\n\n16           CGS and this is consistent with cost causation principles. 14 Mr. Pollock\n\n17           recommends that unrecovered costs (if any) should be recovered from\n\n18           CGS participants. 15      Mr. Pollock also suggests that if the unrecovered\n\n\n\n\n     13\n          Townsend Supplemental Direct Testimony, February 10, 2012, pages 3-4 and pages 7-8.\n     14\n          Johnson Supplemental Direct Testimony, page 6, line 16 to page 7, line 2.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THESE PROPOSALS.\n\n 5   A.       Ultimately the question of what class of customers should pay for\n\n 6            unrecovered costs is a policy decision to be made by the Commission.\n\n 7            One thing that is clear under PURA § 39.452(b) is that the Company is\n\n 8            allowed to recover its unrecovered costs: \"[ETI's] rates shall be set, in the\n\n 9            proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered\n\n10            as a result of the implementation of the tariff.\" 17 The statute, however,\n\n11            does not dictate a specific allocation of unrecovered costs among ETI's\n\n12            customers. The Company would not oppose any reasoned allocation of\n\n13            unrecovered costs to customer classes including CGS participants or CGS\n\n14            eligible customers. That said, it should be understood that any allocation\n\n15            of unrecovered costs will be temporary in nature.      Ultimately, when ETI\n\n16            files another base rate case, the effects of the CGS program would be\n\n17            reflected in the allocation of cost responsibility similar to the way that the\n\n18            Company now allocates the interruptible credit.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n          ld, page 38, lines 11-13.\n     17\n          PURA § 39.452(b).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK'S STATEMENT\n\n 2          THAT SHOULD THE UNRECOVERED COSTS BE SUBSTANTIAL\n\n 3          THERE          WILL    BE     INSUFFICIENT    BENEFITS      TO     JUSTIFY\n\n 4          IMPLEMENTING THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n 5   A.     There is no aspect of the CGS program, as described in PURA\n\n 6          § 39.452(b), hinting that unrecovered costs should be ignored in order to\n\n 7          heighten the chance of the program's success for those relatively few\n\n 8          customers positioned to take advantage of it.      To accept Mr. Pollock's\n\n 9          implicit invitation to do so would be nothing less than creating an\n\n10          impermissible discounted rate for CGS customers that is financed by the\n\n11          Company's absorption of the embedded production costs incurred to\n\n12          serve those customers. As stated in PURA § 39.452(b) and described in\n\n13          my Supplemental Direct Testimony, the CGS program may not result in\n\n14          the creation of such a discounted rate.       The Company is allowed to\n\n15          recover its unrecovered costs, and the CGS program is optional to\n\n16          customers.      Satisfaction of the statutory requirements applicable to the\n\n17          CGS program, not guaranteed success for a select few customers, should\n\n18          be the basis for evaluating the CGS program and tariffs.\n\n19\n\n20                   VI.

He\n\n13           appears to make these recommendations without regard to whether such\n\n14           customers have any interest in or ability to effectively participate in the\n\n15           program.

POLLOCK'S RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE\n\n     2           MINIMUM CGS SUPPLY CONTRACT SIZE AFFECT HIS OTHER\n\n     3           PROPOSALS REGARDING CUSTOMER ELIGIBILITY?\n\n     4   A       The minimum demand for LIPS service is 2.5 MW. Therefore, under Mr.\n\n     5           Pollock's own proposals (absent aggregation), the CGS program would\n\n     6           still have to be limited to the LIPS class of customers. Aggregation is the\n\n     7           only proposal made by Mr. Pollock that expands the eligibility beyond the\n\n     8           LIPS class of customers.\n\n     9\n\n    10   Q.      WHAT SUGGESTION DOES MR. POLLOCK MAKE REGARDING\n\n    11           AGGREGATION?\n\n    12   A.      Mr. Pollock makes two suggestions:          1) aggregation is not tied to retail\n\n    13           competition; and 2) aggregation is not complicated. 24\n\n    14\n\n    15   Q.      DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THESE TWO SUGGESTIONS?\n\n    16   A       Yes.    First, in attempting to support his claim that aggregation is not\n\n    17           complicated, Mr. Pollock uses an example that contradicts his argument\n\n    18           that aggregation is not a feature of retail competition. The only location\n\n    19           Mr. Pollock cites where aggregation was instituted to allow widespread\n\n    20           customer choice of alternative sources of electricity was in ERGOT.\n\n    21           There, of course, aggregation was expressly included as an element of\n\n\n\n         24\n              /d,pages 40-41.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                            Page 23 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           the introduction of retail competition. 25          PURA § 39.452(b) does not\n\n2            impose retail open access on ETI and its customers. As discussed in my\n\n3            Supplemental Direct Testimony, allowing aggregation of load to any\n\n4            customer class is the equivalent to retail open access in that any customer\n\n 5           can choose to aggregate its load with another and thereby select to have\n\n6            an alternative generation supplier.           In connection with the passage of\n\n 7           Senate Bill 7, the Commission spent several years, in numerous projects\n\n 8           and workshops, working with ERCOT and numerous stakeholders to\n\n 9           develop and implement the rules and mechanisms whereby service to a\n\n10           multitude    of    retail   customers       could   be   split   between   regulated\n\n11           Transmission and Distribution service and unregulated generation service.\n\n12           Similarly, ETI would need to be able to identify all the individual customers\n\n13           who decided to take part in aggregation, account for changes in the\n\n14           aggregate group, account for switches between aggregated and traditional\n\n15           service, etc. This Commission is well aware of the difficulties associated\n\n16           with implementing that type of program and, contrary to Mr. Pollock's\n\n17           suggestion, it is certainly complicated and not inexpensive.\n\n18\n\n19   Q.      ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROPOSALS FOR ELIGIBILITY MADE BY\n\n20           MR. POLLOCK?\n\n21   A.      Yes, Mr. Pollock also suggests that customers on LIPS who are also on\n\n22           Standby Maintenance Service (SMS) and Interruptible Service (IS) should\n\n     25\n          E.g, PURA § 39.353.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 24 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          be allowed to contract for CGS supply.               A LIPS customer typically\n\n 2          designates part, but not all, of its load to be served under these separate\n\n 3          rate schedules. SMS is a service that a customer may call on to back up\n\n4           its own co-generation supply under certain circumstances.          IS is a rate\n\n 5          whereby a customer who agrees to allow its service to be curtailed under\n\n 6          certain circumstances receives a bill credit for the load devoted to IS.\n\n 7\n 8   Q.     PLEASE RESPOND TO MR. POLLOCK'S CLAIM THAT CGS SERVICE\n\n 9          CAN READILY BE ADDED ON TOP OF CUSTOMERS ALREADY\n\n10          RECEVING         SERVICE       UNDER         THESE   MULTIPLE    RATES     AND\n\n11          SCHEDULES.\n\n12   A.     As discussed in my Supplemental Direct Testimony, this CGS program is\n\n13          extremely complicated: it will be the single most complicated billing and\n\n14          administration ever attempted on the Entergy system.             Therefore, the\n\n15          Company continues to propose that customers currently on either\n\n16          Schedule IS or Economic As-Available Power Service (EAPS) should not\n\n17           be allowed to participate in the CGS program to satisfy any portion of their\n\n18          firm load at this time.      Customers on Schedules IS and EAPS already\n\n19           have their loads split between firm and other service. Adding a further\n\n20          split of what was firm service between CGS and what then remains for\n\n21          firm service is a further complexity in billing and administration of the CGS\n\n22           program that may be considered at a future date, once the Company and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   Jl\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 25 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           its customers have the opportunity to gain experience in the basics of the\n\n 2           CGS program.\n\n 3                  Moreover, as explained in the Company's response to TIEC RFI\n\n 4           1-8 (attached as Exhibit PRM-2R), this limit on customer eligibility should\n\n 5           likewise extend to LIPS customers who also receive service under the\n\n 6           SMS rate schedule. 26 In that RFI response, ETI further explained that the\n\n 7           Company has a concern that customers on Schedule SMS may be able to\n\n 8           manipulate their own generation to avoid unserved energy charges\n\n 9           associated with a third-party CGS supplier. For example, a customer on\n\n10           SMS is receiving backup service for its own generation. It is possible that\n\n11           customer could utilize this backup service for its generation to instead\n\n12           backup generation from a third-party CGS supplier and thereby avoid\n\n13           unserved energy changes. For these reasons, and because of the same\n\n14           billing concerns applicable to EAPS and IS customers, the CGS tariff\n\n15           should be limited at this time to LIPS customers only.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.      DO YOU        HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENT ON THE CUSTOMER\n\n18           ELIGIBILITY ISSUE?\n\n19   A.      Yes. It makes little sense to extend eligibility for this type of experimental\n\n20           program to customer groups or classes who have shown no interest in\n\n21           participating. Even for the LIPS class of customers expanding CGS to IS,\n\n\n     26\n          SMS service is essentially backup service for a customer who serves its load from\n          co-generation facilities.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 26 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          EAPS and other optional rates makes little since when, as discussed\n\n 2          above, these customers have exhibited no interest in the program.\n\n 3\n\n 4                                    VII.    OTHER ISSUES\n\n 5   Q.     MR. NALEPA AND MR. POLLOCK CLAIM THAT THE FIXED COST\n\n 6          CONTRIBUTION FEE OF $1.10/KW PAID BY CGS PARTICIPANTS\n\n 7          FULLY RECOVERS THE PRODUCTION COST INCURRED BY THE\n\n 8          COMPANY TO SERVE CGS CUSTOMERS. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n 9   A.     No.    The production cost incurred by the Company to serve existing\n\n10          customers, who might migrate to CGS service, is its actual embedded\n\n11          production cost determined in the rate case from which the CGS program\n\n12          will be approved. That actual embedded production cost is the $6.84/kW\n\n13          resulting from Docket No. 37744 described in my Supplemental Direct\n\n14          Testimony and Exhibit PRM-1.             The only offsets to this unrecovered\n\n15          embedded production cost are the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee of\n\n16          $1.1 0/kW and the MSS-1 impact associated with System Agreement\n\n17          recognition of this capacity for MSS-1 purposes. There are no other actual\n\n18          offsets to the unrecovered embedded production costs.\n\n19                  Both Mr. Nalepa and Mr. Pollock would like to now claim that the\n\n20          $1.1 0/kW is associated with providing production service to CGS\n\n21          participants, or in the terms of Mr. Pollock: backup service. This is not the\n\n22          case. The Fixed Cost Contribution Fee has always been discussed as\n\n23          simply a method to reduce any unrecovered costs by having the CGS\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                          Page 27 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           participants pay a contribution to fixed cost.            Characterizing this as\n\n2            recovery of incremental production cost or backup service to serve CGS\n\n3            load is simply wrong.\n\n4\n\n 5   Q.      WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO MR. POLLOCK'S ARGUMENT THAT\n\n6            THE MSS-1 OFFSET IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE MEANS OF PLACING\n\n 7           A MARKET VALUE ON CGS CAPACITY?\n\n 8   A.      Mr. Pollock has completely missed the significance of the MSS-1 offset to\n\n 9           this case.    The reduction in ETI's MSS-1 payment, which is associated\n\n10           with equalizing reserves among the Entergy Operating Companies, is not\n\n11           being used as a proxy value for the CGS capacity, as claimed by\n\n12           Mr. Pollock. 27     The Company is simply recognizing that its MSS-1\n\n13           payments (or cost) will be reduced by recognition of the CGS capacity,\n\n14           and that this is the only known and measurable actual cost reduction\n\n15           attributable to the CGS program available to offset the unrecovered costs.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.      ON PAGE 28, MR. POLLOCK STATES THAT CGS CAPACITY IS AN\n\n18           INCREMENTAL NEW RESOURCE. WHAT IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE\n\n19           ON DETERMINATION OF UNRECOVERED COSTS?\n\n20   A.      As discussed by Company witness Dingle, CGS capacity may help the\n\n21           Company avoid acquiring some capacity in the future, although the ability\n\n22           of CGS capacity to create such a result is limited due to certain program\n\n     27\n          Pollock Supplemental Direct Testimony, page 28, lines 7-9.\n\n\n                                                                                         30\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                   Page 28 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          constraints such as the short-term nature of the CGS contract. However,\n\n 2          CGS capacity in no way avoids embedded capacity cost that the\n\n 3          Company has already incurred. Unrecovered embedded costs due to the\n\n 4          CGS program are none the less still unrecovered.        This is the case\n\n 5          whether or not the CGS capacity allows the Company to avoid any future\n\n 6          capacity costs.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q.     ON PAGE 14, MR. NALEPA CLAIMS THAT THE COMPANY IS\n\n 9          BENEFITING BY THE CGS PROGRAM. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n10   A.     No.    Mr. Nalepa claims that the Company will benefit from any MSS-1\n\n11          savings due to the added CGS capacity for MSS-1 purposes.                As\n\n12          described in my Supplemental Direct Testimony and discussed above,\n\n13          assuming the CGS capacity is firmed up, MSS-1 is being used to offset\n\n14          the unrecovered costs; thus, the Company is not keeping these benefits.\n\n15          Rather, the Company is giving these benefits to those customers who\n\n16          have to pay the unrecovered costs. The Company is simply complying\n\n17          with PURA in ensuring that it is no worse off due to implementation of the\n\n18          CGS program.\n\n19\n\n20   Q.     HOW CAN THE              COMPANY END         UP WORSE    OFF     DUE TO\n\n21          IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n22   A.     There are a number of ways. Examples include: 1) The Company's\n\n23          current rates were designed in Docket No. 37744 to recover the\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                    Page 29 of 30\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Phillip R. May\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          Company's embedded cost and provide for a reasonable return to\n\n2           stockholders based on the existing customers.      If those customers are\n\n 3          now provided an alternative supply, the Company no longer recovers the\n\n4           cost of its existing facilities, nor does it recover a return on those\n\n 5          investments; 2) the Company would not be allowed to fully recover its\n\n6           implementation and administration cost of the program; and 3) load growth\n\n 7          could be used as an offset to CGS unrecovered costs and in addition be\n\n 8          used as an offset to purchased power or production cost recovery in a\n\n 9          future ratemaking proceeding.\n\n10\n\n11   Q.     DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER GENERAL COMMENTS REGARDING THE\n\n12          CGS PROGRAM?\n\n13   A.     Yes. As the Company transitions to MISO, the CGS program will need to\n\n14          be redesigned for a number of reasons such as: 1) QF pricing under\n\n15          MISO will change; 2) the capacity market under MISO will be more\n\n16          transparent; 3) uncertainty of what the MISO capacity market will look like;\n\n17          4) QFs will have different options under MISO; and 5) ETI's options will be\n\n18          different under MISO. Based on these factors it can be anticipated that a\n\n19          revision to the CGS program as currently envisioned will be required in\n\n20          2013 as ETI and the other Entergy Operating Companies enter MISO.\n\f    Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME, BUSINESS ADDRESS, EMPLOYER AND\n\n 3           JOB TITLE.\n\n4    A       My name is Andrew J. O'Brien. My business address is Parkwood Two\n\n 5           Bldg., Suite 300, 10055 Grogan's Mill Road, The Woodlands, Texas\n\n 6           77380.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q.      BY WHOM ARE YOU EMPLOYED AND IN WHAT CAPACITY?\n\n 9   A        I am employed as Manager, Power Marketing by Entergy Services, Inc.,\n\n10           the service company affiliate providing engineering, planning, accounting,\n\n11           technical, regulatory support and other services to Entergy Texas, Inc.\n\n12           (\"ETI\" or the \"Company\") and the other Operating Companies of the\n\n13            Entergy System. 1 Although each individual Operating Company owns its\n\n14           generating resources and transmission assets, the Entergy System is\n\n15           planned and operated as a single, integrated system pursuant to the terms\n\n16            and conditions of the Entergy System Agreement. 2\n\n\n\n          The six Entergy Operating Companies are Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (\"EAI\"), Entergy Gulf\n          States Louisiana, L.L.C. (\"EGSL\"), Entergy Louisiana, LLC (\"ELL\"), Entergy Mississippi, Inc.\n          (\"EMI\"), Entergy Texas, Inc. (\"ETI\") and Entergy New Orleans, Inc. (\"ENOl\"). The electric\n          generation and bulk transmission assets of these six Operating Companies are operated on a\n          coordinated basis as a single electric system, referred to as the \"Entergy System\" or the\n          \"System.\"\n     2\n          The Entergy System Agreement is a FERC-approved rate schedule and contract entered into\n          among ESI and the Operating Companies, which requires the Operating Companies to plan,\n          construct and operate their electric generation and bulk transmission facilities as a single,\n          integrated electric system. It is administered by the Entergy Operating Committee. EAI and\n          EMI have provided notice to the other Operating Companies that they are terminating their\n          participation in the System Agreement effective December 2013 and November 2015,\n          respectively, or on such earlier dates as the FERC may permit.\n\f                                                                                Docket No. 38951\n                                                                               Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                              ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

During my career, I have\n\n 4          held numerous positions, including my current leadership position, in the\n\n 5          areas of commercial           negotiations,     regulatory,   generation dispatch\n\n 6          operations as well as resource and operations planning. In June, 2001, I\n\n 7          accepted a position as Next Day Scheduler in the power marketing\n\n 8          department of the Energy Management Organization (\"EMO\"). From 2003\n\n 9          to 2006, I worked as a Generation System Dispatcher and then as the Sr.\n\n10          Lead Analyst in the Current Day Operations group. In 2007, I accepted\n\n11          the role of Wholesale Executive in the Supply Procurement department\n\n12          and was promoted in 2008 to Manager, Supply Procurement. In this role,\n\n13              gained     significant    experience       negotiating     long-term     resource\n\n14          acquisitions, both asset purchases and purchase power agreements. In\n\n15          2010, I accepted a position within the EMO as Manager, Operations\n\n16          Support which is responsible for overseeing the development and\n\n17          implementation of the next-day resource plan including generation\n\n18          commitment and system load forecast.             In September 2011, I assumed\n\n19          the position of Manager, Power Marketing. I have a Masters Degree in\n\n20          Business Administration from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor of\n\n21          Science Degree in Psychology from Louisiana State University.\n\f                                                                         Docket No. 38951\n                                                                        Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                       ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

May's\n\n11          Supplemental Direct Testimony regarding the Competitive Generation\n\n12          Service (\"CGS\") program that is at issue in this proceeding. First, I explain\n\n13          that the value of capacity must consider many different factors related to\n\n14          the characteristics of the capacity product at issue and the market\n\n15          environment in which that capacity is being evaluated. As such, it is not\n\n16          feasible to assign some independent arbitrary value to the capacity that\n\n17          CGS Customers will use to supply their energy needs under the CGS\n\n18          Program.      I offer this explanation to support Company witness May's\n\n19          discussion of ETI's position regarding the appropriate definition and\n\n20          calculation of unrecovered costs. My explanation addresses the factors\n\n21          that must be considered when valuing capacity, and concludes that the\n\n22          characteristics of CGS capacity are associated with relatively low-value\n\n23          products.\n                                                                                             5\n\f                                                                                      Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                     Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                                    ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ASSESSING THE VALUE OF CGS CAPACITY\n\n 7   Q.       WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURCHASED CAPACITY\n\n 8            PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN ELEMENT OF THE\n\n 9            CGS PROGRAM?\n\n10   A.       My understanding is that the parties to this proceeding have been\n\n11            engaged in negotiations for some time aimed at achieving a collaborative\n\n12            resolution of a number of contested matters surrounding the design and\n\n13            implementation of the CGS Program. As further discussed by Company\n\n14            witness May, that negotiating process has resulted in a tentative proposal\n\n15            that purchased power supplied by a third party to ETI under the CGS\n\n16            Program may be counted as ETI's capacity (or, in the terminology of the\n\n17            Entergy System Agreement, \"capability\") by the Entergy System. 3 I will\n\n18            refer to this capacity product in my testimony as \"CGS Capacity\" and the\n\n\n     3\n          The parties to the case, including ETI, have not reached agreement on all matters necessary\n          to establish a CGS program that includes such a capacity product. Matters yet to be resolved\n          are listed in the \"Agreed List of Unsettled Issues and Issues Contingent on a Commission\n          Determination of Unsettled Issues\" filed on November 1, 2011. By providing this testimony,\n          ETI does not in any manner waive its rights to continue to fully contest any and all issues that\n          remain disputed among the parties. ETI presents this testimony solely for the purpose of\n          facilitating the Commission's resolution of the three threshold issues, which may facilitate\n          further efforts by the parties to resolve remaining contested issues surrounding the design of\n          the CGS program and tariffs.\n\f                                                                                   Docket No. 38951\n                                                                                  Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                                 ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                 Page 5 of 11\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1           contracts under which this capacity is supplied to the Entergy System as\n\n 2           \"CGS Purchase Agreement.\"\n\n 3                   As currently contemplated, when the CGS program goes into effect,\n\n4            the CGS Capacity would consist of an obligation on the part of the CGS\n\n 5           Supplier to deliver to ETI's transmission system a contractually-specified\n\n 6           amount of energy 24 hours per day, seven days per week (\"24/7\") on a\n\n 7           firm, unit-contingent basis. 4        ETI, however, will not make a capacity\n\n 8           payment to the CGS Supplier. Instead, ETI will pay the CGS Supplier for\n\n 9           the energy provided under the CGS Purchase Agreement at the avoided\n\n10           cost rate established under ETI's rate schedule LQF. The CGS Supplier\n\n11           would look to the CGS Customer, under a separate contract, for payment\n\n12           for the capacity provided to ETI.\n\n13\n\n14   Q.      CAN     ETI    UNAMBIGUOUSLY DETERMINE THE VALUE TO THE\n\n15           ENTERGY SYSTEM OF THE CAPACITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CGS\n\n16            PROGRAM?\n\n17   A.       No.   The value of any capacity purchase is a function of a number of\n\n18           different factors, including, for example, the operational characteristics of\n\n19           the capacity purchase, the location of that capacity, the term of the\n\n20           agreement, and the availability of other market alternatives. Moreover, it\n\n21            is difficult to assign discrete scores to these characteristics.             I am not\n\n     4\n          \"Unit Contingent\" means that so long as the CGS Supplier's generating unit is physically\n          capable of producing energy (or \"available\"), the CGS Supplier has the obligation to deliver\n          the contractually-specified amount of energy.\n\f                                                                         Docket No. 38951\n                                                                        Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                       ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

However, it is reasonable to consider how a specific\n\n4           capacity product ranks on a sliding scale of more or less valuable\n\n 5          according to each of the relevant characteristics, consider all of the\n\n6           characteristics collectively, and reach a conclusion about the relative value\n\n7           of a specific capacity product.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.     WOULD YOU PLEASE LIST SOME OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS,\n\n10          AND EXPLAIN HOW THEY APPLY TO CGS CAPACITY?\n\n11   A      Yes. The following Table 1 lists and describes some of the prominent\n\n12          characteristics that should be considered when evaluating capacity, and\n\n13           indicates where CGS capacity lies on the spectrum of more to less\n\n14          valuable.\n\f                                                                             Docket No. 38951\n                                                                            Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                           ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\nEntergy Texas, Inc.

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ETI'S CUSTOMERS, IS THERE ANY\n\n 7          VALUE THAT CAN BE ASCRIBED TO CGS CAPACITY?\n\n 8   A.     Yes. As discussed in more detail by Company witness May, the Entergy\n\n 9          Operating Committee has agreed to consider CGS Capacity as ETI\n\n10          capability for purposes of determining ETI's payment obligations pursuant\n\n11          to Service Schedule MSS-1 of the System Agreement, so long as CGS\n\n12           Capacity meets certain conditions imposed by the Operating Company.\n\n13          That treatment means that ETI's capacity costs will be decreased as a\n\n14           result of the CGS program.\n\f                   ~~   ---~-   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Docket\n                                                                           ----   No.\n                                                                                   - 38951\n                                                                                      -------.\n                                                                             Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                            ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT ASPECT OF THE ISSUES REGARDING ELIGIBILITY TO\n\n 3          PARTICIPATE IN THE CGS PROGRAM DO YOU ADDRESS?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> discuss the issue of whether it would be advisable to allow CGS\n\n 5          Customers to contract with CGS Suppliers for very small amounts of\n\n 6          capacity, thus permitting an opportunity for an increased amount of very\n\n 7          small CGS Purchase Agreements.\n\n 8\n\n 9   Q.     WHAT IS ETI'S POSITION ON THIS ISSUE?\n\n10   A.     ETI's position is that a CGS Customer should not be permitted to contract\n\n11          with a CGS Supplier for a level of capacity less than 10 MW.\n\n12          Furthermore, for the reasons explained by Company witness May,\n\n13          customers should not be allowed to aggregate their load for purposes of\n\n14          contracting for CGS supply. As a result of these conditions, eligibility to\n\n15          participate in the CGS program would be limited to customers who can\n\n16          individually contract for at least 10 MW of CGS Capacity.\n\n17\n\n18   Q.     ARE THERE OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE\n\n19           IMPOSITION              OF    A   10   MW     FLOOR     FOR    PARTICIPATING\n\n20          CUSTOMERS?\n\n21   A.     Yes. From an operational perspective, the key factor is not the size of the\n\n22          contracts with CGS Suppliers, but is instead the number of CGS\n\n23          Suppliers.            From time to time, especially in emergency situations or in\n\n                                                                                            ll\n\f                                                                             Docket No. 38951\n                                                                            Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                           ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                         Page 10 of 11\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          situations in which the transmission system operator calls for curtailments\n\n 2          to alleviate transmission constraints, the System's dispatchers must reach\n\n 3          out and provide instructions to each Purchased Power Agreement (\"PPA\")\n\n 4          counterparty. That process grows more difficult as the number of PPAs\n\n 5          increases. Currently, the parties to the CGS proceeding have reached a\n\n 6          tentative agreement in principle that the total amount of customer load\n\n 7          should be capped at somewhere between 80 and 150 MW, although there\n\n 8          is no specific agreement regarding the specific cap level within that range.\n\n 9          This cap, combined with a minimum size of 10 MW, would limit the\n\n10          number of potential CGS Purchase Agreements to 8 to 15, a number that\n\n11          should be able to be reasonably accommodated.\n\n12                  From     an   administrative     and   operational   perspective,   when\n\n13          managing load on the System, the System dispatchers must undertake\n\n14          the same procedures regardless of the size of the contract.            Thus, for\n\n15          example, the same notification procedures are used to pursue the\n\n16          reduction of a 10 MW resource as are used for a 100 MW resource during\n\n17          a low load event. The lower the MW limit for participation in the CGS\n\n18          program, the more likely that the administrative burden exceeds the\n\n19          benefit provided by the resource during emergencies such a low load\n\n20          events.      Further, the value of lower capacity level PPAs is less.\n\n21          Continuing with the example of the management of low load events, in the\n\n22          case of the 10 MW and 100 MW PPAs, when having to manage a low\n\n23          load event, the ability to turn down 100 MW provides substantially greater\n\f                                                                     Docket No. 38951\n                                                                    Entergy CGS Tariff\n                                                                   ETI EXHIBIT NO. 93\n    Entergy Texas, Inc.

In general,\n\n2          given the size of the load on the Entergy System, contracts as small as 10\n\n3          MW simply do not provide the same capacity value as larger PPAs, and in\n\n4          the absence of special programs, such as CGS, that are entered into for\n\n5          specific reasons, the System would not generally contract for such small\n\n6          amounts.\n\n7\n\n8   Q.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR REBUTTAL TESTIMONY?\n\n11   A          I will address certain comments and recommendations made by Texas\n\n12              Industrial Energy Consumers witness Jeffry Pollock regarding my Direct\n\n13              Testimony.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.         MR. POLLOCK CONCLUDES THAT YOUR TESTIMONY SHOULD BE\n\n16              GIVEN LITTLE WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT COMPARED THE\n\n17              VALUE OF CGS POWER (CAPACITY) TO ETI'S EXISTING\n\n18              PURCHASE POWER CONTRACTS. 1 HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n19   A          Nothing in my Direct Testimony required an analysis or comparison\n\n20              between hypothetical CGS Purchase Agreements and ETI's actual PPAs.\n\n21              Mr. Pollock's contention is inappropriate given that there are no CGS\n\n     1\n         Pollock Direct, p. 30, Ins. 8 - 10.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          2\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                               Page 2 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             Purchase Agreements. As noted in my Direct Testimony, there is no way\n\n2              to unambiguously determine at this time the value to the Entergy System\n\n 3             of CGS Capacity to be acquired in the future.              The value or price of\n\n4              capacity is determined based on considerations and circumstances\n\n 5             existing at the time a decision is made to acquire capacity, as well as the\n\n 6              process employed, such as, for instance, a Request for Proposal, which\n\n 7              relies on competitive bidding.          Additionally, unlike energy transactions,\n\n 8             there are no pre-existing capacity markets or indices to consult when\n\n 9              purchasing capacity.          With that understanding, the point of my Direct\n\n10             Testimony was simple; namely, that the value of purchased capacity is a\n\n11              function of a number of different factors or attributes; that,                 as\n\n12              contemplated, CGS Capacity ranks relatively low for five of seven major\n\n13              attributes; and that, accordingly, CGS Capacity \"is not a product that\n\n14              would reasonably be expected to have a high level of value.\" 2\n\n15\n16   Q.         MR. POLLOCK CONTENDS THAT A BASE-LOAD PRODUCT DOES\n\n17              NOT      NEED         FLEXIBILITY. 3      DOES    THAT     UNDERMINE       YOUR\n\n18              CONCLUSION REGARDING THE LOW VALUE OF CGS CAPACITY?\n\n19   A.         No. While an inflexible product may be able to provide a base-load role,\n\n20              flexibility is expected to add value to the resource, even if the resource\n\n21              may also         be    used to    provide a base-load       role.

Page 3 of7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             notwithstanding ETI's base-load deficit, ETI still places a value on flexible\n\n 2             capacity.     The current 2011 Western Region RFP, which seeks to fill a\n\n 3             long-term capacity need for ETI, makes clear that flexibility is preferred:\n\n 4                      Resources supplying flexibility offer benefits to Entergy\n 5                      Texas and the Entergy System that resources with less\n 6                      flexible or inflexible scheduling and dispatch capabilities\n 7                      cannot provide. Bidders are advised that these benefits will\n 8                      be captured quantitatively and qualitatively in the evaluation\n 9                      of proposals and ... will result in, all else being equal, a\n10                      preference for Flexible Capacity over Baseload Capacity\n11                      resources. 4\n12\n13             Further, Mr. Pollock's observation regarding the ability of the Entergy\n\n14             System Operator to order the CGS Supplier to curtail or not operate during\n\n15             System emergencies misses the mark. 5              The referenced emergency\n\n16             curtailment rights do not provide, and are notably different from, the right\n\n17             and ability to adjust the output of a resource to respond to dynamic\n\n18             changes in load, which is the valuable \"flexibility\" I discuss in my Direct\n\n19             Testimony.\n\n20\n\n21   Q.        MR. POLLOCK CONTENDS THAT THE PROSPECT OF PAYING\n\n22              UNSERVED ENERGY FOR LACK OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD\n\n23             ADDRESS ANY FIRMNESS CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE\n\n\n\n\n     4\n         2011 Western Region Request for Proposals for Long-Term Supply Side Resources, p. 7.\n     5\n         Pollock Direct, p. 31, Ins 6- 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 4 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             UNIT-CONTINGENT                NATURE      OF   THE   CGS   PURCHASE\n\n 2             AGREEEMENT. 6 DO YOU AGREE?\n\n 3   A.        No. CGS Suppliers must be Qualified Facilities (\"QFs\") connected to\n\n4              the ETI System. My low ranking on \"firmness\" relates to the reality\n\n 5             that many factors affect the firmness of a resource. Among these\n\n 6             factors would be the number of units providing service. Most QFs\n\n 7             consists of a single generating unit, rather than a system or fleet of\n\n 8             generating resources.           Regardless of economic motivation, the\n\n 9             reliability of supply, or firmness, is proportional to the number of units\n\n10             providing service. It follows that a unit-contingent product is less firm\n\n11             than a \"system\"-contingent product.             As noted in my Direct\n\n12             Testimony, the fact that a CGS (QF) Supplier has the primary\n\n13             obligation to serve a host load further reduces the firmness of\n\n14             supply.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.         PLEASE COMMENT ON MR POLLOCK'S OBSERVATION WITH\n\n17              REGARD TO HIS EXHIBIT JP-7 THAT ETI HAS ENTERED INTO\n\n18              NUMEROUS               UNIT   CONTINGENT        PURCHASED       POWER\n\n\n\n\n     6\n         Pollock Direct, p. 31, Ins 9 - 16.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             5\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 5 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n\n 1             AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS WITH TERMS AS\n\n 2              SHORT AS ONE TO THREE YEARS. 7\n\n 3   A.         All of the contracts listed in Exhibit JP-7 are distinguishable from the\n\n4               contemplated CGS Purchase Agreements, and, as such, Exhibit\n\n 5             JP-7 actually makes the point made in my Direct Testimony. Each\n\n 6              of the contracts listed in the Exhibit provide one or more attributes\n\n 7             that will not be provided by a CGS Purchase Agreement.                For\n\n 8              instance, certain of the contracts are for a level of capacity (MW)\n\n 9              greater than 150 MW. A number of the contracts provide flexibility.\n\n10              Others provide a term longer than five years.        Put another way,\n\n11              unlike the contracts that would result from the CGS program, none of\n\n12              the contracts listed in the Exhibit provide a low level of inflexible,\n\n13              short-term capacity from a resource that Entergy does not control.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.         MR. POLLOCK IS PROPOSING A LOWER LIMIT OF 5 MW\n\n16              RATHER THAN THE 10 MW YOU PROPOSED.                      COULD YOU\n\n17              CONSIDER SUPPORTING A 5 MW LIMIT? 8\n\n18   A.         Yes, my Direct Testimony was clear that the concern is not the size\n\n19              of the contracts with CGS Suppliers, but is instead the number of\n\n\n     7\n         Pollock Direct, p. 32, lines 1 - 5.\n     8\n         Pollock Direct, pp. 32 and 43.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            6\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 6 of 7\n     Supplemental Direct Testimony of Andrew J. O'Brien\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1             CGS Suppliers. I should also add that the number of CGS contracts\n\n 2             is a concern. As noted in my Direct Testimony, the lower the floor\n\n 3             for participation, the greater the opportunity for more suppliers and\n\n4              more contracts at a smaller capacity size, which, as noted in my\n\n 5             Direct Testimony, can raise cost-benefit concerns. In the event the\n\n 6             Commission determined to permit 5 MW contracts, ETI may seek a\n\n 7             limitation on the number of contracts, depending on the ultimate\n\n 8             level of participation. 9\n\n 9\n\n10   Q.        DOES THE FACT THAT ETI'S SERVICE AREA IS WITHIN THE\n\n11             WOTAB         PLANNING        REGION,      A   CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED\n\n12             REGION,         CAUSE        YOU   TO      RECONSIDER     YOUR       LOW\n\n13             \"LOCATION\" RANKING FOR CGS CAPACITY. 10\n\n14   A.        No. My ranking attributes some value for \"location\" to CGS Capacity,\n\n15             which reflects Mr. Pollock's observation that ETI is within WOTAB;\n\n16             however, the relatively low ranking also reflects that all but one QF is\n\n17             located outside of Entergy's Western Region (generally the region\n\n18             within the ETI area that is west of the Trinity River), which has a\n\n19             greater need for capacity than other areas within WOTAB.\n\n     9\n      Based on the contemplated cap of 150 MW for the CGS Program and ETI's recommended 10\n     MW lower contract limit, the maximum number of contracts would be 15.\n     10\n          Pollock Direct, p. 33, Ins 4-7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             7\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WOULD           YOU     PLEASE         COMMENT             ON   THE   ISSUE      OF\n\n 2             AGGREGATION?\n\n 3   A.        Mr. Pollock acknowledges that he has not conducted a study of the\n\n4              operational, billing or customer support ramifications that might be\n\n 5             associated with aggregation. 11 Neither can ETI warrant that there\n\n 6             would be no difficulties, including those that might be prohibitive,\n\n7              related to ETI's supply, planning and operational responsibilities,\n\n 8             were      the    CGS       program          to   include   aggregation.      These\n\n 9             considerations suggest that any CGS program, if implemented,\n\n10             should not include aggregation.\n\n11\n\n12                                         II.

CGS CAPACITY AND ETI'S CAPACITY DEFICIT\n\n 9   Q.       WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF MR. POLLOCK'S CONTENTION WITH\n\n10            RESPECT TO CGS CAPACITY AND ETI'S CAPACITY DEFICIT?\n\n11   A.       Mr. Pollock contends that CGS Capacity can reduce ETI's capacity deficit, and,\n\n12            in particular, ETI's base-load capacity deficit. 5 He bases this conclusion on the\n\n13            following provisions included in the tentative proposal under consideration by the\n\n14            parties and described in the Supplemental Direct Testimony of Company\n\n15            witnesses Phillip R. May and Andrew J. O'Brien:\n\n16                    •   A CGS Supplier must enter into a contract (\"CGS Purchase\n\n17                        Agreement\") with ETI to provide CGS capacity on a 7X24 basis, except\n\n18                        when the supplier's resource is not physically available;\n\n19                    •   The CGS Supplier must obtain the status of a network resource under\n\n20                        Entergy's OATT for the duration of the proposed CGS Purchase\n\n21                        Agreement (which must also correspond with the term of the contract\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          Pollock Direct at 13, 24-25.\n\n\n\n                                                       007\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                          Page 6 of 26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1                        between the CGS Supplier and the CGS Customer (\"Customer-\n\n 2                        Supplier Contract\"). 6\n\n 3                    •   If the above conditions are met, and all remaining issues are resolved,\n\n 4                        the Entergy Operating Committee 7 has indicated that CGS Capacity\n\n 5                        can be treated as capacity that is allocated to ETI.\n\n 6\n\n 7           Mr. Pollock implicitly concludes that because of these attributes - the 7X24\n\n 8           delivery obligation in particular - CGS Capacity should be considered a \"base\n\n 9           load\" resource for the Entergy System.               He further notes that because the\n\n10           Entergy System's 2009 Strategic Resource Plan (\"SRP\") Refresh reflects a\n\n11           capacity deficit and, in particular, a base-load deficit of 969 MW for ETI, 8 CGS\n\n12           Capacity \"would provide the utility much needed base-load capacity\" and \"can\n\n13           offset ETI's projected base-load capacity deficit.\" 9\n\n\n\n     6\n         Pollock Direct at 25. Mr. Pollock also states that the CGS supplier must achieve a minimum 80%\n         capacity factor measured during on-peak hours. (Pollock, Page 12, line 11) Actually, as a 7X24\n         product, CGS Purchase Agreement requires the Supplier to provide energy at the contracted MW\n         level every hour that the facility is available. Mr. Pollock reference is to the economic consequence\n         associated with an increase in demand payment if the Supplier fails to provide energy at the\n         contracted level during 80% of the on-peak hours. Mr. Pollock further states at Page 25, Footnote 9\n         that \"several of ETI's Purchased Power Agreements obligate ETI (and not the seller) to obtain\n         network transmission service. To clarify, there is no relevance to this observation, which speaks only\n         to the process by which transmission service is obtained for a potential System resource. For\n         instance, even under the proposed CGS program, ESI, on behalf of ETI, will be making application for\n         network service for the CGS Purchase Agreement. The fact that ETI (or ESI, on behalf of ETI), takes\n         responsibility for the application process does not change the requirement that the resource must be\n         qualified as a network resource.\n     7\n         The Entergy Operating Committee is the entity responsible for administering the Entergy System\n         Agreement, a FERC-filed rate schedule that governs the coordinated planning and operations of the\n         Entergy System.\n     8\n         Note that the Entergy System prepared periodic updates of its SRP; subsequent SRPs will reflect a\n         different base load deficit than that shown in the 2009 SRP Refresh as a result of changes in load\n         growth or resource additions/retirements.\n     9\n         Pollock Direct, p. 13, Ins 1-8.\n\n\n\n                                                        008\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

ARE      THERE       FUNDAMENTAL           RESOURCE     PLANNING       PRINCIPLES\n\n 2          RELEVANT TO THE EVALUATION OF MR. POLLOCK'S CLAIMS?\n\n 3   A.     Yes. As an initial observation, it is somewhat irrelevant to discuss \"ETI's base\n\n 4          load resource need\" outside of the context of the System Agreement.              The\n\n 5          System Agreement requires that all of the System's resources are planned\n\n 6          collectively for the mutual benefit of all of the System's load, and the allocation of\n\n 7          any new resources is a decision that is made after System-wide resource\n\n 8          acquisition issues are addressed. That said, the starting point for the System's\n\n 9          resource planning is its load forecast, meaning the demand (MW) and energy\n\n10          (MWh) that the System's resources must serve over various planning horizons.\n\n11          Based on that load forecast, the System then plans for the acquisition of\n\n12          resources necessary to economically and reliably meet the load over the same\n\n13          planning horizons.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.     WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THE CGS PROGRAM\n\n16          WILL AFFECT PLANS TO SERVE LOAD PARTICIPATING IN THE CGS\n\n17          PROGRAM?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">t is uncertain how a CGS customer's load will ultimately be treated for planning\n\n19          purposes, or whether that treatment will change over time as ETI gains\n\n20          experience with the program. Having said that, it is my understanding that, at\n\n21          least initially, a customer's participation in the CGS program will not affect ETI's\n\n22          plan to serve the portion of a customer's load associated with CGS Capacity\n\n\n\n\n                                                     009\n\f--   ---   --~-~~-----~\n\n\n\n\n                Entergy Texas, Inc.

Stephen Dingle\n                Docket No. 38951\n\n            1            (\"CGS Load\"). 10 Through the CGS program, a customer's load will be served via\n\n            2            energy that flows through the meter, and as such will be included in the load that\n\n            3            ETI is obligated to serve.\n\n            4\n\n            5   a.       WILL CGS CAPACITY REDUCE LONG TERM RESOURCE NEEDS?\n\n            6   A.       No. The program, as it is currently defined, will not provide long-term resources\n\n            7            to meet projected resource needs.               The limited term nature of the proposed\n\n            8            agreements, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the future continuation of the\n\n            9            program, do not provide sufficient assurance that CGS resources will be\n\n           10            available to meet Ell's long-term resource needs.                   Furthermore, the program\n\n           11            does not relieve ETI of its obligation to serve CGS customers in the event that\n\n           12            providers withdraw or fail to renew under the program.                      Ultimately, the CGS\n\n           13            program is at best a limited-term alternative that could defer or displace short-\n\n           14            and limited-term PPAs, but it in no way can be considered a long-term resource\n\n           15            option or affect ETI's long-term acquisition strategy.\n\n           16                    Because of its characteristics, CGS Capacity could possibly defer or\n\n           17            displace the acquisition of new short- and limited-term Purchased Power\n\n           18            Agreements (\"PPA\") that ETI might otherwise acquire, but would not defer or\n\n           19            displace the acquisition of long-term capacity.

EVEN ASSUMING THAT A CGS PURCHASE AGREEMENT HAS BASE-LOAD\n\n 5          RESOURCE CHARACTERISTICS, IS IT CORRECT TO CONCLUDE THAT\n\n 6          CGS CAPACITY REDUCES ETI'S BASE LOAD DEFICIT?\n\n 7   A.     Not necessarily. First, there is no reduction in the existing base-load capacity\n\n 8          deficit with respect to a CGS Purchase Agreement associated with new ETIIoad.\n\n 9          In that case, the CGS Capacity is added only for the purpose of serving the\n\n10          additional load contractually associated with the CGS Capacity and, so, as\n\n11          discussed above, there is no additional capacity available to reduce ETI's\n\n12          base-load capacity deficit or any of ETI's capacity deficits for that matter.\n\n13                  Additionally, even though it will become a System capacity resource with\n\n14          certain base-load characteristics, a CGS Purchase Agreement does not provide\n\n15          capacity and associated energy to the System in the same way as other base-\n\n16          load resources. A CGS Purchase Agreement is contractually linked to a specific\n\n17          CGS Customer and has been acquired only because of the load of that\n\n18          Customer. Moreover, the System can only rely on the CGS Supply as a firm\n\n19          resource so long as that contractual relationship between the CGS Customer and\n\n20          the CGS Supplier remains in place.              This relationship creates additional\n\n21          complexities within the resource planning process, because it adds additional\n\n22          uncertainty to future supply and demand.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     011\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK'S CLAIM THAT CGS CAPACITY\n\n2            REFLECTS A CAPACITY BENEFIT COMPARABLE TO $6.66 PER t<m-\n\n3            MONTH?11\n\n4    A.      Mr. Pollock glosses over the fundamental interrelationship between capacity cost\n\n 5           and energy cost.        It is difficult to consider one without the other.           Typically,\n\n6            resource planners are willing to pay high capacity costs for units that have a low\n\n 7           variable cost - so long as those units can be run in a base-load role - because\n\n 8           over the course of a year the high fixed cost can be spread over a large number\n\n 9           of MWh of generation, and the \"all-in• cost, or the sum total of the amortized foced\n\n10           cost and the variable (fuel) cost should be relatively low. On the other hand, all\n\n11           things equal, planners are not willing to pay a high capital cost for a resource that\n\n12           will be called on to run only a few hours a year. For example, a nuclear unit\n\n13           tends to have a high capacity cost and a low c-=cost, while a peaker like a\n\n14           combustion turbine typically has a low fixed capital cost and relatively high\n\n15           energy cost. In fact, the Entergy System has recently purchased high-heat rate\n\n16           peaking contracts for a capacity payment of less than $1/kW/month.                         CGS\n\n17           capacity is a unique product - even though ETI will not pay the CGS Supplier\n\n18           any direct capacity payment, ETI will pay the CGS Supplier its avoided energy\n\n19           cost, which will never be as low as the cost of energy from the System's nuclear\n\n20           units, and may at some times be equal to the cost of peaking energy. 12\n\n\n     11\n          Pollock Direct at 26-27.\n     12\n          Mr. Pollock also seems to suggest that there will be no energy costs to other customers, because the\n          energy cost will be offset by an energy credit. That is an over-simplified argument that ignores the\n          actual mechanics of the PUCT's fiXed fuel factor, fuel surcharge/refund, and fuel reconciliation\n          processes.\n\f-        ---~~~~\n\n\n\n\n         Entergy Texas, Inc.

THE VALUE OF CGS CAPACITY DOES NOT REDUCE EMBEDDED COSTS\n\n     2   Q.       DOES MR. POLLOCK CLAIM THAT THE CGS CAPACITY DISPLACES ANY\n\n     3            OF ETI'S EXISTING RESOURCES?\n\n     4   A        Mr. Pollock does not expressly make that claim; however, several of his\n\n     5            statements indicate his recognition that CGS Capacity would not displace any\n\n     6            existing resources.      He states that \"CGS can offset ETI's projected base-load\n\n     7            capacity deficit.\" 13   He also purports to explain \"how the CGS program could\n\n     8            potentially offset the need for new base-load capacity.\" 14             In his discussion of\n\n     9            \"other offsetting cost savings,\" he argues that the CGS program results in\n\n    10            capacity available to the Entergy System that \"ETI will not have to procure,\" and,\n\n    11            in turn, ETI can \"defer or displace additional generation capacity that would be\n\n    12            needed to maintain reliable service.\" 15 Additionally, as mentioned, Mr. Pollock\n\n    13            notes that the 2009 Entergy SRP Refresh reflects a deficit for ETI that is\n\n    14            substantially greater than the 150 MW maximum cap initially proposed for the\n\n    15            CGS program. Even assuming that the entire 150 MW was subscribed under the\n\n    16            CGS program, ETI would still have a capacity need greater than all of its existing\n\n    17            resources.\n\n\n\n\n         13\n              Pollock Direct at 13 (emphasis added).\n         14\n              Pollock Direct at 25 (emphasis added). The discussion of this issue in Mr. Pollock's deposition also\n              indicates that the acquisition of CGS Capacity can only affect future resource decisions (the costs\n              associated with those decisions) made after the acquisition of CGS capacity.

Page 12 of 26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1   Q.       WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF MR. POLLOCK'S RECOGNITION THAT CGS\n\n 2            CAPACITY DOES NOT DISPLACE ETI'S EXISTING CAPACITY?\n\n 3   A.       Company witness. May, in his Supplemental Direct Testimony (January 26,\n\n 4            2012), explained that ETI is seeking recovery of \"unrecovered costs\" which the\n\n 5            Company has defined as its embedded generation costs, 16 and that an offset to\n\n 6            these costs is appropriate only if the CGS program results in an actual reduction\n\n 7            to ETI's revenue requirement associated with those embedded costs. \"17 The\n\n 8            embedded costs Mr. May addresses are those caused by ETI's existing\n\n 9            generation resources. The recognition that the CGS program will not result in the\n\n10            displacement of existing resources is a tacit recognition that the program will not\n\n11            reduce the Company's embedded costs left unrecovered by a customer's\n\n12            participation in the program. As Mr. May notes, the only appropriate credits to\n\n13            unrecovered costs are those associated with a reduction in the Company's\n\n14            MSS-1 costs, the Fixed Cost contribution Fee, and the Unserved Energy O&M\n\n15            adder charges.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.       REGARDLESS OF THE VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMING UP CAPACITY,\n\n18            IS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE THAT VALUE TO REDUCE EMBEDDED\n\n19            CAPACITY COSTS?\n\n20   A.       No. To the extent that there is any intrinsic value to be gained by firming up the\n\n21            QF puts (a claim that I rebut in the following section of my testimony), any such\n\n22            value will be largely, if not exclusively, realized through lower fuel costs.

POLLOCK CLAIM THAT THE CGS PROGRAM CAN OFFSET\n\n     12            SOME OF THE COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE CAPABILITY?\n\n     13   A.       Yes. On page 36 of his Supplemental Direct testimony, Mr. Pollock asserts that:\n\n     14                    Firming up 150 MW of QF Puts will reduce the costs associated\n     15                    with flexible capacity [sic]. Based on a review of various studies\n     16                    presented in recent filings, I believe $2 million per year would be a\n     17                    conservative estimate of lower operating costs.\n\n     18            The calculations that Mr. Pollock used to derive this $2 million \"conservative\n\n     19            estimate\" was provided to the Company in a workpaper entitled \"CGS Operating\n\n     20            Cost Benefits.\" I have reproduced Mr. Pollock's calculations from that workpaper\n\n     21            in the following Table 1, although I have also added row numbers and a brief\n\n     22            description of the rows:\n\n\n\n          18\n               Rough Draft of Telephonic Deposition of Jeffry Pollock, dated February 22, 2012 (\"Pollock Depo\") at\n               46.

Mr. Pollock\n\n 5            claims to use two different studies as sources of the quantification of the value of\n\n 6            flexible capability:                          (1) the Cost-Benefit Analyses (\"CBA\") that Charles River\n\n 7            Associates (\"CRA\") developed to assess the potential benefits that might occur if\n\n 8            the Entergy Operating Companies were to join a Regional Transmission\n\n 9            Organization (\"RTO\") and (2) the modeling that Entergy Services prepared to\n\n10            support discussions regarding the Commitment, Operations and Dispatch\n\n11            Agreement (\"CODA\") that was, at one time, a potential successor arrangement to\n\n12            the Entergy System Agreement.                                                Mr. Pollock's analysis is based on a\n\n13            fundamental misinterpretation of the methodology and results of both of those\n\n14            studies, such that his estimates have no meaning whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     016\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Mr.\n\n2           Pollock also calculated a value that he labeled \"Percent Affected: which he\n\n3           asserts represents the percentage of the QF puts that would be firmed up under\n\n4           the CGS program.          However, Mr. Pollock's calculation of Percent Affected\n\n5           grossly overstates the amount of QF puts that would be firmed up as a\n\n6           percentage of the total puts. Mr. Pollock then compounds the error by incorrectly\n\n7           applying the \"Percent Affected\" to ETI's total annual sales to determine his\n\n 8          estimate of the potential operating benefit. I will discuss each error in tum.\n\n 9\n\n10   Q.     WHAT ARE THE CRA CBAs?\n\n11   A.     The CRA CBAs are a series of studies that evaluate the costs and benefits that\n\n12          might inure to ratepayers if one or more of the Entergy Operating Companies\n\n13          were to join one of two Regional Transmission Organizations (\"RTO\"):              the\n\n14          Southwest Power Pool (\"SPP\"), or the Midwest Independent Transmission\n\n15          System Operator, Inc. (\"MISO\"). The initial report regarding the CBAs - \"CBA of\n\n16          Entergy and Cleco Power Joining the SPP RTO\" - was released on September\n                                                                         '3S\"0 -1?. -1.\n17          30, 2010. I have attached a copy of that report as Exhibit dSD•1. The Executive\n                                                                          1\\\n18          Summary of that report provides a brief background regarding the study itself:\n\n19                  On June 24, 2009, the FERC and Entergy's retail regulators held a\n20                  technical conference in Charleston, South Carolina that was\n21                  attended by Entergy and many of the entities that purchase and/or\n22                  sell energy in the Entergy region. The FERC agreed to fund a Cost\n23                  Benefit Analysis (\"CBA\"} to study the costs and benefits of Entergy\n24                  and Cleco Power joining the SPP as full transmission-owning\n25                  members with their transmission facilities under SPP operational\n26                  control.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1                    The CBA was performed over a seven-month period, and included\n 2                    an open and collaborative discussion with stakeholders of the study\n 3                    framework, modeling approach, input assumptions, interim results,\n 4                    and qualitative issues throughout this period. 19 Based on the\n 5                    analysis performed, we conclude that Entergy and Cleco Power\n 6                    joining the SPP RTO will yield significant economic benefits to the\n 7                    collective SPP/Entergy region.\n\n 8\n\n 9   a.       WHAT IS THE BASIC METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH UNDERLYING THE\n\n10            CRA CBA ANALYSES?\n\n11   A        CRA collected data on all of the generating facilities and load serving entities\n\n12            located within the Entergy/Cieco Power, SPP, and MISO footprints. 2                   ° CRA then\n13            incorporated this data, along with other data representing the entire eastern\n\n14            interconnection, into the General Electric Multi-Area Production Simulation Model\n\n15            (\"GE MAPS\") model. GE MAPS is a detailed economic dispatch and production\n\n16            costing model that simulates the operation of the electric power system taking\n\n17            into account transmission topology.\n\n18                    Each scenario involved the preparation of two different GE MAPS cases\n\n19            over the 10 year period from 2013 to 2022:\n\n20                    1.       Entergy and Cleco Power continue to operate as they do today\n\n21                             (\"Status Quo Case\"}, and\n\n22                    2.       Entergy and Cleco Power join the SPP RTO (\"Join SPP Case\").\n\n\n\n     19\n          Mr. Pollock did not participate in any of these collaborative stakeholder activities. Pollock Depo at 36.\n     20\n          The \"Entergy region\" refers to the area within the Entergy transmission system footprint, and for\n          purposes of this study includes Louisiana Generating and Louisiana Energy and Power Authority. The\n          \"Cieco region\" refers to the area within the Cleco transmission system footprint as well as the Cleco\n          Power load served by the Entergy transmission system, and for purposes of this study includes the\n          City of Lafayette. The \"SPP region\" refers to the SPP transmission system footprint that is currently\n          operating within the SPP Energy Imbalance Service market.\n\n\n\n                                                          018\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1                   CRA typically presented the results of each scenario as the ten-year net\n\n 2            present value (\"NPV\") difference in the trade benefits between the two cases.\n\n 3            CRA presented results for the Entergy, Cleco, and SPP regions separately, and\n\n 4            the Entergy region trade benefits included the Entergy Operating Companies and\n\n 5            other entities, including, for example, Louisiana Generating, Louisiana Energy\n\n 6            and Power Authority, and Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation, Inc. 21\n\n 7            Trade Benefits are comprised of the production costs produced by the GE MAPS\n\n 8            model for the generating units in the SPP, Cleco and Entergy regions (fuel,\n\n 9           variable O&M and emission costs) plus purchased power costs net of energy\n\n10            sales revenue for each region and \"lost\" transmission revenue.                Transmission\n\n11            charges would not be assessed for transactions between SPP, Entergy and\n\n12            Cleco in the Join SPP Case, yielding reduced or \"lost\" transmission revenue that\n\n13            would have to be compensated for by increased charges to customers.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.       DID CRA PERFORM MORE THAN ONE CBA?\n\n16   A.      Yes. After the initial CBA to evaluate the potential benefits to joining SPP was\n\n17            begun, the alternative of joining the Midwest Independent System Operator, Inc.\n\n18            (\"MISO\") became feasible. That alternative was added to the list of CBAs that\n\n19            CRA was to prepare.          Moreover, and more relevant to this proceeding, the\n\n20            stakeholders requested that CRA perform a number of sensitivity and addendum\n\n21            studies to evaluate the sensitivity of CRAs results to different sets of input\n\n     21\n          CRA Sept 10 CBA at 2. Mr. Pollock incorrectly assumed that the CBA results for \"Entergy\" applied\n          just to the Operating Companies (See Pollock Depo at 35.) Mr. Pollock further admitted that his\n          analysis would be wrong if he mistakenly assumed that the values that CRA reported under \"Entergy\"\n          included more than just the Entergy Operating Companies (Pollock Depo at 36).\n\n\n\n                                                       019\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

The results of these sensitivity and\n\n2             addendum studies were memorialized by CRA in a December 8, 2010 report\n\n3             entitled \"Cost-Benefit Analysis of Entergy and Cleco Power Joining the SPP\n                                                                                          \"l~-R.~\n4             Addendum Study•.         In that report, which is attached as Exhibit J&B-5\", CRA\n\n5             explained that:\n\n6                    During the course of the SPP-Entergy CBA, potentially important\n 7                   parameters worthy of additional analysis were Identified by study\n 8                   stakeholders, including seams charges and the treatment of\n 9                   Entergy QFs. In response, CRA was engaged by Entergy to\n10                   perform an addendum study (\"SPP-Entergy CBA Addendum\"} to\n11                   analyze additional sensitivity cases using the models and input\n12                   assumptions developed under the SPP-Entergy CBA. This\n13                   addendum study was perfonned by CRA over a three-month\n14                   period, and included an open and collaborative discussion with\n15                   stakeholders of the sensitivity analyses to conduct, modeling\n16                   approach, input assumptions, and interim results throughout this\n17                   period.\n\n18                                                          ***\n19                   As trade benefrts are a key determinant in the overall benefits, the\n20                   impact on 2013 trade benefits resulting from alternative\n21                   assumptions in 2013 were the main focus of these addendum\n22                   studies.\n\n23                   The key sources of trade benefits between the Status Quo Case\n24                   and the Join SPP Case are the elimination of commitment and\n25                   dispatch seams charges, the elimination of IPP commitment\n26                   hurdles, and the treatment of QFs as firm resources. 22\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n     22\n          CRA Addendum Study at 3-4.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   l\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK USE      ONE        OF THESE   SENSITIVITIES     IN   THE\n\n 2             PREPARATION OF HIS TESTIMONY?\n\n 3   A.        Yes. He focused on the case in which CRA changed the Status Quo (\"SQ\") case\n\n 4             called \"SQ2: Entergy QFs Firm.\" 23 Mr. Pollock has testified that he thought that\n\n 5             sensitivity \"compared the benefits of firming up the QFs.\" 24 He further testified\n\n 6             that \"the whole purpose of doing the sensitivity study was to measure the\n\n 7             benefits of firming up the QFs.\" 25 It is unclear how or why Mr. Pollock arrived at\n\n 8             that conclusion; CRA itself reported that the purpose of the CRA CBA was to test\n\n 9             the robustness of the finding that there was a potential economic benefit\n\n10             associated with joining the SPP. 26 However, Mr. Pollock, who was not involved\n\n11             in the preparation of the initial CBA or in any of the subsequent addendum or\n\n12             sensitivity studies, misunderstood what that sensitivity was and how the results\n\n13             could be interpreted.\n\n14\n\n15   Q.        WHAT WAS THE SQ2:              ENTERGY QFs FIRM STUDY INTENDED TO\n\n16             ASSESS?\n\n17   Q.        CRA described the basis for this case by initially describing the treatment of QFs\n\n18             in the initial SPP-Entergy CBA:\n\n19                     QF Treatment. As discussed in the SPP-Entergy CBA, upon joining\n20                     an SPP Day 2 RTO, FERC may rule, as it has in other Day 2\n21                     markets, that the Entergy OF put options no longer apply. If so, the\n22                     QFs would have to provide prior notice of self scheduled output to\n\n     23\n          Pollock Depo at 37.\n     24\n          Pollock Depo at 40.\n     25\n          Pollock Depo at 41.\n     26\n          CRA Addendum Study at 3-4.\n\n\n\n                                                     021\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

That is, the QFs would effectively\n 2                     operate as IPPs, albeit with the added limitation of needing to serve\n 3                     their host load. To model this, in the Status Quo Case, the Entergy\n 4                     QFs were treated as \"non-firm\", meaning that the Entergy region is\n 5                     committed day-ahead without QF energy considered. In the Join\n 6                     SPP Case, the Entergy QFs were treated as \"firm\", meaning that\n 7                     the QFs were treated as available for commitment. 27\n\n 8             CRA then described the SQ2: Entergy QFs Firm in Status Quo Case: \"[t]his\n\n 9             sensitivity has QFs treated as firm in both the Status Quo Case and Join SPP\n\n10              Case.\" 28 Thus, SQ2 cannot possibly have measured the difference between\n\n11             treating QF puts as firm versus treating it as non-firm. The fact that the $50\n\n12             million trade benefit value for Entergy was based on a comparison of two\n\n13             scenarios that both treated QFs as firm can be confirmed by looking at Table 4\n\n14             of the December 8 Report, which indicates that both the Status Quo (SQ) 2 case\n\n15             and the Join SPP case assume that QFs are firm. 29 Mr. Pollock observed that \"if\n\n16             you're comparing the status quo case·and the SQ2, the analysis measures the\n\n17             benefits of firming up the QFs\" 30 However, the $50 million reported on Table 5 of\n\n18             the CRA CBA - the $50 million that Mr. Pollock actually used - was not a\n\n19             comparison of the initial status quo case and SQ2. It was instead a measure of\n\n20             the effect of eliminating only the seams charge between the SPP and Entergy\n\n21             regions, and as such cannot be said to determine the value of firming up the QF\n\n22             put.\n\n\n\n\n     27\n          CBA Addendum Study at 7.\n     28\n          CBA Addendum Study at 9 (emphasis added).\n     29\n          CBA Addendum Study at 8.\n     30\n          Pollock Depo at 44.\n\n\n\n                                                      022\n\f                                                                                                  ----   ----------\n\n\n\n\n     Entergy Texas, Inc.

It\n\n19          was intended to be a coordinated operating agreement that all of the Operating\n\n20          Companies, including Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Entergy Mississippi, Inc. -\n\n21          companies that have provided notice that they are terminating their participation\n\n22          in the System Agreement - to remain in a coordinated pooling agreement. The\n\n23          CODA was presented to each of the Operating Companies' retail regulators for\n\n24          comment and review, and none of those retail regulators saw enough promise in\n\n25          the CODA to proceed with further negotiations.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

IS THERE ONE SALIENT FEATURE OF THE CODA THAT IS RELEVANT TO\n\n 2             THIS PROCEEDING?\n\n 3   A.        Yes. One of the new and innovative features of the CODA was the introduction\n\n 4             of a \"Flex exchange\" that would equalize the cost of providing flexible capability\n\n 5             across all of the participating Operating Companies.            The nature of the flex\n\n 6             exchange, and an indication of the amount of flex capability that would be\n\n 7             exchanged among the Companies, was described in a presentation made at a\n\n 8             PUCT-sponsored technical conference. Mr. Pollock attached a few pages of that\n\n 9             presentation to the workpapers to his testimony.           I attach the entirety of that\n                                                            ~t> ..f-1{-\n10             presentation to my testimony as Exhibit JS&+.\n\n11\n\n12   Q.        DID MR. POLLOCK USE SOME INFORMATION FROM THAT PRESENTATION\n\n13             TO DERIVE A VALUE USED IN THIS PROCEEDING?\n\n14   A.        He did. Mr. Pollock relied on page 13 (Summary of Differences Between ETI's\n                                                                            3S~-rt-lf'\n15             costs under CODA versus the 5-1 scenario in 2014) of Exhibit dSB-4. In his\n\n16             recent deposition, Mr. Pollock testified:\n\n17                      2                All right. So if you start with that [page 13 slide], you\n18                      3    look at the column called flex cost allocation\n19                      4    differences, I had to eyeball what that is. That\n20                      5    represents the additional flexible capacity costs or\n21                      6    basically energy costs that Entergy would incur because\n22                      7    of its flexible energy requirements a portion of which\n23                      8    is attributable to the PURPA puts. 31\n24\n\n\n\n\n     31\n          Pollock Depo at 48 - 49.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     q\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                             Page23 of26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1   Q.     DOES MR. POLLOCK'S APPROACH PRODUCE A MEANINGFUL RESULT?\n\n 2   A.     No. The fundamental problem is that Mr. Pollock's starting point - the $40 million\n\n 3          that he eyeballs from the graph on page 13- is not a measure of the flexible\n\n 4          capability or energy costs that ETI would incur as a result of its flexible energy\n\n 5          requirements.     Rather, the graph presents a comparison of the costs that ETI\n\n 6          might have incurred while operating in 2014 under the System Agreement\n\n 7          without EAI and the costs that ETI might have expected to incur under the CODA\n\n 8          with all six Operating Companies participating. The bar that he uses as the basis\n\n 9          for his $40 million number is labeled \"Flex Cost Allocation Differences.\" I am\n\n10          perplexed as to how Mr. Pollock could look at those descriptions, especially in\n\n11          the overall context of this presentation, and reach the conclusion that the $40\n\n12          million was some sort of estimate of the cost of flexibility.\n\n13\n\n14   Q.     WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CONTEXT OF THE PRESENTATION IS\n\n15          IMPORTANT?\n\n16   A.     A review o!J. page 3 of the presentation (the entirety of which is attached at Exhibit\n            ~1)-'YI.•,.\n17          ~ may be helpful.

Slide 13 explains that under CODA,\n\n 5          ETI is allocated $40 million more in costs associated with flexibility than it is now\n\n 6          - in other words, under the current System Agreement regime, ETI is short on\n\n 7          flexibility but is not paying the other Operating Companies for that flexibility.\n\n 8\n\n g   a.     DOES THE APPLICATION OF MR. POLLOCK'S APPROACH TO OTHER\n\n10          OPERATING COMPANIES INDICATE THE FUNDAMENTAL FALLACY OF HIS\n\n11          APPROACH?\n\n\n\n\n                                                                026\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                  Page25of26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n1    A.      Yes. First, it is important to note that, as is the case in most forms of energy\n\n2            exchanges, the Flex Exchange sums to zero. That is, the amount of energy that\n\n3            is taken from the exchange exactly equals the amount of energy placed into the\n\n4            exchange. 32 The application of Mr. Pollock's approach would thus suggest that\n\n5            the value of flexible capability for the System is zero. Furthermore, page 14 of\n\n6            the same presentation upon which Mr. Pollock relies indicates that EAI has a\n\n7            negative $25 million Flex Cost Allocation Difference.              The application of Mr.\n\n 8           Pollock's method for valuing flexible capability to EAI would indicate that there is\n\n 9           a negative value, or a cost, associated with firming up the QFs.                That is a\n\n10           nonsensical result.       A valuation method that does not produce consistently\n\n11           meaningful results across companies cannot be relied upon.\n\n12\n\n13   Q.      ARE THERE OTHER FLAWS IN MR. POLLOCK'S CALCULATION?\n\n14   A.      Yes. The next error that I address is the \"Percent Affected• calculation that Mr.\n\n15           Pollock performs.\n\n16\n\n17   Q.      HOW DOES MR. POLLOCK DESCRIBE THE \"PERCENT AFFECTED•\n\n18           NUMBER?\n\n19   A.      Mr. Pollock claims that the Percent Affected number is the percentage of ETI's\n\n20           QF puts that would be eliminated as a result of the implementation of 150 MW of\n\n21           CGS Capacity. 33\n\n\n                                                                               5J.\n     32\n          Mr. Pollock acknowledged this fact in his deposition. Pollock Depo   at~\n     33\n          Pollock Depo at 53.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \\\\\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                      Page 26 of 26\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of J. Stephen Dingle\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n 1   Q.       IS MR. POLLOCK'S ASSERTION REASONABLE?\n\n 2   A        No. Mr. Pollock reaches his 31.6% Percent Affected value by assuming that the\n\n 3            150 MW of QF capacity that participates in the CGS program operates at a 100%\n\n 4            load factor. 34 He then multiplies 150 MW by 8, 760 hours per year by two years,\n\n 5           which yields 2,628,000 MWh, which Mr. Pollock then claims is the amount of\n\n 6           energy that would be provided by 150 MW of CGS generation. He then divides\n\n 7           that 2.6 million MWh of generation into 8.2 million MWh, which is the actual\n\n 8           amount of energy that QFs put to ETI over a two year period, to arrive at 31.6%.\n\n 9                   But, comparing one number (his assumed QF put) at an assumed 100%\n\n10           load factor with another number that reflects the actual load factor of the QFs that\n\n11           put to ETI, which is approximately 40%, is like comparing apples to oranges. A\n\n12           more reasonable calculation would be to compare the 150 MW of QF capacity\n\n13           that could potentially be firmed up via the CGS program to the 1 ,825 MW of\n\n14           eligible QF suppliers shown in Mr. Pollock's Exhibit JP-1.                That produces a\n\n15           \"Percent Affected,\" or percent of QF puts that would be potentially firmed up, at\n\n16           less than 12%.\n\n17\n\n18                                            V.

DOES THIS CONCLUDE YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL REBUTTAL TESTIMONY?\n\n20   A       Yes.\n\n\n\n\n     34\n          Which, as Mr. Pollock admitted in deposition, is an assumption inconsistent with the actual facts.\n          Pollock Depo at 52-53.\n\n\n\n                                                       028\n\f                                                                JSD-R-1\n                                                        Docket No. 389~\n                                                            Page 1 of~ \\1\n                                                                     1\n                                                               Page 35\n 1   River analysis looked at?\n 2      A     Well, it's -- the Charles River analysis looked\n 3   at the whole region, but then Entergy took that analysis\n 4   and did a second analysis that showed what the benefits\n s were for just the Entergy -- Entergy operating company.\n 6      Q     Right.   But you took that number from the\n 7   Charles River analysis.     Right?\n 8      A     I think that was the original source, but I'll\n 9 have to check it to make sure.\n10      Q     Well, let me ask you this.        If, in fact, that\n11   reference is from -- to Entergy is from the Charles\n12   River addendum, that's -- refers to the entire Entergy\n13   balancing authority.    Correct?     Not simply the Entergy\n14   operating companies?\n15      A     Well, I don't recall.       There were two studies.\n16   The original study was based on the regions, and then I\n17   think in the evaluation report that was filed by Entergy\n18   at the Commission, they separated the analysis between\n19   Entergy operating companies qnd the other regional\n20   companies.\n21       Q    Well, let me -- let me ask you this.        Is it\n22   correct that if more than just the Entergy operating\n23   companies are included in that number, that\n24   so million-dollar number, or -- I'm sorry -- the sales\n25   number in Row 1, your analysis would be incorrect, would\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                               \\L\n\f                                                                  JSD-R-1\n                                                          Docket No. 38951\n                                                                Page2of~l~\n                                                                  Page 36\n 1   it not?\n 2      A      Well, it -- it -- I mean, the       so million could\n 3   be higher or lower.      Just depends -- I mean, some of the\n 4   benefits went up when you only looked at Entergy only;\n S   but, yeah, if it         if, in fact, the    so million is\n 6   region-wide, then I should have used the            Entergy•s\n 7   operating company specific number, which is the number I\n 8   thought I used.\n 9      Q      All right.\n10      A        I'll have to check it and let you know.\n11      Q      Did you have any involvement with the\n12   development of the Charles River cost benefit analyses?\n13      A        I did not.\n14       Q       So you weren't -- you didn't participate in the\n1S   working group that put those together?\n16      A      No.\n\n17       Q       Did not attend the Entergy Regional State\n18   Committee meetings where they reviewed that modeling and\n19   set it up?\n20      A      No.\n\n21       Q       Have you reviewed the specific addendum study\n22   that that    so million-dollar number was based on?\n23       A       I've read through the study, yes.\n24       Q       All right.

I'll have to --\n25   I thought you would have that with you.\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                                r4\n\f                                                                 JSD-R-1\n                                                         Docket No. 389~y\n                                                             Page 4 of JiO lla\n\n                                                                 Page 40\n\n 1   $50 million is a comparison to the status quo.\n 2      Q     Well, take a look at Page 7 of the Exhibit 2.\n 3   Do you see where it says    11   SQ2: Entergy QFs Firm in\n 4   Status Quo Case\"?\n 5      A     Yes.\n 6       Q    And that says SQ2 -- in that sensitivity, it\n 7   says QFs are treated as firm in both the status quo case\n 8   and the join SPP case.     Do you see that?\n 9      A     Yes.\n10      Q     So SQ2 does not reflect the value of firming up\n11   the QF capacity, does it?\n12      A     Okay.    So the SQ is compared to status quo\n13   wait a second.    That's not right, then, because the\n14   status quo case says nonfirm.         So status quo in Table 4\n15   says nonfirm.    SQ2 shows firm.       So that is comparing the\n16   benefit of firming up the QFs.\n17                    I think there's something -- a problem\n18   with the way that's being described.         But if you go back\n19   to Table 4 and you start with the status quo case, that\n20   says \"QFs nonfirm.\"     SQ2 says \"QFs firm.\"      Therefore, it\n21   reflects the benefits of firming up the QFs.\n22       Q    But that's not what it says on Page 7.            It says\n23   that \"This sensitivity has QFs treated as firm in both\n24   the status quo case and join SPP case.\"\n25       A    Well, that's not what Table 4 says.\n\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                               JSD-R·1\n                                                       Docket No. 38951\n                                                           Page5of~(p\n\n                                                              Page 41\n 1       Q      So you -- you think that Charles River got it\n 2   wrong in their description on Page 7?\n 3       A      I think there could be a wrong description or a\n 4   misstatement on page -- on that page because the\n 5   chart -- I mean, the whole purpose of doing the\n                                                                          1\n 6   sensitivity study was to measure the benefits of firming              '\n\n\n\n 7   up the QFs.    In the status quo case, the QFs were not\n 8   firm.   That's what Table 4 says.    And we can read the\n 9   rest of the report.    That's the context in which that\n10   that sensitivity was done is what's the benefit of\n11   firming up QFs.\n12       Q      Well, what Table 4 shows is it starts the\n13   status quo case, then it does sensitivities.      Right?\n14       A      Right.\n15       Q      SQ2 shows that the sensitivity is -- make the\n16   QFs firm in the status quo case.     SQ, status quo.\n17   Correct?\n18       A      Status quo, Sensitivity 2, says --\n19       Q      Firm Entergy QFs.\n20       A      -- makes it firm.\n21       Q      Right?\n22       A      Right.   So --\n23                   (Simultaneous discussion)\n24       Q      At the bottom, join SPP case\n25                   MS.

Right?\n 4         A    No.     I'm comparing the status quo case where\n 5   QFs are nonfirm and SQ2 which the Entergy QFs are firm.\n 6         Q    But Charles River was comparing the status quo\n 7   case with the join SPP case, was it not?\n 8         A    Sure.\n 9         Q    And Status Quo Case 2, which it was comparing\n10   to the join SPP case, had the Entergy QFs firm.            Right?\n11         A    Status Quo 2 has the QFs as firm, yes.\n12         Q    And you compare that to the join SPP case, at\n13   the       they      it also has the QFs firm.     And Page 7\n14   explains it by saying only the seams charges are\n15   different between the two cases.        Isn't that not right?\n16         A    That's what it says.     I understand that.\n17         Q    All right.     But just so we can wrap this up, if\n18   you assume that the QFs are firm in both the status quo\n19   case and in the join SPP case being compared, then your\n20   analysis would be wrong.       Right?\n21         A     Well, the status quo case in Table 4 says QFs\n22   are nonfirm.       So if you're comparing the status quo case\n23   and the SQ2, the analysis measures the benefits of\n24   firming up the QFs.\n25         Q     Can you answer my question?\n                              Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                                  \\I\n\f                                                             JS.D- ~- ..1\n                                                         \\)oc.-~t~o. 3~Gj_\n                                                             \\)tt')e....

GRIFFITHS:     Objection, form.\n 9       A     If you're saying I compared the same\n10   circumstances in both cases they're firm, then I picked\n11   the wrong number.\n12       Q     (BY MR. WILLIAMS)       Okay.    You know,\n13   Mr. Pollock, your interpretation or explanation of this\n14   document, is that based just on looking at the face of\n15   the document here this afternoon or do you have some\n16   other information that leads you to that interpretation?\n17       A     I've read the reports.          I've read the reports\n18   when they were presented and read the reports when the\n19   company filed its technical report -- technical\n20   evaluation report with the Commission.\n21       Q     Okay.    So it's strictly based on reading the\n22   report?\n23       A     Yes.\n24       Q     Okay.    Going on to Line 3 of Deposition Exhibit\n25   1, there you calculate a dollar per megawatt hour per\n\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                             JSD-R-1\n                                                     Docket No.j8951\n                                                          Page7(   J$\\ /.Q\n                                                             Page 46\n\n 1   unit savings rate.     Why is it appropriate to use a\n 2   calculated capacity benefit of firming up capacity on a\n 3   dollar per megawatt hour, not a dollar per kW basis?\n 4      A      Since we're talking -- we're talking about\n 5   operating cost savings, and so the most -- and in this\n 6   case trade benefits, most of which are production cost,\n 7   most of which is that is fuel.\n 8       Q     Okay.   So these won't     these will be\n 9   produce fuel cost savings mostly.     Is that what you're\n10   saying?\n11      A      I said that the lower operating cost associated\n12   with reduced flexible capacity requirements; so, yes,\n13   there would be changes in operating costs.     It would be\n14   benefits that customers would see immediately in terms\n15   of lower fuel costs.\n16       Q     So these would not change the company's fixed\n17   capacity cost?\n18       A     Over time, they could because the company says\n19   it installs significant amount of flexible capacity in\n20   part to the -- for the -- reflect the PURPA put.        If you\n21   had no PURPA puts, there would be less reserve margin\n22   required; therefore, over time, there would be less\n23   capacity cost.\n24       Q     But you haven't calculated that?    You've\n25   calculated essentially a benefit that flows through fuel\n                            Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                               JSD-R-1\n                                                      Docket No.. )89~!.­\n                                                          Page/'..of ~ 1    A\n\n                                                                p.. \\w\n                                                              Page 48\n 1       A     Correct.   That's the work paper.\n 2                  All right.     So if you start with that, you\n 3   look at the column called flex cost allocation\n 4   differences, I had to eyeball what that is.      That\n 5   represents the additional flexible capacity costs or\n 6   basically energy costs that Entergy would incur because\n 7   of its flexible energy requirements, a portion of which\n 8   is attributable to the PURPA puts.\n 9                  I estimated about 20 percent of the -- and\n10   eyeballed the number there -- about 40 million-dollar\n11   impact, so it doesn't -- it only counts the additional\n12   flexible capacity or energy cost that ETI would incur\n13   under the CODA and not the -- kind of didn't count any\n14   of the flexible energy costs that ETI itself would\n15   incur.   This is additional cost that ETI would have to\n16   purchase from the other company.      I determined that\n17   about 20 percent of that 40 million would be\n18   attributable to the PURPA puts.      That's how I got the\n19   8 million.\n20       Q     How did you get 20 percent?\n21       A     I looked at the company's strategic resource\n22   plan and looked at what the resource plan was saying\n23   about variations in load in various different time\n24   periods, and it cited two things.      It cited the\n25   variations due to load swings and also the variations\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                                 2-D\n\f                                                              JSD-R-1\n                                                      Docket No. 38951\n                                                          Page/of '!I.\n                                                                ,o       \\Lt\n                                                             Page 49\n 1   due to the PURPA puts.    If I looked at all four of the\n 2   scenarios, I looked at the variation in the PURPA puts\n 3   to the sum of the variation of the PURPA puts and load\n 4   swing, and you get a number ranging anywhere from the QF\n 5   puts ranging anywhere from 15 to over half of the load\n 6   swings.   So I picked 20 percent.\n 7       Q     Okay.   Now, this analysis is based on\n 8   information related to what's called the CODA.       Right?\n 9       A     Yes.\n10       Q     What is the CODA?\n11       A     Commitment, operating and dispatch agreement,\n12   which was one of the alternatives that Entergy was\n13   considering as a successor to the current system\n14   agreement.\n15       Q     And looking back at the work paper regarding\n16   the summary of differences between ETI's costs under the\n17   CODA versus the 5-1 scenario --\n18       A     Yes.\n19       Q     -- are you saying the $40 million is the --\n20   well, explain to me again.      What are you saying the\n21   $40 million represents?\n22       A     If you look at the bar in the middle, it\n23   says -- under -- where it says \"Flex cost allocation\n24   differences\" and eyeball it, it looks like about -- the\n25   size of the bar is about 40 million.\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\n\n                               '2\\\n\f                                                         J\"<;.D-R,;j_\n                                                      DoL-¥-2-* No. 3&q«?:L\n                                                          Va~e.. l\\ of I{P\n                                                               Page 51\n\n1    operating company either has to self-provide or obtain\n2    from other operating companies so that it matches the\n3    amount of flexible capacity that each company requires.\n4                     In this case, ETI would have to spend\n5    about $40 million more than its existing flexible\n 6   capacity resources to meet its flexible capacity\n 7   requirements.\n 8       Q    So you agree that this flex exchange was\n 9   intended to compensate the operating companies that\n10   provide more than their proportioned share of flex --\n11   capability to the system?\n12       A    Yes, with the companies that need it more or\n13   has less than their necessary share of flexible\n14   resources.\n15       Q    Okay.     And so is it correct that a fundamental\n16   design principle for an exchange like this is that the\n17   dollars in megawatts hours in the exchange sum to zero?\n18                    MS.

So that means some\n21   operating companies would have negative values --\n22   right -- or payments associated with the flex exchange.\n23   Right?\n24       A    Right.

It's measuring a CGS customer's supply.\n20       Q      Well, do they -- will they -- do you expect a\n21   CGS customer or the CGS supplier to have a hundred\n22   percent load factor for over 24 months?\n23       A      Probably not exactly a hundred percent load\n24   factor, no.\n25       Q      Are you aware of any customer or supplier that\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                               JSD-R-1\n                                                       Docket No. 389~~\n                                                          Page ~of 1-5llt\n                                                              Page 53\n\n 1   has a hundred percent load factor now?\n 2       A      No.\n 3       Q      Line 10 has a -- the data is described as\n 4   percent affected.\n 5       A      Yes.\n 6       Q      And that's Line 8 divided by Line 9.     Right?\n 7       A      Yes.\n 8       Q      What is -- what is that representing, the\n 9   percent affected number?\n10       A      If we had 150 megawatts of QF puts, that would\n11   roughly be about 31.6 percent of all the QF puts that\n12   Entergy Texas bought power from over that 24-month\n13   period.\n14       Q      So you're saying that firming up 150 megawatts\n15   of QF puts would alleviate the flexible capability needs\n16   of a third of ETI's entire annual energy needs?\n17       A      No.    It would eliminate about a third --\n18   31.6 percent of the PURPA put.\n19       Q      So why do you -- so why do you multiply the\n20   percent affected by the total sales?\n21       A      So the average effect is 46 cents a megawatt\n22   hour.     It affects roughly 31.6 percent of the total\n23   sales.    So that's why the value is basically the 46\n24   cents times 31.6 percent times ETI's sales.       That gets\n25   you to 2.3 million.\n\n                             Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                        -rsD-lt-j_\n                                                      Dod'- eJ ~o . 38C.,51...\n                                                           \\)tvj{_   l4   o.C. l i.Q\n                                                                Page 72\n\n1       A      The answer is whatever the power plant is still\n2    providing service, it's providing service to somebody.\n3    It's needed by somebody on the system.\n4        Q     So the CGS contract will not cause me to be\n5    able to reduce those capacity costs associated with that\n 6   generating plant.     Right?\n\n 7       A     Not exactly on the day of the CGS contract; but\n 8   over time, it might.\n\n 9       Q     Well, my hypothetical was year ten of a 40-year\n\n10   power plant life.     There's no CGS contract going to\n11   cause me to shed those capacity costs.       Right?\n12       A      I understand.\n13       Q     Was the answer\n14       A     The company is in a deficit, and so the company\n15   needs additional capacity.       It's that additional\n16   capacity that would be avoided.\n17       Q      Okay.   So we're not talking about historical\n18   we'r~   not talking about avoiding historical embedded\n19   capacity costs with CGS capacity.        We're talking about\n20   the ability to avoid potentially some capacity costs\n21   that's incremental that results --\n\n22       A      Well, not entirely.     No.   Your example was for\n23   power plants.      And, you know, for power plants, you have\n24   a need, and it would be an avoided -- it would be\n25   avoiding another power plant coming in, which would\n\n                             Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                             JSD-R-1\n                                                     Docket No. 389~\n                                                          Page~.

And that's an incremental\n 3       A    There could be -- there could be a purchased\n 4   power agreement that you would otherwise not extend\n 5   because you got this -- you've already met the supply\n 6   deficit with CGS supply.\n 7       Q    Okay.    Well, I bite.   Let's go onto the\n 8   purchased power example.\n 9                    If I have a purchased power contract\n10   that's ten years -- has ten years to run on it when I\n11   enter into a CGS contract, I'm not going to avoid any of\n12   the capacity costs under that purchased power contract\n13   because I entered into a CGS contract.     Right?\n14       A    Not for that specific contract, no; but you\n15   might not enter into a new contract, or you might\n16   enter· -- exit a contract that existed at the time the\n17   rates were set because you didn't need the capacity.\n18   You didn't -- you decided not to extend the term.        I\n19   mean, that's why you enter into some short-term\n20   contracts.\n21       Q    Yeah.    And assuming you had the right to get\n22   out of that contract?\n23      A     Oh, contracts have a specific term.        Sometimes\n24   there's one year.     Sometimes it's three years.\n25   Sometimes it's ten years.     At the end of one year, three\n                           Kennedy Reporting\n\f                                                                    JSD·R-1\n                                                           Docket No. :}8951\n                                                               Page)'! of)'!,\n                                                                    \\\\1 \\\\1\n                                                                   Page 74\n\n 1    years, ten years, you can      deci~e   to renew it or not.\n 2    It's not a question of breaking a contract.

I sponsor the exhibits listed in the Table of Contents to my\n\n     3            testimony.\n\n     4\n\n     5     Q.     WILL    ANY OTHER WITNESSES ADDRESS CGS ISSUES IN\n\n     6            SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECT TESTIMONY?\n\n     7     A.     Company witness J. Steven Dingle with ESI's System Planning and\n\n     8            Operations group (SPO) will provide testimony supporting certain of the\n\n     9           issues I address, as well as additional matters that remain unresolved in\n\n 10              this docket. Specifically, Mr. Dingle also addresses the 24/7 firm nature of\n\n 11              the CGS product and how that affects the Unserved Energy rate, which I\n\n12               also address in part. In addition, Mr. Dingle addresses issues regarding\n\n13               the Entergy System Agreement and the Entergy Operating Committee's\n\n14               role and authority under that agreement; how the CGS program could be\n\n15               affected by ETI's integration into the Midwest Transmission System\n\n16               Operator; termination payments should the CGS Supplier or CGS\n\n17               Customer default in their obligations to provide CGS supply for the entire\n\n18               contracted period; the process for initiating CGS service; and TIEC's\n\n19               proposed \"force majeure\" provision for the CGS Purchase Agreement.\n\n20\n\n21        Q.    WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE PURPOSE OF THE\n\n22              CGS PROGRAM?\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                        Page 5 of 23\n          Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1   A.     The tentative terms and conditions that address how the CGS program\n\n     2           would work are included in Section I of the CGS Stipulated Matters and\n\n     3           Stipulated Facts filed by the parties to this proceeding on January 20,\n\n     4           2012. In this answer, I will explain the primary (but not all) provisions of\n\n     5           the program as laid out in those stipulations.\n\n     6                  The CGS program, in accordance with PURA § 39.452 and as\n\n     7           proposed to be structured by the parties, is intended to provide a specific\n\n     8           subset of customers (CGS Customers) within ETI's Large Industrial Power\n\n     9          Service (LIPS) Rate Schedule class with the ability, consistent with the\n\n 10             requirements of federal law and FERC tariffs including the Entergy System\n\n 11             Agreement, to obtain generation service from an alternative supplier. In\n\n12              order to accomplish this objective, to address the Commission's concerns\n\n13              regarding cost shifting under the program, and to address other significant\n\n14              limitations imposed by the legislation (including the requirement that the\n\n15              CGS program not create a conflict with Federal law), the parties to this\n\n16              proceeding have engaged in extensive negotiations and arrived at a\n\n17              tentative solution to at least some aspects of the CGS program design.\n\n18                     Under this collaborative proposal, customers eligible for CGS\n\n19              service will contract with a CGS Supplier, which must be a Qualified\n\n20              Facility (\"QF\") as defined by Rate Schedule LQF that is or will be\n\n21             interconnected to       ETI,   for a     negotiated level of CGS       capacity\n22             (Supplier-Customer Contract).         ETI will not be a party to this contract;\n23             however,      the    Supplier/QF       (\"CGS   Supplier\"),   based    on    the\n\n                                                9^\n\f             Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                  Page 6 of 23\n             Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n             Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1              Supplier-Customer Contract, will then enter into a CGS Purchase\n\n 2                  Agreement with the Company for the same level of capacity as in the\n\n 3                  Supplier-Customer Contract.             As further discussed in Mr. Dingle's\n\n 4                  Supplemental Direct Testimony, the capacity supplied by the CGS\n\n 5                  Purchase Agreement will take the form of a 24/7 unit contingent product.\n\n 6                  Mr. Dingle also explains, upon fulfillment of other conditions addressed in\n\n 7                  his testimony in a manner satisfactory to the Entergy Operating\n\n 8                  Committee, that Committee has agreed to recognize that the CGS\n\n 9                  Purchase Agreement can provide firm capacity (or, in the terms of the\n\n10                  Entergy System Agreement, \" capability\") to the Entergy System.3\n\n11                          ETI will not make a capacity payment directly to the CGS Supplier.\n\n12                  Instead, ETI will provide a credit to the CGS Customer equal to ETI's\n\n13                  non-fuel embedded generation cost (measured in $/kW/month) for that\n\n14                 customer times the CGS Supplied Capacity (kW). Any compensation for\n\n15                 the CGS capacity to the CGS Supplier is paid by the CGS Customer\n\n16                 pursuant to the terms of a separate Supplier-Customer Contract.\n\n17\n\n18       Q.        IS THE INTENT OF THE CGS PROGRAM TO CREATE A CAPACITY\n\n19                 MARKET FOR ETI?\n\n\n\n\n         3     By providing this testimony, ETI does not in any manner waive its rights to fully contest and\n               independently assert its rights regarding any and all matters that remain in dispute among the\n               parties. ETI presents this testimony solely for the purpose of facilitating the Commission's\n               resolution of the issues listed above.\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 7 of 23\n          Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1    A.     No.      As explained by Mr. Dingle, the CGS program is not intended, or\n\n     2           needed, as a means to fulfill ETI's resource needs and the Company\n\n     3           would oppose any effort to place a value on CGS capacity based on an\n\n     4           alleged resource need for the program.              To the contrary, the CGS\n     5           program, as I noted above, is designed as a means whereby a limited\n\n     6           class of eligible customers could gain access to an alternative source of\n\n     7           generation apart from that offered by ETI.\n\n     8                    The Entergy system has planned for and acquired, and will\n\n     9          continue to plan for and acquire, short-term, limited-term and long-term\n\n 10             resources needed by ETI to reliably serve its Texas customers. However,\n\n11              if implemented properly and consistent with applicable legal requirements,\n\n12              the CGS program could provide a modest amount of additional capacity\n\n13              for the Entergy System.           As discussed below and in Mr. Dingle's\n14              testimony, however, this resource would come with limitations.\n\n15\n\n16                 III.     NON-FUEL EMBEDDED GENERATION COST CREDIT\n17       Q.     WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF THE LIPS NON-FUEL EMBEDDED\n\n18              GENERATION          COSTS THAT           WILL   BE     CREDITED TO CGS\n19              CUSTOMERS AS PART OF THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n20       A.     The LIPS non-fuel embedded generation costs derived from the rates\n\n21              recently set by the Commission in ETI's most recent base rate Docket\n\n22             No. 39896 is $6.33 per kW per month. The order approving new rates in\n\n23             Docket No. 39896 became final in mid-December 2012 and the new rates\n\n\n                                                  ^^\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                       Page 8 of 23\n         Supplemental Direct Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n         Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1          relate back to service rendered on and after June 30, 2012. As a result,\n\n     2          the LIPS non-fuel embedded generation costs figure that has been\n\n     3          addressed in prior filings in this docket should be changed from the $6.84\n\n     4          per kW per month that resulted from the prior rates approved in ETI\n\n     5          Docket No. 37744 to the $6.33 per kW per month derived from the more\n\n     6          recent Docket No. 39896. A schedule showing how the $6.33 per kW per\n\n     7          month non-fuel embedded cost figure is derived is attached as my Exhibit\n\n     8          DRR-SD-1. The $6.84 per kW value resulting from Docket No. 37744,\n\n 9              and agreed to by all parties to this docket, was developed by taking the\n\n10              LIPS class non-fuel embedded production cost from the Company's\n\n11              rebuttal cost of service and scaling this value down based on the\n\n12              difference between the LIPS non-fuel total revenue requirement resulting\n\n13             from the settlement in Docket No. 37744 and the LIPS non-fuel total\n\n14             revenue requirement from the Company's rebuttal cost of service. The\n\n15             resulting scaled value was then divided by the LIPS billing demand to\n\n16             develop the LIPS non-fuel embedded production cost on a $/kW basis.\n\n17             This scaling was necessary because the settlement from Docket No.\n\n18             37744 did not identify the functional revenue requirement by rate class. A\n\n19             similar situation exists now as a result of ETI's most recent base rate case\n\n20             (Docket No. 39896) because the Staff's cost of service number running\n\n21             model from Docket No. 38986 also does not identify the functional\n\n22             revenue requirement by rate class.           As shown on my attached Exhibit\n23             DRR-SD-1, and its supporting work papers, a similar process was used to\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n         Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1          develop the non-fuel embedded production cost for the LIPS class for\n\n     2          Docket No. 38986. This change to $6.33 per kW per month should be\n\n     3          made in Section VI.B. of Schedule CGS, which is Exhibit DRR-SD-2 to my\n\n     4          testimony.     As currently written, that section acknowledges that the\n\n     5          $6.84 figure should be updated to the current applicable non-fuel\n\n     6          embedded generation cost figure.\n\n     7\n\n     8   Q.     BY AGREEING THAT $6.33 PER KW PER MONTH SHOULD BE\n\n     9          CREDITED TO CGS CUSTOMERS, IS ETI MAKING ANY CONCESSION\n\n10              REGARDING          THE      DETERMINATION      OF      THE    COMPANY'S\n11             \"UNRECOVERED COSTS\" RESULTING FROM THE CGS PROGRAM?\n\n12       A.    No.     The Interim Order issued by the Commission in this Docket\n\n13             No. 38951 on June 12, 2012 concluded, on an interim basis, that the\n\n14             non-fuel embedded generation costs avoided by the CGS customer are\n\n15             not included within the meaning of the phrase \" unrecovered costs\" to the\n\n16             Company as that phrase is used in PURA § 39.452(b). I understand that\n\n17             that is the Commission's interim ruling, and my testimony here is limited to\n\n18             identifying the level of the LIPS credit that would be provided to the CGS\n\n19             Customers under the CGS rider. By providing this testimony, ETI is not\n\n20             waiving its right to contest the Commission's ruling as to what is and what\n\n21             is not an \" unrecovered cost\" under PURA § 39.452(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                                l,Q,\n\f           Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE NATURE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE\n\n     3            UNSERVED ENERGY RATE INCLUDED IN THE CGS PROGRAM.\n\n     4     A.     The unserved energy rate is covered in Section VII of the CGS rider, and\n\n     5            is included in both the Company's (Exhibit No. DRR-SD-2) and TIEC's\n\n     6            proposed riders. ETI charges the CGS Customer under this rate when the\n\n     7            CGS Supplier fails to provide the contracted CGS capacity that is intended\n\n     8            to be made available on a 24/7 basis to serve the CGS Customers.\n\n     9            Charging the unserved energy rate allows ETI to recover the costs of\n\n 10              continuing to serve the CGS Customer when the CGS Supplier fails to\n\n 11              deliver. By implementing an Unserved Energy rate, other customers are\n\n12               protected because they are not then burdened with bearing the cost of the\n\n13               energy that ETI must provide to make up for the lack of CGS supply. This\n\n14               is also why the revenues from the Unserved Energy are credited to ETI's\n\n15               fuel balance-to ensure that other customers are not being harmed when\n\n16               a CGS Supplier fails to deliver its contracted supply.\n\n17\n\n18        Q.     PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SECOND ISSUE THAT YOU ADDRESS: TIEC'S\n\n19               PROPOSAL TO ALLOW A CGS CUSTOMER TO REDUCE ITS LOAD\n\n20               TO MATCH A DECREASE IN DELIVERIES BY THE CGS SUPPLIER,\n\n21              AND THEREBY AVOID UNSERVED ENERGY CHARGES.\n\n22        A.    TIEC's proposed CGS rider, at the end of the first sentence in Section VII,\n23              \"Unserved Energy,\" includes the words:            \"less any corresponding\n\n                                                  to\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1          reduction in the CGS Customer's electricity usage.\" I understand this\n\n     2           phrase to mean that a CGS Customer would be allowed to reduce its load\n\n     3           to match a corresponding reduction in its CGS Supplier's deliveries to ETI,\n\n     4           and thereby potentially avoid unserved energy charges.          ETI does noi\n     5           agree with TIEC's proposal to allow the CGS Customer to avoid unserved\n\n     6           energy payments in this manner.             Company witness Dingle addresses\n     7           certain aspects of this issue in support of ETI's position.\n\n     8                  In addition to Mr. Dingle's points, this proposal by TIEC is\n\n     9          unworkable for a number of reasons related to metering and tracking. If\n 10             TIEC's proposal were adopted:\n\n 11                     (1) ETI has no way to know that a reduction in a Customer's load is\n 12             for economic reasons, rather than because of a reduction in the\n\n13              Customer's CGS Supplier's supply;\n\n14                     (2) Entergy's System Operations Center real-time system does not\n15              meter customers' consumption (CGS or otherwise). Because there is no\n16              real-time data as to both the CGS Customers and CGS Suppliers, there is\n17              not a reliable method for a CGS Supplier to notify its CGS Customer(s)\n18             that it is reducing its supply;\n\n19                     (3) In the situation of one CGS Supplier serving multiple CGS\n20             Customers, when the CGS Supplier reduces its supply, there is no method\n21             for prioritizing the reduction to the multiple Customers, and therefore no\n22             method for determining which CGS Customer should avoid unserved\n23             energy charges or the level of required reduction; and\n\n\n                                                 i^\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n          Docket No. 38951\n\n\n      1                  (4) In the reverse situation-one CGS Customer with multiple CGS\n\n     2           Suppliers-all hierarchy rules as to CGS and non-CGS supplies from the\n\n     3           Supplier are set by the Supplier, and ETI has no way of knowing how to\n\n     4           allocate the reduction in the Customer's load to multiple CGS Suppliers.\n\n     5           As a consequence of these various uncertainties, there is no way to\n\n     6           reliably match a CGS supply reduction to a CGS customer load reduction.\n\n     7                  In addition to the metering and tracking-related implications that I\n\n     8          just described, Mr. Dingle also notes that the CGS program is intended to\n\n     9          result in a 24/7 firm product, and the 80% capacity factor built in to the\n\n 10             CGS program is intended to cover potential unavoidable reductions in\n\n 11             CGS Supplier deliveries to ETI. If the CGS Customer is also allowed to\n\n12              reduce its load to offset any reduction in CGS supply, the \"firmness\" of the\n\n13              CGS program, and the very basis for treating the CGS Supplier's\n\n14              deliveries as firm capacity, is compromised. If the CGS program in fact\n\n15              results in a non-firm capacity product from a CGS Supplier, then the\n\n16              Entergy Operating Committee may well determine that it cannot treat that\n\n17              CGS Supplier's CGS capacity as firm and will thereby need to plan to\n\n18              serve that Supplier's CGS Customer(s) with Entergy System capacity,\n\n19              rather than CGS capacity, thus nullifying the core intent of the program as\n\n20             to that Supplier and its CGS Customers.\n\n21                     As noted, ETI must stand ready to serve the CGS Customer\n\n22             regardless of what the CGS Supplier delivers to ETI. The solution to\n\n23             TIEC's issue is for the CGS Customer and its CGS Supplier to agree to\n\n\n                                                   I„-5-\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

TIEC'S PROPOSED RIDER CGSC DOES NOT ALLOW ETI TO\n     7        RECOVER ITS CGS IMPLEMENATION AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS\n     8   Q.     PLEASE ADDRESS ETI'S CONCERNS WITH TIEC'S PROPOSED\n\n 9              RIDER SCHEDULE CGSC.\n\n10       A.     Rider CGSC establishes the formula and method by which ETI would\n\n11              recover its costs of implementing and administering the CGS program.\n\n12             TIEC's version and ETI's version of Rider CGSC are very different. ETI's\n\n13             version is attached as my Exhibit DRR-SD-3. TIEC's version is attached\n\n14             to its November 27, 2012 Motion filed in this docket.\n\n15                     TIEC's Rider CGSC fails to carry out the requirement of PURA\n\n16             § 39.452(b) that ETI incur no \"unrecovered costs\" in connection with the\n\n17             CGS program. TIEC's proposal erroneously:\n\n18                 •   eliminates virtually all recovery of implementation costs prior to the\n19                     date the Commission approves the program (save for a small\n20                     amount included in ETI's most recently established base rates)\n21                     (TIEC CGSC Rider Sections II, IV, and V);\n22                 •   makes no provision for ETI recovery of implementation costs to the\n23                     extent there are no CGS subscribers;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   /I/\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

The\n     7                      parties have previously agreed that revenues only from the variable\n     8                      O&M portion of the Unserved Energy rate are to be used to reduce\n     9                      unrecovered costs. The parties have further previously agreed that\n 10                         other revenues from the Unserved Energy rate are to be used to\n 11                         reduce reconcilable fuel costs;\n 12                    •    applies revenues from the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee to offset\n 13                         and reduce the recovery of CGS program implementation and\n 14                         administrative costs. (TIEC Rider CGSC, Attachment A).\n 15\n16       Q.     WHAT IS ETI'S POSITION WITH REGARD TO CGSC COSTS\n17              INCURRED PRIOR TO THE DATE THE COMMISSION APPROVES THE\n18              CGS PROGRAM?\n19       A.     For purposes of the current CGS proposal, ETI has been incurring costs to\n20              implement this CGS program since 2009 when it proposed the basis for\n21              the current CGS proposal in its base rate case filing in Docket No. 37744.\n22             The current Docket No. 38951 was severed from Docket No. 37744 and\n23             has proceeded since then to result in the CGS riders now at issue before\n24             the Commission.         ETI will continue to incur those implementation costs\n25             until       the   program   commences,         and then will incur costs to\n26             administer/operate the program once the Commission issues its order\n\n27             directing ETI to proceed with the program.            ETI should recover these\n\n\n\n                                                      (?\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

However,\n\n 7              to show the Rider CGSC calculation for illustrative purposes, ETI is\n\n 8              deducting $310,746 from the $940,500.          This illustration is shown on\n\n 9              Attachment A to Rider CGSC (Exhibit DRR-SD-3). The $310,746 is the\n\n10              amount of affiliate-related costs charged to the CGS Project Code during\n\n11              the Docket No. 39896 test year, and now included in ETI's current base\n\n12              rates as a result of the Commission's order in that case. Thus, ETI is not\n\n13             double recovering these CGSC-related costs through both current base\n\n14             rates    and     ETI's   proposed    Rider   CGSC.    As also shown on\n15             Exhibit DRR-SD-3, ETI has also deducted an assumed (for illustrative\n\n16             purposes) $20,000 attributable to the \"Rider CGSC Unserved Energy\n\n17             Variable O&M Charge,\" for a total Rider CGSC Recovery Amount of\n\n18             $619,254.      To derive the Rider CGSC rate for the following year, the\n\n19             CGSC Recovery Amount would be divided by the CGS or LIPS class kW\n\n20             for the prior year. This initial Rider CGSC rate would be proposed some\n\n21             months after the Commission approves a CGS Program, but ETI cannot\n\n22             identify precisely when that filing would be made until it has a Commission\n\n23             order in hand.\n\n\n                                                    17\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

Through this definition,\n 6               TIEC is proposing that ETI not recover any of its implementation costs\n\n 7               incurred prior to the date the Commission approves the CGS Program.\n\n 8               ETI disagrees with that position because it would result in ETI not\n\n 9              recovering those unrecovered costs, contrary to PURA § 39.452.\n\n10\n\n11       Q.     SHOULD RIDER CGSC ACCOUNT FOR A POTENTIAL SITUATION IN\n12              WHICH THERE ARE NO CGS SUBSCRIBERS?\n\n13       A.     Yes.   TIEC's proposed Rider CGSC does not account for this potential\n14              situation. In that situation, ETI will, nevertheless, have incurred costs to\n\n15              implement the program even if no Customers subscribe. These would be\n\n16              \"unrecovered\" implementation and administrative costs, which ETI is\n\n17              entitled to recover in accordance with PURA § 39.452, as is provided for in\n\n18              ETI's proposed Rider CGSC. ETI's proposal is that, if there are no CGS\n\n19             subscribers, these costs would be recovered from all customers taking\n20             service under Rate Schedules LIPS and LIPS Time-of-Day.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      i^\n\f               Entergy Texas, Inc.

Yes.    As noted above, there is a time value of money associated with\n\n     5                  ETI's expenditures between the time those expenditures are made and\n\n     6                  when they are actually recovered through Rider CGSC. ETI's proposed\n\n     7                  Rider CGSC, therefore, includes a cumulative interest line item to account\n\n     8                  for this value.4\n\n     9\n\n 10           Q.

No. The parties have agreed that the structure of the rate for Unserved\n\n14                     Energy will include an agreed energy charge and an agreed Operation\n\n15                     and Maintenance (O&M) adder.

The document\n\n 2                     provides that revenues from the variable O&M portion of the Unserved\n\n 3                     Energy rate will be used to offset unrecovered costs.5 But that stipulation\n\n 4                     also provides that the revenues from the portion of the rate that is based\n\n 5                     on system avoided energy charges will go towards offsetting ETI's eligible\n\n 6                     fuel costs.6 Thus, to maintain consistency with the parties' agreement, not\n\n 7                     all revenues from the Unserved Energy rate are used to offset the CGSC\n\n 8                     costs-only revenues the variable O&M charges are used for that\n\n 9                     purpose, and is necessary to help prevent other non-participating\n\n10                    customers from subsidizing the CGS Program.\n\n11\n\n12                                   VI.    FIXED COST CONTRIBUTION FEE\n13           Q.       WHAT IS THE \"FIXED COST CONTRIBUTION FEE\"?\n\n14       A.           This fee is a fixed dollar per kW charge paid on a monthly basis to ETI by\n\n15                    a CGS customer as part of the compensation ETI receives to provide CGS\n\n16                    service. This fee is referenced in Section VI of the CGS rider proposed by\n\n17                    both TIEC and ETI.\n\n\n\n\n                  This may be a typographical error. It is possible that TIEC intended to reference variable\n                  O&M revenue only from the unserved energy rate as being used to reduce the unrecovered\n                  implementation and administrative costs.

WHY SHOULD THE $1.10 per kW FIXED COST CONTRIBUTION FEE\n\n 7                 NOT BE USED TO REDUCE RIDER CGSC COSTS?\n\n 8   A.           As recognized by TIEC, the Office of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC), and\n\n 9                the Cities in this docket, the $1.10 per kW Fixed Cost Contribution Fee is\n\n10                 intended to compensate ETI for standing ready to serve the CGS\n\n11                Customer.' This $1.10 fee was intended to offset unrecovered production\n\n12                costs, not unrecovered implementation and administration costs.                      This\n13                point is addressed in the \"Agreed List of Settled Issues\" filed in this docket\n\n     '         The citations to TIEC's OPUC's, and the Cities' testimony on this point are: Direct Testimony\n               of TIEC witness Jeffry Pollock at page 16, lines 3-11: \"The costs of backup power will be\n               paid for by CGS Customers through the Unserved Energy Rate and a Fixed Cost\n               Contribution Fee referenced in the Stipulation. Unserved Energy will be priced at 105% of\n               avoided energy cost plus an O&M Adder. This is similar to how ETI currently prices backup\n               power in Schedule SMS. In addition, the CGS Customer will be required to pay a Fixed Cost\n               Contribution Fee of $1.10 per kW-Month of CGS Contract Capacity. The Unserved Energy\n               pricing mechanism ensures that CGS Customers pay all of the incremental variable costs\n              associated with back-up power plus a contribution to generation fixed costs.\" (Feb. 10, 2012)\n              Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of TIEC witness Jeffry Pollock at page 12, lines 7-9: \"ETI\n              will incur production costs (capacity, O&M, fuel) only to provide backup power, which is\n              covered through the Unserved Energy rate and the Fixed.\" (Feb. 24, 2012). Supplemental\n              Direct Testimony of OPUC witness Clarence Johnson at page 11, lines 16-18: \"ETI must\n              maintain generating capacity to serve CGS load when the associated cogeneration is not\n              providing output. The CGS customers pay a$1:10 per month fixed charge in recognition of\n              that fact.\" (Feb. 10, 2012). Supplemental Direct Testimony of Cities witness Karl Nalepa at\n              page 10, lines 14-17: \"Over time, the only production costs that would be incurred by ETI for\n              providing firm production service to CGS customers should be recovered through the CGS\n              fixed cost contribution and revenues generated from the variable O&M unserved energy rate.\n              If not, the fixed cost contribution and unserved energy rate should be adjusted so that the\n              CGS customer is responsible for any production costs that it causes to be incurred.\" (Feb. 10,\n              2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                     ^^\n\f             Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n             Docket No. 38951\n\n\n     1              on November 1, 2011, which, at page 3, Section G, states: \"Certain\n\n 2                  revenues from the Unserved Energy Rate, and all revenues from the\n\n 3                  Fixed Cost Contribution, will be applied as an offset to any production\n\n 4                  costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the CGS tariff.\"\n\n 5                  (Emphasis added.)       ETI's position on this point is further bolstered by\n\n-6                  Cities acknowledgment that the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee was intended\n\n 7                  to offset embedded production costs: \"Even though ETI alleges that the\n\n 8                  unrecovered costs would be the full amount of LIPS production cost\n\n 9                  revenues of $6.84/kW/month, ETI would reduce (or offset) that amount by\n\n10                 the fixed cost contribution fee and the variable O&M unserved energy\n\n11                 revenues.\"8 Thus, the $1.10 charge was intended to offset \"production\"\n\n12                 costs, not the implementation and administration costs covered by Rider\n\n13                 CGSC. As indicated by TIEC, OPUC, and the Cities, the $1.10 charge is\n\n14                 necessary to compensate ETI for standing ready to serve the CGS\n\n15                 Customers and, therefore, should be retained by ETI rather than being\n\n16                 credited back to the customers who paid that monthly charge. The $1.10\n\n17                 charge cannot be used to recover both implementation costs and also\n\n18                 compensate ETI for standing ready to serve CGS customers.\n\n\n\n\n         8     Karl Nalepa Supplemental Direct Testimony at page 11, lines 19-22 (Feb. 10, 2012)\n               ( Emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                     ^j\n\f          Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE BRIEFLY DESCRIBE EACH OF THESE RIDERS.\n\n     8    A.    Rider CGS is the schedule that sets out the CGS program. It is attached\n\n     9          as my Exhibit DRR-SD-2. Rider CGS addresses: the availability of CGS\n 10             service; who is eligible for this service; how CGS service is initiated;\n\n 11             tracking certifications; termination events and rights; billing; unserved\n 12             energy; metering; and reporting requirements.    Rider CGS also includes\n 13             an \"Appendix A,\" which sets out the general terms and conditions that\n14              would apply to an ETI-Supplier Contract. ETI had intended that a form of\n15              the ETI-Supplier Contract would have been developed and filed with these\n16              Riders, but ETI and TIEC were unable to agree to such a form contract.\n17                       I have generally described Rider CGSC above.        This Rider,\n18             attached as Exhibit DRR-SD-3, sets out the recovery of ETI's CGS\n19             implementation and administration costs.         This Rider includes an\n20             \"Attachment A\" that sets out the proposed CGSC rate for illustrative\n21             purposes.       The Company's intention would be to file a revised Rider\n22             CGSC when the costs of developing and administering the ultimate CGS\n23             program are known.\n\n\n\n                                                -^ Y\n\f         Entergy Texas, Inc.

PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME, BUSINESS ADDRESS, EMPLOYER AND\n\n3            JOB TITLE.\n\n4    A.      My name is Dennis R. Roach.

RESPONSE TO TIEC\n\n13    Q.      ON PAGE 9 OF HIS SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECT TESTIMONY,\n\n14            TIEC WITNESS JEFFRY POLLOCK STATES THAT \"TIEC'S PROPOSED\n\n15            [CGS] TARIFF COMPORTS WITH THE PARAMETERS OF THE CGS\n\n16            PROGRAM AS DISCUSSED IN THE PRIOR STIPULATIONS AND IN\n\n17            THE INTERIM ORDER, AND IT PROVIDES A WORKABLE PROCESS\n\n18            FOR INITIATING CGS SERVICE.\" HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n19    A.      While I agree that ETI and TIEC (along with the Staff and other parties)\n\n20             have made significant progress in resolving many contentious and\n\n21             complex issues, TIEC's version of Rider CGS does not comply with the\n\n\n      '    ESI is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that provides technical and administrative services\n           to all the Entergy Operating Companies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           final sentence in PURA § 39.452(b) because it would be contrary to \"an\n\n2           applicable decision, rule or policy statement of a federal regulatory\n\n3           authority having jurisdiction\" (that is, the Federal Energy Regulatory\n\n4           Commission) as discussed by Company witness Dingle. In addition,\n\n5           TIEC's version of Rider CGS should be rejected for the reasons discussed\n\n6            in Mr. Dingle's Supplemental Direct and Second Supplemental Rebuttal\n\n7            Testimony, as well as my Supplemental Direct and this Supplemental\n\n 8           Rebuttal Testimony.\n\n 9\n\n10   Q.      ON PAGES 25-26 OF HIS SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECT\n\n11           TESTIMONY, MR. POLLOCK ASSERTS THAT THE RIDER CGSC\n\n12           (IMPLEMENTATION           AND ONGOING ADMINISTRATION COSTS)\n\n13           SHOULD APPLY TO COSTS INCURRED ONLY AFTER THAT RIDER IS\n\n14           APPROVED AND THAT ETI IS ALREADY RECOVERING LEGAL AND\n\n15           REGULATORY COSTS RELATED TO THE CGS PROGRAM THROUGH\n\n16           ETI'S BASE RATES. HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n17    A.     ETI is and has been incurring costs to implement the CGS Program since\n\n18           prior to November 10, 2010, which is the date the PUCT severed the CGS\n\n19           Program from Docket No. 37744 to establish this docket. ETI, however, is\n\n20           requesting recovery of its implementation costs only from that November\n\n21            10, 2010 date forward.       There is no way that ETI could put the CGS\n\n22            Program into effect without incurring these implementation costs:      we\n\n23           would not have a proposed tariff, much less completed all of the drafts,\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                                 Page 3 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           analyses, and discussions necessary to work through the myriad complex\n\n2            issues that have brought us just to this point. In addition, TIEC's assumed\n\n3            recovery via base rates in Docket No. 39896 did not begin until June\n\n4            2012, which is long after costs started being incurred. There is no doubt\n\n5            that, under TIEC's approach, these implementation costs would go\n\n6            \"unrecovered\" if ETI were not allowed to collect them. My understanding\n\n 7           is that the PUCT has concluded, on an interim basis, that \"unrecovered\n\n 8           costs\" are the \"costs to implement and administer the CGS program tariff.\"\n\n 9           (Interim Order at page 6.) TIEC's approach would allow only recovery of\n\n10           the costs of administering the tariff.\n\n11                   As to Mr. Pollock's second point, yes, there is an amount\n\n12           attributable to ETI's work on the CGS Program that was used to set\n\n13           current base rates. But ETI is proposing, in its Rider CGSC, to credit the\n\n14           amount used to set current retail base rates ($299,372)2 to the ultimate\n\n15           Rider CGSC rate. For a further discussion about what was included in the\n\n16           setting of base rates and if it is determined that something else should be\n\n17           done, how to avoid rate class subsidy issues, please refer to Section IV of\n\n18           this testimony below where I respond to OPUC's testimony on this issue.\n\n19\n\n\n\n      2 ETI's Rider CGSC should have only credited the retail portion included in base rates of\n         $299,372 because that is the level authorized for recovery in current retail rates and not the\n         full $310,746. The difference between the two figures is the amount allocated to the\n         wholesale class.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  );5\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK CONTENDS THAT THE $1.10 FIXED\n\n2           COST CONTRIBUTION FEE SHOULD BE USED TO REDUCE THE\n\n3           \"UNRECOVERED COSTS,\" THAT IS, THE COSTS TO BE COLLECTED\n\n4           THROUGH RIDER CGSC. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n5    A.     No. I addressed this point in some detail in my Supplemental Direct\n\n6           Testimony.      Mr. Pollock is correct if the PUCT had concluded that\n\n 7          \"unrecovered costs\" included ETI's unrecovered embedded production\n\n 8          costs, but it did not. The fixed cost contribution fee is necessary for ETI\n\n 9           standing ready to provide service to the CGS Customer regardless of\n\n10          whether the Customer's CGS Supplier delivers its contracted supply to\n\n11           ETI. ETI should be allowed to retain this fee in order to at least contribute\n\n12           to, if not cover, the incremental cost incurred by the Company to stand by\n\n13           to serve this load. Staff witness Mendoza came to this same conclusion in\n\n14           his January 25, 2013 testimony by referring to the Agreed List of Settled\n\n15           Issues that state that the Fixed Cost Contribution Fee \"will be applied to\n\n16           offset any production costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation\n\n17           of the CGS tariff.\"3\n\n18\n\n19   Q.      ON PAGE 27, MR. POLLOCK STATES THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO\n\n20           ADDESS HOW ETI WOULD RECOVER ITS RIDER CGSC COSTS IF\n\n21           THERE ARE NO CGS CUSTOMERS.

This is another situation in which TIEC is attempting to put off an important\n\n4             and real issue, and thereby place at risk ETI's ability to recover these\n\n5             costs. Once again, TIEC has responded to an ETI request for information\n\n6             that it does not keep records of which of its members have even\n\n 7            expressed an interest in the CGS Program-TIEC cannot name even one\n\n 8            of its members (also ETI customers and/or Qualifying Facilities \"QFs\")\n\n 9            who are interested.    My attached Exhibit DRR-SR-1 is a copy of TIEC's\n\n10            responses on this point.     Staff witness Mendoza has agreed with ETI's\n\n11            proposal and that \"In the event no customers subscribe to the CGS\n\n12            program, any unrecovered costs should be borne by the customer class it\n\n13            was designed to potentially benefit.\"4 Further, the costs incurred by ETI to\n\n14             implement the CGS Program to date are $945,100 for the period\n\n15             December 2010 through November 2012, which the Company reported to\n\n16            TIEC in response to TIEC 4-4 subpart (a). This response is attached as\n\n17             my Exhibit DRR-SR-2. This value is certainly not di minimis. There is no\n\n18             valid reason to not address this issue now as an important component of\n\n19             the CGS Program.\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n     4 Id. at 9.\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

POLLOCK ALSO ASSERTS THAT ETI\n\n2           SHOULD       NOT     ACCRUE        INTEREST    ON THE UNRECOVERED\n\n3           BALANCE OF THE RIDER CGSC CHARGES. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n4    A.     No.    Mr. Pollock analogizes this requested interest recovery to what he\n\n5           refers to as the typical practice regarding rate case expenses.      This is not\n\n6           a \"typical\" case; it is instead a case subject to a specific statutory provision\n\n 7          that applies only to a CGS Program for ETI. Rider CGSC would recover\n\n 8          the costs that ETI incurs to implement and administer the CGS Program,\n\n 9          which the PUCT has ruled, on an interim basis, that ETI is entitled to\n\n10           recover. There is a time value of money associated with the unrecovered\n\n11           balance of CGSC costs, due to the delay in their recovery, which is\n\n12           addressed by allowing ETI to recover interest on this unrecovered\n\n13           balance. Otherwise, ETI will not be recovering the full amount of these\n\n14           unrecovered costs.\n\n15\n\n16   Q.      ON PAGE 15 AND PRIMARILY PAGES 27 THROUGH 29, MR.\n\n17           POLLOCK        ARGUES         THAT      THE   PROVISION        ADDRESSING\n\n18           \"UNSERVED ENERGY\" SHOULD INCLUDE A PROVISION THAT\n\n19           ALLOWS A CGS CUSTOMER TO REDUCE ITS LOAD TO MATCH A\n\n20           REDUCTION IN CGS SUPPLIERS TO ETI BY THE CGS SUPPLIER. DO\n\n21           YOU AGREE?\n\n22   A.      No.    Mr. Pollock asserts a number of points in an attempt to support\n\n23           TIEC's request to include this \" reduce load to match reduced supplies\"\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 7 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n1           provision. I also addressed this at some length in my Supplemental Direct\n\n2           Testimony, as did Mr. Dingle. The fundamental bottom line is that TIEC's\n\n3           proposal ignores the 24/7 Unit Contingent nature of the CGS product, to\n\n4           which TIEC has agreed.\n\n 5                    In addition, as described in Mr. Dingle's Second Supplemental\n\n 6           Rebuttal Testimony, the Entergy system would purchase the CGS Supply\n\n 7          to satisfy system load. There is no direct link between the CGS Supply\n\n 8           and the CGS Customer load as implied by TIEC. TIEC attempts to make\n\n 9          this connection between CGS Supply and the CGS Customer in order to\n\n10           equate the simultaneous reduction in CGS Supply and CGS Customer\n\n11           load to the simultaneous reduction in host load and host generation\n\n12           associated with the provision of standby service to customer host\n\n13           generation.    These two situations are drastically different as I explain\n\n14           below.\n\n15                    Under Standby service for host generation, Entergy (and ETI) is not\n\n16           purchasing the host generation, rather it is satisfying host load and any\n\n17           excess in generation may or may not be \"put\" to the Company in the form\n\n18           of a QF put. The simultaneous reduction in load and generation happens\n\n19           with a singular customer at a single location, and the Company in all\n\n20           likelihood does not even know, or need to know, that this has occurred.\n\n21           On the other hand, for the CGS Program, the CGS Supplier must have\n\n22           obtained firm transmission service, committed to supply a 24/7 unit\n\n23           contingent product to the Entergy transmission grid as described by Mr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 q\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

If this CGS\n\n3           Supply is suddenly no longer available, Entergy and its other customers\n\n4           will incur a cost to 1) replace this energy source and 2) plan for and\n\n 5          provide standby service whether or not a customer's load (CGS or\n\n 6          otherwise) coincidentally is reduced.\n\n 7\n\n 8   Q      ON PAGE 28, MR. POLLOCK SUGGESTS THAT THE CGS CUSTOMER\n\n 9          WILL HAVE INTERVAL DATA RECORDING METERING IN PLACE SO\n\n10           ETI   SHOULD BE ABLE TO               TELL WHEN THE CUSTOMER IS\n\n11           REDUCING LOAD IN ORDER TO MATCH THE CGS SUPPLY\n\n12           REDUCTION.          DOES THIS STATEMENT FULLY ADDRESS THE\n\n13           BILLING ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH TIEC'S PROPOSAL?\n\n14   A.      No.   This statement makes a rather broad conclusion about \"matching\"\n\n15           that does not address the events that are likely to occur in the real world\n\n16           but instead raises numerous unanswered questions. First, what is the\n\n17           Company supposed to consider for billing if the MW's do not match?\n\n18           Meaning, what if the CGS Supply was reduced by 1,500 kW between two\n\n19           30 minute intervals, but the CGS Customer's load only reduced by 1,000\n\n20           kW.    Is the Company to assume that the supply reduction and load\n\n21           reduction have \"matched\" or is the Company supposed to bill unserved\n\n22           energy for the difference between 1,500 and 1,000?\n\n\n\n\n                                                    lC)\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 9 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1                    Second, what is the Company supposed to consider for billing if the\n\n2           timing doesn't match? If the CGS supply was reduced in one interval but\n\n3           the reduction in CGS Customer load did not occur until two hours later,\n\n4           what is the Company to assume for billing unserved energy under TIEC's\n\n 5          proposal? Is the Company supposed to bill unserved energy for the\n\n 6          intervening two hours?\n\n 7                    Third, what is the Company to assume if either the supply reduction\n\n 8          or the load reduction is not constant or consistent across intervals? For\n\n 9          example, is the Company to charge for unserved energy if the load\n\n10          reduction is a constant 5,000 kW across all hours but the supply reduction\n\n11           is 5,000 kW for half of the hours but 5,100 kW for the other half of the\n\n12           hours.\n\n13                    Fourth, the CGS Program is further complicated by the potential for\n\n14           a CGS Supplier to enter into CGS agreements with multiple CGS\n\n15           Customers.      As discussed in my Supplemental Direct Testimony in the\n\n16           situation of one CGS Supplier has entered into a CGS agreement with\n\n17           multiple CGS Customers, when the CGS Supplier reduces its supply,\n\n18           there is no method for prioritizing the reduction to the multiple Customers,\n\n19           and therefore no method for determining which CGS Customer should\n\n20           avoid unserved energy charges or the level of required reduction. For\n\n21           example, if the CGS Supply was reduced by 10,000 kW and CGS\n\n22           Customer-1 reduced its load by 4,500 kW and CGS Customer-2 reduced\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.                                                      Page 10 of 17\n     Supplemental Rebuttal Testimony of Dennis R. Roach\n     Docket No. 38951\n\n\n 1          its load 3,000 kW, the Company does not know which CGS Customer(s) is\n\n 2          supposed to billed unserved energy and in what quantities.\n\n 3                  Fifth, the Company has no way to determine whether a CGS\n\n4           Customer's reduction in load truly had to do with a reduction in CGS\n\n 5          Supply or a reduction in load for economic reasons. For example, assume\n\n 6          again as in my fourth point immediately above that a single CGS Supplier\n\n 7          that has contracted with two separate CGS Suppliers. Assume the CGS\n\n 8          Customer-2 reduction in load was for economic reasons associated with\n\n 9          the sale of its own product.         Further assume that the CGS Supplier\n\n10          actually never requested CGS Customer-2 to reduce its load, but instead\n\n11          requested that CGS-Customer-1 undertake the full reduction. Under this\n\n12          set of assumptions, CGS Customer-1 should pay unserved energy for the\n\n13          full difference between 10,000 kW and 4,500 kW. From ETI's billing\n\n14           perspective, however, the Company has the exact same metering data\n\n15           under both scenarios (fourth point versus this fifth point) but has no way to\n\n16          discern that difference.\n\n17                  Finally, these issues are not mutually exclusive. For example, the\n\n18           circumstance could be similar to the fifth point above, while at the same\n\n19          time, the timing of the reductions does not match (second point above)\n\n20           and the kW values do not match (first point above).\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n                                                 t-Z^\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

IS THE RECOVERY OF CGS COSTS SUBJECT TO\n\n11          TRADITIONAL TEST YEAR RATE MAKING?\n\n12   A.      No. The recovery of CGS implementation cost is subject to the specific\n\n13           provisions in PURA §39.452(b), which states in part:\n\n14                  The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be considered\n15                  to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section 36.007, and\n16                  [ETI's] rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff\n17                  is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of\n18                  the implementation of the tariff.\n19\n20                  A common definition of the word \" implement\" is to \"CARRY OUT,\n\n21           ACCOMPLISH; esp : to give practical effect to and ensure actual\n\n22           fulfillment by concrete measures....\"5 Substituting the definitional phrase\n\n23           into the statutory word \"implementation\" results in: \"...to recover any costs\n\n24           unrecovered as a result of giving practical effect to and ensuring actual\n\n25           fulfillment by concrete measures of the tariff.\" ETI cannot give \"practical\n\n     5 MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 582 (101h ed. 2002).\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHAT IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE AMOUNTS BEING BILLED\n\n10          CUSTOMERS FOR CGS IMPLEMENTATION COSTS CURRENTLY IN\n\n11          BASE RATES?\n\n12   A.     Using the residential rate class as an example, a typical residential\n\n13          customer using 1,000 kWh per month would be paying less than\n\n14          $0.03/month.6\n\n15\n\n16   Q.     ON PAGES 5 AND 8, OPUC WITNESS BENEDICT SUGGESTS THAT A\n\n17          ONCE-ANNUAL REFUND IS THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION TO CREDIT\n\n18          CUSTOMER CLASSES FOR THE AMOUNT BEING BILLED IN BASE\n\n19           RATES. DO YOU AGREE?\n\n20   A.      No. At the outset, in Docket No. 39896, the Commission authorized ETI to\n\n21           recover, through base rates, the charges to the Company's project code\n\n     6 Residential $159,946 shown on the Company's response to OPUC RFI 2-2 divided by\n        Residential 5,577,331,000 kWh (Docket No. 38986, Staff Cost of service number running\n        model, Schedule Q-7) times 1,000 kWh/month equals approximately $0.029/month.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

OPC's proposal would\n\n 2          circumvent that ruling by requiring a refund of those base rate charges to\n\n 3          all but the LIPS class.       Further, the class-based figures cited by Mr.\n\n 4          Benedict in his testimony (which were provided to OPUC through the\n\n 5          Company's response to OPUC RFI 2-2) were based on ETI's cost of\n\n 6          service model, which is an approximation of the Staff's number running\n\n 7          model. But Staff's number running model does not provide the detail or\n\n 8          functionality to segregate the CGS-related charges by customer class, and\n\n 9          a number of different allocation factors were used to allocate the CGS\n\n10          project code costs in Docket No. 39896.            Therefore, there is an\n\n11          unavoidable imprecision in those figures.\n\n12                  However, if the PUCT wants to attempt to remove customer class\n\n13          subsidies ( both inter and intra class), even given the imprecision\n\n14          described above for this portion of the Rider CGSC charge, then the\n\n15          appropriate method to address these class subsidies would be to have a\n\n16          separate rider that would essentially negate the amount included in base\n\n17          rates for CGS service, but also implement a mechanism to ensure that ETI\n\n18          then recovers this full amount via Rider CGSC. The rate for this credit\n\n19          rider would be developed by rate class using the rate class dollar amounts\n\n20          referenced in ETI's response to OPUC RFI 2-2 and included in the table\n\n21          on page 8 of Mr. Benedict's testimony divided by the billing determinants\n\n22          used to set rates in Docket No. 39896. The table below shows this credit\n\n23          rate to remove the CGS billing via base rates going forward.

IF THIS CREDIT RIDER APPROACH IS TAKEN, WHAT OTHER\n\n 7           CHANGES ARE REQUIRED?\n\n 8   A.      The Rider CGSC filed by the Company would need to have the $310,746\n\n 9           credit currently reflected in this rider removed because customers would\n\n10           effectively be receiving this credit via the credit rider.'              But as stated\n\n11           above, the Rider CGSC rate would then need to ensure that the full\n\n12           amount of implementation costs, including the $299,372, is recovered so\n\n\n\n     ' Again, ETI's Rider CGSC should have only credited the retail portion included in base rates of\n         $299,372 because that is the level reflected in current retail rates and not the full $310,746.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    iI\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

WHY IS THE USE OF A CREDIT RIDER PREFERRED TO OPUC'S\n\n 5          PROPOSAL?\n\n 6   A.     Again, if the PUCT concludes that an attempt to remove class subsidies\n\n 7          should be made, there are a number of reasons. First, the credit rider\n\n 8          truly is the simplest approach in that this credit rider simply removes what\n\n 9          is included in base rates and it stays in effect as long as rates from Docket\n\n10          No. 39896 are in effect. Second, this approach treats all rate classes the\n\n11          same.    Third, this also simplifies Rider CGSC to just recover the CGS\n\n12          implementation and administration costs and not deal with either prior\n\n13          periods or on-going credit amounts.           Fourth, this proposal accurately\n\n14          removes any perceived customer subsidy in that the base rate charge is\n\n15          effectively removed. Fifth, this proposal not only removes any perceived\n\n16          inter-class subsidies but it also removes any intra-class subsidy. By giving\n\n17          the LIPS class a credit just like other classes and then charging the CGS\n\n18          participants the Rider CGSC costs, intra-class subsidies within the LIPS\n\n19          rate class are removed. In comparison, OPUC's proposal is overly\n\n20          complicated by once-annual refunds and continues to have an intra-class\n\n21          subsidy within the LIPS rate class.\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n                                               ^4\n\f     Entergy Texas, Inc.

HOW DO YOU RESPOND?\n\n 7   A.     First, I note that Cities filed a Motion to Strike the Rider CGSUSC\n\n 8          references and discussion in my Supplemental Direct, as well as striking\n\n 9          Rider CGSUSC attached as an exhibit to that testimony. The Company\n\n10          has filed a response in opposition to Cities' Motion to Strike. As discussed\n\n11          in the Company's response to Cities, Rider CGSUSC (and references to\n\n12          that Rider in my Supplemental Direct Testimony) should not be struck\n\n13          because that proposed Rider CGSUSC and referenced passages in\n\n14          testimony are presented to establish a complete evidentiary record on the\n\n15          issue of what are unrecovered costs, and ETI's consistent position is that\n\n16          it is a Commission policy call as to which customers are responsible for\n\n17          reimbursing ETI for its unrecovered costs.\n\n18\n\n19                                     VI.

Correct?\n 3       A      (Pollock)   The company is going to know pretty\n 4   far in advance, before the signing of the contract, that\n 5   there's a good -- at least the likelihood that there's a\n 6   resource out there, and I don't think that's going to go\n 7   totally unnoticed in the planning process.\n 8                   I mean, the company executes year,\n 9   two-year, three-year extensions of existing contracts\n10   that they might not otherwise have to do if they know\n11   that they're close to getting a CGS resource in place,\n12   within the time window, which requires that the\n13   contract, I think, has to be in place by at least April\n14   or before the summer.     So that gives the company plenty\n15   of -- and you're going to know in advance that customers\n16   are going through this process, so it's not going to be\n17   a total unknown.\n18       Q      Well, that's not my question.   My question is,\n19   the company has capacity costs that it incurs on its\n20   power plants like River Bend.\n21       A      (Pollock)   Yes.\n22       Q      And the fact that it enters into a CGS contract\n23   for a couple of years will have no tendency to reduce\n24   the capacity costs its paying for River Bend at all.\n25   Right?\n\n                  KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                            512.474.2233\n\f                                                          Page 181\n\n 1       A    (Pollock)     It's not intended to.   As I said,\n 2   the CGS program right now would replace a limited-term,\n 3   PPA, purchased power agreement.     So, yeah, it could\n 4   certainly def er an extension or brand new PPA from being\n 5   entered into, and that's really the point.\n 6       Q    But if the contract is for, say, three years,\n 7   and no longer than five years, it's not going to cause\n 8   the company to alter any of its obligations that are\n 9   long-term contracts.     Correct?   They would be the same?\n10       A    (Pollock)     No, but on the margins, when the\n11   company, you know, enters into numerous limited-term\n12   agreements, as they've had, it's going to affect those\n13   agreements.\n14                   I mean, you know, let's not put, you know,\n15   CGS as trying to replace a 30- or 40-year resource.         You\n16   know, maybe it eventually will do that, but for the\n17   short run, as long as the company is relying on these\n18   limited-term purchases, that's where we can defer -- and\n19   those purchases -- those costs, as Mr. May points out,\n20   keep going up, that's where we can do some good and help\n21   out the customers.\n22       Q    But it would simply be a matter, though, of\n23   what -- if you have a short-term CGS contract, what it\n24   can displace will depend on what the company has in its\n25   portfolio at the time the CGS contract is entered into.\n\n                   KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                             512.474.2233\n\f                                                          Page 182\n\n 1   Right?\n 2       A    (Pollock)    Sure; sure, it does.\n 3       Q    We don't know what that will be at this point?\n 4       A    (Pollock)    You know what your portfolio is.\n 5   You know for all the limited-term contracts.     You have a\n 6   start date, an end date.    The question is, is there\n 7   going to be an extension if we need it or not, and\n 8   that's where you could potentially affect the process.\n 9       Q    But we don't know when the CGS contract will be\n10   entered into?\n11       A    (Pollock)    We don't.\n12       Q    Okay.     Is it your contention or TIEC's\n13   contention that any amount of unrecovered costs, no\n14   matter how small, will undermine the program?\n15       A    (Pollock)     I think to the extent that a CGS\n16   customer is going to incur some unrecovered costs -- and\n17   that's an issue.     I can't say how much of unrecovered\n18   costs would either dissuade that customer from not\n19   entering a CGS contract or not because I'm not in a\n20   position to know that.\n21                    But I think the more pressure you put and\n22   the more hurdles you put on the program like that, I\n23   think less likely the program will work.     Maybe it will\n24   work for some customers but not as many customers as\n25   would otherwise be the case.\n\n                 KENNEDY REPORTING SERVICE, INC.\n                           512.474.2233\n\f                 SOAH DOCKET NO.

Yes.    The CGS-USC rider will allow the company to flow through unrecovered\n\n2         embedded cost to other customer classes.       The unrecovered costs are defined as the\n\n3         difference between the revenue paid as a CGS customer and the revenues which would\n\n4         have been collected by ETI ifthe CGS customer had remained a standard LIPS customer.\n\n5         If all LIPS customers opted for CGS service, the unrecovered costs would be $57.5\n\n6         million. 87 Furthermore, the \"lost revenue method\" used in the CGS-USC tariff may not\n\n7         be equivalent to \"unrecovered costs,\" which is the term used in the statute.\n\n 8   Q.   WHY IS \"LOST REVENUE\" DIFFERENT FROM \"UNRECOVERED COST?\"\n\n 9   A.   Revenues are intended to equal embedded cost of service for the adjusted test-year.\n\n10        However, revenues may depart from costs, either higher or lower, as the time frame\n\n11        advances further from the test-year.      Moreover, the loss of individual customers'\n\n12        revenues does not mean that the underlying costs are ''unrecovered.\" For instance, the\n\n13        generating capacity which served the departing customers can be redirected to other\n\n14        revenue producing uses, such as selling power into the wholesale market.\n\n15   Q.   CAN YOU FORESEE ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE RE-ENTRY OF\n\n16        FORMER CGS CUSTOMERS IMPOSES UNFAIR IMPACTS ON NON-\n\n17        PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS?\n\n18   A.   Yes. Bundled utility pricing tends to be more stable and less volatile than market pricing\n\n19        because rates are based upon average costs   ~stead   of marginal costs. Customers will be\n\n20        attracted to CGS service when market prices are lower than the utility's average costs.\n\n\n          87\n               May Direct Testimony at 14.\n\n\n                                                      Redacted Direct Testimony of Clarence Johnson\n                                                     On Behalf of the Office of Public Utility Counsel\n                                                SOAH Docket No. XXX-XX-XXXX; PUC Docket No. 37744\n                                                                                       Page 88 of 115\n\f                                                                                                                                                    TIEC EXHIBIT NO. 15\n\n                       PUC DOCKET NO. 38951\n\n\nAPPLICATION OF ENTERGY                                                         §\nTEXAS, INC.

UNRECOVERED COSTS FROM THE CGS PROGRAM\n\n   1\t   Q\t     WHY IS THE ISSUE OF THE DEFINITION OF \"UNRECOVERED COSTS\" BEING\n   2\t          ADDRESSED IN THIS PROCEEDING?\n   3\t   A\t     PURA § 39.452(b) provides that ETI's rates \"shall be set, in the proceeding in which\n   4\t          the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the\n   5\t          implementation of the tariff.\" ETI and TIEC do not agree about what \"costs\" this\n   6\t          refers to. Just as ETI and other utilities unsuccessfully argued with respect to energy\n   7\t          efficiency program costs, ETI claims the reference to \"costs\" would allow it to recover\n   8\t          not just its actual expenditures in implementing a CGS Program but also hypothetical\n   9\t          lost revenues ETI may have received if all CGS Customers paid ETI's full firm rate\n  10\t          instead. ETI's proposed Rider CGSUSC clearly states that it \"defines the procedure\n  11\t          by which Entergy Texas, Inc. ('Company') shall implement and adjust rates for\n  12\t          recovery of lost base rate revenue resulting from customers participating in the\n  13\t          Company's Competitive Generation Service ('CGS Program').\"' (emphasis added)\n\n  14 Definition of Unrecovered Costs\n  15\t   Q\t     HOW SHOULD UNRECOVERED COSTS BE DEFINED?\n16\t     A\t     Unrecovered costs should not include ETI's hypothetical lost revenues. If a CGS\n  17\t          tariff is adopted, the costs that could be unrecovered as a result of implementation of\n  18\t          the tariff should include the expenditures actually incurred by ETI to implement and\n\n\n\n\n        1 Docket No. 37744, ETI Ex. 9 at Exhibit PRM-1.\n\n                                                          3.
