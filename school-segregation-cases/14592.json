Markwell, 2012-Ohio-3096.]\n\n\nGwin, P.J.\n\n        {¶1}     On August 26, 2011, a jury found appellant Alan H. Markwell [“Markwell”]\n\nguilty of one count of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition. On September\n\n24, 2011, Markwell returned to court for sentencing. The trial court ordered that\n\nMarkwell serve a mandatory prison sentence of ten (10) years on the rape count; a\n\nprison term of eighteen (18) months on the count of gross sexual imposition; and a\n\nprison term of five (5) years on the second count of gross sexual imposition. The\n\nsentences ordered for rape and the count of gross sexual imposition involving the same\n\nvictim are to be served concurrent with one another, but consecutive to the sentence\n\nordered for the gross sexual imposition count involving a different victim, for an\n\naggregate prison term of fifteen (15) years. Markwell was also designated as a Tier Ill\n\nsexual offender.\n\n                                         Facts and Procedural History\n\n        {¶2}     On April 25, 2011, C.T. a minor reported that she had been touched by\n\nher step-grandfather, Markwell. She told officers that Markwell had touched her on\n\nseven different occasions while she visited her grandmother between June 2008 and\n\nJune 2010. C.T. reported that Markwell would come into the room where she and her\n\nsister were sleeping and push his fingers up inside her vagina. She also reported that\n\nMarkwell also attempted to do the same thing to her sister, D.T., who would sleep\n\nthrough the incident.\n\n        {¶3}     Between April 23, and April 25, 2011, C.T. engaged in a texting\n\nconversation with Markwell in which she attempted to get him to admit this conduct. In\n\none text, Markwell wrote that he loved her and that he was making love to her.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                    3\n\n\n       {¶4}   Upon investigation of these allegations, officers spoke to M. H., then eight\n\n(8) years old, who reported that approximately a year earlier, Markwell had touched her\n\non her private area.\n\n       {¶5}   Markwell was interviewed by detectives and denied the allegations. In the\n\ndefense case, Markwell testified and denied the allegations. He further testified that\n\nM.H., age 8, was sexually adventurous or promiscuous in that she would try to touch\n\nadults on their privates. He further testified about the great relationship that he had with\n\nall of his wife's grandchildren. In regards to the computer messaging, he testified that\n\nhis wife's grandchildren had access to the computer during the time in question and\n\nblamed them for fabricating the conversations testified to by C. T. He also testified that\n\nC. T. had a motive to lie about the charges because he had threatened to tell her\n\nparents about a secret boyfriend of hers.\n\n                                      Assignments of Error\n\n       {¶6}   Markwell raises six assignments of error,\n\n       {¶7}   “I. THE CONVICTION IS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND IS\n\nOTHERWISE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE IN VIOLATION\n\nOF OHIO LAW AND THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n       {¶8}   “II. THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE INSUFFICIENT IN VIOLATION\n\nOF OHIO LAW AND THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n       {¶9}   “III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN JOINING OFFENSES IN VIOLATION\n\nOF OHIO LAW AND THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n       {¶10} “IV.

THE    TRIAL    COURT      ERRED     IN   FAILING    TO    SUPPRESS\n\nSTATEMENTS OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF APPELLANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL\n\nRIGHTS IN VIOLATION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n      {¶12} “VI. APPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS BY STRUCTURAL\n\nCUMULATIVE ERROR IN VIOLATION OF OHIO LAW AND THE STATE AND\n\nFEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS.”\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n                                                I.\n\n      {¶13} Markwell challenges his convictions for rape and gross sexual imposition\n\nbecause he contends that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he\n\nwas not married to the victims at the time of the offenses and further that the record\n\ncontains insufficient proof that he penetrated the victim to support a conviction for rape.\n\nMarkwell further argues that all of his convictions were against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence.\n\n      {¶14} Our review of the constitutional sufficiency of evidence to support a\n\ncriminal conviction is governed by Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct.\n\n2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), which requires a court of appeals to determine whether\n\n“after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.” Id.; see also McDaniel v. Brown, _U.S._, 130 S.Ct. 665, 673, 175 L.Ed.2d\n\n582(2010) (reaffirming this standard); State v. Fry, 125 Ohio St.3d 163, 926 N.E.2d\n\n1239, 2010–Ohio–1017, ¶ 146; State v. Clay, 187 Ohio App.3d 633, 933 N.E.2d 296,\n\n2010–Ohio–2720, ¶ 68.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                        5\n\n\n       {¶15} Weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of inducing belief.\n\nState v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), superseded\n\nby constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated by State v. Smith, 80 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668, 1997-Ohio–355. Weight of the evidence concerns “the\n\ninclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one\n\nside of the issue rather than the other. It indicates clearly to the jury that the party\n\nhaving the burden of proof will be entitled to their verdict, if, on weighing the evidence in\n\ntheir minds, they shall find the greater amount of credible evidence sustains the issue\n\nwhich is to be established before them. Weight is not a question of mathematics, but\n\ndepends on its effect in inducing belief.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541,\n\nquoting Black's at 1594.\n\n       {¶16} When a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis\n\nthat the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a\n\n“’thirteenth juror’” and disagrees with the fact finder’s resolution of the conflicting\n\ntestimony. Id. at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102\n\nS.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). However, an appellate court may not merely\n\nsubstitute its view for that of the jury, but must find that “‘the jury clearly lost its way and\n\ncreated such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and\n\na new trial ordered.’” State v. Thompkins, supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, quoting State v.\n\nMartin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720–721(1st Dist. 1983).\n\nAccordingly, reversal on manifest weight grounds is reserved for “‘the exceptional case\n\nin which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’” Id.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 6\n\n\n              “[I]n determining whether the judgment below is manifestly against\n\n       the weight of the evidence, every reasonable intendment and every\n\n       reasonable presumption must be made in favor of the judgment and the\n\n       finding of facts. * * *\n\n              “If the evidence is susceptible of more than one construction, the\n\n       reviewing court is bound to give it that interpretation which is consistent\n\n       with the verdict and judgment, most favorable to sustaining the verdict and\n\n       judgment.”\n\nSeasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273 (1984), fn.\n\n3, quoting 5 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Appellate Review, Section 60, at 191–192 (1978).\n\n       {¶17} In the case at bar, Markwell was found guilty of one count of rape. More\n\nparticularly, R.C. 2907.02 states:\n\n              (A)(1) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who\n\n       is not the spouse of the offender or who is the spouse of the offender but\n\n       is living separate and apart from the offender, when any of the following\n\n       applies:\n\n              ***\n\n              (b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether or\n\n       not the offender knows the age of the other person.\n\n              (c) The other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially\n\n       impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of\n\n       advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to\n\n       believe that the other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 7\n\n\n      impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of\n\n      advanced age.\n\n             ***\n\n      {¶18} Markwell was also found guilty of two counts of gross sexual imposition in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.05 which states:\n\n             (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the\n\n      spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to\n\n      have sexual contact with the offender; or cause two or more other persons\n\n      to have sexual contact when any of the following applies:\n\n             ***\n\n             (5) The ability of the other person to resist or consent or the ability\n\n      of one of the other persons to resist or consent is substantially impaired\n\n      because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age,\n\n      and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the ability\n\n      to resist or consent of the other person or of one of the other persons is\n\n      substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or\n\n      because of advanced age.\n\n      {¶19} Markwell argues there is a complete absence of proof of non-marriage\n\nbetween him and the girls an essential element of each charge.\n\n      {¶20} In the present case, each victim testified that Markwell was her \"step-\n\ngrandpa.\" C.T. also indicated that she was sixteen (16) years old, lives with her parents\n\nand sister and brother, and attends the eleventh grade at Newark High School.\n\nSimilarly, M. H. identified Charlotte Markwell as her grandma and Markwell as her\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                  8\n\n\n\"grandpa.\" M. H. also indicated that she was nine (9) years old, lives with her mommy\n\nand daddy, and attends the third grade at Adamsville Elementary School.\n\n       {¶21} Markwell himself testified extensively concerning his family history and\n\nrelationships including his first and second marriages. During this testimony, he did not\n\nclaim that he was married to either of his victims.\n\n       {¶22} Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we\n\nconclude that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nMarkwell was not married to either C.T. or M.H.\n\n       {¶23} Markwell next argues that there was insufficient proof of penetration.\n\n       {¶24} In order to convict Markwell of rape, the state had to prove he engaged in\n\nsexual conduct with C.T. “Sexual conduct” is defined to include “vaginal intercourse\n\nbetween a male and female; anal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus between persons\n\nregardless of sex; and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any\n\npart of the body or any instrument, apparatus, or other object into the vaginal or anal\n\ncavity of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal\n\nintercourse.” R.C. 2907.01(A).\n\n       {¶25} In the case at bar, C.T. testified that the Markwell penetrated her vagina to\n\nthe depth of a fingernail. “Corroboration of victim testimony in rape cases is not\n\nrequired.” State v. Johnson, 112 Ohio St .3d 210, 217, 2006-Ohio6404 at ¶ 53, 858\n\nN.E.2d 1144, 1158.\n\n       {¶26} Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we\n\nconclude that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nMarkwell had committed the crime of rape. We hold, therefore, that the state met its\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                  9\n\n\nburden of production regarding each element of the crime of rape and, accordingly,\n\nthere was sufficient evidence to support Markwell's conviction.\n\n      {¶27} The weight to be given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses\n\nare issues for the trier of fact. State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d\n\n212(1967), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-\n\nOhio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶118. Accord, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80,\n\n62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680(1942); Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 434, 103 S.Ct.\n\n843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983).\n\n             A fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is that ‘the jury is\n\n             the lie detector.’ United States v. Barnard, 490 F.2d 907, 912 (9th\n\n             Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 959, 94 S.Ct. 1976, 40 L.Ed.2d\n\n             310 (1974). Determining the weight and credibility of witness\n\n             testimony, therefore, has long been held to be the ‘part of every\n\n             case [that] belongs to the jury, who [is] presumed to be fitted for it\n\n             by [his or her] natural intelligence and... practical knowledge of men\n\n             and the ways of men.’ Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 140 U.S. 76, 88,\n\n             11 S.Ct. 720, 724-725, 35 L.Ed. 371 (1891).\n\nUnited States v. Scheffer (1997), 523 U.S. 303, 313, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 1266-1267(1997).\n\n      {¶28} Although Markwell cross-examined the witnesses and argued that his\n\ncomputer was hacked, that C.T. had threatened him if he told her parents about her\n\nsecret boyfriend and that each child had been sexualized in their own homes, the\n\nweight to be given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are issues for the\n\ntrier of fact. State v. Jamison, 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 552 N.E.2d 180(1990).\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 10\n\n\n      {¶29} The jury was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by\n\nthe parties and assess the witness’s credibility. \"While the jury may take note of the\n\ninconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do\n\nnot render defendant's conviction against the manifest weight or sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.\" State v. Craig, 10th Dist. No. 99AP-739, 1999 WL 29752 (Mar 23, 2000)\n\nciting State v. Nivens, 10th Dist. No. 95APA09-1236, 1996 WL 284714 (May 28, 1996).\n\nIndeed, the jury need not believe all of a witness' testimony, but may accept only\n\nportions of it as true. State v. Raver, Franklin App. No. 02AP-604, 2003- Ohio-958, ¶ 21,\n\nciting State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964); State v. Burke, 10th\n\nDist. No. 02AP-1238, 2003-Ohio-2889, citing State v. Caldwell, 79 Ohio App.3d 667,\n\n607 N.E.2d 1096 (4th Dist. 1992). Although the evidence may have been circumstantial,\n\nwe note that circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence.\n\nState v. Jenks, supra.\n\n      {¶30} In Cross v. Ledford, 161 Ohio St. 469, 477, 120 N.E. 2d 118 (1954), the\n\nSupreme Court further cautioned,\n\n      The mere number of witnesses, who may support a claim of one or the\n\n      other of the parties to an action, is not to be taken as a basis for resolving\n\n      disputed facts. The degree of proof required is determined by the\n\n      impression which the testimony of the witnesses makes upon the trier of\n\n      facts, and the character of the testimony itself. Credibility, intelligence,\n\n      freedom from bias or prejudice, opportunity to be informed, the disposition\n\n      to tell the truth or otherwise, and the probability or improbability of the\n\n      statements made, are all tests of testimonial value. Where the evidence is\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 11\n\n       in conflict, the trier of facts may determine what should be accepted as the\n\n       truth and what should be rejected as false. See Rice v. City of Cleveland,\n\n       114 Ohio St. 299, 58 N.E.2d 768.\n\n161 Ohio St. at 477-478. (Emphasis added).\n\n       {¶31} We find that this is not an “‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs\n\nheavily against the conviction.’” Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d\n\n541, quoting Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 N.E.2d 717. The jury heard the\n\nwitnesses, evaluated the evidence, and was convinced of appellant's guilt. The jury\n\nneither lost their way nor created a miscarriage of justice in convicting Markwell.\n\n       {¶32} Markwell’s first assignment of error is overruled in its entirety.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       {¶33} In his second assignment of error, Markwell argues that the trial court\n\nfailed to properly instruct the jury on the meaning of “penetration” required to sustain a\n\nconviction for rape.\n\n       {¶34} Crim.R. 30(A) governs instructions and states as follows:\n\n              At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial\n\n       as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the\n\n       court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests. Copies shall\n\n       be furnished to all other parties at the time of making the requests. The\n\n       court shall inform counsel of its proposed action on the requests prior to\n\n       counsel's arguments to the jury and shall give the jury complete\n\n       instructions after the arguments are completed. The court also may give\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                     12\n\n\n       some or all of its instructions to the jury prior to counsel's arguments. The\n\n       court need not reduce its instructions to writing.\n\n              On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure\n\n       to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to\n\n       consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the\n\n       grounds of the objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection\n\n       out of the hearing of the jury.\n\n       {¶35} In Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d\n\n35(1999), the United State Supreme Court held that because the failure to properly\n\ninstruct the jury is not in most instances structural error, the harmless-error rule of\n\nChapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 applies to a failure to\n\nproperly instruct the jury, for it does not necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair or\n\nan unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. Accordingly, an erroneous jury\n\ninstruction that omits an element of the offense is subject to harmless-error analysis. Id.\n\nat 15, 119 S.Ct. at 1837.\n\n       {¶36} On August 23, 2011, Markwell did file a written request for jury instructions\n\nin the case at bar. Of relevance, Markwell asked that the jury be instructed as follows,\n\n“Sexual Conduct means insertion however slight of any part of the body into the vaginal\n\ncavity of another.” Thus, Markwell failed to request a more specific jury instruction\n\ndefining “penetration.”\n\n       {¶37} The trial court instructed the jury in relevant part, “the insertion, however\n\nslight, of any part of the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the\n\nvaginal or anal cavity of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 13\n\n\nvaginal or anal intercourse.” Thus, the trial court gave the jury the instruction that\n\nMarkwell had requested at that time.\n\n       {¶38} On appeal, Markwell contends that the trial court was required to define\n\n“penetration” as the spreading of the vaginal lips. E.g., State v. Melendez, 9th Dist. No.\n\n08CA009477, 2009-Ohio-4425; State v. Lucas, 2nd Dist. No. 18644, 2001-Ohio-1350.\n\n       {¶39} As noted in our disposition of Markwell’s first assignment of error, under\n\nthe circumstances of the case at bar, there is nothing in the record to show that the he\n\nwas prejudiced by the failure to give the instruction that Markwell now claims the trial\n\ncourt should have given. C.T. testified and demonstrated for the jury that penetration did\n\nin fact occur,\n\n       Q. And I want to talk about the word penetration. Do you know what I\n\n       mean when I say penetration?\n\n       [C.T.] Yes.\n\n       Q. And can you tell me what you think I mean?\n\n       A. Like pushing.\n\n       Q. Did you say pushed in?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q. Did you feel anything inside you?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q. Demonstrate what you felt.\n\n       A. It’s like (Indicating) just like the tip of your nail.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                     14\n\n\n       Q. Your fingernail?\n\n       A. Yeah.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q. Did you demonstrate with your fingernail it was inside?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n1T. at 126-127. Thus, C.H. testified that Markwell’s finger penetrated her vaginal cavity.\n\nAccordingly, we find any error in the instructions to the jury was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n       {¶40} Markwell’s second assignment of error is overruled in its entirety.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       {¶41} In his third assignment of error, Markwell argues that the charges against\n\nhim should have been severed and tried in two separate proceedings one for C.T. and\n\nthe second for M.H. At the outset, we note that Markwell did not move to sever the\n\ncounts for trial; nor did appellant object to the joinder of the cases for trial. Accordingly,\n\nour review is limited to finding plain error.\n\n       {¶42} Crim. R. 52(B) provides that, “[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial\n\nrights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.”\n\n       {¶43} “[A]n appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at\n\ntrial only where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is\n\nclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; (3) the error affected the\n\nappellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome\n\nof the district court proceedings; and (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” United States v. Marcus, 560 U.S.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 15\n\n\n__, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2010 WL 2025203 (May 24, 2010). (Internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted). Accord, State v. Wamsley, 117 Ohio St.3d 388, 2008-Ohio-1195, 884\n\nN.E.2d 45, ¶28.\n\n       {¶44} Joinder is appropriate where the evidence is interlocking and the jury is\n\ncapable of segregating the proof required for each offense. State v. Czajka, 101 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 564, 577-578, 656 N.E.2d 9 (1995). Nonetheless, if it appears that a criminal\n\ndefendant would be prejudiced by such joinder, then the trial court is required to order\n\nseparate trials. Crim.R. 14.\n\n       {¶45} Prejudice is not demonstrated if one offense would have been admissible\n\nas \"other acts\" evidence under Evid.R. 404(B) or if the evidence of each crime joined at\n\ntrial is simple and direct. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293(1990).\n\nAs long as used for purposes other than proving that the accused acted in conformity\n\nwith a particular character trait, Evid.R. 404(B) permits the admission of \"other acts\"\n\nevidence if it is \"related to and share[s] common features with the crime in question.\"\n\nState v. Lowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616(1994), paragraph one of the\n\nsyllabus. In particular, evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is admissible under this\n\nrule if the evidence shows \"proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\n\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Evidence of other crimes,\n\nwrongs or acts is inadmissible merely to show that an accused has the propensity to\n\ncommit crime. Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n       {¶46} When a defendant claims that he or she was prejudiced by the joinder of\n\nmultiple offenses, the court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts were severed; and (2) if not, whether the\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 16\n\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct. State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59,\n\n600 N.E.2d 661(1992), citing State v. Hamblin, 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 158-159, 524 N.E.2d\n\n476(1988) and Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85(D.C.Cir. 1964). \"If the evidence of\n\nother crimes would be admissible at separate trials, any 'prejudice that might result from\n\nthe jury's hearing the evidence of the other crime in a joint trial would be no different\n\nfrom that possible in separate trials,' and a court need not inquire further.\" Schaim,\n\nsupra. quoting Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d at 90. Accordingly, we must determine\n\nthe extent to which evidence of each of these crimes would be admissible in other trials\n\nif the counts were severed.\n\n      {¶47} In discussing the dangers associated with admitting other acts evidence in\n\na case where the offenses included several counts of rape and gross sexual imposition,\n\nthe Schaim court stated:\n\n      The admissibility of other acts evidence is carefully limited because of the\n\n      substantial danger that the jury will convict the defendant solely because it\n\n      assumes that the defendant has a propensity to commit criminal acts, or\n\n      deserves punishment regardless of whether he or she committed the\n\n      crime charged in the indictment. * * * This danger is particularly high when\n\n      the other acts are very similar to the charged offense, or of an\n\n      inflammatory nature, as is certainly true in this case. The legislature has\n\n      recognized the problems raised by the admission of other acts evidence in\n\n      prosecutions for sexual offenses, and has carefully limited the\n\n      circumstances in which evidence of the defendant's other sexual activity is\n\n      admissible. The forcible rape statute and the gross sexual imposition\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                   17\n\n\n       statute both contain subsections that address the admissibility of evidence\n\n       of other sexual activity by either the victim or the defendant. * * *\n\n65 Ohio St.3d at 59-60, 600 N.E.2d 661.\n\n       {¶48} From our review of the evidence, we find: 1) the acts were against family\n\nmembers, 2) the acts occurred when the children stayed overnight at a residence where\n\nMarkwell was present and 3) all the acts occurred when the children were sleeping.\n\nState v. Ickes, 5th Dist. No. 1999AP080052, 2000 WL 874728 (June 13, 2000). These\n\nfacts clearly indicate a \"scheme, plan or system\" negating any claim of accident. Id.\n\nFurther, the acts were consecutive in nature, beginning with C.T. and following through\n\nto M.H. Each victim testified separately. The issues were clearly laid out for the jury, and\n\nthe jury was instructed that each count and victim should be considered from its own\n\nevidence.\n\n       {¶49} Assuming, arguendo, that the evidence did not fit the \"other acts\"\n\nexception, it nevertheless fits the second prong of the Schaim test which requires the\n\nevidence of the crime under each indictment to be simple and distinct. 65 Ohio St.3d at\n\n59. In State v. Decker, 88 Ohio App.3d 544, 624 N.E.2d 350(1993) the court found that\n\nthe evidence was simple and distinct. The evidence achieved these characteristics in\n\npart because the crimes involved contained different victims and different witnesses,\n\nand therefore, the jury was able to segregate the facts that constituted each crime. Id. at\n\n549.\n\n       {¶50} In this case, the prosecution introduced evidence of each distinct crime.\n\nBoth C.T. and M.H. testified at length and in specific detail about how the abuse\n\noccurred, when it began, and how long it continued. Thus, as in Decker, the evidence\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                    18\n\n\nwas simple and distinct because the facts surrounding each crime were capable of\n\nsegregation.\n\n       {¶51} Accordingly, because Markwell was not able to demonstrate that he was\n\nprejudiced by the joinder of claims, he cannot meet the first element of the Schaim test.\n\nTherefore, we do not need to address the remaining elements of the test.\n\n       {¶52} Given the facts sub judice, we find no plain error affecting Markwell's\n\nsubstantial rights.\n\n       {¶53} Accordingly, Markwell’s third assignment of error is denied.\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       {¶54} In his fourth assignment of error, Markwell claims that his trial counsel was\n\nineffective for 1).failing to move of acquittal based upon the failure of the state to\n\npresent evidence that Markwell was not married to either of the victims; 2).failing to\n\nrequest a specific jury instruction on the meaning of “penetration” as it refers to a rape\n\ncharge and 3). failing to move for a severance of the charges before trial.\n\n       {¶55} A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a two-prong analysis.\n\nThe first inquiry is whether counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonable representation involving a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's\n\nessential duties to appellant. The second prong is whether the appellant was prejudiced\n\nby counsel's ineffectiveness. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct.\n\n2052(1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373(1989).\n\n       {¶56} In order to warrant a finding that trial counsel was ineffective, the petitioner\n\nmust meet both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland and\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                               19\n\nBradley. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U.S. 111, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1419, 173 L.Ed.2d\n\n251(2009).\n\n      {¶57} To show deficient performance, appellant must establish that “counsel’s\n\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious\n\nthat counsel was not functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n\nAmendment. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Counsel also has a duty to\n\nbring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial\n\ntesting process. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052 at 2065.\n\n      Thus, a court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the\n\n      reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the\n\n      particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel's conduct. A convicted\n\n      defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts\n\n      or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of\n\n      reasonable professional judgment. The court must then determine\n\n      whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions\n\n      were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. In\n\n      making that determination, the court should keep in mind that counsel's\n\n      function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the\n\n      adversarial testing process work in the particular case. At the same time,\n\n      the court should recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have\n\n      rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the\n\n      exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 20\n\nStrickland 466 U.S. 668 at 689,104 S.Ct. at 2064.\n\n      {¶58} In light of “the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel [and] the\n\nrange of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant,” the\n\nperformance inquiry necessarily turns on “whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable\n\nconsidering all the circumstances.” Strickland, 466 U.S. 668 at 689,104 S.Ct. at 2064.\n\nAt all points, “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.”\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. 668 at 689,104 S.Ct. at 2064.\n\n      {¶59} An appellant must further demonstrate that he suffered prejudice from his\n\ncounsel’s performance. See Strickland, 466 U. S. at 691 (“An error by counsel, even if\n\nprofessionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal\n\nproceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment”). To establish prejudice, “[t]he\n\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\n\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n\noutcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. To prevail on his ineffective-assistance claim,\n\nappellant must show, therefore, that there is a “reasonable probability” that the Trier of\n\nfact would not have found him guilty.\n\n      {¶60} None of the instances raised by Markwell rise to the level of prejudicial\n\nerror necessary to find that he was deprived of a fair trial. Having reviewed the record\n\nthat Markwell cites in support of his claim that he was denied effective assistance of\n\ncounsel, we find Markwell was not prejudiced by defense counsel’s representation of\n\nhim. The result of the trial was not unreliable nor were the proceedings fundamentally\n\nunfair because of the performance of defense counsel.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                   21\n\n\n       {¶61} Because we have found no instances of error in this case, we find\n\nMarkwell has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s performance.\n\n       {¶62} Markwell’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                V.\n\n       {¶63} Markwell contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to\n\nsuppress his interviews with the police.\n\n       {¶64} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law\n\nand fact. State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 154-155, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d\n\n71, ¶ 8. When ruling on a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of\n\nfact and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and to evaluate witness\n\ncredibility. See State v. Dunlap, 73 Ohio St.3d 308,314, 1995-Ohio-243, 652 N.E.2d\n\n988; State v. Fanning, 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 437 N.E.2d 583 (1982). Accordingly, a\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial court's factual findings if competent, credible\n\nevidence exists to support those findings. See Burnside, supra; Dunlap, supra; State v.\n\nLong, 127 Ohio App.3d 328, 332, 713 N.E.2d 1(4th Dist.1998); State v. Medcalf, 111\n\nOhio App.3d 142, 675 N.E.2d 1268 (4th Dist.1996). However, once this Court has\n\naccepted those facts as true, it must independently determine as a matter of law\n\nwhether the trial court met the applicable legal standard. See Burnside, supra, citing\n\nState v. McNamara, 124 Ohio App.3d 706, 707 N.E.2d 539(4th Dist 1997); See,\n\ngenerally, United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740(2002);\n\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911(1996). That\n\nis, the application of the law to the trial court's findings of fact is subject to a de novo\n\nstandard of review Ornelas, supra. Moreover, due weight should be given “to inferences\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                22\n\ndrawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.” Ornelas,\n\nsupra at 698, 116 S.Ct. at 1663.\n\n       {¶65} In order for an accused's statement to be admissible at trial, police must\n\nhave given the accused a Miranda warning if there was a custodial interrogation.\n\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 471, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694(1966). If that\n\ncondition is established, the court can proceed to consider whether there has been an\n\nexpress or implied waiver of Miranda rights.

Id. “Prior to any questioning, the person must\n\nbe warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be\n\nused as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney,\n\neither retained or appointed.” Id.\n\n       {¶67} In Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383\n\n(1995), the Court offered the following description of the Miranda custody test:\n\n       Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were\n\n       the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those\n\n       circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at\n\n       liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is set and\n\n       the players' lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an\n\n       objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                     23\n\n\n       restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal\n\n       arrest.\n\n516 U.S., at 112, 116 S.Ct. 457 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accord, Yarborough\n\nv. Alvarado, 541U.S. 652, 653, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938(2004).

However, the\n\ntest   involves   no   consideration   of   the   particular   suspect's   “actual   mindset.”\n\nYarborough, 541 U.S. 652, 667, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938.

Markwell appeared at the police station voluntarily in his own\n\nvehicle accompanied by his wife. There is no suggestion in the record that Markwell\n\nwas threatened if he did not appear. Detective Hill read Markwell the standard “Advice\n\nof Rights” form and explained the form to him. After Markwell told Hill that he could not\n\nread or write, Detective Hill took the time to explain Markwell’s rights to him. Markwell\n\nwas aware prior to agreeing to come to the station of the nature of the meeting.\n\nMarkwell was free to and did in fact return home after the interview.\n\n       {¶69} Other facts point in the opposite direction. Markwell testified that he was\n\nnot permitted to speak with his wife. Markwell was never told he was free to leave at\n\nany time during the interview.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                  24\n\n      {¶70} In State v. Brown, 100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d\n\n506(2003), the Ohio Supreme Court noted “[i]t is well established that at a suppression\n\nhearing, ‘the evaluation of evidence and the credibility of witnesses are issues for the\n\ntrier of fact.’ State v. Mills (1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972, citing State\n\nv. Fanning (1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583. The trial court was\n\nfree to find the officers' testimony more credible than appellant's. We therefore defer to\n\nthe trial court's ruling regarding the weight and credibility of witnesses. State v.\n\nMoore (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 31, 689 N.E.2d 1.” Brown at 55, 689 N.E.2d 1, 2003-\n\nOhio-5059 at ¶ 15, 796 N.E.2d at 512.\n\n      {¶71} We conclude that a reasonable person in Markwell's position during the\n\ninterview would have understood that he was free to walk away from the questioning by\n\nthe officer and leave. State v. Mason, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 153–154, 694 N.E.2d 932,\n\n1998-Ohio-370(1998).\n\n      {¶72} Markwell argues that because he cannot read or write and because he\n\nhad head injuries in the past he felt compelled to speak. Therefore, Markwell contends\n\nthat his statements were involuntary.\n\n      {¶73} In Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d\n\n473(1986), the court held that \"police over-reaching\" is a prerequisite to a finding of\n\ninvoluntariness. Evidence of use by the interrogators of an inherently coercive tactic\n\n(e.g., physical abuse, threats, deprivation of food, medical treatment, or sleep) will\n\ntrigger the totality of the circumstances analysis. State v. Clark, 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 261,\n\n527 N.E.2d 844, 854(1988).\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                  25\n\n       {¶74} In the cause sub judice, Markwell does not assert that he was physically\n\ndeprived or mistreated while at the police department, nor does the record reveal any\n\ntype of physical deprivation. Moreover, there is no evidence that police subjected\n\nMarkwell to threats or physical abuse, or deprived him of food, sleep, or medical\n\ntreatment. See State v. Cooey, 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 28, 544 N.E.2d 895, 908(1989).\n\n       {¶75} The record is insufficient to establish that Markwell’s “will was overborne”\n\nby the officers’ activities in coming to his home to investigate this crime and in having\n\nMarkwell come to the police station to make a statement.\n\n     {¶76}   Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in failing to\n\nsuppress appellant's oral statements.\n\n     {¶77}   Markwell’s fifth assignment of error is overruled in its entirety.\n\n                                                VI.\n\n     {¶78}   In his sixth assignment of error, Markwell claims he was denied the right to\n\na fair trial based on cumulative error. Specifically, Markwell alleges that the errors\n\noutlined in his previous assignments of error amount to cumulative error requiring\n\nreversal.\n\n     {¶79}   In State v. Brown, 100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506,\n\nthe Ohio Supreme Court recognized the doctrine of cumulative error. However, as\n\nexplained in State v. Bethel, 110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, ¶\n\n197, it is simply not enough to intone the phrase “cumulative error.” State v. Sapp, 105\n\nOhio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, ¶ 103.\n\n    {¶80}    Here, Markwell cites the doctrine of cumulative error, lists or incorporates\n\nthe previous assignments of error, and gives no analysis or explanation as to why or\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 26\n\n\nhow the errors have had a prejudicial cumulative effect. Thus, this assignment of error\n\nhas no substance under Bethel and Sapp.\n\n    {¶81}    Further, where we have found that the trial court did not err, cumulative\n\nerror is simply inapplicable. State v. Carter, 5th Dist. No. 2002CA00125, 2003-Ohio-\n\n1313 at ¶ 37. To the extent that we have found that any claimed error of the trial court\n\nwas harmless, or that claimed error did not rise to the level of plain error, we conclude\n\nthat the cumulative effect of such claimed errors is also harmless because taken\n\ntogether, they did not materially affect the verdict. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54,\n\n89-90, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, 270 at ¶ 185.\n\n    {¶82}    As this case does not involve multiple instances of error, Markwell’s sixth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 27\n\n\n                                          Conclusion\n\n    {¶83}    Markwell’s first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth assignments of error\n\nare overruled in their entirety and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas,\n\nMuskingum County, Ohio, is affirmed.\n\nBy Gwin, P.J., and\n\nWise, J., concur;\n\nHoffman, J., concurs\n\nseparately\n\n\n\n\n                                             _________________________________\n                                             HON.

The majority finds the facts clearly indicate a scheme, plan or system negating\n\nany claim of accident. I interpret this to mean it finds the evidence admissible under\n\nEvid.R. 404(B). However, the Appellant herein denied the charges, he did not claim\n\naccident. I find the evidence is not admissible under the rule. For a similar analysis see\n\nthis Court’s opinion in State v. Slaven, 2010-Ohio-6400. And we noted in Slaven, the\n\nsimilarities between the sexual abuses committed against each victim and the\n\ninflammatory nature of the offenses elevate the risk of prejudice.\n\n       {¶86} While the evidence as it pertains to each victim may have been direct, I\n\nam not convinced it was simple nor distinct.       The testimony of each victim as to\n\nAppellant’s conduct was similar in nature. The fact-finder would have had a difficult\n\ntime looking at the evidence supporting each offense as simple and distinct because the\n\ntemptation would be great to respond to the evidence emotionally rather than rationally.\n\nSee State v. Frazier, 2004-Ohio-1536, for a similar analysis.\n\n       {¶87} Despite the above, I find the overall weight of the evidence in this case\n\nsubstantial and more than sufficient to overcome any prejudice Appellant may have\n\nsuffered as a result of the joinder.\n\n\n\n                                                ________________________________\n                                                HON.

Markwell [“Markwell”]\n\nguilty of one count of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition. On September\n\n24, 2011, Markwell returned to court for sentencing. The trial court ordered that\n\nMarkwell serve a mandatory prison sentence of ten (10) years on the rape count; a\n\nprison term of eighteen (18) months on the count of gross sexual imposition; and a\n\nprison term of five (5) years on the second count of gross sexual imposition. The\n\nsentences ordered for rape and the count of gross sexual imposition involving the same\n\nvictim are to be served concurrent with one another, but consecutive to the sentence\n\nordered for the gross sexual imposition count involving a different victim, for an\n\naggregate prison term of fifteen (15) years. Markwell was also designated as a Tier Ill\n\nsexual offender.\n\n                                         Facts and Procedural History\n\n        {¶2}     On April 25, 2011, C.T. a minor reported that she had been touched by\n\nher step-grandfather, Markwell. She told officers that Markwell had touched her on\n\nseven different occasions while she visited her grandmother between June 2008 and\n\nJune 2010. C.T. reported that Markwell would come into the room where she and her\n\nsister were sleeping and push his fingers up inside her vagina. She also reported that\n\nMarkwell also attempted to do the same thing to her sister, D.T., who would sleep\n\nthrough the incident.\n\n        {¶3}     Between April 23, and April 25, 2011, C.T. engaged in a texting\n\nconversation with Markwell in which she attempted to get him to admit this conduct. In\n\none text, Markwell wrote that he loved her and that he was making love to her.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                    3\n\n\n       {¶4}   Upon investigation of these allegations, officers spoke to M. H., then eight\n\n(8) years old, who reported that approximately a year earlier, Markwell had touched her\n\non her private area.\n\n       {¶5}   Markwell was interviewed by detectives and denied the allegations. In the\n\ndefense case, Markwell testified and denied the allegations. He further testified that\n\nM.H., age 8, was sexually adventurous or promiscuous in that she would try to touch\n\nadults on their privates. He further testified about the great relationship that he had with\n\nall of his wife's grandchildren. In regards to the computer messaging, he testified that\n\nhis wife's grandchildren had access to the computer during the time in question and\n\nblamed them for fabricating the conversations testified to by C. T. He also testified that\n\nC. T. had a motive to lie about the charges because he had threatened to tell her\n\nparents about a secret boyfriend of hers.\n\n                                      Assignments of Error\n\n       {¶6}   Markwell raises six assignments of error,\n\n       {¶7}   “I.

Of relevance, Markwell asked that the jury be instructed as follows,\n\n“Sexual Conduct means insertion however slight of any part of the body into the vaginal\n\ncavity of another.” Thus, Markwell failed to request a more specific jury instruction\n\ndefining “penetration.”\n\n       {¶37} The trial court instructed the jury in relevant part, “the insertion, however\n\nslight, of any part of the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the\n\nvaginal or anal cavity of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                 13\n\n\nvaginal or anal intercourse.” Thus, the trial court gave the jury the instruction that\n\nMarkwell had requested at that time.\n\n       {¶38} On appeal, Markwell contends that the trial court was required to define\n\n“penetration” as the spreading of the vaginal lips. E.g., State v. Melendez, 9th Dist. No.\n\n08CA009477, 2009-Ohio-4425; State v. Lucas, 2nd Dist. No. 18644, 2001-Ohio-1350.\n\n       {¶39} As noted in our disposition of Markwell’s first assignment of error, under\n\nthe circumstances of the case at bar, there is nothing in the record to show that the he\n\nwas prejudiced by the failure to give the instruction that Markwell now claims the trial\n\ncourt should have given. C.T. testified and demonstrated for the jury that penetration did\n\nin fact occur,\n\n       Q. And I want to talk about the word penetration.

Yeah.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q. Did you demonstrate with your fingernail it was inside?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n1T. at 126-127. Thus, C.H. testified that Markwell’s finger penetrated her vaginal cavity.\n\nAccordingly, we find any error in the instructions to the jury was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n       {¶40} Markwell’s second assignment of error is overruled in its entirety.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       {¶41} In his third assignment of error, Markwell argues that the charges against\n\nhim should have been severed and tried in two separate proceedings one for C.T. and\n\nthe second for M.H. At the outset, we note that Markwell did not move to sever the\n\ncounts for trial; nor did appellant object to the joinder of the cases for trial. Accordingly,\n\nour review is limited to finding plain error.\n\n       {¶42} Crim.

A convicted\n\n      defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts\n\n      or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of\n\n      reasonable professional judgment. The court must then determine\n\n      whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions\n\n      were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. In\n\n      making that determination, the court should keep in mind that counsel's\n\n      function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the\n\n      adversarial testing process work in the particular case.

To prevail on his ineffective-assistance claim,\n\nappellant must show, therefore, that there is a “reasonable probability” that the Trier of\n\nfact would not have found him guilty.\n\n      {¶60} None of the instances raised by Markwell rise to the level of prejudicial\n\nerror necessary to find that he was deprived of a fair trial. Having reviewed the record\n\nthat Markwell cites in support of his claim that he was denied effective assistance of\n\ncounsel, we find Markwell was not prejudiced by defense counsel’s representation of\n\nhim. The result of the trial was not unreliable nor were the proceedings fundamentally\n\nunfair because of the performance of defense counsel.\n\fMuskingum County, Case No. CT2011-0056                                                   21\n\n\n       {¶61} Because we have found no instances of error in this case, we find\n\nMarkwell has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s performance.\n\n       {¶62} Markwell’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                                V.\n\n       {¶63} Markwell contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to\n\nsuppress his interviews with the police.\n\n       {¶64} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law\n\nand fact.

The majority finds the facts clearly indicate a scheme, plan or system negating\n\nany claim of accident. I interpret this to mean it finds the evidence admissible under\n\nEvid.R. 404(B). However, the Appellant herein denied the charges, he did not claim\n\naccident. I find the evidence is not admissible under the rule. For a similar analysis see\n\nthis Court’s opinion in State v. Slaven, 2010-Ohio-6400. And we noted in Slaven, the\n\nsimilarities between the sexual abuses committed against each victim and the\n\ninflammatory nature of the offenses elevate the risk of prejudice.\n\n       {¶86} While the evidence as it pertains to each victim may have been direct, I\n\nam not convinced it was simple nor distinct.       The testimony of each victim as to\n\nAppellant’s conduct was similar in nature. The fact-finder would have had a difficult\n\ntime looking at the evidence supporting each offense as simple and distinct because the\n\ntemptation would be great to respond to the evidence emotionally rather than rationally.\n\nSee State v. Frazier, 2004-Ohio-1536, for a similar analysis.\n\n       {¶87} Despite the above, I find the overall weight of the evidence in this case\n\nsubstantial and more than sufficient to overcome any prejudice Appellant may have\n\nsuffered as a result of the joinder.\n\n\n\n                                                ________________________________\n                                                HON.
