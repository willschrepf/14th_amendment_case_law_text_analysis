No. A-12-1058.\n\n 1.\t Modification of Decree: Visitation: Child Support: Appeal and Error. Issues\n     involving the modification of a divorce decree, parenting time, and the amount of\n     child support are initially entrusted to the discretion of the district court, whose\n     determinations in these matters are reviewed de novo on the record for an abuse\n     of discretion.\n 2.\t Child Support. The trial court’s discretion to award child support extends to its\n     determination that the child support award should be retroactive.\n 3.\t Attorney Fees: Appeal and Error. An appellate court reviews a trial court’s\n     award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.\n 4.\t Courts: Words and Phrases. An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court\n     acts or refrains from acting, and the selected option results in a decision which is\n     untenable and unfairly deprives the litigant of a substantial right or just result.\n 5.\t Modification of Decree: Child Custody. Ordinarily, custody of a minor child\n     will not be modified unless there has been a material change in circumstances\n     showing that the custodial parent is unfit or that the best interests of the child\n     require such action.\n 6.\t Modification of Decree: Words and Phrases. A material change in circum-\n     stances means the occurrence of something which, had it been known to the dis-\n     solution court at the time of the initial decree, would have persuaded the court to\n     decree differently.\n 7.\t Modification of Decree. Changes in circumstances which were within the con-\n     templation of the parties at the time of the decree are not material changes in\n     circumstances for purposes of modifying a divorce decree.\n 8.\t Modification of Decree: Child Custody: Proof. Prior to the modification of a\n     child custody order, two steps of proof must be taken by the moving party. First,\n     the moving party must show a material change in circumstances that affects the\n     best interests of the child. Second, the moving party must prove that changing the\n     child’s custody is in the child’s best interests.\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n536\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n 9.\t Appeal and Error. An appellate court will not consider an issue on appeal that\n     was not presented to or passed upon by the trial court.\n10.\t Modification of Decree: Child Support: Proof. A parent seeking to modify a\n     child support award must show a material change in circumstances, including\n     changes in the financial position of the parent obligated to pay support.\n11.\t Child Support: Rules of the Supreme Court. Generally, child support payments\n     should be set according to the guidelines established pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat.\n     § 42-364.16 (Reissue 2008).\n12.\t Child Support: Rules of the Supreme Court: Presumptions. Although the\n     child support guidelines are not to be applied with blind rigidity, child support\n     shall be established in accordance with the guidelines, unless the court finds that\n     one or both parties have produced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption\n     that the application of the guidelines will result in a fair and equitable child sup-\n     port order.\n13.\t Modification of Decree: Child Custody. If trial evidence establishes a joint\n     physical custody arrangement, courts will so construe it, regardless of how prior\n     decrees or court orders have characterized the arrangement.\n14.\t Child Custody: Child Support: Rules of the Supreme Court. Where parties\n     exercise joint physical custody, the trial court must use the joint custody work-\n     sheet of the child support guidelines to calculate support.\n15.\t Child Custody: Words and Phrases. Joint physical custody is generally\n     defined as joint responsibility for minor day-to-day decisions and the exertion\n     of continuous physical custody by both parents over a child for significant\n     time periods.\n16.\t Appeal and Error. Generally, a party cannot complain of error which the party\n     has invited the court to commit.\n17.\t Divorce: Minors: Stipulations. Parties in a proceeding to dissolve a mar-\n     riage cannot control the disposition of matters pertaining to minor children by\n     agreement.\n18.\t Divorce: Modification of Decree: Child Support. The paramount concern and\n     question in determining child support, whether in the initial marital dissolution\n     action or in the proceedings for modification of decree, is the best interests of\n     the child.\n19.\t Child Support. In determining whether to order retroactive support, a court must\n     consider the parties’ status, character, situation, and attendant circumstances. As\n     part of that consideration, the court must consider whether the obligated party has\n     the ability to pay the lump-sum amount of a retroactive award.\n20.\t Modification of Decree: Child Support: Time. Absent equities to the contrary,\n     modification of a child support order should be applied retroactively to the first\n     day of the month following the filing date of the application for modification.\n21.\t Child Support: Child Custody. In the determination of child support, the\n     children and the custodial parent should not be penalized by delay in the legal\n     process, nor should the noncustodial parent gratuitously benefit from such delay.\n22.\t Taxation: Child Support: Alimony: Child Custody. Because a tax dependency\n     exemption is an economic benefit nearly identical in nature to an award of child\n     support or alimony, a trial court may exercise its equitable powers to allocate\n     dependency exemptions between the custodial and noncustodial parent.\n\f            Decisions     of the  Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                           McDONALD v.

Although a custodial parent is pre-\n     sumptively entitled to a tax dependency exemption, a trial court may use its equi-\n     table powers to allocate the exemption to a noncustodial parent if the situation of\n     the parties so requires.\n24.\t Attorney Fees. Attorney fees are recoverable in Nebraska only when provided\n     for by law or allowed by custom.\n25.\t Attorney Fees: Child Support. Attorney fees and costs are allowed in child sup-\n     port cases brought by a child’s mother, father, guardian or next friend, the county\n     attorney, or other authorized attorney.\n26.\t Attorney Fees. The award of attorney fees depends on multiple factors that\n     include the nature of the case, the services performed and results obtained, the\n     earning capacity of the parties, the length of time required for preparation and\n     presentation of the case, customary charges of the bar, and general equities of\n     the case.\n27.\t Attorney Fees: Courts.

INTRODUCTION\n   Del McDonald appeals from the decision of the district\ncourt for Douglas County modifying his child support obliga-\ntion, awarding attorney fees to his former wife, and denying\nhis request for custody modification. We determine that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify\nchild custody, in modifying Del’s child support obligation,\nor in awarding attorney fees. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\ncourt’s decision.\n                   II. BACKGROUND\n Del and Coleen Spencer, formerly known as Coleen\nMcDonald, married in March 1999 and divorced in July 2009.\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n538\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nTwo children were born during the marriage—a son born in\n1999 and a daughter born in 2002.\n   In the original divorce decree, the court awarded Coleen\nsole legal and physical custody of the parties’ two children,\nsubject to Del’s parenting time. Del’s parenting time con-\nsisted of alternating weekends, Wednesday nights, rotating\nholidays, and extended time during the summer. Del’s parent-\ning rights also included a right of first refusal when Coleen\nworked overnight.\n   To facilitate their shared parenting responsibilities, the par-\nenting plan established rules for Del and Coleen to aid them\nin communicating. The rules eliminated face-to-face interac-\ntion during custody exchanges, established that the parties\nwould communicate professionally through e-mail or voice-\nmail, and ordered the parties to sit apart from each other at\nschool activities.\n   In addition to sole custody, the decree also awarded Coleen\n$69 per month in child support. The decree ordered Coleen to\nmaintain health and medical insurance for the children unless it\nwas available to Del at a lower rate. Del’s child support obliga-\ntions were calculated based on his status as a full-time student\nwith minimal income.\n   About a year after the decree was entered, Del obtained\nfull-time employment as a respiratory therapist at a Bellevue\nmedical center and occasionally worked additional shifts at a\nhospital in Blair. Because Del’s income increased, the State\nof Nebraska intervened in February 2011 to ask the court\nto recalculate Del’s child support obligation. Del filed an\nanswer and counterclaim alleging that there had been a mate-\nrial change in circumstances which warranted an award of\nfull custody to him. He based his modification request upon\ncontact that the children had with Coleen’s then boyfriend,\nwho Del claimed had a history of domestic abuse and who\ntransported the children while he was consuming alcohol. He\nfurther claimed that Coleen was frustrating his relationship\nwith the children by refusing telephone contact and denying\nhim the right of first refusal to care for the children when\nColeen was at work.\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v. McDONALD\t539\n\t                     Cite as 21 Neb. App. 535\n\n   At trial, the parties addressed both child support and custody\nissues. To help determine the proper amount of child support,\nboth parties submitted proposed calculations to the court. The\nState calculated Del’s income as $24 per hour full time and\nColeen’s income as $23.67 per hour full time. Both parties\nstipulated to the exhibits containing the income calculations.\nBoth parties showed they were providing the children with\nhealth insurance. The evidence showed that Del’s health insur-\nance premium is slightly lower, but Coleen testified that her\ninsurance does not require her to make any copayments. The\nparties submitted exhibits as evidence of their income, and\nthey stipulated to all of the exhibits. The stipulated exhibits\nincluded the parties’ proposed child support calculations (all of\nwhich used the same income for the parties), tax returns, and\npay stubs.\n   With respect to custody, at trial, Del requested the court\nto award him joint custody of the children on an alternating\nweekly basis, despite the request in his counterclaim that he be\nawarded “full custody.” Under his proposed custody plan, the\nchildren would stay in their current school and he would move\ncloser to their current residence. In support of his request, Del\nstated that he is involved in the children’s lives: he attends\nschool activities and exercises his parenting time. Del argued\nthat a joint custody plan was warranted by material changes in\ncircumstances. Specifically, he argued that circumstances have\nchanged, because his work schedule has allowed him more\ntime to parent, Coleen has prevented him from exercising the\nright of first refusal the way the parties envisioned at the time\nof the original decree, Coleen’s new husband has driven the\nchildren while having open containers of alcohol in his car,\nand Coleen has informed the children that Del does not pay\nchild support.\n   Del and Coleen’s son testified that he did not want the cus-\ntody schedule to change. Their daughter did not testify. Both\nparties admitted that they did not have a cordial relationship.\n   The trial court addressed the issues of custody, child sup-\nport, health insurance, tax dependency exemptions, and attor-\nney fees. The trial court determined that although no material\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n540\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nchange supported a change in custody, Del’s new employment\nstatus was a material change that supported increasing child\nsupport. The trial court increased Del’s child support from $69\nper month to $982 per month. It awarded the support retroac-\ntively from March 2011, resulting in $14,608 in past support.\nAlthough Del’s income increased in June 2010, the State did\nnot move to modify child support until February 2011; accord-\ningly, the trial court could not award retroactive support until\nMarch 2011.\n   While increasing Del’s support, the court determined that\nColeen should continue to provide health insurance for the\nchildren. Although Coleen’s premium was slightly more expen-\nsive than Del’s, the court determined her plan was more eco-\nnomical because it did not require any copayments. Finally, the\ncourt determined that each parent could claim one child for tax\nexemption purposes but required Del to fulfill his child support\nobligation in order to claim the exemption.\n   The trial court also found that Del should have been pay-\ning an increased amount of child support since June 2010 and\nthat Coleen incurred legal costs to prove this increase. The\ncourt noted that although the attorney fee statements did not\ndistinguish how much of the fee was attributable to the claim\nfor increased child support, a significant portion of the bill was\ndevoted to that issue. Accordingly, the trial court required Del\nto pay Coleen $2,000 of her $5,046.50 legal bill.\n   Del timely appealed.\n\n                 III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Del argues on appeal, condensed, renumbered, and restated,\nthat the trial court erred in (1) failing to modify Coleen’s award\nof sole legal and physical custody, (2) modifying and calculat-\ning child support, (3) ordering support to be retroactive, (4)\nmaking the tax dependency exemption based on being current\non support, and (5) awarding attorney fees.\n\n                  IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1-3] Generally, issues involving the modification of a\ndivorce decree, parenting time, and the amount of child sup-\nport are initially entrusted to the discretion of the district court,\n\f         Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                     McDONALD v. McDONALD\t541\n\t                      Cite as 21 Neb. App. 535\n\nwhose determinations in these matters are reviewed de novo\non the record for an abuse of discretion. See Boamah-Wiafe v.\nRashleigh, 9 Neb. App. 503, 614 N.W.2d 778 (2000). See, also,\nMetcalf v. Metcalf, 278 Neb. 258, 769 N.W.2d 386 (2009).\nThe trial court’s discretion to award child support extends to\nits determination that the child support award should be retro-\nactive. See Emery v. Moffett, 269 Neb. 867, 697 N.W.2d 249\n(2005). An appellate court also reviews a trial court’s award of\nattorney fees for an abuse of discretion. See Boamah-Wiafe v.\nRashleigh, supra.\n   [4] An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court acts or\nrefrains from acting, and the selected option results in a deci-\nsion which is untenable and unfairly deprives the litigant of a\nsubstantial right or just result. See Coffey v. Coffey, 11 Neb.\nApp. 788, 661 N.W.2d 327 (2003).\n                          V. ANALYSIS\n                    1. Custody Modification\n   Del argues that the trial court abused its discretion in failing\nto modify the custody decree. In particular, Del argues that the\ntrial court should have awarded him joint custody, increased\nparenting time, or the right of first refusal whenever Coleen is\nat work. We disagree.\n   [5-7] Ordinarily, custody of a minor child will not be modi-\nfied unless there has been a material change in circumstances\nshowing that the custodial parent is unfit or that the best\ninterests of the child require such action. Adams v. Adams, 13\nNeb. App. 276, 691 N.W.2d 541 (2005). A material change\nin circumstances means the occurrence of something which,\nhad it been known to the dissolution court at the time of the\ninitial decree, would have persuaded the court to decree dif-\nferently. Id. Changes in circumstances which were within the\ncontemplation of the parties at the time of the decree are not\nmaterial changes in circumstances for purposes of modifying\na divorce decree. See Desjardins v. Desjardins, 239 Neb. 878,\n479 N.W.2d 451 (1992).\n   [8] Prior to modification, two steps of proof must be taken\nby the moving party. First, the moving party must show a\nmaterial change in circumstances that affects the best interests\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n542\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nof the child. Second, the moving party must prove that chang-\ning the child’s custody is in the child’s best interests. See\nAdams v. Adams, supra.\n    In his counterclaim, Del claimed that Coleen has attempted\nto damage the children’s relationship with him, frustrated his\nability to have contact with them, and prevented him from\nexercising the right of first refusal contemplated in the ini-\ntial decree, and that contact with Coleen’s new husband has\nharmed the children. Del argued that these changes constitute a\nmaterial change in circumstances.\n    At trial, Del testified that Coleen’s husband had driven the\nchildren while having open containers of alcohol in his car\nand that Coleen had encroached on Del’s parenting time by\nscheduling the children’s activities during that time and did\nnot allow him to make up all of the missed time. He also tes-\ntified that his regular job allows him to have more time with\nhis children.\n    The trial court determined that there was not a material\nchange in circumstances. On a de novo review of the record,\nwe agree. Although Del presented numerous allegations in\nhis counterclaim, his argument is more limited on appeal. In\nhis brief, Del claims that a material change in circumstances\nexists, because Coleen has “abuse[d her] power” and shut him\nout of the children’s lives, Del has a flexible schedule and\ntime to parent, and Del has not been able to exercise as much\nparenting time as the original decree contemplated. Brief for\nappellant at 24.\n    We address the arguments Del presented on appeal in turn.\n    Del argues that Coleen has marginalized his ability to par-\nent by failing to communicate with him and that this failure\nto communicate places an “inordinate amount of control” in\nher hands. Id. Although we recognize that the parties’ strained\nrelationship necessarily makes parenting difficult, there is no\nevidence that their relationship has deteriorated from the time\nof the original divorce decree. The fact that Del and Coleen\ncannot get along with each other is not a new development;\nthe original divorce decree recognized this when it ordered\ne-mail communication and segregated seating at the children’s\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v. McDONALD\t543\n\t                     Cite as 21 Neb. App. 535\n\nactivities. Del did not present persuasive evidence of a material\nchange in the parties’ relationship.\n   Similarly, Del did not present persuasive evidence that his\nnew work schedule was a development not contemplated at the\ntime of the divorce decree. At the time of the divorce decree,\nDel was a full-time student. The evidence shows that at the\ntime of the divorce, Del was enrolled in a 2-year respiratory\ntherapist program. Given the limited nature of the program, the\nparties certainly contemplated Del’s completion of the program\nat the time of the divorce. Del’s graduation from the program\nand acceptance of employment constitute a development that\nwas certainly expected at the time of the divorce. See McElyea\nv. McElyea, No. A-09-716, 2010 WL 4237938 (Neb. App. Jan.\n5, 2010) (selected for posting to court Web site).\n   Even if the parties had not contemplated the current situa­\ntion, however, the evidence does not show that Del is cur-\nrently more available to parent. The record does not reveal\nDel’s schooling schedule at the time of the divorce decree. Del\ntestified, however, that he should not have been required to\nreimburse Coleen for daycare during that time period, because\nhe could have watched the children every day. Given Del’s\ntestimony and the lack of evidence regarding his schedule at\nthe time of the decree, there is no basis to compare his parent-\ning availability. Accordingly, the record presented to this court\ndoes not demonstrate a material change in circumstances based\non the changes in Del’s schedule.\n   Finally, Coleen’s changed work schedule does not consti-\ntute a material change in circumstances. The original divorce\ndecree awards Del a right of first refusal while Coleen worked\nthe night shift. The parties did not provide evidence as to why\nthey limited Del’s right to time periods when Coleen worked\nat night as opposed to simply providing Del a right of first\nrefusal when Coleen worked. While Coleen’s change in work\nschedule may have prevented Del from exercising the right of\nfirst refusal, Del did not prove that the intention of the right\nwas simply to provide him with increased parenting time and\ntherefore did not show that Coleen’s change has frustrated the\nintention of the provision in the decree. Accordingly, we do not\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n544\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nfind a material change in circumstances based upon Coleen’s\nchanged schedule.\n   The evidence reveals that both parents are capable of pro-\nviding their children with a stable home environment. They\nboth love their children and support them academically, finan-\ncially, and emotionally. There was no evidence that Coleen\nwas unfit or that the children were not thriving in her care.\nTherefore, upon our de novo review of the record, we agree\nthat there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a mate-\nrial change in circumstances has occurred. Absent a material\nchange in circumstances, Del is not entitled to a modification\nof custody.\n   [9] On appeal, Del argues that the trial court should have\nawarded him additional parenting time. Aside from requesting\njoint custody, however, Del did not request additional parenting\ntime in his counterclaim or at trial. An appellate court will not\nconsider an issue on appeal that was not presented to or passed\nupon by the trial court. Scurlocke v. Hansen, 268 Neb. 548, 684\nN.W.2d 565 (2004). Because the issue was not presented to the\ntrial court, we do not consider it on appeal.\n\n                2. Child Support Modification\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in modifying child\nsupport and in its child support calculation. Del argues that\nthe support was incorrectly calculated, because the trial court\nused the wrong worksheet and income level, improperly gave\nColeen credit for providing health insurance, and should have\nawarded a deviation. We disagree.\n\n                       (a) Modification\n   [10] A parent seeking to modify a child support award must\nshow a material change in circumstances, including changes in\nthe financial position of the parent obligated to pay support.\nSee Sabatka v. Sabatka, 245 Neb. 109, 511 N.W.2d 107 (1994).\nDel’s financial position changed drastically from the time\nof the divorce decree. At the time of the decree, Del was an\nunemployed student with minimal income. At the time of the\nrequest for modification, he worked full time as a respiratory\ntherapist and earned a stable salary. The trial court did not err\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v. McDONALD\t545\n\t                     Cite as 21 Neb. App. 535\n\nin finding a material change supported modifying Del’s child\nsupport award.\n                   (b) Sole Custody Worksheet\n                          and Deviation\n   Del argues that the trial court abused its discretion in using\nthe sole custody worksheet, because the parties are effectively\nexercising joint custody. Del notes that he has custody of the\nchildren 163 to 166 days per year, or 44 to 45 percent of the\ntime. Alternatively, Del argues that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in failing to deviate from the award produced using\nthe joint custody worksheet because of Del’s substantial par-\nenting time.\n   [11,12] Generally, child support payments should be set\naccording to the guidelines established pursuant to Neb. Rev.\nStat. § 42-364.16 (Reissue 2008). Hajenga v. Hajenga, 257\nNeb. 841, 601 N.W.2d 528 (1999). Although the guidelines\nare not to be applied with blind rigidity, child support shall\nbe established in accordance with the guidelines, unless the\ncourt finds that one or both parties have produced sufficient\nevidence to rebut the presumption that the application of the\nguidelines will result in a fair and equitable child support\norder. § 42-364.16; Pool v. Pool, 9 Neb. App. 453, 613 N.W.2d\n819 (2000).\n   [13,14] Neb. Ct. R. § 4-212 (rev. 2011) establishes a pre-\nsumption of joint support when the trial court orders joint\ncustody and each party’s parenting time exceeds 142 days\nper year. If trial evidence establishes a joint physical custody\narrangement, courts will so construe it, regardless of how prior\ndecrees or court orders have characterized the arrangement.\nElsome v. Elsome, 257 Neb. 889, 601 N.W.2d 537 (1999).\nWhere parties exercise joint physical custody, the trial court\nmust use the joint custody worksheet to calculate support. See\nPool v. Pool, supra.\n   [15] Joint physical custody is generally defined as “joint\nresponsibility for minor day-to-day decisions and the exer-\ntion of continuous physical custody by both parents over a\nchild for significant time periods.” Id. at 457, 613 N.W.2d\nat 823. In Hill v. Hill, 20 Neb. App. 528, 827 N.W.2d 304\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n546\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\n(2013), we examined the line of Nebraska cases defining\njoint physical custody. (These cases are: Elsome v. Elsome,\nsupra; Pool v. Pool, supra; Heesacker v. Heesacker, 262 Neb.\n179, 629 N.W.2d 558 (2001); and Drew on behalf of Reed v.\nReed, 16 Neb. App. 905, 755 N.W.2d 420 (2008).) In Hill, we\nnoted that Nebraska cases distinguish between a continuous\nalternating custody schedule and a more “‘typical’” week-\nend, holiday, and summer visitation schedule. 20 Neb. App.\nat 535, 827 N.W.2d at 311. We explained that “the amount\nof time the children spend with each parent is less important\nthan how the time is allocated when determining whether joint\nphysical custody exists.” Id. Part of the reason for this distinc-\ntion is that the way parenting time is allocated relates to the\nexpenses associated with that responsibility. See Heesacker v.\nHeesacker, supra. In Heesacker, for example, the court deter-\nmined that a father’s typical visitation schedule did not give\nrise to the same expenses as the mother’s day-to-day schedule\neven though the father parented the children 35 percent of\nthe time.\n   Del has custody of the children 163 to 166 days per year,\nwhich raises the presumption that he exercises joint custody\nwith Coleen. His custody schedule, however, consists of alter-\nnating weekends, one weekday night, alternating holidays,\nand an extended time period in the summer. He did not testify\nthat this schedule caused him to expend more money than any\nother noncustodial parent. His parenting time constitutes a\ntypical visitation schedule. See Pool v. Pool, supra. Because\nhis allocation of parenting time constitutes a typical visitation\nschedule, Coleen rebutted the presumption of joint custody.\nAccordingly, there was no reason for the trial court to use the\njoint support worksheet or to deviate from the child support\nguidelines based on the visitation schedule. The trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion by failing to do so.\n                   (c) Income Calculation\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in using an inflated\nincome figure in calculating his child support obligation. Del\nargues that the evidence shows Del’s monthly income as\n$3,692.52 and Coleen’s as $3,744, both of which are lower\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v. McDONALD\t547\n\t                     Cite as 21 Neb. App. 535\n\nthan the income amounts used by the trial court to calculate\nsupport. While we agree with Del’s analysis of what the record\nreflects, we are mindful of the fact that the worksheets Del\noffered at trial contained the same gross income amounts con-\ntained in the State’s proffered worksheets and used by the court\nin its calculations. Del claims the court erred in utilizing the\nvery amounts that he suggested the court use.\n   [16-18] Generally, a party cannot complain of error which the\nparty has invited the court to commit. Kalkowski v. Kalkowski,\n258 Neb. 1035, 607 N.W.2d 517 (2000). However, parties in\na proceeding to dissolve a marriage cannot control the dispo-\nsition of matters pertaining to minor children by agreement.\nLawson v. Pass, 10 Neb. App. 510, 633 N.W.2d 129 (2001).\nThe paramount concern and question in determining child sup-\nport, whether in the initial marital dissolution action or in the\nproceedings for modification of decree, is the best interests of\nthe child. Gangwish v. Gangwish, 267 Neb. 901, 678 N.W.2d\n503 (2004).\n   Since Del utilized these same amounts on the worksheets\nhe offered as evidence, and the use of these amounts does\nnot detrimentally affect the children, we cannot say the court\nabused its discretion in relying upon these amounts to calculate\nchild support.\n                     (d) Health Insurance\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in failing to give him\ncredit for providing the children health insurance and in giv-\ning Coleen credit for providing health insurance. The divorce\ndecree ordered Coleen to provide the children health insur-\nance unless Del could do so more economically. Coleen began\nproviding the children with health insurance. Later, Del had\nthe option to provide the children with health insurance that\nhad a slightly lower premium rate and did so. Coleen main-\ntained health insurance for the children, however, because her\nplan did not require the parties to make any copayments for\nhealth care.\n   The trial court determined that Coleen’s insurance was\nmore economical and ordered her to continue providing it to\nthe children. Consequently, Del is not required to provide the\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n548\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nchildren with health insurance. Because Coleen was ordered\nto provide the children health insurance and Del was not, the\ntrial court did not err in giving Coleen credit for providing the\ninsurance and in failing to give credit to Del.\n                    3. Awarding R etroactive\n                             Support\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in requiring him to pay\nretroactive child support, because he has been involved in rais-\ning the children, is beginning a new career, and cannot afford\nto pay such a large arrearage. We disagree.\n   [19-21] In determining whether to order retroactive support,\na court must consider the parties’ status, character, situation,\nand attendant circumstances. See Cooper v. Cooper, 8 Neb.\nApp. 532, 598 N.W.2d 474 (1999). As part of that consider-\nation, the court must consider whether the obligated party has\nthe ability to pay the lump-sum amount of a retroactive award.\nSee Wilkins v. Wilkins, 269 Neb. 937, 697 N.W.2d 280 (2005).\nAbsent equities to the contrary, modification of a child support\norder should be applied retroactively to the first day of the\nmonth following the filing date of the application for modifica-\ntion. Emery v. Moffett, 269 Neb. 867, 697 N.W.2d 249 (2005).\nThe children and the custodial parent should not be penalized\nby delay in the legal process, nor should the noncustodial par-\nent gratuitously benefit from such delay. Pursley v. Pursley,\n261 Neb. 478, 623 N.W.2d 651 (2001).\n   In this case, Del became employed in June 2010 and began\nearning a substantial salary. During this time, he was paying\nonly $69 a month in child support. Despite his increased salary,\nhe continued to pay only $69 in support without interference\nuntil February 2011, when the State petitioned the court to\nincrease his child support obligation. The trial court awarded\nchild support retroactively from March 2011, the first month\nafter the filing of the modification application. This retroac-\ntive award keeps with the principle that a noncustodial parent\nshould not gratuitously benefit from delays in the legal sys-\ntem when he or she should, and is able to, pay an increased\namount of child support. Del did not explain why it would\nbe ­inequitable for him to pay retroactive support, nor did\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v. McDONALD\t549\n\t                     Cite as 21 Neb. App. 535\n\nhe explain why paying the lump sum would be a hardship.\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in ordering the child\nsupport be awarded retroactively.\n\n                        4. Tax Exemption\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in making his tax depen-\ndency exemption dependent on his being current in paying\nchild support. We disagree.\n   [22,23] The federal government allows taxpayers to\nexclude from their income an exemption amount for each\nindividual who is a dependent of the taxpayer in the tax-\nable year. I.R.C. § 151(c) (2006). Because a tax dependency\nexemption is an economic benefit nearly identical in nature\nto an award of child support or alimony, a trial court may\nexercise its equitable powers to allocate dependency exemp-\ntions between the custodial and noncustodial parent. See\nProchaska v. Proschaka, 6 Neb. App. 302, 573 N.W.2d 777\n(1998). Although a custodial parent is presumptively entitled\nto a tax dependency exemption, a trial court may use its\nequitable powers to allocate the exemption to a noncustodial\nparent if the situation of the parties so requires. See, I.R.C.\n§ 152(c)(4)(B)(i) (2006); State on behalf of Pathammavong\nv. Pathammavong, 268 Neb. 1, 679 N.W.2d 749 (2004). If\nthe situation of the parties does not require allocating a tax\ndependency exemption to the noncustodial parent, however,\na trial court is not required to allocate it. For example, in\nState ex rel. Wells v. Wells, No. A-10-1161, 2011 WL 3689142\n(Neb. App. Aug. 23, 2011) (selected for posting to court Web\nsite), we found that the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding a father a tax dependency exemption when he was\npaying a relatively low amount of child support.\n   The federal government grants a dependency exemption to\na parent who provides support to a dependent minor. If Del\nis not current on his child support, then he is not supporting\nthe minor in the way the court deemed necessary. Given the\npurpose of the tax dependency exemption and the trial court’s\ndiscretion in awarding child support and tax exemptions, we\ncannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n550\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nto order that Del be current in paying child support in order to\nclaim a tax dependency exemption.\n                        5. Attorney Fees\n   Del argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding Coleen attorney fees, because the parties have\nsimilar incomes and Coleen refused to cooperate with Del.\nWe disagree.\n   [24-27] Attorney fees are recoverable in Nebraska only\nwhen provided for by law or allowed by custom. Cross v.\nPerreten, 257 Neb. 776, 600 N.W.2d 780 (1999). Attorney\nfees and costs are allowed in child support cases brought by a\nchild’s mother, father, guardian or next friend, the county attor-\nney, or other authorized attorney. See id. The award of attorney\nfees depends on multiple factors that include the nature of the\ncase, the services performed and results obtained, the earning\ncapacity of the parties, the length of time required for prepa-\nration and presentation of the case, customary charges of the\nbar, and general equities of the case. Sitz v. Sitz, 275 Neb. 832,\n749 N.W.2d 470 (2008). Trial courts and appellate courts are\nequally regarded as experts at determining the value of legal\nservices. See In re Interest of Antone C. et al., 12 Neb. App.\n152, 669 N.W.2d 69 (2003). Because the trial court is in a bet-\nter position to evaluate the award of attorney fees, however, an\nappellate court interferes only when the award is excessive or\ninsufficient. See id. Our de novo review of the record did not\nreveal an abuse of discretion in ordering Del to pay $2,000 in\nattorney fees.\n                     VI. CONCLUSION\n   We determine that the trial court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion in failing to modify custody, in its determination\nthat Del’s child support obligation should be modified, or\nin awarding attorney fees. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\ncourt’s decision.\n                                                Affirmed.\n\f",

An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court\n     acts or refrains from acting, and the selected option results in a decision which is\n     untenable and unfairly deprives the litigant of a substantial right or just result.\n 5.\t Modification of Decree: Child Custody. Ordinarily, custody of a minor child\n     will not be modified unless there has been a material change in circumstances\n     showing that the custodial parent is unfit or that the best interests of the child\n     require such action.\n 6.\t Modification of Decree: Words and Phrases. A material change in circum-\n     stances means the occurrence of something which, had it been known to the dis-\n     solution court at the time of the initial decree, would have persuaded the court to\n     decree differently.\n 7.\t Modification of Decree. Changes in circumstances which were within the con-\n     templation of the parties at the time of the decree are not material changes in\n     circumstances for purposes of modifying a divorce decree.\n 8.\t Modification of Decree: Child Custody: Proof. Prior to the modification of a\n     child custody order, two steps of proof must be taken by the moving party. First,\n     the moving party must show a material change in circumstances that affects the\n     best interests of the child. Second, the moving party must prove that changing the\n     child’s custody is in the child’s best interests.\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n536\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n 9.\t Appeal and Error. An appellate court will not consider an issue on appeal that\n     was not presented to or passed upon by the trial court.\n10.\t Modification of Decree: Child Support: Proof.

In determining whether to order retroactive support, a court must\n     consider the parties’ status, character, situation, and attendant circumstances.

INTRODUCTION\n   Del McDonald appeals from the decision of the district\ncourt for Douglas County modifying his child support obliga-\ntion, awarding attorney fees to his former wife, and denying\nhis request for custody modification. We determine that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify\nchild custody, in modifying Del’s child support obligation,\nor in awarding attorney fees. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\ncourt’s decision.\n                   II. BACKGROUND\n Del and Coleen Spencer, formerly known as Coleen\nMcDonald, married in March 1999 and divorced in July 2009.\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n538\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nTwo children were born during the marriage—a son born in\n1999 and a daughter born in 2002.\n   In the original divorce decree, the court awarded Coleen\nsole legal and physical custody of the parties’ two children,\nsubject to Del’s parenting time. Del’s parenting time con-\nsisted of alternating weekends, Wednesday nights, rotating\nholidays, and extended time during the summer. Del’s parent-\ning rights also included a right of first refusal when Coleen\nworked overnight.\n   To facilitate their shared parenting responsibilities, the par-\nenting plan established rules for Del and Coleen to aid them\nin communicating. The rules eliminated face-to-face interac-\ntion during custody exchanges, established that the parties\nwould communicate professionally through e-mail or voice-\nmail, and ordered the parties to sit apart from each other at\nschool activities.\n   In addition to sole custody, the decree also awarded Coleen\n$69 per month in child support. The decree ordered Coleen to\nmaintain health and medical insurance for the children unless it\nwas available to Del at a lower rate. Del’s child support obliga-\ntions were calculated based on his status as a full-time student\nwith minimal income.\n   About a year after the decree was entered, Del obtained\nfull-time employment as a respiratory therapist at a Bellevue\nmedical center and occasionally worked additional shifts at a\nhospital in Blair. Because Del’s income increased, the State\nof Nebraska intervened in February 2011 to ask the court\nto recalculate Del’s child support obligation. Del filed an\nanswer and counterclaim alleging that there had been a mate-\nrial change in circumstances which warranted an award of\nfull custody to him. He based his modification request upon\ncontact that the children had with Coleen’s then boyfriend,\nwho Del claimed had a history of domestic abuse and who\ntransported the children while he was consuming alcohol. He\nfurther claimed that Coleen was frustrating his relationship\nwith the children by refusing telephone contact and denying\nhim the right of first refusal to care for the children when\nColeen was at work.\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v. McDONALD\t539\n\t                     Cite as </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb. Ct. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n   At trial, the parties addressed both child support and custody\nissues. To help determine the proper amount of child support,\nboth parties submitted proposed calculations to the court. The\nState calculated Del’s income as $24 per hour full time and\nColeen’s income as $23.67 per hour full time. Both parties\nstipulated to the exhibits containing the income calculations.\nBoth parties showed they were providing the children with\nhealth insurance. The evidence showed that Del’s health insur-\nance premium is slightly lower, but Coleen testified that her\ninsurance does not require her to make any copayments. The\nparties submitted exhibits as evidence of their income, and\nthey stipulated to all of the exhibits. The stipulated exhibits\nincluded the parties’ proposed child support calculations (all of\nwhich used the same income for the parties), tax returns, and\npay stubs.\n   With respect to custody, at trial, Del requested the court\nto award him joint custody of the children on an alternating\nweekly basis, despite the request in his counterclaim that he be\nawarded “full custody.” Under his proposed custody plan, the\nchildren would stay in their current school and he would move\ncloser to their current residence. In support of his request, Del\nstated that he is involved in the children’s lives: he attends\nschool activities and exercises his parenting time. Del argued\nthat a joint custody plan was warranted by material changes in\ncircumstances. Specifically, he argued that circumstances have\nchanged, because his work schedule has allowed him more\ntime to parent, Coleen has prevented him from exercising the\nright of first refusal the way the parties envisioned at the time\nof the original decree, Coleen’s new husband has driven the\nchildren while having open containers of alcohol in his car,\nand Coleen has informed the children that Del does not pay\nchild support.\n   Del and Coleen’s son testified that he did not want the cus-\ntody schedule to change. Their daughter did not testify. Both\nparties admitted that they did not have a cordial relationship.\n   The trial court addressed the issues of custody, child sup-\nport, health insurance, tax dependency exemptions, and attor-\nney fees. The trial court determined that although no material\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n540\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nchange supported a change in custody, Del’s new employment\nstatus was a material change that supported increasing child\nsupport. The trial court increased Del’s child support from $69\nper month to $982 per month. It awarded the support retroac-\ntively from March 2011, resulting in $14,608 in past support.\nAlthough Del’s income increased in June 2010, the State did\nnot move to modify child support until February 2011; accord-\ningly, the trial court could not award retroactive support until\nMarch 2011.\n   While increasing Del’s support, the court determined that\nColeen should continue to provide health insurance for the\nchildren. Although Coleen’s premium was slightly more expen-\nsive than Del’s, the court determined her plan was more eco-\nnomical because it did not require any copayments. Finally, the\ncourt determined that each parent could claim one child for tax\nexemption purposes but required Del to fulfill his child support\nobligation in order to claim the exemption.\n   The trial court also found that Del should have been pay-\ning an increased amount of child support since June 2010 and\nthat Coleen incurred legal costs to prove this increase. The\ncourt noted that although the attorney fee statements did not\ndistinguish how much of the fee was attributable to the claim\nfor increased child support, a significant portion of the bill was\ndevoted to that issue. Accordingly, the trial court required Del\nto pay Coleen $2,000 of her $5,046.50 legal bill.\n   Del timely appealed.\n\n                 III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Del argues on appeal, condensed, renumbered, and restated,\nthat the trial court erred in (1) failing to modify Coleen’s award\nof sole legal and physical custody, (2) modifying and calculat-\ning child support, (3) ordering support to be retroactive, (4)\nmaking the tax dependency exemption based on being current\non support, and (5) awarding attorney fees.\n\n                  IV.

Second, the moving party must prove that chang-\ning the child’s custody is in the child’s best interests. See\nAdams v. Adams, supra.\n    In his counterclaim, Del claimed that Coleen has attempted\nto damage the children’s relationship with him, frustrated his\nability to have contact with them, and prevented him from\nexercising the right of first refusal contemplated in the ini-\ntial decree, and that contact with Coleen’s new husband has\nharmed the children. Del argued that these changes constitute a\nmaterial change in circumstances.\n    At trial, Del testified that Coleen’s husband had driven the\nchildren while having open containers of alcohol in his car\nand that Coleen had encroached on Del’s parenting time by\nscheduling the children’s activities during that time and did\nnot allow him to make up all of the missed time. He also tes-\ntified that his regular job allows him to have more time with\nhis children.\n    The trial court determined that there was not a material\nchange in circumstances. On a de novo review of the record,\nwe agree. Although Del presented numerous allegations in\nhis counterclaim, his argument is more limited on appeal. In\nhis brief, Del claims that a material change in circumstances\nexists, because Coleen has “abuse[d her] power” and shut him\nout of the children’s lives, Del has a flexible schedule and\ntime to parent, and Del has not been able to exercise as much\nparenting time as the original decree contemplated.

Id. Although we recognize that the parties’ strained\nrelationship necessarily makes parenting difficult, there is no\nevidence that their relationship has deteriorated from the time\nof the original divorce decree.

Del did not present persuasive evidence of a material\nchange in the parties’ relationship.\n   Similarly, Del did not present persuasive evidence that his\nnew work schedule was a development not contemplated at the\ntime of the divorce decree. At the time of the divorce decree,\nDel was a full-time student. The evidence shows that at the\ntime of the divorce, Del was enrolled in a 2-year respiratory\ntherapist program. Given the limited nature of the program, the\nparties certainly contemplated Del’s completion of the program\nat the time of the divorce. Del’s graduation from the program\nand acceptance of employment constitute a development that\nwas certainly expected at the time of the divorce. See McElyea\nv.

App. Jan.\n5, 2010) (selected for posting to court Web site).\n   Even if the parties had not contemplated the current situa­\ntion, however, the evidence does not show that Del is cur-\nrently more available to parent. The record does not reveal\nDel’s schooling schedule at the time of the divorce decree. Del\ntestified, however, that he should not have been required to\nreimburse Coleen for daycare during that time period, because\nhe could have watched the children every day. Given Del’s\ntestimony and the lack of evidence regarding his schedule at\nthe time of the decree, there is no basis to compare his parent-\ning availability. Accordingly, the record presented to this court\ndoes not demonstrate a material change in circumstances based\non the changes in Del’s schedule.\n   Finally, Coleen’s changed work schedule does not consti-\ntute a material change in circumstances. The original divorce\ndecree awards Del a right of first refusal while Coleen worked\nthe night shift. The parties did not provide evidence as to why\nthey limited Del’s right to time periods when Coleen worked\nat night as opposed to simply providing Del a right of first\nrefusal when Coleen worked. While Coleen’s change in work\nschedule may have prevented Del from exercising the right of\nfirst refusal, Del did not prove that the intention of the right\nwas simply to provide him with increased parenting time and\ntherefore did not show that Coleen’s change has frustrated the\nintention of the provision in the decree. Accordingly, we do not\n\f   Decisions of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n544\t21 NEBRASKA APPELLATE REPORTS\n\n\n\nfind a material change in circumstances based upon Coleen’s\nchanged schedule.\n   The evidence reveals that both parents are capable of pro-\nviding their children with a stable home environment. They\nboth love their children and support them academically, finan-\ncially, and emotionally. There was no evidence that Coleen\nwas unfit or that the children were not thriving in her care.\nTherefore, upon our de novo review of the record, we agree\nthat there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a mate-\nrial change in circumstances has occurred. Absent a material\nchange in circumstances, Del is not entitled to a modification\nof custody.\n   [9] On appeal, Del argues that the trial court should have\nawarded him additional parenting time. Aside from requesting\njoint custody, however, Del did not request additional parenting\ntime in his counterclaim or at trial.

App.\nat 535, 827 N.W.2d at 311. We explained that “the amount\nof time the children spend with each parent is less important\nthan how the time is allocated when determining whether joint\nphysical custody exists.” Id. Part of the reason for this distinc-\ntion is that the way parenting time is allocated relates to the\nexpenses associated with that responsibility. See Heesacker v.\nHeesacker, supra. In Heesacker, for example, the court deter-\nmined that a father’s typical visitation schedule did not give\nrise to the same expenses as the mother’s day-to-day schedule\neven though the father parented the children 35 percent of\nthe time.\n   Del has custody of the children 163 to 166 days per year,\nwhich raises the presumption that he exercises joint custody\nwith Coleen. His custody schedule, however, consists of alter-\nnating weekends, one weekday night, alternating holidays,\nand an extended time period in the summer. He did not testify\nthat this schedule caused him to expend more money than any\nother noncustodial parent. His parenting time constitutes a\ntypical visitation schedule. See Pool v. Pool, supra. Because\nhis allocation of parenting time constitutes a typical visitation\nschedule, Coleen rebutted the presumption of joint custody.\nAccordingly, there was no reason for the trial court to use the\njoint support worksheet or to deviate from the child support\nguidelines based on the visitation schedule. The trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion by failing to do so.\n                   (c) Income Calculation\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in using an inflated\nincome figure in calculating his child support obligation. Del\nargues that the evidence shows Del’s monthly income as\n$3,692.52 and Coleen’s as $3,744, both of which are lower\n\f        Decisions   of the Nebraska Court of Appeals\n\t                    McDONALD v.

Because Coleen was ordered\nto provide the children health insurance and Del was not, the\ntrial court did not err in giving Coleen credit for providing the\ninsurance and in failing to give credit to Del.\n                    3. Awarding R etroactive\n                             Support\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in requiring him to pay\nretroactive child support, because he has been involved in rais-\ning the children, is beginning a new career, and cannot afford\nto pay such a large arrearage. We disagree.\n   [19-21] In determining whether to order retroactive support,\na court must consider the parties’ status, character, situation,\nand attendant circumstances. See Cooper v.

During this time, he was paying\nonly $69 a month in child support. Despite his increased salary,\nhe continued to pay only $69 in support without interference\nuntil February 2011, when the State petitioned the court to\nincrease his child support obligation. The trial court awarded\nchild support retroactively from March 2011, the first month\nafter the filing of the modification application. This retroac-\ntive award keeps with the principle that a noncustodial parent\nshould not gratuitously benefit from delays in the legal sys-\ntem when he or she should, and is able to, pay an increased\namount of child support.

Tax Exemption\n   Del argues that the trial court erred in making his tax depen-\ndency exemption dependent on his being current in paying\nchild support. We disagree.\n   [22,23] The federal government allows taxpayers to\nexclude from their income an exemption amount for each\nindividual who is a dependent of the taxpayer in the tax-\nable year. I.R.C. § 151(c) (2006). Because a tax dependency\nexemption is an economic benefit nearly identical in nature\nto an award of child support or alimony, a trial court may\nexercise its equitable powers to allocate dependency exemp-\ntions between the custodial and noncustodial parent. See\nProchaska v. Proschaka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251744\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251744/prochaska-v-prochaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb. Ct.

Although a custodial parent is presumptively entitled\nto a tax dependency exemption, a trial court may use its\nequitable powers to allocate the exemption to a noncustodial\nparent if the situation of the parties so requires. See, I.R.C.\n§ 152(c)(4)(B)(i) (2006); State on behalf of Pathammavong\nv.

If Del\nis not current on his child support, then he is not supporting\nthe minor in the way the court deemed necessary.

Attorney Fees\n   Del argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\nawarding Coleen attorney fees, because the parties have\nsimilar incomes and Coleen refused to cooperate with Del.\nWe disagree.\n   [24-27] Attorney fees are recoverable in Nebraska only\nwhen provided for by law or allowed by custom.
