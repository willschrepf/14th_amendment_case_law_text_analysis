KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n               No. 15–584   Decided March 7, 2016\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, dis-\nsenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   The First Amendment prohibits the government from\n“abridging the freedom of speech.” But the Court has\nstruggled with how that guarantee applies when private\nspeech occurs on government property. We have afforded\nprivate speech different levels of protection depending on\nthe forum in which it occurs. See Pleasant Grove City v.\nSummum, 555 U. S. 460, 469–470 (2009). In a “traditional\npublic forum”—namely, public streets or parks—speech\nrestrictions must be “narrowly tailored to serve a compel-\nling government interest.” Id., at 469. That same stand-\nard governs speech restrictions within a “ ‘designated\npublic forum,’ ” which exists “if government property that\nhas not traditionally been regarded as a public forum is\nintentionally opened up for that purpose.” Ibid. But if the\ngovernment creates a limited public forum (also called a\nnonpublic forum)—namely, “a forum that is limited to use\nby certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of\ncertain subjects”—then speech restrictions need only be\n“reasonable and viewpoint neutral.” Id., at 470.\n   Distinguishing between designated and limited public\nforums has proved difficult. We have said that whether\nthe government created a designated public forum de-\npends on its intent—as evidenced by its “policy and prac-\ntice” and “the nature of the [government] property and its\ncompatibility with expressive activity.”      Cornelius v.\nNAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,\n\f2       AMERICAN FREEDOM DEFENSE INITIATIVE v.\n                    KING COUNTY\n                  THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n802 (1985). But what this guidance means has bedeviled\nfederal courts.\n   This case involves a type of forum that has prompted\nespecially stark divisions among federal courts of appeals:\nadvertising in public transit spaces. A plurality of this\nCourt has concluded that a public transit authority that\ncategorically prohibits advertising involving political\nspeech does not create a designated public forum. Lehman\nv. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 300–302 (1974). But\nmany transit authorities have instead opened their adver-\ntising spaces to a wide array of political speech, and courts\nof appeals are divided on what type of forum this creates.\nTransit authorities in Chicago, Detroit, New York City,\nand Washington, D. C., are bound by rulings that classify\ntheir ad spaces as designated public forums and, thus,\nprohibit content-based restrictions on advertising. Transit\nauthorities in Boston—and, in this case, Seattle—are\nsimilarly open to political speech, yet can freely restrict\nspeech based on its content. Whether public transit ad-\nvertising spaces are designated or limited public forums\ndetermines what speech millions of Americans will—or\nwill not—encounter during their commutes.\n   This case offers an ideal opportunity to bring clarity to\nan important area of First Amendment law. In the deci-\nsion below, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit held that Seattle public transit advertising space is a\nlimited public forum. The court then allowed the transit\nauthority to exclude ads submitted by the American Free-\ndom Defense Initiative (AFDI)—petitioner here—by apply-\ning content-based advertising restrictions.

And, like many transit authorities, King County\nsubjects proposed ads to a preapproval process. Its policy\nfor evaluating ads prohibits political campaign advertis-\ning, but allows other political messages. Political mes-\nsages, however, cannot be displayed if the county deems\nthem “false or misleading,” “demeaning and disparaging,” or a\nrisk to the orderly operation of the transit system. 2014\nWL 345245, *4 (WD Wash., Jan. 30, 2014).\n   King County has approved many controversial political\nads. Transit bus exteriors have proclaimed “Save Gaza!\nJustice for all.” Riders have encountered ads urging\nwomen to visit a pro-life crisis pregnancy center to discuss\nabortion alternatives.      Ads have championed “Equal\nRights for Palestinians[:] The Way to Peace,” and an-\nnounced, “The Palestinian Authority Is Calling For A Jew-\nFree State[:] Equal Rights for Jews.” King County even\ninitially accepted an ad that would have emblazoned\n“Israeli War Crimes[,] Your Tax Dollars At Work” on\nbuses—before withdrawing that acceptance based on\nthreats of violence. See Seattle Mideast Awareness Cam-\npaign v. King County, 781 F. 3d 489, 494 (CA9 2015)\n(SeaMAC).\n   In 2013, the State Department and the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI) launched a campaign to encourage\nanyone in Seattle—an international travel hub—to report\ninformation about wanted terrorists. To that end, the\nState Department submitted ads for King County’s ap-\nproval to run on bus exteriors.\n   Consistent with a campaign aimed at soliciting infor-\nmation about wanted terrorists, one ad displayed the\nnames and faces of 16 wanted terrorists beneath the\nwords “Faces of Global Terrorism.” Appendix, infra. The\nbottom of this ad announced: “Stop a Terrorist. Save\nLives. Up to $25 Million Reward.” Ibid. The ad included\n\f4       AMERICAN FREEDOM DEFENSE INITIATIVE v.\n                    KING COUNTY\n                  THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncontact information for the Rewards for Justice Program,\nwhich offers substantial monetary rewards for information\nhelping to locate wanted terrorists. See ibid. King\nCounty’s Transit Advertising Program Project Manager\ninterpreted the ad as a conventional “ ‘wanted poster’ ” and\napproved it. Record in No. 2:13–CV–01804 (WD Wash.)\n(Record), Doc. 14, pp. 4–5 (Shinbo decl.). The ad started\nappearing on buses in June 2013. Ibid.\n  King County then received a “small” number of com-\nplaints. Id., at 6. Faultfinders complained that juxtapos-\ning the words “Faces of Global Terrorism” next to “pictures\nof persons of color with Muslim-sounding names . . . sug-\ngested that all similar persons were dangerous terrorists,”\nand that “just to depict men of certain races is . . . incendi-\nary itself.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). A\nSeattle-area U. S. Congressman echoed these objections.\nThe State Department voluntarily withdrew the ad.\n  Weeks later, petitioner AFDI—an advocacy group that\nseeks to convey its views on terrorism by buying public\ntransit ad space—submitted a proposed ad. See Appendix,\ninfra. Like the State Department ad, AFDI’s ad was\ncaptioned “Faces of Global Terrorism.” Ibid. And like the\nState Department ad, AFDI’s ad displayed the same 16\nphotos of wanted terrorists, with their names beneath. At\nthe bottom of the ad, AFDI included slightly different text.\nWhereas the State Department ad concluded “Stop a\nTerrorist. Save Lives. Up to $25 Million Reward,” AFDI’s\nad concluded: “AFDI Wants You to Stop a Terrorist. The\nFBI Is Offering Up To $25 Million Reward If You Help\nCapture One Of These Jihadis.” Ibid.\n  King County rejected AFDI’s ad as inconsistent with its\npolicy. First, King County deemed the ad “false or mis-\nleading,” because the Government was not offering a $25\nmillion reward for any depicted terrorist, and because the\nState Department, not the FBI, offers the rewards. Rec-\nord, Doc. 13, pp. 7–8 (Desmond decl.). Second, King\n\f                    Cite as: 577 U.

Id., at 9.\n  AFDI sued, but the District Court rejected AFDI’s First\nAmendment challenge. It reasoned that the transit sys-\ntem’s advertising space was a limited public forum, and\nthat King County’s restrictions were reasonable and view-\npoint neutral. 2014 WL 345245, at *4–*7. The Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. It agreed that King County’s transit ad\nspace was a limited public forum, and considered the\nrejection of AFDI’s ad as “false or misleading” to be rea-\nsonable and viewpoint neutral. 796 F. 3d 1165, 1168–1172\n(2015). It did not reach King County’s other rationales.\nIbid.\n                               II\n  In the large portions of this country encompassed by the\nSecond, Sixth, Seventh, and D. C. Circuits, AFDI’s ad\nwould likely have met a different fate. In those Circuits,\naccepting a wide array of political and issue-related ads\ndemonstrates that the government intended to create a\ndesignated (rather than limited) public forum because\n“political advertisements . . . [are] the hallmark of a public\nforum.” AFDI v. Suburban Mobility Auth. for Regional\nTransp., 698 F. 3d 885, 890 (CA6 2012).* In those Cir-\n——————\n   * Accord, New York Magazine v. Metropolitan Transp. Auth., 136\nF. 3d 123, 130 (CA2 1998) (“[T]he advertising space on the outside of\n[transit] buses is a designated public forum, because the [authority]\naccepts both political and commercial advertising”); Lebron v. Washing-\nton Metropolitan Area Transit Auth., 749 F. 2d 893, 896, and n. 6\n(CADC 1984) (“[T]he Authority here, by accepting political advertising,\nhas made its subway stations into public fora”); Air Line Pilots Assn.\nInt’l v.

There,\n“a transit agency’s decision to allow the display of contro-\nversial advertising does not in and of itself establish a\ndesignated public forum.” AFDI v. Massachusetts Bay\nTransp. Auth., 781 F. 3d 571, 580 (CA1 2015); see Sea-\nMAC, 781 F. 3d, at 498–499 (similar); see also 796 F. 3d,\nat 1168 (decision below, relying on SeaMAC). As the\nNinth Circuit acknowledged, this approach conflicts with\nthe approaches of “other courts [that] have held that simi-\nlar transit advertising programs constitute designated\npublic forums.” SeaMAC, supra, at 498–499. Materially\nsimilar public transit advertising programs should not\nface such different First Amendment constraints based on\ngeographical happenstance.\n  This case would allow us to resolve that division. King\nCounty’s advertising restrictions cannot pass muster if the\ntransit advertising space is a designated public forum.\nKing County bans ads that it deems “false or misleading,”\nbut this Court considers broad, content-based restrictions\non false statements in political messages to be generally\nimpermissible. See United States v. Alvarez, 567 U. S.\n___, ___–___ (2012) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5–6); see\nid., at ___–___ (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (slip\nop., at 8–10). King County’s prohibitions on “demeaning\nand disparaging” ads, or ads that could disrupt the transit\nsystem by alienating riders, are also problematic content-\nbased restrictions. King County may wish to protect\n——————\nadvertisements have been permitted in the past”); Planned Parenthood\nAssn./Chicago Area v.

California, 403 U. S. 15, 21\n(1971). The government cannot automatically “shut off\ndiscourse solely to protect others from hearing it.” Ibid.\n   To be sure, this case involves speech that some may\nconsider offensive, on a politically charged subject. That is\nall the more reason to grant review. “[A] principal func-\ntion of free speech . . . is to invite dispute. It may indeed\nbest serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of\nunrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are,\nor even stirs people to anger.” Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S.\n397, 408–409 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Many of the Court’s landmark First Amendment deci-\nsions have involved contentious speech in times of na-\ntional turmoil. When some States branded the civil rights\nmovement a threat to public order, the Court decided\nwhether protesters against segregation could be punished\nfor purportedly disrupting the peace. E.g., Cox v. Louisi-\nana, 379 U. S. 536, 537–538 (1965). When the Nation was\ndivided over the Vietnam War, the Court decided whether\nthe First Amendment prohibits the Government from\nprosecuting a man for wearing a “ ‘ “F— the Draft” ’ ” jacket\nin a courthouse, Cohen, supra, at 16, and whether a public\nschool could punish students who wear black armbands as\nsymbols of antiwar protest, Tinker v. Des Moines Inde-\npendent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 504\n(1969). More recently, we have decided whether protest-\ners can brandish signs proclaiming “ ‘God Hates Fags’ ”\nand “ ‘God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11’ ” outside a\nsoldier’s funeral, Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. 443, 447–448\n(2011); whether the First Amendment protects videos that\ndepict women crushing small animals to death to satisfy\nviewers’ sexual fetishes, United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. 460, 464–466 (2010); and whether States can reject\nConfederate-flag license plates, Walker v.

It raises an important constitutional\nquestion on which there is an acknowledged and well-\ndeveloped division among the Courts of Appeals. One of\nthis Court’s most basic functions is to resolve this kind\nof question. I respectfully dissent from the denial of\ncertiorari.\n\f                   Cite as: 577 U.

(internal quotation marks omitted). A\nSeattle-area U. S. Congressman echoed these objections.\nThe State Department voluntarily withdrew the ad.\n  Weeks later, petitioner AFDI—an advocacy group that\nseeks to convey its views on terrorism by buying public\ntransit ad space—submitted a proposed ad. See Appendix,\ninfra. Like the State Department ad, AFDI’s ad was\ncaptioned “Faces of Global Terrorism.” Ibid. And like the\nState Department ad, AFDI’s ad displayed the same 16\nphotos of wanted terrorists, with their names beneath. At\nthe bottom of the ad, AFDI included slightly different text.\nWhereas the State Department ad concluded “Stop a\nTerrorist. Save Lives. Up to $25 Million Reward,” AFDI’s\nad concluded: “AFDI Wants You to Stop a Terrorist. The\nFBI Is Offering Up To $25 Million Reward If You Help\nCapture One Of These Jihadis.” Ibid.\n  King County rejected AFDI’s ad as inconsistent with its\npolicy. First, King County deemed the ad “false or mis-\nleading,” because the Government was not offering a $25\nmillion reward for any depicted terrorist, and because the\nState Department, not the FBI, offers the rewards.

Id., at 9.\n  AFDI sued, but the District Court rejected AFDI’s First\nAmendment challenge.

In those Circuits,\naccepting a wide array of political and issue-related ads\ndemonstrates that the government intended to create a\ndesignated (rather than limited) public forum because\n“political advertisements . . .

Materially\nsimilar public transit advertising programs should not\nface such different First Amendment constraints based on\ngeographical happenstance.\n  This case would allow us to resolve that division. King\nCounty’s advertising restrictions cannot pass muster if the\ntransit advertising space is a designated public forum.\nKing County bans ads that it deems “false or misleading,”\nbut this Court considers broad, content-based restrictions\non false statements in political messages to be generally\nimpermissible.
