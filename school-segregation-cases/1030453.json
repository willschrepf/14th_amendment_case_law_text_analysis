The plaintiff  class comprises  all present,\r\n\n  future, and  potential  Brown University  women students  who\r\n\n  participate, seek  to participate, and/or  are deterred  from\r\n\n  participating in intercollegiate athletics funded by Brown.\r\n\n            This suit was initiated in response to the demotion\r\n\n  in  May 1991  of  Brown's women's  gymnastics and  volleyball\r\n\n  teams  from university-funded varsity  status to donor-funded\r\n\n  varsity status.   Contemporaneously, Brown demoted two  men's\r\n\n  teams, water polo and  golf, from university-funded to donor-\r\n\n  funded varsity status.  As a consequence  of these demotions,\r\n\n  all four teams lost,  not only their university funding,  but\r\n\n  most of the support and privileges that accompany university-\r\n\n  funded varsity status at Brown.  \r\n\n            Prior  to the trial on the merits that gave rise to\r\n\n  this appeal, the  district court  granted plaintiffs'  motion\r\n\n  for class  certification  and denied  defendants'  motion  to\r\n\n  dismiss.    Subsequently,  after  hearing  fourteen  days  of\r\n\n  testimony,  the district court granted plaintiffs' motion for\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n  a  preliminary  injunction, ordering,  inter  alia,  that the\r                                                              \r\n\n  women's gymnastics  and  volleyball teams  be  reinstated  to\r\n\n  university-funded varsity status,  and prohibiting Brown from\r\n\n  eliminating or reducing the status or funding of any existing\r\n\n  women's  intercollegiate varsity  team  until  the  case  was\r\n\n  resolved on the merits.

A  panel of this court\r                                              \r\n\n  affirmed the district court's decision granting a preliminary\r\n\n  injunction to the plaintiffs.  Cohen v.

In  so doing,  we\r                                                  \r\n\n  upheld  the  district  court's  analysis and  ruled  that  an\r\n\n  institution   violates   Title   IX   if   it   ineffectively\r\n\n  accommodates  its  students'   interests  and  abilities   in\r\n\n  athletics  under 34 C.F.R.    106.41(c)(1) (1995), regardless\r\n\n  of its performance with respect to other Title IX areas.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  at 897. \r\n\n            On remand,  the district court  determined after  a\r\n\n  lengthy  bench trial  that Brown's  intercollegiate athletics\r\n\n  program  violates Title  IX and  its  supporting regulations.\r\n\n  Cohen v. Brown  Univ., 879  F. Supp. 185,  214 (D.R.I.  1995)\r                                 \r\n\n  (\"Cohen III\").   The district  court ordered Brown  to submit\r                       \r\n\n  within  120  days a  comprehensive  plan  for complying  with\r\n\n  Title IX,  but  stayed  that  portion of  the  order  pending\r\n\n  appeal.   Id.    The  district court  subsequently  issued  a\r                         \r\n\n  modified order,  requiring Brown to submit  a compliance plan\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n  within 60 days.  Modified Order of May 4, 1995.   This action\r\n\n  was taken to ensure  that the Order was \"final\"  for purposes\r\n\n  of  this court's  jurisdiction,  and to  expedite the  appeal\r\n\n  process.  Id.  Finding that Brown's proposed compliance  plan\r                         \r\n\n  was not comprehensive and  that it failed to comply  with the\r\n\n  opinion  and order of Cohen III,  the district court rejected\r                                           \r\n\n  the plan and  ordered in its place specific relief consistent\r\n\n  with  Brown's  stated  objectives  in formulating  the  plan.\r\n\n  Order of August 17, 1995  at 11.  The court's remedial  order\r\n\n  required Brown  to elevate and  maintain at university-funded\r\n\n  varsity status the  women's gymnastics, fencing,  skiing, and\r\n\n  water polo teams.  Id. at 12.  The  district court's decision\r                                  \r\n\n  to  fashion specific  relief  was  made,  in part,  to  avoid\r\n\n  protracted  litigation  over  the   compliance  plan  and  to\r\n\n  expedite the appeal  on the issue  of liability.  Id.  at 11.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  The district  court  entered final  judgment on  September 1,\r\n\n  1995,  and on September  27, 1995, denied  Brown's motion for\r\n\n  additional  findings of fact and to amend the judgment.  This\r\n\n  appeal followed.\r\n\n            Brown  claims error in  certain evidentiary rulings\r\n\n  made  during the trial and  in the district  court's order of\r\n\n  specific relief in place of Brown's proposed compliance plan.\r\n\n  In addition, and as in  the previous appeal, Brown challenges\r\n\n  on constitutional and statutory  grounds the test employed by\r\n\n  the   district   court   in   determining   whether   Brown's\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n  intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.  In\r\n\n  the  first  appeal, a  panel  of  this  court elucidated  the\r\n\n  applicable legal  framework, upholding the  substance of  the\r\n\n  district court's interpretation and application of the law in\r\n\n  granting  plaintiffs' motion  for a  preliminary injunction,1\r\n\n  and  rejecting essentially  the  same  legal arguments  Brown\r\n\n  makes here.\r\n\n            Brown contends  that we  are free to  disregard the\r\n\n  prior  panel's explication of the  law in Cohen  II.  Brown's\r                                                               \r\n\n  efforts to circumvent the controlling effect  of Cohen II are\r                                                                     \r\n\n  unavailing,  however,  because, under  the  law  of the  case\r\n\n  doctrine,  we are bound in  this appeal, as  was the district\r\n\n  court on  remand, by the prior panel's rulings of law.  While\r\n\n  we acknowledge that the  law of the case doctrine  is subject\r\n\n  to  exceptions, we conclude that none  applies here, and that\r\n\n  the  decision rendered by the prior panel in the first appeal\r\n\n  is not,  as Brown claims, \"legally  defective.\"  Accordingly,\r\n\n  we decline Brown's invitation  to undertake plenary review of\r\n\n  issues decided in the  previous appeal and treat Cohen  II as\r                                                                      \r\n\n  controlling authority, dispositive of  the core issues raised\r\n\n  here.  \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  1.  The prior  panel upheld  the district court's  rulings in\r\n  all respects save one.  We held that the district court erred\r\n  in placing upon Brown  the burden of proof under  prong three\r\n  of  the   three-part  test  used  to   determine  whether  an\r\n  intercollegiate athletics  program  complies with  Title  IX,\r\n  discussed infra.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903.  \r                                      \r\n\n                               -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n            We find  no error  in the district  court's factual\r\n\n  findings  or in its interpretation and application of the law\r\n\n  in determining that Brown violated  Title IX in the operation\r\n\n  of its  intercollegiate  athletics  program.    We  therefore\r\n\n  affirm  in all  respects  the district  court's analysis  and\r\n\n  rulings  on the  issue of  liability.   We do,  however, find\r\n\n  error in the  district court's award  of specific relief  and\r\n\n  therefore  remand   the  case  to  the   district  court  for\r\n\n  reconsideration of the remedy in light of this opinion.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            The   relevant   facts,   legal   principles,   and\r\n\n  procedural  history  of this  case  have  been set  forth  in\r\n\n  exhaustive  detail in  the previous  opinions issued  in this\r\n\n  case.  Thus, we recite the  facts as supportably found by the\r\n\n  district court in the course of the bench trial on the merits\r\n\n  in a somewhat abbreviated fashion. \r\n\n            As  a Division  I  institution within  the National\r\n\n  Collegiate  Athletic Association (\"NCAA\") with respect to all\r\n\n  sports but football, Brown  participates at the highest level\r\n\n  of NCAA competition.2  Cohen III, 879 F. Supp. at 188.  Brown\r                                            \r\n\n  operates a two-tiered  intercollegiate athletics program with\r\n\n  respect to  funding:   although Brown provides  the financial\r\n\n  resources required to maintain its  university-funded varsity\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  2.  Brown's  football team  competes  in  Division I-AA,  the\r\n  second  highest level of NCAA competition.  Cohen III, 879 F.\r                                                                 \r\n  Supp. at 188 n.4.\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n  teams,  donor-funded varsity  athletes must  themselves raise\r\n\n  the funds  necessary to  support their teams  through private\r\n\n  donations.   Id. at 189.   The district court noted  that the\r                            \r\n\n  four  demoted  teams  were  eligible  for  NCAA  competition,\r\n\n  provided  that they were able to raise the funds necessary to\r\n\n  maintain a sufficient level  of competitiveness, and provided\r\n\n  that they continued to comply with NCAA requirements.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n  189 n.6.  The  court found, however, that it is difficult for\r\n\n  donor-funded   varsity  athletes  to   maintain  a  level  of\r\n\n  competitiveness  commensurate with  their abilities  and that\r\n\n  these athletes  operate  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in\r\n\n  comparison  to university-funded  varsity athletes.    Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n  189.  For example, the district court found that some schools\r\n\n  are reluctant to include  donor-funded teams in their varsity\r\n\n  schedules3 and  that donor-funded teams are  unable to obtain\r\n\n  varsity-level  coaching,  recruits,  and  funds  for  travel,\r\n\n  equipment, and post-season competition.  Id. at 189-90. \r                                                        \r\n\n            Brown's decision  to demote the  women's volleyball\r\n\n  and  gymnastics teams and the men's water polo and golf teams\r\n\n  from university-funded varsity status  was apparently made in\r\n\n  response to a university-wide  cost-cutting directive.  Cohen\r                                                                         \r\n\n  I, 809 F. Supp. at 981.  The district court  found that Brown\r             \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  3.  Two schools  declined to include Brown  in future varsity\r\n  schedules when women's volleyball was demoted to donor-funded\r\n  status.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 892 n.2; Cohen I, 809 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n  at 993.\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n  saved $62,028 by  demoting the women's  teams and $15,795  by\r\n\n  demoting the  men's teams,  but that the  demotions \"did  not\r\n\n  appreciably affect the  athletic participation gender ratio.\"\r\n\n  Cohen III at 187 n.2.  \r                     \r\n\n            Plaintiffs  alleged   that,  at  the  time  of  the\r\n\n  demotions,  the men  students  at Brown  already enjoyed  the\r\n\n  benefits  of a  disproportionately  large share  of both  the\r\n\n  university  resources   allocated   to  athletics   and   the\r\n\n  intercollegiate   participation  opportunities   afforded  to\r\n\n  student athletes.  Thus, plaintiffs contended, what  appeared\r\n\n  to  be the even-handed demotions of two men's and two women's\r\n\n  teams, in fact,  perpetuated Brown's discriminatory treatment\r\n\n  of  women  in  the   administration  of  its  intercollegiate\r\n\n  athletics program.       In  the  course  of the  preliminary\r\n\n  injunction  hearing, the  district court  found that,  in the\r\n\n  academic   year  1990-91,  Brown  funded  31  intercollegiate\r\n\n  varsity  teams, 16 men's teams and 15 women's teams, Cohen I,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  809  F.  Supp. at  980, and  that,  of the  894 undergraduate\r\n\n  students competing on these  teams, 63.3% (566) were  men and\r\n\n  36.7% (328) were women, id. at 981.  During the same academic\r                                       \r\n\n  year,  Brown's  undergraduate   enrollment  comprised   52.4%\r\n\n  (2,951) men and 47.6% (2,683) women.  Id.  The district court\r                                                     \r\n\n  also summarized  the history of athletics  at Brown, finding,\r\n\n  inter alia, that, while nearly all of the men's varsity teams\r                      \r\n\n  were established  before 1927,  virtually all of  the women's\r\n\n                               -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n  varsity  teams  were created  between  1971  and 1977,  after\r\n\n  Brown's  merger with Pembroke College.  Id.  The only women's\r                                                       \r\n\n  varsity team created  after this period was  winter track, in\r\n\n  1982.  Id.   \r                      \r\n\n            In  the course  of  the trial  on  the merits,  the\r\n\n  district  court  found  that,  in  1993-94,  there  were  897\r\n\n  students participating in intercollegiate  varsity athletics,\r\n\n  of which 61.87% (555)  were men and 38.13% (342)  were women.\r\n\n  Cohen  III, 879 F.  Supp. at  192.   During the  same period,\r                      \r\n\n  Brown's undergraduate enrollment comprised 5,722 students, of\r\n\n  which  48.86% (2,796) were men and 51.14% (2,926) were women.\r\n\n  Id.   The  district  court found  that,  in 1993-94,  Brown's\r               \r\n\n  intercollegiate athletics  program consisted of 32  teams, 16\r\n\n  men's teams  and 16 women's teams.   Id.  Of  the university-\r                                                    \r\n\n  funded  teams, 12 were men's teams and 13 were women's teams;\r\n\n  of the donor-funded  teams, three were women's teams and four\r\n\n  were men's teams.  Id.   At the time of trial,  Brown offered\r                                  \r\n\n  479  university-funded varsity positions for men, as compared\r\n\n  to 312 for women;  and 76 donor-funded varsity  positions for\r\n\n  men, as  compared to 30 for women.   Id. at 211.  In 1993-94,\r                                                    \r\n\n  then, Brown's  varsity program -- including  both university-\r\n\n  and donor-funded  sports -- afforded over  200 more positions\r\n\n  for  men than  for  women.   Id.  at 192.   Accordingly,  the\r                                            \r\n\n  district court found that Brown maintained a 13.01% disparity\r\n\n  between female participation in intercollegiate athletics and\r\n\n                               -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n  female student enrollment,  id. at 211, and that  \"[a]lthough\r                                           \r\n\n  the number of  varsity sports  offered to men  and women  are\r\n\n  equal,  the  selection  of  sports  offered  to  each  gender\r\n\n  generates far  more individual  positions  for male  athletes\r\n\n  than for female athletes,\" id. at 189. \r                                          \r\n\n            In  computing  these  figures, the  district  court\r\n\n  counted  as participants  in  intercollegiate  athletics  for\r\n\n  purposes of Title IX analysis those athletes who were members\r\n\n  of  varsity  teams  for the  majority  of  the  last complete\r\n\n  season.  Id. at 192.  Brown argued at trial that \"there is no\r                        \r\n\n  consistent measure of actual participation rates because team\r\n\n  size varies throughout the  athletic season,\" and that \"there\r\n\n  is  no  consistent  measure  of  actual  participation  rates\r\n\n  because  there are  alternative definitions  of 'participant'\r\n\n  that   yield  very   different  participation   totals.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Reasoning that \"[w]here both  the athlete and coach determine\r\n\n  that  there is a place  on the team for a  student, it is not\r\n\n  for this  Court to second-guess their judgment and impose its\r\n\n  own, or anyone  else's, definition of  a valuable or  genuine\r\n\n  varsity  experience,\"  the  district  court   concluded  that\r\n\n  \"[e]very  varsity   team  member   is  therefore   a  varsity\r\n\n  'participant.'\"  Id.

As to prong  three, the district  court found that\r                      \r\n\nBrown had  not \"fully  and effectively accommodated  the interest\r                               \r\n\nand ability of the underrepresented sex  'to the extent necessary\r\n\nto provide  equal  opportunity in  the  selection of  sports  and\r\n\nlevels  of competition available to members of both sexes.'\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(quoting the Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed.

The  district  court\r                   \r\n\nconcluded  that  intercollegiate  athletics opportunities  \"means\r\n\nreal opportunities,  not illusory  ones, and therefore  should be\r\n\nmeasured by counting actual participants.\"  Id. at 204  (internal\r                                                         \r\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).        \r\n\n            Title IX  is an anti-discrimination  statute, modeled\r\n\nafter Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.   2000d\r\n\n(\"Title VI\").8   See Cannon,  441 U.S. at  696 (\"The drafters  of\r                                     \r\n\nTitle IX  explicitly assumed  that it  would  be interpreted  and\r\n\napplied as Title VI had been during the preceding eight years.\").\r\n\nThus, Title  IX  and  Title  VI  share  the  same  constitutional\r\n\nunderpinnings.

The concern informing  this caveat\r\n\narises when we are asked  to rule on the propriety of  a district\r\n\ncourt's grant of a  preliminary injunction (or otherwise issue  a\r\n\npreliminary ruling) without benefit of full  argument and a well-\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  \"has been said to lie half  way between stare decisis and res\r                                                                         \r\n  judicata,\"  1B Moore  at    0.404[1] n.3  (internal quotation\r                    \r\n  marks  and citation  omitted).

Both  doctrines reflect  concerns that  have long\r\n  been recognized as fundamentally important to the rule of law\r\n  -- e.g., stability, predictability, and respect  for judicial\r\n  authority --  and both doctrines  are applied  \"with more  or\r\n  less rigidity depending on which interest is served.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n  II-2.\r\n\n                               -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r\n\ndeveloped record.  In  this case, however, the record  before the\r\n\nprior panel  was \"sufficiently developed and  the facts necessary\r\n\nto  shape the  proper  legal matrix  [we]re sufficiently  clear,\"\r\n\nCohen II, 991 F.2d at 904, and nothing in the record subsequently\r                  \r\n\ndeveloped  at trial constitutes  substantially different evidence\r\n\nthat might undermine the validity of the prior panel's rulings of\r\n\nlaw.    In  considering  plaintiffs'  motion  for  a  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction  in Cohen I,  the district court  (i) \"paid meticulous\r                                \r\n\nattention  to the  parties' prospects  for success over  the long\r\n\nhaul;\" (ii) \"plainly visualized  both the factual intricacies and\r\n\nlegal  complexities that characterize Title IX litigation;\" (iii)\r\n\n\"held a lengthy adversary hearing and reviewed voluminous written\r\n\nsubmissions;\"  and  (iv)  \"correctly focused  on  the  three-part\r\n\naccommodation test.\"  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903.

Indeed, Brown\r                             \r\n\nargues  as if  the  prior  panel  had  not  decided  the  precise\r\n\nstatutory  interpretation questions  presented (which  it clearly\r\n\ndid)  and  as if  the  district court's  liability  analysis were\r\n\n                               -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r\n\ncontrary  to the law enunciated in  Cohen II (which it clearly is\r                                                      \r\n\nnot).   Finding Brown's  bare assertions to  be unpersuasive,  we\r\n\ndecline the invitation  to this court to \"change its  mind.\"  The\r\n\nprecedent  established   by  the  prior  panel   is  not  clearly\r\n\nerroneous; it  is  the law  of  this case  and  the law  of  this\r\n\ncircuit. \r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n            Brown  contends that the  district court misconstrued\r\n\nand misapplied  the three-part test.   Specifically, Brown argues\r\n\nthat the  district court's interpretation and  application of the\r\n\ntest  is irreconcilable with the statute, the regulation, and the\r\n\nagency's interpretation of the law, and effectively renders Title\r\n\nIX  an \"affirmative  action statute\"  that mandates  preferential\r\n\ntreatment  for women  by  imposing quotas  in  excess of  women's\r\n\nrelative interests and abilities in athletics.  Brown asserts, in\r\n\nthe alternative,  that if  the district court  properly construed\r\n\nthe test, then the  test itself violates Title IX and  the United\r\n\nStates Constitution.\r\n\n            We  emphasize  two  points  at the  outset.    First,\r\n\nnotwithstanding Brown's persistent invocation of the inflammatory\r\n\nterms \"affirmative  action,\" \"preference,\"  and \"quota,\"  this is\r\n\nnot an affirmative action case.  Second, Brown's efforts to evade\r\n\nthe controlling authority of Cohen II by recasting its core legal\r                                               \r\n\narguments as challenges to the \"district court's  interpretation\"\r\n\nof the law are unavailing; the primary arguments raised here have\r\n\n                               -27-\r                                         -27-\r\r\n\nalready  been  litigated and  decided adversely  to Brown  in the\r\n\nprior appeal.  \r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r\n\n            Brown's   talismanic   incantation  of   \"affirmative\r\n\naction\" has no  legal application to this case and is not helpful\r\n\nto Brown's cause.  While \"affirmative action\" may  have different\r\n\nconnotations  as a matter  of politics, as  a matter of  law, its\r\n\nmeaning  is more  circumscribed.   True affirmative  action cases\r\n\nhave  historically involved a  voluntary10 undertaking  to remedy\r\n\ndiscrimination  (as in  a program  implemented by  a governmental\r\n\nbody,  or  by a  private employer  or  institution), by  means of\r\n\nspecific  group-based  preferences  or  numerical  goals,  and  a\r\n\nspecific timetable  for achieving those goals.

Here,  gender-conscious  relief  was\r\n\nordered by  an Article  III court, constitutionally  compelled to\r\n\nhave  before it  litigants with  standing to  raise the  cause of\r\n\naction alleged; for the  purpose of providing relief upon  a duly\r\n\nadjudicated   determination   that   specific    defendants   had\r\n\ndiscriminated  against a certified class of women in violation of\r\n\na  federal anti-discrimination  statute; based  upon  findings of\r\n\nfact  that were  subject to the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.  The\r\n\nfactual problem  presented in affirmative action  cases is, \"Does\r\n\nthe evidence support a finding of discrimination such  that race-\r\n\nor gender-conscious remedial measures  are appropriate?\"  We find\r\n\nthese  multiple  indicia of  reliability  and  specificity to  be\r\n\nsufficient to answer that question in the affirmative.\r\n\n            From  the  mere fact  that  a remedy  flowing  from a\r\n\njudicial determination of discrimination is  gender-conscious, it\r\n\ndoes not follow that the remedy constitutes \"affirmative action.\"\r\n\nNor  does a  \"reverse discrimination\" claim  arise every  time an\r\n\nanti-discrimination statute  is  enforced.   While  some  gender-\r\n\nconscious relief may adversely  impact one gender -- a  fact that\r\n\nhas not  been demonstrated in this  case -- that alone  would not\r\n\n                               -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r\n\nmake the relief \"affirmative  action\" or the consequence  of that\r\n\nrelief  \"reverse discrimination.\"    To the  contrary, race-  and\r\n\ngender-conscious    remedies    are    both    appropriate    and\r\n\nconstitutionally permissible under a  federal anti-discrimination\r\n\nregime,  although such  remedial  measures are  still subject  to\r\n\nequal protection review.

This  \"relative interests\" approach posits that\r\n\nan  institution satisfies prong  three of the  three-part test by\r\n\nmeeting  the  interests  and  abilities  of the  underrepresented\r\n\ngender  only  to  the extent  that  it  meets  the interests  and\r\n\nabilities of  the overrepresented  gender.13  See  Cohen II,  991\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 899. \r\n\n            Brown  maintains that  the district  court's decision\r\n\nimposes   upon  universities   the   obligation   to  engage   in\r\n\npreferential treatment for women by requiring quotas in excess of\r\n\nwomen's relative interests  and abilities.  With respect to prong\r\n\nthree, Brown asserts that  the district court's interpretation of\r\n\nthe word  \"fully\" \"requires  universities to favor  women's teams\r\n\nand treat  them better than men's  [teams]. . . .  forces them to\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  13.

Under Cohen  II's controlling interpretation,  prong three\r                                \r\n\n\"demands not  merely some  accommodation, but full  and effective\r\n\naccommodation.

We agree  with the prior  panel and the  district court\r\n\nthat   Brown's  relative  interests  approach  \"cannot  withstand\r\n\nscrutiny on either legal  or policy grounds,\" Cohen II,  991 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  900,  because  it  \"disadvantages women  and  undermines  the\r\n\nremedial  purposes  of  Title  IX by  limiting  required  program\r\n\nexpansion for the underrepresented sex to the status quo level of\r\n\nrelative interests,\" Cohen III, 879 F.

After Cohen\r                                                                           \r\n\nII, it cannot be maintained that the relative interests  approach\r            \r\n\nis compatible with Title IX's equal accommodation principle as it\r\n\nhas been interpreted by this circuit.\r\n\n                               -40-\r                                         -40-\r\r\n\n            Brown argues that the district court's interpretation\r\n\nof  the three-part test  requires numerical proportionality, thus\r                                           \r\n\nimposing  a gender-based  quota  scheme in  contravention of  the\r\n\nstatute.  This argument  rests, in part, upon Brown's  reading of\r\n\n20  U.S.C.     1681(b)  as  a  categorical  proscription  against\r\n\nconsideration of gender parity.  Section 1681(b) provides:\r\n\n            Nothing  contained  in subsection  (a) of\r\n            this  section  shall  be  interpreted  to\r\n            require  any  educational institution  to\r\n            grant preferential or disparate treatment\r\n            to the  members of one sex  on account of\r\n            an imbalance which may exist with respect\r\n            to  the total  number  or  percentage  of\r\n            persons  of that  sex participating in or\r\n            receiving the benefits  of any  federally\r\n            supported   program   or   activity,   in\r\n            comparison  with  the  total   number  or\r\n            percentage of persons of that sex  in any\r                                                               \r\n            community, State, section or other area .\r                                                             \r\n            . . .\r\n\n20 U.S.C.A.   1681(b) (West 1990) (emphasis added).\r\n\n            The prior panel, like Brown, assumed without analysis\r\n\nthat   1681(b) applies unequivocally to intercollegiate athletics\r\n\nprograms.    We  do not  question  Cohen  II's  application of   \r                                                      \r\n\n1681(b).   We  think it important  to bear in  mind, however, the\r\n\ncongressional  concerns that inform  the proper interpretation of\r\n\nthis  provision.  Section 1681(b) was patterned after   703(j) of\r\n\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(j), and  was specifically designed\r\n\nto  prohibit quotas  in university  admissions and  hiring, based\r\n\nupon  the  percentage   of  individuals  of   one  gender  in   a\r\n\ngeographical  community.  See H.R.  Rep. No. 554,  92d Cong., 1st\r                                       \r\n\nSess.  (1971),  reprinted  in  1972  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2462,  2590-92\r                                       \r\n\n                               -41-\r                                         -41-\r\r\n\n(Additional Views);  117 Cong. Rec. 39,261-62  (1971) (remarks of\r\n\nRep. Quie); 117 Cong. Rec. 30,406, 30,409 (remarks of Sen. Bayh);\r\n\n117 Cong. Rec. 39,251-52  (remarks of Rep. Mink and  Rep. Green).\r\n\nThus,  the  legislative   history  strongly  suggests   that  the\r\n\nunderscored language defines what  is proscribed (in the contexts\r\n\nof admissions and hiring) in terms of a geographical area, beyond\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe  institution, and does not  refer to an  imbalance within the\r                                                                           \r\n\nuniversity, with respect to the representation of  each gender in\r                    \r\n\nintercollegiate athletics,  as compared  to the gender  makeup of\r\n\nthe student body.  \r\n\n            In  any event, the  three-part test is,  on its face,\r\n\nentirely  consistent with    1681(b)  because the  test does  not\r\n\nrequire preferential  or disparate  treatment for  either gender.\r                 \r\n\nNeither  the Policy  Interpretation's  three-part  test, nor  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  interpretation  of  it,  mandates  statistical\r                                                              \r\n\nbalancing; \"[r]ather, the policy interpretation merely  creates a\r\n\npresumption that a school is in compliance  with Title IX and the\r\n\napplicable   regulation  when  it  achieves  such  a  statistical\r\n\nbalance.\"  Kelley, 35 F.3d at 271. \r                           \r\n\n            The test  is also entirely consistent  with   1681(b)\r\n\nas applied  by the  prior panel  and by the  district court.   As\r\n\npreviously noted, Cohen II expressly held that \"a court assessing\r                                    \r\n\nTitle IX compliance may not find a violation solely because there\r                                                             \r\n\nis  a disparity between the gender  composition of an educational\r\n\ninstitution's  student constituency,  on  the one  hand, and  its\r\n\n                               -42-\r                                         -42-\r\r\n\nathletic programs, on  the other hand.\"   991 F.2d  at 895.   The\r\n\npanel  then  carefully  delineated  the burden  of  proof,  which\r\n\nrequires  a  Title IX  plaintiff  to  show, not  only  \"disparity\r\n\nbetween the gender composition  of the institution's student body\r\n\nand  its  athletic program,  thereby  proving  that there  is  an\r\n\nunderrepresented gender,\"  id. at 901,  but also  \"that a  second\r                                        \r\n\nelement -- unmet interest  -- is present,\" id., meaning  that the\r                                                        \r\n\nunderrepresented  gender  has  not  been  fully  and  effectively\r\n\naccommodated  by the institution's  present athletic program, id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 902 (citing 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418).  Only where the plaintiff\r\n\nmeets the burden of  proof on these elements and  the institution\r                                                          \r\n\nfails  to show as an affirmative defense a history and continuing\r\n\npractice  of program  expansion responsive  to the  interests and\r\n\nabilities  of  the  underrepresented  gender  will  liability  be\r\n\nestablished.  Surely this is a far cry from a one-step imposition\r\n\nof a gender-based quota.  \r\n\n            Brown simply ignores the fact that it  is required to\r\n\naccommodate  fully   the   interests   and   abilities   of   the\r\n\nunderrepresented gender, not because the three-part test mandates\r\n\npreferential treatment for women ab initio, but because Brown has\r                                                    \r\n\nbeen  found (under  prong one)  to have  allocated its  athletics\r\n\nparticipation opportunities so as to create a significant gender-\r\n\nbased  disparity with  respect  to these  opportunities, and  has\r\n\nfailed  (under  prong  two)  to  show  a  history and  continuing\r\n\npractice of expansion  of opportunities for  the underrepresented\r\n\n                               -43-\r                                         -43-\r\r\n\ngender.   Brown's interpretation  conflates prongs one  and three\r\n\nand distorts the three-part  test by reducing it to  an abstract,\r\n\nmechanical determination of strict numerical proportionality.  In\r\n\nshort,  Brown treats the three-part test for compliance as a one-\r\n\npart test for strict liability. \r\n\n            Brown  also  fails  to   recognize  that  Title  IX's\r\n\nremedial  focus is,  quite properly,  not on  the overrepresented\r\n\ngender, but on the underrepresented gender; in  this case, women.\r\n\nTitle IX and its  implementing regulations protect the class  for\r\n\nwhose special benefit the  statute was enacted.  See  Cannon, 441\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 694.   It is women and not men  who have historically and\r\n\nwho continue to be underrepresented in sports, not only at Brown,\r\n\nbut  at universities nationwide.  See Williams v.

Id.  In other words,\r                     \r\n\n            If  a  school,  like  Brown,  eschews the\r\n            first two benchmarks of the accommodation\r\n            test, electing to stray  from substantial\r\n            proportionality  and   failing  to  march\r\n            uninterruptedly in the direction of equal\r\n            athletic opportunity, it must comply with\r\n            the third  benchmark.    To  do  so,  the\r\n            school   must   fully   and   effectively\r\n            accommodate the underrepresented gender's\r\n            interests  and  abilities,  even if  that\r\n            requires it to give  the underrepresented\r\n            gender (in this case, women) what amounts\r\n            to   a  larger   slice  of   a  shrinking\r\n            athletic-opportunity pie.\r\n\nId. at 906.\r             \r\n\n            We think it clear that neither the Title IX framework\r\n\nnor the district court's interpretation of it mandates a  gender-\r\n\nbased  quota scheme.    In  our  view,  it  is  Brown's  relative\r\n\ninterests  approach  to  the  three-part test,  rather  than  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's interpretation,  that contravenes  the language\r\n\nand purpose of the test and of  the statute itself.  To adopt the\r\n\nrelative interests  approach would be, not only to overrule Cohen\r                                                                           \r\n\nII, but to rewrite  the enforcing agency's interpretation  of its\r            \r\n\nown  regulation  so  as  to  incorporate  an  entirely  different\r\n\nstandard  for  Title  IX  compliance.   This  relative  interests\r\n\n                               -45-\r                                         -45-\r\r\n\nstandard would entrench  and fix by  law the significant  gender-\r\n\nbased disparity in athletics  opportunities found by the district\r\n\ncourt to exist at Brown, a finding we have held to be not clearly\r\n\nerroneous.      According    to   Brown's   relative    interests\r\n\ninterpretation of  the equal accommodation principle, the gender-\r\n\nbased disparity in athletics participation opportunities at Brown\r\n\nis due to a lack  of interest on the part of its female students,\r\n\nrather than  to  discrimination, and  any attempt  to remedy  the\r\n\ndisparity is, by definition, an unlawful quota.  This approach is\r\n\nentirely contrary to \"Congress's unmistakably clear mandate  that\r\n\neducational institutions  not use  federal  monies to  perpetuate\r\n\ngender-based discrimination,\" id. at  907, and makes it virtually\r                                           \r\n\nimpossible  to  effectuate  Congress's intent  to  eliminate  sex\r\n\ndiscrimination in intercollegiate athletics.\r\n\n                                E.\r                                          E.\r\n\n            Brown  also  claims  error  in  the district  court's\r\n\nfailure to apply Title  VII standards to its analysis  of whether\r\n\nBrown's intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.\r\n\nThe  district  court rejected  the analogy  to Title  VII, noting\r\n\nthat, while Title VII  \"seeks to determine whether gender-neutral\r\n\njob openings have  been filled without regard  to gender[,] Title\r\n\nIX  . . . was designed to  address the reality that sports teams,\r\n\nunlike  the  vast  majority  of jobs,  do  have  official  gender\r                                                   \r\n\nrequirements, and this statute accordingly approaches the concept\r\n\n                               -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r\n\nof discrimination differently from Title VII.\"  Cohen III, 879 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at 205.  \r\n\n            It does not follow  from the fact that    1681(b) was\r\n\npatterned after a  Title VII provision  that Title VII  standards\r\n\nshould   be  applied  to  a  Title  IX  analysis  of  whether  an\r\n\nintercollegiate  athletics  program  equally   accommodates  both\r\n\ngenders,  as Brown contends.

Accordingly, and\r\n\nnotwithstanding Brown's protestations to the contrary, the  Title\r\n\nVII concept  of the \"qualified pool\"  has no place in  a Title IX\r\n\nanalysis  of equal  opportunities  for male  and female  athletes\r\n\nbecause women  are not \"qualified\"  to compete  for positions  on\r\n\nmen's  teams,  and vice-versa.    In  addition,  the  concept  of\r\n\n\"preference\"  does not have the  same meaning, or  raise the same\r\n\nequality concerns,  as it does  in the employment  and admissions\r\n\ncontexts.\r\n\n            Brown's approach  fails  to recognize  that,  because\r\n\ngender-segregated teams are the norm in intercollegiate athletics\r\n\nprograms,  athletics differs  from admissions  and employment  in\r\n\nanalytically material  ways.  In providing  for gender-segregated\r\n\nteams,  intercollegiate  athletics programs  necessarily allocate\r                                                                  \r\n\nopportunities separately for male and female students, and, thus,\r\n\nany  inquiry into a  claim of gender  discrimination must compare\r                                                                   \r\n\nthe athletics participation  opportunities provided for  men with\r\n\nthose  provided  for  women.    For   this  reason,  and  because\r\n\nrecruitment  of interested athletes  is at the  discretion of the\r\n\ninstitution, there  is a risk  that the institution  will recruit\r\n\nonly enough women  to fill  positions in a  program that  already\r\n\nunderrepresents women, and  that the smaller size  of the women's\r\n\nprogram   will   have   the   effect   of   discouraging  women's\r\n\nparticipation. \r\n\n                               -49-\r                                         -49-\r\r\n\n            In this  unique context, Title IX  operates to ensure\r\n\nthat the gender-segregated allocation of  athletics opportunities\r\n\ndoes  not disadvantage either gender.  Rather than create a quota\r\n\nor  preference,  this  unavoidably   gender-conscious  comparison\r\n\nmerely  provides for  the allocation  of athletics  resources and\r\n\nparticipation  opportunities   between  the   sexes  in   a  non-\r\n\ndiscriminatory  manner.     As  the  Seventh   Circuit  observed,\r\n\n\"Congress itself  recognized  that addressing  discrimination  in\r\n\nathletics  presented a unique set of problems not raised in areas\r\n\nsuch  as employment  and  academics.\"   Kelley,  35 F.3d  at  270\r                                                        \r\n\n(citing  Sex  Discrimination  Regulations,  Hearings  Before  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nSubcommittee  on Post  Secondary  Education of  the Committee  on\r                                                                           \r\n\nEducation and Labor, 94th Cong.,  1st Sess. at 46, 54,  125, 129,\r                             \r\n\n152, 177, 299-300  (1975); 118 Cong.

Rec. 30,407 (1971) (same)).\r\n\n            In   contrast  to   the  employment   and  admissions\r\n\ncontexts, in the athletics context,  gender is not an  irrelevant\r\n\ncharacteristic.   Courts and institutions  must have some  way of\r\n\ndetermining whether  an institution complies with  the mandate of\r\n\nTitle  IX  and  its   supporting  regulations  to  provide  equal\r\n\nathletics opportunities  for both genders, despite  the fact that\r\n\nthe  institution  maintains single-sex  teams,  and  some way  of\r\n\nfashioning  a remedy  upon a  determination that  the institution\r\n\ndoes not  equally and  effectively accommodate the  interests and\r\n\nabilities of both  genders.  As the Kelley Court  pointed out (in\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -50-\r                                         -50-\r\r\n\nthe context of analyzing the deference due the relevant athletics\r\n\nregulation and the Policy Interpretation):\r\n\n            Undoubtedly  the  agency responsible  for\r\n            enforcement  of  the  statute could  have\r\n            required  schools  to  sponsor a  women's\r\n            program for every  men's program  offered\r\n            and  vice  versa.  .   .  .  It  was  not\r\n            unreasonable, however, for the  agency to\r\n            reject this course  of action.  Requiring\r\n            parallel  teams is a  rigid approach that\r\n            denies schools the flexibility to respond\r\n            to  the  differing athletic  interests of\r\n            men   and  women.     It   was  perfectly\r\n            acceptable, therefore, for the  agency to\r\n            chart  a different  course  and adopt  an\r\n            enforcement    scheme    that    measures\r\n            compliance  by analyzing how a school has\r\n            allocated its various athletic resources.\r\n\nKelley, 35 F.3d at 271 (footnotes omitted).\r                \r\n\n            Each prong of the Policy  Interpretation's three-part\r\n\ntest determines compliance in this manner.\r\n\n            Measuring    compliance    through     an\r\n            evaluation  of  a school's  allocation of\r\n            its  athletic  resources  allows  schools\r\n            flexibility   in  meeting   the  athletic\r\n            interests of their students and increases\r\n            the  chance that the  actual interests of\r\n            those  students  will  be met.    And  if\r\n            compliance  with   Title  IX  is   to  be\r\n            measured through this  sort of  analysis,\r\n            it  is only  practical  that  schools  be\r\n            given  some clear  way to  establish that\r\n            they have satisfied  the requirements  of\r\n            the    statute.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -51-\r                                         -51-\r\r\n\nCohen  II, 991  F.2d at 901  (\"[T]here is  no need  to search for\r                   \r\n\nanalogies where,  as  in the  Title  IX milieu,  the  controlling\r\n\nstatutes  and regulations  are clear.\").   We  conclude that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's application  of  the three-part  test does  not\r\n\ncreate a gender-based quota  and is consistent with Title  IX, 34\r\n\nC.F.R.    106.41, the Policy  Interpretation, and the  mandate of\r\n\nCohen II. \r                  \r\n\n                                F.\r                                          F.\r\n\n            Brown has  contended throughout this  litigation that\r\n\nthe significant disparity in  athletics opportunities for men and\r\n\nwomen  at Brown is the  result of a  gender-based differential in\r\n\nthe level of  interest in  sports and that  the district  court's\r\n\napplication  of  the  three-part test  requires  universities  to\r\n\nprovide  athletics  opportunities for  women  to  an extent  that\r\n\nexceeds their relative interests and abilities in sports.   Thus,\r\n\nat the heart  of this litigation is the question whether Title IX\r\n\npermits  Brown to deny  its female students  equal opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in sports, based upon its unproven assertion that the\r\n\ndistrict court's finding of  a significant disparity in athletics\r\n\nopportunities  for   male  and  female  students   reflects,  not\r\n\ndiscrimination in Brown's  intercollegiate athletics program, but\r\n\na lack of  interest on the  part of its  female students that  is\r\n\nunrelated to a lack of opportunities.  \r\n\n            We  view   Brown's  argument  that   women  are  less\r\n\ninterested   than   men  in   participating   in  intercollegiate\r\n\n                               -52-\r                                         -52-\r\r\n\nathletics, as well as its conclusion  that institutions should be\r\n\nrequired to accommodate the interests and abilities of its female\r\n\nstudents only  to the extent  that it accommodates  the interests\r\n\nand abilities of  its male  students, with great  suspicion.   To\r\n\nassert  that  Title  IX  permits institutions  to  provide  fewer\r\n\nathletics  participation opportunities  for women  than for  men,\r\n\nbased upon the premise  that women are less interested  in sports\r\n\nthan are men,  is (among  other things) to  ignore the fact  that\r\n\nTitle  IX was  enacted  in order  to  remedy discrimination  that\r\n\nresults  from  stereotyped  notions  of  women's  interests   and\r\n\nabilities.  \r\n\n            Interest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum; they\r\n\nevolve as a function  of opportunity and experience.   The Policy\r\n\nInterpretation   recognizes   that   women's   lower    rate   of\r\n\nparticipation in athletics  reflects women's  historical lack  of\r\n\nopportunities  to participate  in sports.   See  44 Fed.

We conclude  that, even if it\r\n\ncan be empirically demonstrated that, at a particular time, women\r\n\nhave less interest in sports than do men, such evidence, standing\r\n\nalone, cannot justify providing fewer athletics opportunities for\r\n\nwomen than  for men.   Furthermore,  such evidence is  completely\r\n\nirrelevant where, as here,  viable and successful women's varsity\r\n\nteams have been demoted or eliminated.  We emphasize that, on the\r\n\nfacts of this case, Brown's lack-of-interest  arguments are of no\r\n\nconsequence.  As  the prior panel recognized, while  the question\r\n\nof full  and effective  accommodation of athletics  interests and\r\n\nabilities  is potentially  a complicated  issue where  plaintiffs\r\n\nseek to create a new team or to elevate to  varsity status a team\r\n\nthat  has never competed at the varsity level, no such difficulty\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  programs, and physical education classes, id.  \r                                                         \r\n            As the  district court  noted, however,  the agency\r\n  characterizes  surveys as  a  \"simple way  to identify  which\r\n  additional sports  might appropriately be created  to achieve\r\n  compliance. . . .

Under these\r\n\ncircumstances,  the  district  court's  finding  that  there  are\r\n\ninterested women able to compete at the university-funded varsity\r\n\nlevel,  Cohen III,  879  F.

See, e.g., Mike Tharp\r                                                               \r\n\net al., Sports  crazy! Ready, set,  go.

This approach\r\n\ncontravenes the purpose of the statute and the regulation because\r\n\nit does not permit an institution or a district court to remedy a\r\n\ngender-based disparity in athletics  participation opportunities.\r\n\nInstead,  this approach  freezes that  disparity by  law, thereby\r\n\ndisadvantaging further the underrepresented gender.

As Brown\r\n\nputs  it, \"[t]he  [equal  protection] violation  arises from  the\r\n\ncourt's holding that  Title IX requires the imposition of quotas,\r\n\npreferential treatment, and disparate treatment in the absence of\r\n\na compelling state interest and a determination that the remedial\r\n\nmeasure is 'narrowly  tailored' to serve  that interest.\"   Reply\r\n\nBr. at 18 (citing Adarand, --- U.S. at ---, 115 S.

It  is  well  settled  that  the   reach  of  the  equal\r\n  protection  guarantee  of  the Fifth  Amendment  Due  Process\r\n  Clause  -- the basis for Brown's equal protection claim -- is\r\n  coextensive  with  that  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Equal\r\n\n                               -62-\r                                         -62-\r\r\n\nstatutory  scheme.

Thus, to\r\n\nthe  extent that  Brown challenges  the statutory  scheme itself,\r\n\nthat  challenge is foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine.\r\n\nNevertheless, the  remedy ordered for  a violation  of a  federal\r\n\nanti-discrimination statute is still  subject to equal protection\r\n\nreview, assuming that it constitutes  gender-conscious government\r\n\naction.   See  Miller,  --- U.S.  at  ---, 115  S.  Ct. at  2491.\r                               \r\n\nTherefore,  we  review  the  constitutionality  of  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  order  requiring  Brown  to  comply  with  Title  IX  by\r\n\naccommodating fully and effectively  the athletics interests  and\r\n\nabilities  of  its  women   students.    Because  the  challenged\r\n\nclassification  is gender-based,  it must  be analyzed  under the\r\n\nintermediate scrutiny  test.  Before proceeding  to the analysis,\r\n\nhowever, we must  first address Brown's challenge to the standard\r\n\nof review.  \r\n\n            Brown concedes that  Adarand \"does not,  in partially\r                                                  \r\n\noverruling Metro  Broadcasting, set forth the  proper standard of\r                                        \r\n\nreview for this  case.\"   Appellant's Br. at  29.   Nevertheless,\r\n\nBrown asserts  that \"[w]hile Adarand  is a case  involving racial\r                                              \r\n\nclassification,   its  analysis   clearly   applies   to   gender\r\n\nclassification as  well.\"  Id.  at 27.

This case\r\n\npresents  the issue of the legality of a federal district court's\r\n\ndetermination, based  upon adjudicated  findings of fact,  that a\r\n\nfederal anti-discrimination statute has been violated, and of the\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  21.  In Frontiero,  a plurality  of the Court  concluded that\r                             \r\n  gender-based  classifications,  \"like  classifications  based\r\n  upon  race,  alienage,  or  national origin,  are  inherently\r\n  suspect, and  must therefore be subjected  to strict judicial\r\n  scrutiny.\"  411 U.S. at 688.  In the 23 years that have since\r\n  elapsed, this  position has never commanded a majority of the\r\n  Court,  and has never been  adopted by this  court.  Whatever\r\n  may be the merits of adopting strict scrutiny as the standard\r\n  to  be  applied   to  gender-based  classifications,   it  is\r\n  inappropriate  to  suggest,  as  Brown does,  that  Frontiero\r                                                                         \r\n  compels its application here.  \r\n             Brown's  assertion  that  Adarand  obligates  this\r                                                        \r\n  court to apply Croson  to its equal protection claim  is also\r                                 \r\n  incorrect.   As  noted previously,  Croson is  an affirmative\r                                                      \r\n  action  case and  does  not  control  review  of  a  judicial\r\n  determination that a federal anti-discrimination  statute has\r\n  been  violated.  To the extent that Brown assumes that Croson\r                                                                         \r\n  governs the issue of the sufficiency of the factual predicate\r\n  required  to uphold  a  federally mandated,  benign race-  or\r\n  gender-based   classification,   that   assumption  is   also\r\n  unfounded.   As we have explained,  Croson's factual concerns\r                                                      \r\n  are  not  raised  by  a  district  court's  determination  --\r\n  predicated  upon  duly adjudicated  factual  findings bearing\r\n  multiple indicia of reliability  and specificity -- of gender\r\n  discrimination in  violation of a  federal statute.   We also\r\n  point  out that  Adarand did  not reach  the question  of the\r                                    \r\n  sufficiency  of the  factual  predicate  required to  satisfy\r\n  strict scrutiny  review of a  congressionally mandated  race-\r\n  based classification.  \r\n\n                               -64-\r                                         -64-\r\r\n\nstatutory  and  constitutional propriety  of the  judicial remedy\r\n\nordered to provide  redress to plaintiffs with standing  who have\r\n\nbeen injured by the violation. \r\n\n            Second,   Adarand  does   not  even   discuss  gender\r                                       \r\n\ndiscrimination, and  its holding  is limited to  explicitly race-\r\n\nbased classifications.  --- U.S. at ---, 115  S. Ct. at 2113.  It\r\n\ncan  hardly be assumed that the Court intended to include gender-\r                                \r\n\nbased classifications within  Adarand's precedential scope or  to\r                                               \r\n\nelevate, sub silentio, the level  of scrutiny to be applied by  a\r                               \r\n\nreviewing court to such classifications.\r\n\n            Third, even if Adarand did apply, it does not dictate\r                                            \r\n\nthe  level of  scrutiny  to be  applied  in this  case, as  Brown\r\n\nconcedes.    For the  last twenty  years,  the Supreme  Court has\r\n\napplied  intermediate   scrutiny  to  all  cases   raising  equal\r\n\nprotection challenges to gender-based  classifications, including\r\n\nthe  Supreme  Court's  most  recent  gender discrimination  case,\r\n\nUnited States v.

While  the Virginia\r                                                                         \r\n  Court made liberal use  of the phrase \"exceedingly persuasive\r\n  justification,\"   and   sparse   use   of   the   formulation\r\n  \"substantially   related   to   an   important   governmental\r\n  objective,\"  the Court nevertheless  struck down  the gender-\r\n  based  admissions   policy  at  issue  in   that  case  under\r\n  intermediate scrutiny, --- U.S.  at ---, 116 S. Ct.  at 2271,\r\n  2275;  id.  at  2288  (Rehnquist,  C.J.,  concurring  in  the\r                      \r\n\n                               -65-\r                                         -65-\r\r\n\n            Fourth, it is important to recognize that controlling\r\n\nauthority  does  not  distinguish  between  invidious and  benign\r\n\ndiscrimination in the context of gender-based classifications, as\r\n\nit  has in the context  of racial classifications.   Neither this\r\n\ncourt nor the  Supreme Court  has drawn this  distinction in  the\r\n\ncontext  of gender  discrimination  claims or  held  that a  less\r\n\nstringent standard applies in cases involving benign, rather than\r\n\ninvidious, gender discrimination.

We also find  that judicial enforcement  of federal\r\n\nanti-discrimination   statutes   is   at   least   an   important\r\n\ngovernmental objective. \r\n\n            Applying  the   second  prong  of   the  intermediate\r\n\nscrutiny  test, we find that  the means employed  by the district\r\n\ncourt  in  fashioning  relief  for the  statutory  violation  are\r\n\nclearly  substantially  related  to these  important  objectives.\r\n\nIntermediate scrutiny does not require that there be no other way\r\n\nto accomplish the objectives, but even if that were the standard,\r\n\nit  would be  satisfied in  the unique  context presented  by the\r\n\napplication of Title IX to athletics.  \r\n\n            As explained  previously, Title  IX as it  applies to\r\n\nathletics is  distinct from other anti-discrimination  regimes in\r\n\nthat  it is  impossible to  determine compliance  or to  devise a\r\n\nremedy  without counting and  comparing opportunities with gender\r\n\nexplicitly in mind.   Even under the individual rights  theory of\r\n\nequal  protection, reaffirmed in Adarand, --- U.S. at ---, 115 S.\r                                                  \r\n\n                               -67-\r                                         -67-\r\r\n\nCt. at 2112 (the  equal protection guarantee \"protect[s] persons,\r\n\nnot groups\"),  the only way to determine whether the rights of an\r\n\nindividual  athlete  have  been   violated  and  what  relief  is\r\n\nnecessary to remedy the  violation is to engage in  an explicitly\r\n\ngender-conscious comparison.  Accordingly, even assuming that the\r\n\nthree-part  test  creates  a gender  classification  that  favors\r\n\nwomen, allowing consideration of gender in determining the remedy\r\n\nfor  a  Title  IX  violation serves  the  important  objective of\r\n\n\"ensur[ing]   that   in    instances   where   overall   athletic\r\n\nopportunities decrease, the actual opportunities available to the\r\n\nunderrepresented gender  do not.\"   Kelley, 35  F.3d at 272.   In\r                                                    \r\n\naddition, a gender-conscious  remedial scheme is constitutionally\r\n\npermissible  if  it  directly   protects  the  interests  of  the\r\n\ndisproportionately burdened gender.   See Hogan, 458  U.S. at 728\r                                                         \r\n\n(\"In   limited   circumstances,  a   gender-based  classification\r\n\nfavoring  one  sex can  be  justified  if  it  intentionally  and\r\n\ndirectly assists  members of  the sex that  is disproportionately\r\n\nburdened.\").\r\n\n            Under  Brown's interpretation of the three-part test,\r\n\nthere can never be a  remedy for a violation of Title  IX's equal\r\n\nopportunity  mandate.   In concluding  that the  district court's\r\n\ninterpretation and  application of the three-part  test creates a\r\n\nquota,  Brown errs, in part,  because it fails  to recognize that\r\n\n(i) the substantial proportionality test of prong one is only the\r\n\nstarting point, and not the conclusion, of the analysis; and (ii)\r\n\n                               -68-\r                                         -68-\r\r\n\nprong  three is  not implicated  unless a  gender-based disparity\r\n\nwith  respect to athletics  participation opportunities  has been\r\n\nshown to exist.  Where such a disparity has been established, the\r\n\ninquiry under prong three is whether the athletics interests  and\r\n\nabilities   of  the   underrepresented  gender   are   fully  and\r\n\neffectively accommodated, such that  the institution may be found\r\n\nto comply with Title IX, notwithstanding the disparity.23  \r\n\n            Of course,  a remedy that requires  an institution to\r\n\ncut, add, or elevate the  status of athletes or entire teams  may\r\n\nimpact the genders differently, but this will be so only if there\r\n\nis   a   gender-based  disparity   with   respect  to   athletics\r\n\nopportunities to  begin with, which  is the only  circumstance in\r\n\nwhich  prong three  comes into play.   Here, however,  it has not\r\n\nbeen shown that Brown's men students will be disadvantaged by the\r\n\nfull and  effective accommodation of the  athletics interests and\r\n\nabilities of its women students.\r\n\n                               VI.\r                                         VI.\r\n\n            Brown assigns error to the district court's exclusion\r\n\nof  certain  evidence  pertaining   to  the  relative   athletics\r\n\ninterests of  men  and women.

Under  the three-part  test,  the institution  may  also\r\n  excuse the disparity under prong  two, by showing a  \"history\r\n  and   continuing  practice  of  program  expansion  which  is\r\n  demonstrably  responsive  to   the  developing  interest  and\r\n  abilities of the [underrepresented  gender],\" 44 Fed.

Because\r\n\nDr. Sabor's direct testimony  did not address this issue,  it was\r\n\nwithin the district court's discretion to limit cross-examination\r\n\n\"to the subject matter of the direct examination.\"  Fed.

Although the\r\n\ndistrict court  excluded as full  exhibits two studies,  the NCAA\r\n\nGender Equity Study and  the results of an undergraduate  poll on\r\n\nstudent interest in athletics, it nevertheless permitted  Brown's\r\n\nexperts to rely  on the data contained in these  two reports as a\r\n\nbasis  for  their expert  opinions.24    Because Brown's  experts\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  24.

In criticizing  another  facet of  Brown's plan,  the\r\n\ndistrict court pointed out that\r\n\n            [a]n institution does  not provide  equal\r\n            opportunity  if it  caps its  men's teams\r\n            after  they  are well-stocked  with high-\r\n            caliber recruits  while requiring women's\r\n            teams to boost numbers by accepting walk-\r\n            ons.   A  university  does not  treat its\r\n            men's and  women's  teams equally  if  it\r\n            allows  the coaches of men's teams to set\r\n            their  own  maximum  capacity limits  but\r\n            overrides  the  judgment  of  coaches  of\r\n            women's teams on the same matter.\r\n\nId. at 8-9.\r             \r\n\n            After rejecting Brown's proposed plan, but bearing in\r\n\nmind Brown's stated objectives,  the district court fashioned its\r\n\nown remedy:\r\n\n            I  have  concluded  that  Brown's  stated\r\n            objectives  will  be  best  served  if  I\r\n            design  a remedy to meet the requirements\r\n            of prong three rather than prong one.  In\r\n            order to bring Brown into compliance with\r\n            prong one under  defendants' Phase II,  I\r\n            would have  to order Brown  to cut enough\r\n            men's  teams  to eradicate  approximately\r\n            213  men's  varsity   positions.     This\r\n            extreme  action is  entirely unnecessary.\r\n\n                               -75-\r                                         -75-\r\r\n\n            The easy answer lies in ordering Brown to\r\n            comply with prong  three by upgrading the\r\n            women's gymnastics,  fencing, skiing, and\r\n            water  polo  teams  to  university-funded\r\n            varsity status.  In this way, Brown could\r\n            easily achieve prong three's  standard of\r\n            \"full and effective accommodation  of the\r\n            underrepresented sex.\"  This remedy would\r\n            entail   upgrading   the   positions   of\r\n            approximately  40  women.  In   order  to\r\n            finance   the   40   additional   women's\r\n            positions, Brown certainly will  not have\r\n            to  eliminate as  many as  the 213  men's\r\n            positions that would be cut under Brown's\r\n            Phase  II  proposal.    Thus,  Brown will\r\n            fully comply with Title IX by meeting the\r\n            standards   of   prong   three,   without\r\n            approaching satisfaction of the standards\r\n            of prong one.  \r\n\n            It is  clearly in  the  best interest  of\r\n            both the male and the  female athletes to\r\n            have an increase in women's opportunities\r\n            and   a   small    decrease   in    men's\r\n            opportunities, if necessary, rather than,\r\n            as  under Brown's  plan,  no increase  in\r                                                  \r\n            women's   opportunities   and   a   large\r                                                               \r\n            decrease    in    men's    opportunities.\r\n            Expanding women's  athletic opportunities\r\n            in  areas where  there is  proven ability\r\n            and interest is the very purpose of Title\r\n            IX  and  the simplest,  least disruptive,\r\n            route to Title IX compliance at Brown.\r\n\nId. at 11-12.\r             \r\n\n            The  district  court  ordered Brown  to  \"elevate and\r\n\nmaintain women's gymnastics, women's  water polo, women's skiing,\r\n\nand women's fencing to university-funded varsity status.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n12.   The court stayed this part  of the order pending appeal and\r\n\nfurther ordered that, in  the interim, the preliminary injunction\r\n\nprohibiting  Brown  from  eliminating  or  demoting  any existing\r\n\nwomen's varsity team would remain in effect.  Id.\r                                                           \r\n\n                               -76-\r                                         -76-\r\r\n\n            We  agree  with  the  district   court  that  Brown's\r\n\nproposed  plan fell  short of  a good  faith  effort to  meet the\r\n\nrequirements of Title IX as explicated  by this court in Cohen II\r                                                                           \r\n\nand as applied by the district court on remand.  Indeed, the plan\r\n\nis replete with argumentative  statements more appropriate for an\r\n\nappellate brief.  It  is obvious that Brown's plan  was addressed\r\n\nto this court,  rather than to offering a  workable solution to a\r\n\ndifficult problem.\r\n\n            It  is clear, nevertheless,  that Brown's proposal to\r\n\ncut men's teams is a permissible means of effectuating compliance\r\n\nwith  the statute.   Thus,  although  we understand  the district\r\n\ncourt's reasons  for substituting  its own specific  relief under\r\n\nthe circumstances at the time, and although the district  court's\r\n\nremedy  is within  the statutory  margins and  constitutional, we\r\n\nthink that  the district court  was wrong  to reject  out-of-hand\r\n\nBrown's alternative plan  to reduce the  number of men's  varsity\r\n\nteams.  After all,  the district court itself stated that  one of\r\n\nthe  compliance options available to  Brown under Title  IX is to\r\n\n\"demote or  eliminate the  requisite number of  men's positions.\"\r\n\nCohen III, 879 F. Supp. at 214.  Our respect for academic freedom\r                   \r\n\nand  reluctance  to  interject  ourselves  into  the  conduct  of\r\n\nuniversity  affairs counsels  that we  give universities  as much\r\n\nfreedom as possible in conducting their operations consonant with\r\n\nconstitutional  and statutory limits.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 906;\r                                                         \r\n\nVillanueva, 930 F.2d at 129.\r                    \r\n\n                               -77-\r                                         -77-\r\r\n\n            Brown therefore should be afforded the opportunity to\r\n\nsubmit another plan for compliance with Title IX.  The context of\r\n\nthe  case has  changed in  two significant  respects since  Brown\r\n\npresented its original plan.  First, the substantive issues  have\r\n\nbeen decided adversely to Brown.  Brown is no longer an appellant\r\n\nseeking a favorable result in the Court  of Appeals.  Second, the\r\n\ndistrict  court is not under  time constraints to  consider a new\r\n\nplan and fashion a remedy so as to expedite appeal.  Accordingly,\r\n\nwe remand the case to the district court so that Brown can submit\r\n\na  further plan for its consideration.  In all other respects the\r\n\njudgment  of the  district court  is  affirmed.   The preliminary\r\n\ninjunction issued by the district court in Cohen I,  809 F. Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\nat 1001, will remain in effect pending a final remedial order.\r\n\n                              VIII.\r                                        VIII.\r\n\n            There can be no  doubt that Title IX has  changed the\r\n\nface of women's sports as well  as our society's interest in  and\r\n\nattitude  toward women athletes  and women's sports.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nFrank DeFord, The Women  of Atlanta, Newsweek, June 10,  1996, at\r                                             \r\n\n62-71; Tharp, supra,  at 33;  Robert Kuttner,  Vicious Circle  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nExclusion,  Washington  Post, September  4,  1996,  at  A15.   In\r                   \r\n\naddition,  there  is  ample  evidence  that  increased  athletics\r\n\nparticipation opportunities for women and  young girls, available\r\n\nas a result of Title IX enforcement, have had salutary effects in\r\n\nother areas of societal concern.  See DeFord, supra, at 66. \r                                                             \r\n\n                               -78-\r                                         -78-\r\r\n\n            One  need  look   no  further  than  the   impressive\r\n\nperformances  of our country's women athletes in the 1996 Olympic\r\n\nSummer Games to see that Title IX has had a dramatic and positive\r\n\nimpact on the capabilities of our women athletes, particularly in\r\n\nteam sports.  These Olympians represent the first full generation\r\n\nof  women  to  grow  up  under  the  aegis  of  Title  IX.    The\r\n\nunprecedented  success  of these  athletes  is due,  in  no small\r\n\nmeasure, to Title IX's beneficent  effects on women's sports,  as\r\n\nthe athletes themselves have  acknowledged time and again.   What\r\n\nstimulated  this  remarkable change  in  the  quality of  women's\r\n\nathletic  competition  was not  a  sudden,  anomalous upsurge  in\r\n\nwomen's interest  in sports,  but the  enforcement of  Title IX's\r\n\nmandate of gender equity in sports.

Being  \"substantially\r\n\nrelated  to  an  important government  objective,\"  therefore, is\r\n\nconsidered  a necessary but not sufficient  condition.

First, we now have a full record before us and a set\r\n\nof  well-defined  legal  questions  presented  by the  appellant.\r\n\nTrial  on the merits has  served to focus  these questions and to\r\n\nprovide  background that allows us to consider these questions in\r\n\nthe proper context  and in detail.  In its  decision in Cohen II,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthis court  recognized and, indeed, emphasized the  fact that its\r\n\nholding was  only preliminary.

Rather than  turning that\r\n\nruling into a  permanent one,  we should review  the question  in\r\n\nlight of the full set of facts now available.\r\n\n          Second, the standard of review has  changed.  The Cohen\r                                                                           \r\n\nII  court stated that it  was adopting a  deferential standard of\r            \r\n\nreview, and that \"if . . . the district court made no clear error\r\n\nof law  or fact, we will overturn its calibration  . . . only for\r\n\nmanifest abuse  of discretion.\"  Id. at 902.  The test applied by\r                                              \r\n\nthe court was based  on \"(1) the movant's probability  of victory\r\n\non  the merits;  (2) the  potential for  irreparable harm  if the\r\n\n                               -88-\r                                         -88-\r\r\n\ninjunction is refused;  (3) the balance  of interests as  between\r\n\nthe parties . . . and (4) the public interest.\"  Id.

For  the purposes  of this appeal,  we must  review\r\n\nfindings of  fact under  a clearly  erroneous standard,  Reich v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNewspapers of New  England, Inc.,  44 F.3d 1060,  1069 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1995)  and findings of law de novo, Portsmouth v.

Because the standard has changed,\r\n\nit  is conceivable that the  result of the  analysis will change,\r\n\nmaking review appropriate.\r\n\n              II. BROWN'S EQUAL PROTECTION CHALLENGE\r                        II. BROWN'S EQUAL PROTECTION CHALLENGE\r\n\n          Appellees have  argued that  the three-prong test  does\r\n\nnot  create a  gender classification  because the  classification\r\n\napplies to  both women and  men.   Although I agree  that by  its\r\n\nwords, the test would apply to men at institutions where they are\r\n\nproportionately underrepresented in intercollegiate  athletics, I\r\n\ncannot  accept  the  argument   that,  via  this  provision,  the\r\n\nGovernment  does not classify its citizens by gender.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Virginia,     U.S.    , 116 S. Ct. 2264, 2274-76 (1996)\r                            \r\n\n(applying Equal  Protection  review to  \"gender-based  government\r\n\naction\" where Commonwealth of  Virginia attempted to maintain two\r\n\npurportedly  equal  single-sex  institutions).    Cf.  Loving  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nVirginia,  388 U.S. 1, 8-9  (1967) (stating that  even though the\r                  \r\n\nstatute  at issue applied equally to  members of different racial\r\n\nclassifications,   it   still   implicated   race-related   Equal\r\n\n                               -89-\r                                         -89-\r\r\n\nProtection  concerns,  since the  statute itself  contained race-\r\n\nconscious   classifications).    The   fact  of  gender-conscious\r\n\nclassification, even with equal  enforcement with respect to both\r\n\ngenders, requires  the application of a higher  level of scrutiny\r\n\nthan  rational  basis   review.    We  cannot   pretend  that  an\r\n\ninterpretation of a statute that contains explicit categorization\r\n\naccording  to gender  and that  has intentional  gender-conscious\r\n\neffect does not represent  gender-based government action.  Equal\r\n\nProtection  is   implicated  where  the  claim  is  made  that  a\r\n\nclassification made  by the government  intentionally subjects an\r\n\nindividual   to  treatment  different   from  similarly  situated\r\n\nindividuals  based on  an impermissible  characteristic,  such as\r\n\nrace, national  origin, or gender.

Prong One\r                      1. Prong One\r\n\n          A central issue  in this  case is the  manner in  which\r\n\nathletic  \"participation opportunities\" are  counted.  During the\r\n\n1990-91  academic year,  Brown fielded  16 men s  and  15 women s\r\n\nvarsity teams on  which 566 men and  328 women participated.   By\r\n\nthe 1993-94 year, there were 12 university-funded men s teams and\r\n\n13 university funded women s teams.  These teams included 479 men\r\n\nand 312 women.   Based  on an analysis  of membership in  varsity\r\n\nteams,  the  district  court   concluded  that  there  existed  a\r\n\n                               -90-\r                                         -90-\r\r\n\ndisparity   between   female  participation   in  intercollegiate\r\n\nathletics and female student enrollment.\r\n\n          Even assuming that membership numbers in varsity sports\r\n\nis a  reasonable proxy for participation opportunities  -- a view\r\n\nwith which I do not concur -- contact sports should be eliminated\r\n\nfrom  the  calculus.   The regulation  at  34 C.F.R.    106.41(b)\r\n\n(1995) provides that an academic institution may operate separate\r\n\nteams  for members of each sex \"where  selection of such teams is\r\n\nbased  upon  competitive  skill or  the  activity  involved  is a\r\n\ncontact sport.\"  34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).  When a team is sponsored\r\n\nonly  for one sex, however, and where \"athletic opportunities for\r\n\nmembers  of that sex have previously been limited, members of the\r\n\nexcluded  sex must  be allowed  to try-out  for the  team offered\r\n\nunless  the sport  involved is  a contact  sport,\" id.  (emphasis\r                                                                \r\n\nadded).   The  regulation, therefore,  allows schools  to operate\r\n\nsingle-sex  teams  in contact  sports.  In counting participation\r\n\nopportunities,  therefore, it does  not make sense  to include in\r\n\nthe  calculus  athletes  participating  in  contact  sports  that\r\n\ninclude only men s teams.   For example, if a  university chooses\r\n\nto  sponsor a football  team, it is  permitted to  sponsor only a\r\n\nmen s team.   Not  all sports  are  the same  and the  university\r\n\nshould be given the flexibility to determine which activities are\r\n\nmost  beneficial  to  its student  body.    By  including in  its\r\n\naccounting a  contact sport that  requires very large  numbers of\r\n\nparticipants, e.g., football, the district court skews the number\r\n\n                               -91-\r                                         -91-\r\r\n\nof  athletic  participants  --   making  it  impossible  for  the\r\n\nuniversity to  provide  both men's  and  women's teams  in  other\r\n\nsports.\r\n\n          If  the  athletes competing  in  sports  for which  the\r\n\nuniversity is  permitted to  field single-sex teams  are excluded\r\n\nfrom the  calculation of  participation rates, the  proportion of\r\n\nwomen  participants would  increase  dramatically  and prong  one\r\n\nmight be  satisfied.  If so, the inquiry ends and Brown should be\r\n\njudged to be in compliance.\r\n\n            2. Prong Two\r                      2. Prong Two\r\n\n          The  district court concluded, and the majority appears\r\n\nto  agree, that Brown failed to satisfy prong two because \"merely\r\n\nreducing program offerings to the overrepresented gender does not\r\n\nconstitute  program expansion  for the  underrepresented gender.\"\r\n\nMajority Opinion at  18.  This  is a curious  result because  the\r\n\nentire three-prong test is based on relative participation rates.\r                                                      \r\n\nProng one, for example, requires that participation opportunities\r\n\nbe provided  proportionately to enrollment, but  does not mandate\r\n\nany absolute number of such opportunities.   The district court s\r\n\nconclusion with  respect to  prong two, however,  implies that  a\r\n\nschool  must not only demonstrate that the proportion of women in\r\n\ntheir program  is growing over time,  it must also show  that the\r\n\nabsolute number of women participating is increasing.26\r                  \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  26.  This  requirement presents  a  dilemma for  a school  in\r\n  which  women  are  less  interested in  athletics,  as  Brown\r\n  contends is the case.  Under such conditions, a school may be\r\n\n                               -92-\r                                         -92-\r\r\n\n          Under  the  district court's  interpretation,  a school\r\n\nfacing  budgetary constraints must, in order to comply with prong\r\n\ntwo, increase the opportunities available to the underrepresented\r                       \r\n\ngender,  even  if  it  cannot  afford  to  do  so.   Rather  than\r\n\nrespecting  the school s  right to  determine the  role athletics\r\n\nwill  play in the future --  including reducing the opportunities\r\n\navailable  to   the  formerly  overrepresented  gender to  ensure\r\n\nproportionate  opportunities  --  the  district   court  and  the\r\n\nmajority  demand  that  the  absolute  number   of  opportunities\r                                               \r\n\nprovided to the underrepresented  gender be increased.  I  see no\r\n\npossible  justification for this interpretation -- the regulation\r\n\nis  intended to  protect against  discrimination, not  to promote\r\n\nathletics  on  college campuses.   A  school  is not  required to\r\n\nsponsor an  athletic program of any  particular size.  It  is not\r\n\nfor the courts, or  the legislature, for that matter,  to mandate\r\n\nprograms of a given  size.  The most that can be demanded is that\r\n\nathletics be provided in a non-discriminatory manner.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  the  claim   that  a  reduction   in  the\r\n\nopportunities  given   to  the   overrepresented  gender  is   an\r\n\nunacceptable  method of  coming  into compliance  with the  three\r\n\nprong test  is contrary  to both  Cohen  II and  comments of  the\r                                                     \r\n\nmajority opinion.

This  conclusion is\r                                                    \r\n\nconsistent  with Cohen II, which states that a school may achieve\r                                   \r\n\ncompliance  by  reducing  opportunities for  the  overrepresented\r\n\ngender.  See Cohen II,  991 F.2d at 898 n.15.

Reg. 71,413, 71,418 (December 11, 1979).\r\n\n          According  to the  district  court,  Brown's  athletics\r\n\nprogram   violates   prong   three   because   members   of   the\r\n\nproportionately underrepresented sex  have demonstrated  interest\r\n\nsufficient for a  university-funded varsity team  that is not  in\r\n\n                               -94-\r                                         -94-\r\r\n\nfact being funded.  The district court asserts that this is not a\r\n\nquota.   Brown, on  the other  hand, argues that  prong three  is\r\n\nsatisfied  when (1) the interests and abilities of members of the\r\n\nproportionately underrepresented gender  (2) are accommodated  to\r\n\nthe same degree as the proportionately overrepresented gender.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  narrow, literal  interpretation\r\n\nshould  be  rejected  because  prong  three  cannot  be  read  in\r\n\nisolation.   First,  as Brown  points  out, the  Regulation  that\r\n\nincludes prong three provides that, in assessing compliance under\r\n\nthe regulation, \"the governing principle in this area is that the\r\n\nathletic interests and  abilities of male and female  students be\r                                                                           \r\n\nequally  effectively accommodated.\"    Policy Interpretation,  44\r                                                                      \r\n\nFed.  Reg. 71,413, 71,414.  Thus, Brown contends, to meet \"fully\"\r\n\n-- in  an absolute  sense --  the interests  and abilities  of an\r\n\nunderrepresented   gender,  while   unmet   interest  among   the\r\n\noverrepresented  gender continues, would contravene the governing\r\n\nprinciple of \"equally effective accommodat[ion]\" of the interests\r\n\nand abilities of students of both genders.\r\n\n          It  is   also  worthwhile  to  note   that  to  \"fully\"\r\n\naccommodate the  interests and abilities of  the underrepresented\r\n\nsex  is  an extraordinarily  high  --  perhaps impossibly  so  --\r\n\nrequirement.   How could an academic institution with a large and\r\n\ndiverse  student  body  ever  \"fully\"  accommodate  the  athletic\r\n\ninterests  of its  students?   Under  even  the largest  athletic\r\n\nprogram,  it would  be surprising  to find  that there  is not  a\r\n\n                               -95-\r                                         -95-\r\r\n\nsingle student who would  prefer to participate in  athletics but\r\n\ndoes not do so because the school does not offer a program in the\r\n\nparticular sport that interests the student.  To read fully in an\r\n\nabsolute sense would make the third prong virtually impossible to\r\n\nsatisfy and, therefore, an irrelevant addition to the test.\r\n\n          This  difficulty  was  recognized in  Cohen  II,  which\r                                                                   \r\n\nstated  that \"the mere fact  that there are  some female students\r\n\ninterested  in a sport does not ipso  facto require the school to\r                                                     \r\n\nprovide  a varsity  team  in  order  to  comply  with  the  third\r\n\nbenchmark.\"  Cohen II 991 F.2d at 898.  The balance that Cohen II\r                                                                           \r\n\nadvocates  would require the institution to ensure \"participatory\r\n\nopportunities  . .  .  when, and  to  the extent  that, there  is\r\n\nsufficient interest and ability among the members of the excluded\r\n\nsex to sustain a viable team.\"  Id. (internal citations omitted).\r                                             \r\n\nThis standard  may be practical  for certain sports  that require\r\n\nlarge  teams, but what of  individual sports?   A \"viable\" tennis\r\n\nteam may require only a single player.  The same could be said of\r\n\nany individual  sport, including golf, track  and field, cycling,\r\n\nfencing,  archery, and  so  on.   Therefore,  we still  have  the\r\n\nproblem  that  to  \"fully   accommodate\"  the  interests  of  the\r\n\nunderrepresented sex may be impossible under the district court's\r\n\ninterpretation.\r\n\n          In light of the above, Brown argues that prong three is\r\n\nin  fact ambiguous with respect  to whether \"fully\"  means (1) an\r\n\ninstitution must meet 100% of the underrepresented gender's unmet\r\n\n                               -96-\r                                         -96-\r\r\n\nreasonable interest and ability, or (2)  an institution must meet\r\n\nthe  underrepresented  gender's  unmet  reasonable  interest  and\r\n\nability as fully as it meets those of the overrepresented gender.\r\n\nI  agree  with  Brown  that,  in  the  context  of  OCR's  Policy\r\n\nInterpretation, prong three is susceptible  to at least these two\r\n\nplausible interpretations.    \r\n\n          Additionally, section 1681(a),  a provision enacted  by\r\n\nCongress as part of  Title IX itself, casts doubt on the district\r\n\ncourt's reading of prong three.   20 U.S.C.   1681(a) (1988).  As\r\n\nBrown points out, Title IX, of which the Policy Interpretation is\r\n\nan   administrative   interpretation,   contains  language   that\r\n\nprohibits the ordering of preferential  treatment on the basis of\r\n\ngender due  to a failure of a program to substantially mirror the\r\n\ngender ratio  of an institution.   Specifically, with  respect to\r\n\nTitle  IX's guarantee  that no  person shall  be excluded  on the\r\n\nbasis  of sex from \"participation  in, denied the  benefits of or\r\n\nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or\r\n\nactivity receiving  Federal financial  assistance,\"  20 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1681(a),\r\n\n            [n]othing  contained  [therein] shall  be\r\n            interpreted  to  require any  educational\r\n            institution  to   grant  preferential  or\r\n            disparate treatment to the members of one\r\n            sex on account of an  imbalance which may\r\n            exist with respect to the total number or\r\n            percentage   of   persons   of  the   sex\r\n            participating   in   or   receiving   the\r\n            benefits   of  any   federally  supported\r\n            program or activity,  in comparison  with\r\n            the total number or percentage of persons\r\n            of that sex in any community.\r\n\n                               -97-\r                                         -97-\r\r\n\nId.   1681(b).   Section 1681(b) provides yet another  reason why\r             \r\n\nthe  district court's reading  of prong three  is troublesome and\r\n\nwhy Brown's reading is a reasonable alternative.\r\n\n          Since  the applicable  regulation, 34 C.F.R.    106.41,\r\n\nand  policy   interpretation,  44  Fed.  Reg.   71,418,  are  not\r\n\nmanifestly  contrary to the objectives of  Title IX, and Congress\r\n\nhas  specifically delegated  to an  agency the  responsibility to\r\n\narticulate standards governing a  particular area, we must accord\r\n\nthe  ensuing regulation considerable  deference.  Chevron, U.S.A.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

That notwithstanding, where -- as here -- the resulting\r\n\nregulation   is   susceptible   to  more   than   one  reasonable\r\n\ninterpretation, we  owe no  such deference to  the interpretation\r\n\nchosen where  the choice is  made not  by the agency  but by  the\r\n\ndistrict  court.    Therefore,  like  other  cases  of  statutory\r\n\ninterpretation, we should review  the district court's reading de\r                                                                           \r\n\nnovo.\r              \r\n\n          B.

First,  the  district court's  interpretation creates  a\r\n\nquota  scheme.   Second,  even assuming  such  a quota  scheme is\r\n\notherwise  constitutional,  appellees  have  not  pointed  to  an\r\n\n\"exceedingly  persuasive justification,\" see  Virginia, 116 S.Ct.\r                                                                \r\n\nat 2274, for this particular quota scheme.\r\n\n                               -98-\r                                         -98-\r\r\n\n            1. The Quota\r                      1. The Quota\r\n\n          I  believe that the  three prong test,  as the district\r\n\ncourt interprets  it, is a  quota.   I am in  square disagreement\r\n\nwith the majority, who believe that \"[n]o aspect of the  Title IX\r\n\nregime  at issue  in  this  case  .  .  .  mandates  gender-based\r\n\npreferences or quotas.\"   Majority  Opinion at 29.   Put  another\r\n\nway,  I agree  that  \"Title  IX  is  not  an  affirmative  action\r\n\nstatute,\"  id., but I believe  that is exactly  what the district\r                        \r\n\ncourt has made of it.   As interpreted by the district court, the\r\n\ntest constitutes an affirmative action, quota-based scheme.\r\n\n          I  am less interested  in the actual  term \"quota\" than\r\n\nthe legally cognizable characteristics that render a quota scheme\r\n\nimpermissible.   And  those characteristics  are present  here in\r\n\nspades.  I  am not persuaded by the majority's  argument that the\r\n\nthree-part test does not  constitute a quota because it  does not\r\n\npermit an agency or court to find a violation solely on the basis\r\n\nof prong one of the test; instead,  an institution must also fail\r\n\nprongs  two and  three.   As Brown  rightly argues,  the district\r\n\ncourt's  application of  the three-prong  test requires  Brown to\r\n\nallocate its athletic resources to meet the as-yet-unmet interest\r\n\nof  a member  of the  underrepresented sex,  women in  this case,\r\n\nwhile   simultaneously  neglecting   any  unmet   interest  among\r\n\nindividuals of the overrepresented  sex.  To the extent  that the\r\n\nrate of interest in  athletics diverges between men and  women at\r\n\nany   institution,  the  district  court's  interpretation  would\r\n\n                               -99-\r                                         -99-\r\r\n\nrequire  that  such  an  institution  treat  an  individual  male\r\n\nstudent's  athletic interest and  an individual  female student's\r\n\nathletic   interest   completely   differently:   one   student's\r\n\nreasonable interest would have  to be met, by law,  while meeting\r                                                           \r\n\nthe other  student's interest  would only  aggravate the  lack of\r\n\nproportionality  giving rise to the  legal duty.   \"The injury in\r\n\ncases  of  this kind  is  that  a 'discriminatory  classification\r\n\nprevent[s] . . . competition on an equal footing.'\"  Adarand, 115\r                                                                      \r\n\nS.

As a result, individual male and female students would\r\n\nbe  precluded  from  competing  against  each  other  for  scarce\r\n\nresources;  they would  instead compete  only against  members of\r\n\ntheir own gender.

Id.  However, in Kelley, the\r                                                                    \r\n  Seventh Circuit, unlike  the district court, did  not use the\r\n  three-prong test as a definitive test for liability.  Rather,\r\n  the Seventh Circuit endorsed the test as one  for compliance,\r\n  in dismissing  the plaintiff's  claims.  The  Seventh Circuit\r                                          \r\n  did  not consider the question  of whether, had the defendant\r\n\n                              -100-\r                                        -100-\r\r\n\n          The   majority  claims   that   \"neither   the   Policy\r\n\nInterpretation nor  the  district court's  interpretation of  it,\r\n\nmandates statistical  balancing.\"  Majority  Opinion at 41.   The\r                  \r\n\nlogic of this position escapes me.  A school can satisfy the test\r\n\nin  three ways.   The first prong  is met if  the school provides\r\n\nparticipation  opportunities  for  male and  female  students  in\r\n\nnumbers substantially  proportionate to their enrollments.   This\r\n\nprong surely requires statistical balancing.  The second prong is\r\n\nsatisfied if an institution that cannot meet prong one can show a\r\n\n\"continuing practice  of program expansion  which is demonstrably\r\n\nresponsive  to  the  developing  interest and  abilities  of  the\r\n\nmembers  of the underrepresented sex.\"   44 Fed.  Reg. at 71,418.\r\n\nIt can  hardly be  denied  that this  prong requires  statistical\r\n\nbalancing as it is essentially a test that requires the school to\r\n\nshow that  it is moving in the  direction of satisfying the first\r\n\nprong.  Establishing that a school is moving inexorably closer to\r\n\nsatisfying a  requirement that demands  statistical balancing can\r\n\nonly be done by  demonstrating an improvement in the  statistical\r\n\nbalance.    In  other  words,  the  second  prong  also  requires\r\n\nbalancing.  Finally, the third prong, interpreted as the majority\r\n\nadvocates, dispenses  with statistical balancing only  because it\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  University  of  Illinois  not  been in  compliance,  lack  of\r                                         \r\n  compliance  with  the three-prong  test  alone  would trigger\r                                                          \r\n  automatic liability,  nor did  the Seventh Circuit  spell out\r\n  what steps would  have been  required of defendant.   At  any\r\n  rate,  Kelley  pre-dates  the  Supreme  Court's  opinions  in\r                         \r\n  Adarand and Virginia,  meaning that it suffers from  the same\r                                \r\n  defects as Cohen II.\r                               \r\n\n                              -101-\r                                        -101-\r\r\n\nchoose to accord zero weight to one side of the  balance.  Even a\r\n\nsingle  person   with   a  reasonable   unmet  interest   defeats\r\n\ncompliance.    This standard,  in  fact,  goes farther  than  the\r\n\nstraightforward  quota test  of  prong  one.   According  to  the\r\n\ndistrict court,  the unmet interests of  the underrepresented sex\r\n\nmust be completely accommodated before any of the interest of the\r                                                    \r\n\noverrepresented gender can be accommodated.28\r\n\n          A pragmatic  overview of the effect  of the three-prong\r\n\ntest leads me to reject the majority's claim that the three-prong\r\n\ntest  does not  amount to  a quota  because it  involves multiple\r\n\nprongs.  In  my view it  is the result of  the test, and  not the\r\n\nnumber of steps involved, that should determine if a quota system\r\n\nexists.   Regardless  of how  many steps  are involved,  the fact\r\n\nremains  that  the  test  requires   proportionate  participation\r\n\nopportunities for both sexes (prong one) unless one sex is simply\r\n\nnot  interested in participating (prong  three).  It  seems to me\r\n\nthat a quota with an exception for  situations in which there are\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  28.  The  problem  with   the  majority s  argument   can  be\r\n  illustrated  with  a hypothetical  college  admissions policy\r\n  that would require proportionality  between the gender  ratio\r\n  of the  local student  aged population and  that of  admitted\r\n  students.   This  policy is  comparable to  prong one  of the\r\n  three prong test and is, without a doubt, a quota.   It is no\r\n  less  a quota if an exception exists for schools whose gender\r\n  ratio  differs from  that of the  local population  but which\r\n  admit  every applicant  of the  underrepresented gender.   It\r\n  remains a quota because  the school is forced to  admit every\r\n  female  applicant until it  reaches the requisite proportion.\r\n  Similarly, the  district court's interpretation  requires the\r\n  school to  accommodate the interests of  every female student\r\n  until proportionality is reached.\r\n\n                              -102-\r                                        -102-\r\r\n\ninsufficient interested students to  allow the school to  meet it\r\n\nremains  a  quota.    All of  the  negative  effects  of a  quota\r\n\nremain,29 and the school  can escape the quota under  prong three\r\n\nonly  by offering  preferential treatment to  the group  that has\r\n\ndemonstrated less interest in athletics.\r\n\n            2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r                      2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r\n\n          In view  of the  quota scheme  adopted by the  district\r\n\ncourt, and Congress' specific disavowal of any  intent to require\r\n\nquotas as part of Title  IX, appellees have not met their  burden\r\n\nof  showing an  \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for this\r\n\ngender-conscious exercise of  government authority.   As recently\r\n\nset forth in Virginia, \"[p]arties who seek to defend gender-based\r                               \r\n\ngovernment  action  must demonstrate  an  'exceedingly persuasive\r\n\njustification' for that action.\"  Virginia, 116 S.Ct. at 2274.\r                                                    \r\n\nWhile the Supreme Court in Virginia acknowledged that \"[p]hysical\r                                             \r\n\ndifferences between  men and  women . .  . are enduring,\"  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n2276,  it went on  to state  that such  \"'[i]nherent differences'\r\n\nbetween men and women,  we have come to appreciate,  remain cause\r\n\nfor  celebration, but not for . .  . artificial constraints on an\r\n\nindividual's opportunity.\" Id.\r                                        \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  29.  Nor  does the  second  prong  of  the  test  change  the\r\n  analysis.  That prong merely recognizes that a school may not\r\n  be able  to  meet the  quotas  of the  first or  third  prong\r\n  immediately,  and  therefore  deems  it  sufficient  to  show\r\n  program  expansion that is responsive to the interests of the\r\n  underrepresented sex.\r\n\n                              -103-\r                                        -103-\r\r\n\n          Neither   appellees   nor  the   district   court  have\r\n\ndemonstrated  an \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for the\r\n\ngovernment action  that the district  court has directed  in this\r\n\ncase.    In  fact,   appellees  have  failed  to  point   to  any\r                                                                           \r\n\ncongressional  statement or  indication  of  intent  regarding  a\r\n\nproportional  representation scheme  as applied  by the  district\r\n\ncourt.   While  they  point to  Congress'  decision  to  delegate\r\n\nauthority to the  relevant agencies,  this does not  amount to  a\r\n\ngenuine  --  that is,  not hypothesized  or  invented in  view of\r\n\nlitigation, id.  at 2275 --  exceedingly persuasive justification\r                         \r\n\nin light of section 1681(b)'s \"no  quota\" provision.  We are left\r\n\nwith  the explanations discussed in  Cohen II to  the effect that\r                                                       \r\n\nCongress  conducted hearings  on  the  subject of  discrimination\r\n\nagainst  women in  education.   There is  little more  than that,\r\n\nbecause Congress  adopted Title IX  as a floor  amendment without\r\n\ncommittee hearings or reports.  See Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 893.\r                                                      \r\n\n          I believe  that the district  court's interpretation of\r\n\nthe  Policy  Interpretation's   three-prong  test  poses  serious\r\n\nconstitutional  difficulties.   \"[W]here an  otherwise acceptable\r\n\nconstruction  of a  statute  would  raise serious  constitutional\r\n\nproblems, [we] construe the statute to avoid such problems unless\r\n\nsuch construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\"\r\n\nEdward J. DeBartolo Corp.  v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg.  &amp; Constr.\r                                                                           \r\n\nTrades  Council, 485 U.S. 568 (1988); see NLRB v.

As a result,\r\n\nI opt for Brown's construction of prong three, which, as  we have\r\n\ndiscussed, infra, is also a reasonable reading.\r                          \r\n\n          Accordingly,  I would  reverse and  remand for  further\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\n                     III. Evidentiary Issues\r                               III. Evidentiary Issues\r\n\n          In  disputes  over  the  representation  of   women  in\r\n\nathletic  programs, it  is  inevitable that  statistical evidence\r\n\nwill  be relevant.    There  is simply  no  other  way to  assess\r\n\nparticipation  rates,   interest  levels,  and  abilities.    The\r\n\nmajority  opinion, however,  offers  inconsistent  guidance  with\r\n\nrespect to the role of  statistics in Title IX claims.   Early in\r\n\nthe opinion,  the majority  approvingly cites to  the statistical\r\n\nevaluations conducted  in  Cohen  I, Cohen  II,  and  Cohen  III.\r                                                                          \r\n\nMajority  Opinion at 8-10.   The figures  in question demonstrate\r\n\nthat women s participation in athletics is less than proportional\r\n\nto their enrollment.   Later  in the opinion,  however, when  the\r\n\nlevel  of interest among  women at Brown  is at  issue, the court\r\n\nadopts  a   much  more  critical  attitude   towards  statistical\r\n\nevidence: \"[T]here exists the  danger that, rather than providing\r\n\na  true  measure  of  women s  interest  in  sports,  statistical\r\n\nevidence purporting to reflect women s interest instead  provides\r\n\nonly a  measure of the very  discrimination that is and  has been\r\n\n                              -105-\r                                        -105-\r\r\n\nthe  basis for women s lack of opportunity.\"  Majority Opinion at\r\n\n53.   In other words, evidence of differential levels of interest\r\n\nis not to be credited because it may simply reflect the result of\r\n\npast discrimination.\r\n\n          The  refusal to  accept surveys  of interest  levels as\r\n\nevidence of interest raises the question of what indicators might\r\n\nbe used.  The majority offers no guidance to a  school seeking to\r\n\nassess  the levels  of interest  of its  students.   Although the\r\n\nthree-prong  test, even  as  interpreted by  the district  court,\r\n\nappears to  allow the school  the opportunity to  show a lack  of\r\n\ninterest, the majority rejects the best -- and perhaps the only -\r\n\n- mechanism for making such a showing.\r\n\n          Brown claims that the district court erred in excluding\r\n\nevidence pertaining to the relative athletic interests of men and\r\n\nwomen  at the  university.   Brown sought  to introduce  the NCAA\r\n\nGender Equity Study and  the results of an undergraduate  poll on\r\n\nstudent  interest in athletics, but  was not permitted  to do so.\r\n\nThe majority is unsympathetic to Brown's claim that the disparity\r\n\nbetween  athletic  opportunities  for  men and  women  reflect  a\r\n\ngender-based  difference in  interest  levels.   Indeed,  despite\r\n\nBrown's  attempt to present evidence in support of its claim, the\r\n\nmajority   characterizes   Brown's  argument   as   an  \"unproven\r\n\nassertion.\"  Majority Opinion at 51.30\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  30.  Among  the   evidence  submitted   by  Brown   are:  (i)\r\n  admissions data showing greater athletic interest among  male\r\n  applicants than  female applicants;  (ii) college  board data\r\n\n                              -106-\r                                        -106-\r\r\n\n          Furthermore, the majority recognizes  that institutions\r\n\nare  entitled  to  use  any  nondiscriminatory  method  of  their\r\n\nchoosing to determine athletic interests.  Majority Opinion at 53\r\n\nn.15.  If  statistical evidence of  interest levels is not  to be\r\n\nconsidered by courts,  however, there  is no way  for schools  to\r\n\ndetermine whether they are in compliance.  Any studies or surveys\r\n\nthey might conduct in order to assess their own compliance would,\r\n\nin  the event of litigation, be deemed irrelevant.  Regardless of\r\n\nthe  efforts made by the  academic institution, the  specter of a\r\n\nlawsuit would be ever-present.\r\n\n          In  addition, the majority has put the power to control\r\n\nathletics and the provision of athletic resources in the hands of\r\n\nthe  underrepresented gender.   Virtually  every other  aspect of\r\n\ncollege life is  entrusted to the institution,  but athletics has\r\n\nnow  been carved  out as an  exception and  the university  is no\r\n\nlonger in full  control of its program.   Unless the  two genders\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  showing  greater  athletic interest  and  prior participation\r\n  rates by prospective male  applicants than female applicants;\r\n  (iii)  data  from  the  Cooperative   Institutional  Research\r\n  Program at UCLA  indicating greater  athletic interest  among\r\n  men  than women; (iv) an independent  telephone survey of 500\r\n  randomly  selected  Brown  undergraduates  that  reveals that\r\n  Brown offers  women participation opportunities in  excess of\r\n  their  representation in  the  pool of  interested, qualified\r\n  students; (v)  intramural and  club participation  rates that\r\n  demonstrate  higher participation rates among men than women;\r\n  (vi)  walk-on  and try-out  numbers  that  reflect a  greater\r\n  interest   among  men   than   women;   (vii)   high   school\r\n  participation  rates   that  show   a  much  lower   rate  of\r\n  participation among females than among males; (viii) the NCAA\r\n  Gender Equity  Committee data  showing that women  across the\r\n  country participate in athletics at a lower rate than men.\r\n\n                              -107-\r                                        -107-\r\r\n\nparticipate equally in athletics, members of the underrepresented\r\n\nsex would  have the ability to demand a varsity level team at any\r\n\ntime  if they can show sufficient interest.  Apparently no weight\r\n\nis given  to the sustainability of the  interest, the cost of the\r\n\nsport, the  university s view on  the desirability of  the sport,\r\n\nand so on.\r\n\n                    IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r                              IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r\n\n          Finally,  it  is  important  to   remember  that  Brown\r\n\nUniversity  is  a  private  institution  with a  constitutionally\r\n\nprotected  First  Amendment  right  to  choose  its   curriculum.\r\n\nAthletics  are part of that curriculum.  Although the protections\r\n\nof the First Amendment cannot  be used to justify discrimination,\r\n\nthis  court should  not forget that  it has  a duty  to protect a\r\n\nprivate  institution s   right  to  mould  its   own  educational\r\n\nenvironment.\r\n\n          The majority pays  lip service to these concerns in the\r\n\nfinal pages of its long opinion, stating  that \" we are a society\r\n\nthat  cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that universities\r\n\ndeserve great leeway in their operations. \"   Majority Opinion at\r\n\n69  (quoting Cohen II,  991 F.2d at 906),  and \"[o]ur respect for\r                               \r\n\nacademic freedom  and reluctance to interject  ourselves into the\r\n\nconduct of university affairs  counsels that we give universities\r\n\nas  much freedom as possible.\"   Majority Opinion at 75.  Despite\r\n\nthese statements, however, the majority in its opinion today, and\r\n\nthe  district  court   before  it,  have  failed  to  give  Brown\r\n\n                              -108-\r                                        -108-\r\r\n\nUniversity  freedom  to craft  its  own athletic  program  and to\r\n\nchoose  the  priorities of  that  program.    Instead, they  have\r\n\nestablished a  legal rule that  straightjackets college athletics\r\n\nprograms by curtailing  their freedom to  choose the sports  they\r\n\noffer. \r\n\n                              -109-\r                                        -109-\r\r\n",

The plaintiff  class comprises  all present,\r\n\n  future, and  potential  Brown University  women students  who\r\n\n  participate, seek  to participate, and/or  are deterred  from\r\n\n  participating in intercollegiate athletics funded by Brown.\r\n\n            This suit was initiated in response to the demotion\r\n\n  in  May 1991  of  Brown's women's  gymnastics and  volleyball\r\n\n  teams  from university-funded varsity  status to donor-funded\r\n\n  varsity status.   Contemporaneously, Brown demoted two  men's\r\n\n  teams, water polo and  golf, from university-funded to donor-\r\n\n  funded varsity status.  As a consequence  of these demotions,\r\n\n  all four teams lost,  not only their university funding,  but\r\n\n  most of the support and privileges that accompany university-\r\n\n  funded varsity status at Brown.  \r\n\n            Prior  to the trial on the merits that gave rise to\r\n\n  this appeal, the  district court  granted plaintiffs'  motion\r\n\n  for class  certification  and denied  defendants'  motion  to\r\n\n  dismiss.    Subsequently,  after  hearing  fourteen  days  of\r\n\n  testimony,  the district court granted plaintiffs' motion for\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n  a  preliminary  injunction, ordering,  inter  alia,  that the\r                                                              \r\n\n  women's gymnastics  and  volleyball teams  be  reinstated  to\r\n\n  university-funded varsity status,  and prohibiting Brown from\r\n\n  eliminating or reducing the status or funding of any existing\r\n\n  women's  intercollegiate varsity  team  until  the  case  was\r\n\n  resolved on the merits.

Finding that Brown's proposed compliance  plan\r                         \r\n\n  was not comprehensive and  that it failed to comply  with the\r\n\n  opinion  and order of Cohen III,  the district court rejected\r                                           \r\n\n  the plan and  ordered in its place specific relief consistent\r\n\n  with  Brown's  stated  objectives  in formulating  the  plan.\r\n\n  Order of August 17, 1995  at 11.  The court's remedial  order\r\n\n  required Brown  to elevate and  maintain at university-funded\r\n\n  varsity status the  women's gymnastics, fencing,  skiing, and\r\n\n  water polo teams.  Id. at 12.  The  district court's decision\r                                  \r\n\n  to  fashion specific  relief  was  made,  in part,  to  avoid\r\n\n  protracted  litigation  over  the   compliance  plan  and  to\r\n\n  expedite the appeal  on the issue  of liability.  Id.  at 11.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  The district  court  entered final  judgment on  September 1,\r\n\n  1995,  and on September  27, 1995, denied  Brown's motion for\r\n\n  additional  findings of fact and to amend the judgment.  This\r\n\n  appeal followed.\r\n\n            Brown  claims error in  certain evidentiary rulings\r\n\n  made  during the trial and  in the district  court's order of\r\n\n  specific relief in place of Brown's proposed compliance plan.\r\n\n  In addition, and as in  the previous appeal, Brown challenges\r\n\n  on constitutional and statutory  grounds the test employed by\r\n\n  the   district   court   in   determining   whether   Brown's\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n  intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.  In\r\n\n  the  first  appeal, a  panel  of  this  court elucidated  the\r\n\n  applicable legal  framework, upholding the  substance of  the\r\n\n  district court's interpretation and application of the law in\r\n\n  granting  plaintiffs' motion  for a  preliminary injunction,1\r\n\n  and  rejecting essentially  the  same  legal arguments  Brown\r\n\n  makes here.\r\n\n            Brown contends  that we  are free to  disregard the\r\n\n  prior  panel's explication of the  law in Cohen  II.  Brown's\r                                                               \r\n\n  efforts to circumvent the controlling effect  of Cohen II are\r                                                                     \r\n\n  unavailing,  however,  because, under  the  law  of the  case\r\n\n  doctrine,  we are bound in  this appeal, as  was the district\r\n\n  court on  remand, by the prior panel's rulings of law.  While\r\n\n  we acknowledge that the  law of the case doctrine  is subject\r\n\n  to  exceptions, we conclude that none  applies here, and that\r\n\n  the  decision rendered by the prior panel in the first appeal\r\n\n  is not,  as Brown claims, \"legally  defective.\"  Accordingly,\r\n\n  we decline Brown's invitation  to undertake plenary review of\r\n\n  issues decided in the  previous appeal and treat Cohen  II as\r                                                                      \r\n\n  controlling authority, dispositive of  the core issues raised\r\n\n  here.  \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  1.  The prior  panel upheld  the district court's  rulings in\r\n  all respects save one.  We held that the district court erred\r\n  in placing upon Brown  the burden of proof under  prong three\r\n  of  the   three-part  test  used  to   determine  whether  an\r\n  intercollegiate athletics  program  complies with  Title  IX,\r\n  discussed infra.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903.  \r                                      \r\n\n                               -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n            We find  no error  in the district  court's factual\r\n\n  findings  or in its interpretation and application of the law\r\n\n  in determining that Brown violated  Title IX in the operation\r\n\n  of its  intercollegiate  athletics  program.    We  therefore\r\n\n  affirm  in all  respects  the district  court's analysis  and\r\n\n  rulings  on the  issue of  liability.   We do,  however, find\r\n\n  error in the  district court's award  of specific relief  and\r\n\n  therefore  remand   the  case  to  the   district  court  for\r\n\n  reconsideration of the remedy in light of this opinion.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            The   relevant   facts,   legal   principles,   and\r\n\n  procedural  history  of this  case  have  been set  forth  in\r\n\n  exhaustive  detail in  the previous  opinions issued  in this\r\n\n  case.  Thus, we recite the  facts as supportably found by the\r\n\n  district court in the course of the bench trial on the merits\r\n\n  in a somewhat abbreviated fashion. \r\n\n            As  a Division  I  institution within  the National\r\n\n  Collegiate  Athletic Association (\"NCAA\") with respect to all\r\n\n  sports but football, Brown  participates at the highest level\r\n\n  of NCAA competition.2  Cohen III, 879 F. Supp. at 188.  Brown\r                                            \r\n\n  operates a two-tiered  intercollegiate athletics program with\r\n\n  respect to  funding:   although Brown provides  the financial\r\n\n  resources required to maintain its  university-funded varsity\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  2.  Brown's  football team  competes  in  Division I-AA,  the\r\n  second  highest level of NCAA competition.  Cohen III, 879 F.\r                                                                 \r\n  Supp. at 188 n.4.\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n  teams,  donor-funded varsity  athletes must  themselves raise\r\n\n  the funds  necessary to  support their teams  through private\r\n\n  donations.   Id. at 189.   The district court noted  that the\r                            \r\n\n  four  demoted  teams  were  eligible  for  NCAA  competition,\r\n\n  provided  that they were able to raise the funds necessary to\r\n\n  maintain a sufficient level  of competitiveness, and provided\r\n\n  that they continued to comply with NCAA requirements.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n  189 n.6.  The  court found, however, that it is difficult for\r\n\n  donor-funded   varsity  athletes  to   maintain  a  level  of\r\n\n  competitiveness  commensurate with  their abilities  and that\r\n\n  these athletes  operate  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in\r\n\n  comparison  to university-funded  varsity athletes.    Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n  189.  For example, the district court found that some schools\r\n\n  are reluctant to include  donor-funded teams in their varsity\r\n\n  schedules3 and  that donor-funded teams are  unable to obtain\r\n\n  varsity-level  coaching,  recruits,  and  funds  for  travel,\r\n\n  equipment, and post-season competition.  Id. at 189-90. \r                                                        \r\n\n            Brown's decision  to demote the  women's volleyball\r\n\n  and  gymnastics teams and the men's water polo and golf teams\r\n\n  from university-funded varsity status  was apparently made in\r\n\n  response to a university-wide  cost-cutting directive.  Cohen\r                                                                         \r\n\n  I, 809 F. Supp. at 981.  The district court  found that Brown\r             \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  3.  Two schools  declined to include Brown  in future varsity\r\n  schedules when women's volleyball was demoted to donor-funded\r\n  status.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 892 n.2; Cohen I, 809 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n  at 993.\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n  saved $62,028 by  demoting the women's  teams and $15,795  by\r\n\n  demoting the  men's teams,  but that the  demotions \"did  not\r\n\n  appreciably affect the  athletic participation gender ratio.\"\r\n\n  Cohen III at 187 n.2.  \r                     \r\n\n            Plaintiffs  alleged   that,  at  the  time  of  the\r\n\n  demotions,  the men  students  at Brown  already enjoyed  the\r\n\n  benefits  of a  disproportionately  large share  of both  the\r\n\n  university  resources   allocated   to  athletics   and   the\r\n\n  intercollegiate   participation  opportunities   afforded  to\r\n\n  student athletes.  Thus, plaintiffs contended, what  appeared\r\n\n  to  be the even-handed demotions of two men's and two women's\r\n\n  teams, in fact,  perpetuated Brown's discriminatory treatment\r\n\n  of  women  in  the   administration  of  its  intercollegiate\r\n\n  athletics program.       In  the  course  of the  preliminary\r\n\n  injunction  hearing, the  district court  found that,  in the\r\n\n  academic   year  1990-91,  Brown  funded  31  intercollegiate\r\n\n  varsity  teams, 16 men's teams and 15 women's teams, Cohen I,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  809  F.  Supp. at  980, and  that,  of the  894 undergraduate\r\n\n  students competing on these  teams, 63.3% (566) were  men and\r\n\n  36.7% (328) were women, id. at 981.  During the same academic\r                                       \r\n\n  year,  Brown's  undergraduate   enrollment  comprised   52.4%\r\n\n  (2,951) men and 47.6% (2,683) women.  Id.  The district court\r                                                     \r\n\n  also summarized  the history of athletics  at Brown, finding,\r\n\n  inter alia, that, while nearly all of the men's varsity teams\r                      \r\n\n  were established  before 1927,  virtually all of  the women's\r\n\n                               -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n  varsity  teams  were created  between  1971  and 1977,  after\r\n\n  Brown's  merger with Pembroke College.  Id.  The only women's\r                                                       \r\n\n  varsity team created  after this period was  winter track, in\r\n\n  1982.  Id.   \r                      \r\n\n            In  the course  of  the trial  on  the merits,  the\r\n\n  district  court  found  that,  in  1993-94,  there  were  897\r\n\n  students participating in intercollegiate  varsity athletics,\r\n\n  of which 61.87% (555)  were men and 38.13% (342)  were women.\r\n\n  Cohen  III, 879 F.  Supp. at  192.   During the  same period,\r                      \r\n\n  Brown's undergraduate enrollment comprised 5,722 students, of\r\n\n  which  48.86% (2,796) were men and 51.14% (2,926) were women.\r\n\n  Id.   The  district  court found  that,  in 1993-94,  Brown's\r               \r\n\n  intercollegiate athletics  program consisted of 32  teams, 16\r\n\n  men's teams  and 16 women's teams.   Id.  Of  the university-\r                                                    \r\n\n  funded  teams, 12 were men's teams and 13 were women's teams;\r\n\n  of the donor-funded  teams, three were women's teams and four\r\n\n  were men's teams.  Id.   At the time of trial,  Brown offered\r                                  \r\n\n  479  university-funded varsity positions for men, as compared\r\n\n  to 312 for women;  and 76 donor-funded varsity  positions for\r\n\n  men, as  compared to 30 for women.   Id. at 211.  In 1993-94,\r                                                    \r\n\n  then, Brown's  varsity program -- including  both university-\r\n\n  and donor-funded  sports -- afforded over  200 more positions\r\n\n  for  men than  for  women.   Id.  at 192.   Accordingly,  the\r                                            \r\n\n  district court found that Brown maintained a 13.01% disparity\r\n\n  between female participation in intercollegiate athletics and\r\n\n                               -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n  female student enrollment,  id. at 211, and that  \"[a]lthough\r                                           \r\n\n  the number of  varsity sports  offered to men  and women  are\r\n\n  equal,  the  selection  of  sports  offered  to  each  gender\r\n\n  generates far  more individual  positions  for male  athletes\r\n\n  than for female athletes,\" id. at 189. \r                                          \r\n\n            In  computing  these  figures, the  district  court\r\n\n  counted  as participants  in  intercollegiate  athletics  for\r\n\n  purposes of Title IX analysis those athletes who were members\r\n\n  of  varsity  teams  for the  majority  of  the  last complete\r\n\n  season.  Id. at 192.  Brown argued at trial that \"there is no\r                        \r\n\n  consistent measure of actual participation rates because team\r\n\n  size varies throughout the  athletic season,\" and that \"there\r\n\n  is  no  consistent  measure  of  actual  participation  rates\r\n\n  because  there are  alternative definitions  of 'participant'\r\n\n  that   yield  very   different  participation   totals.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Reasoning that \"[w]here both  the athlete and coach determine\r\n\n  that  there is a place  on the team for a  student, it is not\r\n\n  for this  Court to second-guess their judgment and impose its\r\n\n  own, or anyone  else's, definition of  a valuable or  genuine\r\n\n  varsity  experience,\"  the  district  court   concluded  that\r\n\n  \"[e]very  varsity   team  member   is  therefore   a  varsity\r\n\n  'participant.'\"  Id. (original  emphasis omitted).  Thus, the\r                                \r\n\n  district court held that \r\n\n            the \"participation opportunities\" offered\r\n            by   an   institution  are   measured  by\r\n            counting   the  actual   participants  on\r                                                           \r\n            intercollegiate  teams.

The district court noted that \"there may be other women's\r\n  club sports  with sufficient interest and  ability to warrant\r\n  elevation  to varsity  status,\" but  that plaintiffs  did not\r\n  introduce  at trial  substantial  evidence demonstrating  the\r\n  existence of  other women's club teams  meeting the criteria.\r\n  Cohen III, 879 F.

The concern informing  this caveat\r\n\narises when we are asked  to rule on the propriety of  a district\r\n\ncourt's grant of a  preliminary injunction (or otherwise issue  a\r\n\npreliminary ruling) without benefit of full  argument and a well-\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  \"has been said to lie half  way between stare decisis and res\r                                                                         \r\n  judicata,\"  1B Moore  at    0.404[1] n.3  (internal quotation\r                    \r\n  marks  and citation  omitted).   As  applied  in the  federal\r\n  courts today,  the  law of  the  case doctrine  more  closely\r\n  resembles  the  doctrine of  stare decisis.    1B Moore  at  \r                                                      \r\n  0.404[1].   Both  doctrines reflect  concerns that  have long\r\n  been recognized as fundamentally important to the rule of law\r\n  -- e.g., stability, predictability, and respect  for judicial\r\n  authority --  and both doctrines  are applied  \"with more  or\r\n  less rigidity depending on which interest is served.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n  II-2.\r\n\n                               -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r\n\ndeveloped record.  In  this case, however, the record  before the\r\n\nprior panel  was \"sufficiently developed and  the facts necessary\r\n\nto  shape the  proper  legal matrix  [we]re sufficiently  clear,\"\r\n\nCohen II, 991 F.2d at 904, and nothing in the record subsequently\r                  \r\n\ndeveloped  at trial constitutes  substantially different evidence\r\n\nthat might undermine the validity of the prior panel's rulings of\r\n\nlaw.    In  considering  plaintiffs'  motion  for  a  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction  in Cohen I,  the district court  (i) \"paid meticulous\r                                \r\n\nattention  to the  parties' prospects  for success over  the long\r\n\nhaul;\" (ii) \"plainly visualized  both the factual intricacies and\r\n\nlegal  complexities that characterize Title IX litigation;\" (iii)\r\n\n\"held a lengthy adversary hearing and reviewed voluminous written\r\n\nsubmissions;\"  and  (iv)  \"correctly focused  on  the  three-part\r\n\naccommodation test.\"  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903.

Indeed, Brown\r                             \r\n\nargues  as if  the  prior  panel  had  not  decided  the  precise\r\n\nstatutory  interpretation questions  presented (which  it clearly\r\n\ndid)  and  as if  the  district court's  liability  analysis were\r\n\n                               -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r\n\ncontrary  to the law enunciated in  Cohen II (which it clearly is\r                                                      \r\n\nnot).   Finding Brown's  bare assertions to  be unpersuasive,  we\r\n\ndecline the invitation  to this court to \"change its  mind.\"  The\r\n\nprecedent  established   by  the  prior  panel   is  not  clearly\r\n\nerroneous; it  is  the law  of  this case  and  the law  of  this\r\n\ncircuit. \r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n            Brown  contends that the  district court misconstrued\r\n\nand misapplied  the three-part test.   Specifically, Brown argues\r\n\nthat the  district court's interpretation and  application of the\r\n\ntest  is irreconcilable with the statute, the regulation, and the\r\n\nagency's interpretation of the law, and effectively renders Title\r\n\nIX  an \"affirmative  action statute\"  that mandates  preferential\r\n\ntreatment  for women  by  imposing quotas  in  excess of  women's\r\n\nrelative interests and abilities in athletics.  Brown asserts, in\r\n\nthe alternative,  that if  the district court  properly construed\r\n\nthe test, then the  test itself violates Title IX and  the United\r\n\nStates Constitution.\r\n\n            We  emphasize  two  points  at the  outset.    First,\r\n\nnotwithstanding Brown's persistent invocation of the inflammatory\r\n\nterms \"affirmative  action,\" \"preference,\"  and \"quota,\"  this is\r\n\nnot an affirmative action case.  Second, Brown's efforts to evade\r\n\nthe controlling authority of Cohen II by recasting its core legal\r                                               \r\n\narguments as challenges to the \"district court's  interpretation\"\r\n\nof the law are unavailing; the primary arguments raised here have\r\n\n                               -27-\r                                         -27-\r\r\n\nalready  been  litigated and  decided adversely  to Brown  in the\r\n\nprior appeal.  \r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r\n\n            Brown's   talismanic   incantation  of   \"affirmative\r\n\naction\" has no  legal application to this case and is not helpful\r\n\nto Brown's cause.  While \"affirmative action\" may  have different\r\n\nconnotations  as a matter  of politics, as  a matter of  law, its\r\n\nmeaning  is more  circumscribed.   True affirmative  action cases\r\n\nhave  historically involved a  voluntary10 undertaking  to remedy\r\n\ndiscrimination  (as in  a program  implemented by  a governmental\r\n\nbody,  or  by a  private employer  or  institution), by  means of\r\n\nspecific  group-based  preferences  or  numerical  goals,  and  a\r\n\nspecific timetable  for achieving those goals.

In  reviewing   equal  protection\r\n\nchallenges to such plans, the Court is concerned  that government\r\n\nbodies are  reaching out  to implement race-  or gender-conscious\r\n\nremedial measures that are \"ageless in their reach into the past,\r\n\nand  timeless in their ability to affect the future,\" Wygant, 476\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at  276, on  the basis  of facts  insufficient to support  a\r\n\nprima  facie case  of  a constitutional  or statutory  violation,\r\n\nCroson, 488 U.S. at  500, to the benefit of  unidentified victims\r                \r\n\nof past discrimination, see id. at  469; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 276.\r                                                         \r\n\nAccordingly,  the Court  has  taken the  position that  voluntary\r\n\naffirmative  action plans  cannot  be constitutionally  justified\r\n\nabsent  a  particularized  factual  predicate  demonstrating  the\r\n\n                               -32-\r                                         -32-\r\r\n\nexistence of \"identified discrimination,\" see Croson, 488 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n500-06, because \"[s]ocietal discrimination, without more,  is too\r\n\namorphous  a basis  for imposing  a racially  classified remedy,\"\r\n\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 276.    \r                \r\n\n            From a  constitutional standpoint, the case before us\r\n\nis  altogether  different.   Here,  gender-conscious  relief  was\r\n\nordered by  an Article  III court, constitutionally  compelled to\r\n\nhave  before it  litigants with  standing to  raise the  cause of\r\n\naction alleged; for the  purpose of providing relief upon  a duly\r\n\nadjudicated   determination   that   specific    defendants   had\r\n\ndiscriminated  against a certified class of women in violation of\r\n\na  federal anti-discrimination  statute; based  upon  findings of\r\n\nfact  that were  subject to the  Federal Rules of  Evidence.  The\r\n\nfactual problem  presented in affirmative action  cases is, \"Does\r\n\nthe evidence support a finding of discrimination such  that race-\r\n\nor gender-conscious remedial measures  are appropriate?\"  We find\r\n\nthese  multiple  indicia of  reliability  and  specificity to  be\r\n\nsufficient to answer that question in the affirmative.\r\n\n            From  the  mere fact  that  a remedy  flowing  from a\r\n\njudicial determination of discrimination is  gender-conscious, it\r\n\ndoes not follow that the remedy constitutes \"affirmative action.\"\r\n\nNor  does a  \"reverse discrimination\" claim  arise every  time an\r\n\nanti-discrimination statute  is  enforced.   While  some  gender-\r\n\nconscious relief may adversely  impact one gender -- a  fact that\r\n\nhas not  been demonstrated in this  case -- that alone  would not\r\n\n                               -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r\n\nmake the relief \"affirmative  action\" or the consequence  of that\r\n\nrelief  \"reverse discrimination.\"    To the  contrary, race-  and\r\n\ngender-conscious    remedies    are    both    appropriate    and\r\n\nconstitutionally permissible under a  federal anti-discrimination\r\n\nregime,  although such  remedial  measures are  still subject  to\r\n\nequal protection review.

Application of the Policy Interpretation  is not limited\r\n  to   intercollegiate   athletics,   however.

This  \"relative interests\" approach posits that\r\n\nan  institution satisfies prong  three of the  three-part test by\r\n\nmeeting  the  interests  and  abilities  of the  underrepresented\r\n\ngender  only  to  the extent  that  it  meets  the interests  and\r\n\nabilities of  the overrepresented  gender.13  See  Cohen II,  991\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 899. \r\n\n            Brown  maintains that  the district  court's decision\r\n\nimposes   upon  universities   the   obligation   to  engage   in\r\n\npreferential treatment for women by requiring quotas in excess of\r\n\nwomen's relative interests  and abilities.  With respect to prong\r\n\nthree, Brown asserts that  the district court's interpretation of\r\n\nthe word  \"fully\" \"requires  universities to favor  women's teams\r\n\nand treat  them better than men's  [teams]. . . .  forces them to\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  13.  We  note  that  Brown  presses  its  relative  interests\r\n  argument under both  prong one  and prong three.   At  trial,\r\n  Brown  argued  that,  \"in  order  to  succeed on  prong  one,\r\n  plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the percentage  of\r\n  women   among   varsity   athletes   is   not   substantially\r\n  proportionate  to the  percentage  of  women  among  students\r                                                                         \r\n  interested in  participating  in varsity  athletics.\"   Cohen\r                                                                         \r\n  III,  879 F.

Under Cohen  II's controlling interpretation,  prong three\r                                \r\n\n\"demands not  merely some  accommodation, but full  and effective\r\n\naccommodation.

We agree  with the prior  panel and the  district court\r\n\nthat   Brown's  relative  interests  approach  \"cannot  withstand\r\n\nscrutiny on either legal  or policy grounds,\" Cohen II,  991 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  900,  because  it  \"disadvantages women  and  undermines  the\r\n\nremedial  purposes  of  Title  IX by  limiting  required  program\r\n\nexpansion for the underrepresented sex to the status quo level of\r\n\nrelative interests,\" Cohen III, 879 F. Supp. at 209.  After Cohen\r                                                                           \r\n\nII, it cannot be maintained that the relative interests  approach\r            \r\n\nis compatible with Title IX's equal accommodation principle as it\r\n\nhas been interpreted by this circuit.\r\n\n                               -40-\r                                         -40-\r\r\n\n            Brown argues that the district court's interpretation\r\n\nof  the three-part test  requires numerical proportionality, thus\r                                           \r\n\nimposing  a gender-based  quota  scheme in  contravention of  the\r\n\nstatute.  This argument  rests, in part, upon Brown's  reading of\r\n\n20  U.S.C.     1681(b)  as  a  categorical  proscription  against\r\n\nconsideration of gender parity.  Section 1681(b) provides:\r\n\n            Nothing  contained  in subsection  (a) of\r\n            this  section  shall  be  interpreted  to\r\n            require  any  educational institution  to\r\n            grant preferential or disparate treatment\r\n            to the  members of one sex  on account of\r\n            an imbalance which may exist with respect\r\n            to  the total  number  or  percentage  of\r\n            persons  of that  sex participating in or\r\n            receiving the benefits  of any  federally\r\n            supported   program   or   activity,   in\r\n            comparison  with  the  total   number  or\r\n            percentage of persons of that sex  in any\r                                                               \r\n            community, State, section or other area .\r                                                             \r\n            . . .\r\n\n20 U.S.C.A.   1681(b) (West 1990) (emphasis added).\r\n\n            The prior panel, like Brown, assumed without analysis\r\n\nthat   1681(b) applies unequivocally to intercollegiate athletics\r\n\nprograms.    We  do not  question  Cohen  II's  application of   \r                                                      \r\n\n1681(b).   We  think it important  to bear in  mind, however, the\r\n\ncongressional  concerns that inform  the proper interpretation of\r\n\nthis  provision.  Section 1681(b) was patterned after   703(j) of\r\n\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(j), and  was specifically designed\r\n\nto  prohibit quotas  in university  admissions and  hiring, based\r\n\nupon  the  percentage   of  individuals  of   one  gender  in   a\r\n\ngeographical  community.  See H.R.  Rep. No. 554,  92d Cong., 1st\r                                       \r\n\nSess.  (1971),  reprinted  in  1972  U.S.C.C.A.N.  2462,  2590-92\r                                       \r\n\n                               -41-\r                                         -41-\r\r\n\n(Additional Views);  117 Cong. Rec. 39,261-62  (1971) (remarks of\r\n\nRep. Quie); 117 Cong. Rec. 30,406, 30,409 (remarks of Sen. Bayh);\r\n\n117 Cong. Rec. 39,251-52  (remarks of Rep. Mink and  Rep. Green).\r\n\nThus,  the  legislative   history  strongly  suggests   that  the\r\n\nunderscored language defines what  is proscribed (in the contexts\r\n\nof admissions and hiring) in terms of a geographical area, beyond\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe  institution, and does not  refer to an  imbalance within the\r                                                                           \r\n\nuniversity, with respect to the representation of  each gender in\r                    \r\n\nintercollegiate athletics,  as compared  to the gender  makeup of\r\n\nthe student body.  \r\n\n            In  any event, the  three-part test is,  on its face,\r\n\nentirely  consistent with    1681(b)  because the  test does  not\r\n\nrequire preferential  or disparate  treatment for  either gender.\r                 \r\n\nNeither  the Policy  Interpretation's  three-part  test, nor  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  interpretation  of  it,  mandates  statistical\r                                                              \r\n\nbalancing; \"[r]ather, the policy interpretation merely  creates a\r\n\npresumption that a school is in compliance  with Title IX and the\r\n\napplicable   regulation  when  it  achieves  such  a  statistical\r\n\nbalance.\"  Kelley, 35 F.3d at 271. \r                           \r\n\n            The test  is also entirely consistent  with   1681(b)\r\n\nas applied  by the  prior panel  and by the  district court.   As\r\n\npreviously noted, Cohen II expressly held that \"a court assessing\r                                    \r\n\nTitle IX compliance may not find a violation solely because there\r                                                             \r\n\nis  a disparity between the gender  composition of an educational\r\n\ninstitution's  student constituency,  on  the one  hand, and  its\r\n\n                               -42-\r                                         -42-\r\r\n\nathletic programs, on  the other hand.\"   991 F.2d  at 895.   The\r\n\npanel  then  carefully  delineated  the burden  of  proof,  which\r\n\nrequires  a  Title IX  plaintiff  to  show, not  only  \"disparity\r\n\nbetween the gender composition  of the institution's student body\r\n\nand  its  athletic program,  thereby  proving  that there  is  an\r\n\nunderrepresented gender,\"  id. at 901,  but also  \"that a  second\r                                        \r\n\nelement -- unmet interest  -- is present,\" id., meaning  that the\r                                                        \r\n\nunderrepresented  gender  has  not  been  fully  and  effectively\r\n\naccommodated  by the institution's  present athletic program, id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 902 (citing 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418).  Only where the plaintiff\r\n\nmeets the burden of  proof on these elements and  the institution\r                                                          \r\n\nfails  to show as an affirmative defense a history and continuing\r\n\npractice  of program  expansion responsive  to the  interests and\r\n\nabilities  of  the  underrepresented  gender  will  liability  be\r\n\nestablished.  Surely this is a far cry from a one-step imposition\r\n\nof a gender-based quota.  \r\n\n            Brown simply ignores the fact that it  is required to\r\n\naccommodate  fully   the   interests   and   abilities   of   the\r\n\nunderrepresented gender, not because the three-part test mandates\r\n\npreferential treatment for women ab initio, but because Brown has\r                                                    \r\n\nbeen  found (under  prong one)  to have  allocated its  athletics\r\n\nparticipation opportunities so as to create a significant gender-\r\n\nbased  disparity with  respect  to these  opportunities, and  has\r\n\nfailed  (under  prong  two)  to  show  a  history and  continuing\r\n\npractice of expansion  of opportunities for  the underrepresented\r\n\n                               -43-\r                                         -43-\r\r\n\ngender.   Brown's interpretation  conflates prongs one  and three\r\n\nand distorts the three-part  test by reducing it to  an abstract,\r\n\nmechanical determination of strict numerical proportionality.  In\r\n\nshort,  Brown treats the three-part test for compliance as a one-\r\n\npart test for strict liability. \r\n\n            Brown  also  fails  to   recognize  that  Title  IX's\r\n\nremedial  focus is,  quite properly,  not on  the overrepresented\r\n\ngender, but on the underrepresented gender; in  this case, women.\r\n\nTitle IX and its  implementing regulations protect the class  for\r\n\nwhose special benefit the  statute was enacted.

In other words,\r                     \r\n\n            If  a  school,  like  Brown,  eschews the\r\n            first two benchmarks of the accommodation\r\n            test, electing to stray  from substantial\r\n            proportionality  and   failing  to  march\r\n            uninterruptedly in the direction of equal\r\n            athletic opportunity, it must comply with\r\n            the third  benchmark.

In  our  view,  it  is  Brown's  relative\r\n\ninterests  approach  to  the  three-part test,  rather  than  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's interpretation,  that contravenes  the language\r\n\nand purpose of the test and of  the statute itself.  To adopt the\r\n\nrelative interests  approach would be, not only to overrule Cohen\r                                                                           \r\n\nII, but to rewrite  the enforcing agency's interpretation  of its\r            \r\n\nown  regulation  so  as  to  incorporate  an  entirely  different\r\n\nstandard  for  Title  IX  compliance.   This  relative  interests\r\n\n                               -45-\r                                         -45-\r\r\n\nstandard would entrench  and fix by  law the significant  gender-\r\n\nbased disparity in athletics  opportunities found by the district\r\n\ncourt to exist at Brown, a finding we have held to be not clearly\r\n\nerroneous.      According    to   Brown's   relative    interests\r\n\ninterpretation of  the equal accommodation principle, the gender-\r\n\nbased disparity in athletics participation opportunities at Brown\r\n\nis due to a lack  of interest on the part of its female students,\r\n\nrather than  to  discrimination, and  any attempt  to remedy  the\r\n\ndisparity is, by definition, an unlawful quota.  This approach is\r\n\nentirely contrary to \"Congress's unmistakably clear mandate  that\r\n\neducational institutions  not use  federal  monies to  perpetuate\r\n\ngender-based discrimination,\" id. at  907, and makes it virtually\r                                           \r\n\nimpossible  to  effectuate  Congress's intent  to  eliminate  sex\r\n\ndiscrimination in intercollegiate athletics.\r\n\n                                E.\r                                          E.\r\n\n            Brown  also  claims  error  in  the district  court's\r\n\nfailure to apply Title  VII standards to its analysis  of whether\r\n\nBrown's intercollegiate athletics program complies with Title IX.\r\n\nThe  district  court rejected  the analogy  to Title  VII, noting\r\n\nthat, while Title VII  \"seeks to determine whether gender-neutral\r\n\njob openings have  been filled without regard  to gender[,] Title\r\n\nIX  . . . was designed to  address the reality that sports teams,\r\n\nunlike  the  vast  majority  of jobs,  do  have  official  gender\r                                                   \r\n\nrequirements, and this statute accordingly approaches the concept\r\n\n                               -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r\n\nof discrimination differently from Title VII.\"  Cohen III, 879 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at 205.  \r\n\n            It does not follow  from the fact that    1681(b) was\r\n\npatterned after a  Title VII provision  that Title VII  standards\r\n\nshould   be  applied  to  a  Title  IX  analysis  of  whether  an\r\n\nintercollegiate  athletics  program  equally   accommodates  both\r\n\ngenders,  as Brown contends.

While the Title  IX regime\r                           \r\n\npermits institutions to maintain gender-segregated teams, the law\r                 \r\n\ndoes  not require  that  student-athletes attending  institutions\r\n\nreceiving federal funds must  compete on gender-segregated teams;\r\n\nnor  does the  law require  that institutions  provide completely\r\n\ngender-integrated athletics programs.14  To the extent that Title\r\n\nIX allows  institutions to maintain single-sex  teams and gender-\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  14.

Accordingly, and\r\n\nnotwithstanding Brown's protestations to the contrary, the  Title\r\n\nVII concept  of the \"qualified pool\"  has no place in  a Title IX\r\n\nanalysis  of equal  opportunities  for male  and female  athletes\r\n\nbecause women  are not \"qualified\"  to compete  for positions  on\r\n\nmen's  teams,  and vice-versa.    In  addition,  the  concept  of\r\n\n\"preference\"  does not have the  same meaning, or  raise the same\r\n\nequality concerns,  as it does  in the employment  and admissions\r\n\ncontexts.\r\n\n            Brown's approach  fails  to recognize  that,  because\r\n\ngender-segregated teams are the norm in intercollegiate athletics\r\n\nprograms,  athletics differs  from admissions  and employment  in\r\n\nanalytically material  ways.  In providing  for gender-segregated\r\n\nteams,  intercollegiate  athletics programs  necessarily allocate\r                                                                  \r\n\nopportunities separately for male and female students, and, thus,\r\n\nany  inquiry into a  claim of gender  discrimination must compare\r                                                                   \r\n\nthe athletics participation  opportunities provided for  men with\r\n\nthose  provided  for  women.    For   this  reason,  and  because\r\n\nrecruitment  of interested athletes  is at the  discretion of the\r\n\ninstitution, there  is a risk  that the institution  will recruit\r\n\nonly enough women  to fill  positions in a  program that  already\r\n\nunderrepresents women, and  that the smaller size  of the women's\r\n\nprogram   will   have   the   effect   of   discouraging  women's\r\n\nparticipation. \r\n\n                               -49-\r                                         -49-\r\r\n\n            In this  unique context, Title IX  operates to ensure\r\n\nthat the gender-segregated allocation of  athletics opportunities\r\n\ndoes  not disadvantage either gender.  Rather than create a quota\r\n\nor  preference,  this  unavoidably   gender-conscious  comparison\r\n\nmerely  provides for  the allocation  of athletics  resources and\r\n\nparticipation  opportunities   between  the   sexes  in   a  non-\r\n\ndiscriminatory  manner.     As  the  Seventh   Circuit  observed,\r\n\n\"Congress itself  recognized  that addressing  discrimination  in\r\n\nathletics  presented a unique set of problems not raised in areas\r\n\nsuch  as employment  and  academics.\"   Kelley,  35 F.3d  at  270\r                                                        \r\n\n(citing  Sex  Discrimination  Regulations,  Hearings  Before  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nSubcommittee  on Post  Secondary  Education of  the Committee  on\r                                                                           \r\n\nEducation and Labor, 94th Cong.,  1st Sess. at 46, 54,  125, 129,\r                             \r\n\n152, 177, 299-300  (1975); 118 Cong.

Rec. 30,407 (1971) (same)).\r\n\n            In   contrast  to   the  employment   and  admissions\r\n\ncontexts, in the athletics context,  gender is not an  irrelevant\r\n\ncharacteristic.   Courts and institutions  must have some  way of\r\n\ndetermining whether  an institution complies with  the mandate of\r\n\nTitle  IX  and  its   supporting  regulations  to  provide  equal\r\n\nathletics opportunities  for both genders, despite  the fact that\r\n\nthe  institution  maintains single-sex  teams,  and  some way  of\r\n\nfashioning  a remedy  upon a  determination that  the institution\r\n\ndoes not  equally and  effectively accommodate the  interests and\r\n\nabilities of both  genders.  As the Kelley Court  pointed out (in\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -50-\r                                         -50-\r\r\n\nthe context of analyzing the deference due the relevant athletics\r\n\nregulation and the Policy Interpretation):\r\n\n            Undoubtedly  the  agency responsible  for\r\n            enforcement  of  the  statute could  have\r\n            required  schools  to  sponsor a  women's\r\n            program for every  men's program  offered\r\n            and  vice  versa.  .   .  .  It  was  not\r\n            unreasonable, however, for the  agency to\r\n            reject this course  of action.  Requiring\r\n            parallel  teams is a  rigid approach that\r\n            denies schools the flexibility to respond\r\n            to  the  differing athletic  interests of\r\n            men   and  women.     It   was  perfectly\r\n            acceptable, therefore, for the  agency to\r\n            chart  a different  course  and adopt  an\r\n            enforcement    scheme    that    measures\r\n            compliance  by analyzing how a school has\r\n            allocated its various athletic resources.\r\n\nKelley, 35 F.3d at 271 (footnotes omitted).\r                \r\n\n            Each prong of the Policy  Interpretation's three-part\r\n\ntest determines compliance in this manner.\r\n\n            Measuring    compliance    through     an\r\n            evaluation  of  a school's  allocation of\r\n            its  athletic  resources  allows  schools\r\n            flexibility   in  meeting   the  athletic\r\n            interests of their students and increases\r\n            the  chance that the  actual interests of\r\n            those  students  will  be met.    And  if\r\n            compliance  with   Title  IX  is   to  be\r\n            measured through this  sort of  analysis,\r\n            it  is only  practical  that  schools  be\r\n            given  some clear  way to  establish that\r\n            they have satisfied  the requirements  of\r\n            the    statute.        The    substantial\r\n            proportionality contained  in Benchmark 1\r\n            merely establishes such a safe harbor.  \r\n\nId.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -51-\r                                         -51-\r\r\n\nCohen  II, 991  F.2d at 901  (\"[T]here is  no need  to search for\r                   \r\n\nanalogies where,  as  in the  Title  IX milieu,  the  controlling\r\n\nstatutes  and regulations  are clear.\").   We  conclude that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's application  of  the three-part  test does  not\r\n\ncreate a gender-based quota  and is consistent with Title  IX, 34\r\n\nC.F.R.    106.41, the Policy  Interpretation, and the  mandate of\r\n\nCohen II. \r                  \r\n\n                                F.\r                                          F.\r\n\n            Brown has  contended throughout this  litigation that\r\n\nthe significant disparity in  athletics opportunities for men and\r\n\nwomen  at Brown is the  result of a  gender-based differential in\r\n\nthe level of  interest in  sports and that  the district  court's\r\n\napplication  of  the  three-part test  requires  universities  to\r\n\nprovide  athletics  opportunities for  women  to  an extent  that\r\n\nexceeds their relative interests and abilities in sports.   Thus,\r\n\nat the heart  of this litigation is the question whether Title IX\r\n\npermits  Brown to deny  its female students  equal opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in sports, based upon its unproven assertion that the\r\n\ndistrict court's finding of  a significant disparity in athletics\r\n\nopportunities  for   male  and  female  students   reflects,  not\r\n\ndiscrimination in Brown's  intercollegiate athletics program, but\r\n\na lack of  interest on the  part of its  female students that  is\r\n\nunrelated to a lack of opportunities.  \r\n\n            We  view   Brown's  argument  that   women  are  less\r\n\ninterested   than   men  in   participating   in  intercollegiate\r\n\n                               -52-\r                                         -52-\r\r\n\nathletics, as well as its conclusion  that institutions should be\r\n\nrequired to accommodate the interests and abilities of its female\r\n\nstudents only  to the extent  that it accommodates  the interests\r\n\nand abilities of  its male  students, with great  suspicion.   To\r\n\nassert  that  Title  IX  permits institutions  to  provide  fewer\r\n\nathletics  participation opportunities  for women  than for  men,\r\n\nbased upon the premise  that women are less interested  in sports\r\n\nthan are men,  is (among  other things) to  ignore the fact  that\r\n\nTitle  IX was  enacted  in order  to  remedy discrimination  that\r\n\nresults  from  stereotyped  notions  of  women's  interests   and\r\n\nabilities.  \r\n\n            Interest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum; they\r\n\nevolve as a function  of opportunity and experience.   The Policy\r\n\nInterpretation   recognizes   that   women's   lower    rate   of\r\n\nparticipation in athletics  reflects women's  historical lack  of\r\n\nopportunities  to participate  in sports.   See  44 Fed.

We conclude  that, even if it\r\n\ncan be empirically demonstrated that, at a particular time, women\r\n\nhave less interest in sports than do men, such evidence, standing\r\n\nalone, cannot justify providing fewer athletics opportunities for\r\n\nwomen than  for men.   Furthermore,  such evidence is  completely\r\n\nirrelevant where, as here,  viable and successful women's varsity\r\n\nteams have been demoted or eliminated.  We emphasize that, on the\r\n\nfacts of this case, Brown's lack-of-interest  arguments are of no\r\n\nconsequence.  As  the prior panel recognized, while  the question\r\n\nof full  and effective  accommodation of athletics  interests and\r\n\nabilities  is potentially  a complicated  issue where  plaintiffs\r\n\nseek to create a new team or to elevate to  varsity status a team\r\n\nthat  has never competed at the varsity level, no such difficulty\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  programs, and physical education classes, id.  \r                                                         \r\n            As the  district court  noted, however,  the agency\r\n  characterizes  surveys as  a  \"simple way  to identify  which\r\n  additional sports  might appropriately be created  to achieve\r\n  compliance. . . . Thus, a survey of interests would  follow a\r                                                                       \r\n  determination  that  an institution  does  not  satisfy prong\r\n  three; it would not be utilized to make that determination in\r\n  the first  instance.\"  Cohen III,  897 F.

See, e.g., Mike Tharp\r                                                               \r\n\net al., Sports  crazy! Ready, set,  go.

This approach\r\n\ncontravenes the purpose of the statute and the regulation because\r\n\nit does not permit an institution or a district court to remedy a\r\n\ngender-based disparity in athletics  participation opportunities.\r\n\nInstead,  this approach  freezes that  disparity by  law, thereby\r\n\ndisadvantaging further the underrepresented gender.

As Brown\r\n\nputs  it, \"[t]he  [equal  protection] violation  arises from  the\r\n\ncourt's holding that  Title IX requires the imposition of quotas,\r\n\npreferential treatment, and disparate treatment in the absence of\r\n\na compelling state interest and a determination that the remedial\r\n\nmeasure is 'narrowly  tailored' to serve  that interest.\"   Reply\r\n\nBr. at 18 (citing Adarand, --- U.S. at ---, 115 S.

Thus, to\r\n\nthe  extent that  Brown challenges  the statutory  scheme itself,\r\n\nthat  challenge is foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine.\r\n\nNevertheless, the  remedy ordered for  a violation  of a  federal\r\n\nanti-discrimination statute is still  subject to equal protection\r\n\nreview, assuming that it constitutes  gender-conscious government\r\n\naction.   See  Miller,  --- U.S.  at  ---, 115  S.

Because  the  challenged\r\n\nclassification  is gender-based,  it must  be analyzed  under the\r\n\nintermediate scrutiny  test.  Before proceeding  to the analysis,\r\n\nhowever, we must  first address Brown's challenge to the standard\r\n\nof review.  \r\n\n            Brown concedes that  Adarand \"does not,  in partially\r                                                  \r\n\noverruling Metro  Broadcasting, set forth the  proper standard of\r                                        \r\n\nreview for this  case.\"   Appellant's Br. at  29.

This case\r\n\npresents  the issue of the legality of a federal district court's\r\n\ndetermination, based  upon adjudicated  findings of fact,  that a\r\n\nfederal anti-discrimination statute has been violated, and of the\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  21.  In Frontiero,  a plurality  of the Court  concluded that\r                             \r\n  gender-based  classifications,  \"like  classifications  based\r\n  upon  race,  alienage,  or  national origin,  are  inherently\r\n  suspect, and  must therefore be subjected  to strict judicial\r\n  scrutiny.\"  411 U.S. at 688.  In the 23 years that have since\r\n  elapsed, this  position has never commanded a majority of the\r\n  Court,  and has never been  adopted by this  court.  Whatever\r\n  may be the merits of adopting strict scrutiny as the standard\r\n  to  be  applied   to  gender-based  classifications,   it  is\r\n  inappropriate  to  suggest,  as  Brown does,  that  Frontiero\r                                                                         \r\n  compels its application here.  \r\n             Brown's  assertion  that  Adarand  obligates  this\r                                                        \r\n  court to apply Croson  to its equal protection claim  is also\r                                 \r\n  incorrect.   As  noted previously,  Croson is  an affirmative\r                                                      \r\n  action  case and  does  not  control  review  of  a  judicial\r\n  determination that a federal anti-discrimination  statute has\r\n  been  violated.  To the extent that Brown assumes that Croson\r                                                                         \r\n  governs the issue of the sufficiency of the factual predicate\r\n  required  to uphold  a  federally mandated,  benign race-  or\r\n  gender-based   classification,   that   assumption  is   also\r\n  unfounded.   As we have explained,  Croson's factual concerns\r                                                      \r\n  are  not  raised  by  a  district  court's  determination  --\r\n  predicated  upon  duly adjudicated  factual  findings bearing\r\n  multiple indicia of reliability  and specificity -- of gender\r\n  discrimination in  violation of a  federal statute.   We also\r\n  point  out that  Adarand did  not reach  the question  of the\r                                    \r\n  sufficiency  of the  factual  predicate  required to  satisfy\r\n  strict scrutiny  review of a  congressionally mandated  race-\r\n  based classification.  \r\n\n                               -64-\r                                         -64-\r\r\n\nstatutory  and  constitutional propriety  of the  judicial remedy\r\n\nordered to provide  redress to plaintiffs with standing  who have\r\n\nbeen injured by the violation. \r\n\n            Second,   Adarand  does   not  even   discuss  gender\r                                       \r\n\ndiscrimination, and  its holding  is limited to  explicitly race-\r\n\nbased classifications.  --- U.S. at ---, 115  S. Ct. at 2113.  It\r\n\ncan  hardly be assumed that the Court intended to include gender-\r                                \r\n\nbased classifications within  Adarand's precedential scope or  to\r                                               \r\n\nelevate, sub silentio, the level  of scrutiny to be applied by  a\r                               \r\n\nreviewing court to such classifications.\r\n\n            Third, even if Adarand did apply, it does not dictate\r                                            \r\n\nthe  level of  scrutiny  to be  applied  in this  case, as  Brown\r\n\nconcedes.    For the  last twenty  years,  the Supreme  Court has\r\n\napplied  intermediate   scrutiny  to  all  cases   raising  equal\r\n\nprotection challenges to gender-based  classifications, including\r\n\nthe  Supreme  Court's  most  recent  gender discrimination  case,\r\n\nUnited States v.

E.g., Hogan, 458 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n724.  Applying that test,  it is clear that the  district court's\r\n\nremedial order passes constitutional muster. \r\n\n            We find that the first part of the test is satisfied.\r\n\nThe  governmental objectives  of \"avoid[ing]  the use  of federal\r\n\nresources to support  discriminatory practices,\" and \"provid[ing]\r\n\nindividual   citizens   effective   protection    against   those\r\n\npractices,\"  Cannon,  441  U.S.  at 704,  are  clearly  important\r                             \r\n\nobjectives.   We also find  that judicial enforcement  of federal\r\n\nanti-discrimination   statutes   is   at   least   an   important\r\n\ngovernmental objective. \r\n\n            Applying  the   second  prong  of   the  intermediate\r\n\nscrutiny  test, we find that  the means employed  by the district\r\n\ncourt  in  fashioning  relief  for the  statutory  violation  are\r\n\nclearly  substantially  related  to these  important  objectives.\r\n\nIntermediate scrutiny does not require that there be no other way\r\n\nto accomplish the objectives, but even if that were the standard,\r\n\nit  would be  satisfied in  the unique  context presented  by the\r\n\napplication of Title IX to athletics.  \r\n\n            As explained  previously, Title  IX as it  applies to\r\n\nathletics is  distinct from other anti-discrimination  regimes in\r\n\nthat  it is  impossible to  determine compliance  or to  devise a\r\n\nremedy  without counting and  comparing opportunities with gender\r\n\nexplicitly in mind.   Even under the individual rights  theory of\r\n\nequal  protection, reaffirmed in Adarand, --- U.S. at ---, 115 S.\r                                                  \r\n\n                               -67-\r                                         -67-\r\r\n\nCt. at 2112 (the  equal protection guarantee \"protect[s] persons,\r\n\nnot groups\"),  the only way to determine whether the rights of an\r\n\nindividual  athlete  have  been   violated  and  what  relief  is\r\n\nnecessary to remedy the  violation is to engage in  an explicitly\r\n\ngender-conscious comparison.  Accordingly, even assuming that the\r\n\nthree-part  test  creates  a gender  classification  that  favors\r\n\nwomen, allowing consideration of gender in determining the remedy\r\n\nfor  a  Title  IX  violation serves  the  important  objective of\r\n\n\"ensur[ing]   that   in    instances   where   overall   athletic\r\n\nopportunities decrease, the actual opportunities available to the\r\n\nunderrepresented gender  do not.\"   Kelley, 35  F.3d at 272.   In\r                                                    \r\n\naddition, a gender-conscious  remedial scheme is constitutionally\r\n\npermissible  if  it  directly   protects  the  interests  of  the\r\n\ndisproportionately burdened gender.   See Hogan, 458  U.S. at 728\r                                                         \r\n\n(\"In   limited   circumstances,  a   gender-based  classification\r\n\nfavoring  one  sex can  be  justified  if  it  intentionally  and\r\n\ndirectly assists  members of  the sex that  is disproportionately\r\n\nburdened.\").\r\n\n            Under  Brown's interpretation of the three-part test,\r\n\nthere can never be a  remedy for a violation of Title  IX's equal\r\n\nopportunity  mandate.   In concluding  that the  district court's\r\n\ninterpretation and  application of the three-part  test creates a\r\n\nquota,  Brown errs, in part,  because it fails  to recognize that\r\n\n(i) the substantial proportionality test of prong one is only the\r\n\nstarting point, and not the conclusion, of the analysis; and (ii)\r\n\n                               -68-\r                                         -68-\r\r\n\nprong  three is  not implicated  unless a  gender-based disparity\r\n\nwith  respect to athletics  participation opportunities  has been\r\n\nshown to exist.  Where such a disparity has been established, the\r\n\ninquiry under prong three is whether the athletics interests  and\r\n\nabilities   of  the   underrepresented  gender   are   fully  and\r\n\neffectively accommodated, such that  the institution may be found\r\n\nto comply with Title IX, notwithstanding the disparity.23  \r\n\n            Of course,  a remedy that requires  an institution to\r\n\ncut, add, or elevate the  status of athletes or entire teams  may\r\n\nimpact the genders differently, but this will be so only if there\r\n\nis   a   gender-based  disparity   with   respect  to   athletics\r\n\nopportunities to  begin with, which  is the only  circumstance in\r\n\nwhich  prong three  comes into play.   Here, however,  it has not\r\n\nbeen shown that Brown's men students will be disadvantaged by the\r\n\nfull and  effective accommodation of the  athletics interests and\r\n\nabilities of its women students.\r\n\n                               VI.\r                                         VI.\r\n\n            Brown assigns error to the district court's exclusion\r\n\nof  certain  evidence  pertaining   to  the  relative   athletics\r\n\ninterests of  men  and women.

Under  the three-part  test,  the institution  may  also\r\n  excuse the disparity under prong  two, by showing a  \"history\r\n  and   continuing  practice  of  program  expansion  which  is\r\n  demonstrably  responsive  to   the  developing  interest  and\r\n  abilities of the [underrepresented  gender],\" 44 Fed.

I  recognize  the  financial\r\n            constraints Brown faces; however, its own\r\n            priorities will necessarily determine the\r\n            path to compliance it elects to take.\r\n\nCohen III, 879 F. Supp.  at 214; see also  Cohen II, 991 F.2d  at\r                                                             \r\n\n898  n.15 (noting that a school may achieve compliance with Title\r\n\nIX by \"reducing opportunities for the overrepresented gender\").\r\n\n            With  these precepts  in mind,  we first  examine the\r\n\ncompliance plan Brown submitted to the district court in response\r\n\nto  its order.    We then  consider  the district  court's  order\r\n\nrejecting  Brown's plan  and the  specific relief ordered  by the\r\n\ncourt in its place.\r\n\n            Brown's proposed  compliance plan stated its  goal as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n                               -72-\r                                         -72-\r\r\n\n            The  plan  has one  goal:    to make  the\r\n            gender   ratio  among   University-funded\r\n            teams     at      Brown     substantially\r\n            proportionate  to the gender ratio of the\r\n            undergraduate  student body.   To  do so,\r\n            the   University   must   disregard   the\r\n            expressed   athletic  interests   of  one\r\n            gender  while  providing  advantages  for\r\n            others.     The  plan   focuses  only  on\r                                                               \r\n            University-funded  sports,  ignoring  the\r                                                               \r\n            long  history of  successful donor-funded\r                                                               \r\n            student teams.\r                                   \r\n\nBrown's Plan at 1 (emphasis added).\r\n\n            In its introduction, Brown makes clear that it \"would\r\n\nprefer  to  maintain  its  current program\"  and  that  the  plan\r\n\nsubmitted\r\n\n            is  inconsistent with  Brown's philosophy\r\n            to the  extent that it  grants advantages\r\n            and  enforces disadvantages  upon student\r\n            athletes solely because  of their  gender\r\n            and curbs the historic role of coaches in\r\n            determining the number of  athletes which\r\n            can   be   provided  an   opportunity  to\r\n            participate.         Nevertheless,    the\r\n            University  wishes to  act in  good faith\r\n            with    the    order   of    the   Court,\r\n            notwithstanding  issues  of fact  and law\r\n            which are currently in dispute.\r\n\nId. at 2.  \r             \r\n\n            Brown states that it  \"seeks to address the  issue of\r\n\nproportionality  while  minimizing  additional  undue  stress  on\r\n\nalready strained physical and fiscal resources.\"  Id.\r                                                               \r\n\n            The general provisions of  the plan may be summarized\r\n\nas  follows: (i) Maximum squad sizes  for men's teams will be set\r\n\nand enforced.  (ii) Head  coaches of all teams must  field squads\r\n\nthat  meet  minimum  size  requirements.    (iii)  No  additional\r\n\n                               -73-\r                                         -73-\r\r\n\ndiscretionary  funds will be used  for athletics.   (iv) Four new\r\n\nwomen's junior varsity teams -- basketball, lacrosse, soccer, and\r\n\ntennis  --  will  be  university-funded.   (v)  Brown  will  make\r\n\nexplicit a de facto junior varsity team for women's field hockey.\r                             \r\n\nId. at 3-4.  \r             \r\n\n            The   plan   sets   forth    nine   steps   for   its\r\n\nimplementation,  id. at  4-5, and  concludes that  \"if  the Court\r                              \r\n\ndetermines   that  this   plan   is  not   sufficient  to   reach\r\n\nproportionality, phase two will be the elimination of one or more\r\n\nmen's teams,\" id. at 5.\r                           \r\n\n            The district court found  Brown's plan to be \"fatally\r\n\nflawed\" for two reasons.  First, despite the fact that 76 men and\r\n\n30  women participated  on  donor-funded  varsity teams,  Brown's\r\n\nproposed  plan disregarded  donor-funded varsity  teams. District\r\n\nCourt Order  at 5-6.   Second, Brown's plan  \"artificially boosts\r\n\nwomen's  varsity numbers  by adding  junior varsity  positions on\r\n\nfour women's teams.\"   Id. at 6.  As to the  propriety of Brown's\r                                    \r\n\nproposal  to  come  into compliance  by  the  addition  of junior\r\n\nvarsity positions, the district court held:\r\n\n            Positions  on   distinct  junior  varsity\r\n            squads do not qualify as \"intercollegiate\r\n            competition\"   opportunities  under   the\r\n            Policy Interpretation and  should not  be\r\n            included in defendants'  plan.  As  noted\r\n            in   Cohen,   879   F.  Supp.   at   200,\r                                \r\n            \"intercollegiate\"  teams  are those  that\r\n            \"regularly    participate    in   varsity\r\n            competition.\"  See 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,413\r                                        \r\n            n.1.      Junior   varsity   squads,   by\r\n            definition, do not  meet this  criterion.\r\n            Counting   new  women's   junior  varsity\r\n\n                               -74-\r                                         -74-\r\r\n\n            positions  as  equivalent  to men's  full\r\n            varsity positions flagrantly violates the\r\n            spirit  and letter  of Title  IX;   in no\r\n            sense is an  institution providing  equal\r\n            opportunity   if   it   affords   varsity\r\n            positions  to  men  but   junior  varsity\r\n            positions to women.  \r\n\nDistrict Court Order at 6 (footnote omitted).\r\n\n            The district court found that these two flaws  in the\r\n\nproposed plan were sufficient to show that Brown had \"not made  a\r\n\ngood  faith effort to comply with this  Court's mandate.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n8.          In criticizing  another  facet of  Brown's plan,  the\r\n\ndistrict court pointed out that\r\n\n            [a]n institution does  not provide  equal\r\n            opportunity  if it  caps its  men's teams\r\n            after  they  are well-stocked  with high-\r\n            caliber recruits  while requiring women's\r\n            teams to boost numbers by accepting walk-\r\n            ons.   A  university  does not  treat its\r\n            men's and  women's  teams equally  if  it\r\n            allows  the coaches of men's teams to set\r\n            their  own  maximum  capacity limits  but\r\n            overrides  the  judgment  of  coaches  of\r\n            women's teams on the same matter.\r\n\nId. at 8-9.\r             \r\n\n            After rejecting Brown's proposed plan, but bearing in\r\n\nmind Brown's stated objectives,  the district court fashioned its\r\n\nown remedy:\r\n\n            I  have  concluded  that  Brown's  stated\r\n            objectives  will  be  best  served  if  I\r\n            design  a remedy to meet the requirements\r\n            of prong three rather than prong one.  In\r\n            order to bring Brown into compliance with\r\n            prong one under  defendants' Phase II,  I\r\n            would have  to order Brown  to cut enough\r\n            men's  teams  to eradicate  approximately\r\n            213  men's  varsity   positions.     This\r\n            extreme  action is  entirely unnecessary.\r\n\n                               -75-\r                                         -75-\r\r\n\n            The easy answer lies in ordering Brown to\r\n            comply with prong  three by upgrading the\r\n            women's gymnastics,  fencing, skiing, and\r\n            water  polo  teams  to  university-funded\r\n            varsity status.  In this way, Brown could\r\n            easily achieve prong three's  standard of\r\n            \"full and effective accommodation  of the\r\n            underrepresented sex.\"  This remedy would\r\n            entail   upgrading   the   positions   of\r\n            approximately  40  women.  In   order  to\r\n            finance   the   40   additional   women's\r\n            positions, Brown certainly will  not have\r\n            to  eliminate as  many as  the 213  men's\r\n            positions that would be cut under Brown's\r\n            Phase  II  proposal.    Thus,  Brown will\r\n            fully comply with Title IX by meeting the\r\n            standards   of   prong   three,   without\r\n            approaching satisfaction of the standards\r\n            of prong one.  \r\n\n            It is  clearly in  the  best interest  of\r\n            both the male and the  female athletes to\r\n            have an increase in women's opportunities\r\n            and   a   small    decrease   in    men's\r\n            opportunities, if necessary, rather than,\r\n            as  under Brown's  plan,  no increase  in\r                                                  \r\n            women's   opportunities   and   a   large\r                                                               \r\n            decrease    in    men's    opportunities.\r\n            Expanding women's  athletic opportunities\r\n            in  areas where  there is  proven ability\r\n            and interest is the very purpose of Title\r\n            IX  and  the simplest,  least disruptive,\r\n            route to Title IX compliance at Brown.\r\n\nId. at 11-12.\r             \r\n\n            The  district  court  ordered Brown  to  \"elevate and\r\n\nmaintain women's gymnastics, women's  water polo, women's skiing,\r\n\nand women's fencing to university-funded varsity status.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n12.   The court stayed this part  of the order pending appeal and\r\n\nfurther ordered that, in  the interim, the preliminary injunction\r\n\nprohibiting  Brown  from  eliminating  or  demoting  any existing\r\n\nwomen's varsity team would remain in effect.  Id.\r                                                           \r\n\n                               -76-\r                                         -76-\r\r\n\n            We  agree  with  the  district   court  that  Brown's\r\n\nproposed  plan fell  short of  a good  faith  effort to  meet the\r\n\nrequirements of Title IX as explicated  by this court in Cohen II\r                                                                           \r\n\nand as applied by the district court on remand.  Indeed, the plan\r\n\nis replete with argumentative  statements more appropriate for an\r\n\nappellate brief.  It  is obvious that Brown's plan  was addressed\r\n\nto this court,  rather than to offering a  workable solution to a\r\n\ndifficult problem.\r\n\n            It  is clear, nevertheless,  that Brown's proposal to\r\n\ncut men's teams is a permissible means of effectuating compliance\r\n\nwith  the statute.   Thus,  although  we understand  the district\r\n\ncourt's reasons  for substituting  its own specific  relief under\r\n\nthe circumstances at the time, and although the district  court's\r\n\nremedy  is within  the statutory  margins and  constitutional, we\r\n\nthink that  the district court  was wrong  to reject  out-of-hand\r\n\nBrown's alternative plan  to reduce the  number of men's  varsity\r\n\nteams.  After all,  the district court itself stated that  one of\r\n\nthe  compliance options available to  Brown under Title  IX is to\r\n\n\"demote or  eliminate the  requisite number of  men's positions.\"\r\n\nCohen III, 879 F. Supp. at 214.  Our respect for academic freedom\r                   \r\n\nand  reluctance  to  interject  ourselves  into  the  conduct  of\r\n\nuniversity  affairs counsels  that we  give universities  as much\r\n\nfreedom as possible in conducting their operations consonant with\r\n\nconstitutional  and statutory limits.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 906;\r                                                         \r\n\nVillanueva, 930 F.2d at 129.\r                    \r\n\n                               -77-\r                                         -77-\r\r\n\n            Brown therefore should be afforded the opportunity to\r\n\nsubmit another plan for compliance with Title IX.  The context of\r\n\nthe  case has  changed in  two significant  respects since  Brown\r\n\npresented its original plan.  First, the substantive issues  have\r\n\nbeen decided adversely to Brown.  Brown is no longer an appellant\r\n\nseeking a favorable result in the Court  of Appeals.  Second, the\r\n\ndistrict  court is not under  time constraints to  consider a new\r\n\nplan and fashion a remedy so as to expedite appeal.  Accordingly,\r\n\nwe remand the case to the district court so that Brown can submit\r\n\na  further plan for its consideration.  In all other respects the\r\n\njudgment  of the  district court  is  affirmed.   The preliminary\r\n\ninjunction issued by the district court in Cohen I,  809 F. Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\nat 1001, will remain in effect pending a final remedial order.\r\n\n                              VIII.\r                                        VIII.\r\n\n            There can be no  doubt that Title IX has  changed the\r\n\nface of women's sports as well  as our society's interest in  and\r\n\nattitude  toward women athletes  and women's sports.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nFrank DeFord, The Women  of Atlanta, Newsweek, June 10,  1996, at\r                                             \r\n\n62-71; Tharp, supra,  at 33;  Robert Kuttner,  Vicious Circle  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nExclusion,  Washington  Post, September  4,  1996,  at  A15.   In\r                   \r\n\naddition,  there  is  ample  evidence  that  increased  athletics\r\n\nparticipation opportunities for women and  young girls, available\r\n\nas a result of Title IX enforcement, have had salutary effects in\r\n\nother areas of societal concern.  See DeFord, supra, at 66. \r                                                             \r\n\n                               -78-\r                                         -78-\r\r\n\n            One  need  look   no  further  than  the   impressive\r\n\nperformances  of our country's women athletes in the 1996 Olympic\r\n\nSummer Games to see that Title IX has had a dramatic and positive\r\n\nimpact on the capabilities of our women athletes, particularly in\r\n\nteam sports.  These Olympians represent the first full generation\r\n\nof  women  to  grow  up  under  the  aegis  of  Title  IX.    The\r\n\nunprecedented  success  of these  athletes  is due,  in  no small\r\n\nmeasure, to Title IX's beneficent  effects on women's sports,  as\r\n\nthe athletes themselves have  acknowledged time and again.   What\r\n\nstimulated  this  remarkable change  in  the  quality of  women's\r\n\nathletic  competition  was not  a  sudden,  anomalous upsurge  in\r\n\nwomen's interest  in sports,  but the  enforcement of  Title IX's\r\n\nmandate of gender equity in sports.

Second, Califano, unlike the instant case, contained an\r                                  \r\n  \"exceedingly  persuasive  justification\"   for  its   gender-\r\n  conscious state action.\r\n\n                               -85-\r                                         -85-\r\r\n\nclassification  serves important governmental objectives and that\r\n\nthe  discriminatory means employed  are substantially  related to\r\n\nthe  achievement of  those objectives.\"   Id.  at 2275  (internal\r                                                       \r\n\nquotations  omitted)  (emphasis  added).    Being  \"substantially\r\n\nrelated  to  an  important government  objective,\"  therefore, is\r\n\nconsidered  a necessary but not sufficient  condition.

BROWN'S EQUAL PROTECTION CHALLENGE\r\n\n          Appellees have  argued that  the three-prong test  does\r\n\nnot  create a  gender classification  because the  classification\r\n\napplies to  both women and  men.

Prong One\r                      1. Prong One\r\n\n          A central issue  in this  case is the  manner in  which\r\n\nathletic  \"participation opportunities\" are  counted.  During the\r\n\n1990-91  academic year,  Brown fielded  16 men s  and  15 women s\r\n\nvarsity teams on  which 566 men and  328 women participated.   By\r\n\nthe 1993-94 year, there were 12 university-funded men s teams and\r\n\n13 university funded women s teams.  These teams included 479 men\r\n\nand 312 women.   Based  on an analysis  of membership in  varsity\r\n\nteams,  the  district  court   concluded  that  there  existed  a\r\n\n                               -90-\r                                         -90-\r\r\n\ndisparity   between   female  participation   in  intercollegiate\r\n\nathletics and female student enrollment.\r\n\n          Even assuming that membership numbers in varsity sports\r\n\nis a  reasonable proxy for participation opportunities  -- a view\r\n\nwith which I do not concur -- contact sports should be eliminated\r\n\nfrom  the  calculus.   The regulation  at  34 C.F.R.    106.41(b)\r\n\n(1995) provides that an academic institution may operate separate\r\n\nteams  for members of each sex \"where  selection of such teams is\r\n\nbased  upon  competitive  skill or  the  activity  involved  is a\r\n\ncontact sport.\"  34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).  When a team is sponsored\r\n\nonly  for one sex, however, and where \"athletic opportunities for\r\n\nmembers  of that sex have previously been limited, members of the\r\n\nexcluded  sex must  be allowed  to try-out  for the  team offered\r\n\nunless  the sport  involved is  a contact  sport,\" id.  (emphasis\r                                                                \r\n\nadded).   The  regulation, therefore,  allows schools  to operate\r\n\nsingle-sex  teams  in contact  sports.  In counting participation\r\n\nopportunities,  therefore, it does  not make sense  to include in\r\n\nthe  calculus  athletes  participating  in  contact  sports  that\r\n\ninclude only men s teams.   For example, if a  university chooses\r\n\nto  sponsor a football  team, it is  permitted to  sponsor only a\r\n\nmen s team.   Not  all sports  are  the same  and the  university\r\n\nshould be given the flexibility to determine which activities are\r\n\nmost  beneficial  to  its student  body.    By  including in  its\r\n\naccounting a  contact sport that  requires very large  numbers of\r\n\nparticipants, e.g., football, the district court skews the number\r\n\n                               -91-\r                                         -91-\r\r\n\nof  athletic  participants  --   making  it  impossible  for  the\r\n\nuniversity to  provide  both men's  and  women's teams  in  other\r\n\nsports.\r\n\n          If  the  athletes competing  in  sports  for which  the\r\n\nuniversity is  permitted to  field single-sex teams  are excluded\r\n\nfrom the  calculation of  participation rates, the  proportion of\r\n\nwomen  participants would  increase  dramatically  and prong  one\r\n\nmight be  satisfied.  If so, the inquiry ends and Brown should be\r\n\njudged to be in compliance.\r\n\n            2. Prong Two\r                      2. Prong Two\r\n\n          The  district court concluded, and the majority appears\r\n\nto  agree, that Brown failed to satisfy prong two because \"merely\r\n\nreducing program offerings to the overrepresented gender does not\r\n\nconstitute  program expansion  for the  underrepresented gender.\"\r\n\nMajority Opinion at  18.  This  is a curious  result because  the\r\n\nentire three-prong test is based on relative participation rates.\r                                                      \r\n\nProng one, for example, requires that participation opportunities\r\n\nbe provided  proportionately to enrollment, but  does not mandate\r\n\nany absolute number of such opportunities.   The district court s\r\n\nconclusion with  respect to  prong two, however,  implies that  a\r\n\nschool  must not only demonstrate that the proportion of women in\r\n\ntheir program  is growing over time,  it must also show  that the\r\n\nabsolute number of women participating is increasing.26\r                  \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  26.  This  requirement presents  a  dilemma for  a school  in\r\n  which  women  are  less  interested in  athletics,  as  Brown\r\n  contends is the case.  Under such conditions, a school may be\r\n\n                               -92-\r                                         -92-\r\r\n\n          Under  the  district court's  interpretation,  a school\r\n\nfacing  budgetary constraints must, in order to comply with prong\r\n\ntwo, increase the opportunities available to the underrepresented\r                       \r\n\ngender,  even  if  it  cannot  afford  to  do  so.   Rather  than\r\n\nrespecting  the school s  right to  determine the  role athletics\r\n\nwill  play in the future --  including reducing the opportunities\r\n\navailable  to   the  formerly  overrepresented  gender to  ensure\r\n\nproportionate  opportunities  --  the  district   court  and  the\r\n\nmajority  demand  that  the  absolute  number   of  opportunities\r                                               \r\n\nprovided to the underrepresented  gender be increased.  I  see no\r\n\npossible  justification for this interpretation -- the regulation\r\n\nis  intended to  protect against  discrimination, not  to promote\r\n\nathletics  on  college campuses.   A  school  is not  required to\r\n\nsponsor an  athletic program of any  particular size.  It  is not\r\n\nfor the courts, or  the legislature, for that matter,  to mandate\r\n\nprograms of a given  size.  The most that can be demanded is that\r\n\nathletics be provided in a non-discriminatory manner.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  the  claim   that  a  reduction   in  the\r\n\nopportunities  given   to  the   overrepresented  gender  is   an\r\n\nunacceptable  method of  coming  into compliance  with the  three\r\n\nprong test  is contrary  to both  Cohen  II and  comments of  the\r                                                     \r\n\nmajority opinion.  The majority quotes approvingly from Cohen  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBrown  Univ.,  879 F.

This  conclusion is\r                                                    \r\n\nconsistent  with Cohen II, which states that a school may achieve\r                                   \r\n\ncompliance  by  reducing  opportunities for  the  overrepresented\r\n\ngender.  See Cohen II,  991 F.2d at 898 n.15.  I fail  to see how\r                               \r\n\nthese  statements can  be reconciled  with  the claim  that Brown\r\n\ncannot satisfy prong two by  reducing the number of participation\r\n\nopportunities for men.\r\n\n            3. Prong Three\r                      3. Prong Three\r\n\n          Prong three of the  three-prong test states that, where\r\n\nan institution does not comply with prongs one or two, compliance\r\n\nwill be assessed on the basis of\r\n\n            whether it  can be demonstrated  that the\r\n            interests and abilities of the members of\r\n            th[e]  [proportionately underrepresented]\r\n            sex  have  been  fully   and  effectively\r\n            accommodated by the present program.\r\n\n44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,418 (December 11, 1979).\r\n\n          According  to the  district  court,  Brown's  athletics\r\n\nprogram   violates   prong   three   because   members   of   the\r\n\nproportionately underrepresented sex  have demonstrated  interest\r\n\nsufficient for a  university-funded varsity team  that is not  in\r\n\n                               -94-\r                                         -94-\r\r\n\nfact being funded.  The district court asserts that this is not a\r\n\nquota.   Brown, on  the other  hand, argues that  prong three  is\r\n\nsatisfied  when (1) the interests and abilities of members of the\r\n\nproportionately underrepresented gender  (2) are accommodated  to\r\n\nthe same degree as the proportionately overrepresented gender.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  narrow, literal  interpretation\r\n\nshould  be  rejected  because  prong  three  cannot  be  read  in\r\n\nisolation.   First,  as Brown  points  out, the  Regulation  that\r\n\nincludes prong three provides that, in assessing compliance under\r\n\nthe regulation, \"the governing principle in this area is that the\r\n\nathletic interests and  abilities of male and female  students be\r                                                                           \r\n\nequally  effectively accommodated.\"    Policy Interpretation,  44\r                                                                      \r\n\nFed.  Reg. 71,413, 71,414.  Thus, Brown contends, to meet \"fully\"\r\n\n-- in  an absolute  sense --  the interests  and abilities  of an\r\n\nunderrepresented   gender,  while   unmet   interest  among   the\r\n\noverrepresented  gender continues, would contravene the governing\r\n\nprinciple of \"equally effective accommodat[ion]\" of the interests\r\n\nand abilities of students of both genders.\r\n\n          It  is   also  worthwhile  to  note   that  to  \"fully\"\r\n\naccommodate the  interests and abilities of  the underrepresented\r\n\nsex  is  an extraordinarily  high  --  perhaps impossibly  so  --\r\n\nrequirement.   How could an academic institution with a large and\r\n\ndiverse  student  body  ever  \"fully\"  accommodate  the  athletic\r\n\ninterests  of its  students?   Under  even  the largest  athletic\r\n\nprogram,  it would  be surprising  to find  that there  is not  a\r\n\n                               -95-\r                                         -95-\r\r\n\nsingle student who would  prefer to participate in  athletics but\r\n\ndoes not do so because the school does not offer a program in the\r\n\nparticular sport that interests the student.  To read fully in an\r\n\nabsolute sense would make the third prong virtually impossible to\r\n\nsatisfy and, therefore, an irrelevant addition to the test.\r\n\n          This  difficulty  was  recognized in  Cohen  II,  which\r                                                                   \r\n\nstated  that \"the mere fact  that there are  some female students\r\n\ninterested  in a sport does not ipso  facto require the school to\r                                                     \r\n\nprovide  a varsity  team  in  order  to  comply  with  the  third\r\n\nbenchmark.\"  Cohen II 991 F.2d at 898.  The balance that Cohen II\r                                                                           \r\n\nadvocates  would require the institution to ensure \"participatory\r\n\nopportunities  . .  .  when, and  to  the extent  that, there  is\r\n\nsufficient interest and ability among the members of the excluded\r\n\nsex to sustain a viable team.\"  Id. (internal citations omitted).\r                                             \r\n\nThis standard  may be practical  for certain sports  that require\r\n\nlarge  teams, but what of  individual sports?   A \"viable\" tennis\r\n\nteam may require only a single player.  The same could be said of\r\n\nany individual  sport, including golf, track  and field, cycling,\r\n\nfencing,  archery, and  so  on.   Therefore,  we still  have  the\r\n\nproblem  that  to  \"fully   accommodate\"  the  interests  of  the\r\n\nunderrepresented sex may be impossible under the district court's\r\n\ninterpretation.\r\n\n          In light of the above, Brown argues that prong three is\r\n\nin  fact ambiguous with respect  to whether \"fully\"  means (1) an\r\n\ninstitution must meet 100% of the underrepresented gender's unmet\r\n\n                               -96-\r                                         -96-\r\r\n\nreasonable interest and ability, or (2)  an institution must meet\r\n\nthe  underrepresented  gender's  unmet  reasonable  interest  and\r\n\nability as fully as it meets those of the overrepresented gender.\r\n\nI  agree  with  Brown  that,  in  the  context  of  OCR's  Policy\r\n\nInterpretation, prong three is susceptible  to at least these two\r\n\nplausible interpretations.    \r\n\n          Additionally, section 1681(a),  a provision enacted  by\r\n\nCongress as part of  Title IX itself, casts doubt on the district\r\n\ncourt's reading of prong three.   20 U.S.C.   1681(a) (1988).  As\r\n\nBrown points out, Title IX, of which the Policy Interpretation is\r\n\nan   administrative   interpretation,   contains  language   that\r\n\nprohibits the ordering of preferential  treatment on the basis of\r\n\ngender due  to a failure of a program to substantially mirror the\r\n\ngender ratio  of an institution.   Specifically, with  respect to\r\n\nTitle  IX's guarantee  that no  person shall  be excluded  on the\r\n\nbasis  of sex from \"participation  in, denied the  benefits of or\r\n\nsubjected  to  discrimination  under  any  education  program  or\r\n\nactivity receiving  Federal financial  assistance,\"  20 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1681(a),\r\n\n            [n]othing  contained  [therein] shall  be\r\n            interpreted  to  require any  educational\r\n            institution  to   grant  preferential  or\r\n            disparate treatment to the members of one\r\n            sex on account of an  imbalance which may\r\n            exist with respect to the total number or\r\n            percentage   of   persons   of  the   sex\r\n            participating   in   or   receiving   the\r\n            benefits   of  any   federally  supported\r\n            program or activity,  in comparison  with\r\n            the total number or percentage of persons\r\n            of that sex in any community.\r\n\n                               -97-\r                                         -97-\r\r\n\nId.   1681(b).   Section 1681(b) provides yet another  reason why\r             \r\n\nthe  district court's reading  of prong three  is troublesome and\r\n\nwhy Brown's reading is a reasonable alternative.\r\n\n          Since  the applicable  regulation, 34 C.F.R.    106.41,\r\n\nand  policy   interpretation,  44  Fed.  Reg.   71,418,  are  not\r\n\nmanifestly  contrary to the objectives of  Title IX, and Congress\r\n\nhas  specifically delegated  to an  agency the  responsibility to\r\n\narticulate standards governing a  particular area, we must accord\r\n\nthe  ensuing regulation considerable  deference.

First,  the  district court's  interpretation creates  a\r\n\nquota  scheme.   Second,  even assuming  such  a quota  scheme is\r\n\notherwise  constitutional,  appellees  have  not  pointed  to  an\r\n\n\"exceedingly  persuasive justification,\" see  Virginia, 116 S.Ct.\r                                                                \r\n\nat 2274, for this particular quota scheme.\r\n\n                               -98-\r                                         -98-\r\r\n\n            1. The Quota\r                      1. The Quota\r\n\n          I  believe that the  three prong test,  as the district\r\n\ncourt interprets  it, is a  quota.   I am in  square disagreement\r\n\nwith the majority, who believe that \"[n]o aspect of the  Title IX\r\n\nregime  at issue  in  this  case  .  .  .  mandates  gender-based\r\n\npreferences or quotas.\"   Majority  Opinion at 29.   Put  another\r\n\nway,  I agree  that  \"Title  IX  is  not  an  affirmative  action\r\n\nstatute,\"  id., but I believe  that is exactly  what the district\r                        \r\n\ncourt has made of it.   As interpreted by the district court, the\r\n\ntest constitutes an affirmative action, quota-based scheme.\r\n\n          I  am less interested  in the actual  term \"quota\" than\r\n\nthe legally cognizable characteristics that render a quota scheme\r\n\nimpermissible.   And  those characteristics  are present  here in\r\n\nspades.  I  am not persuaded by the majority's  argument that the\r\n\nthree-part test does not  constitute a quota because it  does not\r\n\npermit an agency or court to find a violation solely on the basis\r\n\nof prong one of the test; instead,  an institution must also fail\r\n\nprongs  two and  three.   As Brown  rightly argues,  the district\r\n\ncourt's  application of  the three-prong  test requires  Brown to\r\n\nallocate its athletic resources to meet the as-yet-unmet interest\r\n\nof  a member  of the  underrepresented sex,  women in  this case,\r\n\nwhile   simultaneously  neglecting   any  unmet   interest  among\r\n\nindividuals of the overrepresented  sex.  To the extent  that the\r\n\nrate of interest in  athletics diverges between men and  women at\r\n\nany   institution,  the  district  court's  interpretation  would\r\n\n                               -99-\r                                         -99-\r\r\n\nrequire  that  such  an  institution  treat  an  individual  male\r\n\nstudent's  athletic interest and  an individual  female student's\r\n\nathletic   interest   completely   differently:   one   student's\r\n\nreasonable interest would have  to be met, by law,  while meeting\r                                                           \r\n\nthe other  student's interest  would only  aggravate the  lack of\r\n\nproportionality  giving rise to the  legal duty.   \"The injury in\r\n\ncases  of  this kind  is  that  a 'discriminatory  classification\r\n\nprevent[s] . . . competition on an equal footing.'\"  Adarand, 115\r                                                                      \r\n\nS.

Id.  However, in Kelley, the\r                                                                    \r\n  Seventh Circuit, unlike  the district court, did  not use the\r\n  three-prong test as a definitive test for liability.  Rather,\r\n  the Seventh Circuit endorsed the test as one  for compliance,\r\n  in dismissing  the plaintiff's  claims.  The  Seventh Circuit\r                                          \r\n  did  not consider the question  of whether, had the defendant\r\n\n                              -100-\r                                        -100-\r\r\n\n          The   majority  claims   that   \"neither   the   Policy\r\n\nInterpretation nor  the  district court's  interpretation of  it,\r\n\nmandates statistical  balancing.\"  Majority  Opinion at 41.   The\r                  \r\n\nlogic of this position escapes me.  A school can satisfy the test\r\n\nin  three ways.   The first prong  is met if  the school provides\r\n\nparticipation  opportunities  for  male and  female  students  in\r\n\nnumbers substantially  proportionate to their enrollments.   This\r\n\nprong surely requires statistical balancing.  The second prong is\r\n\nsatisfied if an institution that cannot meet prong one can show a\r\n\n\"continuing practice  of program expansion  which is demonstrably\r\n\nresponsive  to  the  developing  interest and  abilities  of  the\r\n\nmembers  of the underrepresented sex.\"   44 Fed.  Reg. at 71,418.\r\n\nIt can  hardly be  denied  that this  prong requires  statistical\r\n\nbalancing as it is essentially a test that requires the school to\r\n\nshow that  it is moving in the  direction of satisfying the first\r\n\nprong.  Establishing that a school is moving inexorably closer to\r\n\nsatisfying a  requirement that demands  statistical balancing can\r\n\nonly be done by  demonstrating an improvement in the  statistical\r\n\nbalance.    In  other  words,  the  second  prong  also  requires\r\n\nbalancing.  Finally, the third prong, interpreted as the majority\r\n\nadvocates, dispenses  with statistical balancing only  because it\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  University  of  Illinois  not  been in  compliance,  lack  of\r                                         \r\n  compliance  with  the three-prong  test  alone  would trigger\r                                                          \r\n  automatic liability,  nor did  the Seventh Circuit  spell out\r\n  what steps would  have been  required of defendant.   At  any\r\n  rate,  Kelley  pre-dates  the  Supreme  Court's  opinions  in\r                         \r\n  Adarand and Virginia,  meaning that it suffers from  the same\r                                \r\n  defects as Cohen II.\r                               \r\n\n                              -101-\r                                        -101-\r\r\n\nchoose to accord zero weight to one side of the  balance.  Even a\r\n\nsingle  person   with   a  reasonable   unmet  interest   defeats\r\n\ncompliance.    This standard,  in  fact,  goes farther  than  the\r\n\nstraightforward  quota test  of  prong  one.   According  to  the\r\n\ndistrict court,  the unmet interests of  the underrepresented sex\r\n\nmust be completely accommodated before any of the interest of the\r                                                    \r\n\noverrepresented gender can be accommodated.28\r\n\n          A pragmatic  overview of the effect  of the three-prong\r\n\ntest leads me to reject the majority's claim that the three-prong\r\n\ntest  does not  amount to  a quota  because it  involves multiple\r\n\nprongs.  In  my view it  is the result of  the test, and  not the\r\n\nnumber of steps involved, that should determine if a quota system\r\n\nexists.   Regardless  of how  many steps  are involved,  the fact\r\n\nremains  that  the  test  requires   proportionate  participation\r\n\nopportunities for both sexes (prong one) unless one sex is simply\r\n\nnot  interested in participating (prong  three).  It  seems to me\r\n\nthat a quota with an exception for  situations in which there are\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  28.  The  problem  with   the  majority s  argument   can  be\r\n  illustrated  with  a hypothetical  college  admissions policy\r\n  that would require proportionality  between the gender  ratio\r\n  of the  local student  aged population and  that of  admitted\r\n  students.   This  policy is  comparable to  prong one  of the\r\n  three prong test and is, without a doubt, a quota.   It is no\r\n  less  a quota if an exception exists for schools whose gender\r\n  ratio  differs from  that of the  local population  but which\r\n  admit  every applicant  of the  underrepresented gender.   It\r\n  remains a quota because  the school is forced to  admit every\r\n  female  applicant until it  reaches the requisite proportion.\r\n  Similarly, the  district court's interpretation  requires the\r\n  school to  accommodate the interests of  every female student\r\n  until proportionality is reached.\r\n\n                              -102-\r                                        -102-\r\r\n\ninsufficient interested students to  allow the school to  meet it\r\n\nremains  a  quota.    All of  the  negative  effects  of a  quota\r\n\nremain,29 and the school  can escape the quota under  prong three\r\n\nonly  by offering  preferential treatment to  the group  that has\r\n\ndemonstrated less interest in athletics.\r\n\n            2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r                      2. \"Extremely Persuasive Justification\" Test\r\n\n          In view  of the  quota scheme  adopted by the  district\r\n\ncourt, and Congress' specific disavowal of any  intent to require\r\n\nquotas as part of Title  IX, appellees have not met their  burden\r\n\nof  showing an  \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for this\r\n\ngender-conscious exercise of  government authority.   As recently\r\n\nset forth in Virginia, \"[p]arties who seek to defend gender-based\r                               \r\n\ngovernment  action  must demonstrate  an  'exceedingly persuasive\r\n\njustification' for that action.\"  Virginia, 116 S.Ct. at 2274.\r                                                    \r\n\nWhile the Supreme Court in Virginia acknowledged that \"[p]hysical\r                                             \r\n\ndifferences between  men and  women . .  . are enduring,\"  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n2276,  it went on  to state  that such  \"'[i]nherent differences'\r\n\nbetween men and women,  we have come to appreciate,  remain cause\r\n\nfor  celebration, but not for . .  . artificial constraints on an\r\n\nindividual's opportunity.\" Id.\r                                        \r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  29.  Nor  does the  second  prong  of  the  test  change  the\r\n  analysis.  That prong merely recognizes that a school may not\r\n  be able  to  meet the  quotas  of the  first or  third  prong\r\n  immediately,  and  therefore  deems  it  sufficient  to  show\r\n  program  expansion that is responsive to the interests of the\r\n  underrepresented sex.\r\n\n                              -103-\r                                        -103-\r\r\n\n          Neither   appellees   nor  the   district   court  have\r\n\ndemonstrated  an \"exceedingly  persuasive justification\"  for the\r\n\ngovernment action  that the district  court has directed  in this\r\n\ncase.    In  fact,   appellees  have  failed  to  point   to  any\r                                                                           \r\n\ncongressional  statement or  indication  of  intent  regarding  a\r\n\nproportional  representation scheme  as applied  by the  district\r\n\ncourt.   While  they  point to  Congress'  decision  to  delegate\r\n\nauthority to the  relevant agencies,  this does not  amount to  a\r\n\ngenuine  --  that is,  not hypothesized  or  invented in  view of\r\n\nlitigation, id.  at 2275 --  exceedingly persuasive justification\r                         \r\n\nin light of section 1681(b)'s \"no  quota\" provision.  We are left\r\n\nwith  the explanations discussed in  Cohen II to  the effect that\r                                                       \r\n\nCongress  conducted hearings  on  the  subject of  discrimination\r\n\nagainst  women in  education.   There is  little more  than that,\r\n\nbecause Congress  adopted Title IX  as a floor  amendment without\r\n\ncommittee hearings or reports.  See Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 893.\r                                                      \r\n\n          I believe  that the district  court's interpretation of\r\n\nthe  Policy  Interpretation's   three-prong  test  poses  serious\r\n\nconstitutional  difficulties.   \"[W]here an  otherwise acceptable\r\n\nconstruction  of a  statute  would  raise serious  constitutional\r\n\nproblems, [we] construe the statute to avoid such problems unless\r\n\nsuch construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\"\r\n\nEdward J.

Evidentiary Issues\r                               III. Evidentiary Issues\r\n\n          In  disputes  over  the  representation  of   women  in\r\n\nathletic  programs, it  is  inevitable that  statistical evidence\r\n\nwill  be relevant.    There  is simply  no  other  way to  assess\r\n\nparticipation  rates,   interest  levels,  and  abilities.    The\r\n\nmajority  opinion, however,  offers  inconsistent  guidance  with\r\n\nrespect to the role of  statistics in Title IX claims.   Early in\r\n\nthe opinion,  the majority  approvingly cites to  the statistical\r\n\nevaluations conducted  in  Cohen  I, Cohen  II,  and  Cohen  III.\r                                                                          \r\n\nMajority  Opinion at 8-10.   The figures  in question demonstrate\r\n\nthat women s participation in athletics is less than proportional\r\n\nto their enrollment.   Later  in the opinion,  however, when  the\r\n\nlevel  of interest among  women at Brown  is at  issue, the court\r\n\nadopts  a   much  more  critical  attitude   towards  statistical\r\n\nevidence: \"[T]here exists the  danger that, rather than providing\r\n\na  true  measure  of  women s  interest  in  sports,  statistical\r\n\nevidence purporting to reflect women s interest instead  provides\r\n\nonly a  measure of the very  discrimination that is and  has been\r\n\n                              -105-\r                                        -105-\r\r\n\nthe  basis for women s lack of opportunity.\"  Majority Opinion at\r\n\n53.   In other words, evidence of differential levels of interest\r\n\nis not to be credited because it may simply reflect the result of\r\n\npast discrimination.\r\n\n          The  refusal to  accept surveys  of interest  levels as\r\n\nevidence of interest raises the question of what indicators might\r\n\nbe used.  The majority offers no guidance to a  school seeking to\r\n\nassess  the levels  of interest  of its  students.   Although the\r\n\nthree-prong  test, even  as  interpreted by  the district  court,\r\n\nappears to  allow the school  the opportunity to  show a lack  of\r\n\ninterest, the majority rejects the best -- and perhaps the only -\r\n\n- mechanism for making such a showing.\r\n\n          Brown claims that the district court erred in excluding\r\n\nevidence pertaining to the relative athletic interests of men and\r\n\nwomen  at the  university.   Brown sought  to introduce  the NCAA\r\n\nGender Equity Study and  the results of an undergraduate  poll on\r\n\nstudent  interest in athletics, but  was not permitted  to do so.\r\n\nThe majority is unsympathetic to Brown's claim that the disparity\r\n\nbetween  athletic  opportunities  for  men and  women  reflect  a\r\n\ngender-based  difference in  interest  levels.   Indeed,  despite\r\n\nBrown's  attempt to present evidence in support of its claim, the\r\n\nmajority   characterizes   Brown's  argument   as   an  \"unproven\r\n\nassertion.\"  Majority Opinion at 51.30\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  30.  Among  the   evidence  submitted   by  Brown   are:  (i)\r\n  admissions data showing greater athletic interest among  male\r\n  applicants than  female applicants;  (ii) college  board data\r\n\n                              -106-\r                                        -106-\r\r\n\n          Furthermore, the majority recognizes  that institutions\r\n\nare  entitled  to  use  any  nondiscriminatory  method  of  their\r\n\nchoosing to determine athletic interests.  Majority Opinion at 53\r\n\nn.15.  If  statistical evidence of  interest levels is not  to be\r\n\nconsidered by courts,  however, there  is no way  for schools  to\r\n\ndetermine whether they are in compliance.  Any studies or surveys\r\n\nthey might conduct in order to assess their own compliance would,\r\n\nin  the event of litigation, be deemed irrelevant.  Regardless of\r\n\nthe  efforts made by the  academic institution, the  specter of a\r\n\nlawsuit would be ever-present.\r\n\n          In  addition, the majority has put the power to control\r\n\nathletics and the provision of athletic resources in the hands of\r\n\nthe  underrepresented gender.   Virtually  every other  aspect of\r\n\ncollege life is  entrusted to the institution,  but athletics has\r\n\nnow  been carved  out as an  exception and  the university  is no\r\n\nlonger in full  control of its program.   Unless the  two genders\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  showing  greater  athletic interest  and  prior participation\r\n  rates by prospective male  applicants than female applicants;\r\n  (iii)  data  from  the  Cooperative   Institutional  Research\r\n  Program at UCLA  indicating greater  athletic interest  among\r\n  men  than women; (iv) an independent  telephone survey of 500\r\n  randomly  selected  Brown  undergraduates  that  reveals that\r\n  Brown offers  women participation opportunities in  excess of\r\n  their  representation in  the  pool of  interested, qualified\r\n  students; (v)  intramural and  club participation  rates that\r\n  demonstrate  higher participation rates among men than women;\r\n  (vi)  walk-on  and try-out  numbers  that  reflect a  greater\r\n  interest   among  men   than   women;   (vii)   high   school\r\n  participation  rates   that  show   a  much  lower   rate  of\r\n  participation among females than among males; (viii) the NCAA\r\n  Gender Equity  Committee data  showing that women  across the\r\n  country participate in athletics at a lower rate than men.\r\n\n                              -107-\r                                        -107-\r\r\n\nparticipate equally in athletics, members of the underrepresented\r\n\nsex would  have the ability to demand a varsity level team at any\r\n\ntime  if they can show sufficient interest.  Apparently no weight\r\n\nis given  to the sustainability of the  interest, the cost of the\r\n\nsport, the  university s view on  the desirability of  the sport,\r\n\nand so on.\r\n\n                    IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r                              IV. FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE\r\n\n          Finally,  it  is  important  to   remember  that  Brown\r\n\nUniversity  is  a  private  institution  with a  constitutionally\r\n\nprotected  First  Amendment  right  to  choose  its   curriculum.\r\n\nAthletics  are part of that curriculum.  Although the protections\r\n\nof the First Amendment cannot  be used to justify discrimination,\r\n\nthis  court should  not forget that  it has  a duty  to protect a\r\n\nprivate  institution s   right  to  mould  its   own  educational\r\n\nenvironment.\r\n\n          The majority pays  lip service to these concerns in the\r\n\nfinal pages of its long opinion, stating  that \" we are a society\r\n\nthat  cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that universities\r\n\ndeserve great leeway in their operations. \"   Majority Opinion at\r\n\n69  (quoting Cohen II,  991 F.2d at 906),  and \"[o]ur respect for\r                               \r\n\nacademic freedom  and reluctance to interject  ourselves into the\r\n\nconduct of university affairs  counsels that we give universities\r\n\nas  much freedom as possible.\"   Majority Opinion at 75.  Despite\r\n\nthese statements, however, the majority in its opinion today, and\r\n\nthe  district  court   before  it,  have  failed  to  give  Brown\r\n\n                              -108-\r                                        -108-\r\r\n\nUniversity  freedom  to craft  its  own athletic  program  and to\r\n\nchoose  the  priorities of  that  program.    Instead, they  have\r\n\nestablished a  legal rule that  straightjackets college athletics\r\n\nprograms by curtailing  their freedom to  choose the sports  they\r\n\noffer. \r\n\n                              -109-\r                                        -109-\r\r\n</pre>",
