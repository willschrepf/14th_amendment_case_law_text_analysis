Appellant First Bank & Trust East Texas owns a mortgage lien on the\n\nleases, which leases are located in Wood County, Texas.\n\n       The taxing entities originally filed suit in July 2012 naming three different\n\nowners and listing two leases i.e., the Denton White (Tract One) and the I.E.\n\nRobinson (Tract Two), claiming delinquent taxes owed for the years 2009 through\n\n2011, and seeking foreclosure of real and personal property interests. (1 C.R. p.8) 1\n\nAt the time of the filing of the lawsuit, taxing entities, although aware ofHydrogeo's\n\nleasehold ownership, incorrectly sued three entities who did not own any interest in\n\nthe Denton White lease. (2 R.R. p. 57, line 21 - p. 58, line 8.) Taxing entities did\n\nnot sue anyone owning an interest in the Robinson lease for the years 2010 and 2011\n\n(2 R.R. p. 109, line 7 - p. 110, line 18). Even a cursory search of the applicable\n\ncounty clerk's records or their own tax rolls would have revealed the correct owners'\n\nnames. (2 R.R. p. 25 line 20 - p. 26, line 3). It was not until a year later that they\n\nfiled a First Amended Petition naming Hydrogeo, LLC and First Bank & Trust East\n\n\n1\n  References to the Clerk's Record will be by Arabic numeral indicating the volume, the\nabbreviation \"C.R.\" and page number. References to the Reporter's Record will be in the same\nmanner using the abbreviation \"R.R.\" References to the appendix will be with the abbreviation\n\"App.\" and the letter of the referenced appendix tab.\n\n                                              1\n\fTexas for the first time. (1 C.R. p. 36) They filed a second petition naming a 50%\n\nleasehold owner in one of the two leases, DeBerry 3 Operating Company, LLC on\n\nMarch 6, 2014. ( 1 C.R. p. 164) None of appellants received notification of taxing\n\nentities' claimed tax liens prior to filing their First Amended Petition. (2 R.R. p. 56,\n\nlines 17-19). Hydrogeo, LLC has always been current on its ad valorem taxes since\n\nthe time it began operations of the two leases in 2012. (2 R.R. p. 56, lines 13-16).\n\n      As mentioned, Hydrogeo, LLC purchased the two leases in question in 2012,\n\nmeaning they did not own the properties on January 1' 1 of either 2009, 2010 or 2011,\n\nwhich is significant because Hydrogeo alleges they are buyers in ordinary course as\n\ndefined by Tex. Bus. Com. Code §1.201 (b) (9) (Vernon 1987). (2 R.R. p. 55, line\n\n19-p. 56, line 5.) Hydrogeo filed verified denials and obtained response to requests\n\nfor admissions confirming no ownership, lack of prior notice, and questioning the\n\nvalidity of the amount of the lien. (1 C.R. p. 54, 58, 78). As such, Hydrogeo contends\n\nthey effectively rebutted the presumption given to taxing authorities under Tex. Tax\n\nCode Ann. §33.47(a) (Vernon 1992). Additionally, Hydrogeo as a buyer in ordinary\n\ncourse, believe they are protected against enforcement of the taxing authorities' tax\n\nlien as it relates to any personalty located on the two oil and gas leases. (Tex. Tax\n\nCode § 32.03, App. G).\n\n      The enforceability of the tax lien was tried as a bench trial before the court on\n\nSeptember 18, 2014. The taxing entities offered Plaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\", labeled\n\n                                           2\n\f\"Certified Copy of Tax Records'', dated August 22, 2014. (2 R.R. p. 7 line 15-20).\n\nHydrogeo objected to the offer of Exhibit \"A\" for admission. (2 R.R. p. 8, line 1 -\n\nline 7). The objection dealt with the potential violation of TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6, in\n\nthat Exhibit \"A\" had not been provided to Hydrogeo prior to trial. (2 R.R. p. 8 line\n\n20 - p. 9, line 1). Hydrogeo believes the trial court erred by admitting Exhibit \"A\"\n\neven though taxing entities made no showing of good cause or lack of unfair surprise\n\nand/or prejudice. The questionable Exhibit \"A\" was the only evidence offered by\n\ntaxing entities, who then rested. (2 R.R. p. 9, line 10-16). Hydrogeo moved for\n\ndirected verdict, which was overruled. (2 R.R. p. 19, line 15-18 and 2 R.R. p. 22,\n\nline 3).\n\n       Exhibit \"A\" is a seven page document regarding the two leases, and is attached\n\nas Appendix A. Page one describes a 0.83335 royalty interest in the Denton White\n\nlease for the year 2009. (emphasis added). (2 R.R. p. 40, line 9 -p. 41, line 9). The\n\nowners of the leases on Exhibit \"A\" are listed as \"Black Diamond Operating Co.\n\nLLC\" for year 2009 and \"Rheata Resources LLC\" for years 2011 and 2012. (3 C.R.\n\np. 7-9 and App. A). The trial court subsequently ruled that Rheata Resources LLC\n\nnever owned an interest in either of the two oil and gas leases for the years in\n\nquestion and issued a directed verdict confirming its ruling. (2 R.R. p. 109, line 7 -\n\np. 110, line 18, and App. B). Subsequently, evidence at trial revealed the owner and\n\noperator of both leases during all three years in question was \"Steelman Investments,\n\n                                          3\n\fInc.\" (Defendants Black Diamond and Rheata Exhibit Nos. 3 and 5). The taxing\n\nentities have never sued \"Steelman Investments, Inc.\" for collection of the\n\ndelinquent taxes.\n\n      In addition to listing the wrong owners, Plaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\" describes, on\n\npage one, the interest being taxed as a \"royalty interest\". (App. A). Page one of\n\nExhibit \"A\" is taxing entities' sole evidentiary support for its claim for delinquent\n\ntaxes for year 2009 regarding the Denton White lease. (2 R.R. p. 7, line 15 - 20).\n\nSubsequent testimony during trial revealed that taxing entities' claim for taxes on a\n\nroyalty interest was incorrect. (2 R.R. p. 40, line 9 - p. 41, line 9). A royalty interest\n\ncomes from the lessor side of an oil and gas lease, while taxing entities' intended\n\nlien is for a working interest, which comes from the lessee side. (2 R.R. p. 40, line\n\n9, - p. 41, line 9). Despite taxing entities' Exhibit \"A\" listing the wrong owners and\n\ndescribing the wrong interest, the trial court ultimately ruled in favor of taxing\n\nentities on January 14, 2015, granting their request for foreclosure on tax liens on\n\nHydrogeo's two leases. (App. B).\n\n      Hydrogeo requested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on January 21,\n\n2015. (App. C). The trial court issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on\n\nFebruary 4, 2015. (App. D). Hydrogeo objected to the trial court's findings by\n\nrequesting Additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on February 13,\n\n2015, and by listing specific findings and conclusions. (App. E). The trial court\n\n                                            4\n\fdenied Hydrogeo' s requests by re-issuing the same Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law on February 23, 2015. (App. F). Hydrogeo filed its Notice of Appeal on\n\nJanuary 27, 2015. (App. I).\n\n                             SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       Hydrogeo's two leases should be free from the taxing entities' efforts to\n\nforeclose because:\n\n       1)       the one piece of evidence (App. A) was incorrectly admitted by the trial\n\ncourt, in that it had not been provided to opponents prior to trial and good cause was\n\nnot shown by taxing entities to allow admission;\n\n       2)       even if Exhibit \"A\" was properly admitted, it does not prove taxing\n\nentities' claims because it lists the wrong owners, describes the wrong properties,\n\nand does not distinguish between the values given to the leases' personalty from the\n\nvalues given to the realty;\n\n       3)       taxing entities' reliance on its rebuttable presumption is misplaced\n\nbecause Hydrogeo effectively rebutted the presumption, forcing the taxing entities\n\nto prove each element of their cause of action, which they failed to do;\n\n      4)        failure by the taxing entities to prove the valid amount of the underlying\n\ntax claims is critical because without a valid debt, there can be no valid lien on which\n\nto foreclose.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Regarding the evidentiary question, the taxing entities offered one document\n\n(Exhibit \"A\") into the evidence and then rested. (2 R.R. p. 7, line 15 - p. 7, line 20);\n\n(2 R.R. p. 9, line 10 - p. 9, line 16). Exhibit \"A\" constitutes the entire proof offered\n\nby taxing entities. Since Exhibit \"A\" had not been provided to opponents prior to\n\ntrial in direct violation of TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6, the trial court had no discretion to\n\nadmit Exhibit \"A\" unless taxing entities were able to make a showing of good cause\n\nfor not complying with discovery requests. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6 (b). The record\n\nis silent on this issue; no showing was made by the taxing entities. There can be no\n\ndoubt that since Exhibit \"A\" constitutes the entire proof offered by taxing entities,\n\nthat the trial court's decision to improperly admit it constitutes harmful error.\n\n       Even if Exhibit \"A\" was properly admitted, it contains incorrect information\n\nsuch as listing the wrong owners, describing the wrong property and failing to\n\ndistinguish between realty and personalty. (App. A).\n\n      Exhibit \"A\" is a certified copy of the delinquent tax rolls regarding the alleged\n\ntax lien. Under §33.47a of the Tax Code, taxing entities are entitled to a rebuttable\n\npresumption unless Hydrogeo is able to offer sufficient evidence to rebut that\n\npresumption.    Hydrogeo offered verified pleadings, responses to requests for\n\nadmissions, documents and testimony sufficient to rebut the taxing entities'\n\npresumption. Since the burden of going forward with evidence shifted back to them,\n\nthe taxing entities were required to prove their case; they offered no additional proof.\n\n                                           6\n\f       The failure by the taxing entities to prove the valid amount of the underlying\n\ntax claims is critical because without a valid debt, there can be no valid lien on which\n\nto foreclose. A lien is incident to and inseparable from the debt. Since no attempt\n\nwas made by the taxing entities to segregate those taxes assessed for personalty,\n\nthere is no evidence of the valid amount of taxes owed. Thus, there is no evidence\n\nof a valid lien.\n\n       Since taxing entities offered less than a scintilla of admissible evidence\n\nsupporting their underlying tax claim, their alleged lien is also invalid. Thus, the\n\ntrial court's judgment permitting foreclosure ofHydrogeo's property was in error.\n\n\n                       ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n                           ISSUES PRESENTED\n                               ISSUEN0.1\n\n      Did the trial court commit reversible error by admitting Plaintiffs'\nExhibit \"A\" into evidence when the document had not been timely produced\nprior to trial, and when taxing entities failed to show good cause for its failure\nto timely supplement discovery responses.\n\n       Regarding the standard of review for the evidentiary objection presented in\n\nIssue No. 1, the trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion. Interstate Northborough P'ship v. State, 66 S.W.3d 213, 220\n\n(Tex. 2001 ). However, the trial court had no discretion to admit Exhibit \"A\" without\n\ntaxing entities making a showing of good cause. Alvarado v. Farah Mfg. Co., 830\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fS.W.2d 911, 914. Since taxing entities made no effort, and there is no record of\n\ngood cause being shown, the trial court committed error.\n\n      Taxing entities offered Plaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\" to be admitted. (2 R.R. p. 7,\n\nline 15-20). Hydrogeo objected on the grounds that the document being proffered\n\nhad not been provided to Hydrogeo prior to the trial, even though a specific request\n\nfor production had been made. (2 R.R. p. 8, line 1-p. 9, line 8). Specifically, in\n\nrequest for production No. 8, taxing entities were asked to produce, \"each and every\n\ntangible piece of evidence you plan to use at the trial of this cause.\" (2 R.R. p. 8, line\n\n21-23). Taxing entities acknowledged the proposed Exhibit \"A\" had not been\n\nprovided prior to trial but argued that the proposed exhibit was an updated version\n\nofa document produced in year 2013 without offering any evidence of how Exhibit\n\n\"A\" differed from the earlier production. (2 R.R. p 9, line 2 - 4.)\n\n      TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6 (a) states that \"a party who fails to make, amend, or\n\nsupplement a discovery response in a timely manner may not introduce in evidence\n\nthe material or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony of a\n\nwitness other than a named party who was not timely identified unless the court finds\n\nthat: \"l) there was good cause for the failure to timely make, amend or supplement\n\nthe discovery response; or 2) the failure to timely make, amend or supplement the\n\ndiscovery response will not unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties.\"\n\n(App. J).\n\n                                            8\n\f       The burden of proving good cause and/or a lack of unfair prejudice rests on\n\ntaxing entities as the party introducing the evidence. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6 (b).\n\nTaxing entities failed to offer any reason why they did not timely produced the\n\nexhibit in question. (2 R.R. p. 9, line 2-4). The Supreme Court considered this issue\n\nin Alvarado v. Farah Mfg. Co., 830 S.W.2d 911, 914 (Tex. 1992), and held that\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6 is mandatory, and its sole sanction- exclusion of evidence-\n\nis automatic, unless there is good cause to excuse its imposition. The good cause\n\nexception permits a trial court to excuse a failure to comply with discovery in\n\ndifficult or impossible circumstances. The trial court has discretion to determine\n\nwhether the offering party has met his burden of showing good cause to admit the\n\ntestimony; but the trial court has no discretion to admit testimony excluded by the\n\nrule without a showing of good cause. Id. (emphasis added). As the court stated, \"It\n\nis both reasonable and just that a party expect that the rules he has attempted to\n\ncomply with will be enforced equally against his adversary.              To excuse\n\nnoncompliance without a showing of good cause frustrates that expectation.\" Id. at\n\n914.\n\n       Simply put, good cause did not exist for failing to comply with the applicable\n\ndiscovery rules. The trial court erred by admitting the evidence without requiring\n\ntaxing entities to make a showing of good cause. The next question is whether the\n\ntaxing entities proved a showing oflack of unfair surprise or unfair prejudice, TEX.\n\n                                          9\n\fR. CIV. P. 193.6(a). The burden of proving lack of unfair surprise and prejudice is\n\non taxing entities and must be supported by the record. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(b).\n\nThe following quote constitutes taxing entities' entire showing and is recorded at\n\n(2 R.R. p. 8, line 16-19 and p. 9, line 2-4).\n\n      \"Your Honor, we did provide them tax statements. We also gave them the\n\n      calculations for taxes under the Texas Property Tax Code.\n\n      The Court: So this is simply the updated tax rolls?\n\n      Mr. Lambeth: Yes, your Honor.\"\n\n      There is no record of what tax statements, if any, were provided or what\n\ncalculations if any, were ever given to Hydrogeo. In fact, taxing entities point out\n\nthe proposed Exhibit \"A\" is not the same document which might have been provided\n\nback in 2013, and by its nature, could not have been produced back in 2013 since it\n\nis dated in 2014. (2 R.R. p. 8, line 20-p. 9, line 1.) Since the document in question\n\nwas not produced back in 2013, taxing entities' discovery responses necessarily\n\nneeded to be supplemented prior to trial. Clearly it is a different document. As the\n\nrecord indicates, no other explanation is offered by taxing entities.\n\n      Finally, since no showing of good cause, lack of unfair surprise and/or\n\nprejudice is shown, the only remaining question for the Court of Appeals is whether\n\nthe trial court's error is harmful. To obtain reversal for any error arising from an\n\nerroneous admission of evidence, Hydrogeo must show that the error probably\n\n                                           10\n\fresulted in an improper judgment. Good v. Baker, 339 S.W.3d 260, 273 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Texarkana 2011, pet. denied).\n\n      As shown in the record, the only document offered by taxing entities to\n\nsupport their allegations in the entire case is Exhibit \"A\". (2 R.R. p. 9, line 10-16.)\n\nAn alleged certified copy of the tax rolls regarding the property in question allows\n\nthe taxing authorities a rebuttable presumption to establish its prima facia case as to\n\nevery material fact necessary to establish its cause of action. Tex. Tax Code\n\n§33.47(a). In fact, Exhibit \"A\" constitutes taxing entities' entire prima facia case.\n\nSo if this document was improperly admitted, taxing entities produced no evidence\n\nto support any of their allegations. There can be no question therefore that the trial\n\ncourt's error in improperly admitting Exhibit \"A\" constitutes harmful error. Clearly,\n\nthe trial court's judgment should be reversed and rendered.\n\n\n                                       ISSUE NO. 2\n\n      Did the trial court err by holding taxing entities' entire alleged tax lien\nenforceable against Hydrogeo, LLC, and First Bank & Trust East Texas when\ntaxing entities failed to segregate that portion of the lien which was\nunenforceable against Hydrogeo.\n\n      Regarding the standard of review, Hydrogeo objected and excepted to the\n\nfindings of fact of the trial court and asked for further findings consistent with its\n\ntheory of the case. Thus, the court of appeals may review the findings of the trial\n\ncourt and is not bound by the trial court's findings unless such are supported by the\n\n                                          11\n\fevidence in the case. TEX. R. CIV. P. 307; Maro v. State, 168 S.W.2d 510 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.-Amarillo 1943, writ refd). The trial court's conclusions of law are not\n\nbinding on the court of appeals and are reviewed de nova. In re K.R.P., 80 S.W.3d\n\n669, 674 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied).\n\n      In a suit to collect delinquent taxes, the taxing units offering of a certified\n\ncopy of delinquent tax rolls showing the property and the amount of the tax and\n\npenalties imposed and the interest accrued, constitutes prima facia evidence that each\n\nperson charged with a duty relating to the imposition of the tax has complied with\n\nall requirements of law and that the amount of tax alleged to be delinquent against\n\nthe property and the amount of penalties and interest due on that tax as listed are the\n\ncorrect amounts. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.47 (Vernon 1992). This is a rebuttable\n\npresumption. Maximum Medical Improvement, Inc. v. County ofDallas, 272 S.W.3d\n\n832, 836-837 (Tex. Civ. App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.). As this court held, once the\n\npresumption is rebutted, the taxing authorities are required to prove each and every\n\nelement of its cause of action. Id.\n\n      Here, Hydrogeo filed an affirmative defense and verified denial in its First\n\nAmended Answer on August 8, 2013. (1 C.R. p. 54, 58) The only documents offered\n\ninto evidence by taxing entities did not list Hydrogeo as the delinquent tax payer.\n\nPlaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\" (2 R.R. p. 7 line 15-19 and App. A). Additionally, Hydrogeo\n\noffered two request for admission responses in which taxing entities acknowledged\n\n                                          12\n\fnot providing notice to Hydrogeo prior to serving them with the amended petition.\n\n(1 C.R. p. 78). Because these facts were undisputed at trial, no presumption existed\n\nunder Tex. Tax Code Ann.§ 33.47 (Vernon 1992) and taxing entities were required\n\nto prove each and every element of their case. Maximum Medical Improvement, Inc.\n\nv. County of Dallas, 272 S.W.3d 832, 836-837 (Tex. Civ. App.-Dallas 2008, no\n\npet.). Since the trial court did not apply the proper burden of proof, this case should\n\nbe reversed and rendered.\n\n\n         THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE TAXING ENTITIES\n\n      According to Pete Dominguez Enterprises v. County of Dallas, 188 S.W.3d\n\n385 (Tex. Civ. App.-Dallas 2006 no pet.), the evidentiary presumption envisioned\n\nby §33.47(a) is rooted in part on the reliability of taxing authorities' processes and\n\nrecords. (citing DMV Vacuum Services, Inc. v. Zavala County Appraisal District,\n\n812, S.W.2d 435, 437-38 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1991, no writ). However, ifthe\n\nparty named in the certified tax roll is incorrect, the court cannot rely on the accuracy\n\nof the tax records. Id. As stated by Dominguez, \"if the identity of the entity named\n\nas owner of the property on that tax roll does not match the identity of the defendant\n\nsued for non-payment, then no presumption arises and no prima facia case is\n\nestablished by the taxing authority.\" Id. ·\n\n      While Dominguez is an ownership issue case, it is not the only case dealing\n\nwith the sufficiency of the rebuttable presumption referenced in §33.47(a). For\n                                              13\n\finstance, Estates ofElkins v. County ofDallas, 146 S.W.3d 826 (Tex. App.-Dallas\n\n2004, no pet.), states that after the taxing authority makes its prima facia case by\n\nintroducing the tax records required by Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.47(a) (Vernon\n\n1992), the burden then shifts to the taxpayer to show, by introducing competent\n\nevidence, that he has paid the full amount of taxes, penalties and interest, or that\n\nthere is some other defense that applies to his case. (Emphasis added).\n\n      In this case the defense is not misidentification of the party, but rather lack of\n\nownership, failure to prove the amount of taxes due on the underlying debt, failure\n\nto correctly identify the interest on which the lien was claimed and lack of\n\nenforceability of the tax lien. On these issues Hydrogeo offered competent evidence\n\nrebutting the presumption set out in §33.47(a). Once that happened, taxing entities\n\nwere required to establish sufficient evidence to support their alleged claims. As\n\nstated in the Estates of Elkins case, if the taxing authorities' evidence did, in fact,\n\ncreate a legal presumption, that presumption disappeared when the Estates offered\n\nevidence rebutting the taxing authorities' evidence. See also DMV Vacuum Services,\n\nInc. v. Zavala County Appraisal District (explaining the presumption under\n\n§33.47(a)). As the DMV court explains, ifthe taxpayer offers evidence sufficient to\n\njustify a finding against a presumed fact, the presumption disappears as to that\n\nelement of the taxing authorities' cause of action. The taxing authorities' evidence\n\nthen has to stand on its own to prove that particular element. Id.\n\n                                          14\n\f       The Estate of Elkins case did not consider misidentification as the issue, but\n\ninstead considered whether of the full amount of taxes, penalties and interest was\n\ndue, and the court found that the evidence offered by the taxing authorities, (in effect\n\nonly the certified copy of tax rolls), did not constitute more than a mere scintilla of\n\nevidence. Therefore, the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor\n\nof the appellant.\n\n       Another case, Maximum Medical Improvement, Inc. v. County ofDallas, 272\n\nS.W.3d 832, (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.) found that \"when a taxing\n\nauthority's prima facia case is rebutted, the presumption disappears ... \" As in our\n\ncase, the taxpayer filed a verified denial that it was improperly sued, claiming that\n\nanother entity was a proper party. Dallas County attempted, as in this case, to argue\n\nthat the prima facia presumption still applies. The court of appeals disagreed,\n\nreversed the judgment and rendered a take nothing judgment on Dallas County's\n\nclaims.\n\n      Hydrogeo is an oil and gas operator, and the property sought to be foreclosed\n\non by taxing entities is two producing oil and gas leases. As it relates to ad valorem\n\ntaxes, these properties are taxed in at least two different categories: 1) the leasehold\n\nestate itself, which is the oil and gas in the ground, including the legal right to operate\n\nthe well; 2) the actual production equipment, such as casing, tubing, pump jacks,\n\ntanks, and surface pipelines.\n\n                                            15\n\f      According to their Second Amended Petition, at least a portion of taxing\n\nentities' judgment sought was due to taxes on Hydrogeo's personalty. (1 C.R. p.\n\n164). Its petition states that \"the value of any personal property that may be described\n\nabove, and which the tax lien is sought to be enforced, is in excess of FIVE\n\nHUNDRED AND NO 100/ DOLLARS ($500.00)\". Taxing entities clearly seek to\n\nforeclose on a tax lien against both personal and real property.\n\n         As stated in a 1997 Texas Attorney General Opinion, \"irrespective of whether\n\nproduction equipment is real or personal property, it must be appraised separately\n\nfrom its corresponding mineral leasehold interest. Opinion No. DM-438, May 2,\n\n1997. As the opinion also recognizes, the classification of property as real or\n\npersonal is material to such matters as the statute of limitations because the statute\n\ntreats real and personal property differently. Tex. Tax Code Ann.§ 33.05 (Vernon\n\n1992).\n\n         The statute of limitations is not the only issue the legislature uses to treat real\n\nand personal property differently. In our case, Hydrogeo, because of the undisputed\n\nevidence offered at trial, is exempt from having any lien foreclosed on their\n\npersonalty. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 32.03 (Vernon 1992), and Tex. Bus. & Com.\n\nCode Ann. §1.201(b)(9)(Vernon 1987). Since Hydrogeo filed a verified denial\n\ncontesting ownership of the property during the applicable years in question and\n\nquestioning the sufficiency of the lien on the property both real and personal, the\n\n                                             16\n\fburden of proof to plead and prove all of the elements of taxing entities' claim shifted\n\nto them. They offered no evidence distinguishing between the amounts of the lien\n\nclaimed for real property compared to the amount claimed for personalty. Thus,\n\ntaxing entities failed, as a matter of law, to meet their burden of proof.\n\n      Tex. Tax Code Ann §32.03(a) states in part \"[E]xcept as provided by\n\nSubsection (a-1), a tax lien may not be enforced against personal property transferred\n\nto a buyer in ordinary course of business as defined by § 1.201 (9) of the Business\n\nand Commerce Code for value who does not have actual notice of the existence of\n\nthe lien.\" (App. G). The exception listed in Subsection a-1 applies only to\n\nmanufactured homes, and has no application to our case. According to § 1.201 (b)(9),\n\na \"buyer in ordinary course of business\" essentially means a person that buys in good\n\nfaith, without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person. (App.\n\nH). Thus, combining the elements of §32.03(a) and §1.20l(b)(9), Hydrogeo needs\n\nto show they paid value for their personalty, without notice of the lien, in an arm's\n\nlength transaction, and in the normal course of business.\n\n      The undisputed evidence presented at trial is that Hydrogeo was a buyer in\n\nordinary course of business as defined. Bill Godsey testified he had no knowledge\n\nof a previous tax lien. (2 R.R. p. 55, line 11-15). He testified Hydrogeo paid value\n\nfor the leases. (2 R.R. p. 55, line 19-21). He testified Hydrogeo comported with the\n\nusual and customary practices of a buyer in the industry, in an arm's length\n\n                                           17\n\ftransaction. (2 R.R. p. 55, line 22-p. 56, line 5). No effort was made by taxing\n\nentities to rebut this line of testimony.\n\n       Once Hydrogeo established itself as a buyer in the ordinary course of business,\n\nthe taxing entities' claim for a tax lien regarding Hydrogeo's personalty is not\n\nenforceable. (App G.). The next question is whether taxing entities segregated that\n\nportion of its unenforceable lien from the enforceable part. In order to answer this\n\nquestion, the trial court should have determined what portion of the taxes were\n\nassessed for the personalty, compared to that portion assessed for the realty. The\n\npersonalty is that portion of the leases which is not fixed to the realty.\n\n      In determining whether oil and gas equipment is a fixture to real estate, courts\n\nconsider primarily the intention of the party making the annexation. Sonnier v.\n\nChisholm Ryder Co., 909 S.W.2d 475, 479, (Tex. 1995); Logan v. Mullis, 686\n\nS.W.2d, 605, 607-08 (Tex. 1985). In the trial of this case Bill Godsey, president of\n\nHydrogeo, testified he can and will remove any and all production equipment from\n\nthe two leases in question. (2 R.R., p. 62, line 10 - p. 64, line 3.) Loretta Ward,\n\nlandman for Hydrogeo also testified that the equipment can and will be removed. (2\n\nR.R. p. 26, line 7 - p. 26, line 17.) Since the testimony offers undisputed evidence\n\nregarding the intent of the owner of the equipment in question, the only decision\n\nsupported by the evidence is that all of the production equipment on the two oil and\n\ngas leases is personalty. This distinction is important because Hydrogeo as a buyer\n\n                                            18\n\fin ordinary course as defined in Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 32.03 (a) (Vernon 1992), is\n\nexempt from enforcement of any part of the taxing entities' alleged lien against their\n\npersonalty. (Id.)\n\n       Because at least a portion of the lien is unenforceable, it was incumbent on\n\ntaxing entities to prove at trial how much of their alleged lien was due to the\n\npersonalty on the two well locations. This the taxing entities failed to do. (2 R.R.\n\np. 88, line 7- 14.) In fact, the only testimony regarding the value of the personalty\n\nwas provided by Bill Godsey, President ofHydrogeo, (2 R.R. p. 59, line 10 - p. 61,\n\nline 16, and Exhibit HB-9), showing that the value of the personalty actually exceeds\n\nthe total appraised value of the leases.\n\n       Since taxing entities' lien is based on a total value of the taxes due for both\n\nrealty and personalty, and because that portion of the lien for personalty is\n\nunenforceable, and since the value of the personalty exceeds the value of taxing\n\nentities' entire alleged lien, the underlying basis for the alleged lien fails as a matter\n\nof law. The taxing entities' claim of right to foreclose on Hydrogeo's two leases\n\nalso fails.\n\n       Taxing entities must prove the amount of the underlying debt on the real\n\nproperty. A lien is an incident of, and is inseparable from, the debt. Palmer v.\n\nPalmer, 831 S.W.2d 479, 482, (Tex. App.-Texarkana 1992, no writ); citing\n\nUniversity Savings and Loan Ass'n v. Security Lumber Co., 423 S.W.2d 287 (Tex.\n\n                                           19\n\f1967); See also Taylor v. Rigby, 574 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. App.-1978 writ\n\nrefd); As the court stated in Taylor v. Rigby: \"where there is ... a debt secured by\n\na lien, the lien is an incident of and inseparable from the debt. When one sues on the\n\ndebt, the lien is thereby necessarily implicated, and both must be put in issue ... \".\n\nGoldberg v. R.J. Longo Constr. Co., 54 F.3d 243, 246 (5th Cir. 1995); citing Taylor\n\nv. Rigby, 574 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. App. 1978 writ refd).\n\n      In Shipley v. Biscamp, 580 S.W.2d 52, 54 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1979, no writ), the plaintiff failed to prove a current debt to support a lien. The issue\n\nbefore the court was whether there was any debt in existence upon which foreclosure\n\nof the contractual lien could be predicated at the time of trial, since it is fundamental\n\nthat without a debt there can be no lien. Id. The court states \"that the general rule\n\nseems to be universal that a lien is but an accessory to, or mere incident of, the debt\n\nsecured by it, and is discharged and extinguished, ipso facto et eo instante, by\n\npayment of the debt.\" Id. citing Spencer-Sauer Lumber Co. v. Ballard, 98 S.W.2d\n\n1054 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1936, no writ). The court held that it was plaintiffs\n\nburden to prove a debt in existence at the time of trial.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      As shown herein, the one piece of evidence offered by taxing entities was\n\nimproperly admitted because it had not been provided to opponents prior to trial and\n\nno effort was made by taxing entities to prove good cause which would allow\n\n                                           20\n\fadmission. By definition, as the one document proffered by taxing entities, the trial\n\ncourt's error was harmful.\n\n      Even if the document was properly admitted, it does not prove the essential\n\nelements of taxing entities' claims and the rebuttable presumption relied upon by\n\nthem and the trial court was misplaced.          Hydrogeo effectively rebutted the\n\npresumption requiring taxing entities to offer admissible evidence to prove their\n\ncause of action. Since no evidence was offered, their claims fail.\n\n      The only document relied upon by taxing entities 1s fraught with\n\nmisinformation, such as listing the wrong owners, listing the interest as a \"royalty\n\ninterest\" and failing to segregate the amount of taxes assessed for personalty.\n\nSegregating the portion of the taxes assessed for personalty was essential because\n\nthe amount of the tax lien for personalty was unenforceable against a buyer in the\n\nordinary course of business, such as Hydrogeo. Taxing entities made no attempt to\n\nsegregate. As such, the evidence cannot support taxing entities' desire to foreclose\n\non the entire claimed lien on the two oil and gas leases in question. The trial court's\n\njudgment therefore should be reversed and rendered.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      Wherefore Premises Considered, the Court should reverse the trial court's\n\njudgment, and render judgment in favor of appellants Hydrogeo, LLC and First Bank\n\nand Trust East Texas and hold that the taxing entities take nothing against appellants.\n\n                                          21\n\f                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        Isl J.

Appellant First Bank & Trust East Texas owns a mortgage lien on the\n\nleases, which leases are located in Wood County, Texas.\n\n       The taxing entities originally filed suit in July 2012 naming three different\n\nowners and listing two leases i.e., the Denton White (Tract One) and the I.E.\n\nRobinson (Tract Two), claiming delinquent taxes owed for the years 2009 through\n\n2011, and seeking foreclosure of real and personal property interests. (1 C.R. p.8) 1\n\nAt the time of the filing of the lawsuit, taxing entities, although aware ofHydrogeo's\n\nleasehold ownership, incorrectly sued three entities who did not own any interest in\n\nthe Denton White lease. (2 R.R. p. 57, line 21 - p. 58, line 8.) Taxing entities did\n\nnot sue anyone owning an interest in the Robinson lease for the years 2010 and 2011\n\n(2 R.R. p. 109, line 7 - p. 110, line 18). Even a cursory search of the applicable\n\ncounty clerk's records or their own tax rolls would have revealed the correct owners'\n\nnames. (2 R.R. p. 25 line 20 - p. 26, line 3). It was not until a year later that they\n\nfiled a First Amended Petition naming Hydrogeo, LLC and First Bank & Trust East\n\n\n1\n  References to the Clerk's Record will be by Arabic numeral indicating the volume, the\nabbreviation \"C.R.\" and page number. References to the Reporter's Record will be in the same\nmanner using the abbreviation \"R.R.\" References to the appendix will be with the abbreviation\n\"App.\" and the letter of the referenced appendix tab.\n\n                                              1\n\fTexas for the first time. (1 C.R. p. 36) They filed a second petition naming a 50%\n\nleasehold owner in one of the two leases, DeBerry 3 Operating Company, LLC on\n\nMarch 6, 2014. ( 1 C.R. p. 164) None of appellants received notification of taxing\n\nentities' claimed tax liens prior to filing their First Amended Petition. (2 R.R. p. 56,\n\nlines 17-19). Hydrogeo, LLC has always been current on its ad valorem taxes since\n\nthe time it began operations of the two leases in 2012. (2 R.R. p. 56, lines 13-16).\n\n      As mentioned, Hydrogeo, LLC purchased the two leases in question in 2012,\n\nmeaning they did not own the properties on January 1' 1 of either 2009, 2010 or 2011,\n\nwhich is significant because Hydrogeo alleges they are buyers in ordinary course as\n\ndefined by Tex. Bus. Com. Code §1.201 (b) (9) (Vernon 1987). (2 R.R. p. 55, line\n\n19-p. 56, line 5.) Hydrogeo filed verified denials and obtained response to requests\n\nfor admissions confirming no ownership, lack of prior notice, and questioning the\n\nvalidity of the amount of the lien. (1 C.R. p. 54, 58, 78). As such, Hydrogeo contends\n\nthey effectively rebutted the presumption given to taxing authorities under Tex. Tax\n\nCode Ann. §33.47(a) (Vernon 1992). Additionally, Hydrogeo as a buyer in ordinary\n\ncourse, believe they are protected against enforcement of the taxing authorities' tax\n\nlien as it relates to any personalty located on the two oil and gas leases. (Tex. Tax\n\nCode § 32.03, App. G).\n\n      The enforceability of the tax lien was tried as a bench trial before the court on\n\nSeptember 18, 2014. The taxing entities offered Plaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\", labeled\n\n                                           2\n\f\"Certified Copy of Tax Records'', dated August 22, 2014. (2 R.R. p. 7 line 15-20).\n\nHydrogeo objected to the offer of Exhibit \"A\" for admission. (2 R.R. p. 8, line 1 -\n\nline 7). The objection dealt with the potential violation of TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6, in\n\nthat Exhibit \"A\" had not been provided to Hydrogeo prior to trial. (2 R.R. p. 8 line\n\n20 - p. 9, line 1). Hydrogeo believes the trial court erred by admitting Exhibit \"A\"\n\neven though taxing entities made no showing of good cause or lack of unfair surprise\n\nand/or prejudice. The questionable Exhibit \"A\" was the only evidence offered by\n\ntaxing entities, who then rested. (2 R.R. p. 9, line 10-16). Hydrogeo moved for\n\ndirected verdict, which was overruled. (2 R.R. p. 19, line 15-18 and 2 R.R. p. 22,\n\nline 3).\n\n       Exhibit \"A\" is a seven page document regarding the two leases, and is attached\n\nas Appendix A. Page one describes a 0.83335 royalty interest in the Denton White\n\nlease for the year 2009. (emphasis added). (2 R.R. p. 40, line 9 -p. 41, line 9). The\n\nowners of the leases on Exhibit \"A\" are listed as \"Black Diamond Operating Co.\n\nLLC\" for year 2009 and \"Rheata Resources LLC\" for years 2011 and 2012. (3 C.R.\n\np. 7-9 and App. A). The trial court subsequently ruled that Rheata Resources LLC\n\nnever owned an interest in either of the two oil and gas leases for the years in\n\nquestion and issued a directed verdict confirming its ruling. (2 R.R. p. 109, line 7 -\n\np. 110, line 18, and App. B). Subsequently, evidence at trial revealed the owner and\n\noperator of both leases during all three years in question was \"Steelman Investments,\n\n                                          3\n\fInc.\" (Defendants Black Diamond and Rheata Exhibit Nos. 3 and 5). The taxing\n\nentities have never sued \"Steelman Investments, Inc.\" for collection of the\n\ndelinquent taxes.\n\n      In addition to listing the wrong owners, Plaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\" describes, on\n\npage one, the interest being taxed as a \"royalty interest\". (App. A). Page one of\n\nExhibit \"A\" is taxing entities' sole evidentiary support for its claim for delinquent\n\ntaxes for year 2009 regarding the Denton White lease. (2 R.R. p. 7, line 15 - 20).\n\nSubsequent testimony during trial revealed that taxing entities' claim for taxes on a\n\nroyalty interest was incorrect. (2 R.R. p. 40, line 9 - p. 41, line 9). A royalty interest\n\ncomes from the lessor side of an oil and gas lease, while taxing entities' intended\n\nlien is for a working interest, which comes from the lessee side. (2 R.R. p. 40, line\n\n9, - p. 41, line 9). Despite taxing entities' Exhibit \"A\" listing the wrong owners and\n\ndescribing the wrong interest, the trial court ultimately ruled in favor of taxing\n\nentities on January 14, 2015, granting their request for foreclosure on tax liens on\n\nHydrogeo's two leases. (App. B).\n\n      Hydrogeo requested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on January 21,\n\n2015. (App. C). The trial court issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on\n\nFebruary 4, 2015. (App. D). Hydrogeo objected to the trial court's findings by\n\nrequesting Additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on February 13,\n\n2015, and by listing specific findings and conclusions. (App. E). The trial court\n\n                                            4\n\fdenied Hydrogeo' s requests by re-issuing the same Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n\nof Law on February 23, 2015. (App. F). Hydrogeo filed its Notice of Appeal on\n\nJanuary 27, 2015. (App. I).\n\n                             SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       Hydrogeo's two leases should be free from the taxing entities' efforts to\n\nforeclose because:\n\n       1)       the one piece of evidence (App. A) was incorrectly admitted by the trial\n\ncourt, in that it had not been provided to opponents prior to trial and good cause was\n\nnot shown by taxing entities to allow admission;\n\n       2)       even if Exhibit \"A\" was properly admitted, it does not prove taxing\n\nentities' claims because it lists the wrong owners, describes the wrong properties,\n\nand does not distinguish between the values given to the leases' personalty from the\n\nvalues given to the realty;\n\n       3)       taxing entities' reliance on its rebuttable presumption is misplaced\n\nbecause Hydrogeo effectively rebutted the presumption, forcing the taxing entities\n\nto prove each element of their cause of action, which they failed to do;\n\n      4)        failure by the taxing entities to prove the valid amount of the underlying\n\ntax claims is critical because without a valid debt, there can be no valid lien on which\n\nto foreclose.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Regarding the evidentiary question, the taxing entities offered one document\n\n(Exhibit \"A\") into the evidence and then rested. (2 R.R. p. 7, line 15 - p. 7, line 20);\n\n(2 R.R. p. 9, line 10 - p. 9, line 16). Exhibit \"A\" constitutes the entire proof offered\n\nby taxing entities. Since Exhibit \"A\" had not been provided to opponents prior to\n\ntrial in direct violation of TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6, the trial court had no discretion to\n\nadmit Exhibit \"A\" unless taxing entities were able to make a showing of good cause\n\nfor not complying with discovery requests. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6 (b). The record\n\nis silent on this issue; no showing was made by the taxing entities. There can be no\n\ndoubt that since Exhibit \"A\" constitutes the entire proof offered by taxing entities,\n\nthat the trial court's decision to improperly admit it constitutes harmful error.\n\n       Even if Exhibit \"A\" was properly admitted, it contains incorrect information\n\nsuch as listing the wrong owners, describing the wrong property and failing to\n\ndistinguish between realty and personalty. (App. A).\n\n      Exhibit \"A\" is a certified copy of the delinquent tax rolls regarding the alleged\n\ntax lien. Under §33.47a of the Tax Code, taxing entities are entitled to a rebuttable\n\npresumption unless Hydrogeo is able to offer sufficient evidence to rebut that\n\npresumption.    Hydrogeo offered verified pleadings, responses to requests for\n\nadmissions, documents and testimony sufficient to rebut the taxing entities'\n\npresumption. Since the burden of going forward with evidence shifted back to them,\n\nthe taxing entities were required to prove their case; they offered no additional proof.\n\n                                           6\n\f       The failure by the taxing entities to prove the valid amount of the underlying\n\ntax claims is critical because without a valid debt, there can be no valid lien on which\n\nto foreclose. A lien is incident to and inseparable from the debt. Since no attempt\n\nwas made by the taxing entities to segregate those taxes assessed for personalty,\n\nthere is no evidence of the valid amount of taxes owed. Thus, there is no evidence\n\nof a valid lien.\n\n       Since taxing entities offered less than a scintilla of admissible evidence\n\nsupporting their underlying tax claim, their alleged lien is also invalid. Thus, the\n\ntrial court's judgment permitting foreclosure ofHydrogeo's property was in error.\n\n\n                       ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n                           ISSUES PRESENTED\n                               ISSUEN0.1\n\n      Did the trial court commit reversible error by admitting Plaintiffs'\nExhibit \"A\" into evidence when the document had not been timely produced\nprior to trial, and when taxing entities failed to show good cause for its failure\nto timely supplement discovery responses.\n\n       Regarding the standard of review for the evidentiary objection presented in\n\nIssue No. 1, the trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1561557\"><a href=\"/opinion/1561557/interstate-northborough-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220\n\n(Tex. 2001 ).

Since taxing entities made no effort, and there is no record of\n\ngood cause being shown, the trial court committed error.\n\n      Taxing entities offered Plaintiffs' Exhibit \"A\" to be admitted. (2 R.R. p. 7,\n\nline 15-20). Hydrogeo objected on the grounds that the document being proffered\n\nhad not been provided to Hydrogeo prior to the trial, even though a specific request\n\nfor production had been made. (2 R.R. p. 8, line 1-p. 9, line 8). Specifically, in\n\nrequest for production No. 8, taxing entities were asked to produce, \"each and every\n\ntangible piece of evidence you plan to use at the trial of this cause.\" (2 R.R. p. 8, line\n\n21-23). Taxing entities acknowledged the proposed Exhibit \"A\" had not been\n\nprovided prior to trial but argued that the proposed exhibit was an updated version\n\nofa document produced in year 2013 without offering any evidence of how Exhibit\n\n\"A\" differed from the earlier production. (2 R.R. p 9, line 2 - 4.)\n\n      TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6 (a) states that \"a party who fails to make, amend, or\n\nsupplement a discovery response in a timely manner may not introduce in evidence\n\nthe material or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony of a\n\nwitness other than a named party who was not timely identified unless the court finds\n\nthat: \"l) there was good cause for the failure to timely make, amend or supplement\n\nthe discovery response; or 2) the failure to timely make, amend or supplement the\n\ndiscovery response will not unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties.\"\n\n(App. J).\n\n                                            8\n\f       The burden of proving good cause and/or a lack of unfair prejudice rests on\n\ntaxing entities as the party introducing the evidence.

App.-Dallas\n\n2004, no pet.), states that after the taxing authority makes its prima facia case by\n\nintroducing the tax records required by Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 33.47(a) (Vernon\n\n1992), the burden then shifts to the taxpayer to show, by introducing competent\n\nevidence, that he has paid the full amount of taxes, penalties and interest, or that\n\nthere is some other defense that applies to his case. (Emphasis added).\n\n      In this case the defense is not misidentification of the party, but rather lack of\n\nownership, failure to prove the amount of taxes due on the underlying debt, failure\n\nto correctly identify the interest on which the lien was claimed and lack of\n\nenforceability of the tax lien. On these issues Hydrogeo offered competent evidence\n\nrebutting the presumption set out in §33.47(a). Once that happened, taxing entities\n\nwere required to establish sufficient evidence to support their alleged claims. As\n\nstated in the Estates of Elkins case, if the taxing authorities' evidence did, in fact,\n\ncreate a legal presumption, that presumption disappeared when the Estates offered\n\nevidence rebutting the taxing authorities' evidence. See also DMV Vacuum Services,\n\nInc. v. Zavala County Appraisal District (explaining the presumption under\n\n§33.47(a)). As the DMV court explains, ifthe taxpayer offers evidence sufficient to\n\njustify a finding against a presumed fact, the presumption disappears as to that\n\nelement of the taxing authorities' cause of action. The taxing authorities' evidence\n\nthen has to stand on its own to prove that particular element.

Therefore, the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor\n\nof the appellant.\n\n       Another case, Maximum Medical Improvement, Inc. v. County ofDallas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991572\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991572/maximum-medical-imp-inc-v-county-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.) found that \"when a taxing\n\nauthority's prima facia case is rebutted, the presumption disappears ... \" As in our\n\ncase, the taxpayer filed a verified denial that it was improperly sued, claiming that\n\nanother entity was a proper party. Dallas County attempted, as in this case, to argue\n\nthat the prima facia presumption still applies. The court of appeals disagreed,\n\nreversed the judgment and rendered a take nothing judgment on Dallas County's\n\nclaims.\n\n      Hydrogeo is an oil and gas operator, and the property sought to be foreclosed\n\non by taxing entities is two producing oil and gas leases. As it relates to ad valorem\n\ntaxes, these properties are taxed in at least two different categories: 1) the leasehold\n\nestate itself, which is the oil and gas in the ground, including the legal right to operate\n\nthe well; 2) the actual production equipment, such as casing, tubing, pump jacks,\n\ntanks, and surface pipelines.\n\n                                            15\n\f      According to their Second Amended Petition, at least a portion of taxing\n\nentities' judgment sought was due to taxes on Hydrogeo's personalty. (1 C.R. p.\n\n164). Its petition states that \"the value of any personal property that may be described\n\nabove, and which the tax lien is sought to be enforced, is in excess of FIVE\n\nHUNDRED AND NO 100/ DOLLARS ($500.00)\". Taxing entities clearly seek to\n\nforeclose on a tax lien against both personal and real property.\n\n         As stated in a 1997 Texas Attorney General Opinion, \"irrespective of whether\n\nproduction equipment is real or personal property, it must be appraised separately\n\nfrom its corresponding mineral leasehold interest. Opinion No. DM-438, May 2,\n\n1997. As the opinion also recognizes, the classification of property as real or\n\npersonal is material to such matters as the statute of limitations because the statute\n\ntreats real and personal property differently. Tex. Tax Code Ann.§ 33.05 (Vernon\n\n1992).\n\n         The statute of limitations is not the only issue the legislature uses to treat real\n\nand personal property differently. In our case, Hydrogeo, because of the undisputed\n\nevidence offered at trial, is exempt from having any lien foreclosed on their\n\npersonalty. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 32.03 (Vernon 1992), and Tex. Bus. & Com.\n\nCode Ann. §1.201(b)(9)(Vernon 1987). Since Hydrogeo filed a verified denial\n\ncontesting ownership of the property during the applicable years in question and\n\nquestioning the sufficiency of the lien on the property both real and personal, the\n\n                                             16\n\fburden of proof to plead and prove all of the elements of taxing entities' claim shifted\n\nto them. They offered no evidence distinguishing between the amounts of the lien\n\nclaimed for real property compared to the amount claimed for personalty. Thus,\n\ntaxing entities failed, as a matter of law, to meet their burden of proof.\n\n      Tex. Tax Code Ann §32.03(a) states in part \"[E]xcept as provided by\n\nSubsection (a-1), a tax lien may not be enforced against personal property transferred\n\nto a buyer in ordinary course of business as defined by § 1.201 (9) of the Business\n\nand Commerce Code for value who does not have actual notice of the existence of\n\nthe lien.\" (App. G). The exception listed in Subsection a-1 applies only to\n\nmanufactured homes, and has no application to our case. According to § 1.201 (b)(9),\n\na \"buyer in ordinary course of business\" essentially means a person that buys in good\n\nfaith, without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person. (App.\n\nH). Thus, combining the elements of §32.03(a) and §1.20l(b)(9), Hydrogeo needs\n\nto show they paid value for their personalty, without notice of the lien, in an arm's\n\nlength transaction, and in the normal course of business.\n\n      The undisputed evidence presented at trial is that Hydrogeo was a buyer in\n\nordinary course of business as defined. Bill Godsey testified he had no knowledge\n\nof a previous tax lien. (2 R.R. p. 55, line 11-15). He testified Hydrogeo paid value\n\nfor the leases. (2 R.R. p. 55, line 19-21). He testified Hydrogeo comported with the\n\nusual and customary practices of a buyer in the industry, in an arm's length\n\n                                           17\n\ftransaction. (2 R.R. p. 55, line 22-p. 56, line 5). No effort was made by taxing\n\nentities to rebut this line of testimony.\n\n       Once Hydrogeo established itself as a buyer in the ordinary course of business,\n\nthe taxing entities' claim for a tax lien regarding Hydrogeo's personalty is not\n\nenforceable. (App G.). The next question is whether taxing entities segregated that\n\nportion of its unenforceable lien from the enforceable part. In order to answer this\n\nquestion, the trial court should have determined what portion of the taxes were\n\nassessed for the personalty, compared to that portion assessed for the realty. The\n\npersonalty is that portion of the leases which is not fixed to the realty.\n\n      In determining whether oil and gas equipment is a fixture to real estate, courts\n\nconsider primarily the intention of the party making the annexation.

Mullis, 686\n\nS.W.2d, 605, 607-08 (Tex. 1985). In the trial of this case Bill Godsey, president of\n\nHydrogeo, testified he can and will remove any and all production equipment from\n\nthe two leases in question. (2 R.R., p. 62, line 10 - p. 64, line 3.) Loretta Ward,\n\nlandman for Hydrogeo also testified that the equipment can and will be removed. (2\n\nR.R. p. 26, line 7 - p. 26, line 17.) Since the testimony offers undisputed evidence\n\nregarding the intent of the owner of the equipment in question, the only decision\n\nsupported by the evidence is that all of the production equipment on the two oil and\n\ngas leases is personalty. This distinction is important because Hydrogeo as a buyer\n\n                                            18\n\fin ordinary course as defined in Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 32.03 (a) (Vernon 1992), is\n\nexempt from enforcement of any part of the taxing entities' alleged lien against their\n\npersonalty. (Id.)\n\n       Because at least a portion of the lien is unenforceable, it was incumbent on\n\ntaxing entities to prove at trial how much of their alleged lien was due to the\n\npersonalty on the two well locations. This the taxing entities failed to do. (2 R.R.\n\np. 88, line 7- 14.) In fact, the only testimony regarding the value of the personalty\n\nwas provided by Bill Godsey, President ofHydrogeo, (2 R.R. p. 59, line 10 - p. 61,\n\nline 16, and Exhibit HB-9), showing that the value of the personalty actually exceeds\n\nthe total appraised value of the leases.\n\n       Since taxing entities' lien is based on a total value of the taxes due for both\n\nrealty and personalty, and because that portion of the lien for personalty is\n\nunenforceable, and since the value of the personalty exceeds the value of taxing\n\nentities' entire alleged lien, the underlying basis for the alleged lien fails as a matter\n\nof law. The taxing entities' claim of right to foreclose on Hydrogeo's two leases\n\nalso fails.\n\n       Taxing entities must prove the amount of the underlying debt on the real\n\nproperty. A lien is an incident of, and is inseparable from, the debt.

By definition, as the one document proffered by taxing entities, the trial\n\ncourt's error was harmful.\n\n      Even if the document was properly admitted, it does not prove the essential\n\nelements of taxing entities' claims and the rebuttable presumption relied upon by\n\nthem and the trial court was misplaced.          Hydrogeo effectively rebutted the\n\npresumption requiring taxing entities to offer admissible evidence to prove their\n\ncause of action. Since no evidence was offered, their claims fail.\n\n      The only document relied upon by taxing entities 1s fraught with\n\nmisinformation, such as listing the wrong owners, listing the interest as a \"royalty\n\ninterest\" and failing to segregate the amount of taxes assessed for personalty.\n\nSegregating the portion of the taxes assessed for personalty was essential because\n\nthe amount of the tax lien for personalty was unenforceable against a buyer in the\n\nordinary course of business, such as Hydrogeo. Taxing entities made no attempt to\n\nsegregate. As such, the evidence cannot support taxing entities' desire to foreclose\n\non the entire claimed lien on the two oil and gas leases in question. The trial court's\n\njudgment therefore should be reversed and rendered.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      Wherefore Premises Considered, the Court should reverse the trial court's\n\njudgment, and render judgment in favor of appellants Hydrogeo, LLC and First Bank\n\nand Trust East Texas and hold that the taxing entities take nothing against appellants.\n\n                                          21\n\f                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        Isl J.
