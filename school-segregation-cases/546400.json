Appellants contend that\nthey have standing to pursue their challenges, and that the Act\ndoes not bar judicial review of the Secretary of Education’s\nchoice of committee members. Because we agree with the\nDistrict Court’s holding that Appellants lack standing to pursue\ntheir claims, we affirm the judgments of the court. Moreover,\nbecause this Court concludes that it lacks Article III jurisdiction\nover this case, it does not consider the alternate issue of whether\njudicial review is barred by the Act.\n\n                         I. Background\n\n    A. The No Child Left Behind Act\n\n     On January 8, 2002, the President signed into law the “No\nChild Left Behind Act” (“NCLBA” or “the Act”). Pub. L. No.\n107-110, 115 Stat. 1425, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq.\nThe Act requires each State to implement statewide\naccountability systems for all public schools and their students,\nto define education standards, and to establish a system of\nassessments for measuring whether students have met those\nstandards. 20 U.S.C. § 6311. Under the Act, a school’s\n\f                                 3\n\ncontinued failure to make adequate yearly progress toward\nmeeting proficiency goals will give rise to assistance and\nintervention, with parents of students in failing schools allowed\nto transfer their children to better schools. Id. at § 6316(b).\n\n     The Act authorizes the Department of Education (“DOE”)\nto adopt regulations for the oversight of States’ design of\nstandards and assessments. 20 U.S.C. § 6571. In order to\n“ensure that final regulations are issued by the Secretary not\nlater than” January 8, 2003, id. at § 6571(b)(4)(A), Congress\ndirected the Secretary to utilize a “negotiated rulemaking\nprocess.” Id. at § 6571(b)(3)(A).\n\n      The framework for promulgating and adopting regulations\nunder the Act is laid out with specificity. First, the Secretary of\nEducation is to “obtain the advice and recommendations” of\nvarious interest groups. Id. at § 6571(b)(1). Second, the\nSecretary shall “establish a negotiated rulemaking process” for\nthe purpose of drafting regulations, id. at § 6571(b)(3)(A), and\nselect individuals to participate in such process “from among\nindividuals or groups that provided advice and recommendations\n. . . in such numbers as will provide an equitable balance\nbetween representatives of parents and students and\nrepresentatives of educators and education officials . . . .” Id. at\n§ 6571(b)(3)(B). Finally, “[s]uch process” shall be conducted\nbefore January 8, 2003. Id. at § 6571(b)(4)(A). The Secretary\nprovides draft regulations to committee members prior to their\nfirst meeting. Id. at § 6571(b)(3)(C). The process “shall not be\nsubject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, but shall\notherwise follow the provisions of the Negotiated Rulemaking\nAct of 1990 (5 U.S.C. 561 et seq.).” Id. at § 6571(b)(4).\n\n     This incorporation of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act\n(“NRA”) implicates jurisdictional concerns, as the NRA bars\njudicial review of “[a]ny agency action relating to establishing,\n\f                                 4\n\nassisting, or terminating a negotiated rulemaking committee\nunder this subchapter,” unless such review is otherwise provided\nby statute. 5 U.S.C. § 570. Section 6571(b)(4) does not\nexplicitly describe selection of committee members as being\nincluded in the “process” subject to the provisions of the NRA,\nbut it does not explicitly exclude member selection from the\n“process” subject to the NRA.\n\n   B.     Implementation         of   the    Act’s   Framework;\nContemporaneous Lawsuits\n\n      On January 18, 2002, DOE published a request for advice\nand recommendations in the Federal Register. 67 Fed. Reg.\n2770. On February 12, 2002, DOE issued an invitation for the\nsubmission of possible participants in the negotiated rulemaking.\nSee Email from Susan B. Neuman, Ed.D., Assistant Secretary of\nElementary and Secondary Education (Feb. 12, 2002), reprinted\nin Joint Appendix at 380-81. While the notice did stress that\n“[t]he nominees should be practitioners . . . [i.e.], they should be\nsignificantly involved with implementing and operating Title I\nprograms,” id., it also noted that the negotiated rulemaking was\nto include “representatives of Federal, State and local\nadministrators; parents; teachers and paraprofessionals;\nmembers of local school boards; and other organizations . . . .”\nId.\n\n     The committee convened by the Secretary consisted of 24\nmembers. According to the DOE, this body consisted of six\nrepresentatives of “State Administrators and State Boards of\nEducation,” four representatives of “Local Administrators and\nLocal School Boards,” four representatives of “Principals and\nTeachers,” seven representatives of “Students” (including one\nteacher, a few administrators, and a representative of a Diocese),\none representative of “Business Interests,” and two\nrepresentatives of the DOE. 67 Fed. Reg. 9223, 9224 (Feb. 28,\n\f                               5\n\n2002), corrected at 67 Fed. Reg. 9935 (Mar. 5, 2002). The\nparties do not specify whether any of the non-“parent”/\n“teacher” representatives are, themselves, parents or teachers.\nAppellants dispute the nominal makeup of this body. They\nclaim that “only one” member represented “the interests of all\npublic school parents and students,” because some\nrepresentatives actually stood in for “multiple perspectives.”\nBrief for Appellants at 11.\n\n      The February 28 notice gave individuals and groups who\n“felt that his or her interests [we]re not adequately represented\nby this . . . group” the opportunity to petition at the March 11\nmeeting, in person, to be seated as a negotiator. 67 Fed. Reg.\n9224. Plaintiff organization Designs For Change attempted to\npetition by phone to be seated (claiming that travel was\neconomically infeasible). The DOE declined to hear the\nphoned-in petition. Decl. of Weckstein, Joint Appendix at 121.\nAppellants assert that Center for Law and Education also\npetitioned to be seated, Brief for Appellant at 13, although no\nsuch petition is apparent from the record. Likewise, it is not\napparent that plaintiff Lindsey petitioned to be seated.\n\n     Appellants filed suit in District Court on March 8, 2002.\nThey alleged that the committee did not achieve “an equitable\nbalance between representatives of parents and students and\nrepresentatives of educators and education officials,” and sought\na preliminary injunction. While the suit was pending, the\ncommittee convened, reviewed the Secretary’s draft regulations,\nand reached consensus on every issue of academic standards and\nassessments before it. See 67 Fed. Reg. 30,452 (May 6, 2002).\nThe Secretary received the committee’s proposed rules, and\npublished them for public notice and comment. Id. During the\ncomment period, the DOE convened five regional meetings for\nfurther comment. Id.\n\f                                6\n\n      In May 2002, the District Court held that it lacked\njurisdiction over Appellants’ challenge on two grounds. First,\nit held that the NRA § 570 judicial-review bar precluded judicial\nreview of a challenge to the committee’s composition prior to\npromulgation of final rules. Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Educ., 209 F. Supp. 2d 102, 106-07 (D.D.C. 2002).\nThe court noted the plaintiffs’ argument that § 570 only applies\nto the “process” of committee deliberation, as 20 U.S.C. § 6571\nprovides that committee members would “participate in such\nprocess . . . .” 209 F. Supp. 2d. at 107. But the court ultimately\nrejected this interpretation of “process” because of “the\nimplications of plaintiffs’ theory.”     Id.   Specifically, such\ninterpretation would require DOE to segregate the NCLBA into\n“process” and “non-process” provisions, and apply the NRA\naccordingly; the Court saw such segregation and selective\napplication to be implausible. Id. at 107-08. Moreover, to allow\nfor lawsuits over selection of committee members would make\ncompliance with the NCLBA’s strict time limits infeasible.\nId. at 108.\n\n    Second, the court held that review was unavailable under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), because selection of\nthe committee was not “final agency action.” Id. at 111.\nAppellants filed an appeal, which later was stayed at Appellants’\nrequest.\n\n     In July 2002, the DOE published its final rules on state\nstandards and assessments. 67 Fed. Reg. 45,038 (July 5, 2002)\n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 200). The final rules took effect\non August 5, 2002. Id.\n\n     In December 2002, Appellants filed a new complaint. They\ndid not challenge the substance of the rules on traditional APA\ngrounds. See 5 U.S.C. § 706. Instead, they again focused on the\ncomposition of the committee, calling for the rules to be set\n\f                                7\n\naside and a new committee formed. On March 26, 2004, the\nDistrict Court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, holding\nthat Appellants lacked standing. Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Educ., 315 F. Supp. 2d 15 (D.D.C. 2004). The court\nheld that DFC and CLE (“the organizational plaintiffs”) failed\nto demonstrate a procedural injury because the Act “contains no\nrequirement that advocacy groups be represented on the\nnegotiated rulemaking committee.” Id. at 23. The court also\nrejected the organizations’ standing on other grounds regarding\nlack of actual injury (i.e., the rules “do[] no more than arguably\noffend their policy goals,” id. at 24) and lack of causation (i.e.,\nthe alleged injury was not caused by the formation of the\ncommittee, but rather, by subsequent choices made by State\nagencies. Id. at 25). As to the individual plaintiff, Rachelle\nLindsey, the court held that because the Act created no\nenforceable right to have an equitably balanced committee,\nLindsey suffered no actual injury. The “risk” that her children\nwould not receive a high-quality education was too\n“hypothetical” and was dependant on the actions of the States,\nnot the DOE. Id. at 26-29. Finally, the court also held that\nincorporation of the NRA included incorporation of its bar on\njudicial review of the establishment of the negotiated\nrulemaking committee. Id. at 29-33.\n\n                          II. Analysis\n\n     This Court reviews de novo a dismissal for lack of standing.\nNat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d\n930, 937 (D.C. Cir. 2004). A dismissal for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction is also reviewed de novo. Flynt v. Rumsfeld,\n355 F.3d 697, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2004). In reviewing a ruling on a\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all facts alleged\nby the nonmoving party and must draw all inferences in favor of\nthe nonmoving party.\n\f                                8\n\n    A. The Judicial Review Bar\n\n      As noted above, DOE raises two jurisdictional arguments:\nfirst, that Appellants lack Article III standing; and second, that\nCongress deprived this Court of jurisdiction to review the\ncomposition of the committee. Supra pages 3-4, 5-6. Because,\nas we discuss below, we hold that Appellants lack Article III\nstanding, we do not consider the question, never before raised in\nthis Court, of whether judicial review is barred in this matter.\nWe “need not identify every ground for holding that a claim is\nnot justiciable.” Fourth Branch Assocs. (Mechanicville) v.\nFERC, 253 F.3d 741, 745 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Indep.\nPetroleum Ass’n of America v. Babbitt, 235 F.3d 588, 594 (D.C.\nCir. 2001)). “[W]e have no trouble dismissing a claim ‘based on\none jurisdictional bar rather than another.’”         Id. (quoting\nLouisiana Envtl. Action Network v. Browner, 87 F.3d 1379,\n1384 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). See also New Jersey Television Corp.\nv. FCC, No. 03-1444, slip op. at 3 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 28, 2004).\nAny statements by this Court on the question of the judicial\nreview bar would be “unnecessary dicta,” which “precedent and\nprudence counsel us to avoid . . . .” Louisiana Envtl. Action\nNetwork, 87 F.3d at 1385.\n\n    B. Standing\n\n      This Court, like all Article III courts, is one of limited\njurisdiction; we cannot decide cases that we lack constitutional\nauthority to decide. Wyoming Outdoor Council v. U.S. Forest\nService, 165 F.3d 43, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1999). We are empowered\nto hear only “cases or controversies.” U.S. CONST . art. III, § 2.\nWe ascertain whether or not the matter before us is a “case” or\n“controversy” by looking to whether, inter alia, the litigants\nhave “standing.” Wyoming Outdoor Council, 165 F.3d at 48.\nThe “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains\nthree elements”: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered injury in\n\f                                 9\n\nfact, an actual or imminent invasion of a legally protected,\nconcrete and particularized interest; (2) there must be a causal\nconnection between the alleged injury and the defendant’s\nconduct at issue; and (3) it must be “likely,” not “speculative,”\nthat the court can redress the injury. Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). Where plaintiffs allege\ninjury resulting from violation of a procedural right afforded to\nthem by statute and designed to protect their threatened concrete\ninterest, the courts relax–while not wholly eliminating–the\nissues of imminence and redressability, but not the issues of\ninjury in fact or causation. See Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen,\n94 F.3d 658, 664-65 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (citing Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 572-73 & nn. 8-9). Taken together, the plaintiffs\nhave standing only if, inter alia, (1) the government violated\ntheir procedural rights designed to protect their threatened\nconcrete interest, and (2) the violation resulted in injury to their\nconcrete, particularized interest. Plaintiffs fail to satisfy either\nof the requirements at issue.\n\n          1. Violation of a procedural right designed to protect\nplaintiffs’ interests\n\n    Appellants fail to show that a procedural right sufficient for\nstanding has been violated. Not all procedural-rights violations\nare sufficient for standing; a plaintiff must show that “the\nprocedures in question are designed to protect some threatened\nconcrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.”\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 573 n.8 (emphases added).\n\n     With respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the procedural\nrights at issue are clearly insufficient for standing, as the\nprocedures at issue were not designed to protect “some\nthreatened concrete interest of” the organizations. The No Child\nLeft Behind Act required the Secretary to “select individuals to\nparticipate in such process from among individuals or groups\n\f                                 10\n\nthat provided advice and recommendations, including\nrepresentation from all geographic regions of the United States,\nin such numbers as will provide an equitable balance between\nrepresentatives of parents and students and representatives of\neducators and educational officials.” 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3)(B).\nNowhere does the Act make mention of advocacy organizations’\ninterests.     The only interests arguably enjoying implicit\nprotection here are those of parents, students, educators and\neducation officials; although the advocacy groups may be\n“representatives” of parents and students, the interests to be\nprotected are those of the parents and students, not of the\norganizations.\n\n      Even in the case of the individual plaintiff, Lindsey, it is not\nat all clear that the Act’s procedures regarding the negotiated\nrulemaking process were “designed to protect” the interests of\nparents and students. The structure of § 6571 as a whole shows\nthat Congress manifestly did not endorse “protective” litigation\nregarding the formation of the committee amidst the time-\nlimited rulemaking process. The Act specifically mandated that\n“[s]uch [rulemaking] process shall be conducted in a timely\nmanner to ensure that final regulations are issued by the\nSecretary not later than 1 year after January 8, 2002[.]” 20\nU.S.C. § 6571(b)(4)(A). And, as noted above, the Act created\na complex process for crafting federal and state regulations that\nwould affect parents’ and students’ interests, including the Act’s\nprovision for the selection of an “equitable balance” of\ncommittee members. These provisions do not offer any promise\nof purposeful protection of the concrete interests of students and\nparents. Appellants cite the Conference Report for evidence that\n“Congress sought to ‘ensu[re] that the views of both program\nbeneficiaries and program providers are fairly heard and\nconsidered.’” Brief for Appellants at 9 (quoting H.R. CONF. REP .\n107-334, at 809, reprinted in 2001 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1230, 1352).\nThis is not persuasive evidence of protective design. To the\n\f                                11\n\nextent that the legislative history is relevant to the question\nbefore us, we note that the language of the report does not\nsupport Appellants’ position; if anything, it weighs against it:\n“The Conferees do not intend this language to require strict\nnumerical equality or comparability among these\nrepresentatives. Rather, the Conferees intend the Secretary to\nhave flexibility in selecting the [committee members.]” H.R.\nCONF. REP . 107-334 at 809.\n\n     With respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the NCLBA\nclearly did not create procedural rights designed to protect their\nconcrete interests. With respect to Lindsey, the NCLBA did not\nclearly create such a right; but as the next section of this\nstanding analysis makes clear, even if NCLBA did create such\na right, she has not suffered injury sufficient to establish\nstanding.\n\n         2. Injury to a concrete, particularized interest\n\n     Appellants present a variety of alleged “injuries” as a result\nof the Secretary’s selection of committee members. Appellants\nargue that the individual plaintiff, parent Rachelle Lindsey, has\nsuffered three injuries as a result of the Secretary’s selection of\ncommittee members: First, she was deprived of her procedural\nright to help shape the final rules. Brief for Appellants at 16.\nSecond, the final rules increased the “risk” that her children will\nbe denied the benefit of the best-possible education and those\nrules were caused by the committee selection. Id. at 17. Third,\nthe final rules fail to require States to provide for public\nparticipation in the creation of standards and measures under the\nAct, and those final rules were caused by the committee\nselection. Id.\n\n     Appellants also argue that the organizational plaintiffs have\nsuffered four injuries as a result of the Secretary’s selection of\n\f                                12\n\ncommittee members: First, the Secretary’s apportionment of\ncommittee seats among representatives of various interests\nreduced their chances of serving on the committee. Id. at 16.\nSecond, the selection excluded parent and student advocacy\norganizations from consideration. Id. Third, the final rules\nforced them to address advocacy issues on an expensive State-\nby-State basis. Id. at 17. Fourth, the final rules failed to require\nStates to provide for public participation. Id.\n\n      Taken together, Appellants allege four basic categories of\ninjuries:\n\n         (1) Injuries to Plaintiff Lindsey caused by the\n             final rules, following selection of the\n             committee members;\n\n         (2) Injuries to Plaintiff Lindsey caused by the\n             Secretary’s abridgment of her procedural\n             rights in the selection of committee members;\n\n         (3) Injuries to Plaintiff Organizations caused by\n             the final rules, following selection of the\n             committee members; and\n\n         (4) Injuries to Plaintiff Organizations caused by\n             the Secretary’s abridgment of their procedural\n             rights in the selection of committee members.\n\nTo organize Appellants’ alleged injuries in this fashion reveals\nwhat Appellants’ muddled brief obfuscates: Appellants allege\ntwo classes of injury under a Procedural Rights theory of\nstanding. Appellants allege injuries to Appellants’ procedural\nrights per se, and they allege injuries to their particularized\ninterests caused by the final rules. We consider these classes of\n\f                                   13\n\ninjuries in turn.1\n\n                a. Injury to their procedural interests\n\n     Appellants first allege that they suffered injury, as a result\nof the Secretary’s failure to abide by the procedures prescribed\nby the Act, to their interest in the government’s protection of\ntheir procedural rights.\n\n      As this Court sitting en banc described at length in Florida\nAudubon Society, a procedural-rights plaintiff must demonstrate\nstanding by “show[ing] not only that the defendant’s acts\nomitted some procedural requirement, but also that it is\nsubstantially probable that the procedural breach will cause the\nessential injury to the plaintiff’s own interest.” 94 F.3d at 664-\n65. In other words, while we relax the imminence and\nredressability requirements, the procedural-rights plaintiff must\nstill satisfy the general requirements of the constitutional\nstandards of particularized injury and causation. See id. at 664.\nAlthough Appellants rely heavily on footnote 7 of Lujan in\narguing procedural standing in this case, even in that case the\nCourt required a showing that “concrete interests” had been\ninvaded. 504 U.S. at 572 n.7.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n        Appellants do not argue that the organizational plaintiffs retain\n“representational standing” to press claims on behalf of individual\nmembers of the organization. Nonetheless, this Court notes in its own\njurisdictional inquiry that these organizational plaintiffs would not\nsatisfy the test for representational standing, because such plaintiffs\nwould need to show actual or imminent injury to their members\ncaused by the challenged action. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511\n(1975). As we discuss below, Appellants fail to show any such\ncausation here.\n\f                               14\n\n      Assuming arguendo that a procedural right designed to\nprotect a concrete interest of the Appellants has been violated\nhere, Appellants fail to demonstrate how they suffer actual\ninjury to a concrete, particularized interest, caused by the\nchallenged conduct. The chain of causation between the alleged\nprocedural violation and the concrete interest is speculative at\nbest. See infra pages 16-17. “Unadorned speculation will not\nsuffice to invoke the judicial power.” Physicians Ed. Network\nv. Dep’t of H.E.W., 653 F.2d 621, 627 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (district\ncourt’s opinion expressly adopted en toto by Court) (quoting\nSimon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26,\n44 (1976)).\n\n     But even more importantly, Appellants appear to\nmisunderstand the difference between the “procedural right” and\nthe “concrete interest” in a procedural-rights case. See, e.g.,\nBrief of Appellants at 23 (“The Department’s denial of this right\nconstitutes sufficient injury to support standing.”). The two\nthings are not one and the same. Appellants must show both (1)\nthat their procedural right has been violated, and (2) that the\nviolation of that right has resulted in an invasion of their\nconcrete and particularized interest. “[A] prospective plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that the defendant caused the particularized\ninjury, and not just the alleged procedural violation.” Fla.\nAudubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664 (emphasis added). In Lujan the\nSupreme Court disclaimed Appellants’ conflation of concrete\ninterest and procedural right in unambiguous language:\n\n    If we understand this [argument] correctly, it means that the\n    Government’s violation of a certain . . . class of procedural\n    duty satisfies the concrete-injury requirement by itself,\n    without any showing that the procedural violation\n    endangers a concrete interest of the plaintiff (apart from his\n    interest in having the procedure observed). We cannot\n    agree.\n\f                                15\n\n504 U.S. at 573 n.8. Appellants must allege injury beyond mere\nprocedural misstep per se to satisfy standing in a procedural-\nrights case, and they fail to do so here.\n\n      In sum, we hold that Appellants have failed to show that the\nalleged procedural violation caused actual injury to Appellants’\nconcrete interests such that they satisfy Article III’s requirement\nof standing. Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664.\n\n              b. Injuries to other interests, caused by the final\nrules\n\n     Appellants allege injury not only to their procedural\ninterest, but also to their interests in education, lobbying, and\nother interests apart from procedural rights per se. Even\nassuming arguendo that their purported interests do constitute\nparticularized, concrete interests sufficient to satisfy Lujan, see\n504 U.S. at 560, Appellants fail to demonstrate the necessary\ncausal connection between the challenged agency action–here,\nthe promulgation of final rules–and the alleged injury.\n\n     To demonstrate standing, Appellants must show “a causal\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained\nof–the injury has to be ‘fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged\naction of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the\nindependent action of some third party not before the court.’”\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 41-42).\n\n     To show causation and redressability in their procedural-\nrights case, Appellants need not demonstrate that, but for the\nprocedural defect, the final outcome of the rulemaking process\nwould have been different, and that this Court’s ordering the\naction to remedy the procedural defect will alter the final effect\non Appellants’ interests. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7. In\nshort, this Court assumes the causal relationship between the\n\f                                  16\n\nprocedural defect and the final agency action. Nonetheless,\nAppellants must still demonstrate a causal relationship between\nthe final agency action and the alleged injuries.2\n\n     In the case of Lindsey, the agency action and the alleged\ninjury stand at opposite ends of a long chain: (1) DOE\npromulgated final rules giving discretion to the States to\nimplement their own rules for the education of children in the\nState; (2) the State of Illinois, in its discretion, implemented\nrules that were permitted but not required by DOE; (3) those\nrules increased the risk of improper evaluation of students and\nschools; (4) Lindsey’s daughter’s school might be improperly\nclassified as a result (though it presently receives federal\nfunding under the NCLBA); (5) Lindsey’s daughter might\nthereby be harmed by improper classification.\n\n     Having outlined the alleged causal chain, we conclude that\nthe connection between the beginning and end of the purported\nchain remains so attenuated that we cannot hold the alleged\n\n\n    2\n       We note that where, as here, the purported cause of injury (i.e.,\npromulgation of final rules) and the injury itself is separated by\nintervening actors and events, the causation and redressability\ninquiries may appear to merge.\n\n        In such cases, both prongs of standing analysis can be said to\n        focus on principles of causation: fair traceability turns on the\n        causal nexus between the agency action and the asserted\n        injury, while redressability centers on the causal connection\n        between the asserted injury and judicial relief. Despite these\n        similarities, however, each inquiry has its own emphasis.\n        Causation remains inherently historical; redressability\n        quintessentially predictive.\n\nFreedom Republicans v. FEC, 13 F.3d 412, 418 (D.C. Cir. 1994)\n(citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\f                                   17\n\ninjury to be “fairly traceable to” the final agency rules “and not\nthe result of the independent action” of the State of Illinois.\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560. Where “the necessary elements of\ncausation and redressability . . . hinge on the independent\nchoices of the regulated third party,” i.e. the States, “it becomes\nthe burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those\nchoices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce\ncausation and permit redressability of injury.” Nat’l Wrestling\nCoaches Ass’n, 366 F.3d at 938 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Appellants fall far short of\ncarrying their burden.\n\n     Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the alleged injury\nto Lindsey is “concrete and particularized.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n560. Appellants allege direct injury styled as “increased risk,”\nin the form of giving the States the opportunity to injure\nAppellants’ interests. This so-called “injury” is insufficient for\nstanding.\n\n     Outside of increased exposure to environmental harms,\nhypothesized “increased risk” has never been deemed sufficient\n“injury.”3 And even if “risk” were sufficient injury for standing\nin the non-environmental context, Lindsey would have to show\n\n    3\n     We do not read Electric Power Supply Ass’n v. FERC, No. 03-\n1182, 2004 WL 2828047 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 10, 2004), to extend the\n“enhanced risk” analysis. That case dealt with standing to challenge\na federal agency’s arguably ultra vires publications of regulations\npurporting to authorize ex parte communications in violation of the\nSunshine Act, Pub. L. No. 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241 (1976). While in a\nsense a violation of rights protected by that statute could be called\nprocedural, in the final analysis, the violation supporting standing goes\nto substantive rights created under the Act. Electric Power Supply\nAssociation’s analysis of standing to assert those rights is not authority\nfor the general proposition of applicability of “enhanced risk” analysis\nto procedural violations in the determination of standing.\n\f                                18\n\nthat the challenged conduct has created a “demonstrably\nincreased risk” that “actually threatens the plaintiff’s particular\ninterests.” Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 667 (emphasis\nadded). Here, Lindsey has hypothesized that the final agency\nrules have increased the risk to her interests, but she has offered\nthis Court no actual demonstration of increased risk.\n\n     Indeed, were all purely speculative “increased risks”\ndeemed injurious, the entire requirement of “actual or imminent\ninjury” would be rendered moot, because all hypothesized, non-\nimminent “injuries” could be dressed up as “increased risk of\nfuture injury.”\n\n     With respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the causal\nchain between the challenged rules and the alleged injury is not\nso attenuated: The organizations allege that the Federal rules\nforce them to change their lobbying strategies, a more costly\nform of lobbying. But while their causal chain may be more\ntraceable than Lindsey’s, it fails to bind the challenged conduct\nto actual injury. This Court has not found standing when the\nonly “injury” arises from the effect of the regulations on the\norganizations’ lobbying activities (as opposed to the effect on\nnon-lobbying activities): “[C]onflict between a defendant’s\nconduct and an organization’s mission is alone insufficient to\nestablish Article III standing. Frustration of an organization’s\nobjectives is the type of abstract concern that does not impart\nstanding.” Nat’l Treas. Employees Union v. United States, 101\nF.3d 1423, 1429 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     The case before us is easily distinguished from Havens\nRealty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982). There, the Court\nheld that an organization dedicated to promoting equal-access to\nhousing had standing to challenge defendants’ practice of\nsteering prospective tenants away, because defendants’ practice\n\f                                    19\n\n“perceptibly impaired HOME’s ability to provide counseling\nand referral services for low- and moderate-income\nhome-seekers . . . .” Id. at 379. Here, the only “service”\nimpaired is pure issue-advocacy–the very type of activity\ndistinguished by Havens. See id. at 379 (distinguishing Sierra\nClub v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 739 (1972)).4\n\n     In sum, Appellants fail to demonstrate standing arising from\nthe effect of the final rules, with respect to either the individual\n\n\n    4\n       In Sierra Club, the Supreme Court recognized that to hold that\na lobbyist/advocacy group had standing to challenge government\npolicy with no injury other than injury to its advocacy would\neviscerate standing doctrine’s actual injury requirement:\n\n        It is clear that an organization whose members are injured\n        may represent those members in a proceeding for judicial\n        review. See, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 428\n        [1963]. But a mere “interest in a problem,” no matter how\n        longstanding the interest and no matter how qualified the\n        organization is in evaluating the problem, is not sufficient by\n        itself to render the organization “adversely affected” or\n        “aggrieved” within the meaning of the APA. The Sierra Club\n        is a large and long-established organization, with a historic\n        commitment to the cause of protecting our Nation’s natural\n        heritage from man’s depredations. But if a “special interest”\n        in this subject were enough to entitle the Sierra Club to\n        commence this litigation, there would appear to be no\n        objective basis upon which to disallow a suit by any other\n        bona fide “special interest” organization, however small or\n        short-lived. And if any group with a bona fide “special\n        interest” could initiate such litigation, it is difficult to perceive\n        why any individual citizen with the same bona fide special\n        interest would not also be entitled to do so.\n\n405 U.S. at 739-40.\n\f                                 20\n\nor organizational plaintiffs.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n      Because we hold that Appellants lack standing to challenge\nthe Secretary’s selection of committee members, this Court and\nthe District Court lack jurisdiction to hear Appellants’ claims.\nAnd because we have already recognized our lack of\njurisdiction, we will not consider whether the No Child Left\nBehind Act incorporates the Negotiated Rulemaking Act’s § 570\nbar on judicial review of committee formation. “Without\njurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.\nJurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to\nexist, the only function remaining to the court is that of\nannouncing the fact and dismissing the cause.” Ex parte\nMcCardle, 74 (7 Wall.) 506, 514 (1868), quoted in Steel Co. v.\nCitizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).\n\n     We affirm the District Court’s judgments of dismissal.\n\f      EDWARDS, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment in\npart: The No Child Left Behind Act (“NCLBA” or “Act”), Pub.\nL. No. 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425 (2001) (relevant sections\ncodified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301-6578 (Supp. I 2001)), was enacted\nto enhance the educational opportunities of all children and\nensure their ability to meet challenging academic standards. The\nAct permits schools to exercise “greater decisionmaking\nauthority . . . in exchange for greater responsibility for student\nperformance,” 20 U.S.C. § 6301(7), as monitored through state\ntesting and accountability systems that comply with specific\nstandards set out in 20 U.S.C. § 6311. Students in schools that\nconsistently fail to meet target performance levels are entitled to\nsupplemental educational services and the option to transfer to\nother public schools. Id. § 6316.\n\n     The Act envisions parents as an integral part of achieving\nhigh-quality results and provides for parental participation from\nthe inception of the implementing regulations through the\ndevelopment of state plans regarding assessments and\naccountability systems. See id. §§ 6571, 6311. To implement\nthe NCLBA, the Secretary of Education (“Secretary”) is\nrequired to “establish a negotiated rulemaking process on, at a\nminimum, standards and assessments,” id. § 6571(b)(3)(A), and\n“select individuals to participate in such process . . . in such\nnumbers as will provide an equitable balance between\nrepresentatives of parents and students and representatives of\neducators and education officials,” id. § 6571(b)(3)(B).\n\n     Rachelle Lindsey is a parent of two children who attend a\nschool that has been identified as a “school in need of\nimprovement” under the NCLBA.            She alleges that the\nDepartment of Education (“Department”) failed to observe the\n“equitable balance” requirement of § 1901 of the NCLBA, 20\nU.S.C. § 6571, in selecting the members to participate in the\nnegotiated rulemaking process. In particular, she contends that\nthis Committee did not include an adequate number of\nrepresentatives of parents and students. She also contends that\n\f                               2\n\nthe implementing regulations, which originated with the\nCommittee, have placed at risk her children’s capacity to obtain\nthe full benefits of the Act.\n\n     Two questions are presented on this appeal. The first\nquestion is whether any challenge to the composition of the\nCommittee is subject to judicial review. The second question is\nwhether any of the appellants in this case have standing to\npursue such a challenge. I believe that the District Court erred\nin holding that judicial review of the Committee’s composition\nis barred; however, on the record at hand, I find that appellants\nlack standing to bring this case.\n\nI.   THE SECRETARY’S SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS FOR          THE\n     NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING PROCESS PRESCRIBED BY            THE\n     NCLBA IS CLEARLY SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n    The Department asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction\nover appellants’ claims, because judicial review is barred. In\nadvancing this contention, the Department argues that the\nNCLBA incorporates § 570 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act,\nwhich provides in part:\n\n     Any agency action relating to establishing, assisting, or\n     terminating a negotiated rulemaking committee under this\n     subchapter shall not be subject to judicial review. Nothing\n     in this section shall bar judicial review of a rule if such\n     judicial review is otherwise provided by law.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 570 (2000). The Department’s argument is entirely\nwithout merit. The NCLBA does not incorporate § 570 of the\nNegotiated Rulemaking Act. And, even if it did, § 570 does not\nbar review of the present suit.\n\f                               3\n\n     The NCLBA plainly does not incorporate the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act in its totality. Indeed, the NCLBA mandates a\nnegotiated rulemaking process, see 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3),\nwhile the Negotiated Rulemaking Act leaves the decision\nwhether to engage in such process to the discretion of the\nagency, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 563, 565 (2000). The NCLBA also\nprescribes particular steps for selecting participants in the\nnegotiated rulemaking process, see 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3),\nwhereas the Negotiated Rulemaking Act has no such\nprescriptions. The NCLBA only looks to the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act to guide the “process” of negotiated\nrulemaking. This is apparent from the language and structure of\nthe relevant provisions of the two acts.\n\n     The NCLBA directs the Secretary to establish a negotiated\nrulemaking process, 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3)(A), and to “select\nindividuals to participate in such process . . . in such numbers\nas will provide an equitable balance between representatives of\nparents and students and representatives of educators and\neducation officials,” 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3)(B) (emphasis\nadded). The next paragraph of § 6571, titled “Process,” explains\nthat “[s]uch process – . . . shall not be subject to the Federal\nAdvisory Committee Act, but shall otherwise follow the\nprovisions of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990.” 20\nU.S.C. § 6571(b)(4)(B). Thus, § 6571 first prescribes that the\nSecretary establish a negotiated rulemaking process and\nprovides instructions for the selection of persons to participate\nin that process. It then directs that the process of negotiated\nrulemaking shall follow the prescriptions of the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act, such as the consensus requirement contained\nin 5 U.S.C. § 566 (2000). It is therefore clear that, under the\nNCLBA, questions concerning the selection of the Committee\nare completely distinct from how the Committee members\nparticipate in the negotiated rulemaking process. Judicial\n\f                                 4\n\nreview is foreclosed only with respect to the process of\nnegotiated rulemaking.\n\n     Furthermore, nothing in the language, structure, or\nlegislative history of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act purports to\nbar judicial review of procedural requirements imposed by other\nstatutes. In fact, it expressly states the opposite. First, § 570 of\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act is explicit that “[a]ny agency\naction relating to establishing . . . a negotiated rulemaking\ncommittee under this subchapter shall not be subject to judicial\nreview.” 5 U.S.C. § 570 (emphasis added). The NCLBA\nCommittee is not established “under [the] subchapter” in which\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act is located. Indeed, establishing\na negotiated rulemaking committee “under [that] subchapter” is\na discretionary act, 5 U.S.C. § 565, which follows consideration\nof multiple factors enumerated at 5 U.S.C. § 563(a). In contrast,\nestablishing the Committee under the NCLBA is mandatory, and\nmust follow specific steps contained in 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3).\nClearly, then, the Committee established under 20 U.S.C. §\n6571(b)(3) is not a committee established under the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act.\n\n     Second, where, as here, review of an alleged procedural\nviolation in the context of final rule review is permitted by the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the savings clause of §\n570 explicitly permits such review: “Nothing in this section\nshall bar judicial review of a rule if such judicial review is\notherwise provided by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 570. The legislative\nhistory of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act is explicit that the\nsavings clause of § 570 was intended to preserve rights available\nunder the APA. The Senate Report states:\n\n    Persons wishing to challenge a rule derived from the work\n    of a negotiated rulemaking committee would retain all\n\f                                5\n\n    rights they presently possess under the APA to obtain\n    judicial review of that rule.\n\n         [The bill] recognizes and maintains the long tradition\n    in federal administrative law which authorizes judicial\n    review of agency rules at the time those rules are\n    promulgated. The bill merely precludes judicial\n    intervention in the earlier stages of the regulatory process,\n    when a negotiated rulemaking is underway.\n\nS. REP . NO. 101-97, at 28 (1989). Contrary to the District\nCourt’s analysis, the House Report is also consistent with this\ninterpretation. It explains that “[a]gency decisions to establish\na negotiated rulemaking committee or regarding the makeup of\nthis [sic] membership are not subject to judicial review.” H.R.\nREP . NO. 101-461, at 15 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n6697, 6706. It makes perfect sense that discretionary decisions\nwhether to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee under\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act are nonreviewable. This says\nnothing about the reviewability of binding directives to establish\nsuch committees under other statutes.\n\n     The District Court’s misunderstanding of the relationship\nbetween the NCLBA and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act stems\nin part from its peculiar phrasing of the question presented. The\ncourt considered whether § 570’s bar on judicial review lapses\nwhen final rules are promulgated, and identified tension between\nthe plain language of § 570 and a temporal limitation on the\nprohibition of judicial review; it also expressed concern that\nreading the prohibition contained in the first sentence of § 570\nas lapsing when final rules are promulgated renders § 570\nsuperfluous because the APA already bars review prior to final\nagency action. See Ctr. for Law & Educ. v. United States Dep’t\nof Educ., 315 F. Supp. 2d 15, 32-33 (D.D.C. 2004). The\nproperly framed question, however, is whether the savings\n\f                               6\n\nclause of § 570 permits review under the APA, which grants\njurisdiction to review a final agency action, and allows for\nreview of procedural violations at that time. See 5 U.S.C. §§\n704, 706(2)(D).\n\n     Approaching the issue in this way alleviates the District\nCourt’s concerns. First, the plain language of the savings clause\nis consistent with permitting review under the APA. Second,\ntriggering the savings clause does not render the first part of §\n570 superfluous. Indeed, intermediate agency action pursuant\nto the Negotiated Rulemaking Act remains unreviewable under\nthe APA because of the first part of § 570, which provides a\nclear statement barring judicial review of alleged violations of\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act, thereby overcoming the APA’s\npresumption of reviewability. There also is no basis for\nattacking regulations produced under the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act unless another statute expressly creates such a\nbasis.\n\n     In sum, nothing in § 570 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act\nproscribes review of procedures mandated by the NCLBA for\nestablishing the Committee. Even if § 570 were improbably\nconstrued to have such meaning, it is evident from the language\nand structure of § 1901 of the NCLBA that the Act incorporates\nprovisions of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act only to the extent\nthat those provisions determine the process of an already\nestablished Committee. Such a construction clearly prevents §\n570 from determining reviewability in this case.\n\nII.   APPELLANTS HAVE NO STANDING\n\n    Although there is no statutory bar to judicial review of this\ncase, we nonetheless lack jurisdiction over this matter because\nappellants have no standing.\n\f                                  7\n\n      In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that (1) she has suffered an injury-in-fact, (2) which\nis fairly traceable to the defendant’s purported unlawful conduct,\nand is not the result of an independent action of a third party not\nbefore the court, and (3) is likely to be redressed by a favorable\ndecision of the court. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n555, 560-61 (1992). In Defenders of Wildlife, the Supreme\nCourt fortified standing doctrine. It provided for precise notions\nof injury-in-fact grounded in concrete and imminent harm and\nof redressability rooted in an uninterrupted causal chain. See id.\nat 562-71. It is especially significant, therefore, that Defenders\nof Wildlife simultaneously embraced an expansive view of\nstanding in the context of procedural rights: “[S]o long as the\nprocedures in question are designed to protect some threatened\nconcrete interest of [the plaintiff’s],” id. at 573 n.8, “[t]he person\nwho has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete\ninterests can assert that right without meeting all the normal\nstandards for redressability and immediacy,” id. at 572 n.7. In\nother words, “‘procedural rights’ are special.” Id. This is\nbecause they are prophylactic in nature. Such requirements\nreflect Congress’s reasonable judgment that a government\ndecision will better protect particular interests with the specified\nprocedures in place.\n\n      Consistent with the unique role of procedural rights in\ncontemporary statutory schemes, a procedural rights plaintiff\nmust establish that (1) the procedural requirement was designed\nto guard her concrete interests; and (2) the government conduct,\nperformed in the absence of that procedure, will cause a distinct\nrisk to her particularized interests.\n\n     In applying these principles to the instant case, I concur in\nthe judgment that the organizational plaintiffs lack standing to\npursue their claims.         The majority opinion needs no\namplification on this point.\n\f                                8\n\n     The question whether Lindsey has standing to seek judicial\nenforcement of her alleged procedural right to a properly\nconstituted Committee raises a much harder issue. There is not\nthe slightest doubt in the record that this procedural requirement\nwas intended to protect parents’ voices on the Committee; and\nLindsey contends that the disputed regulations, which allegedly\noriginated in the absence of adequate parental representation,\nhave placed at risk her interest in ensuring that her children are\nproperly assessed so as to receive the full benefits of the\nNCLBA.\n\n     The District Court concluded that Lindsey failed to\nestablish an injury-in-fact because the language of § 1901 does\nnot “expressly bestow upon any person an individual right to\nenforce his or her construction of an ‘equitably balanced’\nnegotiated rulemaking committee.” Ctr. for Law & Educ., 315\nF. Supp. 2d at 27. This holding is clearly wrong. Because\nLindsey brings this suit under the APA, not the NCLBA, the\nstanding inquiry does not turn on rights enforceable\nindependently from the APA, but rather on an independent\nsource of procedural protection – here, § 1901 of the NCLBA –\nand a risk to concrete interests protected by the procedural\nrequirement.\n\n      I also disagree with the statement in the majority opinion\nsuggesting that, in procedural rights cases, “[o]utside of\nincreased exposure to environmental harms, hypothesized\n‘increased risk’ has never been deemed sufficient ‘injury’” to\nsatisfy standing requirements. In my view, this statement is not\nconsistent with the applicable case law. Most recently, in\nElectric Power Supply Ass’n v. FERC, No. 03-1182, 2004 WL\n2828047 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 10, 2004), we held that the Electric\nPower Supply Association (“EPSA”) had standing “to enforce\nprocedural requirements designed to protect [its] concrete\ninterest in the outcome of hearings to which [it was] a party.”\n\f                                9\n\nId. at *5. Specifically, EPSA had standing to challenge FERC’s\nnew exemptions regarding ex parte communications even\nthough there was no guarantee that impermissible ex parte\ncontacts would in fact materialize:\n\n    In complaining that the market monitor exemption violates\n    the Sunshine Act, EPSA is seeking to enforce procedural\n    requirements designed to protect EPSA’s concrete interest\n    in the outcome of hearings to which EPSA is a party. That\n    being the case, EPSA’s standing is not defeated by the fact\n    that it cannot show, with any certainty, that its or its\n    members’ financial interests will be damaged by the\n    operation of the [rule limiting the proscription against ex\n    parte communications in agency hearings].\n\nId. The holding of Electric Power follows the well-established\nlaw of this circuit. See id. at *6.\n\n      As noted above, there is no doubt that a “person who has\nbeen accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests\ncan assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for\nredressability and immediacy.” Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\nat 572 n.7. However, “in cases involving alleged procedural\nerrors, the plaintiff must show that the government act\nperformed without the procedure in question will cause a\ndistinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff.” Wyo.\nOutdoor Council v. United States Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 51\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nLindsey has failed to do this. The injury that she alleges is so\nattenuated that she fails to demonstrate that “the procedural\nviolation endangers a concrete interest . . . (apart from [her]\ninterest in having the procedure observed).” Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 573 n.8.\n\f                               10\n\n      This court looks to a two-part nexus to establish the\nrequisite relationship between the alleged procedural\nirregularity, the substantive government decision, and the\nconcrete interests of the procedural rights plaintiff. Consistent\nwith the prophylactic nature of procedural rights, a litigant\nseeking to enforce such rights must, first, show that the omitted\nprocedure is linked to a substantive government decision or act,\nsee City of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 234 (D.C. Cir.\n2003) (per curiam), and, second, “that the government act\nperformed without the procedure in question will cause a\ndistinct risk to [her] paricularized interest,” Wyo. Outdoor\nCouncil, 165 F.3d at 51 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Procedural requirements serve their prophylactic\nfunction irrespective of whether the ultimate Government\ndecision is consistent with views that emerge through the\nrequisite process. Thus, under the first part of the causal nexus\nrequirement, “[a] plaintiff who alleges a deprivation of a\nprocedural protection to which he is entitled never has to prove\nthat if he had received the procedure the substantive result\nwould have been altered. All that is necessary is to show that\nthe procedural step was connected to the substantive result.”\nSugar Cane Growers Coop. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 94-95\n(D.C. Cir. 2002). Lindsey’s problem lies not with this first\nprong, but the second. She has failed to establish any causal\nrelationship between the substantive Government decision that\nshe desires and a concrete, personal interest.\n\n     Lindsey is a parent of two children who attend John Foster\nDulles Elementary School, a public school in Chicago that has\nbeen identified as a “school in need of improvement” under the\nNCLBA. She contends that the Department violated her\nprocedural right to equitable representation on the Committee,\nand that the Department’s implementing regulations, which\noriginated in the allegedly improperly constituted Committee,\nincrease the risk that her children will be incorrectly assessed\n\f                               11\n\nand therefore denied the full benefits of the NCLBA. See Ctr.\nfor Law & Educ., 315 F. Supp. 2d at 26, 29 (citing Pls.’ Opp’n).\nLindsey, however, does not contend that the disputed regulations\nviolate the NCLBA. Indeed, at oral argument, Lindsey’s\ncounsel conceded that the regulations do not violate the statute.\nSee Recording of Oral Argument at 7:30-:40. Lindsey’s claim,\nthen, is that the regulations might have been qualitatively better\nif the Committee had been properly constituted and this might\nhave resulted in the state adopting qualitatively better\neducational assessment programs which, in turn, might have\nbenefitted her children.\n\n      Lindsey’s argument cannot succeed. First, it is far from\nclear that she has demonstrated a cognizable concrete interest\nsufficient to satisfy Article III standing. Second, even assuming\nthat her interest in her children’s education has some content\nthat makes it sufficiently concrete to be cognizable, she has\nfailed to demonstrate that there is any causal relationship\nbetween the disputed regulations and her asserted interest. In\nshort, Lindsey has failed to show that the alleged procedural\nviolation endangers a concrete interest apart from her interest in\nhaving the procedure observed. I therefore agree with the\nmajority that she lacks standing.\n\f",

Appellants contend that\nthey have standing to pursue their challenges, and that the Act\ndoes not bar judicial review of the Secretary of Education’s\nchoice of committee members. Because we agree with the\nDistrict Court’s holding that Appellants lack standing to pursue\ntheir claims, we affirm the judgments of the court. Moreover,\nbecause this Court concludes that it lacks Article III jurisdiction\nover this case, it does not consider the alternate issue of whether\njudicial review is barred by the Act.\n\n                         I. Background\n\n    A. The No Child Left Behind Act\n\n     On January 8, 2002, the President signed into law the “No\nChild Left Behind Act” (“NCLBA” or “the Act”). Pub. L. No.\n107-110, 115 Stat. 1425, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq.\nThe Act requires each State to implement statewide\naccountability systems for all public schools and their students,\nto define education standards, and to establish a system of\nassessments for measuring whether students have met those\nstandards. 20 U.S.C. § 6311. Under the Act, a school’s\n\f                                 3\n\ncontinued failure to make adequate yearly progress toward\nmeeting proficiency goals will give rise to assistance and\nintervention, with parents of students in failing schools allowed\nto transfer their children to better schools. Id. at § 6316(b).\n\n     The Act authorizes the Department of Education (“DOE”)\nto adopt regulations for the oversight of States’ design of\nstandards and assessments. 20 U.S.C. § 6571. In order to\n“ensure that final regulations are issued by the Secretary not\nlater than” January 8, 2003, id. at § 6571(b)(4)(A), Congress\ndirected the Secretary to utilize a “negotiated rulemaking\nprocess.” Id. at § 6571(b)(3)(A).\n\n      The framework for promulgating and adopting regulations\nunder the Act is laid out with specificity. First, the Secretary of\nEducation is to “obtain the advice and recommendations” of\nvarious interest groups. Id. at § 6571(b)(1). Second, the\nSecretary shall “establish a negotiated rulemaking process” for\nthe purpose of drafting regulations, id. at § 6571(b)(3)(A), and\nselect individuals to participate in such process “from among\nindividuals or groups that provided advice and recommendations\n. . . in such numbers as will provide an equitable balance\nbetween representatives of parents and students and\nrepresentatives of educators and education officials . . . .” Id. at\n§ 6571(b)(3)(B). Finally, “[s]uch process” shall be conducted\nbefore January 8, 2003. Id. at § 6571(b)(4)(A). The Secretary\nprovides draft regulations to committee members prior to their\nfirst meeting. Id. at § 6571(b)(3)(C). The process “shall not be\nsubject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, but shall\notherwise follow the provisions of the Negotiated Rulemaking\nAct of 1990 (5 U.S.C. 561 et seq.).” Id. at § 6571(b)(4).\n\n     This incorporation of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act\n(“NRA”) implicates jurisdictional concerns, as the NRA bars\njudicial review of “[a]ny agency action relating to establishing,\n\f                                 4\n\nassisting, or terminating a negotiated rulemaking committee\nunder this subchapter,” unless such review is otherwise provided\nby statute. 5 U.S.C. § 570. Section 6571(b)(4) does not\nexplicitly describe selection of committee members as being\nincluded in the “process” subject to the provisions of the NRA,\nbut it does not explicitly exclude member selection from the\n“process” subject to the NRA.\n\n   B.     Implementation         of   the    Act’s   Framework;\nContemporaneous Lawsuits\n\n      On January 18, 2002, DOE published a request for advice\nand recommendations in the Federal Register. 67 Fed. Reg.\n2770. On February 12, 2002, DOE issued an invitation for the\nsubmission of possible participants in the negotiated rulemaking.\nSee Email from Susan B. Neuman, Ed.D., Assistant Secretary of\nElementary and Secondary Education (Feb. 12, 2002), reprinted\nin Joint Appendix at 380-81. While the notice did stress that\n“[t]he nominees should be practitioners . . . [i.e.], they should be\nsignificantly involved with implementing and operating Title I\nprograms,” id., it also noted that the negotiated rulemaking was\nto include “representatives of Federal, State and local\nadministrators; parents; teachers and paraprofessionals;\nmembers of local school boards; and other organizations . . . .”\nId.\n\n     The committee convened by the Secretary consisted of 24\nmembers. According to the DOE, this body consisted of six\nrepresentatives of “State Administrators and State Boards of\nEducation,” four representatives of “Local Administrators and\nLocal School Boards,” four representatives of “Principals and\nTeachers,” seven representatives of “Students” (including one\nteacher, a few administrators, and a representative of a Diocese),\none representative of “Business Interests,” and two\nrepresentatives of the DOE. 67 Fed. Reg. 9223, 9224 (Feb. 28,\n\f                               5\n\n2002), corrected at 67 Fed. Reg. 9935 (Mar. 5, 2002). The\nparties do not specify whether any of the non-“parent”/\n“teacher” representatives are, themselves, parents or teachers.\nAppellants dispute the nominal makeup of this body. They\nclaim that “only one” member represented “the interests of all\npublic school parents and students,” because some\nrepresentatives actually stood in for “multiple perspectives.”\nBrief for Appellants at 11.\n\n      The February 28 notice gave individuals and groups who\n“felt that his or her interests [we]re not adequately represented\nby this . . . group” the opportunity to petition at the March 11\nmeeting, in person, to be seated as a negotiator. 67 Fed. Reg.\n9224. Plaintiff organization Designs For Change attempted to\npetition by phone to be seated (claiming that travel was\neconomically infeasible). The DOE declined to hear the\nphoned-in petition. Decl. of Weckstein, Joint Appendix at 121.\nAppellants assert that Center for Law and Education also\npetitioned to be seated, Brief for Appellant at 13, although no\nsuch petition is apparent from the record. Likewise, it is not\napparent that plaintiff Lindsey petitioned to be seated.\n\n     Appellants filed suit in District Court on March 8, 2002.\nThey alleged that the committee did not achieve “an equitable\nbalance between representatives of parents and students and\nrepresentatives of educators and education officials,” and sought\na preliminary injunction. While the suit was pending, the\ncommittee convened, reviewed the Secretary’s draft regulations,\nand reached consensus on every issue of academic standards and\nassessments before it. See 67 Fed. Reg. 30,452 (May 6, 2002).\nThe Secretary received the committee’s proposed rules, and\npublished them for public notice and comment. Id. During the\ncomment period, the DOE convened five regional meetings for\nfurther comment. Id.\n\f                                6\n\n      In May 2002, the District Court held that it lacked\njurisdiction over Appellants’ challenge on two grounds. First,\nit held that the NRA § 570 judicial-review bar precluded judicial\nreview of a challenge to the committee’s composition prior to\npromulgation of final rules. Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425268\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425268/center-for-law-and-educ-v-us-dept-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106-07 (D.D.C. 2002).\nThe court noted the plaintiffs’ argument that § 570 only applies\nto the “process” of committee deliberation, as 20 U.S.C. § 6571\nprovides that committee members would “participate in such\nprocess . . . .” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. at 107. But the court ultimately\nrejected this interpretation of “process” because of “the\nimplications of plaintiffs’ theory.”     Id.   Specifically, such\ninterpretation would require DOE to segregate the NCLBA into\n“process” and “non-process” provisions, and apply the NRA\naccordingly; the Court saw such segregation and selective\napplication to be implausible. Id. at 107-08. Moreover, to allow\nfor lawsuits over selection of committee members would make\ncompliance with the NCLBA’s strict time limits infeasible.\nId. at 108.\n\n    Second, the court held that review was unavailable under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), because selection of\nthe committee was not “final agency action.” Id. at 111.\nAppellants filed an appeal, which later was stayed at Appellants’\nrequest.\n\n     In July 2002, the DOE published its final rules on state\nstandards and assessments. 67 Fed. Reg. 45,038 (July 5, 2002)\n(to be codified at 34 C.F.R. pt. 200). The final rules took effect\non August 5, 2002. Id.\n\n     In December 2002, Appellants filed a new complaint. They\ndid not challenge the substance of the rules on traditional APA\ngrounds. See 5 U.S.C. § 706. Instead, they again focused on the\ncomposition of the committee, calling for the rules to be set\n\f                                7\n\naside and a new committee formed. On March 26, 2004, the\nDistrict Court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, holding\nthat Appellants lacked standing. Ctr. for Law and Educ. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403797\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403797/center-for-law-and-educ-v-us-dept-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2004). The court\nheld that DFC and CLE (“the organizational plaintiffs”) failed\nto demonstrate a procedural injury because the Act “contains no\nrequirement that advocacy groups be represented on the\nnegotiated rulemaking committee.” Id. at 23. The court also\nrejected the organizations’ standing on other grounds regarding\nlack of actual injury (i.e., the rules “do[] no more than arguably\noffend their policy goals,” id. at 24) and lack of causation (i.e.,\nthe alleged injury was not caused by the formation of the\ncommittee, but rather, by subsequent choices made by State\nagencies. Id. at 25). As to the individual plaintiff, Rachelle\nLindsey, the court held that because the Act created no\nenforceable right to have an equitably balanced committee,\nLindsey suffered no actual injury. The “risk” that her children\nwould not receive a high-quality education was too\n“hypothetical” and was dependant on the actions of the States,\nnot the DOE. Id. at 26-29. Finally, the court also held that\nincorporation of the NRA included incorporation of its bar on\njudicial review of the establishment of the negotiated\nrulemaking committee. Id. at 29-33.\n\n                          II. Analysis\n\n     This Court reviews de novo a dismissal for lack of standing.\nNat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v.

The Judicial Review Bar\n\n      As noted above, DOE raises two jurisdictional arguments:\nfirst, that Appellants lack Article III standing; and second, that\nCongress deprived this Court of jurisdiction to review the\ncomposition of the committee. Supra pages 3-4, 5-6. Because,\nas we discuss below, we hold that Appellants lack Article III\nstanding, we do not consider the question, never before raised in\nthis Court, of whether judicial review is barred in this matter.\nWe “need not identify every ground for holding that a claim is\nnot justiciable.” Fourth Branch Assocs.

Violation of a procedural right designed to protect\nplaintiffs’ interests\n\n    Appellants fail to show that a procedural right sufficient for\nstanding has been violated. Not all procedural-rights violations\nare sufficient for standing; a plaintiff must show that “the\nprocedures in question are designed to protect some threatened\nconcrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.”\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 573 n.8 (emphases added).\n\n     With respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the procedural\nrights at issue are clearly insufficient for standing, as the\nprocedures at issue were not designed to protect “some\nthreatened concrete interest of” the organizations. The No Child\nLeft Behind Act required the Secretary to “select individuals to\nparticipate in such process from among individuals or groups\n\f                                 10\n\nthat provided advice and recommendations, including\nrepresentation from all geographic regions of the United States,\nin such numbers as will provide an equitable balance between\nrepresentatives of parents and students and representatives of\neducators and educational officials.” 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3)(B).\nNowhere does the Act make mention of advocacy organizations’\ninterests.     The only interests arguably enjoying implicit\nprotection here are those of parents, students, educators and\neducation officials; although the advocacy groups may be\n“representatives” of parents and students, the interests to be\nprotected are those of the parents and students, not of the\norganizations.\n\n      Even in the case of the individual plaintiff, Lindsey, it is not\nat all clear that the Act’s procedures regarding the negotiated\nrulemaking process were “designed to protect” the interests of\nparents and students. The structure of § 6571 as a whole shows\nthat Congress manifestly did not endorse “protective” litigation\nregarding the formation of the committee amidst the time-\nlimited rulemaking process. The Act specifically mandated that\n“[s]uch [rulemaking] process shall be conducted in a timely\nmanner to ensure that final regulations are issued by the\nSecretary not later than 1 year after January 8, 2002[.]” 20\nU.S.C. § 6571(b)(4)(A). And, as noted above, the Act created\na complex process for crafting federal and state regulations that\nwould affect parents’ and students’ interests, including the Act’s\nprovision for the selection of an “equitable balance” of\ncommittee members. These provisions do not offer any promise\nof purposeful protection of the concrete interests of students and\nparents. Appellants cite the Conference Report for evidence that\n“Congress sought to ‘ensu[re] that the views of both program\nbeneficiaries and program providers are fairly heard and\nconsidered.’” Brief for Appellants at 9 (quoting H.R. CONF. REP .\n107-334, at 809, reprinted in 2001 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1230, 1352).\nThis is not persuasive evidence of protective design. To the\n\f                                11\n\nextent that the legislative history is relevant to the question\nbefore us, we note that the language of the report does not\nsupport Appellants’ position; if anything, it weighs against it:\n“The Conferees do not intend this language to require strict\nnumerical equality or comparability among these\nrepresentatives. Rather, the Conferees intend the Secretary to\nhave flexibility in selecting the [committee members.]” H.R.\nCONF. REP . 107-334 at 809.\n\n     With respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the NCLBA\nclearly did not create procedural rights designed to protect their\nconcrete interests. With respect to Lindsey, the NCLBA did not\nclearly create such a right; but as the next section of this\nstanding analysis makes clear, even if NCLBA did create such\na right, she has not suffered injury sufficient to establish\nstanding.\n\n         2. Injury to a concrete, particularized interest\n\n     Appellants present a variety of alleged “injuries” as a result\nof the Secretary’s selection of committee members. Appellants\nargue that the individual plaintiff, parent Rachelle Lindsey, has\nsuffered three injuries as a result of the Secretary’s selection of\ncommittee members: First, she was deprived of her procedural\nright to help shape the final rules. Brief for Appellants at 16.\nSecond, the final rules increased the “risk” that her children will\nbe denied the benefit of the best-possible education and those\nrules were caused by the committee selection. Id. at 17. Third,\nthe final rules fail to require States to provide for public\nparticipation in the creation of standards and measures under the\nAct, and those final rules were caused by the committee\nselection. Id.\n\n     Appellants also argue that the organizational plaintiffs have\nsuffered four injuries as a result of the Secretary’s selection of\n\f                                12\n\ncommittee members: First, the Secretary’s apportionment of\ncommittee seats among representatives of various interests\nreduced their chances of serving on the committee. Id. at 16.\nSecond, the selection excluded parent and student advocacy\norganizations from consideration. Id. Third, the final rules\nforced them to address advocacy issues on an expensive State-\nby-State basis. Id. at 17. Fourth, the final rules failed to require\nStates to provide for public participation. Id.\n\n      Taken together, Appellants allege four basic categories of\ninjuries:\n\n         (1) Injuries to Plaintiff Lindsey caused by the\n             final rules, following selection of the\n             committee members;\n\n         (2) Injuries to Plaintiff Lindsey caused by the\n             Secretary’s abridgment of her procedural\n             rights in the selection of committee members;\n\n         (3) Injuries to Plaintiff Organizations caused by\n             the final rules, following selection of the\n             committee members; and\n\n         (4) Injuries to Plaintiff Organizations caused by\n             the Secretary’s abridgment of their procedural\n             rights in the selection of committee members.\n\nTo organize Appellants’ alleged injuries in this fashion reveals\nwhat Appellants’ muddled brief obfuscates: Appellants allege\ntwo classes of injury under a Procedural Rights theory of\nstanding. Appellants allege injuries to Appellants’ procedural\nrights per se, and they allege injuries to their particularized\ninterests caused by the final rules. We consider these classes of\n\f                                   13\n\ninjuries in turn.1\n\n                a. Injury to their procedural interests\n\n     Appellants first allege that they suffered injury, as a result\nof the Secretary’s failure to abide by the procedures prescribed\nby the Act, to their interest in the government’s protection of\ntheir procedural rights.\n\n      As this Court sitting en banc described at length in Florida\nAudubon Society, a procedural-rights plaintiff must demonstrate\nstanding by “show[ing] not only that the defendant’s acts\nomitted some procedural requirement, but also that it is\nsubstantially probable that the procedural breach will cause the\nessential injury to the plaintiff’s own interest.” 94 F.3d at 664-\n65. In other words, while we relax the imminence and\nredressability requirements, the procedural-rights plaintiff must\nstill satisfy the general requirements of the constitutional\nstandards of particularized injury and causation. See id. at 664.\nAlthough Appellants rely heavily on footnote 7 of Lujan in\narguing procedural standing in this case, even in that case the\nCourt required a showing that “concrete interests” had been\ninvaded. 504 U.S. at 572 n.7.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n        Appellants do not argue that the organizational plaintiffs retain\n“representational standing” to press claims on behalf of individual\nmembers of the organization. Nonetheless, this Court notes in its own\njurisdictional inquiry that these organizational plaintiffs would not\nsatisfy the test for representational standing, because such plaintiffs\nwould need to show actual or imminent injury to their members\ncaused by the challenged action.

Seldin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 511\n(1975). As we discuss below, Appellants fail to show any such\ncausation here.\n\f                               14\n\n      Assuming arguendo that a procedural right designed to\nprotect a concrete interest of the Appellants has been violated\nhere, Appellants fail to demonstrate how they suffer actual\ninjury to a concrete, particularized interest, caused by the\nchallenged conduct. The chain of causation between the alleged\nprocedural violation and the concrete interest is speculative at\nbest.

See, e.g.,\nBrief of Appellants at 23 (“The Department’s denial of this right\nconstitutes sufficient injury to support standing.”). The two\nthings are not one and the same. Appellants must show both (1)\nthat their procedural right has been violated, and (2) that the\nviolation of that right has resulted in an invasion of their\nconcrete and particularized interest. “[A] prospective plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that the defendant caused the particularized\ninjury, and not just the alleged procedural violation.” Fla.\nAudubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664 (emphasis added). In Lujan the\nSupreme Court disclaimed Appellants’ conflation of concrete\ninterest and procedural right in unambiguous language:\n\n    If we understand this [argument] correctly, it means that the\n    Government’s violation of a certain . . . class of procedural\n    duty satisfies the concrete-injury requirement by itself,\n    without any showing that the procedural violation\n    endangers a concrete interest of the plaintiff (apart from his\n    interest in having the procedure observed). We cannot\n    agree.\n\f                                15\n\n504 U.S. at 573 n.8. Appellants must allege injury beyond mere\nprocedural misstep per se to satisfy standing in a procedural-\nrights case, and they fail to do so here.\n\n      In sum, we hold that Appellants have failed to show that the\nalleged procedural violation caused actual injury to Appellants’\nconcrete interests such that they satisfy Article III’s requirement\nof standing. Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664.\n\n              b. Injuries to other interests, caused by the final\nrules\n\n     Appellants allege injury not only to their procedural\ninterest, but also to their interests in education, lobbying, and\nother interests apart from procedural rights per se. Even\nassuming arguendo that their purported interests do constitute\nparticularized, concrete interests sufficient to satisfy Lujan, see\n504 U.S. at 560, Appellants fail to demonstrate the necessary\ncausal connection between the challenged agency action–here,\nthe promulgation of final rules–and the alleged injury.\n\n     To demonstrate standing, Appellants must show “a causal\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained\nof–the injury has to be ‘fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged\naction of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the\nindependent action of some third party not before the court.’”\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (quoting Simon, 426 U.S. at 41-42).\n\n     To show causation and redressability in their procedural-\nrights case, Appellants need not demonstrate that, but for the\nprocedural defect, the final outcome of the rulemaking process\nwould have been different, and that this Court’s ordering the\naction to remedy the procedural defect will alter the final effect\non Appellants’ interests. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7. In\nshort, this Court assumes the causal relationship between the\n\f                                  16\n\nprocedural defect and the final agency action. Nonetheless,\nAppellants must still demonstrate a causal relationship between\nthe final agency action and the alleged injuries.2\n\n     In the case of Lindsey, the agency action and the alleged\ninjury stand at opposite ends of a long chain: (1) DOE\npromulgated final rules giving discretion to the States to\nimplement their own rules for the education of children in the\nState; (2) the State of Illinois, in its discretion, implemented\nrules that were permitted but not required by DOE; (3) those\nrules increased the risk of improper evaluation of students and\nschools; (4) Lindsey’s daughter’s school might be improperly\nclassified as a result (though it presently receives federal\nfunding under the NCLBA); (5) Lindsey’s daughter might\nthereby be harmed by improper classification.\n\n     Having outlined the alleged causal chain, we conclude that\nthe connection between the beginning and end of the purported\nchain remains so attenuated that we cannot hold the alleged\n\n\n    2\n       We note that where, as here, the purported cause of injury (i.e.,\npromulgation of final rules) and the injury itself is separated by\nintervening actors and events, the causation and redressability\ninquiries may appear to merge.\n\n        In such cases, both prongs of standing analysis can be said to\n        focus on principles of causation: fair traceability turns on the\n        causal nexus between the agency action and the asserted\n        injury, while redressability centers on the causal connection\n        between the asserted injury and judicial relief. Despite these\n        similarities, however, each inquiry has its own emphasis.\n        Causation remains inherently historical; redressability\n        quintessentially predictive.\n\nFreedom Republicans v.

Where “the necessary elements of\ncausation and redressability . . . hinge on the independent\nchoices of the regulated third party,” i.e. the States, “it becomes\nthe burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those\nchoices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce\ncausation and permit redressability of injury.” Nat’l Wrestling\nCoaches Ass’n, 366 F.3d at 938 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Appellants fall far short of\ncarrying their burden.\n\n     Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the alleged injury\nto Lindsey is “concrete and particularized.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n560. Appellants allege direct injury styled as “increased risk,”\nin the form of giving the States the opportunity to injure\nAppellants’ interests. This so-called “injury” is insufficient for\nstanding.\n\n     Outside of increased exposure to environmental harms,\nhypothesized “increased risk” has never been deemed sufficient\n“injury.”3 And even if “risk” were sufficient injury for standing\nin the non-environmental context, Lindsey would have to show\n\n    3\n     We do not read Electric Power Supply Ass’n v. FERC, No. 03-\n1182, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2828047</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

That case dealt with standing to challenge\na federal agency’s arguably ultra vires publications of regulations\npurporting to authorize ex parte communications in violation of the\nSunshine Act, Pub. L. No. 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241 (1976). While in a\nsense a violation of rights protected by that statute could be called\nprocedural, in the final analysis, the violation supporting standing goes\nto substantive rights created under the Act. Electric Power Supply\nAssociation’s analysis of standing to assert those rights is not authority\nfor the general proposition of applicability of “enhanced risk” analysis\nto procedural violations in the determination of standing.\n\f                                18\n\nthat the challenged conduct has created a “demonstrably\nincreased risk” that “actually threatens the plaintiff’s particular\ninterests.” Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 667 (emphasis\nadded). Here, Lindsey has hypothesized that the final agency\nrules have increased the risk to her interests, but she has offered\nthis Court no actual demonstration of increased risk.\n\n     Indeed, were all purely speculative “increased risks”\ndeemed injurious, the entire requirement of “actual or imminent\ninjury” would be rendered moot, because all hypothesized, non-\nimminent “injuries” could be dressed up as “increased risk of\nfuture injury.”\n\n     With respect to the organizational plaintiffs, the causal\nchain between the challenged rules and the alleged injury is not\nso attenuated: The organizations allege that the Federal rules\nforce them to change their lobbying strategies, a more costly\nform of lobbying. But while their causal chain may be more\ntraceable than Lindsey’s, it fails to bind the challenged conduct\nto actual injury. This Court has not found standing when the\nonly “injury” arises from the effect of the regulations on the\norganizations’ lobbying activities (as opposed to the effect on\nnon-lobbying activities): “[C]onflict between a defendant’s\nconduct and an organization’s mission is alone insufficient to\nestablish Article III standing.

No. 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425 (2001) (relevant sections\ncodified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301-6578 (Supp. I 2001)), was enacted\nto enhance the educational opportunities of all children and\nensure their ability to meet challenging academic standards. The\nAct permits schools to exercise “greater decisionmaking\nauthority . . . in exchange for greater responsibility for student\nperformance,” 20 U.S.C. § 6301(7), as monitored through state\ntesting and accountability systems that comply with specific\nstandards set out in 20 U.S.C. § 6311. Students in schools that\nconsistently fail to meet target performance levels are entitled to\nsupplemental educational services and the option to transfer to\nother public schools. Id. § 6316.\n\n     The Act envisions parents as an integral part of achieving\nhigh-quality results and provides for parental participation from\nthe inception of the implementing regulations through the\ndevelopment of state plans regarding assessments and\naccountability systems. See id. §§ 6571, 6311. To implement\nthe NCLBA, the Secretary of Education (“Secretary”) is\nrequired to “establish a negotiated rulemaking process on, at a\nminimum, standards and assessments,” id. § 6571(b)(3)(A), and\n“select individuals to participate in such process . . . in such\nnumbers as will provide an equitable balance between\nrepresentatives of parents and students and representatives of\neducators and education officials,” id. § 6571(b)(3)(B).\n\n     Rachelle Lindsey is a parent of two children who attend a\nschool that has been identified as a “school in need of\nimprovement” under the NCLBA.            She alleges that the\nDepartment of Education (“Department”) failed to observe the\n“equitable balance” requirement of § 1901 of the NCLBA, 20\nU.S.C. § 6571, in selecting the members to participate in the\nnegotiated rulemaking process. In particular, she contends that\nthis Committee did not include an adequate number of\nrepresentatives of parents and students. She also contends that\n\f                               2\n\nthe implementing regulations, which originated with the\nCommittee, have placed at risk her children’s capacity to obtain\nthe full benefits of the Act.\n\n     Two questions are presented on this appeal. The first\nquestion is whether any challenge to the composition of the\nCommittee is subject to judicial review. The second question is\nwhether any of the appellants in this case have standing to\npursue such a challenge. I believe that the District Court erred\nin holding that judicial review of the Committee’s composition\nis barred; however, on the record at hand, I find that appellants\nlack standing to bring this case.\n\nI.   THE SECRETARY’S SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS FOR          THE\n     NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING PROCESS PRESCRIBED BY            THE\n     NCLBA IS CLEARLY SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n    The Department asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction\nover appellants’ claims, because judicial review is barred. In\nadvancing this contention, the Department argues that the\nNCLBA incorporates § 570 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act,\nwhich provides in part:\n\n     Any agency action relating to establishing, assisting, or\n     terminating a negotiated rulemaking committee under this\n     subchapter shall not be subject to judicial review. Nothing\n     in this section shall bar judicial review of a rule if such\n     judicial review is otherwise provided by law.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 570 (2000). The Department’s argument is entirely\nwithout merit. The NCLBA does not incorporate § 570 of the\nNegotiated Rulemaking Act. And, even if it did, § 570 does not\nbar review of the present suit.\n\f                               3\n\n     The NCLBA plainly does not incorporate the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act in its totality. Indeed, the NCLBA mandates a\nnegotiated rulemaking process, see 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3),\nwhile the Negotiated Rulemaking Act leaves the decision\nwhether to engage in such process to the discretion of the\nagency, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 563, 565 (2000). The NCLBA also\nprescribes particular steps for selecting participants in the\nnegotiated rulemaking process, see 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3),\nwhereas the Negotiated Rulemaking Act has no such\nprescriptions. The NCLBA only looks to the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act to guide the “process” of negotiated\nrulemaking. This is apparent from the language and structure of\nthe relevant provisions of the two acts.\n\n     The NCLBA directs the Secretary to establish a negotiated\nrulemaking process, 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3)(A), and to “select\nindividuals to participate in such process . . . in such numbers\nas will provide an equitable balance between representatives of\nparents and students and representatives of educators and\neducation officials,” 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3)(B) (emphasis\nadded). The next paragraph of § 6571, titled “Process,” explains\nthat “[s]uch process – . . . shall not be subject to the Federal\nAdvisory Committee Act, but shall otherwise follow the\nprovisions of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990.” 20\nU.S.C. § 6571(b)(4)(B). Thus, § 6571 first prescribes that the\nSecretary establish a negotiated rulemaking process and\nprovides instructions for the selection of persons to participate\nin that process. It then directs that the process of negotiated\nrulemaking shall follow the prescriptions of the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act, such as the consensus requirement contained\nin 5 U.S.C. § 566 (2000). It is therefore clear that, under the\nNCLBA, questions concerning the selection of the Committee\nare completely distinct from how the Committee members\nparticipate in the negotiated rulemaking process. Judicial\n\f                                 4\n\nreview is foreclosed only with respect to the process of\nnegotiated rulemaking.\n\n     Furthermore, nothing in the language, structure, or\nlegislative history of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act purports to\nbar judicial review of procedural requirements imposed by other\nstatutes. In fact, it expressly states the opposite. First, § 570 of\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act is explicit that “[a]ny agency\naction relating to establishing . . . a negotiated rulemaking\ncommittee under this subchapter shall not be subject to judicial\nreview.” 5 U.S.C. § 570 (emphasis added). The NCLBA\nCommittee is not established “under [the] subchapter” in which\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act is located. Indeed, establishing\na negotiated rulemaking committee “under [that] subchapter” is\na discretionary act, 5 U.S.C. § 565, which follows consideration\nof multiple factors enumerated at 5 U.S.C. § 563(a). In contrast,\nestablishing the Committee under the NCLBA is mandatory, and\nmust follow specific steps contained in 20 U.S.C. § 6571(b)(3).\nClearly, then, the Committee established under 20 U.S.C. §\n6571(b)(3) is not a committee established under the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act.\n\n     Second, where, as here, review of an alleged procedural\nviolation in the context of final rule review is permitted by the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the savings clause of §\n570 explicitly permits such review: “Nothing in this section\nshall bar judicial review of a rule if such judicial review is\notherwise provided by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 570. The legislative\nhistory of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act is explicit that the\nsavings clause of § 570 was intended to preserve rights available\nunder the APA. The Senate Report states:\n\n    Persons wishing to challenge a rule derived from the work\n    of a negotiated rulemaking committee would retain all\n\f                                5\n\n    rights they presently possess under the APA to obtain\n    judicial review of that rule.\n\n         [The bill] recognizes and maintains the long tradition\n    in federal administrative law which authorizes judicial\n    review of agency rules at the time those rules are\n    promulgated. The bill merely precludes judicial\n    intervention in the earlier stages of the regulatory process,\n    when a negotiated rulemaking is underway.\n\nS. REP . NO. 101-97, at 28 (1989). Contrary to the District\nCourt’s analysis, the House Report is also consistent with this\ninterpretation. It explains that “[a]gency decisions to establish\na negotiated rulemaking committee or regarding the makeup of\nthis [sic] membership are not subject to judicial review.” H.R.\nREP . NO. 101-461, at 15 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n6697, 6706. It makes perfect sense that discretionary decisions\nwhether to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee under\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act are nonreviewable. This says\nnothing about the reviewability of binding directives to establish\nsuch committees under other statutes.\n\n     The District Court’s misunderstanding of the relationship\nbetween the NCLBA and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act stems\nin part from its peculiar phrasing of the question presented. The\ncourt considered whether § 570’s bar on judicial review lapses\nwhen final rules are promulgated, and identified tension between\nthe plain language of § 570 and a temporal limitation on the\nprohibition of judicial review; it also expressed concern that\nreading the prohibition contained in the first sentence of § 570\nas lapsing when final rules are promulgated renders § 570\nsuperfluous because the APA already bars review prior to final\nagency action. See Ctr. for Law & Educ. v. United States Dep’t\nof Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403797\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403797/center-for-law-and-educ-v-us-dept-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32-33 (D.D.C. 2004). The\nproperly framed question, however, is whether the savings\n\f                               6\n\nclause of § 570 permits review under the APA, which grants\njurisdiction to review a final agency action, and allows for\nreview of procedural violations at that time. See 5 U.S.C. §§\n704, 706(2)(D).\n\n     Approaching the issue in this way alleviates the District\nCourt’s concerns. First, the plain language of the savings clause\nis consistent with permitting review under the APA. Second,\ntriggering the savings clause does not render the first part of §\n570 superfluous. Indeed, intermediate agency action pursuant\nto the Negotiated Rulemaking Act remains unreviewable under\nthe APA because of the first part of § 570, which provides a\nclear statement barring judicial review of alleged violations of\nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act, thereby overcoming the APA’s\npresumption of reviewability. There also is no basis for\nattacking regulations produced under the Negotiated\nRulemaking Act unless another statute expressly creates such a\nbasis.\n\n     In sum, nothing in § 570 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act\nproscribes review of procedures mandated by the NCLBA for\nestablishing the Committee. Even if § 570 were improbably\nconstrued to have such meaning, it is evident from the language\nand structure of § 1901 of the NCLBA that the Act incorporates\nprovisions of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act only to the extent\nthat those provisions determine the process of an already\nestablished Committee. Such a construction clearly prevents §\n570 from determining reviewability in this case.\n\nII.   APPELLANTS HAVE NO STANDING\n\n    Although there is no statutory bar to judicial review of this\ncase, we nonetheless lack jurisdiction over this matter because\nappellants have no standing.\n\f                                  7\n\n      In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that (1) she has suffered an injury-in-fact, (2) which\nis fairly traceable to the defendant’s purported unlawful conduct,\nand is not the result of an independent action of a third party not\nbefore the court, and (3) is likely to be redressed by a favorable\ndecision of the court. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560-61 (1992). In Defenders of Wildlife, the Supreme\nCourt fortified standing doctrine. It provided for precise notions\nof injury-in-fact grounded in concrete and imminent harm and\nof redressability rooted in an uninterrupted causal chain. See id.\nat 562-71. It is especially significant, therefore, that Defenders\nof Wildlife simultaneously embraced an expansive view of\nstanding in the context of procedural rights: “[S]o long as the\nprocedures in question are designed to protect some threatened\nconcrete interest of [the plaintiff’s],” id. at 573 n.8, “[t]he person\nwho has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete\ninterests can assert that right without meeting all the normal\nstandards for redressability and immediacy,” id. at 572 n.7. In\nother words, “‘procedural rights’ are special.” Id. This is\nbecause they are prophylactic in nature. Such requirements\nreflect Congress’s reasonable judgment that a government\ndecision will better protect particular interests with the specified\nprocedures in place.\n\n      Consistent with the unique role of procedural rights in\ncontemporary statutory schemes, a procedural rights plaintiff\nmust establish that (1) the procedural requirement was designed\nto guard her concrete interests; and (2) the government conduct,\nperformed in the absence of that procedure, will cause a distinct\nrisk to her particularized interests.\n\n     In applying these principles to the instant case, I concur in\nthe judgment that the organizational plaintiffs lack standing to\npursue their claims.         The majority opinion needs no\namplification on this point.\n\f                                8\n\n     The question whether Lindsey has standing to seek judicial\nenforcement of her alleged procedural right to a properly\nconstituted Committee raises a much harder issue. There is not\nthe slightest doubt in the record that this procedural requirement\nwas intended to protect parents’ voices on the Committee; and\nLindsey contends that the disputed regulations, which allegedly\noriginated in the absence of adequate parental representation,\nhave placed at risk her interest in ensuring that her children are\nproperly assessed so as to receive the full benefits of the\nNCLBA.\n\n     The District Court concluded that Lindsey failed to\nestablish an injury-in-fact because the language of § 1901 does\nnot “expressly bestow upon any person an individual right to\nenforce his or her construction of an ‘equitably balanced’\nnegotiated rulemaking committee.” Ctr. for Law & Educ., 315\nF. Supp. 2d at 27. This holding is clearly wrong. Because\nLindsey brings this suit under the APA, not the NCLBA, the\nstanding inquiry does not turn on rights enforceable\nindependently from the APA, but rather on an independent\nsource of procedural protection – here, § 1901 of the NCLBA –\nand a risk to concrete interests protected by the procedural\nrequirement.\n\n      I also disagree with the statement in the majority opinion\nsuggesting that, in procedural rights cases, “[o]utside of\nincreased exposure to environmental harms, hypothesized\n‘increased risk’ has never been deemed sufficient ‘injury’” to\nsatisfy standing requirements. In my view, this statement is not\nconsistent with the applicable case law. Most recently, in\nElectric Power Supply Ass’n v. FERC, No. 03-1182, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2828047</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. Dec. 10, 2004), we held that the Electric\nPower Supply Association (“EPSA”) had standing “to enforce\nprocedural requirements designed to protect [its] concrete\ninterest in the outcome of hearings to which [it was] a party.”\n\f                                9\n\nId. at *5. Specifically, EPSA had standing to challenge FERC’s\nnew exemptions regarding ex parte communications even\nthough there was no guarantee that impermissible ex parte\ncontacts would in fact materialize:\n\n    In complaining that the market monitor exemption violates\n    the Sunshine Act, EPSA is seeking to enforce procedural\n    requirements designed to protect EPSA’s concrete interest\n    in the outcome of hearings to which EPSA is a party. That\n    being the case, EPSA’s standing is not defeated by the fact\n    that it cannot show, with any certainty, that its or its\n    members’ financial interests will be damaged by the\n    operation of the [rule limiting the proscription against ex\n    parte communications in agency hearings].\n\nId. The holding of Electric Power follows the well-established\nlaw of this circuit. See id. at *6.\n\n      As noted above, there is no doubt that a “person who has\nbeen accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests\ncan assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for\nredressability and immediacy.” Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\nat 572 n.7. However, “in cases involving alleged procedural\nerrors, the plaintiff must show that the government act\nperformed without the procedure in question will cause a\ndistinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff.” Wyo.\nOutdoor Council v. United States Forest Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184751\"><a href=\"/opinion/184751/wy-outdoor-cncl-v-us-forest-svc/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nLindsey has failed to do this. The injury that she alleges is so\nattenuated that she fails to demonstrate that “the procedural\nviolation endangers a concrete interest . . . (apart from [her]\ninterest in having the procedure observed).” Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 573 n.8.\n\f                               10\n\n      This court looks to a two-part nexus to establish the\nrequisite relationship between the alleged procedural\nirregularity, the substantive government decision, and the\nconcrete interests of the procedural rights plaintiff. Consistent\nwith the prophylactic nature of procedural rights, a litigant\nseeking to enforce such rights must, first, show that the omitted\nprocedure is linked to a substantive government decision or act,\nsee City of Waukesha v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185864\"><a href=\"/opinion/185864/city-waukesha-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234 (D.C. Cir.\n2003) (per curiam), and, second, “that the government act\nperformed without the procedure in question will cause a\ndistinct risk to [her] paricularized interest,” Wyo. Outdoor\nCouncil, 165 F.3d at 51 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Procedural requirements serve their prophylactic\nfunction irrespective of whether the ultimate Government\ndecision is consistent with views that emerge through the\nrequisite process. Thus, under the first part of the causal nexus\nrequirement, “[a] plaintiff who alleges a deprivation of a\nprocedural protection to which he is entitled never has to prove\nthat if he had received the procedure the substantive result\nwould have been altered. All that is necessary is to show that\nthe procedural step was connected to the substantive result.”\nSugar Cane Growers Coop. v. Veneman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185684\"><a href=\"/opinion/185684/sugar-cane-growers-v-veneman-ann-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94-95\n(D.C. Cir. 2002). Lindsey’s problem lies not with this first\nprong, but the second. She has failed to establish any causal\nrelationship between the substantive Government decision that\nshe desires and a concrete, personal interest.\n\n     Lindsey is a parent of two children who attend John Foster\nDulles Elementary School, a public school in Chicago that has\nbeen identified as a “school in need of improvement” under the\nNCLBA. She contends that the Department violated her\nprocedural right to equitable representation on the Committee,\nand that the Department’s implementing regulations, which\noriginated in the allegedly improperly constituted Committee,\nincrease the risk that her children will be incorrectly assessed\n\f                               11\n\nand therefore denied the full benefits of the NCLBA. See Ctr.\nfor Law & Educ., 315 F. Supp. 2d at 26, 29 (citing Pls.’ Opp’n).\nLindsey, however, does not contend that the disputed regulations\nviolate the NCLBA. Indeed, at oral argument, Lindsey’s\ncounsel conceded that the regulations do not violate the statute.\nSee Recording of Oral Argument at 7:30-:40. Lindsey’s claim,\nthen, is that the regulations might have been qualitatively better\nif the Committee had been properly constituted and this might\nhave resulted in the state adopting qualitatively better\neducational assessment programs which, in turn, might have\nbenefitted her children.\n\n      Lindsey’s argument cannot succeed. First, it is far from\nclear that she has demonstrated a cognizable concrete interest\nsufficient to satisfy Article III standing. Second, even assuming\nthat her interest in her children’s education has some content\nthat makes it sufficiently concrete to be cognizable, she has\nfailed to demonstrate that there is any causal relationship\nbetween the disputed regulations and her asserted interest. In\nshort, Lindsey has failed to show that the alleged procedural\nviolation endangers a concrete interest apart from her interest in\nhaving the procedure observed. I therefore agree with the\nmajority that she lacks standing.\n\f</pre>",
