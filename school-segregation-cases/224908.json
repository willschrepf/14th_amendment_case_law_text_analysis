CAFESJIAN, et al.,\n\n    Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                      (May 9, 2011)\n\n       The above-captioned consolidated actions involve a series of claims and counterclaims\n\nrelating to the parties’ attempts to create a museum and memorial in Washington, D.C. devoted\n\nto the Armenian Genocide.1 Following a twelve-day bench trial in November 2010, the Court\n\nissued a Memorandum Opinion setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law on\n\nJanuary 26, 2011. See [193]2 Mem. Op. (Jan. 26, 2011). The Court found that none of the\n\nparties’ substantive claims were meritorious and dismissed all of the claims save one, holding\n\nthat Defendants Gerard L. Cafesjian (“Cafesjian”) and John J. Waters (“Waters”) were entitled to\n\nindemnification from the Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial, Inc. (“AGM&M”) for\n\nlegal expenses incurred in defending claims asserted against them in their capacities as former\n\nofficers of AGM&M. The Court also upheld the validity of a reversion clause in a Grant\n\n\n       1\n          As the Court has previously noted, the use of the term “genocide” to describe the\natrocities that befell the Armenians between 1915 and 1923 is not without controversy. The\nCourt employs the term used as by the parties, and the Court expresses no opinion on the\npropriety of that label.\n       2\n           All docket numbers refer to Civil Action No. 08-255.\n\fAgreement executed between Defendants Cafesjian and the Cafesjian Family Foundation, Inc.\n\n(“CFF”) and Plaintiff Armenian Assembly of America, Inc. (the “Assembly”), ruling that CFF\n\nand Cafesjian may exercise their rights under that clause effective December 31, 2010. The\n\nCourt asked the parties to submit additional briefing regarding two issues left unresolved by the\n\nCourt’s prior Memorandum Opinion: (1) whether CFF should be required to reimburse AGM&M\n\nfor part of the value of properties that shall be transferred to CFF under the terms of the Grant\n\nAgreement; and (2) the amount of legal expenses for which Cafesjian and Waters are entitled to\n\nbe indemnified. The parties have now completed the additional briefing on these issues as\n\nordered by the Court, and these issues are ripe for the Court’s resolution. This Memorandum\n\nOpinion contains the Court’s final findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to these\n\nissues. The parties have also filed a series of papers with the Court regarding the terms on which\n\nthe properties must be transferred to CFF. The Court shall address these filings in the context of\n\naddressing the reimbursement issue.\n\n       Pending also before the Court are several additional motions filed by Defendants\n\nCafesjian, Waters, and CFF (collectively, “Defendants”). First, Defendants have filed a [198]\n\nPetition for Involuntary Dissolution asking the Court to initiate procedures to involuntarily\n\ndissolve AGM&M under D.C. law. Second, Defendants have filed a [221] Motion Requesting\n\nAttorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation. Third, Defendants have filed a [214] Request for Order\n\nto Show Cause as to Why Plaintiffs Should Not Be Held In Contempt for allegedly violating one\n\nof this Court’s orders. The Assembly and AGM&M (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) have filed\n\noppositions to each of these motions, and Defendants have filed replies. In addition, Plaintiffs’\n\nformer counsel, K&L Gates LLP, has intervened and filed a brief opposing Defendants’ motion\n\n\n                                                 2\n\ffor attorneys’ fees for vexatious litigation. Accordingly, these motions are all ripe for resolution.\n\n       For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that the Grant Agreement does not\n\nimpose any obligation on CFF to reimburse AGM&M for the excess value of the properties over\n\nthe amount of the funds originally donated. Therefore, the Court shall enter final judgment on\n\nthis issue and order AGM&M to transfer the properties to CFF without further delay. With\n\nrespect to the amount of legal fees and expenses subject to the indemnification clause covering\n\nCafesjian and Waters, the Court shall refer this issue to a magistrate judge for a report and\n\nrecommendation. The Court shall deny-in-part Defendants’ motion requesting attorneys’ fees for\n\nvexatious litigation because Defendants have mostly failed to demonstrate that Plaintiffs or their\n\ncounsel acted recklessly or in bad faith; however, the Court shall hold in abeyance Defendants’\n\nmotion with respect to Plaintiffs’ untimely production of documents on the eve of trial. The\n\nCourt shall decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Defendants’ petition for\n\ninvoluntary dissolution of AGM&M, as this is a new claim asserted after trial that is best left to\n\nbe adjudicated by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Finally, the Court shall deny\n\nDefendants’ request for a show cause order because Defendants have not shown that Plaintiffs\n\nviolated one of this Court’s orders.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Court set out its factual findings thoroughly in its Memorandum Opinion issued on\n\nJanuary 26, 2011, and the Court assumes familiarity with that opinion and incorporates it here.\n\nSee Armenian Assembly of Am., Inc. v. Cafesjian, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2011 WL 229354\n\n(D.D.C. Jan. 26, 2011). The Court shall summarize the facts previously found by the Court to\n\nthe extent they are relevant to the issues remaining to be decided.\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       A.      Initial Interest in an Armenian Genocide Museum and the Acquisition of the\n               National Bank of Washington Building\n\n       In the late 1990s, Cafesjian and several individuals involved with the Assembly joined\n\nforces in an effort to create a museum devoted to memorializing the Armenian Genocide. On or\n\nabout April 1, 1996, Hirair Hovnanian (“Hovnanian”), one of the Assembly’s founders, made a\n\npledge of about $1.6 million to establish the Armenian National Institute (“ANI”) for the study,\n\nresearch, and affirmation of the Armenian Genocide. Dr. Rouben Adalian (“Adalian”), a\n\nhistorical researcher, was hired to become the director of ANI. Inspired by Hovnanian’s pledge,\n\nAnoush Mathevosian (“Mathevosian”) decided in 1996 to pledge $3 million to be used for the\n\npurpose of constructing a permanent museum in Washington, D.C. dedicated to the victims and\n\nsurvivors of the Armenian Genocide. In 1996, the Assembly began to explore properties in\n\nWashington, D.C. that would be suitable for a museum. Around this same time, Cafesjian was\n\nindependently planning to build a memorial to the Armenian Genocide. Through his trusted\n\nassociate Waters, Cafesjian contacted the Assembly and expressed an interest in potentially\n\nassociating his planned memorial with the Assembly’s museum project. Because Cafesjian had\n\nnot been involved in the Assembly, he invited Hovnanian, Adalian, and Robert Aram Kaloosdian\n\n(“Kaloosdian”), another of the Assembly’s founders, to meet with him and discuss the museum\n\nproject and the Assembly’s advocacy efforts. Cafesjian officially joined the Assembly as a\n\ntrustee in August 1998. At that point in time, Cafesjian and Waters continued to search\n\nseparately for a location for a memorial.\n\n       In or about late 1999, the Assembly identified the National Bank of Washington, located\n\nat 619 14th Street, NW, Washington, D.C., as a possible site for the museum. Although it was\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fmuch larger than the properties they had been looking at to date, everyone involved in the search\n\nwas impressed by the National Bank of Washington building (the “Bank Building”). The Bank\n\nBuilding has a prime location—just blocks from the White House—and its exterior and part of\n\nthe interior have been designated as historic landmarks in the D.C. Inventory of Historic Sites\n\nand the National Register of Historic Places. The property on which the Bank Building is located\n\nalso includes a vacant back lot which would allow for the construction of an annex. Cafesjian\n\nwas very interested in the Bank Building, and he dispatched Waters to do due diligence on the\n\nproperty. Because there was another interested buyer, Cafesjian directed Waters to work quickly\n\nto arrange the purchase. Cafesjian agreed to donate $3.5 million to the Assembly to create a\n\nconsolidated location at which the genocide museum, the genocide memorial, and offices for\n\nANI could be located. Anoush Mathevosian agreed to increase her pledge to $3.5 million to\n\nacquire the property.\n\n       The Assembly closed on the Bank Building on February 16, 2000, purchasing the\n\nbuilding for $7.25 million. The funds for the purchase were comprised of a $3.5 million pledge\n\nfrom Mathevosian, a $2.5 million grant from CFF, and a $1 million grant from Cafesjian’s\n\nVanguard Charitable Endowment Program - Cafesjian Family Foundation Charitable Trust.\n\nBecause Mathevosian could not access funds in sufficient time to wire them to the Assembly\n\nprior to the closing, CFF provided the Assembly with a $4 million interest-free bridge loan to\n\ncover Mathevosian’s pledge and to complete the transaction. On March 8, 2000, after the\n\nAssembly had received Mathevosian’s pledged donation, the Assembly repaid CFF $3.5 million\n\nby wire transfer. On March 17, 2000, the Assembly executed a promissory note produced by and\n\nfor the benefit of CFF for the remaining $500,000.\n\n\n                                                5\n\f       After the closing, on February 28, 2000, Anoush Mathevosian wrote a letter to the\n\nAssembly restating the purpose of her pledge. The letter stated that the purpose of her gift was to\n\nfoster the development of an Armenian Genocide museum with educational exhibits, and\n\nMathevosian expressed her desire that the Bank Building be used solely for the Assembly, ANI,\n\nthe museum, and the memorial. She wrote:\n\n       To be certain that future generations remain true to the intent of our donations, it\n       should be clear that no changes will be made to the purpose and usage of the\n       Museum; that no mortgages are taken against the property and that the Museum’s\n       perpetuation is not jeopardized as such or encumbered in any way; and that there will\n       be no subsequent changes to the name of the museum.\n\nPX-110. At her deposition, Mathevosian explained that she wanted to ensure that they paid for\n\nthe property in full so that it would not be mortgaged or sold in the future. Mathevosian asked\n\nthat these understandings be incorporated into the permanent records of the organization.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Mathevosian’s expressed desires were ever formally\n\nincorporated by the Assembly into a binding obligation. Mathevosian testified that Hovnanian\n\nagreed to her conditions, but she did not recall whether he had done so orally or in writing. John\n\nWaters testified that he did not see Mathevosian’s letter until several years later, in late 2003. In\n\nany case, Mathevosian did not ask for a reversionary interest in her donation, and therefore she\n\ndoes not have one.\n\n       The parties agreed that as a condition of Cafesjian’s donation of funds for the purchase of\n\nthe Bank Building, the Assembly was required to include a memorial named after Cafesjian as\n\npart of the project. On March 30, 2000, the Assembly sent Cafesjian a letter confirming his\n\ndonations and its obligation to build a memorial. The Assembly agreed to cooperate with the\n\ndesign firm or artist chosen by CFF to complete the memorial. The anticipated completion date\n\n\n                                                  6\n\ffor the project was March 2002, and CFF agreed to make contributions to the Assembly to\n\nfinance the memorial. Because of the size of the Bank Building (34,000 sq. ft) and the property\n\non which it sits, it was contemplated that the Assembly and ANI would move out of their\n\nexisting offices when their lease expired in March 2002 and occupy space on the new site.\n\nAccordingly, it was agreed that the development of suitable office space on the property would\n\nbe a priority. Ross Vartian, then-Executive Director for the Assembly, testified at trial that in\n\nretrospect, they were naïve to think that the museum, the memorial, and offices for the Assembly\n\nand ANI could all be housed within the Bank Building.\n\n       B.      Acquisition of the Properties Adjacent to the Bank Building\n\n       Once the Bank Building was acquired by the Assembly, Cafesjian began to acquire\n\nproperties adjacent to the Bank Building. Ultimately, Cafesjian decided to donate the properties\n\nto the Assembly for the purpose of expanding the footprint of the museum project.\n\n       Cafesjian acquired four parcels adjacent to the Bank Building: (1) 1342 G Street, NW; (2)\n\n1340 G Street, NW; (3) 1338 G Street, NW; and (4) 1334-36 G Street, NW (collectively, the\n\n“Adjacent Properties”). Each of the properties was acquired in an arms-length transaction by one\n\nof Cafesjian’s entities, TomKat Limited Partnership (“TomKat”). TomKat executed an\n\nagreement to purchase 1338 G Street for $1.2 million on March 10, 2000 and closed on May 15,\n\n2000. TomKat purchased 1342 G Street for $1.2 million on March 16, 2000 and closed on\n\nSeptember 30, 2000. On October 24, 2000, TomKat entered into an Installment Purchase and\n\nSale Agreement to purchase 1340 G Street for a total of $3 million. Under the installment\n\nagreement, payments of $150,000 were due each year for a period of ten years, with a final\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fballoon payment of $1.5 million due in March 2011.3 The final adjacent property, 1334-46 G\n\nStreet, NW, also known as the “Families U.S.A.” building, was acquired later by TomKat, which\n\npurchased the building from a third-party seller for $6.5 million in September 2003.\n\n       C.      Initial Efforts to Develop the Museum and Memorial\n\n       A planning committee was formed to handle the task of developing the Bank Building\n\ninto a museum and memorial. The planning committee operated largely by consensus, and there\n\nwere about a dozen different individuals who became involved to varying degrees in the planning\n\nfor the project. Although the committee held several meetings in the spring of 2000 to discuss\n\ndevelopment plans and fundraising, there was no dedicated staff to shepherd the project along,\n\nand the lack of a central decision maker slowed the pace of progress considerably. In 2001, Ross\n\nVartian took on the position of planning director for the project, but the committee was unable to\n\nagree on critical decisions such as how to go about hiring professionals to work on the building\n\nand how to raise funds to cover the costs of construction and operation. The biggest obstacle was\n\ndisagreement over the size and scope of the project, including uncertainty over how Cafesjian’s\n\nacquisition of the Adjacent Properties would affect the development of the museum.\n\n       It was around late summer 2001 when Cafesjian agreed to donate the Adjacent Properties\n\nto be used for the genocide museum project. No official proposal was made to the Assembly\n\nuntil October 15, 2001, when Cafesjian wrote a letter to Hovnanian outlining the terms of a\n\nproposed grant of the three properties that had been acquired. This letter was the first in a series\n\nof draft grant agreements that would ultimately be exchanged between Cafesjian and the\n\n\n\n       3\n       In a Status Report filed on May 5, 2011, Defendants indicated that all payments had\nbeen made under the installment agreement and that title had been transferred to CFF.\n\n                                                  8\n\fAssembly. The letter proposed that Cafesjian and/or CFF donate $5.8 million to the Assembly to\n\npurchase the properties from TomKat. The proposed grant agreement would require the\n\nAssembly to use the properties solely as part of the genocide museum project, subject to plans\n\napproved by the Assembly’s planning committee. The letter also proposed that if the Assembly\n\nfailed to develop the property according to those plans, CFF would be entitled to a return of\n\neither the grant funds or the properties. Cafesjian expressed his frustration with the lack of\n\nprogress that had been made, and he explained at trial that he wanted to make certain that the\n\nmuseum was built during his lifetime.\n\n       Cafesjian’s proposal was generally well received at the Assembly, although the Assembly\n\nnever responded in writing to Cafesjian’s letter. However, there was no meaningful progress\n\nthroughout the rest of 2001. In 2002, the parties continued to discuss various development\n\nproposals and there was some progress. In March 2002, the Assembly determined that an\n\nindependent entity should be created to develop and operate the museum project. CFF and the\n\nAssembly also agreed to combine their conditions with prior gifting commitments, which the\n\nnewly-formed independent entity would be obliged to honor. CFF and the Assembly agreed to\n\njointly design and approve the governing documents for the new entity, which would become\n\nknown as the Armenian Genocide Museum & Memorial, Inc. (“AGM&M”). It was agreed that\n\nAGM&M would be incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization as soon as it was possible to do so\n\nresponsibly and sustainably. The parties also decided that the Assembly offices would not be\n\nhoused within any portion of the museum complex, in part to keep the museum independent from\n\nany advocacy organization and in part because it was thought that there would not be adequate\n\nspace in the complex for the Assembly. To ensure that the Assembly would get sufficient credit\n\n\n                                                 9\n\ffor launching the museum (and to combat the perception that the Assembly was abandoning the\n\nproject), Cafesjian and Hovnanian agreed to channel their contributions through the Assembly.\n\n       In August 2002, the planning committee met and discussed a revised draft grant\n\nagreement letter from CFF. Like the previous draft grant agreement sent in October 2001, it\n\ncontained a reversion clause stating that if the three adjacent properties were not developed in\n\naccordance with a plan approved by the AGM&M (with the necessary approval of CFF), CFF\n\nwould be entitled to a return of either those adjacent properties or the funds used to purchase\n\nthem. There was some discussion at the meeting that such an open-ended reversion clause would\n\nnot be appropriate.\n\n       The museum project was facing significant cash flow problems over the course of 2002,\n\nand Cafesjian had agreed to advance funds necessary for work to be completed in that year. In\n\nOctober 2002, the museum planning committee convened a meeting in New York and engaged in\n\nan extensive discussion about the finances for the project. Hovnanian expressed his concern that\n\nthey would be unable to raise enough money to fund a project with a $100 million budget, and he\n\nraised the possibility of phasing in the project, with later expansion tied to better economic\n\ncircumstances. Others also expressed concerns about the operating deficit. Waters told the\n\ncommittee that Cafesjian was optimistic that the funds could be raised from the community and\n\nthat, if necessary, Cafesjian was prepared to donate $50-75 million to ensure that the project was\n\ncompleted. According to one draft summary of the meeting, “[a]ll felt that G. Cafesjian’s\n\ncommitment, characterized as a ‘safety net,’ alleviated the fiscal concerns.” DX-67 at 2. The\n\nplanning committee members did reach some agreements about how best to move forward, but\n\nthe committee remained focused on consensus-based decision-making.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       On January 22, 2003, CFF sent a revised draft grant letter to the Assembly for review. As\n\nwith the previous drafts, the letter contained a reversion clause, but this time it contained a\n\ntriggering date: if the three donated adjacent properties were not developed according to plans\n\napproved by AGM&M by December 31, 2008, then those properties (or the cash used to acquire\n\nthem) would revert to CFF. The letter also provided that a new $500,000 promissory note would\n\nbe issued to CFF by the Assembly to replace the previous one, and that the obligation may be\n\ntransferred to AGM&M. The letter proposed that decisions of the AGM&M Board of Trustees\n\nbe decided by an 80% affirmative vote. This draft letter was discussed at a meeting in Delray,\n\nFlorida, where Hovnanian, Vartian, Kaloosdian, and Adalian were present. The Assembly Board\n\nof Trustees held another annual meeting in Boca Raton on March 1, 2003. By the time of this\n\nmeeting, everyone agreed that AGM&M should be launched as an independent entity with a\n\nbudget of around $100 million and a new building constructed on the Bank Building and the\n\nthree adjacent properties to be donated by Cafesjian. It was also agreed that ANI would retain its\n\nstatus as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, but that it would become a subsidiary of the new\n\nmuseum entity.\n\n       D.      Final Negotiation of the Grant Agreements and the Creation of AGM&M\n\n       It took seven months following the March 2003 meeting to finalize the agreements and\n\ngoverning documents that would create AGM&M. One reason for the delay was the acquisition\n\nof the fourth adjacent property, the Families U.S.A. building. Through TomKat, Cafesjian\n\nentered into a purchase agreement to buy the property for $6.5 million on September 22, 2003.\n\nThe closing date was scheduled for October 30, 2003.\n\n       The draft grant agreement from Cafesjian continued to be discussed and negotiated.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fBecause Cafesjian had agreed to channel his donations to AGM&M through the Assembly, it\n\nwas decided that Cafesjian would enter a grant agreement with the Assembly (hereinafter, the\n\n“Grant Agreement”), and the Assembly would transfer all of the museum-related assets and\n\nobligations to AGM&M in a separate agreement, to be known as the “Transfer Agreement.” The\n\nlaw firm of Caplin & Drysdale was hired to draft the Transfer Agreement as well as the organic\n\ndocuments for AGM&M, including the Articles of Incorporation, the By-Laws, and a Unanimous\n\nWritten Consent agreement signed by all of the initial trustees of AGM&M.\n\n       The record shows that the language in the Grant Agreement was reviewed by most of the\n\nmajor figures involved in AGM&M during the months leading up to its execution on November\n\n1, 2003. On October 13, 2003, Waters emailed an updated draft of the Grant Agreement, which\n\nincluded the donation of the Families U.S.A. building, for review. The revised draft also\n\nincluded a new trigger date of December 31, 2010 for the reversion clause; it was felt that seven\n\nyears was a reasonable timeline for the completion of the project. The reversion clause was also\n\nexpanded to cover the Bank Building in addition to the four Adjacent Properties. Because the\n\nFamilies U.S.A. building transaction was scheduled to close on October 30, Waters urged\n\neveryone to act expeditiously so that title to the building could be transferred directly to\n\nAGM&M, eliminating the need to transfer the property from TomKat to AGM&M and saving\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in transfer and recordation fees. On October 28, 2003, a\n\nconference call was held with, inter alia, Hovnanian, Cafesjian, Kaloosdian, Waters, and Vartian\n\nto discuss the four key documents: the Grant Agreement, the Articles of Incorporation for\n\nAGM&M, the AGM&M By-Laws, and the Unanimous Written Consent agreement. During this\n\nmeeting, Kaloosdian suggested that the language in the reversion clause in the Grant Agreement\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fbe clarified so as to avoid ambiguity about when the right of reversion might be triggered. The\n\nfinal language of these documents was approved shortly after this conference call.\n\n       The Court noted in its prior Memorandum Opinion that several individuals involved in\n\nthese discussions, including Kaloosdian and Hovnanian, had a convenient lack of memory with\n\nrespect to what transpired. Therefore, the Court relied heavily on documents that were submitted\n\nas exhibits to determine the events in question. The Court also noted that it appeared as if these\n\nindividuals did not take the time to fully understand the terms and conditions of the agreements.\n\nAny claim that these individuals had certain intentions with regard to these documents is\n\ndisingenuous and belied by the language of the documents themselves.\n\n       The Articles of Incorporation for AGM&M were signed on October 29, 2003, and\n\nAGM&M officially became incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws for AGM&M were ratified and adopted,\n\nrespectively, pursuant to the Unanimous Written Consent agreement, which was executed on\n\nOctober 30, 2003. The Grant Agreement and Transfer Agreement were signed on November 1,\n\n2003 during an Assembly gala in Palm Desert, California. Because the content of these\n\ndocuments is critically important to disputed issues in this litigation, the Court shall review each\n\nof these documents in some detail.\n\n               1.      The Grant Agreement\n\n       The Grant Agreement was signed by Cafesjian on behalf of himself and CFF and by\n\nHovnanian and Peter Vosbikian on behalf of the Assembly. See DX-2 (hereinafter, “Grant\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fAgreement”).4 The eleven-page document sets forth the terms and conditions of the grants made\n\nby Cafesjian and CFF to the Assembly for the museum project and obligates the Assembly to\n\ncomply with those terms and conditions.\n\n          Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, Cafesjian and/or CFF (jointly defined as the “Grantor”)\n\nagreed to donate $10.3 million for the purchase of the Adjacent Properties from TomKat and any\n\nrelated transaction costs. In addition, Cafesjian and/or CFF agreed to make the annual $150,000\n\npayments under the installment agreement for 1340 G Street and the final balloon payment of\n\n$1.5 million due in March 2011. See Grant Agreement §§ 2(D)-(E). The amounts paid under the\n\nGrant Agreement were calculated based on the purchase price paid by TomKat for the Adjacent\n\nProperties, plus the holding costs paid by TomKat pending transfer minus any rents earned\n\nduring this period, plus the legal costs associated with the transfer.\n\n          For purposes of this litigation, the most critical feature of the Grant Agreement is the\n\nreversion clause. Under § 3.1 of the Grant Agreement, the “Grant Property”—defined as the\n\nBank Building and the Adjacent Properties—“may only be used as part of the AGM&M,[5]\n\nsubject to plans for the AGM&M approved by the Board of Trustees of the American Genocide\n\nMuseum & Memorial, Inc. (the ‘Plans’) . . . .” Grant Agreement § 3.1(A). The next section\n\nreads as follows:\n\n          If the Grant Property is not developed prior to December 31, 2010 in accordance with\n          the Plans, or if the Grant Property is not developed in substantial compliance with the\n          Plans including with respect to the deadlines for completion of the construction,\n\n\n          4\n        A duplicate copy of this exhibit with some handwriting on the second page was\nadmitted as PX-112.\n          5\n              As used in this context, “AGM&M” refers to the museum project, not the corporate\nentity.\n\n                                                    14\n\f         renovation, installation and other phases detailed in the Plans, then:\n                (i)     in the event any portion of the Grants has not been funded, this\n                        Agreement terminates;\n                (ii)    to the degree any portion of the Grants has been funded, at the\n                        Grantor’s sole discretion, the Assembly shall return to the Grantor the\n                        Grant funds or transfer to the Grantor the Grant Property.\n\nId. § 3.1(B). The phrase “Grant funds” as referenced in the reversion clause includes both the\n\ninitial grant of $4 million that was used to acquire the Bank Building as well as the $12.85\n\nmillion pledged to acquire the Adjacent Properties. Cafesjian testified that the purpose of the\n\nreversion clause was to provide an incentive to complete the museum expeditiously, so that it\n\nmight be built before Cafesjian died. Waters testified that the reversion clause was most likely\n\nhis idea; he explained that CFF often inserted reversion clauses into its grant agreements.\n\nSection 3.3 of the Grant Agreement requires the Assembly to use the “Grant funds only for\n\npurposes described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.” Id.\n\n§ 3.3.\n\n         The Grant Agreement provides that the Assembly shall make available a space for a\n\nmemorial to be named the “Gerard L. Cafesjian Memorial” or another name approved by CFF,\n\nwhich shall be operated and maintained in perpetuity by the Assembly at its own cost. Grant\n\nAgreement § 3.2. The Grant Agreement also provides that neither CFF nor Cafesjian have any\n\nobligation to provide additional funding to the Assembly or to AGM&M. Id. § 3.8. The Grant\n\nAgreement also contains a breach clause:\n\n         (A)    If the Assembly fails to use the Grants solely for the purposes set out in this\n                Agreement or if the Assembly fails to satisfy any of the conditions of this\n                Agreement, Grantor is released from any remaining obligation under this\n                Agreement to provide funds or property to the Assembly.\n         (B)    If the Assembly uses any portion of the Grants either for a purpose other than\n                those set out in this Agreement or for a purpose other than those described in\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f               Section 501(c)(3) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, as amended, the Assembly\n               shall repay the portion of the Grants so spent to Grantor, plus interest.\n       (C)     The remedies set out in this Section 3.9 are in addition to any other remedies\n               that may be available to the Grantor at law or equity.\n\nGrant Agreement § 3.9.\n\n       The Grant Agreement also required the Assembly to enter into a Transfer Agreement with\n\nAGM&M to transfer all of its interest in all cash, pledges, property, and other assets being held\n\nby the Assembly for the museum project. Id. § 5.3(A). The Transfer Agreement would obligate\n\nAGM&M to honor all existing donor requirements at the time of transfer and to assume all\n\nobligations in the Grant Agreement relating to the Memorial. Id. § 5.3(B)-(C). The Grant\n\nAgreement also provided that the Assembly would assign its right to appoint the Trustees of the\n\nArmenian National Institute to AGM&M. Id. § 5.5.\n\n               2.      The Transfer Agreement\n\n       The Transfer Agreement was executed on November 1, 2003 by the Assembly and the\n\nnewly-incorporated AGM&M. See PX-114 (hereinafter, the “Transfer Agreement”). The\n\nTransfer Agreement requires the Assembly to contribute to AGM&M “all of its rights, title and\n\ninterest in and to all cash, pledges, real property, tangible property, intangible property, and other\n\nassets contributed to the [Assembly] and/or held by the [Assembly] for the development,\n\nrenovation, and construction of the AGM&M.” Id. § 1.1. The approximate aggregate value of\n\nthe grant was listed as $27.8 million, including $7.25 million in property, over $19 million in\n\npledges, and approximately $670,000 in cash and other assets. Id. § 1.1(C).\n\n       Pursuant to § 1.2 of the Transfer Agreement, “AGM&M, Inc. must honor all of the\n\n[Assembly]’s donor requirements existing at time of transfer, or in the alternative, obtain donor\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fconsent to the transfer and any modification of donor terms.” Transfer Agreement § 1.2(A). The\n\nagreement also explicitly requires AGM&M to comply with the obligation to construct a\n\nmemorial as set out in the Grant Agreement. Id. § 1.2(B). The Transfer Agreement also requires\n\nAGM&M to use the funds and property transferred “solely to develop, construct and operate” the\n\nArmenian Genocide Museum & Memorial. Id. § 1.3. The agreement also contains an arbitration\n\nclause. See Transfer Agreement § 5.3. However, as the Court noted in its prior Memorandum\n\nOpinion, none of the parties is presently seeking to enforce that arbitration clause.\n\n               3.      The AGM&M Articles of Incorporation\n\n       The Articles of Incorporation for AGM&M were executed on October 29, 2003. See PX-\n\n121. The Articles provide that AGM&M is a nonprofit corporation organized for charitable\n\npurposes within the meaning of § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Id., Art. IV(A). The\n\npurpose of the corporation is defined as, inter alia, “to own, operate, and maintain a permanent\n\nmuseum and memorial to the victims and survivors of the Armenian Genocide.” Id. The\n\nArticles provide that AGM&M has no members and that the board of directors for the\n\ncorporation shall be referred to as the Board of Trustees. See id., Arts. V-VI. The manner of\n\nelection or appointment to the Board of Trustees is to be set forth in the By-Laws of the\n\ncorporation. Id., Art. VI. The Board of Trustees must have at least three trustees at all times, and\n\nthe initial trustees are defined to be Gerard L. Cafesjian, Hirair Hovnanian, Anoush Mathevosian,\n\nand Robert Kaloosdian. Id., Art. IX. The Articles also provide that “[n]o part of the net earnings\n\nof the Corporation shall inure to the benefit of or be distributed to any trustee, employee or other\n\nindividual, partnership, estate, trust or corporation having a personal or private interest in the\n\nCorporation.” Id., Art. IV(C).\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f                4.      The AGM&M By-Laws\n\n        The By-Laws of AGM&M set out rules that govern the operation of the Board of\n\nTrustees. See PX-122 (hereinafter, “By-Laws”). The By-Laws provide that the term of office of\n\neach of the initial trustees (i.e., Cafesjian, Mathevosian, Hovnanian, and Kaloosdian) “shall be\n\nperpetual.” By-Laws § 2.4. Each donor that elected an initial trustee (CFF, Mathevosian,\n\nHovnanian, and the Assembly) is entitled to appoint a successor trustee in the event that the\n\ninitial trustee is unable to serve for any reason. Id. Additional trustees may be elected to the\n\nBoard of Trustees by making a contribution of $5 million to AGM&M, provided that the Board\n\nof Trustees has accepted the contribution by an 80% affirmative vote and the donor has\n\nappointed a successor. Id. § 2.5. Each donor (including initial donors) is entitled to one vote on\n\nthe Board of Trustees for each $5 million contributed. Id. §§ 2.4-2.5.\n\n        The By-Laws prohibit AGM&M from engaging in any activities or conduct that would\n\nnot be permitted to a corporation exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code. See By-Laws § 3.3. Similarly, the By-Laws provide that “[n]o part of\n\nthe net earnings shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, the Trustees, officers or others\n\nexcept that the Trustees shall be authorized and empowered, if they so elect, to pay to Trustees,\n\nofficers or others reasonable compensation for service rendered and to make payments and\n\ndistribution in furtherance of the purposes set forth in these By-Laws.” Id.\n\n        Pursuant to § 4.1 of the By-Laws,\n\n        Unless otherwise prohibited by law or sections 4.3 and 4.4 of these By-Laws, the\n        Corporation shall indemnify any Trustee or officer of the Corporation, any former\n        Trustee or officer of the Corporation, or any person who may have served at its\n        request as a trustee, director or officer of another corporation or entity, whether for\n        profit or not for profit, and may, by resolution of the Board of Trustees, indemnify\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       any employee or agent of the Corporation against any and all expenses and liabilities\n       actually and necessarily incurred by him or her or imposed on him or her in\n       connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether actual or threatened,\n       civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including appeals) in which he or she\n       is or may be made a party by reason of having been such Trustee, officer, person,\n       employee or agent, subject to the limitation, however, that there shall be no\n       indemnification in relation to matters as to which he or she shall be adjudged in such\n       claim, action, suit or proceeding to be guilty of a criminal offense or liable to the\n       Corporation for damages arising out of his or her own negligence or misconduct in\n       the performance of a duty to the Corporation.\n\nThe By-Laws provide that indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, counsel fees and\n\nother costs. Section 4.3 of the By-Laws provides that if AGM&M is ever deemed a private\n\nfoundation within the meaning of Section 509 of the Internal Revenue Code, no indemnification\n\nshall be paid if such payment would constitute an act of self-dealing or a taxable expenditure as\n\ndefined in Sections 4941(d) or 4945(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively. Id. § 4.3.\n\n       5.      The Unanimous Written Consent Agreement\n\n       On October 30, 2003, each of the four initial trustees of AGM&M signed a document\n\ntitled Unanimous Written Consent in Lieu of the Organization Meeting of the Board of Trustees\n\nof AGM&M. See DX-1 (hereinafter, “UWC”). By unanimous written consent, the Board of\n\nTrustees adopted a series of resolutions. First, the actions of the incorporators were ratified and\n\nthe By-Laws were approved. Second, the initial donors (and their appointed trustees) were\n\nrecognized to be CFF (Cafesjian), Hirair Hovnanian (himself), Anoush Mathevosian (herself),\n\nand the Assembly (Kaloosdian). Cafesjian was appointed Chairman and President, Hovnanian\n\nwas appointed Vice Chairman, and John Waters was appointed Secretary and Treasurer.\n\n       Through the Unanimous Written Consent agreement, the AGM&M Board of Trustees\n\nauthorized the officers to pay all of the organizational expenses of the corporation. The actions\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fof the Chairman (Cafesjian) and the Secretary/Treasurer (Waters) in negotiating the purchase of\n\nthe Adjacent Properties were ratified and approved, and the Secretary/Treasurer was authorized\n\n“to enter into and execute any and all documents necessary to effect the purchase” of the\n\nAdjacent Properties and “to take such other action as deemed necessary or desired to effect such\n\ntransactions.” UWC at 3. The AGM&M Board also approved and ratified the negotiation of\n\ngrant agreements with donors and the Assembly, and the Secretary/Treasurer was authorized to\n\nnegotiate further grant agreements with donors. The Board also accepted from the Assembly its\n\npower to appoint trustees for the Armenian National Institute.\n\n       E.      Efforts to Develop An Armenian Genocide Museum Through AGM&M\n\n       The facts surrounding what happened after AGM&M was formally created were\n\nthoroughly discussed in the Court’s prior Memorandum Opinion and need not be repeated herein.\n\nThe AGM&M Board of Trustees was unable to reach consensus on the proper size and scope of\n\nthe project, and tensions between Cafesjian and Hovnanian increased over a series of\n\ndisagreements about the museum project and other policies of the Assembly. By 2006, relations\n\nbetween the parties had completely broken down, prompting Cafesjian to propose that AGM&M\n\nbe dissolved. Cafesjian ultimately resigned from the AGM&M Board of Trustees, designating\n\nWaters as his successor. After Cafesjian sued the Assembly for payment on the promissory note,\n\nthe other AGM&M Trustees voted to exclude Waters from participation on all matters relating to\n\nthe museum project. This resulted in a series of lawsuits filed by the parties fighting for control\n\nof AGM&M and alleging mismanagement of the corporation. The three other AGM&M trustees\n\nattempted to move forward with the project without Waters’s involvement, but they were unable\n\nto raise the funds necessary to implement a development plan. Accordingly, the museum was not\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fdeveloped by December 31, 2010, thus triggering the reversion clause in the Grant Agreement.\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A.      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding CFF’s Obligation to\n               Reimburse AGM&M for the Value of Properties that Revert Under the Grant\n               Agreement\n\n       The Court ruled in its prior Memorandum Opinion that the reversion clause in the Grant\n\nAgreement was valid and enforceable and that CFF and Cafesjian may exercise their rights under\n\nthat clause effective December 31, 2010. Cafesjian informed the Court that only CFF will\n\nexercise its rights under the reversion clause and that CFF will elect to have the properties\n\ntransferred in lieu of the grant funds. The Court indicated, however, that Plaintiffs had raised\n\nquestions about whether returning the properties to CFF violates the rule—stated in the\n\nAGM&M By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation—that no part of AGM&M’s net earnings shall\n\ninure to the benefit of any trustee. The Court asked the parties to address in further briefing\n\nwhether it would be inequitable to enforce the reversion clause without requiring CFF to\n\nreimburse AGM&M for any potential increased value over the amount of funds originally\n\ndonated by CFF or Cafesjian, and to address whether it was the original intent of the contracting\n\nparties that the reversion would be a nonprofit transaction. Through supplemental briefing, the\n\nparties have clarified their positions on these issues.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the reversion clause in the Grant Agreement, when read in context\n\nwith the other provisions of the Grant Agreement and the terms of the AGM&M By-Laws and\n\nArticles of Incorporation, should be construed as requiring that CFF not realize a profit from the\n\nreversion. Plaintiffs contend that CFF will profit from the reversion because the value of the\n\nproperties being transferred exceeds the value of the donation that CFF and Cafesjian made as\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fpart of the Grant Agreement. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that a reversion without some form of\n\nreimbursement would violate federal tax laws applicable to nonprofit organizations under\n\n§ 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Defendants, by contrast, claim that the language in the\n\nGrant Agreement is unambiguous and places no restrictions on the right of CFF to elect a\n\nreversion of the properties rather than the grant funds. They also dispute Plaintiffs’ claim that the\n\nreversion runs afoul of the tax laws. The Court shall address these arguments below.\n\n                1.      The Grant Agreement\n\n        Ultimately, the issue before the Court is a straightforward question of contract\n\ninterpretation: does the Grant Agreement require CFF to reimburse AGM&M for the extent to\n\nwhich the value of the properties to be transferred exceeds the value of the grant funds donated to\n\nacquire them?\n\n        The District of Columbia adheres to an “objective” law of contracts, meaning that “the\n\nwritten language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the\n\nparties [regardless] of the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract, unless the\n\nwritten language is not susceptible of a clear and definite undertaking, or unless there is fraud,\n\nduress, or mutual mistake.” Dyer v. Bilaal, 983 A.2d 349, 354-55 (D.C. 2009) (citation omitted;\n\nbrackets in original). “If the court finds that the contract has more than one reasonable\n\ninterpretation and therefore is ambiguous, then the court–after admitting probative extrinsic\n\nevidence–must determine what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have\n\nthought the disputed language meant.” Tillery v. D.C. Contract Appeals Bd., 912 A.2d 1169,\n\n1176 (D.C. 2006) (quoting In re Bailey, 883 A.2d 106, 118 (D.C. 2005)). “Ambiguity exists\n\nonly if the court determines that the proper interpretation of the contract cannot be derived from\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fthe contractual language exclusively, and requires consideration of evidence outside the contract\n\nitself.” Steele Foundations, Inc. v. Clark Constr. Grp., Inc., 937 A.2d 148, 153 (D.C. 2007).\n\n“[C]ontracts are not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties do not agree upon their\n\nproper construction.” Id. In determining whether a contract is ambiguous, courts examine the\n\ndocument on its face and give the language its plain meaning. Tillery, 912 A.2d at 1176.\n\n        The first step in interpreting a contract is to determine “what a reasonable person in the\n\nposition of the parties would have thought the disputed language meant.” Steele Foundations,\n\n937 A.2d at 154 (quoting Dodek v. CF 16 Corp., 537 A.2d 1086, 1092 (D.C. 1988)). “The\n\nmeaning must be ascertained in light of all the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time\n\nthe contract was made,” and “[t]he writing must be interpreted as a whole, giving a reasonable,\n\nlawful, and effective meaning to all its terms.” 1010 Potomac Assocs. v. Grocery Mfrs. of Am.,\n\nInc., 485 A.2d 199, 205 (D.C. 1984) (internal citations omitted).\n\n        The language in the Grant Agreement is unambiguous: if the conditions triggering the\n\nreversion are met, “at the Grantor’s sole discretion, the Assembly shall return to the Grantor the\n\nGrant funds or transfer to the Grantor the Grant Property.” It is clear from this language that the\n\nGrantor (CFF and Cafesjian) may choose between a return of the funds donated and a transfer of\n\nthe properties. There is no language in the reversion clause or anywhere else in the Grant\n\nAgreement that restricts the Grantor’s right to receive the Grant Property. The Court presumes\n\nthat if the parties had intended to place any restrictions of the Grantor’s right to elect a transfer of\n\nthe Grant Property, they would have memorialized that intent in the Grant Agreement itself,\n\nparticularly in light of the fact that the Grant Agreement contains an integration clause. See\n\nLuther Williams, Jr., Inc. v. Johnson, 229 A.2d 163, 165 (D.C. 1967) (“[I]t has always been\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fpresumed that a written contract is the final repository of the agreement of the parties. . . . [A]n\n\nintegration clause merely strengthens this presumption.”) (internal citation omitted).\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the two options in the reversion clause, “when read together and with\n\nthe balance of the Grant Agreement, signify that the exercise of the reversion would be a\n\nnonprofit transaction.” See Pls.’ Br. Regarding Reimbursement at 3. However, that is not a\n\nnatural construction of the plain language of the Grant Agreement. All parties knew at the time\n\nthey entered into the agreement that the value of the Grant Property, which included the Bank\n\nBuilding and the Adjacent Properties, would be potentially much greater than the value of the\n\nGrant funds, which covered the purchase of the Adjacent Properties and only about half the cost\n\nof the Bank Building (the other half being covered by Anoush Mathevosian). Therefore, even at\n\nthe outset, the Grantor’s choice was not between two options that were equal in value. It is\n\nimplausible that the parties would have intended the options to be equal seven years later on the\n\nreversion date of December 31, 2010, for this would effectively eliminate the Grantor’s right to\n\nelect the most valuable remedy.\n\n       It is even more inconceivable that the parties would have intended for the transfer of the\n\nGrant Property to be a nonprofit transaction without specifying any provisions for determining\n\nthe value of the Grant Property at the time of transfer. Valuing property in the absence of an\n\narms-length market transaction is inherently uncertain, and the record at trial indicated that there\n\nwere widely varying appraisals of the properties depending on whether they would be used to\n\nbuild a museum or sold to a commercial developer, with no definite valuation. See Trial Tr.\n\n(11/16 PM) at 85-87; DX-513N. Any valuation offered by the parties at this time would be\n\nspeculative. Since the Court has determined that there are no “strings” attached to CFF’s use of\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fthe properties once transferred, how would the Court decide what method of valuation was\n\nappropriate to ensure that CFF did not realize a profit? Such uncertainty over how to implement\n\na “nonprofit” transfer is a significant reason to assume that this was not what the parties\n\nintended.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that their interpretation of the options as equal in value is supported by\n\nthe limiting phrase in the reversion clause: “to the degree any portion of the Grants has been\n\nfunded . . . .” They argue that this phrase must be read as limiting the Grantor’s right of\n\nreversion to the extent that the Grants have actually been funded, and they argue that Defendants’\n\nconstruction “would allow the grantors to take back the entire grant properties even if they had\n\nnot fulfilled their payment obligations under the pledge.” Pl.’s Br. Regarding Reimbursement at\n\n7. But Plaintiffs overlook the fact that under the Grant Agreement, the Grant funds had to be\n\nused to purchase the Grant Property, meaning that if Cafesjian and CFF had not fulfilled their\n\npledges, AGM&M would never have acquired all of the properties that now must be transferred.\n\nTherefore, there was never any risk that Cafesjian and CFF would receive a windfall, for\n\nexample, by paying for the acquisition of only one of the Adjacent Properties and then receiving\n\nall four of them under the reversion clause. Ultimately, the Court is not persuaded that the phrase\n\n“to the degree any portion of the Grants has been funded” places any restriction on the Grantor’s\n\nright to elect a transfer of the Grant Property, particularly where the record demonstrates that\n\nCafesjian and CFF have fulfilled their obligations under the Grant Agreement.6\n\n\n       6\n        The record at trial indicated that the Assembly, acting on behalf of AGM&M, refused to\ncash CFF’s check for its annual payment of $150,000 for the 1340 G Street property in 2007.\nThe Court found that although the payment was made a few days late, there was no reason that\nthe Assembly could not have cashed the check and credited CFF with the payment. Accordingly,\nthe Court finds that CFF and Cafesjian satisfied their obligation to make the annual payment in\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Plaintiffs also argue that the requirement in § 3.3 of the Grant Agreement that the Grant\n\nfunds be used “only for purposes described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code”\n\nsupports their position. By its own terms, this provision acts as a limitation only on the use of\n\nthe Grant funds; it says nothing about transferring the Grant Property. Even assuming that § 3.3\n\napplied to the transfer of the Grant Property, the general language in § 3.3 cannot be fairly read to\n\nimplicitly restrict the more specific language contained in the reversion clause. Therefore, the\n\nCourt finds that § 3.3 does not impose any reimbursement requirement on the transfer of the\n\nGrant Property.\n\n       Plaintiffs complain that without a reimbursement requirement, CFF will be allowed to\n\nretain the benefit of the appreciated value of the properties, Anoush Mathevosian’s $3.5 million\n\ndonation, and more than seven years of carrying costs, taxes, and insurance that were paid for the\n\nproperties, with the result being that AGM&M is stripped of nearly all its assets. Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the parties could not have intended such an inequitable result. But this was a foreseeable\n\nconsequence at the time the parties entered into the agreement. The reversion clause in the Grant\n\nAgreement was intended to create a meaningful incentive for the parties to substantially complete\n\nthe museum project by December 31, 2010. Since the parties failed to reach that milestone,\n\nPlaintiffs must live with the consequences of their bargained-for agreement. The Court cannot\n\nreform the plain terms of the Grant Agreement simply because Plaintiffs belatedly realized how\n\ndire those consequences would be.\n\n\n\n\n2007, and there was no other evidence at trial suggesting that CFF and Cafesjian did not perform\ntheir funding obligations under the Grant Agreement.\n\n                                                 26\n\f               2.      The AGM&M By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the Court should look beyond the four corners of the Grant\n\nAgreement to the AGM&M By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation in determining the meaning\n\nof the reversion clause. However, the Court has no occasion to search beyond the text of the\n\nGrant Agreement because the terms of the reversion clause are clear and unambiguous. See 1010\n\nPotomac Assocs., 485 A.2d at 205 (“Extrinsic evidence of the parties’ subjective intent may be\n\nresorted to only if the document is ambiguous.”). Although the Court may consider these\n\ndocuments as part of the circumstances surrounding the formation of the Grant Agreement, see\n\nid., the execution of these documents does not alter the Court’s interpretation of the Grant\n\nAgreement. Plaintiffs contend that the adoption of the AGM&M Articles of Incorporation and\n\nBy-Laws around the same time as the Grant Agreement and Transfer Agreement demonstrates\n\nthat the parties intended for the private inurement restrictions contained in the By-Laws and the\n\nArticles to apply to the Grant Agreement. Again, however, the specific and direct language in\n\nthe reversion clause is the best evidence of the parties’ intent. The Court is not persuaded that\n\nthe parties would have intended to restrict the Grantor’s reversion rights through more general\n\nlanguage contained in entirely separate documents. See Washington Automotive Co. v. 1828 L\n\nStreet Assocs., 906 A.2d 869, 880 (D.C. 2006) (“[It is] a familiar principle of contract\n\ninterpretation[] that ‘specific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general\n\nlanguage.’”) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 203(c) (1981)). The lack of any\n\nexplicit restriction on the transfer in the Grant Agreement strongly suggests that the parties did\n\nnot intend to subject the transfer to any private inurement regulations.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not construe the reversion clause in a manner that\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fcould result in adverse tax consequences for AGM&M, suggesting that the parties would not\n\nhave intended such a result. However, there is no reason to assume that the parties expected\n\nAGM&M to survive if the reversion clause was exercised; to the contrary, it is reasonable to\n\nassume that the parties expected the reversion of either the Grant funds or the Grant Property to\n\nbe the death knell for the organization. The parties in this litigation created AGM&M for the\n\nexpress purpose of creating a museum and memorial devoted to the Armenian Genocide on the\n\nsite of the Bank Building and the Adjacent Properties. Without those properties, it is unclear\n\nhow AGM&M could be expected to fulfill its mission and survive as an organization. Therefore,\n\nthe Court is not persuaded that the parties intended to spare AGM&M from any adverse tax\n\nconsequences that might result from the transfer of the Grant Property.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that construing the reversion clause as requiring no reimbursement for\n\nappreciated value would create “a vehicle for tax fraud” because it would allow wealthy donors\n\nto put cash into a charity for the acquisition of real estate, wait for the value of that real estate to\n\nincrease over time, and then seek the return of the appreciated real estate pursuant to some unmet\n\ncondition, thereby gaining the appreciated property without any consequence. See Pls.’ Br.\n\nRegarding Reimbursement at 7. It is unclear why Plaintiffs believe there would be no tax\n\nconsequences to the donor in this hypothetical, and Plaintiffs cite no authority to explain their\n\ntheory of this “vehicle for tax fraud.” In any event, the collection and recovery of federal taxes is\n\nthe sole responsibility of the United States government; Plaintiffs cannot compel Defendants to\n\ncomply with the tax code through this litigation. See 26 U.S.C. § 7401 (“No civil action for the\n\ncollection or recovery of taxes, or of any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, shall be commenced unless\n\nthe Secretary [of the Treasury] authorizes or sanctions the proceedings and the Attorney General\n\n\n                                                   28\n\for his delegate directs that the action be commenced.”). Furthermore, the Court has no power to\n\nchange the terms of the Grant Agreement merely because enforcing the reversion clause can be\n\nexpected to have adverse tax consequences for the parties.\n\n               3.      Tax Regulations Prohibiting Private Benefit\n\n       Plaintiffs have presented the Court with a rather complicated set of arguments as to why\n\nthey believe that allowing CFF to profit from the transfer of the Grant Property will violate\n\nfederal tax laws pertaining to tax-exempt organizations. As the Court has explained, these\n\narguments are essentially irrelevant because the Grant Agreement clearly and unambiguously\n\nrequires AGM&M to transfer the properties without regard to the tax consequences of the\n\ntransfer. In any event, the Court is not persuaded that the transfer of the properties to CFF\n\nviolates the tax laws as Plaintiffs claim.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ central argument is that by transferring the Grant Property to CFF, AGM&M\n\nwill be violating regulations that require § 501(c)(3) organizations to be operated exclusively for\n\ntax-exempt purposes. Pursuant to 26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(2), “[a]n organization is not\n\noperated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes if its net earnings inure in whole or in part\n\nto the benefit of private shareholders or individuals.” A private shareholder or individual is\n\ndefined as a person having a personal and private interest in the activities of the organization. 26\n\nC.F.R. § 1.501(a)-1(c). The purpose of the inurement provision is “to prevent the siphoning of\n\ncharitable receipts to insiders of the charity.” United Cancer Council, Inc. v. Comm’r, 165 F.3d\n\n1173, 1176 (7th Cir. 1999); see also I.R.S. Priv. Ltr. Rul. 201047033 (Nov. 3, 2010) (“Inurement\n\nis any transfer of charitable assets to the organization’s insiders for which the organization does\n\nnot receive adequate consideration. Inurement can take many forms.”).\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f       Defendants argue that there can be no violation of the inurement provision because the\n\nproperty is being transferred to CFF, another 501(c)(3) organization which is neither a\n\nshareholder of AGM&M nor a private individual. Because CFF itself must operate exclusively\n\nfor tax-exempt purposes, Defendants argue that there will be no “private” benefit from the\n\ntransfer of property that would frustrate the purposes of § 501(c)(3). Plaintiffs do not directly\n\nrespond to this argument in their briefing, and they have cited no cases in which it was\n\ndetermined that a 501(c)(3) organization was a private shareholder or individual for purposes of\n\nthe inurement provision. In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel essentially conceded the point during a\n\nStatus Hearing on February 24, 2011, noting that “by designating the actual acquiring entity as\n\nCFF, that . . . avoids some of the limitations in the private inurement law.” 2/24/11 Hr’g Tr. at\n\n16. Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that the transfer of the properties to CFF will\n\nviolate the prohibition on private inurement as stated in the federal tax laws and incorporated into\n\nthe By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation of AGM&M.7\n\n       Moreover, based on a review of the substance of the transaction as a whole, the Court is\n\nnot persuaded that the transfer of the property under the Grant Agreement qualifies as private\n\ninurement. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ characterization, this is not a case where a wealthy donor gave\n\nmoney to an organization to buy property and then the corporation gave the property back to the\n\ndonor after it had substantially appreciated. This is a case where a donor made a conditional gift\n\nof funds to be used for a specific purpose, and after AGM&M was unable to fulfill the required\n\n\n\n       7\n         Plaintiffs suggested during the February 24, 2011 Status Hearing that because the Grant\nAgreement defines the “Grantor” as Cafesjian and CFF, there must be a private benefit to\nCafesjian. However, Cafesjian has relinquished his right to receive the property in favor of CFF,\nand Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how Cafesjian will benefit from the transfer.\n\n                                                 30\n\fconditions, it was compelled to allow the donor to recover the properties acquired with the gifted\n\nfunds. Defendants rely heavily on Underwood v. United States, 461 F. Supp. 1382 (N.D. Tex.\n\n1978), which also involved the return of a conditional gift. In Underwood, the plaintiff had\n\nagreed to donate $1 million to the Southern Methodist University School of Law through a\n\ncharitable foundation with the understanding that all of his donations would be deductible for\n\nfederal income tax purposes. See id. at 1384. After the IRS disallowed some of Underwood’s\n\ndeductions to the charitable foundation, Underwood reached an agreement with the foundation to\n\nreturn his donations so that he could give the money directly to the law school. Id. at 1385. The\n\nIRS determined that the return of funds from the foundation amounted to self-dealing in violation\n\nof 26 U.S.C. § 4941, which imposes a tax on any act of self-dealing between a private foundation\n\nand any “disqualified person” such as a substantial contributor to the foundation. See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4941, 4946(a)(1).8 However, the Underwood court held that the return of funds by the\n\nfoundation was not an act of self-dealing because it was simply the return of a conditional gift.\n\n461 F. Supp. at 1389.\n\n       Underwood is distinguishable from this case, primarily because the donor in that case\n\nreceived an exact refund of the amount he had donated. By contrast, CFF is going to receive\n\nproperties that were purchased for $3.5 million more than CFF and Cafesjian donated to acquire\n\nthem (the amount of Mathevosian’s contribution) and that may or may not have appreciated in\n\nvalue since then. Therefore, it could be argued that CFF will “profit” from the transfer of the\n\n\n       8\n          Plaintiffs argue that AGM&M is now a private foundation and therefore may be subject\nto this tax if it transfers the Grant Property to CFF. As explained below, the Court does not\nbelieve that the transfer can be characterized as an act of self-dealing within the meaning of\n§ 4941. Furthermore, Plaintiffs assume without discussion that CFF falls within the definition of\n“disqualified person” under the statute, but this is not clear.\n\n                                                31\n\fproperties. However, pecuniary gain does not automatically equate to inurement; the question is\n\nwhether the profit is reasonable in light of the benefits to AGM&M. Cf. Church By Mail, Inc. v.\n\nComm’r, 765 F.2d 1387, 1392-93 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that payment of excessive salaries to\n\nemployees may constitute inurement to the benefit of a private person). The circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Grant Agreement and the formation of AGM&M demonstrate that the reversion\n\nclause was an essential part of the bargain that enabled AGM&M to obtain the funds necessary to\n\nacquire the properties. Cafesjian and CFF were unwilling to donate additional millions of dollars\n\nto the genocide museum and memorial project unless they could be reasonably assured that the\n\nproject would be substantially completed in a timely manner. Therefore, they demanded a\n\nreversion clause that would enable them to get control of the properties in case AGM&M was\n\nunsuccessful. This was not a sham transaction for AGM&M to shelter assets for Cafesjian and\n\nCFF; it was an agreement that gave AGM&M a financial incentive to be successful with the\n\nmoney donated by Cafesjian and CFF. The Court has already found that Cafesjian and the CFF-\n\ndesignated trustees of AGM&M acted in good faith to try to develop the genocide museum and\n\nmemorial before the reversion date of December 31, 2010. In that regard, it is unfair and without\n\nsupport to characterize the Grant Agreement as an act of self-dealing or to state that AGM&M\n\nwas operating for the private benefit of Cafesjian or CFF.9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         Plaintiffs erroneously claim that Cafesjian was entitled to four votes on the AGM&M\nBoard of Trustees by virtue of his pledge of more than $15 million. See Pls.’ Reimbursement Br.\nat 14. At most, Cafesjian would have been entitled to three votes under the AGM&M By-Laws.\nHowever, because of the 80% vote requirement, Cafesjian would have had veto power over the\nBoard’s decisions even if he were only recognized as having one vote. In any event, the Court\nhas already rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that Cafesjian acted in bad faith through his\nmanagement of AGM&M.\n\n                                                32\n\f               4.      Implementing the Transfer\n\n       For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that the Grant Agreement clearly\n\nand unambiguously requires AGM&M to transfer the Grant Property to CFF without regard to\n\nany tax consequences that flow therefrom. To date, AGM&M has failed to transfer the Grant\n\nProperty, citing concerns about the tax consequences of the transfer and demanding that several\n\nrestrictions be placed on the transfer.10 Now that the Court has addressed Plaintiffs’ arguments\n\nrelating to the tax consequences of the transfer, there should be no reason for further delaying the\n\ntransfer of the properties. Defendants have asked the Court to order the trustees of AGM&M to\n\nsign certain documents prepared by Defendants to complete the transfer. The Court declines at\n\nthis time to order the trustees to sign the specific documents drafted by Defendants’ counsel.\n\nInstead, the Court shall order the AGM&M trustees to transfer the property to CFF in accordance\n\nwith D.C. law by no later than May 23, 2011.\n\n       B.      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding AGM&M’s Indemnification\n               of Cafesjian and Waters\n\n       The Court ruled in its prior Memorandum Opinion that Defendants Cafesjian and Waters\n\nwere entitled to indemnification under § 4.1 of the AGM&M By-Laws for expenses actually and\n\nnecessarily incurred by them in defense of claims brought against them by Plaintiffs. The\n\nindemnification requirement extends only to claims that arose out of Cafesjian’s or Waters’s\n\nduties as officers or directors of AGM&M, which are asserted in Count One of the Consolidated\n\nComplaint. Expenses relating to the Assembly’s claims against Cafesjian and Waters for breach\n\n\n       10\n          Among the conditions that the AGM&M trustees seek to impose is an agreement that\nCFF will forfeit the Grant Property to the Assembly if a permanent museum and memorial\ndevoted to the Armenian Genocide is not constructed within five years. See [212] Pls.’ Status\nReport at 4.\n\n                                                33\n\fof fiduciary duty or misappropriation of trade secrets are not covered by the indemnification\n\nclause in the AGM&M By-Laws. The Court previously indicated that it would determine the\n\namount of indemnification in post-trial proceedings. Cafesjian and Waters have submitted a\n\nbrief with supporting documentation that sets forth the amount of their expenses. Plaintiffs have\n\nfiled an opposition contesting the reasonableness and validity of those expenses, and Defendants\n\nhave filed a reply. Plaintiffs raise a series of objections to Defendants’ request for\n\nindemnification, and the Court shall address each below.\n\n       “[O]nce a contractual entitlement to attorney’s fees has been ascertained, the\n\ndetermination of a reasonable fee award is for the trial court in light of the relevant\n\ncircumstances.” Ideal Electronic Sec. Co. v. Int’l Fid. Ins. Co., 129 F.3d 143, 150 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1997). “[T]he reasonableness of an attorney’s fees award is within the sound discretion of the\n\ntrial court and is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.” Id. The Court has discretion to\n\ndetermine the nature and amount of proof necessary to determine reasonableness and may fix the\n\namount of the fee without hearing any evidence at all. FDIC v. Bender, 127 F.3d 58, 64 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n               1.      Self-Dealing\n\n       Although they did not raise this argument before the Court issued its Memorandum\n\nOpinion, Plaintiffs now contend that indemnification is not required under the By-Laws because\n\nAGM&M has been deemed a private foundation within the meaning of § 509 of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code and the payment of legal expenses to Cafesjian and Waters would amount to an\n\nact of self-dealing under § 4941(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. See By-Laws § 4.3 (“[I]f at\n\nany time the Corporation is deemed to be a private foundation within the meaning of Section 509\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fof the Code then, during such time, no payment shall be made under this Article if such payment\n\nwould constitute an act of self-dealing or a taxable expenditure, as defined in Section 4941(d) or\n\nSection 4945(d), respectively, of the Code.”). Defendants dispute whether AGM&M has been\n\n“deemed to be a private foundation,” since there is no evidence that the IRS has yet made such a\n\ndetermination. Plaintiffs have submitted financial documents to the Court under seal purportedly\n\nshowing that AGM&M lost its status as a public charity in fiscal year 2010, when its public\n\nsupport fraction dropped below the level required to maintain public charity status. See [217]\n\nPls.’ Status Report to the Court at 3-5. However, there is no evidence before the Court indicating\n\nthat the IRS has made any determination that AGM&M qualifies as a private foundation.\n\nSection 4.3 provides that indemnification shall not be paid “during such time” that “the\n\nCorporation is deemed to be private foundation,” suggesting that until a determination is made by\n\nthe IRS, indemnification must be paid.\n\n       Even assuming that AGM&M is deemed a private foundation, however, Treasury\n\nregulations provide that indemnification of former officers does not amount to an act of self-\n\ndealing for purposes of § 4941(d). Pursuant to 26 C.F.R. § 53.4941(d)-2(f)(3),\n\n       section 4941(d)(1) shall not apply to the indemnification by a private foundation of\n       a foundation manager, with respect to the manager’s defense in any civil judicial or\n       civil administrative proceeding arising out of the manager’s performance of services\n       (or failure to perform services) on behalf of the foundation, against all expenses\n       (other than taxes, including taxes imposed by chapter 42, penalties, or expenses of\n       correction) including attorneys’ fees, judgments and settlement expenditures if—\n               (A) Such expenses are reasonably incurred by the manager in connection with\n               such proceeding; and\n               (B) The manager has not acted willfully and without reasonable cause with\n               respect to the act or failure to act which led to such proceeding or to liability\n               for tax under chapter 42.\n\nTherefore, the By-Laws provision precluding payment of indemnification where it constitutes\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fself-dealing does not preclude the Court from ordering AGM&M to pay Cafesjian and Waters for\n\nthe reasonable expenses they incurred in defending their claims.\n\n               2.      Arbitration\n\n       Plaintiffs next argue that the Court should reject Defendants’ request for indemnification\n\nbecause the legal expenses associated with this litigation could have been avoided had Cafesjian\n\nand Waters agreed to arbitrate this dispute. Plaintiffs had filed a demand for arbitration with the\n\nAmerican Arbitration Association on September 13, 2007 relating to the first lawsuit filed by\n\nCafesjian and CFF against the Assembly in Minnesota. On October 10, 2007, Cafesjian and\n\nWaters, inter alia, filed a lawsuit in Minnesota to enjoin the arbitration. The parties ultimately\n\nstipulated to the dismissal of that lawsuit in September 2007. Therefore, Plaintiffs have long\n\nsince abandoned any attempt to compel arbitration of the issues contested in these actions, and\n\nthere is nothing in the arbitration provisions of the AGM&M By-Laws that requires Cafesjian\n\nand Waters to agree to arbitration. Most significantly, the indemnification provision in the\n\nAGM&M By-Laws does not require Cafesjian or Waters to submit to arbitration. Accordingly,\n\nthere is no basis for concluding that Cafesjian’s and Waters’s legal expenses are unreasonable or\n\nunnecessary based on their decision to litigate in federal court. The Court also notes that\n\nPlaintiffs did not include this argument in their proposed conclusions of law or otherwise present\n\nthis argument to the Court during the trial; this is an independent reason for rejecting Plaintiffs’\n\nargument.\n\n               3.      Expenses Incurred by CFF\n\n       Plaintiffs next claim that CFF has paid the legal expenses for this litigation on behalf of\n\nCafesjian and Waters, and since CFF is not subject to indemnification under the AGM&M By-\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fLaws, they claim that no indemnification is owed. In response to Plaintiffs’ claim, Defendants\n\nstate that they have removed any expenses paid by CFF from their request for indemnification,\n\nleaving only expenses paid by Cafesjian.11 Defendants have produced a declaration with\n\nsupporting documentation demonstrating that Cafesjian personally paid for the legal expenses\n\nthat were not covered by CFF. See Defs.’ Reply in Support of Br. Quantifying Attorneys’ Fees\n\nfor Indemnification, Ex. E (Suppl. Decl. of William G. Laxton, Jr.). Accordingly, the Court shall\n\nconsider only these expenses that were incurred by Cafesjian in determining the amount of\n\nindemnification required under the AGM&M By-Laws.\n\n               4.      Identification of Expenses Subject to Indemnification\n\n       Because the scope of indemnification under the AGM&M By-Laws is limited to the\n\nexpenses incurred by Cafesjian and Waters in defending the claims asserted against them as\n\nformer officers and trustees of AGM&M, Defendants must identify which expenses are related to\n\nthese claims and separate any expenses that they incurred asserting counterclaims against\n\nPlaintiffs or defending against separate claims asserted by the Assembly. In order to accomplish\n\nthis task, Defendants have identified three categories of expenses: (1) those that are clearly\n\nrelated to the defense of claims asserted against Waters and Cafesjian in their capacities as\n\nfiduciaries of AGM&M; (2) those that are clearly related to other claims asserted in the litigation;\n\nand (3) those expenses that cannot easily be separated between these two categories of claims\n\n(“blended expenses”). Defendants seek indemnity for the amount of expenses in the first\n\ncategory and 67% of the blended expenses, based on Defendants’ estimate of the proportion of\n\n\n\n       11\n        Waters testified at trial that he had not paid for any legal expenses. See Trial Tr. (11/15\nAM) at 36-37.\n\n                                                 37\n\fthose expenses that can be fairly attributed to the defense of claims that are subject to\n\nindemnification. Plaintiffs do not take issue with Defendants’ decisions about which expenses\n\nbelong in each category. However, Plaintiffs argue that none of the blended expenses should be\n\nawarded because they cannot clearly be linked to the claims that must be indemnified.\n\nAlternatively, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ proposed percentage is too high and should be\n\ngreatly reduced to 19%.\n\n       The parties have cited only a few cases to support their arguments regarding the proper\n\nallocation of attorneys’ fees, all of which involve application of a fee-shifting statute rather than a\n\ncontractual indemnification clause. In Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), the Supreme\n\nCourt addressed how fees should be awarded to a prevailing party where the party prevailed on\n\nonly some of the claims asserted in the litigation. The Court noted that in such cases, “[m]uch of\n\ncounsel’s time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide\n\nthe hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis,” and therefore courts “should focus on the\n\nsignificance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably\n\nexpended on the litigation.” 461 U.S. at 435; accord Thomas v. Nat’l Football League Players\n\nAss’n, 273 F.3d 1124, 1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The most analogous case cited by the parties is\n\nAlpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralson Purina Co., No. Civ. A. 86-2728, 1991 WL 1292963 (D.D.C. Dec.\n\n4, 1991), in which the court awarded attorneys’ fees that were limited to the costs of prosecuting\n\nsuccessful aspects of the prevailing party’s case-in-chief. See id. at *12-13. In that case, the\n\nparty seeking an award undertook a three-step methodology to calculate the time attributable to\n\nits successful counterclaim: first, it excluded time clearly unrelated to the successful claim; then,\n\nit segregated the remaining legal fees into various subject matter categories based on the nature\n\n\n                                                  38\n\fof the relationship to the successful claim; and finally it estimated the percentage of time in each\n\ncategory that could fairly be attributed to a successful result. Id. at *12. The court accepted this\n\nmethodology as a valid means of proving the amount of fees that should be awarded. Id.\n\n       These cases are somewhat in tension with the D.C. Court of Appeals’s decision in\n\nSafeway Stores, Inc. v. Chamberlain Protective Services, Inc., 451 A.2d 66 (D.C. 1982). In that\n\ncase, the court affirmed the denial of attorneys’ fees and expenses to a party where the court\n\ndetermined that it was impossible to allocate the fees and expenses among three claims, only one\n\nof which was subject to indemnity. Id. at 72-73. However, in that case, the party’s right to\n\nindemnification was based on the limited exception to the American Rule that allows a party\n\nwrongfully involved in litigation with a third party to recover the expenses of such litigation from\n\nthe wrongdoer. See id. at 68-69. It is therefore unclear whether Safeway Stores controls beyond\n\nits core holding that “an indemnitee may be denied recovery of attorney’s fees from his\n\ncodefendant indemnitor where the fees incurred in establishing his right to indemnity are\n\nconsidered inseparable from those incurred in defending the alleged negligence.” Id. at 73.\n\n       The Court finds that it is unnecessary to resolve this issue at this time because Defendants\n\nmay be able to break down many of their “blended” expenses in a manner that more clearly\n\nidentifies whether the costs incurred or the work performed were actually related to the claims\n\nsubject to indemnification. Moreover, beyond criticizing Defendants’ approach to calculating a\n\npercentage for the blended expenses, Plaintiffs also contend that many of the expenses claimed\n\nby Defendants are unreasonable. Plaintiffs complain that Defendants’ legal bills are bloated by\n\nexcessive time devoted to ordinary tasks, appearances by multiple attorneys where only one was\n\nnecessary, and other unnecessary expenses. In order to expedite resolution of these disputes over\n\n\n                                                 39\n\fthe necessity of particular expenses, the Court shall refer this issue to a magistrate judge for a\n\nreport and recommendation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b) and Local Civil\n\nRule 72.3(a). The magistrate judge may review Defendants’ categorization of “blended”\n\nexpenses and determine whether there is a more appropriate methodology for separating which\n\nexpenses should be indemnified and which should not. The magistrate judge may also review\n\nPlaintiffs’ objections to particular expenses and make decisions about which expenses were\n\n“actually and necessarily incurred” within the meaning of the indemnification provision of the\n\nAGM&M By-Laws. Upon review of the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, the\n\nCourt shall determine, if necessary, whether Defendants’ proposed blended expenses approach is\n\nappropriate and what percentage should be applied to those expenses.\n\n       C.       Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation\n\n       Apart from their claim for indemnification, Defendants have filed a [221] Motion\n\nRequesting Attorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation. Defendants argue that the Court should\n\naward attorneys’ fees under its inherent authority to sanction parties for vexatious conduct or,\n\nalternatively, under 28 U.S.C. § 1927, which provides that “[a]ny attorney or other person . . .\n\nwho so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required to\n\nsatisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred because of\n\nsuch conduct.” Defendants contend that they should be awarded attorneys’ fees based on: (1)\n\nPlaintiffs’ pursuit of a claim for equitable disgorgement of Cafesjian’s investments in Armenia\n\nthat was ultimately withdrawn before trial; (2) Plaintiffs’ refusal to disclose its theories of\n\ndamages during discovery; (3) Plaintiffs’ use of allegedly obstructive tactics during discovery;\n\n(4) Plaintiffs’ filing unnecessary motions in the course of the litigation; and (5) Plaintiffs’ failure\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fto produce a substantial number of documents until the eve of trial. Plaintiffs have filed an\n\nopposition to Defendants’ motion, and Plaintiffs’ trial counsel, K&L Gates LLP, have intervened\n\nfor the purpose of filing an opposition to Defendants’ motion. Defendants have responded to\n\nboth of these oppositions, and the motion is now ripe for adjudication.\n\n       Although the American Rule generally provides that each party must bears its own legal\n\ncosts, the federal courts have inherent power to assess attorneys’ fees when a party has “acted in\n\nbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501\n\nU.S. 32, 45-46 (1991) (quoting Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc’y, 421 U.S. 240,\n\n258-59 (1975)). “As old as the judiciary itself, the inherent power enables courts to protect their\n\ninstitutional integrity and to guard against abuses of the judicial process with contempt citations,\n\nfines, awards of attorneys’ fees, and such other orders and sanctions as they find necessary.”\n\nShepherd v. Am. Broad. Cos., 62 F.3d 1469, 1472 (D.C. Cir. 1995). To support a sanction under\n\nthis inherent authority, “the court must make a finding by clear and convincing evidence that [the\n\n[sanctioned party] committed sanctionable misconduct that is tantamount to bad faith.” Ali v.\n\nTolbert, ___ F.3d ____, 2011 WL 691364, at *5 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 1, 2011).\n\n       The Court may also award attorneys’ fees based on vexatious conduct pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1927. The purpose of § 1927 is to allow the Court “to assess attorney’s fees against an\n\nattorney who frustrates the progress of judicial proceedings.” United States v. Wallace, 964 F.2d\n\n1214, 1218 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Before imposing sanctions on an attorney, the Court must evaluate\n\nwhether the attorney’s conduct was “at least reckless[.]” Id. at 1217. Recklessness is a “high\n\nthreshold . . . and in general requires deliberate action in the face of a known risk, the likelihood\n\nor impact of which the actor inexcusably ignores.” Id. at 1219-20. “The power to assess costs on\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fthe attorney involved is a power which the courts should exercise only in instances of serious and\n\nstudied disregard for the orderly process of justice.” Id. at 1220 (quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted). “[U]nintended, inadvertent, and negligent acts will not support an imposition of\n\nsanctions under section 1927.” Id. at 1219 (quoting Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 631 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)).\n\n          The Court notes at the outset that the majority of Defendants’ requests for fees relate to\n\ndisputes that arose in the course of discovery over what evidence should be produced in relation\n\nto particular claims asserted by Plaintiffs. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide a\n\nmechanism for awarding expenses to parties who incur expenses as a result of unnecessary\n\ndiscovery, and that is the preferred approach for awarding expenses as a result of misconduct\n\nduring discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(3) & 37(a)(5). Defendants did not seek expenses\n\nduring the course of discovery, and Defendants do not rely on the Federal Rules in asking the\n\nCourt to award fees for vexatious litigation.\n\n                 1.      Plaintiffs’ Pursuit of a Claim for Disgorgement of Cafesjian’s Investments\n\n          Defendants argue that they should be awarded the fees they incurred in defending a claim\n\nasserted by the Assembly for disgorgement of Cafesjian’s business interests based on his failure\n\nto disclose those interests to the Assembly under its conflicts of interest policy. The Assembly\n\ndid not explicitly assert such a claim in its original complaint in Civil Action No. 08-255.\n\nHowever, the Assembly did pursue discovery based on a disgorgement theory of damages in\n\nconnection with its claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the conflicts of interest\n\npolicy. Defendants refused to respond to the Assembly’s requests for discovery on relevancy\n\ngrounds, and the Court denied the Assembly’s motion to compel this discovery. The Assembly\n\n\n                                                   42\n\fultimately dropped this claim prior to trial. Defendants complain that they were forced to\n\ninvestigate the Assembly’s disgorgement theory and devote resources to defeating it during the\n\ncourse of the litigation. Defendants essentially argue that the disgorgement claim was frivolous\n\nand that Plaintiffs were asserting it for the improper purpose of harassing Cafesjian with\n\nimproper discovery requests.\n\n       Although the legal basis for the Assembly’s disgorgement claim has never been clear to\n\nthe Court and the claim was ultimately dropped as lacking merit, the Court is not persuaded that\n\nPlaintiffs’ pursuit of that theory demonstrates recklessness or bad faith. It is often the case that\n\nthe contours of a party’s claims evolve throughout the discovery process, particularly with\n\nrespect to damages and remedies. The fact that Plaintiffs propounded overbroad discovery\n\nrequests related to this claim does not warrant imposition of sanctions for vexatious litigation,\n\neven though it may have been sufficient to justify an award of expenses under Rule 26(c) if\n\nDefendants had moved for a protective order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(3) & 37(a)(5) (providing\n\nthat expenses may be awarded if a motion for protective order is granted). The fact that\n\nDefendants did not move for discovery sanctions suggests that Plaintiffs’ efforts to pursue their\n\ndisgorgement claim were not more vexatious than their pursuit of other claims that were\n\nultimately found to be meritless. In fact, the record shows that Plaintiffs’ attempts to litigate a\n\ndisgorgement claim were limited to identifying disgorgement as a potential remedy in their\n\nanswers to interrogatories, requesting discovery relating to Cafesjian’s business interests (which\n\nthe Court denied), and asserting this argument during the deposition of Edele Hovnanian. While\n\nDefendants complain that they were forced to conduct legal research to determine the viability of\n\nPlaintiffs’ theory, that is part of the ordinary costs of civil litigation. Accordingly, the Court\n\n\n                                                  43\n\fdeclines to exercise its discretion to award legal expenses to Defendants based on Plaintiffs’\n\nattempts to pursue a disgorgement claim.\n\n               2.      Plaintiffs’ Failure to Disclose Theories of Damages During Discovery\n\n       Defendants contend that they should be awarded expenses as a result of Plaintiffs’ failure\n\nto disclose various theories of damages during discovery. The Court previously granted\n\nDefendants’ motion to strike any theories of damages that were not sufficiently disclosed during\n\ndiscovery. See Pretrial Conference Mem. Op. & Order (Oct. 22, 2010) at 13-27. However,\n\nDefendants ask for the additional sanction of attorneys’ fees, arguing that Plaintiffs vexatiously\n\navoided their obligations to disclose their theories of damages. Defendants rely on the fact that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to provide a computation of their damages at the outset of discovery as required\n\nby Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii), instructed Dr. Rouben Adalian not to answer questions relating to\n\ndamages during his deposition, and provided incomplete or vague responses to Defendants’\n\ninterrogatories about damages. Defendants also rely on the fact that Plaintiffs’ Rule 30(b)(6)\n\nwitness, Van Krikorian, was unable to answer questions relating to the calculation of damages\n\nduring his deposition. Krikorian testified during that deposition that Plaintiffs would produce an\n\nexpert witness to address the subject of damages, but Plaintiffs never designated any expert\n\nwitnesses.\n\n       It is clear from the record that Plaintiffs were less than forthcoming about their theories of\n\ndamages during discovery, and that is the basis upon which the Court granted Defendants’\n\nmotion to strike those claims. However, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs’ conduct\n\namounts to recklessness or bad faith sufficient to justify a sanction under § 1927 or the Court’s\n\ninherent authority. The record indicates that Plaintiffs did supplement their disclosures with\n\n\n                                                44\n\festimates of their damages, and it appears that they may have had a good faith basis for asserting\n\nthose claims at the time. Ultimately, Plaintiffs were unable to come up with evidence in support\n\nof those claims, and therefore they were unable to give satisfactory responses to Defendants’\n\ndiscovery demands. The Court is not convinced that Plaintiffs were acting vexatiously by\n\nasserting their damages claims during discovery and then being caught without evidence to\n\nsupport them. Therefore, the Court finds that its pretrial sanction precluding Plaintiffs from\n\nproceeding based on undisclosed damages was sufficient, and it declines to award attorneys’ fees\n\nbased on this conduct.\n\n               3.        Plaintiffs’ Alleged Gamesmanship During Discovery\n\n       Defendants next argue that they should be awarded fees as a result of what they call\n\n“unnecessary discovery and obstructive tactics” by Plaintiffs relating to two depositions taken\n\nduring discovery. First, Defendants complain about the fact that Plaintiffs’ counsel instructed\n\nAdalian not to answer questions about damages during his deposition, since this was not a proper\n\ninstruction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2) (“A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only\n\nwhen necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present\n\na motion under Rule 30(d)(3).”) Second, Defendants complain about the fact that two days prior\n\nto Anoush Mathevosian’s scheduled deposition, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a\n\nprotective order to proceed with the deposition by written questions in lieu of an oral\n\nexamination pursuant to Rule 31. Although Plaintiffs based their motion on Mathevosian’s poor\n\nhealth, Defendants argue that it was made for purely strategic reasons because Plaintiffs needed\n\nadditional time to prepare Mathevosian to testify regarding the May 7, 2007 meeting of the\n\nAGM&M Board of Trustees.\n\n\n                                                45\n\f       With respect to deposition of Adalian, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel\n\nhis testimony on the subject of damages. See [59] Order (May 7, 2009). Plaintiffs’ counsel had\n\ninstructed Adalian not to answer questions about damages because a Rule 30(b)(6) witness was\n\nbeing designated for that purpose. During a telephone conference on the record with the Court,\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel agreed that this was an inappropriate basis upon which to instruct Adalian not\n\nto answer questions. Accordingly, the Court ordered that Dr. Adalian’s deposition be continued\n\nso that Defendants could ask him questions relating to damages. Defendants did not request any\n\nsanctions at the time, and the Court did not award any sanctions.\n\n       With respect to the deposition of Mathevosian, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ emergency\n\nmotion to proceed upon written questions rather than by oral examination. See [64] Order (June\n\n23, 2009). The Court held that Defendants had established that it was important to depose her\n\nand that Plaintiffs had not substantiated their claims that she was too ill to be deposed.\n\nDefendants ultimately deposed Mathevosian at her home, and the videotape of that deposition\n\nwas presented to the Court as part of the record at trial. It is apparent from that video that she\n\nwas in poor health, and given the limited scope of the questioning from Defendants during that\n\ndeposition, it was reasonable for Plaintiffs to ask the Court to limit the method of questioning.\n\n       Defendants have seized upon these two incidents during discovery as evidence of\n\nPlaintiffs’ vexatiousness. However, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs’ counsel acted\n\nrecklessly or in bad faith in taking these actions. Accordingly, the Court declines to award a\n\nsanction of attorneys’ fees based on this conduct.\n\n               4.      Unnecessary Motions Practice\n\n       Defendants next argue that they should be awarded expenses because Plaintiffs filed\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fseveral unnecessary “motions” during the course of the litigation. First, Defendants complain\n\nabout a request for entry of default that was filed 35 days after Defendants failed to file an answer\n\nto Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint in Civil Action No. 07-1259. The Court denied\n\nPlaintiffs’ request for entry of default, agreeing with Defendants that default was inappropriate in\n\nlight of their participation in the lawsuit and the related actions pending before the Court.\n\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs filed their request only for the purpose of delay and harassment,\n\nbut they concede that Plaintiffs’ action was allowed by Rule 55. The Court declines to sanction\n\nPlaintiffs for taking an action that is explicitly authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.\n\n       Defendants next complain about Plaintiffs’ reference to Rule 11 in a footnote of their\n\nreply brief in support of summary judgment. See [79] Pls.’ Reply Mem. at 5 n.5. In that\n\nfootnote, Plaintiffs suggested that Defendants had improperly cited Delaware case law and\n\nsecondary sources in support of their breach of fiduciary duty claims. With leave of the Court,\n\nDefendants filed a surreply to respond to Plaintiffs’ suggestion. See [82] Defs.’ Surreply. The\n\nCourt agrees with Defendants that the reference to Rule 11 was unnecessary, but Defendants also\n\ndid not need to file a surreply to respond to Plaintiffs’ footnote.12 The Court shall not sanction\n\nPlaintiffs for asserting a legal argument that Defendants’ cited sources are not controlling\n\nauthority.\n\n       Finally, Defendants complain about a motion filed by Plaintiffs on the eve of trial asking\n\n\n\n       12\n         Plaintiffs did not file a motion for sanctions under Rule 11, and the Court did not\nconstrue Plaintiffs’ footnote as requesting that sanctions be imposed. In any event, it was\nobvious to the Court that Defendants’ citation of persuasive authority was not sanctionable\nconduct.\n\n                                                 47\n\fDefendants to certify that they had complied with certain discovery obligations. See [152] Pls.’\n\nMot. for Order Requiring Defs.’ Confirmation of Compliance with Discovery Obligations.\n\nPlaintiffs were seeking confirmation that Defendants had searched all of Cafesjian’s email\n\naddresses for discoverable information in light of new evidence of additional email accounts that\n\nsurfaced before trial. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ motion was unnecessary and vexatious\n\nbecause the parties were engaged in discussion about producing any outstanding materials before\n\ntrial. The Court ultimately denied the motion without prejudice after the parties appeared to have\n\nresolved the dispute through negotiation. While Plaintiffs should have been able to resolve their\n\ndisagreement with Defendants before filing a motion with the Court, the Court does not find that\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion was vexatious. The parties had legitimate disputes about last-minute discovery\n\nobligations, and Plaintiffs’ decision to file a motion with the Court was not clearly inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the Court shall not sanction Plaintiffs based on this conduct.\n\n               5.      Production of Documents on the Eve of Trial\n\n       Defendants’ final request for attorneys’ fees is based on the fact that Plaintiffs produced a\n\nlarge number of documents—some 12,000 pages of emails—less than two weeks before the start\n\nof the trial. Plaintiffs’ late production is troubling because these emails—many of which were\n\nultimately used by Defendants as important exhibits at trial—should have been produced prior to\n\nthe close of discovery pursuant to the Court’s scheduling order and prior rulings relating to the\n\nconsolidated discovery in these actions. By producing these documents on the eve of trial,\n\nPlaintiffs forced Defendants to spend a significant amount of time and resources reviewing these\n\nmaterials instead of preparing their witnesses, rehearsing their arguments, and otherwise\n\npreparing for a lengthy bench trial. Ultimately, it is unclear what impact Plaintiffs’ late\n\n\n                                                 48\n\fproduction had on Defendants’ ability to prepare for trial. Defendants did not ask for a\n\ncontinuance based on Plaintiffs’ late production, but it was not in Defendants’ interest to delay\n\nthe trial, so the Court cannot assume that Defendants were not prejudiced by the untimely\n\ndisclosures.\n\n       Based on the damning contents of many of the documents, Defendants speculate that\n\nPlaintiffs acted in bad faith and abused the discovery process by waiting until before trial to\n\nproduce them. Plaintiffs indicated to the Court that a computer problem had inadvertently caused\n\nthese documents to be omitted from its prior production of documents during discovery. See\n\n[170] Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. to Amend the Joint Pretrial Stmt. at 2. Plaintiffs’ former counsel\n\nhas presented the Court with a declaration indicating that he was unaware until October 2010 that\n\nadditional emails existed that had not been produced. See Decl. of Arnold E. Rosenfeld ¶ 11.\n\nWhile the Court is willing to accept the declaration of Plaintiffs’ former counsel as an officer of\n\nthe Court that documents were not deliberately withheld until the eve of trial by legal counsel, it\n\nis unclear whether Plaintiffs acted recklessly or otherwise breached their obligation to timely\n\nsupplement their discovery responses. Therefore, the Court shall require Plaintiffs to provide the\n\nCourt with a more specific explanation as to why they did not produce these documents during\n\ndiscovery. The Court may order payment of reasonable expenses caused by Plaintiffs’ untimely\n\nproduction pursuant to Rule 26(c)(1) if the Court is not satisfied with Plaintiffs’ response. The\n\nCourt shall hold in abeyance Defendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees with respect to the untimely\n\nproduction of these documents.\n\n       D.      Defendants’ Petition for Involuntarily Dissolution\n\n       On February 16, 2011, Defendants filed a [198] Petition for Involuntary Dissolution\n\n\n                                                 49\n\fasking this Court to begin the involuntarily dissolution of AGM&M pursuant to the procedures in\n\nthe District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act, D.C. Code §§ 29-301.01 to 301.114.\n\nPursuant to D.C. Code § 29-301.55, the Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n       The court shall have full power to liquidate the assets and affairs of a corporation:\n\n       (1) In any action by a member or director when it is made to appear:\n\n               (A) That the directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate\n               affairs and that irreparable injury to the corporation is being suffered or is\n               threatened by reason thereof, and either that the members are unable to break\n               the deadlock or there are no members having voting rights;\n\n               (B) That the acts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are\n               illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent;\n\n               (C) That the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or\n\n               (D) That the corporation is unable to carry out its purposes[.]\n\nD.C. Code § 29-301.55(a). The Nonprofit Corporation Act sets out specific procedures for\n\nliquidation proceedings. See id. §§ 29-301.55 to 301.60.\n\n       As the Court explained in a Memorandum Opinion and Order issued on February 17,\n\n2011, following passage of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act,\n\nPub. L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (1970), all powers over nonprofit corporation liquidation are\n\nvested in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. See [202] Mem. Op. & Order at 5-6.\n\nThe Court suggested, however, that it might be appropriate to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nover Defendants’ petition for involuntary dissolution, and the Court asked the parties to submit\n\nbriefing on this issue. Defendants filed a response to the Court’s order addressing the issue of\n\njurisdiction, and Plaintiffs have filed an opposition to Defendants’ petition, to which Defendants\n\nfiled a reply. Therefore, the issue is ripe for the Court’s resolution.\n\n\n                                                  50\n\f        The supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1367, provides that “the district courts\n\nshall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the\n\naction within [the courts’] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or\n\ncontroversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). However,\n\nthe statute provides that a court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where (1) the\n\nclaim raises a novel or complex issue of state law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over\n\nthe claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the court has\n\ndismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) in exceptional circumstances,\n\nthere are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction. Id. § 1367(c).\n\n        Many federal courts have recognized that claims for corporate dissolution involve special\n\nstate interests that may be disrupted or frustrated by the exercise of federal jurisdiction, and the\n\nexistence of state procedures for dissolution may require federal courts to abstain from exercising\n\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U.S. 176, 185 (1935) (“It has long been\n\naccepted practice for the federal courts to relinquish their jurisdiction in favor of the state courts,\n\nwhere its exercise would involve control of or interference with the internal affairs of a domestic\n\ncorporation of the state.”); Caudill v. Eubanks Farms, Inc., 301 F.3d 658, 661-65 (6th Cir. 2002)\n\n(affirming district court’s abstention from jurisdiction over corporate dissolution claim under\n\nBurford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943)); Friedman v. Revenue Mgmt. of N.Y., Inc., 38 F.3d\n\n668, 671 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing that the comprehensive regulation of corporate governance\n\nand existence by the state may warrant abstention under Burford); In re English Seafood (USA)\n\nInc., 743 F. Supp. 281, 288-89 (D. Del. 1990) (“We find that abstention is required in this case.\n\nThe state of Delaware has a strong interest in the formation and termination of corporations\n\n\n                                                  51\n\funder its laws and in the uniform development and application of the statutory scheme that the\n\nstate legislature and courts have created to regulate those corporations.”); see also Kermanshah v.\n\nKermanshah, 580 F. Supp. 2d 247, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing cases). Although there is some\n\nquestion whether similar principles should apply to the District of Columbia, see Silverman v.\n\nBarry, 727 F.2d 1121, 1123 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1984), there is some basis for considering the Superior\n\nCourt’s expertise in resolving these local issues, see Handy v. Shaw, Bransford, Veilleux & Roth,\n\n325 F.3d 346, 351-52 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the Court is reluctant to assert jurisdiction\n\nover a matter that is nearly always handled exclusively by the local courts of the District of\n\nColumbia.\n\n       Defendants argue that the Court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\npetition because the Court has already invested a substantial amount of time in this litigation and\n\nis familiar with the problems facing AGM&M. However, while the Court may be familiar with\n\nsome of the facts that are relevant to Defendants’ petition, Defendants did not assert this claim\n\nfor relief in their Streamlined Counterclaims or any of their pretrial briefs, and this claim was not\n\nlitigated by the parties at trial.13 Resolution of Defendants’ petition would require additional\n\nfindings of fact by the Court following “a hearing had upon such notice as the court may direct to\n\nbe given to all parties to the proceedings and to any other parties in interest designated by the\n\ncourt.”14 D.C. Code § 29-301.56(b). Such proceedings would likely occur after the Court has\n\n\n       13\n         By contrast, the plaintiffs in Miller v. Up In Smoke, Inc., 738 F. Supp. 2d 878 (N.D.\nInd. 2010), upon which Defendants rely, pled their alternative claim for judicial dissolution in the\ncomplaint. See id. at 866.\n       14\n           The Court notes that none of the present trustees of AGM&M were parties to this\nlitigation during the trial. Hirair Hovnanian was dismissed as a party at the summary judgment\nstage. Anoush Mathevosian and Van Krikorian have never been parties, although Van Krikorian\n\n                                                 52\n\ffinally disposed of the parties’ original claims, which is an additional reason to decline the\n\nexercise of supplemental jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). It is one thing to have the\n\nCourt exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim in the interest of judicial economy; it is\n\nanother thing entirely to seek to extend the Court’s jurisdiction by adding a completely new claim\n\nafter the trial has been held.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nDefendants’ [198] Petition for Involuntary Dissolution. Defendants should seek appropriate\n\nrelief from the Superior Court for the District of Columbia.\n\n        E.      Defendants’ Motion for Order to Show Cause as to Why Plaintiffs Should Not Be\n                Held in Comtempt\n\n        On March 21, 2011, Defendants filed a [214] Request for Order to Show Cause as to\n\nWhy Plaintiffs Should Not Be Held in Contempt. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have\n\nviolated one of this Court’s orders by relocating certain materials maintained by the Armenian\n\nNational Institute (“ANI”) off the premises of the Families U.S.A. building. Plaintiffs do not\n\ndispute that ANI has moved its materials out of the Families U.S.A. building, but they contend\n\nthat they should not be held in contempt because ANI is a separate legal entity that is not a party\n\nto this litigation and the Court did not expressly order it to keep its belongings in the Families\n\nU.S.A. building. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that there is no basis for finding them in\n\ncontempt.\n\n        Following the completion of closing arguments at trial, the Court asked the parties if they\n\n\nattended the trial as the corporate representative of the Assembly. According to Defendants, the\nCFF-designated trustee of AGM&M is now John Williams, Defendants’ trial counsel. It is\nunclear whether Mr. Williams could continue to represent Defendants through any dissolution\nproceedings in light of his present status as a trustee.\n\n                                                 53\n\fwould agree not to take any actions with respect to the properties pending the Court’s ruling.\n\nBecause the reversion date of December 31, 2010 was approaching soon after trial, the Court\n\nwanted assurances that the parties would not attempt to enforce the Grant Agreement or change\n\nthe status quo while the Court was in the process of deciding the case. Plaintiffs agreed that they\n\nwould wait until the Court’s ruling before taking action. Defendants also agreed that they would\n\nnot take any actions with respect to the buildings, but they raised a concern about “the ANI\n\nsituation,” referring to the materials being stored in the Families U.S.A. building and the staff\n\nworking there. See Trial Tr. (11/29) at 168. In response, the Court stated:\n\n       I would hope that while we await my decisions that nothing happens to them or they\n       get moved or anything else. I’d prefer not to enter an order because I’m sure—unless\n       you can reach an agreement about what both sides need to do. If you can reach some\n       stipulation or some sort of consent order, I’d be happy to sign something until I make\n       a decision.\n\nId. at 168-69. Defendants complained about the lack of an enforcement mechanism and asked\n\nfor a right of inspection. See id. at 170-71. The Court then inquired as to whether there was\n\ninventory of the materials kept by ANI, and Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the Court (after\n\nconferring with Dr. Rouben Adalian, who was present in the courtroom), that there was not a\n\nprecise inventory. Id. at 171. Plaintiffs’ counsel told the Court that nothing had happened to the\n\nmaterials for a long time since the litigation began, and Plaintiffs agreed that nothing should\n\nhappen to them pending the Court’s decision. The Court then told the parties several times that\n\nthey should try to reach an agreement about this issue before asking the Court to enter an order:\n\n       Let me make the suggestion, in order to enter some sort of order you either have to\n       agree to it or you need to file something in terms of what my authority would be.\n       ANI, technically, is not a party, although they are under you, it’s under the umbrella\n       of [AGM&M], I’d have to take a look at that more carefully. So, I’m just saying that\n       this is not something I would do off the top of my head. If you can reach some\n\n\n                                                 54\n\f       agreement that just simply says nothing gets moved by anybody that relates to this\n       until I make this decision, that would be helpful. Once I make a decision, I will bring\n       you back to have some discussion further.\n\n       ...\n\n       [I]f you can agree to something, that would be most helpful. Just leave everybody\n       with nobody moving or doing anything, that would be helpful. If you can’t do that\n       and you still feel strongly, then file something and then I’ll take a look at it. I prefer\n       not to put my resources into that. But why don’t you have a discussion about it.\n\n       ...\n\n       As I said, I would prefer that you have discussion about it, see if you can resolve\n       something. If you want me to sign something, fine. Reach a stipulation, however\n       you want to do it. If you can’t, then you need to file something. I’m not going to do\n       it today without your filing something in writing.\n\n       ...\n\n       [W]hat I’m asking is nobody move anything. I mean, in other words, we’ve\n       been—you’ve been on pause while we’ve been waiting for this for at least—at least\n       for a couple of years at the end [of the] year. So, don’t change anything. I mean, you\n       can accept new donations, but don’t move the property or make changes to the thing.\n       To the extent that you want to put something—stipulate that nobody—either side is\n       going to do anything, then that would be helpful. But I’ll do this as fast as I can. But\n       if you’re not satisfied, then file something in writing and I’ll litigate it. But I would\n       suggest that you talk and see whether you can do it on a more amicable basis.\n\nId. at 171-75. The parties did not present any stipulation or agreement to the Court for\n\nratification, nor did the parties file any motions asking the Court to enter an Order.\n\n       Defendants argue that the removal of the ANI materials from the Families U.S.A.\n\nbuilding, which apparently occurred after the Court issued its Memorandum Opinion on January\n\n26, 2011, violated the Court’s oral admonition that “nobody move anything.” However, as\n\nshould have been clear from the context, the Court’s statement was not intended to constitute a\n\n\n\n\n                                                  55\n\fbinding order on ANI.15 Even if the Court had intended to impose a binding obligation, ANI’s\n\nactions would not justify a finding of contempt. The record presented by Plaintiffs demonstrates\n\nthat ANI waited until after the Court issued its January 26, 2011 Memorandum Opinion before\n\nmoving its materials to an offsite storage facility, where they remain under the supervision of Dr.\n\nAdalian. See Decl. of Dr. Rouben Adalian ¶¶ 3-6, 11, 14. Therefore, there is no basis to\n\nconclude that ANI’s assets have been wasted.\n\n       For these reasons, the Court finds that there is no basis for holding Plaintiffs in contempt,\n\nand the Court shall deny Defendants’ request for a show cause order.\n\n                                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Grant Agreement clearly and\n\nunambiguously requires AGM&M to transfer the Bank Building and the Adjacent Properties to\n\nCFF without any reimbursement requirement and without regard to any tax consequences that\n\nmight result from the transfer. Therefore, the Court shall order AGM&M to effect the transfer of\n\nthe properties without further delay in compliance with D.C. law. The Court reaffirms its ruling\n\nthat Cafesjian and Waters are entitled to indemnification from AGM&M for their attorneys’ fees\n\nin defending the claims asserted against them for breaching their fiduciary duty to AGM&M, but\n\nthe Court shall refer this issue to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation. The\n\nmagistrate judge shall review the expenses submitted by Defendants and make recommendations\n\nas to which of the claimed expenses should be subject to indemnification; the Court shall review\n\nthe magistrate judge’s report and recommendation and make a final ruling as to the amount of the\n\n\n       15\n         This Court has never determined that ANI is a party to this litigation or that AGM&M\nor the Assembly has control over ANI. The record at trial indicated only that the AGM&M\nBoard of Trustees had the right to appoint the Board of Governors of ANI.\n\n                                                56\n\findemnification. The Court shall also deny-in-part Defendants’ [221] Motion Requesting\n\nAttorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation because Defendants have mostly failed to demonstrate\n\nthat Plaintiffs or their counsel acted recklessly or in bad faith. However, the Court shall hold in\n\nabeyance Defendants’ motion with respect to Plaintiffs’ untimely production of documents on the\n\neve of trial and require Plaintiffs to more clearly explain why they did not produce these\n\ndocuments during discovery.\n\n       The Court shall decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Defendants’ [198]\n\nPetition for Involuntary Dissolution of AGM&M, as this is a new claim asserted after trial that is\n\nbest left to be adjudicated by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n\n       Finally, the Court shall deny Defendants’ [214] Request for Order to Show Cause as to\n\nWhy Plaintiffs Should Not Be Held In Contempt because Defendants have not shown that\n\nPlaintiffs violated one of this Court’s orders.\n\n       Because the Court has now finally disposed of all the parties’ claims except for\n\ndetermining the amount of indemnification, the Court shall direct entry of final judgment\n\npursuant to Rule 54(b) as to all claims except for Defendants’ claim for legal fees and expenses\n\nunder the indemnification provision of the AGM&M By-Laws (Count VII of their Streamlined\n\nCounterclaims). An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\nDate: May 9, 2011                                              /s/\n                                                       COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                                       United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                  57\n\f",

CAFESJIAN, et al.,\n\n    Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                      (May 9, 2011)\n\n       The above-captioned consolidated actions involve a series of claims and counterclaims\n\nrelating to the parties’ attempts to create a museum and memorial in Washington, D.C. devoted\n\nto the Armenian Genocide.1 Following a twelve-day bench trial in November 2010, the Court\n\nissued a Memorandum Opinion setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law on\n\nJanuary 26, 2011. See [193]2 Mem. Op. (Jan. 26, 2011). The Court found that none of the\n\nparties’ substantive claims were meritorious and dismissed all of the claims save one, holding\n\nthat Defendants Gerard L. Cafesjian (“Cafesjian”) and John J. Waters (“Waters”) were entitled to\n\nindemnification from the Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial, Inc. (“AGM&M”) for\n\nlegal expenses incurred in defending claims asserted against them in their capacities as former\n\nofficers of AGM&M. The Court also upheld the validity of a reversion clause in a Grant\n\n\n       1\n          As the Court has previously noted, the use of the term “genocide” to describe the\natrocities that befell the Armenians between 1915 and 1923 is not without controversy. The\nCourt employs the term used as by the parties, and the Court expresses no opinion on the\npropriety of that label.\n       2\n           All docket numbers refer to Civil Action No. 08-255.\n\fAgreement executed between Defendants Cafesjian and the Cafesjian Family Foundation, Inc.\n\n(“CFF”) and Plaintiff Armenian Assembly of America, Inc. (the “Assembly”), ruling that CFF\n\nand Cafesjian may exercise their rights under that clause effective December 31, 2010. The\n\nCourt asked the parties to submit additional briefing regarding two issues left unresolved by the\n\nCourt’s prior Memorandum Opinion: (1) whether CFF should be required to reimburse AGM&M\n\nfor part of the value of properties that shall be transferred to CFF under the terms of the Grant\n\nAgreement; and (2) the amount of legal expenses for which Cafesjian and Waters are entitled to\n\nbe indemnified. The parties have now completed the additional briefing on these issues as\n\nordered by the Court, and these issues are ripe for the Court’s resolution. This Memorandum\n\nOpinion contains the Court’s final findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to these\n\nissues. The parties have also filed a series of papers with the Court regarding the terms on which\n\nthe properties must be transferred to CFF. The Court shall address these filings in the context of\n\naddressing the reimbursement issue.\n\n       Pending also before the Court are several additional motions filed by Defendants\n\nCafesjian, Waters, and CFF (collectively, “Defendants”). First, Defendants have filed a [198]\n\nPetition for Involuntary Dissolution asking the Court to initiate procedures to involuntarily\n\ndissolve AGM&M under D.C. law. Second, Defendants have filed a [221] Motion Requesting\n\nAttorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation. Third, Defendants have filed a [214] Request for Order\n\nto Show Cause as to Why Plaintiffs Should Not Be Held In Contempt for allegedly violating one\n\nof this Court’s orders. The Assembly and AGM&M (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) have filed\n\noppositions to each of these motions, and Defendants have filed replies. In addition, Plaintiffs’\n\nformer counsel, K&L Gates LLP, has intervened and filed a brief opposing Defendants’ motion\n\n\n                                                 2\n\ffor attorneys’ fees for vexatious litigation. Accordingly, these motions are all ripe for resolution.\n\n       For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that the Grant Agreement does not\n\nimpose any obligation on CFF to reimburse AGM&M for the excess value of the properties over\n\nthe amount of the funds originally donated. Therefore, the Court shall enter final judgment on\n\nthis issue and order AGM&M to transfer the properties to CFF without further delay. With\n\nrespect to the amount of legal fees and expenses subject to the indemnification clause covering\n\nCafesjian and Waters, the Court shall refer this issue to a magistrate judge for a report and\n\nrecommendation. The Court shall deny-in-part Defendants’ motion requesting attorneys’ fees for\n\nvexatious litigation because Defendants have mostly failed to demonstrate that Plaintiffs or their\n\ncounsel acted recklessly or in bad faith; however, the Court shall hold in abeyance Defendants’\n\nmotion with respect to Plaintiffs’ untimely production of documents on the eve of trial. The\n\nCourt shall decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Defendants’ petition for\n\ninvoluntary dissolution of AGM&M, as this is a new claim asserted after trial that is best left to\n\nbe adjudicated by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Finally, the Court shall deny\n\nDefendants’ request for a show cause order because Defendants have not shown that Plaintiffs\n\nviolated one of this Court’s orders.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Court set out its factual findings thoroughly in its Memorandum Opinion issued on\n\nJanuary 26, 2011, and the Court assumes familiarity with that opinion and incorporates it here.\n\nSee Armenian Assembly of Am., Inc. v. Cafesjian, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">229354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(D.D.C. Jan. 26, 2011). The Court shall summarize the facts previously found by the Court to\n\nthe extent they are relevant to the issues remaining to be decided.\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       A.      Initial Interest in an Armenian Genocide Museum and the Acquisition of the\n               National Bank of Washington Building\n\n       In the late 1990s, Cafesjian and several individuals involved with the Assembly joined\n\nforces in an effort to create a museum devoted to memorializing the Armenian Genocide. On or\n\nabout April 1, 1996, Hirair Hovnanian (“Hovnanian”), one of the Assembly’s founders, made a\n\npledge of about $1.6 million to establish the Armenian National Institute (“ANI”) for the study,\n\nresearch, and affirmation of the Armenian Genocide. Dr. Rouben Adalian (“Adalian”), a\n\nhistorical researcher, was hired to become the director of ANI. Inspired by Hovnanian’s pledge,\n\nAnoush Mathevosian (“Mathevosian”) decided in 1996 to pledge $3 million to be used for the\n\npurpose of constructing a permanent museum in Washington, D.C. dedicated to the victims and\n\nsurvivors of the Armenian Genocide. In 1996, the Assembly began to explore properties in\n\nWashington, D.C. that would be suitable for a museum. Around this same time, Cafesjian was\n\nindependently planning to build a memorial to the Armenian Genocide. Through his trusted\n\nassociate Waters, Cafesjian contacted the Assembly and expressed an interest in potentially\n\nassociating his planned memorial with the Assembly’s museum project. Because Cafesjian had\n\nnot been involved in the Assembly, he invited Hovnanian, Adalian, and Robert Aram Kaloosdian\n\n(“Kaloosdian”), another of the Assembly’s founders, to meet with him and discuss the museum\n\nproject and the Assembly’s advocacy efforts. Cafesjian officially joined the Assembly as a\n\ntrustee in August 1998. At that point in time, Cafesjian and Waters continued to search\n\nseparately for a location for a memorial.\n\n       In or about late 1999, the Assembly identified the National Bank of Washington, located\n\nat 619 14th Street, NW, Washington, D.C., as a possible site for the museum. Although it was\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fmuch larger than the properties they had been looking at to date, everyone involved in the search\n\nwas impressed by the National Bank of Washington building (the “Bank Building”). The Bank\n\nBuilding has a prime location—just blocks from the White House—and its exterior and part of\n\nthe interior have been designated as historic landmarks in the D.C. Inventory of Historic Sites\n\nand the National Register of Historic Places. The property on which the Bank Building is located\n\nalso includes a vacant back lot which would allow for the construction of an annex. Cafesjian\n\nwas very interested in the Bank Building, and he dispatched Waters to do due diligence on the\n\nproperty. Because there was another interested buyer, Cafesjian directed Waters to work quickly\n\nto arrange the purchase. Cafesjian agreed to donate $3.5 million to the Assembly to create a\n\nconsolidated location at which the genocide museum, the genocide memorial, and offices for\n\nANI could be located. Anoush Mathevosian agreed to increase her pledge to $3.5 million to\n\nacquire the property.\n\n       The Assembly closed on the Bank Building on February 16, 2000, purchasing the\n\nbuilding for $7.25 million. The funds for the purchase were comprised of a $3.5 million pledge\n\nfrom Mathevosian, a $2.5 million grant from CFF, and a $1 million grant from Cafesjian’s\n\nVanguard Charitable Endowment Program - Cafesjian Family Foundation Charitable Trust.\n\nBecause Mathevosian could not access funds in sufficient time to wire them to the Assembly\n\nprior to the closing, CFF provided the Assembly with a $4 million interest-free bridge loan to\n\ncover Mathevosian’s pledge and to complete the transaction. On March 8, 2000, after the\n\nAssembly had received Mathevosian’s pledged donation, the Assembly repaid CFF $3.5 million\n\nby wire transfer. On March 17, 2000, the Assembly executed a promissory note produced by and\n\nfor the benefit of CFF for the remaining $500,000.\n\n\n                                                5\n\f       After the closing, on February 28, 2000, Anoush Mathevosian wrote a letter to the\n\nAssembly restating the purpose of her pledge. The letter stated that the purpose of her gift was to\n\nfoster the development of an Armenian Genocide museum with educational exhibits, and\n\nMathevosian expressed her desire that the Bank Building be used solely for the Assembly, ANI,\n\nthe museum, and the memorial. She wrote:\n\n       To be certain that future generations remain true to the intent of our donations, it\n       should be clear that no changes will be made to the purpose and usage of the\n       Museum; that no mortgages are taken against the property and that the Museum’s\n       perpetuation is not jeopardized as such or encumbered in any way; and that there will\n       be no subsequent changes to the name of the museum.\n\nPX-110. At her deposition, Mathevosian explained that she wanted to ensure that they paid for\n\nthe property in full so that it would not be mortgaged or sold in the future. Mathevosian asked\n\nthat these understandings be incorporated into the permanent records of the organization.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Mathevosian’s expressed desires were ever formally\n\nincorporated by the Assembly into a binding obligation. Mathevosian testified that Hovnanian\n\nagreed to her conditions, but she did not recall whether he had done so orally or in writing. John\n\nWaters testified that he did not see Mathevosian’s letter until several years later, in late 2003. In\n\nany case, Mathevosian did not ask for a reversionary interest in her donation, and therefore she\n\ndoes not have one.\n\n       The parties agreed that as a condition of Cafesjian’s donation of funds for the purchase of\n\nthe Bank Building, the Assembly was required to include a memorial named after Cafesjian as\n\npart of the project. On March 30, 2000, the Assembly sent Cafesjian a letter confirming his\n\ndonations and its obligation to build a memorial. The Assembly agreed to cooperate with the\n\ndesign firm or artist chosen by CFF to complete the memorial. The anticipated completion date\n\n\n                                                  6\n\ffor the project was March 2002, and CFF agreed to make contributions to the Assembly to\n\nfinance the memorial. Because of the size of the Bank Building (34,000 sq. ft) and the property\n\non which it sits, it was contemplated that the Assembly and ANI would move out of their\n\nexisting offices when their lease expired in March 2002 and occupy space on the new site.\n\nAccordingly, it was agreed that the development of suitable office space on the property would\n\nbe a priority. Ross Vartian, then-Executive Director for the Assembly, testified at trial that in\n\nretrospect, they were naïve to think that the museum, the memorial, and offices for the Assembly\n\nand ANI could all be housed within the Bank Building.\n\n       B.      Acquisition of the Properties Adjacent to the Bank Building\n\n       Once the Bank Building was acquired by the Assembly, Cafesjian began to acquire\n\nproperties adjacent to the Bank Building. Ultimately, Cafesjian decided to donate the properties\n\nto the Assembly for the purpose of expanding the footprint of the museum project.\n\n       Cafesjian acquired four parcels adjacent to the Bank Building: (1) 1342 G Street, NW; (2)\n\n1340 G Street, NW; (3) 1338 G Street, NW; and (4) 1334-36 G Street, NW (collectively, the\n\n“Adjacent Properties”). Each of the properties was acquired in an arms-length transaction by one\n\nof Cafesjian’s entities, TomKat Limited Partnership (“TomKat”). TomKat executed an\n\nagreement to purchase 1338 G Street for $1.2 million on March 10, 2000 and closed on May 15,\n\n2000. TomKat purchased 1342 G Street for $1.2 million on March 16, 2000 and closed on\n\nSeptember 30, 2000. On October 24, 2000, TomKat entered into an Installment Purchase and\n\nSale Agreement to purchase 1340 G Street for a total of $3 million. Under the installment\n\nagreement, payments of $150,000 were due each year for a period of ten years, with a final\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fballoon payment of $1.5 million due in March 2011.3 The final adjacent property, 1334-46 G\n\nStreet, NW, also known as the “Families U.S.A.” building, was acquired later by TomKat, which\n\npurchased the building from a third-party seller for $6.5 million in September 2003.\n\n       C.      Initial Efforts to Develop the Museum and Memorial\n\n       A planning committee was formed to handle the task of developing the Bank Building\n\ninto a museum and memorial. The planning committee operated largely by consensus, and there\n\nwere about a dozen different individuals who became involved to varying degrees in the planning\n\nfor the project. Although the committee held several meetings in the spring of 2000 to discuss\n\ndevelopment plans and fundraising, there was no dedicated staff to shepherd the project along,\n\nand the lack of a central decision maker slowed the pace of progress considerably. In 2001, Ross\n\nVartian took on the position of planning director for the project, but the committee was unable to\n\nagree on critical decisions such as how to go about hiring professionals to work on the building\n\nand how to raise funds to cover the costs of construction and operation. The biggest obstacle was\n\ndisagreement over the size and scope of the project, including uncertainty over how Cafesjian’s\n\nacquisition of the Adjacent Properties would affect the development of the museum.\n\n       It was around late summer 2001 when Cafesjian agreed to donate the Adjacent Properties\n\nto be used for the genocide museum project. No official proposal was made to the Assembly\n\nuntil October 15, 2001, when Cafesjian wrote a letter to Hovnanian outlining the terms of a\n\nproposed grant of the three properties that had been acquired. This letter was the first in a series\n\nof draft grant agreements that would ultimately be exchanged between Cafesjian and the\n\n\n\n       3\n       In a Status Report filed on May 5, 2011, Defendants indicated that all payments had\nbeen made under the installment agreement and that title had been transferred to CFF.\n\n                                                  8\n\fAssembly. The letter proposed that Cafesjian and/or CFF donate $5.8 million to the Assembly to\n\npurchase the properties from TomKat. The proposed grant agreement would require the\n\nAssembly to use the properties solely as part of the genocide museum project, subject to plans\n\napproved by the Assembly’s planning committee. The letter also proposed that if the Assembly\n\nfailed to develop the property according to those plans, CFF would be entitled to a return of\n\neither the grant funds or the properties. Cafesjian expressed his frustration with the lack of\n\nprogress that had been made, and he explained at trial that he wanted to make certain that the\n\nmuseum was built during his lifetime.\n\n       Cafesjian’s proposal was generally well received at the Assembly, although the Assembly\n\nnever responded in writing to Cafesjian’s letter. However, there was no meaningful progress\n\nthroughout the rest of 2001. In 2002, the parties continued to discuss various development\n\nproposals and there was some progress. In March 2002, the Assembly determined that an\n\nindependent entity should be created to develop and operate the museum project. CFF and the\n\nAssembly also agreed to combine their conditions with prior gifting commitments, which the\n\nnewly-formed independent entity would be obliged to honor. CFF and the Assembly agreed to\n\njointly design and approve the governing documents for the new entity, which would become\n\nknown as the Armenian Genocide Museum & Memorial, Inc. (“AGM&M”). It was agreed that\n\nAGM&M would be incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization as soon as it was possible to do so\n\nresponsibly and sustainably. The parties also decided that the Assembly offices would not be\n\nhoused within any portion of the museum complex, in part to keep the museum independent from\n\nany advocacy organization and in part because it was thought that there would not be adequate\n\nspace in the complex for the Assembly. To ensure that the Assembly would get sufficient credit\n\n\n                                                 9\n\ffor launching the museum (and to combat the perception that the Assembly was abandoning the\n\nproject), Cafesjian and Hovnanian agreed to channel their contributions through the Assembly.\n\n       In August 2002, the planning committee met and discussed a revised draft grant\n\nagreement letter from CFF. Like the previous draft grant agreement sent in October 2001, it\n\ncontained a reversion clause stating that if the three adjacent properties were not developed in\n\naccordance with a plan approved by the AGM&M (with the necessary approval of CFF), CFF\n\nwould be entitled to a return of either those adjacent properties or the funds used to purchase\n\nthem. There was some discussion at the meeting that such an open-ended reversion clause would\n\nnot be appropriate.\n\n       The museum project was facing significant cash flow problems over the course of 2002,\n\nand Cafesjian had agreed to advance funds necessary for work to be completed in that year. In\n\nOctober 2002, the museum planning committee convened a meeting in New York and engaged in\n\nan extensive discussion about the finances for the project. Hovnanian expressed his concern that\n\nthey would be unable to raise enough money to fund a project with a $100 million budget, and he\n\nraised the possibility of phasing in the project, with later expansion tied to better economic\n\ncircumstances. Others also expressed concerns about the operating deficit. Waters told the\n\ncommittee that Cafesjian was optimistic that the funds could be raised from the community and\n\nthat, if necessary, Cafesjian was prepared to donate $50-75 million to ensure that the project was\n\ncompleted. According to one draft summary of the meeting, “[a]ll felt that G. Cafesjian’s\n\ncommitment, characterized as a ‘safety net,’ alleviated the fiscal concerns.” DX-67 at 2. The\n\nplanning committee members did reach some agreements about how best to move forward, but\n\nthe committee remained focused on consensus-based decision-making.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       On January 22, 2003, CFF sent a revised draft grant letter to the Assembly for review. As\n\nwith the previous drafts, the letter contained a reversion clause, but this time it contained a\n\ntriggering date: if the three donated adjacent properties were not developed according to plans\n\napproved by AGM&M by December 31, 2008, then those properties (or the cash used to acquire\n\nthem) would revert to CFF. The letter also provided that a new $500,000 promissory note would\n\nbe issued to CFF by the Assembly to replace the previous one, and that the obligation may be\n\ntransferred to AGM&M. The letter proposed that decisions of the AGM&M Board of Trustees\n\nbe decided by an 80% affirmative vote. This draft letter was discussed at a meeting in Delray,\n\nFlorida, where Hovnanian, Vartian, Kaloosdian, and Adalian were present. The Assembly Board\n\nof Trustees held another annual meeting in Boca Raton on March 1, 2003. By the time of this\n\nmeeting, everyone agreed that AGM&M should be launched as an independent entity with a\n\nbudget of around $100 million and a new building constructed on the Bank Building and the\n\nthree adjacent properties to be donated by Cafesjian. It was also agreed that ANI would retain its\n\nstatus as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, but that it would become a subsidiary of the new\n\nmuseum entity.\n\n       D.      Final Negotiation of the Grant Agreements and the Creation of AGM&M\n\n       It took seven months following the March 2003 meeting to finalize the agreements and\n\ngoverning documents that would create AGM&M. One reason for the delay was the acquisition\n\nof the fourth adjacent property, the Families U.S.A. building. Through TomKat, Cafesjian\n\nentered into a purchase agreement to buy the property for $6.5 million on September 22, 2003.\n\nThe closing date was scheduled for October 30, 2003.\n\n       The draft grant agreement from Cafesjian continued to be discussed and negotiated.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fBecause Cafesjian had agreed to channel his donations to AGM&M through the Assembly, it\n\nwas decided that Cafesjian would enter a grant agreement with the Assembly (hereinafter, the\n\n“Grant Agreement”), and the Assembly would transfer all of the museum-related assets and\n\nobligations to AGM&M in a separate agreement, to be known as the “Transfer Agreement.” The\n\nlaw firm of Caplin & Drysdale was hired to draft the Transfer Agreement as well as the organic\n\ndocuments for AGM&M, including the Articles of Incorporation, the By-Laws, and a Unanimous\n\nWritten Consent agreement signed by all of the initial trustees of AGM&M.\n\n       The record shows that the language in the Grant Agreement was reviewed by most of the\n\nmajor figures involved in AGM&M during the months leading up to its execution on November\n\n1, 2003. On October 13, 2003, Waters emailed an updated draft of the Grant Agreement, which\n\nincluded the donation of the Families U.S.A. building, for review. The revised draft also\n\nincluded a new trigger date of December 31, 2010 for the reversion clause; it was felt that seven\n\nyears was a reasonable timeline for the completion of the project. The reversion clause was also\n\nexpanded to cover the Bank Building in addition to the four Adjacent Properties. Because the\n\nFamilies U.S.A. building transaction was scheduled to close on October 30, Waters urged\n\neveryone to act expeditiously so that title to the building could be transferred directly to\n\nAGM&M, eliminating the need to transfer the property from TomKat to AGM&M and saving\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in transfer and recordation fees. On October 28, 2003, a\n\nconference call was held with, inter alia, Hovnanian, Cafesjian, Kaloosdian, Waters, and Vartian\n\nto discuss the four key documents: the Grant Agreement, the Articles of Incorporation for\n\nAGM&M, the AGM&M By-Laws, and the Unanimous Written Consent agreement. During this\n\nmeeting, Kaloosdian suggested that the language in the reversion clause in the Grant Agreement\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fbe clarified so as to avoid ambiguity about when the right of reversion might be triggered. The\n\nfinal language of these documents was approved shortly after this conference call.\n\n       The Court noted in its prior Memorandum Opinion that several individuals involved in\n\nthese discussions, including Kaloosdian and Hovnanian, had a convenient lack of memory with\n\nrespect to what transpired. Therefore, the Court relied heavily on documents that were submitted\n\nas exhibits to determine the events in question. The Court also noted that it appeared as if these\n\nindividuals did not take the time to fully understand the terms and conditions of the agreements.\n\nAny claim that these individuals had certain intentions with regard to these documents is\n\ndisingenuous and belied by the language of the documents themselves.\n\n       The Articles of Incorporation for AGM&M were signed on October 29, 2003, and\n\nAGM&M officially became incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws for AGM&M were ratified and adopted,\n\nrespectively, pursuant to the Unanimous Written Consent agreement, which was executed on\n\nOctober 30, 2003. The Grant Agreement and Transfer Agreement were signed on November 1,\n\n2003 during an Assembly gala in Palm Desert, California. Because the content of these\n\ndocuments is critically important to disputed issues in this litigation, the Court shall review each\n\nof these documents in some detail.\n\n               1.      The Grant Agreement\n\n       The Grant Agreement was signed by Cafesjian on behalf of himself and CFF and by\n\nHovnanian and Peter Vosbikian on behalf of the Assembly. See DX-2 (hereinafter, “Grant\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fAgreement”).4 The eleven-page document sets forth the terms and conditions of the grants made\n\nby Cafesjian and CFF to the Assembly for the museum project and obligates the Assembly to\n\ncomply with those terms and conditions.\n\n          Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, Cafesjian and/or CFF (jointly defined as the “Grantor”)\n\nagreed to donate $10.3 million for the purchase of the Adjacent Properties from TomKat and any\n\nrelated transaction costs. In addition, Cafesjian and/or CFF agreed to make the annual $150,000\n\npayments under the installment agreement for 1340 G Street and the final balloon payment of\n\n$1.5 million due in March 2011. See Grant Agreement §§ 2(D)-(E). The amounts paid under the\n\nGrant Agreement were calculated based on the purchase price paid by TomKat for the Adjacent\n\nProperties, plus the holding costs paid by TomKat pending transfer minus any rents earned\n\nduring this period, plus the legal costs associated with the transfer.\n\n          For purposes of this litigation, the most critical feature of the Grant Agreement is the\n\nreversion clause. Under § 3.1 of the Grant Agreement, the “Grant Property”—defined as the\n\nBank Building and the Adjacent Properties—“may only be used as part of the AGM&M,[5]\n\nsubject to plans for the AGM&M approved by the Board of Trustees of the American Genocide\n\nMuseum & Memorial, Inc. (the ‘Plans’) . . . .” Grant Agreement § 3.1(A). The next section\n\nreads as follows:\n\n          If the Grant Property is not developed prior to December 31, 2010 in accordance with\n          the Plans, or if the Grant Property is not developed in substantial compliance with the\n          Plans including with respect to the deadlines for completion of the construction,\n\n\n          4\n        A duplicate copy of this exhibit with some handwriting on the second page was\nadmitted as PX-112.\n          5\n              As used in this context, “AGM&M” refers to the museum project, not the corporate\nentity.\n\n                                                    14\n\f         renovation, installation and other phases detailed in the Plans, then:\n                (i)     in the event any portion of the Grants has not been funded, this\n                        Agreement terminates;\n                (ii)    to the degree any portion of the Grants has been funded, at the\n                        Grantor’s sole discretion, the Assembly shall return to the Grantor the\n                        Grant funds or transfer to the Grantor the Grant Property.\n\nId. § 3.1(B). The phrase “Grant funds” as referenced in the reversion clause includes both the\n\ninitial grant of $4 million that was used to acquire the Bank Building as well as the $12.85\n\nmillion pledged to acquire the Adjacent Properties. Cafesjian testified that the purpose of the\n\nreversion clause was to provide an incentive to complete the museum expeditiously, so that it\n\nmight be built before Cafesjian died. Waters testified that the reversion clause was most likely\n\nhis idea; he explained that CFF often inserted reversion clauses into its grant agreements.\n\nSection 3.3 of the Grant Agreement requires the Assembly to use the “Grant funds only for\n\npurposes described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.” Id.\n\n§ 3.3.\n\n         The Grant Agreement provides that the Assembly shall make available a space for a\n\nmemorial to be named the “Gerard L. Cafesjian Memorial” or another name approved by CFF,\n\nwhich shall be operated and maintained in perpetuity by the Assembly at its own cost. Grant\n\nAgreement § 3.2. The Grant Agreement also provides that neither CFF nor Cafesjian have any\n\nobligation to provide additional funding to the Assembly or to AGM&M. Id. § 3.8. The Grant\n\nAgreement also contains a breach clause:\n\n         (A)    If the Assembly fails to use the Grants solely for the purposes set out in this\n                Agreement or if the Assembly fails to satisfy any of the conditions of this\n                Agreement, Grantor is released from any remaining obligation under this\n                Agreement to provide funds or property to the Assembly.\n         (B)    If the Assembly uses any portion of the Grants either for a purpose other than\n                those set out in this Agreement or for a purpose other than those described in\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f               Section 501(c)(3) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, as amended, the Assembly\n               shall repay the portion of the Grants so spent to Grantor, plus interest.\n       (C)     The remedies set out in this Section 3.9 are in addition to any other remedies\n               that may be available to the Grantor at law or equity.\n\nGrant Agreement § 3.9.\n\n       The Grant Agreement also required the Assembly to enter into a Transfer Agreement with\n\nAGM&M to transfer all of its interest in all cash, pledges, property, and other assets being held\n\nby the Assembly for the museum project. Id. § 5.3(A). The Transfer Agreement would obligate\n\nAGM&M to honor all existing donor requirements at the time of transfer and to assume all\n\nobligations in the Grant Agreement relating to the Memorial. Id. § 5.3(B)-(C). The Grant\n\nAgreement also provided that the Assembly would assign its right to appoint the Trustees of the\n\nArmenian National Institute to AGM&M. Id. § 5.5.\n\n               2.      The Transfer Agreement\n\n       The Transfer Agreement was executed on November 1, 2003 by the Assembly and the\n\nnewly-incorporated AGM&M. See PX-114 (hereinafter, the “Transfer Agreement”). The\n\nTransfer Agreement requires the Assembly to contribute to AGM&M “all of its rights, title and\n\ninterest in and to all cash, pledges, real property, tangible property, intangible property, and other\n\nassets contributed to the [Assembly] and/or held by the [Assembly] for the development,\n\nrenovation, and construction of the AGM&M.” Id. § 1.1. The approximate aggregate value of\n\nthe grant was listed as $27.8 million, including $7.25 million in property, over $19 million in\n\npledges, and approximately $670,000 in cash and other assets. Id. § 1.1(C).\n\n       Pursuant to § 1.2 of the Transfer Agreement, “AGM&M, Inc. must honor all of the\n\n[Assembly]’s donor requirements existing at time of transfer, or in the alternative, obtain donor\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fconsent to the transfer and any modification of donor terms.” Transfer Agreement § 1.2(A). The\n\nagreement also explicitly requires AGM&M to comply with the obligation to construct a\n\nmemorial as set out in the Grant Agreement. Id. § 1.2(B). The Transfer Agreement also requires\n\nAGM&M to use the funds and property transferred “solely to develop, construct and operate” the\n\nArmenian Genocide Museum & Memorial. Id. § 1.3. The agreement also contains an arbitration\n\nclause. See Transfer Agreement § 5.3. However, as the Court noted in its prior Memorandum\n\nOpinion, none of the parties is presently seeking to enforce that arbitration clause.\n\n               3.      The AGM&M Articles of Incorporation\n\n       The Articles of Incorporation for AGM&M were executed on October 29, 2003. See PX-\n\n121. The Articles provide that AGM&M is a nonprofit corporation organized for charitable\n\npurposes within the meaning of § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Id., Art. IV(A). The\n\npurpose of the corporation is defined as, inter alia, “to own, operate, and maintain a permanent\n\nmuseum and memorial to the victims and survivors of the Armenian Genocide.” Id. The\n\nArticles provide that AGM&M has no members and that the board of directors for the\n\ncorporation shall be referred to as the Board of Trustees. See id., Arts. V-VI. The manner of\n\nelection or appointment to the Board of Trustees is to be set forth in the By-Laws of the\n\ncorporation. Id., Art. VI. The Board of Trustees must have at least three trustees at all times, and\n\nthe initial trustees are defined to be Gerard L. Cafesjian, Hirair Hovnanian, Anoush Mathevosian,\n\nand Robert Kaloosdian. Id., Art. IX. The Articles also provide that “[n]o part of the net earnings\n\nof the Corporation shall inure to the benefit of or be distributed to any trustee, employee or other\n\nindividual, partnership, estate, trust or corporation having a personal or private interest in the\n\nCorporation.” Id., Art. IV(C).\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f                4.      The AGM&M By-Laws\n\n        The By-Laws of AGM&M set out rules that govern the operation of the Board of\n\nTrustees. See PX-122 (hereinafter, “By-Laws”). The By-Laws provide that the term of office of\n\neach of the initial trustees (i.e., Cafesjian, Mathevosian, Hovnanian, and Kaloosdian) “shall be\n\nperpetual.” By-Laws § 2.4. Each donor that elected an initial trustee (CFF, Mathevosian,\n\nHovnanian, and the Assembly) is entitled to appoint a successor trustee in the event that the\n\ninitial trustee is unable to serve for any reason. Id. Additional trustees may be elected to the\n\nBoard of Trustees by making a contribution of $5 million to AGM&M, provided that the Board\n\nof Trustees has accepted the contribution by an 80% affirmative vote and the donor has\n\nappointed a successor. Id. § 2.5. Each donor (including initial donors) is entitled to one vote on\n\nthe Board of Trustees for each $5 million contributed. Id. §§ 2.4-2.5.\n\n        The By-Laws prohibit AGM&M from engaging in any activities or conduct that would\n\nnot be permitted to a corporation exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code. See By-Laws § 3.3. Similarly, the By-Laws provide that “[n]o part of\n\nthe net earnings shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, the Trustees, officers or others\n\nexcept that the Trustees shall be authorized and empowered, if they so elect, to pay to Trustees,\n\nofficers or others reasonable compensation for service rendered and to make payments and\n\ndistribution in furtherance of the purposes set forth in these By-Laws.” Id.\n\n        Pursuant to § 4.1 of the By-Laws,\n\n        Unless otherwise prohibited by law or sections 4.3 and 4.4 of these By-Laws, the\n        Corporation shall indemnify any Trustee or officer of the Corporation, any former\n        Trustee or officer of the Corporation, or any person who may have served at its\n        request as a trustee, director or officer of another corporation or entity, whether for\n        profit or not for profit, and may, by resolution of the Board of Trustees, indemnify\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       any employee or agent of the Corporation against any and all expenses and liabilities\n       actually and necessarily incurred by him or her or imposed on him or her in\n       connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether actual or threatened,\n       civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including appeals) in which he or she\n       is or may be made a party by reason of having been such Trustee, officer, person,\n       employee or agent, subject to the limitation, however, that there shall be no\n       indemnification in relation to matters as to which he or she shall be adjudged in such\n       claim, action, suit or proceeding to be guilty of a criminal offense or liable to the\n       Corporation for damages arising out of his or her own negligence or misconduct in\n       the performance of a duty to the Corporation.\n\nThe By-Laws provide that indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, counsel fees and\n\nother costs. Section 4.3 of the By-Laws provides that if AGM&M is ever deemed a private\n\nfoundation within the meaning of Section 509 of the Internal Revenue Code, no indemnification\n\nshall be paid if such payment would constitute an act of self-dealing or a taxable expenditure as\n\ndefined in Sections 4941(d) or 4945(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively. Id. § 4.3.\n\n       5.      The Unanimous Written Consent Agreement\n\n       On October 30, 2003, each of the four initial trustees of AGM&M signed a document\n\ntitled Unanimous Written Consent in Lieu of the Organization Meeting of the Board of Trustees\n\nof AGM&M. See DX-1 (hereinafter, “UWC”). By unanimous written consent, the Board of\n\nTrustees adopted a series of resolutions. First, the actions of the incorporators were ratified and\n\nthe By-Laws were approved. Second, the initial donors (and their appointed trustees) were\n\nrecognized to be CFF (Cafesjian), Hirair Hovnanian (himself), Anoush Mathevosian (herself),\n\nand the Assembly (Kaloosdian). Cafesjian was appointed Chairman and President, Hovnanian\n\nwas appointed Vice Chairman, and John Waters was appointed Secretary and Treasurer.\n\n       Through the Unanimous Written Consent agreement, the AGM&M Board of Trustees\n\nauthorized the officers to pay all of the organizational expenses of the corporation. The actions\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fof the Chairman (Cafesjian) and the Secretary/Treasurer (Waters) in negotiating the purchase of\n\nthe Adjacent Properties were ratified and approved, and the Secretary/Treasurer was authorized\n\n“to enter into and execute any and all documents necessary to effect the purchase” of the\n\nAdjacent Properties and “to take such other action as deemed necessary or desired to effect such\n\ntransactions.” UWC at 3. The AGM&M Board also approved and ratified the negotiation of\n\ngrant agreements with donors and the Assembly, and the Secretary/Treasurer was authorized to\n\nnegotiate further grant agreements with donors. The Board also accepted from the Assembly its\n\npower to appoint trustees for the Armenian National Institute.\n\n       E.      Efforts to Develop An Armenian Genocide Museum Through AGM&M\n\n       The facts surrounding what happened after AGM&M was formally created were\n\nthoroughly discussed in the Court’s prior Memorandum Opinion and need not be repeated herein.\n\nThe AGM&M Board of Trustees was unable to reach consensus on the proper size and scope of\n\nthe project, and tensions between Cafesjian and Hovnanian increased over a series of\n\ndisagreements about the museum project and other policies of the Assembly. By 2006, relations\n\nbetween the parties had completely broken down, prompting Cafesjian to propose that AGM&M\n\nbe dissolved. Cafesjian ultimately resigned from the AGM&M Board of Trustees, designating\n\nWaters as his successor. After Cafesjian sued the Assembly for payment on the promissory note,\n\nthe other AGM&M Trustees voted to exclude Waters from participation on all matters relating to\n\nthe museum project. This resulted in a series of lawsuits filed by the parties fighting for control\n\nof AGM&M and alleging mismanagement of the corporation. The three other AGM&M trustees\n\nattempted to move forward with the project without Waters’s involvement, but they were unable\n\nto raise the funds necessary to implement a development plan. Accordingly, the museum was not\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fdeveloped by December 31, 2010, thus triggering the reversion clause in the Grant Agreement.\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A.      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding CFF’s Obligation to\n               Reimburse AGM&M for the Value of Properties that Revert Under the Grant\n               Agreement\n\n       The Court ruled in its prior Memorandum Opinion that the reversion clause in the Grant\n\nAgreement was valid and enforceable and that CFF and Cafesjian may exercise their rights under\n\nthat clause effective December 31, 2010. Cafesjian informed the Court that only CFF will\n\nexercise its rights under the reversion clause and that CFF will elect to have the properties\n\ntransferred in lieu of the grant funds. The Court indicated, however, that Plaintiffs had raised\n\nquestions about whether returning the properties to CFF violates the rule—stated in the\n\nAGM&M By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation—that no part of AGM&M’s net earnings shall\n\ninure to the benefit of any trustee. The Court asked the parties to address in further briefing\n\nwhether it would be inequitable to enforce the reversion clause without requiring CFF to\n\nreimburse AGM&M for any potential increased value over the amount of funds originally\n\ndonated by CFF or Cafesjian, and to address whether it was the original intent of the contracting\n\nparties that the reversion would be a nonprofit transaction. Through supplemental briefing, the\n\nparties have clarified their positions on these issues.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the reversion clause in the Grant Agreement, when read in context\n\nwith the other provisions of the Grant Agreement and the terms of the AGM&M By-Laws and\n\nArticles of Incorporation, should be construed as requiring that CFF not realize a profit from the\n\nreversion. Plaintiffs contend that CFF will profit from the reversion because the value of the\n\nproperties being transferred exceeds the value of the donation that CFF and Cafesjian made as\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fpart of the Grant Agreement. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that a reversion without some form of\n\nreimbursement would violate federal tax laws applicable to nonprofit organizations under\n\n§ 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Defendants, by contrast, claim that the language in the\n\nGrant Agreement is unambiguous and places no restrictions on the right of CFF to elect a\n\nreversion of the properties rather than the grant funds. They also dispute Plaintiffs’ claim that the\n\nreversion runs afoul of the tax laws. The Court shall address these arguments below.\n\n                1.      The Grant Agreement\n\n        Ultimately, the issue before the Court is a straightforward question of contract\n\ninterpretation: does the Grant Agreement require CFF to reimburse AGM&M for the extent to\n\nwhich the value of the properties to be transferred exceeds the value of the grant funds donated to\n\nacquire them?\n\n        The District of Columbia adheres to an “objective” law of contracts, meaning that “the\n\nwritten language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the\n\nparties [regardless] of the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract, unless the\n\nwritten language is not susceptible of a clear and definite undertaking, or unless there is fraud,\n\nduress, or mutual mistake.” Dyer v. Bilaal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354-55 (D.C. 2009) (citation omitted;\n\nbrackets in original). “If the court finds that the contract has more than one reasonable\n\ninterpretation and therefore is ambiguous, then the court–after admitting probative extrinsic\n\nevidence–must determine what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have\n\nthought the disputed language meant.” Tillery v.

In determining whether a contract is ambiguous, courts examine the\n\ndocument on its face and give the language its plain meaning. Tillery, 912 A.2d at 1176.\n\n        The first step in interpreting a contract is to determine “what a reasonable person in the\n\nposition of the parties would have thought the disputed language meant.” Steele Foundations,\n\n937 A.2d at 154 (quoting Dodek v. CF 16 Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1092 (D.C. 1988)). “The\n\nmeaning must be ascertained in light of all the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time\n\nthe contract was made,” and “[t]he writing must be interpreted as a whole, giving a reasonable,\n\nlawful, and effective meaning to all its terms.” 1010 Potomac Assocs. v. Grocery Mfrs. of Am.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205 (D.C. 1984) (internal citations omitted).\n\n        The language in the Grant Agreement is unambiguous: if the conditions triggering the\n\nreversion are met, “at the Grantor’s sole discretion, the Assembly shall return to the Grantor the\n\nGrant funds or transfer to the Grantor the Grant Property.” It is clear from this language that the\n\nGrantor (CFF and Cafesjian) may choose between a return of the funds donated and a transfer of\n\nthe properties. There is no language in the reversion clause or anywhere else in the Grant\n\nAgreement that restricts the Grantor’s right to receive the Grant Property. The Court presumes\n\nthat if the parties had intended to place any restrictions of the Grantor’s right to elect a transfer of\n\nthe Grant Property, they would have memorialized that intent in the Grant Agreement itself,\n\nparticularly in light of the fact that the Grant Agreement contains an integration clause. See\n\nLuther Williams, Jr., Inc. v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (D.C. 1967) (“[I]t has always been\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fpresumed that a written contract is the final repository of the agreement of the parties. . . . [A]n\n\nintegration clause merely strengthens this presumption.”) (internal citation omitted).\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the two options in the reversion clause, “when read together and with\n\nthe balance of the Grant Agreement, signify that the exercise of the reversion would be a\n\nnonprofit transaction.” See Pls.’ Br. Regarding Reimbursement at 3. However, that is not a\n\nnatural construction of the plain language of the Grant Agreement. All parties knew at the time\n\nthey entered into the agreement that the value of the Grant Property, which included the Bank\n\nBuilding and the Adjacent Properties, would be potentially much greater than the value of the\n\nGrant funds, which covered the purchase of the Adjacent Properties and only about half the cost\n\nof the Bank Building (the other half being covered by Anoush Mathevosian). Therefore, even at\n\nthe outset, the Grantor’s choice was not between two options that were equal in value. It is\n\nimplausible that the parties would have intended the options to be equal seven years later on the\n\nreversion date of December 31, 2010, for this would effectively eliminate the Grantor’s right to\n\nelect the most valuable remedy.\n\n       It is even more inconceivable that the parties would have intended for the transfer of the\n\nGrant Property to be a nonprofit transaction without specifying any provisions for determining\n\nthe value of the Grant Property at the time of transfer. Valuing property in the absence of an\n\narms-length market transaction is inherently uncertain, and the record at trial indicated that there\n\nwere widely varying appraisals of the properties depending on whether they would be used to\n\nbuild a museum or sold to a commercial developer, with no definite valuation. See Trial Tr.\n\n(11/16 PM) at 85-87; DX-513N. Any valuation offered by the parties at this time would be\n\nspeculative. Since the Court has determined that there are no “strings” attached to CFF’s use of\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fthe properties once transferred, how would the Court decide what method of valuation was\n\nappropriate to ensure that CFF did not realize a profit? Such uncertainty over how to implement\n\na “nonprofit” transfer is a significant reason to assume that this was not what the parties\n\nintended.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that their interpretation of the options as equal in value is supported by\n\nthe limiting phrase in the reversion clause: “to the degree any portion of the Grants has been\n\nfunded . . . .” They argue that this phrase must be read as limiting the Grantor’s right of\n\nreversion to the extent that the Grants have actually been funded, and they argue that Defendants’\n\nconstruction “would allow the grantors to take back the entire grant properties even if they had\n\nnot fulfilled their payment obligations under the pledge.” Pl.’s Br. Regarding Reimbursement at\n\n7. But Plaintiffs overlook the fact that under the Grant Agreement, the Grant funds had to be\n\nused to purchase the Grant Property, meaning that if Cafesjian and CFF had not fulfilled their\n\npledges, AGM&M would never have acquired all of the properties that now must be transferred.\n\nTherefore, there was never any risk that Cafesjian and CFF would receive a windfall, for\n\nexample, by paying for the acquisition of only one of the Adjacent Properties and then receiving\n\nall four of them under the reversion clause. Ultimately, the Court is not persuaded that the phrase\n\n“to the degree any portion of the Grants has been funded” places any restriction on the Grantor’s\n\nright to elect a transfer of the Grant Property, particularly where the record demonstrates that\n\nCafesjian and CFF have fulfilled their obligations under the Grant Agreement.6\n\n\n       6\n        The record at trial indicated that the Assembly, acting on behalf of AGM&M, refused to\ncash CFF’s check for its annual payment of $150,000 for the 1340 G Street property in 2007.\nThe Court found that although the payment was made a few days late, there was no reason that\nthe Assembly could not have cashed the check and credited CFF with the payment. Accordingly,\nthe Court finds that CFF and Cafesjian satisfied their obligation to make the annual payment in\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Plaintiffs also argue that the requirement in § 3.3 of the Grant Agreement that the Grant\n\nfunds be used “only for purposes described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code”\n\nsupports their position. By its own terms, this provision acts as a limitation only on the use of\n\nthe Grant funds; it says nothing about transferring the Grant Property. Even assuming that § 3.3\n\napplied to the transfer of the Grant Property, the general language in § 3.3 cannot be fairly read to\n\nimplicitly restrict the more specific language contained in the reversion clause. Therefore, the\n\nCourt finds that § 3.3 does not impose any reimbursement requirement on the transfer of the\n\nGrant Property.\n\n       Plaintiffs complain that without a reimbursement requirement, CFF will be allowed to\n\nretain the benefit of the appreciated value of the properties, Anoush Mathevosian’s $3.5 million\n\ndonation, and more than seven years of carrying costs, taxes, and insurance that were paid for the\n\nproperties, with the result being that AGM&M is stripped of nearly all its assets. Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the parties could not have intended such an inequitable result. But this was a foreseeable\n\nconsequence at the time the parties entered into the agreement. The reversion clause in the Grant\n\nAgreement was intended to create a meaningful incentive for the parties to substantially complete\n\nthe museum project by December 31, 2010. Since the parties failed to reach that milestone,\n\nPlaintiffs must live with the consequences of their bargained-for agreement. The Court cannot\n\nreform the plain terms of the Grant Agreement simply because Plaintiffs belatedly realized how\n\ndire those consequences would be.\n\n\n\n\n2007, and there was no other evidence at trial suggesting that CFF and Cafesjian did not perform\ntheir funding obligations under the Grant Agreement.\n\n                                                 26\n\f               2.      The AGM&M By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the Court should look beyond the four corners of the Grant\n\nAgreement to the AGM&M By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation in determining the meaning\n\nof the reversion clause. However, the Court has no occasion to search beyond the text of the\n\nGrant Agreement because the terms of the reversion clause are clear and unambiguous. See 1010\n\nPotomac Assocs., 485 A.2d at 205 (“Extrinsic evidence of the parties’ subjective intent may be\n\nresorted to only if the document is ambiguous.”). Although the Court may consider these\n\ndocuments as part of the circumstances surrounding the formation of the Grant Agreement, see\n\nid., the execution of these documents does not alter the Court’s interpretation of the Grant\n\nAgreement. Plaintiffs contend that the adoption of the AGM&M Articles of Incorporation and\n\nBy-Laws around the same time as the Grant Agreement and Transfer Agreement demonstrates\n\nthat the parties intended for the private inurement restrictions contained in the By-Laws and the\n\nArticles to apply to the Grant Agreement. Again, however, the specific and direct language in\n\nthe reversion clause is the best evidence of the parties’ intent. The Court is not persuaded that\n\nthe parties would have intended to restrict the Grantor’s reversion rights through more general\n\nlanguage contained in entirely separate documents. See Washington Automotive Co. v. 1828 L\n\nStreet Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 880 (D.C. 2006) (“[It is] a familiar principle of contract\n\ninterpretation[] that ‘specific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general\n\nlanguage.’”) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 203(c) (1981)). The lack of any\n\nexplicit restriction on the transfer in the Grant Agreement strongly suggests that the parties did\n\nnot intend to subject the transfer to any private inurement regulations.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not construe the reversion clause in a manner that\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fcould result in adverse tax consequences for AGM&M, suggesting that the parties would not\n\nhave intended such a result. However, there is no reason to assume that the parties expected\n\nAGM&M to survive if the reversion clause was exercised; to the contrary, it is reasonable to\n\nassume that the parties expected the reversion of either the Grant funds or the Grant Property to\n\nbe the death knell for the organization. The parties in this litigation created AGM&M for the\n\nexpress purpose of creating a museum and memorial devoted to the Armenian Genocide on the\n\nsite of the Bank Building and the Adjacent Properties. Without those properties, it is unclear\n\nhow AGM&M could be expected to fulfill its mission and survive as an organization. Therefore,\n\nthe Court is not persuaded that the parties intended to spare AGM&M from any adverse tax\n\nconsequences that might result from the transfer of the Grant Property.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that construing the reversion clause as requiring no reimbursement for\n\nappreciated value would create “a vehicle for tax fraud” because it would allow wealthy donors\n\nto put cash into a charity for the acquisition of real estate, wait for the value of that real estate to\n\nincrease over time, and then seek the return of the appreciated real estate pursuant to some unmet\n\ncondition, thereby gaining the appreciated property without any consequence. See Pls.’ Br.\n\nRegarding Reimbursement at 7. It is unclear why Plaintiffs believe there would be no tax\n\nconsequences to the donor in this hypothetical, and Plaintiffs cite no authority to explain their\n\ntheory of this “vehicle for tax fraud.” In any event, the collection and recovery of federal taxes is\n\nthe sole responsibility of the United States government; Plaintiffs cannot compel Defendants to\n\ncomply with the tax code through this litigation. See 26 U.S.C. § 7401 (“No civil action for the\n\ncollection or recovery of taxes, or of any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, shall be commenced unless\n\nthe Secretary [of the Treasury] authorizes or sanctions the proceedings and the Attorney General\n\n\n                                                   28\n\for his delegate directs that the action be commenced.”). Furthermore, the Court has no power to\n\nchange the terms of the Grant Agreement merely because enforcing the reversion clause can be\n\nexpected to have adverse tax consequences for the parties.\n\n               3.      Tax Regulations Prohibiting Private Benefit\n\n       Plaintiffs have presented the Court with a rather complicated set of arguments as to why\n\nthey believe that allowing CFF to profit from the transfer of the Grant Property will violate\n\nfederal tax laws pertaining to tax-exempt organizations. As the Court has explained, these\n\narguments are essentially irrelevant because the Grant Agreement clearly and unambiguously\n\nrequires AGM&M to transfer the properties without regard to the tax consequences of the\n\ntransfer. In any event, the Court is not persuaded that the transfer of the properties to CFF\n\nviolates the tax laws as Plaintiffs claim.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ central argument is that by transferring the Grant Property to CFF, AGM&M\n\nwill be violating regulations that require § 501(c)(3) organizations to be operated exclusively for\n\ntax-exempt purposes. Pursuant to 26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(2), “[a]n organization is not\n\noperated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes if its net earnings inure in whole or in part\n\nto the benefit of private shareholders or individuals.” A private shareholder or individual is\n\ndefined as a person having a personal and private interest in the activities of the organization. 26\n\nC.F.R. § 1.501(a)-1(c). The purpose of the inurement provision is “to prevent the siphoning of\n\ncharitable receipts to insiders of the charity.” United Cancer Council, Inc. v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760907\"><a href=\"/opinion/760907/united-cancer-council-inc-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176 (7th Cir. 1999); see also I.R.S. Priv. Ltr. Rul. 201047033 (Nov. 3, 2010) (“Inurement\n\nis any transfer of charitable assets to the organization’s insiders for which the organization does\n\nnot receive adequate consideration. Inurement can take many forms.”).\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f       Defendants argue that there can be no violation of the inurement provision because the\n\nproperty is being transferred to CFF, another 501(c)(3) organization which is neither a\n\nshareholder of AGM&M nor a private individual. Because CFF itself must operate exclusively\n\nfor tax-exempt purposes, Defendants argue that there will be no “private” benefit from the\n\ntransfer of property that would frustrate the purposes of § 501(c)(3). Plaintiffs do not directly\n\nrespond to this argument in their briefing, and they have cited no cases in which it was\n\ndetermined that a 501(c)(3) organization was a private shareholder or individual for purposes of\n\nthe inurement provision. In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel essentially conceded the point during a\n\nStatus Hearing on February 24, 2011, noting that “by designating the actual acquiring entity as\n\nCFF, that . . . avoids some of the limitations in the private inurement law.” 2/24/11 Hr’g Tr. at\n\n16. Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that the transfer of the properties to CFF will\n\nviolate the prohibition on private inurement as stated in the federal tax laws and incorporated into\n\nthe By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation of AGM&M.7\n\n       Moreover, based on a review of the substance of the transaction as a whole, the Court is\n\nnot persuaded that the transfer of the property under the Grant Agreement qualifies as private\n\ninurement. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ characterization, this is not a case where a wealthy donor gave\n\nmoney to an organization to buy property and then the corporation gave the property back to the\n\ndonor after it had substantially appreciated. This is a case where a donor made a conditional gift\n\nof funds to be used for a specific purpose, and after AGM&M was unable to fulfill the required\n\n\n\n       7\n         Plaintiffs suggested during the February 24, 2011 Status Hearing that because the Grant\nAgreement defines the “Grantor” as Cafesjian and CFF, there must be a private benefit to\nCafesjian. However, Cafesjian has relinquished his right to receive the property in favor of CFF,\nand Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how Cafesjian will benefit from the transfer.\n\n                                                 30\n\fconditions, it was compelled to allow the donor to recover the properties acquired with the gifted\n\nfunds. Defendants rely heavily on Underwood v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2266593\"><a href=\"/opinion/2266593/underwood-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1382</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Tex.\n\n1978), which also involved the return of a conditional gift. In Underwood, the plaintiff had\n\nagreed to donate $1 million to the Southern Methodist University School of Law through a\n\ncharitable foundation with the understanding that all of his donations would be deductible for\n\nfederal income tax purposes. See id. at 1384. After the IRS disallowed some of Underwood’s\n\ndeductions to the charitable foundation, Underwood reached an agreement with the foundation to\n\nreturn his donations so that he could give the money directly to the law school. Id. at 1385. The\n\nIRS determined that the return of funds from the foundation amounted to self-dealing in violation\n\nof 26 U.S.C. § 4941, which imposes a tax on any act of self-dealing between a private foundation\n\nand any “disqualified person” such as a substantial contributor to the foundation. See 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4941, 4946(a)(1).8 However, the Underwood court held that the return of funds by the\n\nfoundation was not an act of self-dealing because it was simply the return of a conditional gift.\n\n461 F. Supp. at 1389.\n\n       Underwood is distinguishable from this case, primarily because the donor in that case\n\nreceived an exact refund of the amount he had donated. By contrast, CFF is going to receive\n\nproperties that were purchased for $3.5 million more than CFF and Cafesjian donated to acquire\n\nthem (the amount of Mathevosian’s contribution) and that may or may not have appreciated in\n\nvalue since then. Therefore, it could be argued that CFF will “profit” from the transfer of the\n\n\n       8\n          Plaintiffs argue that AGM&M is now a private foundation and therefore may be subject\nto this tax if it transfers the Grant Property to CFF. As explained below, the Court does not\nbelieve that the transfer can be characterized as an act of self-dealing within the meaning of\n§ 4941. Furthermore, Plaintiffs assume without discussion that CFF falls within the definition of\n“disqualified person” under the statute, but this is not clear.\n\n                                                31\n\fproperties. However, pecuniary gain does not automatically equate to inurement; the question is\n\nwhether the profit is reasonable in light of the benefits to AGM&M. Cf. Church By Mail, Inc. v.\n\nComm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454519\"><a href=\"/opinion/454519/church-by-mail-inc-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1392-93 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that payment of excessive salaries to\n\nemployees may constitute inurement to the benefit of a private person). The circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Grant Agreement and the formation of AGM&M demonstrate that the reversion\n\nclause was an essential part of the bargain that enabled AGM&M to obtain the funds necessary to\n\nacquire the properties. Cafesjian and CFF were unwilling to donate additional millions of dollars\n\nto the genocide museum and memorial project unless they could be reasonably assured that the\n\nproject would be substantially completed in a timely manner. Therefore, they demanded a\n\nreversion clause that would enable them to get control of the properties in case AGM&M was\n\nunsuccessful. This was not a sham transaction for AGM&M to shelter assets for Cafesjian and\n\nCFF; it was an agreement that gave AGM&M a financial incentive to be successful with the\n\nmoney donated by Cafesjian and CFF. The Court has already found that Cafesjian and the CFF-\n\ndesignated trustees of AGM&M acted in good faith to try to develop the genocide museum and\n\nmemorial before the reversion date of December 31, 2010. In that regard, it is unfair and without\n\nsupport to characterize the Grant Agreement as an act of self-dealing or to state that AGM&M\n\nwas operating for the private benefit of Cafesjian or CFF.9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         Plaintiffs erroneously claim that Cafesjian was entitled to four votes on the AGM&M\nBoard of Trustees by virtue of his pledge of more than $15 million. See Pls.’ Reimbursement Br.\nat 14. At most, Cafesjian would have been entitled to three votes under the AGM&M By-Laws.\nHowever, because of the 80% vote requirement, Cafesjian would have had veto power over the\nBoard’s decisions even if he were only recognized as having one vote. In any event, the Court\nhas already rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that Cafesjian acted in bad faith through his\nmanagement of AGM&M.\n\n                                                32\n\f               4.      Implementing the Transfer\n\n       For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that the Grant Agreement clearly\n\nand unambiguously requires AGM&M to transfer the Grant Property to CFF without regard to\n\nany tax consequences that flow therefrom. To date, AGM&M has failed to transfer the Grant\n\nProperty, citing concerns about the tax consequences of the transfer and demanding that several\n\nrestrictions be placed on the transfer.10 Now that the Court has addressed Plaintiffs’ arguments\n\nrelating to the tax consequences of the transfer, there should be no reason for further delaying the\n\ntransfer of the properties. Defendants have asked the Court to order the trustees of AGM&M to\n\nsign certain documents prepared by Defendants to complete the transfer. The Court declines at\n\nthis time to order the trustees to sign the specific documents drafted by Defendants’ counsel.\n\nInstead, the Court shall order the AGM&M trustees to transfer the property to CFF in accordance\n\nwith D.C. law by no later than May 23, 2011.\n\n       B.      Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding AGM&M’s Indemnification\n               of Cafesjian and Waters\n\n       The Court ruled in its prior Memorandum Opinion that Defendants Cafesjian and Waters\n\nwere entitled to indemnification under § 4.1 of the AGM&M By-Laws for expenses actually and\n\nnecessarily incurred by them in defense of claims brought against them by Plaintiffs. The\n\nindemnification requirement extends only to claims that arose out of Cafesjian’s or Waters’s\n\nduties as officers or directors of AGM&M, which are asserted in Count One of the Consolidated\n\nComplaint. Expenses relating to the Assembly’s claims against Cafesjian and Waters for breach\n\n\n       10\n          Among the conditions that the AGM&M trustees seek to impose is an agreement that\nCFF will forfeit the Grant Property to the Assembly if a permanent museum and memorial\ndevoted to the Armenian Genocide is not constructed within five years. See [212] Pls.’ Status\nReport at 4.\n\n                                                33\n\fof fiduciary duty or misappropriation of trade secrets are not covered by the indemnification\n\nclause in the AGM&M By-Laws. The Court previously indicated that it would determine the\n\namount of indemnification in post-trial proceedings. Cafesjian and Waters have submitted a\n\nbrief with supporting documentation that sets forth the amount of their expenses. Plaintiffs have\n\nfiled an opposition contesting the reasonableness and validity of those expenses, and Defendants\n\nhave filed a reply. Plaintiffs raise a series of objections to Defendants’ request for\n\nindemnification, and the Court shall address each below.\n\n       “[O]nce a contractual entitlement to attorney’s fees has been ascertained, the\n\ndetermination of a reasonable fee award is for the trial court in light of the relevant\n\ncircumstances.” Ideal Electronic Sec. Co. v. Int’l Fid. Ins.

Self-Dealing\n\n       Although they did not raise this argument before the Court issued its Memorandum\n\nOpinion, Plaintiffs now contend that indemnification is not required under the By-Laws because\n\nAGM&M has been deemed a private foundation within the meaning of § 509 of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code and the payment of legal expenses to Cafesjian and Waters would amount to an\n\nact of self-dealing under § 4941(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. See By-Laws § 4.3 (“[I]f at\n\nany time the Corporation is deemed to be a private foundation within the meaning of Section 509\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fof the Code then, during such time, no payment shall be made under this Article if such payment\n\nwould constitute an act of self-dealing or a taxable expenditure, as defined in Section 4941(d) or\n\nSection 4945(d), respectively, of the Code.”). Defendants dispute whether AGM&M has been\n\n“deemed to be a private foundation,” since there is no evidence that the IRS has yet made such a\n\ndetermination. Plaintiffs have submitted financial documents to the Court under seal purportedly\n\nshowing that AGM&M lost its status as a public charity in fiscal year 2010, when its public\n\nsupport fraction dropped below the level required to maintain public charity status. See [217]\n\nPls.’ Status Report to the Court at 3-5. However, there is no evidence before the Court indicating\n\nthat the IRS has made any determination that AGM&M qualifies as a private foundation.\n\nSection 4.3 provides that indemnification shall not be paid “during such time” that “the\n\nCorporation is deemed to be private foundation,” suggesting that until a determination is made by\n\nthe IRS, indemnification must be paid.\n\n       Even assuming that AGM&M is deemed a private foundation, however, Treasury\n\nregulations provide that indemnification of former officers does not amount to an act of self-\n\ndealing for purposes of § 4941(d). Pursuant to 26 C.F.R. § 53.4941(d)-2(f)(3),\n\n       section 4941(d)(1) shall not apply to the indemnification by a private foundation of\n       a foundation manager, with respect to the manager’s defense in any civil judicial or\n       civil administrative proceeding arising out of the manager’s performance of services\n       (or failure to perform services) on behalf of the foundation, against all expenses\n       (other than taxes, including taxes imposed by chapter 42, penalties, or expenses of\n       correction) including attorneys’ fees, judgments and settlement expenditures if—\n               (A) Such expenses are reasonably incurred by the manager in connection with\n               such proceeding; and\n               (B) The manager has not acted willfully and without reasonable cause with\n               respect to the act or failure to act which led to such proceeding or to liability\n               for tax under chapter 42.\n\nTherefore, the By-Laws provision precluding payment of indemnification where it constitutes\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fself-dealing does not preclude the Court from ordering AGM&M to pay Cafesjian and Waters for\n\nthe reasonable expenses they incurred in defending their claims.\n\n               2.      Arbitration\n\n       Plaintiffs next argue that the Court should reject Defendants’ request for indemnification\n\nbecause the legal expenses associated with this litigation could have been avoided had Cafesjian\n\nand Waters agreed to arbitrate this dispute. Plaintiffs had filed a demand for arbitration with the\n\nAmerican Arbitration Association on September 13, 2007 relating to the first lawsuit filed by\n\nCafesjian and CFF against the Assembly in Minnesota. On October 10, 2007, Cafesjian and\n\nWaters, inter alia, filed a lawsuit in Minnesota to enjoin the arbitration. The parties ultimately\n\nstipulated to the dismissal of that lawsuit in September 2007. Therefore, Plaintiffs have long\n\nsince abandoned any attempt to compel arbitration of the issues contested in these actions, and\n\nthere is nothing in the arbitration provisions of the AGM&M By-Laws that requires Cafesjian\n\nand Waters to agree to arbitration. Most significantly, the indemnification provision in the\n\nAGM&M By-Laws does not require Cafesjian or Waters to submit to arbitration. Accordingly,\n\nthere is no basis for concluding that Cafesjian’s and Waters’s legal expenses are unreasonable or\n\nunnecessary based on their decision to litigate in federal court. The Court also notes that\n\nPlaintiffs did not include this argument in their proposed conclusions of law or otherwise present\n\nthis argument to the Court during the trial; this is an independent reason for rejecting Plaintiffs’\n\nargument.\n\n               3.      Expenses Incurred by CFF\n\n       Plaintiffs next claim that CFF has paid the legal expenses for this litigation on behalf of\n\nCafesjian and Waters, and since CFF is not subject to indemnification under the AGM&M By-\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fLaws, they claim that no indemnification is owed. In response to Plaintiffs’ claim, Defendants\n\nstate that they have removed any expenses paid by CFF from their request for indemnification,\n\nleaving only expenses paid by Cafesjian.11 Defendants have produced a declaration with\n\nsupporting documentation demonstrating that Cafesjian personally paid for the legal expenses\n\nthat were not covered by CFF. See Defs.’ Reply in Support of Br. Quantifying Attorneys’ Fees\n\nfor Indemnification, Ex. E (Suppl. Decl. of William G. Laxton, Jr.). Accordingly, the Court shall\n\nconsider only these expenses that were incurred by Cafesjian in determining the amount of\n\nindemnification required under the AGM&M By-Laws.\n\n               4.      Identification of Expenses Subject to Indemnification\n\n       Because the scope of indemnification under the AGM&M By-Laws is limited to the\n\nexpenses incurred by Cafesjian and Waters in defending the claims asserted against them as\n\nformer officers and trustees of AGM&M, Defendants must identify which expenses are related to\n\nthese claims and separate any expenses that they incurred asserting counterclaims against\n\nPlaintiffs or defending against separate claims asserted by the Assembly. In order to accomplish\n\nthis task, Defendants have identified three categories of expenses: (1) those that are clearly\n\nrelated to the defense of claims asserted against Waters and Cafesjian in their capacities as\n\nfiduciaries of AGM&M; (2) those that are clearly related to other claims asserted in the litigation;\n\nand (3) those expenses that cannot easily be separated between these two categories of claims\n\n(“blended expenses”). Defendants seek indemnity for the amount of expenses in the first\n\ncategory and 67% of the blended expenses, based on Defendants’ estimate of the proportion of\n\n\n\n       11\n        Waters testified at trial that he had not paid for any legal expenses. See Trial Tr. (11/15\nAM) at 36-37.\n\n                                                 37\n\fthose expenses that can be fairly attributed to the defense of claims that are subject to\n\nindemnification. Plaintiffs do not take issue with Defendants’ decisions about which expenses\n\nbelong in each category. However, Plaintiffs argue that none of the blended expenses should be\n\nawarded because they cannot clearly be linked to the claims that must be indemnified.\n\nAlternatively, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ proposed percentage is too high and should be\n\ngreatly reduced to 19%.\n\n       The parties have cited only a few cases to support their arguments regarding the proper\n\nallocation of attorneys’ fees, all of which involve application of a fee-shifting statute rather than a\n\ncontractual indemnification clause.

Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), the Supreme\n\nCourt addressed how fees should be awarded to a prevailing party where the party prevailed on\n\nonly some of the claims asserted in the litigation. The Court noted that in such cases, “[m]uch of\n\ncounsel’s time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide\n\nthe hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis,” and therefore courts “should focus on the\n\nsignificance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably\n\nexpended on the litigation.” 461 U.S. at 435; accord Thomas v. Nat’l Football League Players\n\nAss’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185560\"><a href=\"/opinion/185560/thomas-valerie-v-natl-ftbl-leag-plyrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The most analogous case cited by the parties is\n\nAlpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralson Purina Co., No. Civ. A. 86-2728, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1292963</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. Dec.\n\n4, 1991), in which the court awarded attorneys’ fees that were limited to the costs of prosecuting\n\nsuccessful aspects of the prevailing party’s case-in-chief. See id. at *12-13. In that case, the\n\nparty seeking an award undertook a three-step methodology to calculate the time attributable to\n\nits successful counterclaim: first, it excluded time clearly unrelated to the successful claim; then,\n\nit segregated the remaining legal fees into various subject matter categories based on the nature\n\n\n                                                  38\n\fof the relationship to the successful claim; and finally it estimated the percentage of time in each\n\ncategory that could fairly be attributed to a successful result. Id. at *12. The court accepted this\n\nmethodology as a valid means of proving the amount of fees that should be awarded. Id.\n\n       These cases are somewhat in tension with the D.C. Court of Appeals’s decision in\n\nSafeway Stores, Inc. v. Chamberlain Protective Services, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. 1982). In that\n\ncase, the court affirmed the denial of attorneys’ fees and expenses to a party where the court\n\ndetermined that it was impossible to allocate the fees and expenses among three claims, only one\n\nof which was subject to indemnity. Id. at 72-73. However, in that case, the party’s right to\n\nindemnification was based on the limited exception to the American Rule that allows a party\n\nwrongfully involved in litigation with a third party to recover the expenses of such litigation from\n\nthe wrongdoer. See id. at 68-69. It is therefore unclear whether Safeway Stores controls beyond\n\nits core holding that “an indemnitee may be denied recovery of attorney’s fees from his\n\ncodefendant indemnitor where the fees incurred in establishing his right to indemnity are\n\nconsidered inseparable from those incurred in defending the alleged negligence.” Id. at 73.\n\n       The Court finds that it is unnecessary to resolve this issue at this time because Defendants\n\nmay be able to break down many of their “blended” expenses in a manner that more clearly\n\nidentifies whether the costs incurred or the work performed were actually related to the claims\n\nsubject to indemnification. Moreover, beyond criticizing Defendants’ approach to calculating a\n\npercentage for the blended expenses, Plaintiffs also contend that many of the expenses claimed\n\nby Defendants are unreasonable. Plaintiffs complain that Defendants’ legal bills are bloated by\n\nexcessive time devoted to ordinary tasks, appearances by multiple attorneys where only one was\n\nnecessary, and other unnecessary expenses. In order to expedite resolution of these disputes over\n\n\n                                                 39\n\fthe necessity of particular expenses, the Court shall refer this issue to a magistrate judge for a\n\nreport and recommendation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b) and Local Civil\n\nRule 72.3(a). The magistrate judge may review Defendants’ categorization of “blended”\n\nexpenses and determine whether there is a more appropriate methodology for separating which\n\nexpenses should be indemnified and which should not. The magistrate judge may also review\n\nPlaintiffs’ objections to particular expenses and make decisions about which expenses were\n\n“actually and necessarily incurred” within the meaning of the indemnification provision of the\n\nAGM&M By-Laws. Upon review of the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, the\n\nCourt shall determine, if necessary, whether Defendants’ proposed blended expenses approach is\n\nappropriate and what percentage should be applied to those expenses.\n\n       C.       Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation\n\n       Apart from their claim for indemnification, Defendants have filed a [221] Motion\n\nRequesting Attorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation. Defendants argue that the Court should\n\naward attorneys’ fees under its inherent authority to sanction parties for vexatious conduct or,\n\nalternatively, under 28 U.S.C. § 1927, which provides that “[a]ny attorney or other person . . .\n\nwho so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required to\n\nsatisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred because of\n\nsuch conduct.” Defendants contend that they should be awarded attorneys’ fees based on: (1)\n\nPlaintiffs’ pursuit of a claim for equitable disgorgement of Cafesjian’s investments in Armenia\n\nthat was ultimately withdrawn before trial; (2) Plaintiffs’ refusal to disclose its theories of\n\ndamages during discovery; (3) Plaintiffs’ use of allegedly obstructive tactics during discovery;\n\n(4) Plaintiffs’ filing unnecessary motions in the course of the litigation; and (5) Plaintiffs’ failure\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fto produce a substantial number of documents until the eve of trial. Plaintiffs have filed an\n\nopposition to Defendants’ motion, and Plaintiffs’ trial counsel, K&L Gates LLP, have intervened\n\nfor the purpose of filing an opposition to Defendants’ motion. Defendants have responded to\n\nboth of these oppositions, and the motion is now ripe for adjudication.\n\n       Although the American Rule generally provides that each party must bears its own legal\n\ncosts, the federal courts have inherent power to assess attorneys’ fees when a party has “acted in\n\nbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” Chambers v.

Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583856\"><a href=\"/opinion/583856/united-states-v-melvin-d-wallace-and-arthur-m-levin/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1218 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Before imposing sanctions on an attorney, the Court must evaluate\n\nwhether the attorney’s conduct was “at least reckless[.]” Id. at 1217. Recklessness is a “high\n\nthreshold . . . and in general requires deliberate action in the face of a known risk, the likelihood\n\nor impact of which the actor inexcusably ignores.” Id. at 1219-20. “The power to assess costs on\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fthe attorney involved is a power which the courts should exercise only in instances of serious and\n\nstudied disregard for the orderly process of justice.” Id. at 1220 (quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted). “[U]nintended, inadvertent, and negligent acts will not support an imposition of\n\nsanctions under section 1927.” Id. at 1219 (quoting Cruz v.

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide a\n\nmechanism for awarding expenses to parties who incur expenses as a result of unnecessary\n\ndiscovery, and that is the preferred approach for awarding expenses as a result of misconduct\n\nduring discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(3) & 37(a)(5). Defendants did not seek expenses\n\nduring the course of discovery, and Defendants do not rely on the Federal Rules in asking the\n\nCourt to award fees for vexatious litigation.\n\n                 1.      Plaintiffs’ Pursuit of a Claim for Disgorgement of Cafesjian’s Investments\n\n          Defendants argue that they should be awarded the fees they incurred in defending a claim\n\nasserted by the Assembly for disgorgement of Cafesjian’s business interests based on his failure\n\nto disclose those interests to the Assembly under its conflicts of interest policy. The Assembly\n\ndid not explicitly assert such a claim in its original complaint in Civil Action No. 08-255.\n\nHowever, the Assembly did pursue discovery based on a disgorgement theory of damages in\n\nconnection with its claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the conflicts of interest\n\npolicy. Defendants refused to respond to the Assembly’s requests for discovery on relevancy\n\ngrounds, and the Court denied the Assembly’s motion to compel this discovery. The Assembly\n\n\n                                                   42\n\fultimately dropped this claim prior to trial. Defendants complain that they were forced to\n\ninvestigate the Assembly’s disgorgement theory and devote resources to defeating it during the\n\ncourse of the litigation. Defendants essentially argue that the disgorgement claim was frivolous\n\nand that Plaintiffs were asserting it for the improper purpose of harassing Cafesjian with\n\nimproper discovery requests.\n\n       Although the legal basis for the Assembly’s disgorgement claim has never been clear to\n\nthe Court and the claim was ultimately dropped as lacking merit, the Court is not persuaded that\n\nPlaintiffs’ pursuit of that theory demonstrates recklessness or bad faith. It is often the case that\n\nthe contours of a party’s claims evolve throughout the discovery process, particularly with\n\nrespect to damages and remedies. The fact that Plaintiffs propounded overbroad discovery\n\nrequests related to this claim does not warrant imposition of sanctions for vexatious litigation,\n\neven though it may have been sufficient to justify an award of expenses under Rule 26(c) if\n\nDefendants had moved for a protective order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(3) & 37(a)(5) (providing\n\nthat expenses may be awarded if a motion for protective order is granted). The fact that\n\nDefendants did not move for discovery sanctions suggests that Plaintiffs’ efforts to pursue their\n\ndisgorgement claim were not more vexatious than their pursuit of other claims that were\n\nultimately found to be meritless. In fact, the record shows that Plaintiffs’ attempts to litigate a\n\ndisgorgement claim were limited to identifying disgorgement as a potential remedy in their\n\nanswers to interrogatories, requesting discovery relating to Cafesjian’s business interests (which\n\nthe Court denied), and asserting this argument during the deposition of Edele Hovnanian. While\n\nDefendants complain that they were forced to conduct legal research to determine the viability of\n\nPlaintiffs’ theory, that is part of the ordinary costs of civil litigation. Accordingly, the Court\n\n\n                                                  43\n\fdeclines to exercise its discretion to award legal expenses to Defendants based on Plaintiffs’\n\nattempts to pursue a disgorgement claim.\n\n               2.      Plaintiffs’ Failure to Disclose Theories of Damages During Discovery\n\n       Defendants contend that they should be awarded expenses as a result of Plaintiffs’ failure\n\nto disclose various theories of damages during discovery. The Court previously granted\n\nDefendants’ motion to strike any theories of damages that were not sufficiently disclosed during\n\ndiscovery. See Pretrial Conference Mem. Op. & Order (Oct. 22, 2010) at 13-27. However,\n\nDefendants ask for the additional sanction of attorneys’ fees, arguing that Plaintiffs vexatiously\n\navoided their obligations to disclose their theories of damages. Defendants rely on the fact that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to provide a computation of their damages at the outset of discovery as required\n\nby Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii), instructed Dr. Rouben Adalian not to answer questions relating to\n\ndamages during his deposition, and provided incomplete or vague responses to Defendants’\n\ninterrogatories about damages. Defendants also rely on the fact that Plaintiffs’ Rule 30(b)(6)\n\nwitness, Van Krikorian, was unable to answer questions relating to the calculation of damages\n\nduring his deposition. Krikorian testified during that deposition that Plaintiffs would produce an\n\nexpert witness to address the subject of damages, but Plaintiffs never designated any expert\n\nwitnesses.\n\n       It is clear from the record that Plaintiffs were less than forthcoming about their theories of\n\ndamages during discovery, and that is the basis upon which the Court granted Defendants’\n\nmotion to strike those claims. However, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs’ conduct\n\namounts to recklessness or bad faith sufficient to justify a sanction under § 1927 or the Court’s\n\ninherent authority. The record indicates that Plaintiffs did supplement their disclosures with\n\n\n                                                44\n\festimates of their damages, and it appears that they may have had a good faith basis for asserting\n\nthose claims at the time. Ultimately, Plaintiffs were unable to come up with evidence in support\n\nof those claims, and therefore they were unable to give satisfactory responses to Defendants’\n\ndiscovery demands. The Court is not convinced that Plaintiffs were acting vexatiously by\n\nasserting their damages claims during discovery and then being caught without evidence to\n\nsupport them. Therefore, the Court finds that its pretrial sanction precluding Plaintiffs from\n\nproceeding based on undisclosed damages was sufficient, and it declines to award attorneys’ fees\n\nbased on this conduct.\n\n               3.        Plaintiffs’ Alleged Gamesmanship During Discovery\n\n       Defendants next argue that they should be awarded fees as a result of what they call\n\n“unnecessary discovery and obstructive tactics” by Plaintiffs relating to two depositions taken\n\nduring discovery. First, Defendants complain about the fact that Plaintiffs’ counsel instructed\n\nAdalian not to answer questions about damages during his deposition, since this was not a proper\n\ninstruction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2) (“A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only\n\nwhen necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present\n\na motion under Rule 30(d)(3).”) Second, Defendants complain about the fact that two days prior\n\nto Anoush Mathevosian’s scheduled deposition, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a\n\nprotective order to proceed with the deposition by written questions in lieu of an oral\n\nexamination pursuant to Rule 31. Although Plaintiffs based their motion on Mathevosian’s poor\n\nhealth, Defendants argue that it was made for purely strategic reasons because Plaintiffs needed\n\nadditional time to prepare Mathevosian to testify regarding the May 7, 2007 meeting of the\n\nAGM&M Board of Trustees.\n\n\n                                                45\n\f       With respect to deposition of Adalian, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel\n\nhis testimony on the subject of damages. See [59] Order (May 7, 2009). Plaintiffs’ counsel had\n\ninstructed Adalian not to answer questions about damages because a Rule 30(b)(6) witness was\n\nbeing designated for that purpose. During a telephone conference on the record with the Court,\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel agreed that this was an inappropriate basis upon which to instruct Adalian not\n\nto answer questions. Accordingly, the Court ordered that Dr. Adalian’s deposition be continued\n\nso that Defendants could ask him questions relating to damages. Defendants did not request any\n\nsanctions at the time, and the Court did not award any sanctions.\n\n       With respect to the deposition of Mathevosian, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ emergency\n\nmotion to proceed upon written questions rather than by oral examination. See [64] Order (June\n\n23, 2009). The Court held that Defendants had established that it was important to depose her\n\nand that Plaintiffs had not substantiated their claims that she was too ill to be deposed.\n\nDefendants ultimately deposed Mathevosian at her home, and the videotape of that deposition\n\nwas presented to the Court as part of the record at trial. It is apparent from that video that she\n\nwas in poor health, and given the limited scope of the questioning from Defendants during that\n\ndeposition, it was reasonable for Plaintiffs to ask the Court to limit the method of questioning.\n\n       Defendants have seized upon these two incidents during discovery as evidence of\n\nPlaintiffs’ vexatiousness. However, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs’ counsel acted\n\nrecklessly or in bad faith in taking these actions. Accordingly, the Court declines to award a\n\nsanction of attorneys’ fees based on this conduct.\n\n               4.      Unnecessary Motions Practice\n\n       Defendants next argue that they should be awarded expenses because Plaintiffs filed\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fseveral unnecessary “motions” during the course of the litigation. First, Defendants complain\n\nabout a request for entry of default that was filed 35 days after Defendants failed to file an answer\n\nto Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint in Civil Action No. 07-1259. The Court denied\n\nPlaintiffs’ request for entry of default, agreeing with Defendants that default was inappropriate in\n\nlight of their participation in the lawsuit and the related actions pending before the Court.\n\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs filed their request only for the purpose of delay and harassment,\n\nbut they concede that Plaintiffs’ action was allowed by Rule 55. The Court declines to sanction\n\nPlaintiffs for taking an action that is explicitly authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.\n\n       Defendants next complain about Plaintiffs’ reference to Rule 11 in a footnote of their\n\nreply brief in support of summary judgment. See [79] Pls.’ Reply Mem. at 5 n.5. In that\n\nfootnote, Plaintiffs suggested that Defendants had improperly cited Delaware case law and\n\nsecondary sources in support of their breach of fiduciary duty claims. With leave of the Court,\n\nDefendants filed a surreply to respond to Plaintiffs’ suggestion. See [82] Defs.’ Surreply. The\n\nCourt agrees with Defendants that the reference to Rule 11 was unnecessary, but Defendants also\n\ndid not need to file a surreply to respond to Plaintiffs’ footnote.12 The Court shall not sanction\n\nPlaintiffs for asserting a legal argument that Defendants’ cited sources are not controlling\n\nauthority.\n\n       Finally, Defendants complain about a motion filed by Plaintiffs on the eve of trial asking\n\n\n\n       12\n         Plaintiffs did not file a motion for sanctions under Rule 11, and the Court did not\nconstrue Plaintiffs’ footnote as requesting that sanctions be imposed. In any event, it was\nobvious to the Court that Defendants’ citation of persuasive authority was not sanctionable\nconduct.\n\n                                                 47\n\fDefendants to certify that they had complied with certain discovery obligations. See [152] Pls.’\n\nMot. for Order Requiring Defs.’ Confirmation of Compliance with Discovery Obligations.\n\nPlaintiffs were seeking confirmation that Defendants had searched all of Cafesjian’s email\n\naddresses for discoverable information in light of new evidence of additional email accounts that\n\nsurfaced before trial. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ motion was unnecessary and vexatious\n\nbecause the parties were engaged in discussion about producing any outstanding materials before\n\ntrial. The Court ultimately denied the motion without prejudice after the parties appeared to have\n\nresolved the dispute through negotiation. While Plaintiffs should have been able to resolve their\n\ndisagreement with Defendants before filing a motion with the Court, the Court does not find that\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion was vexatious. The parties had legitimate disputes about last-minute discovery\n\nobligations, and Plaintiffs’ decision to file a motion with the Court was not clearly inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the Court shall not sanction Plaintiffs based on this conduct.\n\n               5.      Production of Documents on the Eve of Trial\n\n       Defendants’ final request for attorneys’ fees is based on the fact that Plaintiffs produced a\n\nlarge number of documents—some 12,000 pages of emails—less than two weeks before the start\n\nof the trial. Plaintiffs’ late production is troubling because these emails—many of which were\n\nultimately used by Defendants as important exhibits at trial—should have been produced prior to\n\nthe close of discovery pursuant to the Court’s scheduling order and prior rulings relating to the\n\nconsolidated discovery in these actions. By producing these documents on the eve of trial,\n\nPlaintiffs forced Defendants to spend a significant amount of time and resources reviewing these\n\nmaterials instead of preparing their witnesses, rehearsing their arguments, and otherwise\n\npreparing for a lengthy bench trial. Ultimately, it is unclear what impact Plaintiffs’ late\n\n\n                                                 48\n\fproduction had on Defendants’ ability to prepare for trial. Defendants did not ask for a\n\ncontinuance based on Plaintiffs’ late production, but it was not in Defendants’ interest to delay\n\nthe trial, so the Court cannot assume that Defendants were not prejudiced by the untimely\n\ndisclosures.\n\n       Based on the damning contents of many of the documents, Defendants speculate that\n\nPlaintiffs acted in bad faith and abused the discovery process by waiting until before trial to\n\nproduce them. Plaintiffs indicated to the Court that a computer problem had inadvertently caused\n\nthese documents to be omitted from its prior production of documents during discovery. See\n\n[170] Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. to Amend the Joint Pretrial Stmt. at 2. Plaintiffs’ former counsel\n\nhas presented the Court with a declaration indicating that he was unaware until October 2010 that\n\nadditional emails existed that had not been produced. See Decl. of Arnold E. Rosenfeld ¶ 11.\n\nWhile the Court is willing to accept the declaration of Plaintiffs’ former counsel as an officer of\n\nthe Court that documents were not deliberately withheld until the eve of trial by legal counsel, it\n\nis unclear whether Plaintiffs acted recklessly or otherwise breached their obligation to timely\n\nsupplement their discovery responses. Therefore, the Court shall require Plaintiffs to provide the\n\nCourt with a more specific explanation as to why they did not produce these documents during\n\ndiscovery. The Court may order payment of reasonable expenses caused by Plaintiffs’ untimely\n\nproduction pursuant to Rule 26(c)(1) if the Court is not satisfied with Plaintiffs’ response. The\n\nCourt shall hold in abeyance Defendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees with respect to the untimely\n\nproduction of these documents.\n\n       D.      Defendants’ Petition for Involuntarily Dissolution\n\n       On February 16, 2011, Defendants filed a [198] Petition for Involuntary Dissolution\n\n\n                                                 49\n\fasking this Court to begin the involuntarily dissolution of AGM&M pursuant to the procedures in\n\nthe District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act, D.C. Code §§ 29-301.01 to 301.114.\n\nPursuant to D.C. Code § 29-301.55, the Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n       The court shall have full power to liquidate the assets and affairs of a corporation:\n\n       (1) In any action by a member or director when it is made to appear:\n\n               (A) That the directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate\n               affairs and that irreparable injury to the corporation is being suffered or is\n               threatened by reason thereof, and either that the members are unable to break\n               the deadlock or there are no members having voting rights;\n\n               (B) That the acts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are\n               illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent;\n\n               (C) That the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or\n\n               (D) That the corporation is unable to carry out its purposes[.]\n\nD.C. Code § 29-301.55(a). The Nonprofit Corporation Act sets out specific procedures for\n\nliquidation proceedings. See id. §§ 29-301.55 to 301.60.\n\n       As the Court explained in a Memorandum Opinion and Order issued on February 17,\n\n2011, following passage of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act,\n\nPub. L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (1970), all powers over nonprofit corporation liquidation are\n\nvested in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. See [202] Mem. Op. & Order at 5-6.\n\nThe Court suggested, however, that it might be appropriate to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\nover Defendants’ petition for involuntary dissolution, and the Court asked the parties to submit\n\nbriefing on this issue. Defendants filed a response to the Court’s order addressing the issue of\n\njurisdiction, and Plaintiffs have filed an opposition to Defendants’ petition, to which Defendants\n\nfiled a reply. Therefore, the issue is ripe for the Court’s resolution.\n\n\n                                                  50\n\f        The supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1367, provides that “the district courts\n\nshall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the\n\naction within [the courts’] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or\n\ncontroversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.” 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). However,\n\nthe statute provides that a court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where (1) the\n\nclaim raises a novel or complex issue of state law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over\n\nthe claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the court has\n\ndismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) in exceptional circumstances,\n\nthere are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction. Id. § 1367(c).\n\n        Many federal courts have recognized that claims for corporate dissolution involve special\n\nstate interests that may be disrupted or frustrated by the exercise of federal jurisdiction, and the\n\nexistence of state procedures for dissolution may require federal courts to abstain from exercising\n\njurisdiction.

Accordingly, the Court is reluctant to assert jurisdiction\n\nover a matter that is nearly always handled exclusively by the local courts of the District of\n\nColumbia.\n\n       Defendants argue that the Court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\npetition because the Court has already invested a substantial amount of time in this litigation and\n\nis familiar with the problems facing AGM&M. However, while the Court may be familiar with\n\nsome of the facts that are relevant to Defendants’ petition, Defendants did not assert this claim\n\nfor relief in their Streamlined Counterclaims or any of their pretrial briefs, and this claim was not\n\nlitigated by the parties at trial.13 Resolution of Defendants’ petition would require additional\n\nfindings of fact by the Court following “a hearing had upon such notice as the court may direct to\n\nbe given to all parties to the proceedings and to any other parties in interest designated by the\n\ncourt.”14 D.C.

Hirair Hovnanian was dismissed as a party at the summary judgment\nstage. Anoush Mathevosian and Van Krikorian have never been parties, although Van Krikorian\n\n                                                 52\n\ffinally disposed of the parties’ original claims, which is an additional reason to decline the\n\nexercise of supplemental jurisdiction.

Defendants’ Motion for Order to Show Cause as to Why Plaintiffs Should Not Be\n                Held in Comtempt\n\n        On March 21, 2011, Defendants filed a [214] Request for Order to Show Cause as to\n\nWhy Plaintiffs Should Not Be Held in Contempt. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have\n\nviolated one of this Court’s orders by relocating certain materials maintained by the Armenian\n\nNational Institute (“ANI”) off the premises of the Families U.S.A. building. Plaintiffs do not\n\ndispute that ANI has moved its materials out of the Families U.S.A. building, but they contend\n\nthat they should not be held in contempt because ANI is a separate legal entity that is not a party\n\nto this litigation and the Court did not expressly order it to keep its belongings in the Families\n\nU.S.A. building. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that there is no basis for finding them in\n\ncontempt.\n\n        Following the completion of closing arguments at trial, the Court asked the parties if they\n\n\nattended the trial as the corporate representative of the Assembly. According to Defendants, the\nCFF-designated trustee of AGM&M is now John Williams, Defendants’ trial counsel. It is\nunclear whether Mr. Williams could continue to represent Defendants through any dissolution\nproceedings in light of his present status as a trustee.\n\n                                                 53\n\fwould agree not to take any actions with respect to the properties pending the Court’s ruling.\n\nBecause the reversion date of December 31, 2010 was approaching soon after trial, the Court\n\nwanted assurances that the parties would not attempt to enforce the Grant Agreement or change\n\nthe status quo while the Court was in the process of deciding the case. Plaintiffs agreed that they\n\nwould wait until the Court’s ruling before taking action. Defendants also agreed that they would\n\nnot take any actions with respect to the buildings, but they raised a concern about “the ANI\n\nsituation,” referring to the materials being stored in the Families U.S.A. building and the staff\n\nworking there. See Trial Tr. (11/29) at 168. In response, the Court stated:\n\n       I would hope that while we await my decisions that nothing happens to them or they\n       get moved or anything else. I’d prefer not to enter an order because I’m sure—unless\n       you can reach an agreement about what both sides need to do. If you can reach some\n       stipulation or some sort of consent order, I’d be happy to sign something until I make\n       a decision.\n\nId. at 168-69. Defendants complained about the lack of an enforcement mechanism and asked\n\nfor a right of inspection. See id. at 170-71. The Court then inquired as to whether there was\n\ninventory of the materials kept by ANI, and Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the Court (after\n\nconferring with Dr. Rouben Adalian, who was present in the courtroom), that there was not a\n\nprecise inventory. Id. at 171. Plaintiffs’ counsel told the Court that nothing had happened to the\n\nmaterials for a long time since the litigation began, and Plaintiffs agreed that nothing should\n\nhappen to them pending the Court’s decision. The Court then told the parties several times that\n\nthey should try to reach an agreement about this issue before asking the Court to enter an order:\n\n       Let me make the suggestion, in order to enter some sort of order you either have to\n       agree to it or you need to file something in terms of what my authority would be.\n       ANI, technically, is not a party, although they are under you, it’s under the umbrella\n       of [AGM&M], I’d have to take a look at that more carefully. So, I’m just saying that\n       this is not something I would do off the top of my head. If you can reach some\n\n\n                                                 54\n\f       agreement that just simply says nothing gets moved by anybody that relates to this\n       until I make this decision, that would be helpful. Once I make a decision, I will bring\n       you back to have some discussion further.\n\n       ...\n\n       [I]f you can agree to something, that would be most helpful. Just leave everybody\n       with nobody moving or doing anything, that would be helpful. If you can’t do that\n       and you still feel strongly, then file something and then I’ll take a look at it. I prefer\n       not to put my resources into that. But why don’t you have a discussion about it.\n\n       ...\n\n       As I said, I would prefer that you have discussion about it, see if you can resolve\n       something. If you want me to sign something, fine. Reach a stipulation, however\n       you want to do it. If you can’t, then you need to file something. I’m not going to do\n       it today without your filing something in writing.\n\n       ...\n\n       [W]hat I’m asking is nobody move anything. I mean, in other words, we’ve\n       been—you’ve been on pause while we’ve been waiting for this for at least—at least\n       for a couple of years at the end [of the] year. So, don’t change anything. I mean, you\n       can accept new donations, but don’t move the property or make changes to the thing.\n       To the extent that you want to put something—stipulate that nobody—either side is\n       going to do anything, then that would be helpful. But I’ll do this as fast as I can. But\n       if you’re not satisfied, then file something in writing and I’ll litigate it. But I would\n       suggest that you talk and see whether you can do it on a more amicable basis.\n\nId. at 171-75. The parties did not present any stipulation or agreement to the Court for\n\nratification, nor did the parties file any motions asking the Court to enter an Order.\n\n       Defendants argue that the removal of the ANI materials from the Families U.S.A.\n\nbuilding, which apparently occurred after the Court issued its Memorandum Opinion on January\n\n26, 2011, violated the Court’s oral admonition that “nobody move anything.” However, as\n\nshould have been clear from the context, the Court’s statement was not intended to constitute a\n\n\n\n\n                                                  55\n\fbinding order on ANI.15 Even if the Court had intended to impose a binding obligation, ANI’s\n\nactions would not justify a finding of contempt. The record presented by Plaintiffs demonstrates\n\nthat ANI waited until after the Court issued its January 26, 2011 Memorandum Opinion before\n\nmoving its materials to an offsite storage facility, where they remain under the supervision of Dr.\n\nAdalian. See Decl. of Dr. Rouben Adalian ¶¶ 3-6, 11, 14. Therefore, there is no basis to\n\nconclude that ANI’s assets have been wasted.\n\n       For these reasons, the Court finds that there is no basis for holding Plaintiffs in contempt,\n\nand the Court shall deny Defendants’ request for a show cause order.\n\n                                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Grant Agreement clearly and\n\nunambiguously requires AGM&M to transfer the Bank Building and the Adjacent Properties to\n\nCFF without any reimbursement requirement and without regard to any tax consequences that\n\nmight result from the transfer. Therefore, the Court shall order AGM&M to effect the transfer of\n\nthe properties without further delay in compliance with D.C. law. The Court reaffirms its ruling\n\nthat Cafesjian and Waters are entitled to indemnification from AGM&M for their attorneys’ fees\n\nin defending the claims asserted against them for breaching their fiduciary duty to AGM&M, but\n\nthe Court shall refer this issue to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation. The\n\nmagistrate judge shall review the expenses submitted by Defendants and make recommendations\n\nas to which of the claimed expenses should be subject to indemnification; the Court shall review\n\nthe magistrate judge’s report and recommendation and make a final ruling as to the amount of the\n\n\n       15\n         This Court has never determined that ANI is a party to this litigation or that AGM&M\nor the Assembly has control over ANI. The record at trial indicated only that the AGM&M\nBoard of Trustees had the right to appoint the Board of Governors of ANI.\n\n                                                56\n\findemnification. The Court shall also deny-in-part Defendants’ [221] Motion Requesting\n\nAttorneys’ Fees for Vexatious Litigation because Defendants have mostly failed to demonstrate\n\nthat Plaintiffs or their counsel acted recklessly or in bad faith. However, the Court shall hold in\n\nabeyance Defendants’ motion with respect to Plaintiffs’ untimely production of documents on the\n\neve of trial and require Plaintiffs to more clearly explain why they did not produce these\n\ndocuments during discovery.\n\n       The Court shall decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Defendants’ [198]\n\nPetition for Involuntary Dissolution of AGM&M, as this is a new claim asserted after trial that is\n\nbest left to be adjudicated by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n\n       Finally, the Court shall deny Defendants’ [214] Request for Order to Show Cause as to\n\nWhy Plaintiffs Should Not Be Held In Contempt because Defendants have not shown that\n\nPlaintiffs violated one of this Court’s orders.\n\n       Because the Court has now finally disposed of all the parties’ claims except for\n\ndetermining the amount of indemnification, the Court shall direct entry of final judgment\n\npursuant to Rule 54(b) as to all claims except for Defendants’ claim for legal fees and expenses\n\nunder the indemnification provision of the AGM&M By-Laws (Count VII of their Streamlined\n\nCounterclaims). An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\nDate: May 9, 2011                                              /s/\n                                                       COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                                       United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                  57\n\f</pre>",
