The panel first held that the district court did\nnot err by determining that plaintiff waived his claim that his\nprior litigation activity against the prison triggered retaliation\ngiven his acknowledgment, in his own motion for summary\njudgment, that the disciplinary report was not issued because\nof his other litigation activities.\n\n    The panel held that the access-to-court doctrine did not\nprovide plaintiff with constitutional protection. The panel\nfurther held that because of the general incompatibility\nbetween prison and free association, and because there was\nno evidence of expressive association, the First Amendment\ndid not protect plaintiff’s attempted service of process on a\nprison official.\n\n\n\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

FRAPPIEA\n\n                                    I\n\n                                   A\n\n     The State of Hawaii contracts with the Corrections\nCorporation of America (“CCA”) to house some of its\nprisoners within the Saguaro Correctional Center, a privately\noperated prison in Eloy, Arizona.1 Richard Blaisdell is one of\nthose inmates. On April 23, 2008, Blaisdell visited Christina\nFrappiea—the prison’s Classification Supervisor—to ask her\nto notarize a document for a new lawsuit he planned to file\nagainst the prison.2 This was not Blaisdell’s first attempt at\nlitigation. He had filed at least three lawsuits against the\nprison and its officers since 2007. Frappiea notarized the\ndocument.\n\n    As soon as Frappiea had finished, Blaisdell announced\nthat she had been “served” and handed her a summons and\ncomplaint in a federal civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act (“RICO”) suit prepared by another\nprisoner: Anthony Gouveia. Blaisdell had agreed to serve\nprocess as a favor to Gouveia and was not a party to his\nlawsuit. The suit against Frappiea concerned her apparent\nunwillingness to notarize a contract for Gouveia which\n\n\n  1\n    Because Blaisdell’s claim regarding retaliation was not conclusively\nresolved until summary judgment, see infra Part I.B., we “draw all\nreasonable inferences supported by the evidence in favor of [Blaisdell as]\nthe non-moving party.” Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d\n1054, 1061 (9th Cir. 2002).\n    2\n   The classification supervisor’s job is to make recommendations about\ninmate placement so that prisoners are “assigned to the appropriate job,\nhousing and rehabilitative programs.” The record is silent about whether\nnotarizing court documents was part of Frappiea’s official duties.\n\f                      BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                               5\n\npertained to a lawsuit he had already filed in Mississippi\nfederal district court. After looking at the document,\nFrappiea reportedly said: “Oh. Well, you can’t serve that.\nYou’re a state prisoner.” Blaisdell claims he replied by\nstating: “[T]his is not a state suit and I have every legal right\nin the world to serve this to you. I am over 18, and I’m not a\nparty to the suit. And it’s not breaking any laws or any rules\nor anything.”\n\n    Following this exchange of words, Frappiea prepared a\ndisciplinary report charging Blaisdell with Conspiracy,\nFailure to Follow Rules, and “Violation of Federal, State or\nLocal Laws.” Under the prison rules inmates are not\npermitted to possess another inmate’s property, including his\nlegal paperwork, without permission. The “Conspiracy” was\nBlaisdell’s agreement to possess Gouveia’s summons and\ncomplaint. As for the laws transgressed, Frappiea’s\ndisciplinary report references Arizona statutes that spell out\nthe requirements to act as a process server. Frappiea later\ncharacterized Blaisdell’s legal violation as a failure to comply\nwith the screening provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct (“PLRA”) before attempting service. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1915A.3 A CCA hearing officer found Blaisdell guilty on\nall three counts and sentenced him to sixty days of\nadministrative segregation.\n\n                                    B\n\n    Proceeding pro se, Blaisdell initiated the instant litigation\nin Arizona Superior Court. The case was removed to federal\n\n\n  3\n    Frappiea has no formal legal education and acknowledged that her\ncharacterization of Blaisdell’s legal violation was a “good faith,” although\npotentially inaccurate, interpretation of the PLRA.\n\f6                        BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\ndistrict court where Blaisdell subsequently filed an amended\npro se complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 containing four\ncounts. Count One claimed that his discipline in connection\nwith the events of April 23 had been unconstitutional\nretaliation. Counts Two, Three, and Four asserted violations\nof the Due Process Clause, Arizona state law, and the federal\nFreedom of Information Act. He sought $10,000 in\ncompensatory and punitive damages.\n\n    Pursuant to the PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c), the district\ncourt sua sponte screened the complaint, dismissing Counts\nTwo, Three, and Four. During its screening, the district court\nperceived two distinct assertions within Count One. First, the\ncourt identified an allegation of retaliation by Frappiea for\nBlaisdell’s attempt to serve Gouveia’s lawsuit. Second, the\ncourt identified a possible assertion that Frappiea had\nprepared the disciplinary charge “to get even” with Blaisdell\nfor his own prior lawsuits against CCA and its officers. The\ncourt’s screening order, while expressing the view that\nBlaisdell’s service of process was not an actionable basis for\na retaliation claim, did not definitively screen that allegation.\nInstead, the order simply directed Frappiea to file an answer\nas to Count One.\n\n     Following discovery, both sides moved for summary\njudgment.4 Frappiea argued in her motion that (1) Blaisdell’s\n“actions as a process server [did] not constitute protected\nconduct” under the Constitution and (2) there was no causal\n“nexus between the disciplinary report and [Blaisdell’s]\nlitigation activity.” The district court agreed that Blaisdell’s\nservice of process was not constitutionally protected. As for\nBlaisdell’s own litigation activity, the court observed that, in\n\n    4\n        Blaisdell’s cross motion for summary judgment was denied.\n\f                   BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                      7\n\nresponding to Frappiea’s summary judgment briefing,\nBlaisdell had disclaimed a claim for retaliation on that basis.\nThe court concluded that “[f]or this reason alone,” any such\ntheory of retaliation necessarily failed.\n\n   Blaisdell timely appealed from the order granting\nsummary judgment to Frappiea and received court-appointed\ncounsel.\n\n                               II\n\n    Blaisdell first argues that the district court erred in\ndetermining that he waived the claim that his prior litigation\nactivity against the prison triggered retaliation.\n\n    Courts in this circuit have an obligation to give a liberal\nconstruction to the filings of pro se litigants, especially when\nthey are civil rights claims by inmates. See Thomas v.\nPonder, 611 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir. 2010); Bretz v.\nKelman, 773 F.2d 1026, 1027 n.1 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc).\nThis rule relieves pro se litigants from the strict application\nof procedural rules and demands that courts not hold missing\nor inaccurate legal terminology or muddled draftsmanship\nagainst them. See, e.g., Agyeman v. I.N.S., 296 F.3d 871, 877\n(9th Cir. 2002) (“Albeit inartfully, Aygeman raised pro se his\ndue process claims . . . . [notwithstanding that] he did not use\nthe specific phrase ‘due process violation’. . . .’”).\n\n    In this case, Blaisdell wrote in his summary judgment\nbriefing that “[t]he issue in this case is not whether Frappiea\nwrote a false D.R. [disciplinary report] because of plaintiff’s\nmultiple lawsuits, it is because plaintiff legally served\nFrappiea with a federal summons and complaint naming her\nas a defendant in a Mississippi lawsuit.” (emphasis in\n\f8                     BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\noriginal). Through counsel, Blaisdell now argues that our\ndecision in Bretz and the rule of liberal construction compel\nus to ignore his statement.\n\n    In Bretz, we construed a pro se claim “drafted in terms of\n§ 1983” as arising instead under section 1985—a related\ncivil-rights provision. 773 F.2d at 1027 n.1. Blaisdell is not\nasking us to identify which legal terminology describes his\ncause of action; instead, he is asking us to take up on appeal\na claim which he clearly told the district court he was not\nbringing. We decline to do so. See Zixiang Li v. Kerry, 710\nF.3d 995, 1000 n.4 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[A] party waives an\nargument by failing to make it before the district court . . . .”)\n(quoting G & S Holdings LLC v. Cont’l Cas. Co., 697 F.3d\n534, 538 (7th Cir. 2012) (alterations and omission in\noriginal)).\n\n    Without resort to Orwellian “Newspeak,” liberal\nconstruction cannot turn Blaisdell’s explanation about what\nhis “case is not” into a description about what his case is. In\npart, we credit his disavowal because it conforms with how\nhe described his claim at other times during the litigation. He\nused a form complaint designed to aid prisoners proceeding\npro se. When the form complaint prompted him to state the\nright violated, Blaisdell wrote: “Retaliation against the\nplaintiff for exercising his right to serve Federal Summons\nand Complaint on Frappiea.”5 Then, in his own motion for\nsummary judgment Blaisdell argued that “Frappiea wrote a\ndisciplinary report on plaintiff as a result of [p]laintiff’s\nattempt to serve [d]efendant with a valid lawful federal\n\n\n    5\n   It is also salient that a claim based on Blaisdell’s own litigation would\nnever have been recognized were it not for the district court’s liberal\nconstruction during screening.\n\f                      BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                               9\n\nsummons and complaint” and stated that he was “entitled to\nperform the only act he did and that was to serve Frappiea.”\n\n    Blaisdell’s “acknowledg[ment] that the disciplinary report\nwas not issued because of his other litigation activities”\ncompels the conclusion that Frappiea is entitled to summary\njudgment on the retaliation claim to the extent it is based on\nprior lawsuits.\n\n                                    III\n\n   Blaisdell’s remaining claim for retaliation therefore\nhinges on whether he engaged in “protected conduct” when\nhe served process on another inmate’s behalf. Rhodes v.\nRobinson, 408 F.3d 559, 567 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n    Resolving this question requires us to wade into doctrinal\nwaters not often explored in detail by courts. Although\ncommonly referred to as claims for “First Amendment\nretaliation,” id., such actions need not be tethered to the\nspeech or associational freedoms secured by that Bill of\nRights provision.6        Instead—as an aspect of the\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine—a claim for retaliation\ncan be based upon the theory that the government imposed a\nburden on the plaintiff, more generally, “because he\nexercise[d] a constitutional right.” Regan v. Taxation With\nRepresentation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 545 (1983); see\nalso Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674\n(1996) (situating several cases alleging retaliation for\n\n\n 6\n   The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of\ngrievances.” U.S. Const. amend. I.\n\f10                     BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\nprotected speech amidst the “modern unconstitutional\nconditions doctrine” (internal quotation marks omitted)).7\nBlaisdell directs us to two possible sources of constitutional\nprotection for his effort to serve process for his fellow inmate.\n\n                                     A\n\n    Blaisdell first points to a “prisoner’s right of meaningful\naccess to the courts.” Bradley v. Hall, 64 F.3d 1276, 1279\n(9th Cir. 1995), overruled on other grounds by Shaw v.\nMurphy, 532 U.S. 223, 230 n.2 (2001). In the context of\nprisoners’ rights, the Supreme Court chiefly has located the\naccess-to-courts doctrine in the Constitution’s Due Process\nand Equal Protection Clauses. See, e.g., Lewis v. Casey, 518\nU.S. 343, 367 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring) (observing that\nover the decades the Court has characterized the right “as a\n‘consequence’ of due process, as an ‘aspect’ of equal\nprotection, or as an ‘equal protection guarantee’” (internal\ncitations omitted)). At other times, the Court has described\nthe doctrine as part of every citizen’s First Amendment right\nto petition the government. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n78, 84 (1987) (“[P]risoners retain the constitutional right to\npetition the government for the redress of grievances . . . .”);\nCal. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508,\n\n\n\n\n 7\n   Perhaps not any constitutional right will suffice, however. According\nto one scholar, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine only safeguards\n“those rights that depend on some sort of exercise of autonomous choice\nby the rightholder, such as individual rights to speech, exercise of religion\nor privacy, corporate rights to do interstate business or invoke federal\ndiversity jurisdiction, or state rights to self-government.” Kathleen M.\nSullivan, Unconstitutional Conditions, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1413, 1426\n(1989).\n\f                       BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                             11\n\n510 (1972) (“The right of access to the courts is indeed but\none aspect of the right of petition.”).8\n\n    Blaisdell argues that two access-to-courts principles cover\nhis conduct: (1) a right to pursue “litigation-related activities”\nand (2) the right of legal assistance between inmates.\n\n                                     1\n\n    Prisoners have the “right[] to litigate without active\ninterference,” Silva v. Di Vittorio, 658 F.3d 1090, 1102 (9th\nCir. 2011), a guarantee that exists so prisoners have a “viable\nmechanism to remedy prison injustices.” Rhodes v.\nRobinson, 408 F.3d 559, 567 (9th Cir. 2005). The heart of the\nanti-interference right is “the presentation of constitutional,\ncivil rights and habeas corpus claims,” Snyder v. Nolen, 380\nF.3d 279, 291 (7th Cir. 2004).9 But, by virtue of their\n“broader right to petition the government for a redress of\n[their] grievances under the First Amendment,” Bradley, 64\nF.3d at 1279, prisoners must also have opportunities to pursue\ncertain other types of civil litigation. See, e.g., Snyder, 380\nF.3d at 291; Straub v. Monge, 815 F.2d 1467, 1470 (11th Cir.\n1987); Jackson v. Procunier, 789 F.2d 307, 311 (5th Cir.\n1986).\n\n\n\n 8\n   The exercise of rights while in prison, though, is cabined. See Turner,\n482 U.S. at 89 (“[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates’\nconstitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.”).\n     9\n       The access-to-courts right originated with direct appeals from\nconvictions and habeas corpus and then was extended “only slightly, to\n‘civil rights actions’—i.e., actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate\n‘basic constitutional rights.’” Lewis, 518 U.S. at 354.\n\f12                     BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\n    The exact nature of Gouveia’s lawsuit is unknown.\nAccording to Blaisdell, it was “was a personal suit and had\nnothing to do with the Saguaro Prison.” We will look past\nthis statement, however, since the complaint which Blaisdell\nsought to serve did concern a perceived injustice at Saguaro:\nFrappiea’s alleged refusal to notarize a contract for Gouveia\nin connection with his underlying civil action. Therefore, we\nassume for the sake of argument that Gouveia’s claim against\nFrappiea is the type of civil suit covered by the First\nAmendment’s right to petition.\n\n    Yet, the Supreme Court has cautioned that despite some\npast imprecision in its articulation of the protection, access-\nto-courts rights do not exist in an “abstract, freestanding”\nform. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 351. Instead, they are tethered to\nprinciples of Article III standing. See id. (remarking that\n“actual injury is apparent on the face of almost all the\nopinions in the 35-year line of access-to-courts cases”).10 For\nthere to be a judicially cognizable injury, “the party before\n[the court] must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible\nharm.” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2661 (2013)\n(emphasis added); see also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747,\n767 (1982) (describing “the personal nature of constitutional\nrights” as a “cardinal principle[] of our constitutional order”).\nThus, while Gouveia and Blaisdell each have an access-to-\ncourts right to file litigation from prison, they cannot\n\n\n\n\n 10\n     This reflects the fact that in our system of separated powers “it is not\nthe role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the\ninstitutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and\nthe Constitution.” Lewis, 518 U.S. at 349.\n\f                      BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                           13\n\nvicariously assert that protection on each other’s behalf.11\nAnd because Blaisdell has no share in Gouveia’s “right to be\nfree from interference,” this aspect of the access-to-courts\ndoctrine cannot support his action. Silva, 658 F.3d at 1103.\n\n                                    2\n\n    Blaisdell next claims that Frappiea’s disciplinary report\nwas issued to retaliate against him for providing affirmative\nlegal assistance to his fellow inmate. See Johnson v. Avery,\n393 U.S. 483, 490 (1969). “We have traditionally\ndifferentiated between two types of access-to-court claims:\nthose involving prisoners’ right to affirmative assistance and\nthose involving prisoners’ rights to litigate without active\ninterference.” Silva, 658 F.3d at 1102. A close inspection of\nJohnson and its progeny illustrates that, as with the access\ndoctrine already explored, Blaisdell misconceives the true\nnature of the right to assistance.\n\n    Constitutional doctrine requires that inmates receive\naffirmative assistance in the “preparation and filing” of\ncertain legal pleadings. Silva, 658 F.3d at 1102 (quoting\nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977)). However, the\nConstitution does not specify the form such assistance must\ntake. In Johnson, the Tennessee prison system had a\nregulation barring inmates from advising or assisting each\n\n 11\n    Because of loose language in access-to-courts precedents before Lewis\nthis issue had divided the lower courts. Compare Adams v. James, 784\nF.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir. 1986) (“In a non-class-action context a\nprisoner has no standing to litigate another prisoner’s claim of denial of\naccess to the courts.”), with Rhodes v. Robinson, 612 F.2d 766, 769 (3d\nCir. 1979) (reading prior Supreme Court caselaw on access to courts as\n“disregard[ing] the rule against Jus tertii, the vicarious assertion of\nrights”).\n\f14                 BLAISDELL V.

The Court\ninvalidated that rule—not because prisoners have a\nconstitutional right to “the assistance of fellow inmates”—but\nbecause Tennessee failed to provide any other mechanism for\nhelping inmates who were incapable of preparing legal papers\nthemselves. See id. (explaining that “unless and until the\nState provides some reasonable alternative to assist inmates\nin the preparation of petitions for post-conviction relief, it\nmay not validly enforce [the] regulation”); Smith v.\nMaschner, 899 F.2d 940, 950 (10th Cir. 1990) (“Prison\ninmates do not possess the right to a particular prisoner’s help\nin preparing their legal materials, so long as prison officials\nmake other assistance available.”); Kunzelman v. Thompson,\n799 F.2d 1172, 1179 (7th Cir. 1986) (holding that the “right\nto receive assistance from other prisoners is conditioned upon\na showing that the inmates in question did not have adequate\naccess to the court without the help of an inmate writ-\nwriter”).\n\n    Confronted with arguments akin to Blaisdell’s in the years\nsince Johnson, the Supreme Court has made the contingent\nnature of the protection for legal assistance explicit. See\nShaw, 532 U.S. at 231 n.3 (“Under our right-of-access\nprecedents, inmates have a right to receive legal advice from\nother inmates only when it is a necessary means for ensuring\na reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed\nviolations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.”\n(quoting Lewis, 518 U.S. at 350–51 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). CCA’s Corporate and Facilities Policy provides\nfor a law library and for contract attorneys or paralegals to\nhelp inmates prepare motions to proceed in forma pauperis,\nmotions for appointment of counsel, habeas petitions, and\n§ 1983 suits. Blaisdell does not challenge either the\nsufficiency or the enforcement of that access-to-courts policy.\n\f                       BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                             15\n\nHe also acknowledges that the federal rules furnished\nGouveia with potential ways to effectuate service.12\nMoreover, it is far from clear that “the right to provide legal\nadvice follows from a right to receive legal advice,” Shaw,\n531 U.S. at 231 n.3, a crucial leap were Blaisdell to have\nstanding to claim the disciplinary charge impinged on the\nexercise of his rights. Cf. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 351–52.\n\n   For all of these reasons, Blaisdell’s decision to serve\nprocess on behalf of Gouveia cannot be grounded on the\naccess-to-court doctrine.\n\n                                     B\n\n   As an alternative vehicle for constitutional protection,\nBlaisdell invokes the freedom of “association for the\nadvancement of beliefs and ideas.” NAACP v. Button, 371\nU.S. 415, 430 (1963).13\n\n\n 12\n     Rule 4 provides that at a “plaintiff’s request, the court may order that\nservice be made by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a\nperson specially appointed by the court. The court must so order if the\nplaintiff is authorized to proceed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1915.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c). See generally Laurence v. A.T. Wall, 551\nF.3d 92, 93–94 (1st Cir. 2008). The fact that Gouveia paid the filing fee\nin lieu of seeking in forma pauperis designation does not automatically\ngive him an access-to-courts claim. At the very least, there would need\nto be evidence that the court refused his request for service as well as\nevidence that the prison furnished no alternative mechanism for inmate\nservice. Blaisdell has offered no such evidence.\n 13\n    Not expressly enumerated, this freedom is a consequence of the First\nAmendment’s textual guarantees. See Roberts v. United States Jaycees,\n468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984) (“An individual’s freedom to speak, to worship,\nand to petition the government for the redress of grievances could not be\nvigorously protected from interference by the State unless a correlative\n\f16                     BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\n     Blaisdell cites Rizzo v. Dawson, 778 F.2d 527 (9th Cir.\n1985) as support for the proposition that he has a viable\nassociational claim. In Rizzo, we held that “a ‘jailhouse\nlawyer’ assisting other inmates with habeas petitions and\nother federal actions” was engaging in expressive association\nunder the First Amendment. 778 F.2d at 529. Rizzo\nprovided his legal assistance during a prison-vocational\ncourse; thus, we held that he could viably allege that his\nforced transfer out of the course had been in retaliation for his\nexercise of the constitutional right to associate. Blaisdell’s\nown evidence, however, shows that he does not function as a\njailhouse lawyer, or anything approaching it. In his statement\nof facts in support of summary judgment, he wrote: “All of\nthe points on accusing me of helping other inmates at Saguaro\nare fictitious and false because I have not helped any other\n[inmates] with their lawsuits at Saguaro.”14 Blaisdell further\nrepresented having “had nothing to do with the drafting or\nfiling of Gouveia’s lawsuit.” Because Blaisdell does not\nengage in the kind of activity which Rizzo held was protected,\nthat case is not controlling here.\n\n    In effect, Blaisdell encourages us to extend Rizzo and to\nhold that service of process, divorced from substantive legal\nassistance, qualifies as First Amendment association. Two\n\n\nfreedom to engage in group effort toward those ends were not also\nguaranteed.”).\n 14\n    The portion of the record he cited in his appellate brief, ostensibly as\nevidence that he offers legal assistance, does not put this representation at\nissue. There, he discusses a disciplinary action which “accused [him] of\nattempting to encourage Washington inmates to file lawsuits against CCA\nfor violation of their civil rights.” Blaisdell testified that while he might\nhave offhandedly stated “Well, sue them,” he could not “even remember\nthe incident.”\n\f                     BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                           17\n\ndoctrinal developments since 1985 convince us that it does\nnot.\n\n    First, the Court has clarified that associational rights only\nextend to groups engaged in expressive activities. See Boy\nScouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 648 (2000); Villegas v.\nCity of Gilroy, 484 F.3d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir. 2007).15 In\nDale, the Boy Scouts qualified as expressive because its\n“general mission” was inculcating members with a set of\nvalues “both expressly and by example.” 530 U.S. at 649–50.\nSimilarly, fraternal and civic associations usually can invoke\nthe freedom of association. See, e.g., Roberts v. United States\nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 612 (1984) (national men’s\norganization devoted to “genuine Americanism and civil\ninterest” was protected).\n\n    Unable to cite to these conventional modes of association,\nBlaisdell simply asserts that civil rights litigation is “a form\nof political expression.” Button, 371 U.S. at 429. In Button,\nthe NAACP had associational rights because it worked “to\nvindicate the legal rights of members of the American Negro\ncommunity, [and] at the same time and perhaps more\nimportantly, ma[de] possible the distinctive contribution of a\nminority group to the ideas and beliefs of our society.” 371\nU.S. at 431. Such litigation was deemed political expression\nand thus protected “political association.” Id. When the\nCourt held that the ACLU’s litigation also was protected, it\ndid so based on the ACLU’s “extensive educational and\nlobbying activities” and involvement in public-interest cases\nranging from “political dissent, juvenile rights, prisoners’\n\n\n  15\n     In Villegas, we cabined a 1984 precedent that had declared that the\nHells Angels’ motorcycle club had associational rights without analyzing\nthis doctrinal requirement. Id. at 1141 n. 10.\n\f18                    BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\nrights, military law, amnesty, and privacy.” In re Primus,\n436 U.S. 412, 427–28 (1978).\n\n      While inmates engaged in collective civil rights litigation\nconceivably could claim to be expressively associating,16 the\nsame cannot be said for the one-time service of process at\nissue here. Service of process has no inherently expressive\ndimension. Cf. Villegas, 484 F.3d at 1141 (“act of wearing\n. . . vests adorned with a common insignia simply does not\namount to the sort of expressive conduct protected by the\nFirst Amendment”). Instead, it merely is a procedural\nmechanism for announcing that legal proceedings have\nbegun.\n\n    A second reason not to extend Rizzo is that its holding is\ndifficult to square with the Supreme Court’s subsequent\nteachings on prisoners’ rights. See Pratt v. Rowland, 65 F.3d\n802, 807 (9th Cir. 1995) (cautiously applying Rizzo in light of\nlater admonitions). As a general matter, the Court has\ninstructed that “freedom of association is among the rights\nleast compatible with incarceration.” Overton v. Bazzetta,\n539 U.S. 126, 131 (2003). More specifically, the Court\noverruled a decision of ours which—relying on Rizzo—held\nthat an inmate law clerk had heightened First Amendment\nprotection because he was a purveyor of legal assistance. See\nMurphy v. Shaw 195 F.3d 1121, 1124–25 (9th Cir. 1999),\n\n  16\n     As a three-judge panel, we respect Rizzo as binding despite some\ndissatisfaction with its reasoning. The Tenth Circuit authority that Rizzo\nregarded as persuasive, strikes us as wrongly decided. See Owens v. Rush,\n654 F.2d 1370, 1379 (10th Cir.1981) (concluding that by helping his wife\nwith her Title VII suit and “accompan[ying] [her] to her attorney’s office”\na husband came “within the activities held to be protected by the First\nAmendment in NAACP v. Button”). Helping one’s spouse with a single\nlawsuit does not transform the couple into an expressive association.\n\f                      BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                             19\n\noverruled by Shaw, 532 U.S. at 227, 230–32. Blaisdell\ncorrectly notes that Shaw fell short of holding that prisoners\nhave no First Amendment rights when assisting each other\nwith legal matters. Shaw concerned a more discrete issue: it\nheld that deferential scrutiny still applies when courts assess\nthe validity of prison regulations affecting inmate legal\nassistance. See 532 U.S. at 228. Yet, not only did the Court\nexpress skepticism about the right we declared in Rizzo,17 it\nreminded us that: (1) “the constitutional rights that prisoners\npossess are more limited in scope than the constitutional\nrights held by individuals in society at large” and (2) “courts\nare particularly ‘ill equipped’ to deal with” issues which arise\nbehind bars. Shaw, 532 U.S. at 229; see also id. at 228\n(“Traditionally federal courts did not intervene in the internal\naffairs of prisons and instead ‘adopted a broad hands-off\nattitude toward problems of prison administration.’”).\n\n    Because of questions about Rizzo’s vitality, the general\nincompatibility between prison and free association, and\nbecause there is no evidence of expressive association, we\nconclude that the First Amendment does not protect\nBlaisdell’s attempted service of process on Frappiea.\n\n\n\n\n   17\n      The skepticism is apparent both in the unanimous majority and the\nconcurrence. See id. at 231 (explaining in dicta that “even if we were to\nconsider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based upon\ncontent, we would not do so for speech that includes legal advice”), id.\n(remarking that “inmate law clerks are sometimes a menace to prison\ndiscipline”) (internal quotation marks omitted); id. at 232 (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring) (“I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding\nthat the First Amendment secures to prisoners a freestanding right to\nprovide legal assistance to other inmates.”).\n\f20                BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\n                              IV\n\n    As any alleged retaliation against Blaisdell was not rooted\nin activity safeguarded by the Constitution, the district court\nproperly awarded summary judgment in favor of Frappiea.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\f",

FRAPPIEA\n\n                                    I\n\n                                   A\n\n     The State of Hawaii contracts with the Corrections\nCorporation of America (“CCA”) to house some of its\nprisoners within the Saguaro Correctional Center, a privately\noperated prison in Eloy, Arizona.1 Richard Blaisdell is one of\nthose inmates. On April 23, 2008, Blaisdell visited Christina\nFrappiea—the prison’s Classification Supervisor—to ask her\nto notarize a document for a new lawsuit he planned to file\nagainst the prison.2 This was not Blaisdell’s first attempt at\nlitigation. He had filed at least three lawsuits against the\nprison and its officers since 2007. Frappiea notarized the\ndocument.\n\n    As soon as Frappiea had finished, Blaisdell announced\nthat she had been “served” and handed her a summons and\ncomplaint in a federal civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act (“RICO”) suit prepared by another\nprisoner: Anthony Gouveia. Blaisdell had agreed to serve\nprocess as a favor to Gouveia and was not a party to his\nlawsuit. The suit against Frappiea concerned her apparent\nunwillingness to notarize a contract for Gouveia which\n\n\n  1\n    Because Blaisdell’s claim regarding retaliation was not conclusively\nresolved until summary judgment, see infra Part I.B., we “draw all\nreasonable inferences supported by the evidence in favor of [Blaisdell as]\nthe non-moving party.” Villiarimo v.

FRAPPIEA                               5\n\npertained to a lawsuit he had already filed in Mississippi\nfederal district court. After looking at the document,\nFrappiea reportedly said: “Oh. Well, you can’t serve that.\nYou’re a state prisoner.” Blaisdell claims he replied by\nstating: “[T]his is not a state suit and I have every legal right\nin the world to serve this to you. I am over 18, and I’m not a\nparty to the suit. And it’s not breaking any laws or any rules\nor anything.”\n\n    Following this exchange of words, Frappiea prepared a\ndisciplinary report charging Blaisdell with Conspiracy,\nFailure to Follow Rules, and “Violation of Federal, State or\nLocal Laws.” Under the prison rules inmates are not\npermitted to possess another inmate’s property, including his\nlegal paperwork, without permission. The “Conspiracy” was\nBlaisdell’s agreement to possess Gouveia’s summons and\ncomplaint. As for the laws transgressed, Frappiea’s\ndisciplinary report references Arizona statutes that spell out\nthe requirements to act as a process server. Frappiea later\ncharacterized Blaisdell’s legal violation as a failure to comply\nwith the screening provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct (“PLRA”) before attempting service. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1915A.3 A CCA hearing officer found Blaisdell guilty on\nall three counts and sentenced him to sixty days of\nadministrative segregation.\n\n                                    B\n\n    Proceeding pro se, Blaisdell initiated the instant litigation\nin Arizona Superior Court. The case was removed to federal\n\n\n  3\n    Frappiea has no formal legal education and acknowledged that her\ncharacterization of Blaisdell’s legal violation was a “good faith,” although\npotentially inaccurate, interpretation of the PLRA.\n\f6                        BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\ndistrict court where Blaisdell subsequently filed an amended\npro se complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 containing four\ncounts. Count One claimed that his discipline in connection\nwith the events of April 23 had been unconstitutional\nretaliation. Counts Two, Three, and Four asserted violations\nof the Due Process Clause, Arizona state law, and the federal\nFreedom of Information Act. He sought $10,000 in\ncompensatory and punitive damages.\n\n    Pursuant to the PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c), the district\ncourt sua sponte screened the complaint, dismissing Counts\nTwo, Three, and Four. During its screening, the district court\nperceived two distinct assertions within Count One. First, the\ncourt identified an allegation of retaliation by Frappiea for\nBlaisdell’s attempt to serve Gouveia’s lawsuit. Second, the\ncourt identified a possible assertion that Frappiea had\nprepared the disciplinary charge “to get even” with Blaisdell\nfor his own prior lawsuits against CCA and its officers. The\ncourt’s screening order, while expressing the view that\nBlaisdell’s service of process was not an actionable basis for\na retaliation claim, did not definitively screen that allegation.\nInstead, the order simply directed Frappiea to file an answer\nas to Count One.\n\n     Following discovery, both sides moved for summary\njudgment.4 Frappiea argued in her motion that (1) Blaisdell’s\n“actions as a process server [did] not constitute protected\nconduct” under the Constitution and (2) there was no causal\n“nexus between the disciplinary report and [Blaisdell’s]\nlitigation activity.” The district court agreed that Blaisdell’s\nservice of process was not constitutionally protected. As for\nBlaisdell’s own litigation activity, the court observed that, in\n\n    4\n        Blaisdell’s cross motion for summary judgment was denied.\n\f                   BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                      7\n\nresponding to Frappiea’s summary judgment briefing,\nBlaisdell had disclaimed a claim for retaliation on that basis.\nThe court concluded that “[f]or this reason alone,” any such\ntheory of retaliation necessarily failed.\n\n   Blaisdell timely appealed from the order granting\nsummary judgment to Frappiea and received court-appointed\ncounsel.\n\n                               II\n\n    Blaisdell first argues that the district court erred in\ndetermining that he waived the claim that his prior litigation\nactivity against the prison triggered retaliation.\n\n    Courts in this circuit have an obligation to give a liberal\nconstruction to the filings of pro se litigants, especially when\nthey are civil rights claims by inmates.

FRAPPIEA\n\n    The exact nature of Gouveia’s lawsuit is unknown.\nAccording to Blaisdell, it was “was a personal suit and had\nnothing to do with the Saguaro Prison.” We will look past\nthis statement, however, since the complaint which Blaisdell\nsought to serve did concern a perceived injustice at Saguaro:\nFrappiea’s alleged refusal to notarize a contract for Gouveia\nin connection with his underlying civil action. Therefore, we\nassume for the sake of argument that Gouveia’s claim against\nFrappiea is the type of civil suit covered by the First\nAmendment’s right to petition.\n\n    Yet, the Supreme Court has cautioned that despite some\npast imprecision in its articulation of the protection, access-\nto-courts rights do not exist in an “abstract, freestanding”\nform. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 351. Instead, they are tethered to\nprinciples of Article III standing. See id.

See\nShaw, 532 U.S. at 231 n.3 (“Under our right-of-access\nprecedents, inmates have a right to receive legal advice from\nother inmates only when it is a necessary means for ensuring\na reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed\nviolations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.”\n(quoting Lewis, 518 U.S. at 350–51 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). CCA’s Corporate and Facilities Policy provides\nfor a law library and for contract attorneys or paralegals to\nhelp inmates prepare motions to proceed in forma pauperis,\nmotions for appointment of counsel, habeas petitions, and\n§ 1983 suits.

Cf. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 351–52.\n\n   For all of these reasons, Blaisdell’s decision to serve\nprocess on behalf of Gouveia cannot be grounded on the\naccess-to-court doctrine.\n\n                                     B\n\n   As an alternative vehicle for constitutional protection,\nBlaisdell invokes the freedom of “association for the\nadvancement of beliefs and ideas.” NAACP v.

In his statement\nof facts in support of summary judgment, he wrote: “All of\nthe points on accusing me of helping other inmates at Saguaro\nare fictitious and false because I have not helped any other\n[inmates] with their lawsuits at Saguaro.”14 Blaisdell further\nrepresented having “had nothing to do with the drafting or\nfiling of Gouveia’s lawsuit.” Because Blaisdell does not\nengage in the kind of activity which Rizzo held was protected,\nthat case is not controlling here.\n\n    In effect, Blaisdell encourages us to extend Rizzo and to\nhold that service of process, divorced from substantive legal\nassistance, qualifies as First Amendment association.

In Button,\nthe NAACP had associational rights because it worked “to\nvindicate the legal rights of members of the American Negro\ncommunity, [and] at the same time and perhaps more\nimportantly, ma[de] possible the distinctive contribution of a\nminority group to the ideas and beliefs of our society.” 371\nU.S. at 431. Such litigation was deemed political expression\nand thus protected “political association.” Id. When the\nCourt held that the ACLU’s litigation also was protected, it\ndid so based on the ACLU’s “extensive educational and\nlobbying activities” and involvement in public-interest cases\nranging from “political dissent, juvenile rights, prisoners’\n\n\n  15\n     In Villegas, we cabined a 1984 precedent that had declared that the\nHells Angels’ motorcycle club had associational rights without analyzing\nthis doctrinal requirement.

Service of process has no inherently expressive\ndimension. Cf. Villegas, 484 F.3d at 1141 (“act of wearing\n. . . vests adorned with a common insignia simply does not\namount to the sort of expressive conduct protected by the\nFirst Amendment”). Instead, it merely is a procedural\nmechanism for announcing that legal proceedings have\nbegun.\n\n    A second reason not to extend Rizzo is that its holding is\ndifficult to square with the Supreme Court’s subsequent\nteachings on prisoners’ rights. See Pratt v. Rowland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703954\"><a href=\"/opinion/703954/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7323-95-daily-journal-dar-12497-elmer-pratt-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807 (9th Cir. 1995) (cautiously applying Rizzo in light of\nlater admonitions). As a general matter, the Court has\ninstructed that “freedom of association is among the rights\nleast compatible with incarceration.” Overton v. Bazzetta,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130150\"><a href=\"/opinion/130150/overton-v-bazzetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 (2003). More specifically, the Court\noverruled a decision of ours which—relying on Rizzo—held\nthat an inmate law clerk had heightened First Amendment\nprotection because he was a purveyor of legal assistance. See\nMurphy v. Shaw </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766688\"><a href=\"/opinion/766688/kevin-murphy-v-robert-shaw-unit-sergeant-larry-bearley-hearings-officer/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124–25 (9th Cir. 1999),\n\n  16\n     As a three-judge panel, we respect Rizzo as binding despite some\ndissatisfaction with its reasoning. The Tenth Circuit authority that Rizzo\nregarded as persuasive, strikes us as wrongly decided. See Owens v. Rush,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392709\"><a href=\"/opinion/392709/26-fair-emplpraccas-226-26-empl-prac-dec-p-31929-james-owens-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1379 (10th Cir.1981) (concluding that by helping his wife\nwith her Title VII suit and “accompan[ying] [her] to her attorney’s office”\na husband came “within the activities held to be protected by the First\nAmendment in NAACP v. Button”). Helping one’s spouse with a single\nlawsuit does not transform the couple into an expressive association.\n\f                      BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA                             19\n\noverruled by Shaw, 532 U.S. at 227, 230–32. Blaisdell\ncorrectly notes that Shaw fell short of holding that prisoners\nhave no First Amendment rights when assisting each other\nwith legal matters. Shaw concerned a more discrete issue: it\nheld that deferential scrutiny still applies when courts assess\nthe validity of prison regulations affecting inmate legal\nassistance. See 532 U.S. at 228. Yet, not only did the Court\nexpress skepticism about the right we declared in Rizzo,17 it\nreminded us that: (1) “the constitutional rights that prisoners\npossess are more limited in scope than the constitutional\nrights held by individuals in society at large” and (2) “courts\nare particularly ‘ill equipped’ to deal with” issues which arise\nbehind bars. Shaw, 532 U.S. at 229; see also id. at 228\n(“Traditionally federal courts did not intervene in the internal\naffairs of prisons and instead ‘adopted a broad hands-off\nattitude toward problems of prison administration.’”).\n\n    Because of questions about Rizzo’s vitality, the general\nincompatibility between prison and free association, and\nbecause there is no evidence of expressive association, we\nconclude that the First Amendment does not protect\nBlaisdell’s attempted service of process on Frappiea.\n\n\n\n\n   17\n      The skepticism is apparent both in the unanimous majority and the\nconcurrence. See id. at 231 (explaining in dicta that “even if we were to\nconsider giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based upon\ncontent, we would not do so for speech that includes legal advice”), id.\n(remarking that “inmate law clerks are sometimes a menace to prison\ndiscipline”) (internal quotation marks omitted); id. at 232 (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring) (“I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding\nthat the First Amendment secures to prisoners a freestanding right to\nprovide legal assistance to other inmates.”).\n\f20                BLAISDELL V. FRAPPIEA\n\n                              IV\n\n    As any alleged retaliation against Blaisdell was not rooted\nin activity safeguarded by the Constitution, the district court\nproperly awarded summary judgment in favor of Frappiea.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
