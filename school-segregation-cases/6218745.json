We find that it\n\ndid.\n\n       The Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes jointly inhabit the\n\nWind River Reservation. The State of Wyoming and the Wyoming Farm Bureau\n\nFederation challenge a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency granting\n\nthe Tribes’ application for joint authority to administer certain non-regulatory\n\nprograms under the Clean Air Act on the Reservation. As part of their application\n\nfor administrative authority, the Tribes were required to show they possess\n\njurisdiction over the relevant land. In their application, the Tribes described the\n\nboundaries of the Wind River Reservation and asserted that most of the land\n\nwithin the original 1868 boundaries fell within their jurisdiction.\n\n       Wyoming and others submitted comments to the EPA arguing the\n\nReservation had been diminished in 1905 by act of Congress, and that some land\n\ndescribed in the application was no longer within tribal jurisdiction. After\n\nreview, the EPA determined the Reservation had not been diminished in 1905 and\n\nthe Tribes retained jurisdiction over the land at issue. Because the EPA decided\n\nthe Tribes otherwise satisfied Clean Air Act program requirements, it granted\n\ntheir application.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f      Wyoming and the Farm Bureau appealed the EPA’s Reservation boundary\n\ndetermination. Regionally applicable final actions of the EPA are directly\n\nappealable to this court. Exercising jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1), we\n\ngrant the petition for review, vacate the EPA’s boundary determination, and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We find by its 1905\n\nlegislation, Congress evinced a clear intent to diminish the Reservation.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n      The history of federal Indian policy in the United States is marked by a\n\nseries of eras, each characterized by a different approach to the inevitable conflict\n\nbetween the Native Americans who inhabited western America and homesteaders\n\nflooding west in search of a better life. Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law\n\n7–8 (Nell Jessup Newton et al. eds., 2012). The story of the Wind River\n\nReservation begins in the second half of the nineteenth century, when a new\n\nfederal policy of allotment and assimilation began to take shape, which followed\n\na period when Indian reservations were created throughout the western United\n\nStates. Unsurprisingly, westward expansion placed pressures on the traditional\n\nlifestyles of the Native American tribes. Recognizing the potential for conflicts,\n\nparticularly over land, the United States negotiated a series of treaties and\n\nagreements with dozens of tribes, including the Eastern Shoshone.\n\n      The Eastern Shoshone are part of the larger Shoshone Tribe, who in the\n\nmid-nineteenth century inhabited what would become the states of Colorado,\n\n                                         -5-\n\fIdaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. Henry Stamm, People of the Wind River 9\n\n(1999). In 1863, the United States and the Eastern Shoshone entered into the\n\nFirst Treaty of Fort Bridger, 18 Stat. 685 (1863), which established “Shoshonee\n\nCounty,” an area encompassing more than forty-four million acres. See United\n\nStates v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians of Wind River Reservation of Wyo., 304 U.S.\n\n111, 113 (1938). But the treaty proved to be short lived. With the end of the\n\nCivil War, a new wave of settlers forged westward. Fearing the Eastern\n\nShoshone’s homeland would be settled and thus lost forever, the tribal leader,\n\nChief Washakie, urged the United States to reserve the Wind River Valley—the\n\nTribe’s historic buffalo hunting grounds—as the Eastern Shoshone’s permanent\n\nhomeland.\n\n      Chief Washakie’s efforts were successful: in 1868, the United States and\n\nthe Eastern Shoshone Tribe signed the Second Treaty of Fort Bridger, 15 Stat.\n\n673 (1868). This treaty set aside roughly three million acres for exclusive tribal\n\nuse. In exchange, the Tribe relinquished its claim to the land held under the 1863\n\ntreaty. Shoshone, 304 U.S. at 113. As it had promised, the United States\n\ndeveloped the Reservation’s infrastructure and began to establish and expand\n\nagricultural lands in an effort to aid the Eastern Shoshone’s transition away from\n\nhunting wild game, which was rapidly disappearing. For their part, the Eastern\n\nShoshone resolved to settle permanently on the Reservation, pursue an agrarian\n\nlifestyle, and send their children to school. But land issues persisted: settlers vied\n\n                                          -6-\n\ffor agricultural lands south of the Big Wind River, and the Reservation’s\n\nsuperintendent feared it would be impossible to observe the boundaries created by\n\nthe 1868 treaty.\n\n      Meanwhile, Congress had departed from its previous policy of segregating\n\ntribes from homesteaders in favor of a new policy of educating Native American\n\nchildren in residential boarding schools and splitting up communal, tribally\n\nowned reservations into individual, privately owned parcels of land. Judith V.\n\nRoyster, The Legacy of Allotment, 27 Ariz. St. L.J. 1, 7–9 (1995). At the time,\n\nCongress, and indeed most of America, assumed the reservation system would\n\neventually cease to exist and members of Native American tribes would become\n\nfully assimilated into American society. See Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463, 468\n\n(1984); Marta Adams et al., American Indian Law Deskbook 93 (2015). Thus,\n\nreservations began to shrink in size. In 1874, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe sold all\n\nof its land south of the forty-third parallel in the so-called Lander Purchase in\n\nexchange for a payment of $25,000. 18 Stat. 291, 292 (1874). According to the\n\nratifying act, this transaction “change[d] the southern limit of said reservation.”\n\n18 Stat. at 292. Around this time, the Northern Arapaho—traditionally, an enemy\n\nof the Eastern Shoshone—joined the Eastern Shoshone on the Wind River\n\nReservation, where they remain today. 1877 Comm’r Indian Aff. Ann. Rep. 19.\n\n      The Wind River Reservation boundaries changed again in 1897, when\n\nCongress passed legislation purchasing additional land. That act, known as the\n\n                                          -7-\n\fThermopolis Purchase, provided that, in exchange for $60,000, the Tribes agreed\n\nto “cede, convey, transfer, relinquish, and surrender forever and absolutely all\n\ntheir right, title, and interest of every kind and character” in a tract around the Big\n\nHorn Hot Springs, located on the northern boundary of the Reservation. 30 Stat.\n\n93, 94 (1897). Following up on failed efforts to acquire additional land from the\n\nTribes in 1891 and 1893, in 1904 Representative Frank Mondell of Wyoming\n\nintroduced a bill initiating the cession of the land north of the Big Wind River\n\nflowing through the north-central portion of the Reservation. The 1904\n\nlegislation was the framework for negotiations with the Tribes, which the Tribes\n\nultimately agreed to as amended. Congress passed the 1904 agreement in 1905.\n\n33 Stat. 1016 (1905). It is the 1905 Act that is at issue in this case.\n\n       But the 1905 Act was not the last piece of legislation affecting the\n\nReservation. In 1934, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act, the first\n\nstep in its new national policy of tribal self-determination. See 48 Stat. 984\n\n(1934). Since the Tribes voted to exclude themselves from this Act, however,\n\nCongress had to pass specific legislation to carry out its new policies on the Wind\n\nRiver Reservation. Thus, in 1939, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior\n\nto restore to tribal ownership any unsold lands in the area that had been ceded in\n\n1905. 53 Stat. 1128, 1129 (1939).\n\n      That brings us to the present day. Currently, approximately seventy-five\n\npercent of the land affected by the 1905 Act is held in trust by the United States\n\n                                          -8-\n\ffor the Tribes and their members. In 2008, the Tribes applied to the EPA for\n\nauthority to manage certain non-regulatory programs for air quality in areas under\n\ntribal jurisdiction. They were able to do so because in 1990, Congress amended\n\nthe Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401–671 (CAA), to authorize the EPA to treat\n\nNative American tribes as states for the purposes of the CAA. § 7601(d).\n\nPursuant to this grant of authority, the EPA promulgated the Tribal Authority\n\nRule, 40 C.F.R. 49, under which qualified tribes may apply for authority to\n\nimplement and manage programs for air quality in areas under tribal jurisdiction.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 7601(d)(2)(B).\n\n      A successful application must describe the area over which a tribe seeks to\n\nassert its regulatory authority. Thus, in their application, the Tribes had to\n\nspecify the proposed scope of their regulatory jurisdiction, which required them\n\nto clearly delineate the boundaries of the Reservation. The Tribes claimed the\n\nboundaries of the Wind River Reservation were those set forth in the 1868 treaty,\n\nreduced only by the Lander and Thermopolis transactions. As required by the\n\nCAA, the EPA notified all governmental entities located contiguous to the\n\nReservation and provided local government and the general public notice and an\n\nopportunity to comment on the proposed boundary description. When a\n\ntreatment-as-a-state application is subject to an objection, EPA may also request\n\nadditional information or consult with the Department of the Interior. 40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 49.9(d).\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      In their comments, Wyoming and the Farm Bureau argued the Reservation\n\nwas diminished by the 1905 Act, which, they contended, established the current\n\nboundaries of the Reservation. Based on these objections, the EPA asked the\n\nDepartment of the Interior for an analysis of the competing claims. In 2011, the\n\nsolicitor issued a legal opinion concluding the 1905 Act had not changed the\n\nboundaries established by the 1868 treaty. Relying on this analysis, the EPA\n\nissued its final decision granting the Tribes’ application. The decision agreed\n\nwith the Tribes’ interpretation that the 1905 Act did not diminish the boundaries\n\nof the Reservation.\n\n                                   II. Analysis\n\n      Our task here is limited: we must determine whether Congress diminished\n\nthe Wind River Reservation in 1905 by legislative act. ** As we have previously\n\n\n      **\n           We must also address two jurisdictional issues:\n\n       (1) In response to the court’s November 17, 2015 order for supplemental\nbriefing regarding a mootness issue raised during oral argument, we have\nreviewed the parties’ and intervenors’ supplemental briefs and find this case is\nnot moot. Mootness is a threshold requirement: without the existence of a live\ncase or controversy, we cannot constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over a claim.\nRio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of Reclamation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1110 (10th\nCir. 2010). For a live controversy to exist, a present determination of the issues\nmust have “some effect in the real world,” and the parties must retain a concrete\ninterest in the outcome of the litigation. Id. at 1109–10. Here, even though the\nEPA has revoked the Tribes’ funding under the CAA, the EPA’s determination of\nthe Reservation boundaries still stands, and the EPA has not indicated it will\nreconsider its decision. Because the boundary determination affects the present\nand future rights and responsibilities of the parties, the case is not moot.\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                         -10-\n\fexplained, only Congress has the power to diminish reservation boundaries, and\n\nits intent “must be clearly expressed.” Osage Nation v. Irby, 597 F.3d 1117,\n\n1121–22 (10th Cir. 2010). Even further, diminishment “will not be lightly\n\ninferred.” Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463, 470 (1984). Nevertheless, we may not\n\n“‘ignore plain language that, viewed in historical context and given a fair\n\nappraisal clearly runs counter to a tribe’s later claims.’” Osage Nation, 597 F.3d\n\nat 1122 (quoting Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Yazzie, 909 F.2d 1387,\n\n1393 (10th Cir. 1990)).\n\n      The Supreme Court has declined to infer a congressional purpose of\n\ndiminishment from the passage of every surplus land act during the allotment and\n\nassimilation period. “Rather, it is settled law that some surplus land acts\n\ndiminished reservations, and other surplus land acts did not.” Solem, 465 U.S. at\n\n\n      **\n         (...continued)\n       (2) We also find the Wyoming Farm Bureau has standing to sue on behalf\nof its members. For an organization to bring suit in its representative capacity, it\nmust show, among other things, that “its members would otherwise have standing\nto sue in their own right.” Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S.\n333, 343 (1977). Standing requires a concrete and particularized injury that is\ntraceable to the defendant’s conduct and redressable by a favorable court\ndecision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). In this\ncase, some Farm Bureau members own farms within the disputed area and face\nthe costs of complying with a new regulatory regime following the EPA’s\ndecision. We have previously recognized precisely this type of injury as\nsufficiently concrete and particularized. See Hydro Res., Inc. v. EPA, 608 F.3d\n1131, 1144 (10th Cir. 2010). And since the alleged injuries are clearly traceable\nto the EPA’s decision and would be redressed by a reversal of that decision, Farm\nBureau members have standing to sue in their own right. Therefore, we find the\nFarm Bureau has standing to sue on behalf of its members.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f469 (citations omitted). “The effect of any given surplus land Act depends on the\n\nlanguage of the Act and the circumstances underlying its passage.” Id. To\n\ndetermine whether the 1905 Act had the effect of diminishing the Reservation, we\n\nlook to the well-settled approach described in Solem, where the Court outlined a\n\nhierarchical, three-step framework to ascertain congressional intent.\n\n      First, we look to the text of the statute, because it is “[t]he most probative\n\nevidence of congressional intent.” Id. at 470; see also Nebraska v. Parker, 136 S.\n\nCt. 1072, 1079 (2016) (“[W]e start with the statutory text, for ‘[t]he most\n\nprobative evidence of diminishment is, of course, the statutory language used to\n\nopen Indian lands.’” (citation omitted) (second alteration in original)).\n\n      Second, we examine the circumstances surrounding the passage of the act,\n\n“particularly the manner in which the transaction was negotiated with the tribes\n\ninvolved and the tenor of legislative reports presented to Congress.” Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471; see also Parker, 136 S. Ct. at 1079; South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux\n\nTribe, 522 U.S. 329, 351–52 (1998).\n\n      Third and finally, “to a lesser extent,” we look to “the subsequent treatment\n\nof the area in question and the pattern of settlement there.” Id. at 344; Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471–72.\n\n      In doing so, we afford no deference to the EPA’s boundary determination.\n\nAs our precedents tell us, “‘the Supreme Court has applied, without comment, a\n\nde novo standard of review in determining congressional intent [regarding\n\n                                         -12-\n\freservation boundary diminishment].’” Osage Nation, 597 F.3d at 1122\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Yazzie, 909 F.2d at 1393). Although examination\n\nof the historical record “involves a mixed question of law and fact,” de novo\n\nreview is appropriate “[w]here a mixed question ‘primarily involves the\n\nconsideration of legal principles.’” Id. at 1393–94 (quoting Supre v. Ricketts, 792\n\nF.2d 958, 961 (10th Cir. 1986)). The EPA does not dispute this standard of\n\nreview, because it concedes a de novo standard is “consistent with the\n\n[Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘otherwise not in accordance with the law’\n\nstandard,” Aple. EPA Br. 23, which we apply to the agency action here.\n\n      A. The Text of the 1905 Act\n\n      We begin our analysis with the 1905 Act’s operative language, for\n\n“[s]tatutory language is the most probative evidence of congressional intent to\n\ndisestablish or diminish a reservation.” Osage Nation, 597 F.3d at 1122–23.\n\n“‘Explicit reference to cession or other language evidencing the present and total\n\nsurrender of all tribal interests strongly suggests that Congress meant to divest\n\nfrom the reservation all unallotted opened lands.’” Id. at 1123 (quoting Solem,\n\n465 U.S. at 470). There are no magic words of cession required to find\n\ndiminishment. Rather, the statutory language, whatever it may be, must\n\n“establis[h] an express congressional purpose to diminish.” Hagen v. Utah, 510\n\nU.S. 399, 411 (1994).\n\n      Here, Article I of the 1905 Act reads,\n\n                                        -13-\n\f             The said Indians belonging on the Shoshone or Wind River\n             Reservation, Wyoming, for the consideration hereinafter\n             named, do hereby cede, grant, and relinquish to the United\n             States, all right, title, and interest which they may have to\n             all the lands embraced within said reservation, except the\n             lands within and bounded by the following lines . . . .\n\n33 Stat. at 1016 (emphasis added). This language of cession aligns with the type\n\nof language the Supreme Court has called “precisely suited” to diminishment.\n\nYankton Sioux, 522 U.S. at 344. Indeed, it is nearly identical to the statutory\n\nlanguage in cases where the Supreme Court has found a congressional purpose to\n\ndiminish a reservation in the statute’s text.\n\n      For example, in DeCoteau v. District County Court for the Tenth Judicial\n\nDistrict, the Court considered an act providing that the Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribe\n\nagreed to “cede, sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States all their claim,\n\nright, title, and interest in and to all the unallotted lands within the limits of the\n\nreservation.” 420 U.S. 425, 445 (1975). The Court found this language was\n\nprecisely suited to a congressional purpose of terminating the Lake Traverse\n\nIndian Reservation. Id. Similarly, in Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, the Court\n\nheld Congress clearly evinced an intent to diminish the boundaries of the Rosebud\n\nSioux Reservation when it passed a series of acts affecting unallotted lands on\n\nthat reservation. 430 U.S. 584, 615 (1977). The first act, passed in 1904,\n\nprovided that the Rosebud Sioux Tribe agreed to “cede, surrender, grant, and\n\nconvey to the United States all their claim, right, title, and interest in and to” the\n\n                                           -14-\n\funallotted portion of its reservation. Id. at 597. This too, the Court held, was\n\nlanguage precisely suited to diminishment. Id. ***\n\n      Two decades later, in Hagen, the Court found Congress evinced a clear\n\nintent to diminish a reservation even when it employed less express language of\n\ncession. The operative language of the statute at issue provided that “all the\n\nunallotted lands within said reservation shall be restored to the public domain.”\n\n510 U.S. at 412. The Court held this language evidenced a congressional intent\n\n“inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status.” Id. at 414. **** And in\n\nYankton Sioux, the Court unanimously held Congress spoke with a clear purpose\n\nof diminishment when it passed an act providing that the Yankton Sioux Tribe\n\nwould “cede, sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States all their claim,\n\nright, title, and interest in and to all the unallotted lands within the limits of the\n\nreservation.” 522 U.S. at 344, 351.\n\n\n\n\n      ***\n          Although the 1907 and 1910 Acts in Rosebud merely authorized the\nSecretary of the Interior “to sell or dispose of” the unallotted portions, the court\nfound a “continuity of intent” from the earlier 1904 Act and a 1901 agreement,\nbased on the circumstances surrounding the passage of the later acts. Id. at\n606–13.\n      ****\n           Citing to Hagen, the EPA argues that when the operative language does\nnot restore ceded lands to the public domain, diminishment is less likely. We\ndisagree. While the Court in Hagen found language restoring lands to the public\ndomain probative of congressional intent to diminish a reservation, nowhere did it\nsuggest the absence of public domain language cuts against diminishment—\nespecially where, as here, the statute’s operative language includes even stronger\nlanguage of cession than in Hagen.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f      In contrast, in cases where the Court has found a lack of clear\n\ncongressional intent to diminish, the operative language of the statutes merely\n\nopened a reservation to settlement by non-Indians or authorized the Secretary of\n\nthe Interior to act as a “sales agent” for the Native American tribes. For example,\n\nin Seymour v. Superintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary, the Court concluded\n\nthat an act providing “for the sale of mineral lands and for the settlement and\n\nentry under the homestead laws of surplus lands remaining on the diminished\n\nColville Reservation after allotments were first made . . . did no more than open\n\nthe way for non-Indian settlers to own land on the reservation.” ***** 368 U.S. 351,\n\n354–56 (1962). Similarly, in Mattz v. Arnett, the Court held an act providing that\n\nlands within a reservation were “subject to settlement, entry, and purchase” did\n\nnot, on its own, “recite or even suggest that Congress intended thereby to\n\nterminate the Klamath River Reservation.” 412 U.S. 481, 495–97 (1973).\n\n      The operative language in Solem itself was similar: the act merely\n\n“authorized and directed” the Secretary of the Interior “to sell and dispose of all\n\nthat portion of the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Indian reservations” within\n\nthe described boundaries. 465 U.S. at 472–73. The Court compared the language\n\n\n      *****\n             The Tenth Circuit distinguished Seymour in Ellis v. Page, stating, “It\nis one thing to open an Indian Reservation to mineral exploitation, allotment to\nIndians, and non-Indian homesteaders by Congressional enactment as in Seymour.\nIt is quite another to agree by treaty to cede and relinquish all claim, title and\ninterest in the lands within the limits of a reservation.” 351 F.2d 250, 252 (10th\nCir. 1965)\n\n                                        -16-\n\fto the acts in Rosebud and DeCoteau and concluded that unlike in those cases,\n\n“the Secretary of the Interior was simply being authorized to act as the Tribe’s\n\nsales agent.” Id. at 473. The Court added, “Nowhere else in the Act is there\n\nspecific reference to the cession of Indian interests in the opened lands or any\n\nchange in existing reservation boundaries.” Id. at 474. ****** Likewise, just last\n\nyear in Parker, the Court held that an act stating the disputed lands would be\n\n“‘open for settlement under such rules and regulations as [the Secretary of the\n\nInterior] may prescribe,’” 136 S. Ct. at 1079 (alteration in original) (quoting 22\n\nStat. 341 (1882)), fell into the category of acts that “‘merely opened reservation\n\nland to settlement,’” id. (quoting DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 448). *******\n\n\n\n\n      ******\n             The Court in Solem did acknowledge that language of diminishment\npresent elsewhere in the act undisputedly supported the view that the reservation\nhad been diminished. 465 U.S. at 474–75. Without express language of cession,\nhowever, isolated references to diminishment alone could not “carry the burden of\nestablishing an express congressional purpose to diminish.” Id. at 475. Here, in\ncontrast, in addition to the express language of cession in Article I, Articles I, III,\nIV, VI, and IX of the 1905 Act refer to the diminished reservation. 33 Stat. at\n1016, 1017, 1018, 1020, 1022.\n      *******\n              The EPA points to a circuit case, United States v. Grey Bear, which\nit argues falls outside this framework. 828 F.2d 1286 (8th Cir. 1987). That case\ninvolved an interpretation of cession language for the Devils Lake Indian\nReservation that is similar to Rosebud, DeCoteau, and here, but unlike these\ncases, the legislative history of the act was quite limited, and the subsequent\ntreatment of the area strongly indicated Congress did not view the act as\ndisestablishing the reservation. Id. at 1290–91. Thus although step one of the\nSolem analysis pointed to diminishment, steps two and three made it clear that\nwas not Congress’s intent.\n\n                                         -17-\n\f      Plainly, the 1905 Act falls into the first line of cases: those with express\n\nlanguage of cession. Nevertheless, the EPA and the Tribes argue that Congress’s\n\nintent remains unclear, because of the absence of words such as “sell” or\n\n“convey” that were present in other statutes during the period. But our task is not\n\nto divine why Congress may have chosen certain synonyms over others in this\n\nparticular Act. We believe Congress’s use of the words “cede, grant, and\n\nrelinquish” can only indicate one thing—a diminished reservation. A review of\n\nseveral dictionaries from the turn of the twentieth century confirms that adding\n\nthe words “sell” or “convey” would not materially change the intent Congress\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fevinced in the 1905 Act. ******** And in any event, Article II of the 1905 Act\n\nincludes the word “conveyed”:\n\n                 In consideration of the lands ceded, granted, relinquished,\n                 and conveyed by Article I of this agreement, the United\n                 States stipulates and agrees to dispose of the same, as\n                 hereinafter provided . . . .\n\n33 Stat. at 1019–20 (emphasis added). *********\n\n      ********\n               The absence of the words “convey” or “sell” in Article I tells us\nlittle about Congress’s intent, since the contemporaneous definitions of “cede,”\n“grant,” and “relinquish” were virtually indistinguishable from the definitions of\n“convey” and “sell.” For example, at the time, “cede” was defined as “[t]o yield\nor surrender, give up.” Webster’s Commonsense Dictionary 76 (J.T. Thompson\ned., 1902). Likewise, “grant” was defined as “[t]o allow, yield, concede; to\nbestow or confer, in answer to prayer or request; to make conveyance of, give the\npossession or title of.” Webster’s Practical Dictionary 165–66 (1906). And\n“relinquish” was defined as “[t]o give up the possession or occupancy of; to quit;\nto forsake; to abandon; to give up; to resign,” Webster’s Commonsense\nDictionary 405, or “[t]o withdraw from, leave behind; to give up, renounce a\nclaim to, resign, quit, forsake, abandon, forego,” Webster’s Practical Dictionary\n342.\n\n       By way of comparison, “convey” was defined as “to transfer to another,\nmake over,” id. 81, and “[t]o carry; to remove; to transmit,” Webster’s\nCommonsense Dictionary 105. “Sell” was defined as “[t]o give or deliver in\nexchange for some equivalent; to exchange for money,” id. 438, and “[t]o transfer\nto another for an equivalent; to dispose of in return for something, esp. for\nmoney,” Webster’s Practical Dictionary 361. It is true the word “sell” could add\nthe notion of an exchange for money, but the Supreme Court has found a statute’s\noperative language to be “precisely suited” to diminishment without the presence\nof the word “sell.” See Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 597.\n      *********\n               It is worth noting the Wyoming Supreme Court, applying Solem,\nheld the operative language of the 1905 Act evinced Congress’s clear intent to\ndiminish the Reservation. Yellowbear v. State, 174 P.3d 1270, 1282 (Wyo. 2008).\nSpecifically, the court concluded the language of cession in Article I was\n“indistinguishable from the language of DeCoteau.” Id. And upon review of\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                            -19-\n\f      The EPA and the Tribes also argue the lack of unconditional payment of a\n\nsum certain in the 1905 act indicates Congress did not intend to diminish the\n\nReservation. The 1905 Act does not provide for a single, lump-sum payment, but\n\nrather outlines a hybrid payment scheme, under which different amounts derived\n\nfrom the proceeds of sales of the ceded lands are allocated to specific funds. For\n\nexample, the Act provides $150,000 for “the construction and extension of an\n\nirrigation system within the diminished reservation,” $50,000 for a school fund,\n\nand $50,000 for the purchase of livestock. 33 Stat. 1017–18. The Act also\n\ncreates a general welfare and improvement fund and appropriates $85,000 for per\n\ncapita payments of $50 each. 33 Stat. 1018, 1020–21. As we explain in more\n\ndetail below, it was thought this hybrid payment scheme would yield more\n\nrevenue to the tribes, since they would be paid from the proceeds collected from\n\nthe homesteaders.\n\n      In arguing this payment scheme is fatal to a finding of diminishment, the\n\nEPA and the Tribes rely on Solem. There the Court held language of cession\n\ncombined with a sum certain payment creates “an almost insurmountable\n\npresumption that Congress meant for the tribe’s reservation to be diminished.”\n\n\n      *********\n             (...continued)\nYellowbear’s federal habeas petition, we concluded Yellowbear failed to present\nany argument “calling into question the correctness of [the Wyoming Supreme\nCourt’s] decision.” Yellowbear v. Atty. Gen. of Wyo., 380 F. App’x 740, 743\n(10th Cir. 2010), cert. denied sub nom., Yellowbear v. Salzburg, 562 U.S. 1228\n(2011).\n\n                                        -20-\n\f465 U.S. at 470–71. But this presumption is not a two-way street. In Hagen, the\n\nCourt expressly rejected the argument that a finding of diminishment requires\n\n“both explicit language of cession or other language evidencing the surrender of\n\ntribal interests and an unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate\n\nthe Indians.” 510 U.S. at 411 (emphasis added). The Court explained, “While the\n\nprovision for definite payment can certainly provide additional evidence of\n\ndiminishment, the lack of such a provision does not lead to the contrary\n\nconclusion.” Id. at 412. The Court continued, “In fact, the statutes at issue in\n\nRosebud, which we held to have effected a diminishment, did not provide for the\n\npayment of a sum certain to the Indians.” Id. And indeed, in Rosebud, the Court\n\nnoted a sum certain payment or lack thereof is only one of many textual indicators\n\nof congressional intent. 430 U.S. at 598 n.20. Congress’s decision to abandon\n\nthe sum certain method of payment was “not conclusive with respect to\n\ncongressional intent.” ********** Id. at 588. What matters most is not the\n\n\n\n      **********\n                The Court in Rosebud added that the act at issue was not\ncompletely devoid of a guaranteed payment. The Court observed, “[d]espite this\n‘uncertain sum’ proviso,” the act mandated that “all lands herein ceded and\nopened to settlement . . . remaining undisposed of at the expiration of four years\nfrom the taking effect of this Act, shall be sold and disposed of for cash . . . .”\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 596 n.18 (citation omitted). In the Court’s words, such\narrangement “suggests that Congress viewed this land as disestablished\nimmediately.” Id. Similarly, here, the 1905 Act requires “[t]hat any lands\nremaining unsold eight years after the said lands shall have been opened for entry\nmay be sold to the highest bidder for cash without regard to the above minimum\nlimit of price.” 33 Stat. at 1021.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fmechanism of payment, but rather the “language of immediate cession.” Id. at\n\n597.\n\n       Finally, the EPA and the Tribes argue the trusteeship language in the 1905\n\nAct demonstrates that Congress merely meant for the United States to hold the\n\nland in trust for the Tribes until it was sold. The EPA and the Tribes thus believe\n\nthe Act effected no change in ownership until parcels were sold to settlers. They\n\npoint to Article IX of the Act, which provides,\n\n             [N]othing in this agreement contained shall in any manner\n             bind the United States to purchase any portion of the lands\n             herein described or to dispose of said lands except as\n             provided herein, or to guarantee to find purchasers for said\n             lands or any portion thereof, it being the understanding\n             that United States shall act as trustee for said Indians to\n             dispose of said lands and to expend for said Indians and\n             pay over to them the proceeds received from the sale\n             thereof only as received, as herein provided.\n\n33 Stat. at 1020–21. In support of this argument, the EPA relies on similar\n\nlanguage the Court considered in Ash Sheep Co. v. United States, 252 U.S. 159\n\n(1920). There the Court held that the Crow Tribe retained a beneficial interest in\n\nceded lands that precluded them from becoming “public lands.” Id. at 166. But\n\nthe Court has since explained that the question considered in Ash Sheep—whether\n\nlands became “public lands”—is “logically separate” from diminishment. See\n\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 601 n.24. Accordingly, Ash Sheep is seldom mentioned in\n\nsubsequent cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f      In any event, the Court has made clear that trust status is not incongruous\n\nwith congressional intent to diminish a reservation. In Rosebud, for example, the\n\nCourt considered a series of statutes in which the United States did not promise to\n\nfind purchasers for the lands, but rather agreed to act as trustee for the Indians to\n\ndispose of the lands and collect and distribute the proceeds. 430 U.S. at 596, 608.\n\nThe Court held congressional intent was to diminish the Rosebud Reservation,\n\nnotwithstanding the trusteeship provisions. See id. 430 U.S. at 615. The Court\n\nagreed with the Eighth Circuit that “‘the fact that a beneficial interest is retained\n\ndoes not erode the scope and effect of the cession made, or preserve to the\n\nreservation its original size, shape, and boundaries.’” Id. at 601 n.24 (quoting\n\nRosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 521 F.2d 87, 102 (8th Cir. 1975)). Even the\n\ndissent acknowledged, “[o]f course, it is possible that Congress intended to\n\nremove the opened counties from the Reservation while leaving the Indians with a\n\nhost of rights in the counties.” Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 622.\n\n      In sum, the express language of cession in the Act’s operative text, taken\n\ntogether with the Act’s other references to diminishment, strongly suggests that\n\nCongress intended to diminish the boundaries of the Wind River Reservation.\n\nThe lack of a sum certain payment and the inclusion of a trusteeship provision do\n\nnot compel a different conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f      B. The Historical Context of the Act\n\n      The contemporary historical context further confirms Congress intended to\n\ndiminish the Wind River Reservation when it passed the 1905 Act. Although we\n\nbelieve the statutory language points strongly towards diminishment, we also\n\nconsider “the manner in which the transaction was negotiated with the tribes\n\ninvolved and the tenor of legislative reports presented to Congress.” Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471; see also Yankton Sioux, 522 U.S. at 351. As the Supreme Court has\n\nstated, “[e]ven in the absence of a clear expression of congressional purpose in\n\nthe text of a surplus land Act, unequivocal evidence derived from the surrounding\n\ncircumstances may support the conclusion that a reservation has been\n\ndiminished.” Id. Of course, here we need not search for unequivocal evidence,\n\nfor the statute contains express language of cession. But our scrutiny of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the 1905 Act confirms that Congress intended to\n\ndiminish the Reservation’s boundaries.\n\n      The legislative history and the negotiations leading up to the 1905 Act\n\nreveal Congress’s longstanding desire to sever from the Wind River Reservation\n\nthe area north of the Big Wind River. As in Rosebud, “[a]n examination of the\n\nlegislative processes which resulted in the 190[5] Act convinces us . . . that this\n\npurpose was carried forth and enacted.” 430 U.S. at 592. “Because of the history\n\nof the . . . Agreement, the 190[5] Act cannot, and should not, be read as if it were\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fthe first time Congress had addressed itself to the diminution of the [Wind River]\n\nReservation.” See id.\n\n       In 1891, Congress drafted a bill that, had it passed, would have changed the\n\nReservation’s boundaries to exclude the land north of the Big Wind River. Under\n\nthe 1891 agreement, the Tribes were to “cede, convey, transfer, relinquish and\n\nsurrender, forever and absolutely . . . all [the Tribes’] right, title, and interest, of\n\nevery kind and character, in and to the lands, and the water rights appertaining\n\nthereunto” in exchange for the sum of $600,000. H.R. Exec. Doc. No. 52-70, at\n\n29, 30 (1892). Though Congress did not ratify this agreement, two years later the\n\nSecretary of the Interior sent another commission to negotiate with the Tribes for\n\nthe sale of the land north of the Big Wind River. This time, the United States\n\nasked for additional land and offered the Tribes $750,000. H.R. Exec. Doc. No.\n\n53-51, at 4 (1894). Despite the higher offer, the Tribes refused three different\n\nproposals, and no agreement was reached. ***********\n\n       Congressional activity resumed in 1904, when Representative Frank\n\nMondell of Wyoming introduced a bill to further reduce the Wind River\n\nReservation. The 1904 Mondell Bill was based on the 1891 and 1893 proposals.\n\nBut by 1904, the Supreme Court had declared that Congress had plenary authority\n\nover relations with Native Americans, so Congress no longer needed tribal\n\n\n       ***********\n               Congress did successfully obtain the land around the Big Horn\nHot Springs through the Thermopolis purchase in 1897. 30 Stat. at 94.\n\n                                           -25-\n\fapproval to change reservation boundaries. See Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S.\n\n553, 565 (1903). As Representative Thomas Frank Marshall, the Chairman of the\n\nCommittee on Indian Affairs wrote, the 1904 Bill “propose[d] to reduce the\n\nreservation, as suggested . . . at the time of the making of the agreement of\n\n1891 . . . .” H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355, at 3 (1904).\n\n      The Mondell Bill, however, differed from the 1891 agreement in several\n\nrespects. One amendment—and one the EPA and the Tribes point to—was the\n\nelimination of the $600,000 sum certain payment. To that, Representative\n\nMarshall explained, “[The Mondell Bill] follows as closely as possible, under the\n\nchanged conditions and the present policy of Congress relative to payments for\n\nlands purchased from Indians, the agreement of 1891 and the bill prepared at the\n\ntime for carrying out the provisions of that agreement.” H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355,\n\nat 4 (emphasis added). “[The bill] follows the now established rule of the House\n\nof paying to the Indians the sums received from the ceded territory under the\n\nprovisions of the bill.” H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355, at 2; see also H.R. Rep. No. 58-\n\n2355, at 8 (quoting letter from then-Acting Commissioner to the Secretary of the\n\nInterior A. C. Tonner explaining structure of payment framework). Thus, to\n\ncomply with prevailing policy, the sum certain payment was excised and replaced\n\nwith a framework whereby lands would be sold at different times and at different\n\nprices with the proceeds to be transferred to the Tribes. And, incidentally,\n\nCongress believed that the Tribes could realize greater compensation under such a\n\n                                         -26-\n\fframework. H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355, at 4 (observing “[t]he amount which the\n\nIndians would receive at $1 an acre would be $1,480,000”). Such a payment\n\nscheme was the prevailing congressional policy at the time. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has explained, Congress adopted “‘a new policy in acquiring lands from the\n\nIndians [by] provid[ing] that the lands shall be disposed of to settlers . . ., and to\n\nbe paid for by the settlers, and the money to be paid to the Indians only as it is\n\nreceived . . . from the settlers.’” Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 592 (footnote omitted)\n\n(alterations in original).\n\n      Given these congressional directives, in April 1904, Indian Inspector James\n\nMcLaughlin met with the Tribes and presented the terms of the Mondell Bill in a\n\nseries of meetings on the Wind River Reservation. ************ McLaughlin opened\n\nby stating,\n\n              My friends, I am sent here at this time by the Secretary of\n              the Interior to present to you a proposition for the opening\n              of certain p[or]tions of your reservation for settlement by\n              the whites. It is believed that it will be to the best\n              interests of your two tribes to cede to the United States the\n              portions referred to.\n\n\n\n      ************\n                  McLaughlin, who had also negotiated the 1897 Thermopolis\nPurchase, negotiated many land agreements with Native American tribes,\nincluding the Lower Brules, the Otoes, the Missourias, the Klamaths, the Modocs,\nthe Yankton, the Sioux, the Red Lake Chippewas, the Mille Lacs Chippewas, the\nPah-Utes, and the Standing Rock Sioux. James McLaughlin, My Friend the\nIndian 295 (1910). The Supreme Court has reviewed agreements he negotiated\nthat resulted in diminishment in a number of cases, including Rosebud and Hagen.\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fMinutes of Council between James McLaughlin, U.S. Indian Inspector, and the\n\nIndians of the Eastern Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes, at 2 (Apr. 19–21, 1904)\n\n(emphasis added) (reproduced in JA 509–36) [Council Minutes]. But McLaughlin\n\nexplained that since his last agreement with the Tribes, Congress’s policy for\n\npaying for ceded land had changed: “For several years past there has been a\n\nsentiment in Congress . . . opposed to paying the Indians a lump sum\n\nconsideration for their lands. Instead of stipulating, or providing in the\n\nagreement, a lump sum consideration for any tract of land, they have determined\n\nupon giving the Indians the full benefit of the land by paying the Indians from the\n\nproceeds of the sale of the land as whitemen settle upon it.” Council Minutes, at\n\n3. McLaughlin explained to the Tribes that they would “receive more in the\n\naggregate than under the old lump sum agreements.” Council Minutes, at 4.\n\n      McLaughlin advised the Tribes during negotiations that the boundaries of\n\nthe Reservation would change as a result of the Act, just as they would have\n\nunder the agreement in 1891 and the negotiations in 1893. He stated,\n\n             I now wish to talk of the boundaries of the reservation and\n             the residue of land that will remain in your diminished\n             reservation. That being a very important matter. . . . The\n             tract to be ceded to the United States, as proposed by the\n             “Mondell Bill,” is estimated at 1,480,000 acres, leaving\n             800,500 acres in the diminished reservation.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fCouncil Minutes, at 6 (emphasis added). ************* McLaughlin informed the\n\nTribes that “a large reservation is not in your interest,” while the reduction would\n\nbe, and that Congress could now unilaterally change the boundaries of the\n\nReservation if the Tribes did not agree. Council Minutes, at 7.\n\n      Explaining the purpose of the Mondell Bill, McLaughlin told the Tribes\n\nthat this agreement would allow the Tribes to “dispos[e] of the lands that you do\n\nnot need” and that they would “realiz[e] money from the sale of that land, which\n\nwill provide you with means to make yourselves comfortable upon your\n\nreservation . . . .” Council Minutes, at 3. He also referred to the ceded lands as\n\n“the public domain” and made clear the land on the north side of the Big Wind\n\nRiver (part of the ceded territory), after the agreement, would be different:\n\n              Those of you who have allotments on the north side of the\n              river, if you so desire, can have them cancelled and come\n              within the diminished reservation. * * * However, any of\n              you who retain your allotments on the other side of the\n              river can do so, and you will have the same rights as the\n              whiteman, and can hold your lands or dispose of them, as\n              you see fit. On the reservation, you will be protected by\n\n      *************\n                   We acknowledge the Supreme Court stated in Solem that a “few\nscattered phrases” describing agreements as “reducing the reservation,” or “the\nreservation as diminished,” do not indicate a clear congressional purpose to\ndiminish the boundaries of a reservation. 465 U.S. at 478; see also id. at 475 n.17\n(reasoning “‘diminished’ was not yet a term of art in Indian law”). For as the\nCourt observed, “[I]t is unclear whether Congress was alluding to the reduction in\nIndian-owned lands that would occur once some of the opened lands were sold to\nsettlers or to the reduction that a complete cession of tribal interests in the opened\narea would precipitate.” Id. (citation omitted). But here we are not limited to a\nfew ambiguous phrases; rather, we are presented with a more complete set of\ncircumstances similar to those the Supreme Court credited in Rosebud.\n\n                                         -29-\n\f              the laws that govern reservations in all your rights and\n              privileges.\n\n              Furthermore, all of you who may retain your allotments off\n              the reservation, will not lose any of your rights on the\n              reservation, and you have rights the same as if you\n              remained within the diminished reservation. You will\n              have rights to surplus lands, the timber etc, although your\n              home may be on the public domain.\n\nCouncil Minutes, at 14 (emphasis added).\n\n       The tenor of the Tribes’ understanding of the agreement reflects that the\n\nReservation’s boundaries would be diminished. One representative for the\n\nEastern Shoshone told McLaughlin that his Tribe understood it was “parting with\n\n[its lands] forever and [could] never recover [them] again.” Council Minutes, at\n\n17. Long Bear, a chief of the Arapaho Tribe, proclaimed, “I understand what he\n\ncomes for . . . and I will tell what part of the Reservation I want to sell. . . . I\n\nwant to cede that portion of the reservation from the mouth of the Dry Muddy\n\nGulch in a direct line to the mouth of Dry or Beaver Creek below Stagner’s on\n\nWind River.” Council Minutes, at 9. Rev. Sherman Coolidge of the Arapaho\n\nadded he was glad McLaughlin had come “to purchase a portion of our\n\nreservation. The proposed ceded portion has not been used except for\n\ngrazing. . . . We need the money that we will get from the sale of these lands for\n\nimprovements on the unceded portion.” Council Minutes, at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -30-\n\f      The Tribes and McLaughlin entered into an agreement, see Council\n\nMinutes, at 27, and McLaughlin reported the progress back to Washington.\n\nSpecifically, he wrote,\n\n             The diminished reservation leaves the Indians the most\n             desirable and valuable portion of the Wind River\n             Reservation and the garden spot of that section of the\n             country. It is bounded on the north by the Big Wind\n             River, on the east and southeast by the Big Popo-Agie\n             River, which, being never failing streams carrying a\n             considerable volume of water, give natural boundaries\n             with well-defined lines; and the diminished reservation,\n             approximately 808,500 acres . . . allows 490 acres for each\n             of the 1,650 Indians now belonging to the reservation. I\n             have given this question a great deal of thought and\n             considered every phase of it very carefully and became\n             convinced that the reservation boundary, as stipulated in\n             the agreement, was ample for the needs of the\n             Indians . . . .\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, at 17 (1905) (emphasis added). But the 1904 Mondell\n\nBill as negotiated with the Tribes was never approved. Instead, it was amended\n\nand codified as a new bill (the 1905 Act), which was approved by Congress on\n\nMarch 3, 1905. The legislative history reveals almost no debate about the cession\n\nand payment provisions of the 1905 Act; as discussed, most of the debate had\n\noccurred in the drafting of the 1904 Act. According to the House Report on the\n\nissue, the 1905 Act was “in harmony” with the Mondell Bill, with “the principal\n\nchanges . . . in form rather than substance.” H.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, at 6.\n\n      We believe the circumstances surrounding the 1905 Act most closely\n\nresemble those in Rosebud. In 1901, McLaughlin was dispatched to negotiate\n\n                                        -31-\n\fwith the Indians on the Rosebud Reservation to cede unalloted portions of their\n\nreservation. Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 590. They agreed to cede 416,000 acres for a\n\nsum of $1,040,000, but the agreement was not ratified because it “‘provided that\n\nthe Government should pay for the lands outright.’” Id. at 591 (citation omitted).\n\nThe Supreme Court observed it was “undisputed” that had the agreement been\n\nratified, it would have changed the reservation’s boundaries. Id. Working from\n\nthat baseline, the Court concluded, “An examination of the legislative processes\n\nwhich resulted in the 1904 Act convinces us . . . that this purpose was carried\n\nforth and enacted.” Id. at 592.\n\n      Similarly, here, the unratified 1891 agreement with the Tribes served as a\n\npredicate for the 1905 Act. Indeed, in introducing the Mondell Bill,\n\nRepresentative Mondell had the 1891 agreement read into the record and then\n\noffered amendments to that agreement to reflect the revisions discussed. 38\n\nCong. Rec. 5,245, 5,245, 5,246–47 (1904). Thus, the actual congressional record\n\nbelies the EPA’s finding that no continuity of purpose existed between the 1891\n\nagreement and the 1905 Act. That provisions were revised to reflect the\n\nMcLaughlin negotiations and the prevailing policy on compensating Native\n\nAmericans for ceded land at the time is insufficient reason for severing and\n\nrendering irrelevant the circumstances prior to 1904.\n\n      Additionally, this case is unlike Solem, because the legislative history\n\nreveals that Congress explicitly stated its intent to cede portions of the\n\n                                         -32-\n\fReservation. Cf. Solem, 465 U.S. at 477 (Congress enacted a “sell and dispose”\n\nact). Moreover, the 1905 Act bears the same hallmarks that, as the Supreme\n\nCourt put it, made Solem a “more difficult” case and evidenced diminishment.\n\nCompare id. at 474 (explaining act permitted “Indians already holding allotments\n\non the opened lands to obtain new allotments . . . ‘within the respective\n\nreservations thus diminished’” (citation omitted)), with 33 Stat. at 1016 (“[A]nd\n\nany Indian who has made or received an allotment of land within the ceded\n\nterritory shall have the right to surrender such allotment and select other lands\n\nwithin the diminished reserve in lieu thereof . . . .”). ************** In the end,\n\n\n       **************\n                   Of course, Congress’s inclusion or removal of certain\nprovisions in the 1905 Act may cut against—but not defeat—a finding of\ndiminishment. For example, the Act included a provision that retained the lease\nrights of one Asmus Boysen and gave him the option to purchase preferential\nland. 33 Stat. at 1020. Boysen’s agreement with the Tribes contained a clause\nthat would have terminated the lease upon extinguishment of the Tribes’ title to\ncovered lands. JA 4604. The EPA’s decision opined that Congress’s concern\nwith the Boysen lease—particularly, its potential for clouding the title of certain\nopened lands—evinced an intent not to diminish the Reservation’s boundaries.\nJA 4606–07. The EPA’s understanding of Congress’s treatment of the Boysen\nlease was limited to a finding that “the 1905 Act would retain a Tribal trust\ninterest in the opened lands and that those lands would not be returned to the\npublic domain.” JA 4606. But as we explained in step one of our analysis, the\nexistence of a trust relationship is not determinative of diminishment, and, unlike\nHagen, this is not a “public domain” case. Additionally, the EPA pointed to\nCongress’s removal of a provision that would have required the United States to\npay the Tribes for sections 16 and 36 (as school lands) or equivalent lands of each\ntownship. JA 4608–09. The Supreme Court found the inclusion of such a\nprovision probative of diminishment in Rosebud and Yankton Sioux. See\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 599–601; Yankton Sioux, 522 U.S. at 349–50. But the\nrecord in this case reveals that Wyoming may have received federal land\nelsewhere in exchange, obviating the need for a school lands provision.\n\n                                            -33-\n\fCongress’s consistent attempts at the turn of the century to purchase the disputed\n\nland compel the conclusion that this intent continued through the passage of the\n\n1905 Act. And the statements in the legislative history about the diminishment of\n\nthe reservation, when taken together with the Act’s plain language, compel the\n\nconclusion Congress intended to diminish the Wind River Reservation by\n\nseparating the land north of the Big Wind River.\n\n      C. Subsequent Treatment of the Area\n\n      Third and finally, and “[t]o a lesser extent,” we can consider “Congress’s\n\nown treatment of the affected areas, particularly in the years immediately\n\nfollowing the opening,” as well as “the manner in which the Bureau of Indian\n\nAffairs and local judicial authorities dealt with unallotted open lands.” Solem,\n\n465 U.S. at 471. “[A]s one additional clue as to what Congress expected would\n\nhappen,” we also “look to the subsequent demographic history of opened lands.”\n\nId. at 471–72. But although such evidence can buttress a finding of diminishment\n\nbased on the statutory text, the Supreme Court “has never relied solely on this\n\nthird consideration.” Parker, 136 S. Ct. at 1081. Accordingly, subsequent events\n\n“‘cannot undermine substantial and compelling evidence from an Act and events\n\nsurrounding its passage.’” Osage Nation, 597 F.3d at 1122 (quoting Yazzie, 909\n\nF.2d at 1396). Our review of the subsequent treatment of the area is therefore\n\nbrief and ultimately does not impact our conclusion Congress intended to\n\ndiminish the Reservation by the 1905 Act.\n\n                                        -34-\n\f        From the outset, we note the parties have provided volumes of material\n\nevidencing the treatment of the ceded land after the 1905 Act. Unsurprisingly,\n\neach side has managed to uncover treatment by a host of actors supporting its\n\nrespective position. Recognizing this inevitability, the Supreme Court has warned\n\nthat at times “subsequent treatment” may be “so rife with contradictions and\n\ninconsistencies as to be of no help to either side.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 478.\n\nBecause we are unable to discern clear congressional intent from the subsequent\n\ntreatment, we find it is of little evidentiary value. See also JA 4624 (the EPA\n\nconceding “Congressional and Executive Branch references to the opened area\n\nwere inconsistent”); JA 3636 (Solicitor indicating “[t]he evidence from the years\n\nimmediately after the 1905 Act indicates some inconsistent treatment of the 1905\n\narea”). ***************\n\n        Nonetheless, we examine some of the more germane evidence. Perhaps the\n\nmost telling indication that Congress intended to diminish the Reservation’s\n\nboundaries in the 1905 Act is the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 984 (1934),\n\nin which Congress began implementing its new policy of Indian self-\n\ndetermination. But because the Tribes opted out of the Reorganization Act that\n\nwould have restored the ceded lands, in 1939, Congress authorized the restoration\n\n\n        ***************\n                     We agree with Judge Lucero that the Solem third step tells us\nlittle of value, and in fact “irrationally” requires us to infer intent from\nsubsequent demographic developments. The better guide is statutory text and the\nhistorical context that drove Congressional action.\n\n                                        -35-\n\fof “all undisposed-of surplus or ceded lands . . . which [we]re not at present under\n\nlease or permit to non-Indians,” and restored to tribal ownership the “balance of\n\nsaid lands progressively as and when the non-Indians owned the lands.” 53 Stat.\n\n1128, 1129–30 (1939). In administering the land restoration, the Secretary of the\n\nInterior sought to “add” the restored lands to, or “make them part of,” the\n\nReservation. For example, in one order, the Secretary stated,\n\n             Now, Therefore, by the virtue of authority vested in the\n             Secretary of the Interior by section 5 of the Act of July 27,\n             1939 (53 Stat. 1128-1130), I hereby find that the\n             restoration to tribal ownership of the lands described\n             above, which are classified as undisposed of, ceded lands\n             of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming, . . . will be in\n             the tribal interest, and they are hereby restored to tribal\n             ownership for the use and benefit of the Shoshone-\n             Arapahoe Tribes of Indians of the Wind River Reservation,\n             Wyoming, and are added to and made part of the existing\n             Wind River Reservation . . . .\n\n9 Fed. Reg. 9,754 (1944) (emphasis added). It is difficult to conceive why the\n\nSecretary would have used such language if indeed the ceded lands at all relevant\n\ntimes remained part of the Reservation.\n\n      Subsequent statements made by Congress also indicate Congress believed\n\nthe 1905 Act changed the Reservation’s boundaries. In 1907, Congress extended\n\nthe time for entry onto the ceded territory. In that Act, Congress referred to the\n\nland as “lands formerly embraced in the Wind River of Shoshone Indian\n\nReservation, in Wyoming, which were opened for entry.” 34 Stat. 849 (1907)\n\n(emphasis added); see also H.R. Doc. No. 64-1757, at 9 (1916) (stating “the\n\n                                          -36-\n\f[irrigation] project under consideration is within the ‘ceded lands’ portion of what\n\nwas formerly included in the Wind River or Shoshone Indian Reservation”\n\n(emphasis added)). Again, Congress’s consistent reference to lands that were\n\nformerly part of the Reservation is probative of diminishment.\n\n      Likewise, some maps from the period indicate the Reservation only\n\nincluded the unopened lands. See JA 3638 (explaining 1907 map by the State of\n\nWyoming and 1912 map by the General Land Office purported to show the\n\nReservation’s boundaries only encompassed lands unopened by the 1905 Act).\n\nBut, as the solicitor pointed out in her 2011 opinion, other maps merely reference\n\nthe ceded lands as “open lands.” Id. Ultimately, we agree with the solicitor that\n\n“[t]hese references are ambiguous and inconsistent at best.” Id.\n\n      We also briefly consider the subsequent demographics of the ceded area,\n\nthough this consideration is the least probative of congressional intent. Solem,\n\n465 U.S. at 471–72. As we have previously stated, “‘subsequent events and\n\ndemographic history can support and confirm other evidence but cannot stand on\n\ntheir own; by the same token they cannot undermine substantial and compelling\n\nevidence from an Act and events surrounding its passage.’” Osage Nation, 597\n\nF.3d at 1122 (quoting Yazzie, 909 F.2d at 1396). Here, the demographic history is\n\nmixed. On the one hand, only a small portion of the ceded land was ultimately\n\nsold to non-Indians because of disinterest in the area. See JA 3638. On the other\n\nhand, as the Wyoming Supreme Court has noted, roughly ninety-two percent of\n\n                                        -37-\n\fthe population of Riverton—the largest township on the ceded land—is non-\n\nIndian. Yellowbear, 174 P.3d at 1283. These mixed demographics do not\n\nestablish that “non-Indian settlers flooded into the opened portion,” causing the\n\narea to “los[e] its Indian character,” Solem, 465 U.S. at 471–72; by the same\n\ntoken, they do not undermine our conclusion that the statutory language and\n\nhistorical context of the 1905 Act compel a finding of diminishment.\n\n      Finally, jurisdictional and judicial treatment of the area is also mixed and\n\nthus has little probative value. Wyoming has previously exercised criminal\n\njurisdiction over parts of the disputed area. For example, in a 1960 opinion the\n\nWyoming Supreme Court found the state had jurisdiction over a crime that\n\noccurred north of Riverton in the ceded lands. Blackburn v. State 357 P.2d 174,\n\n179–80 (Wyo. 1960). Ten years later, the court held the state had jurisdiction\n\nover a murder committed in Riverton. State v. Moss, 471 P.2d 333, 339 (Wyo.\n\n1970). And in Yellowbear, the court applied the Solem factors and concluded\n\n“that it was the intent of Congress in passing the 1905 Act to diminish the Wind\n\nRiver Indian Reservation.” 174 P.3d at 1284. The court thus determined the state\n\nhad jurisdiction to prosecute Yellowbear. Id. Upon habeas review, we declined\n\nto disturb that decision. Yellowbear, 380 F. App’x at 743.\n\n      On the other hand, both Wyoming and several federal agencies have\n\nexercised civil jurisdiction over the disputed area. Aple. EPA Br. 65–66. And in\n\ndeciding Dry Creek Lodge, Inc. v. Arapahoe & Shoshone Tribes, we summarily\n\n                                        -38-\n\freferred to the town of Riverton as being within the boundaries of the\n\nReservation. 623 F.2d 682, 683 (10th Cir. 1980) (“Plaintiffs’ land is within the\n\nexterior boundaries of the Wind River Reservation of the Shoshone and Arapahoe\n\nIndians in Wyoming.”). But as the EPA acknowledged in its decision below, Dry\n\nCreek is “generally unrevealing regarding the legal effect of the 1905 Act,” given\n\nthat we did not consider the 1905 Act in light of the Solem criteria. JA 4645.\n\n       Adding to the varied treatment is the Wyoming Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin In re General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Big Horn River\n\nSystem (Big Horn I), 753 P.2d 76 (Wyo. 1988), aff’d sub nom. Wyoming v. United\n\nStates, 492 U.S. 406 (1989), overruled in part by Vaughn v. State, 962 P.2d 149\n\n(Wyo. 1998). But Big Horn I actually tells us little about how courts have treated\n\nthe Wind River Reservation. Contrary to the Tribes’ assertion, the court in Big\n\nHorn I did not interpret the 1905 Act as maintaining a larger Reservation.\n\nInstead, the court merely held the 1905 Act did not evince a clear intent to\n\nabrogate the water rights granted to the entire Wind River Reservation at its\n\ncreation in 1868. Big Horn I, 753 P.2d at 93–94. The court never stated that its\n\nallocation of water rights was based upon the Reservation boundaries, nor did it\n\nmake a specific finding about those boundaries.\n\n      Nevertheless, the Northern Arapaho argue Big Horn I bars Wyoming from\n\nchallenging the EPA’s boundary determination on res judicata grounds. But, as\n\ndetailed above, Big Horn I concerned the allocation of water rights, specifically\n\n                                        -39-\n\fthe priority dates for those rights. 753 P.2d at 83. The special master’s\n\nconclusion that the 1905 Act did not sever the 1868 priority date for water rights,\n\nsee id. at 92, is not determinative on the issue of diminishment—the issues are\n\nmutually exclusive, and Wyoming is not relitigating the water rights\n\ndetermination. Indeed, in dispensing of the issue, the Wyoming Supreme Court\n\nmerely stated, “A reservation of water with an 1868 priority date is not\n\ninconsistent with the permit provisions of the pre-Winters 1905 Act.” Id. at 93.\n\nEven more detrimental to the Northern Arapaho’s position, the Wyoming\n\nSupreme Court has since expressly rejected the Tribe’s characterization of Big\n\nHorn I. In Yellowbear, the court stated “while [the majority and the dissent]\n\ndisagreed over whether reserved water rights continued to exist in the ceded\n\nlands, the majority and dissent in Big Horn River agreed that the reservation had\n\nbeen diminished.” 174 P.3d at 1283 (emphasis added).\n\n      In sum, on balance the subsequent treatment of the ceded lands neither\n\nbolsters nor undermines our conclusion, based on steps one and two of the Solem\n\nframework, that the 1905 Act diminished the Wind River Reservation.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we find Congress diminished the boundaries of\n\nthe Wind River Reservation. We therefore GRANT Wyoming’s petition for\n\nreview, VACATE the EPA’s order, and REMAND for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        -40-\n\f14-9512 & 14-9514, Wyoming v. United States Environmental Protection Agency\nLUCERO, J., dissenting.\n\n       The “Indian right of occupancy of tribal lands, whether declared in a treaty or\n\notherwise created, has been stated to be sacred.” Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553,\n\n564 (1903). Our respect for this right stems, or should stem, from Tribes’ status as\n\n“separate sovereigns pre-existing the Constitution.” Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436\n\nU.S. 49, 56 (1978). Although Congress possesses the unilateral authority to diminish the\n\nreservations of these sovereign nations, Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463, 470 n.11 (1984)\n\n(citing Lone Wolf, 187 U.S. 553), we must not lightly assume that Congress has\n\nexercised this destabilizing power. Only when express statutory language, legislative\n\nhistory, and surrounding circumstances “point unmistakably to the conclusion that” a\n\nreservation was diminished should we read a statute as having that effect. DeCoteau v.\n\nDist. Cty. Ct. for Tenth Jud. Dist., 420 U.S. 425, 445 (1975).\n\n       In 1905, Congress passed an act transferring certain lands in the Wind River\n\nReservation to the United States. The federal government was to act as trustee by selling\n\nthe lands and paying the Indians the proceeds. Act of March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1016 (the\n\n“1905 Act” or the “Act”). From this placement of property into trust status in exchange\n\nfor a conditional promise of payment, my colleagues in the majority infer clear\n\ncongressional intent to diminish the Wind River Reservation. I cannot agree. By\n\nderiving an intent to diminish absent sum-certain payment or statutory language restoring\n\nlands to the public domain, the majority opinion creates a new low-water mark in\n\ndiminishment jurisprudence. Applying the three-step analysis from Solem, 465 U.S. at\n\f470-71, I would hold that the 1905 Act did not diminish Reservation boundaries.\n\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                               I\n\n       Our diminishment analysis begins with the statutory text. The Court has stated\n\nthat “language evidencing the present and total surrender of all tribal interests,” when\n\ncoupled with an “unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate the Indian\n\ntribe for its opened land,” creates a presumption of diminishment. Solem, 465 U.S. at\n\n470-71; see also DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 445-49 (finding diminishment based on language\n\nof cession and sum-certain payment). The 1905 Act states that the Indians “cede, grant,\n\nand relinquish to the United States, all right, title, and interest” to certain lands “within\n\nthe said reservation.” 33 Stat. at 1016. But the United States did not agree to pay a sum\n\ncertain. Instead, the Act provides that “the United States shall act as trustee for said\n\nIndians to dispose of said lands and to expend for said Indians and pay over to them the\n\nproceeds received from the sale thereof only as received, as herein provided.” Id. at 1021\n\n(emphasis added). Moreover, the Act states that “nothing in this agreement contained\n\nshall in any manner bind the United States to purchase any portion of the lands herein\n\ndescribed or to dispose of said lands except as provided herein, or to guarantee to find\n\npurchasers for said lands.” Id. at 1020. Citing the Act’s designation of a portion of the\n\nsale proceeds for per capita payments, the majority adopts the euphemism “hybrid\n\npayment scheme.” (Majority Op. 20.) However, the terms of the statute unambiguously\n\nreflect a conditional promise to pay.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Because the 1905 Act lacked sum-certain payment, the majority opinion’s reliance\n\non sum-certain cases is misplaced. It repeatedly asserts that the language of the 1905\n\nAct, like the statutory language in DeCoteau, is “precisely suited” to diminishment. (See,\n\ne.g., Majority Op. 14 (citing DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 445).) But when the Court in\n\nDeCoteau made that observation, it was comparing the statutory language of an 1889\n\nagreement to “that used in the other sum-certain, cession agreements” ratified in the same\n\nact. 420 U.S. at 446 (emphasis added). The DeCoteau Court distinguished both Seymour\n\nv. Superintendent, 368 U.S. 351 (1962), and Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481 (1973), in\n\npart, on the ground that the acts at issue in those cases conditioned payment to the tribes\n\non the “uncertain future proceeds of settler purchases”—precisely the situation presented\n\nhere. DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 448. In contrast, the 1891 act in DeCoteau “appropriate[d]\n\nand vest[ed] in the tribe a sum certain.” Id.\n\n       The 1905 Act differs from legislation deemed to have diminished reservations in\n\nanother important respect: It did not restore the lands at issue to the public domain. Cf.\n\nid. at 446 (citing legislators’ statements that “ratified agreements would return the ceded\n\nlands to the ‘public domain’” to support claim that agreements unquestionably\n\ndiminished reservations). Because the lands at issue here were held in trust under the\n\nAct, they remained Indian lands. In Ash Sheep Co. v. United States, 252 U.S. 159\n\n(1920), the Tribe “ceded, granted, and relinquished to the United States all of their right,\n\ntitle and interest.” Id. at 164 (quotations omitted). However, the government did not\n\nprovide unconditional payment, promising only to give the Indians the future proceeds of\n\nany land sales. Id. at 164-65. And, in language nearly identical to the 1905 Act, the\n\n                                                3\n\fstatute stated that the United States was not bound to purchase or sell the affected lands\n\nbut rather to “act as trustee” in their disposal. Id. at 165-66. The Court determined,\n\nbased on this language, that although the Indians had “released their possessory right to\n\nthe government,” the lands remained “Indian lands” because any benefits derived\n\ntherefrom would belong to the Indians as beneficiaries and not the government as trustee\n\nuntil the lands were sold. Id. at 166.1\n\n       Admittedly, the retention of a beneficial interest is not dispositive of reservation\n\nstatus. See Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584, 601 n.24 (1977). But the\n\nmajority too easily dismisses the trust status of the lands at issue. (See Majority Op. at\n\n22-23.) “The notion that reservation status of Indian lands might not be coextensive with\n\ntribal ownership was unfamiliar at the turn of the century.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 468.\n\nAccordingly, although it is not determinative, Congress’ decision not to restore these\n\nlands to the public domain cuts strongly against the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nReservation was diminished.\n\n       Given the absence of sum-certain payment or restoration of lands to the public\n\ndomain, we could easily interpret the language of cession contained in the 1905 Act as\n\nmerely opening portions of the Wind River Reservation to settlement.2 In assessing\n\n\n       1\n        The majority states that Ash Sheep is seldom cited in more recent diminishment\ncases because it addresses the different issue of whether lands became “public lands.”\n(Majority Op. 22.) But in DeCoteau, a case upon which the majority relies, the Court\ncites Ash Sheep in distinguishing Mattz based on the absence of sum-certain payment.\nSee DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 448.\n       2\n        As in Solem, the 1905 Act provides that Indians who held an allotment within\nthe opened territory would be permitted to obtain a new allotment in the unopened area,\n                                              4\n\fstatutory language nearly identical to the 1905 Act, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the\n\nDevils Lake Indian Reservation had not been diminished. United States v. Grey Bear,\n\n828 F.2d 1286 (8th Cir.), vacated in part on other grounds on reh’g en banc, 836 F.2d\n\n1088 (8th Cir. 1987). Specifically, the court held that although the language “do hereby\n\ncede, surrender, grant, and convey to the United States all their claim, right, title, and\n\ninterest” was suggestive of diminishment, id. at 1290 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Act of\n\nApril 27, 1904, ch. 1620, 33 Stat. 321-22), it did not “evince a clear congressional intent\n\nto disestablish the Devils Lake Reservation” absent an “unconditional commitment” by\n\nCongress to pay for the ceded lands, id.\n\n       The majority attempts to distinguish Grey Bear, noting that the legislative history\n\nof the act at issue there was not extensive and that subsequent treatment of the area\n\nweighed against a finding of diminishment. (Majority Op. 17 n.6.) But the majority\n\nclaims that the statutory text “strongly suggests that Congress intended to diminish the\n\nboundaries of the Wind River Reservation” and that the lack of sum certain payment does\n\n“not compel a different conclusion.” (Id. at 23.) The majority thus reaches a conclusion\n\nsquarely opposite to one of our sibling circuits, creating a needless circuit split.\n\n\n\nreferring to the latter as the “diminished reserve.” 33 Stat. at 1016; Solem, 465 U.S. at\n474 (describing unopened areas as “reservations thus diminished”). But the Supreme\nCourt explained that this phrase “cannot carry the burden of establishing an express\ncongressional purpose to diminish” because at the time of the Act, “‘diminished’ was not\nyet a term of art in Indian law.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 475 & n.17. Thus, Congress “may\nwell have been referring to diminishment in common lands and not diminishment of\nreservation boundaries.” Id. Similarly, references to a reservation “in the past tense”\nshould not “be read as a clear indication of congressional purpose to terminate.” Mattz,\n412 U.S. at 498-99.\n                                               5\n\f        The Supreme Court has counseled that “[w]hen we are faced with . . . two\n\npossible constructions, our choice between them must be dictated by a principle deeply\n\nrooted in this Court’s Indian jurisprudence: Statutes are to be construed liberally in favor\n\nof the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.” Cty. of Yakima v.\n\nConfederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation, 502 U.S. 251, 269 (1992)\n\n(quotation and alteration omitted). Adhering to that principle in this case, we must read\n\nthe 1905 Act as providing for sale and opening of lands rather than diminishment.\n\n                                               II\n\n       In very limited circumstances, courts have been willing to find diminishment even\n\nabsent “explicit language of cession and unconditional compensation.” Solem, 465 U.S.\n\nat 471. But that is true only if surrounding circumstances “unequivocally reveal a\n\nwidely-held, contemporaneous understanding that the affected reservation would shrink\n\nas a result of the proposed legislation.” Id. A “few phrases scattered through the\n\nlegislative history” are insufficient to manufacture clear congressional intent to diminish\n\nif a plain statement of that objective is lacking in the statutory text. Id. at 478.\n\n       Legislative history surrounding two ancillary portions of the 1905 Act counsel\n\nagainst an intent to diminish. First, Congress chose to omit a school lands provision from\n\nthe 1905 Act, demonstrating its view that the opened lands retained their Reservation\n\nstatus. A precursor bill, presented to Congress in 1904, initially provided that the United\n\nStates would pay $1.25 per acre for sections 16 and 36, or equivalent lands, in the opened\n\ntownships. 38 Cong. Rec. H5247 (1904). This provision mirrored the Wyoming\n\nEnabling Act, which grants sections 16 and 36 of each township to the state for school\n\n                                               6\n\fpurposes unless those lands are sold or disposed of, in which case the state may take\n\nother lands in lieu. Wyoming Enabling Act, ch. 664, § 4, 26 Stat. 222, 222-23 (1890).\n\nDuring debate on the 1904 bill, Representative Mondell proposed to strike the school\n\nlands provision. 38 Cong. Rec. H5247. He explained that although “the bill originally\n\nprovided that the State should take lands on the reservation” for the price of $1.25 per\n\nacre, eliminating the school lands provision would “leav[e] the State authorized under the\n\nenabling act to take lieu lands.” Id. (statement of Rep. Mondell) (emphasis added). Both\n\nMondell’s statement and the decision to omit the provision evince the belief that sections\n\n16 and 36 would remain part of the Reservation. The House Committee on Indian\n\nAffairs later reported that it had adhered to this policy in drafting the bill that would\n\nultimately become the 1905 Act. See H.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, pt. 1, at 7 (1905) (stating\n\nthat it had been “deemed wise by the committee to adhere to the policy laid down in the\n\nformer bill and agreement,” under which there was no school lands provision and\n\n“Indians [were] to receive the same rates from settlers for sections 16 and 36 as paid for\n\nother lands”).3\n\n       Conversely, if a school lands provision is included in a statute, the Supreme Court\n\nhas been more apt to find congressional intent to diminish. In Rosebud, for example, the\n\n\n       3\n         Although the Wyoming Enabling Act did not exempt reservations from the grant\nof sections 16 and 36 to the state for school purposes, the Wyoming Constitution\ndisclaims “all right and title to . . . all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any\nIndian or Indian tribes.” Wyo. Const. art. XXI, § 26. Because “Congress is presumed to\nact with knowledge of controlling constitutional limitations” when it enacts new statutes,\nGolan v. Gonzales, 501 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir. 2007), the decision to omit the school\nlands provision is further evidence Congress believed the opened lands to retain their\nreservation status.\n                                               7\n\fCourt held that the inclusion of a similar school lands provision evinced “congressional\n\nintent to disestablish Gregory County from the Rosebud Reservation, thereby making the\n\nsections available for disposition to the State of South Dakota for school sections.” 430\n\nU.S. at 601 (quotation omitted); see also South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S.\n\n329, 349-50 (1998) (inclusion of school lands provision indicative of intent to diminish).4\n\nThe majority notes that the State of Wyoming may have received federal land elsewhere\n\nas a result of Congress’ decision to omit the school lands provision. (Majority Op. 33\n\nn.13.) But that is exactly the point. By striking the provision, Congress recognized that\n\nWyoming could take lieu lands elsewhere, rather than pay $1.25 for “lands on the\n\nreservation.” 38 Cong. Rec. H5247 (statement of Rep. Mondell) (emphasis added); see\n\nalso 26 Stat. at 222-23.\n\n       Also weighing against a finding of diminishment is a provision granting Asmus\n\nBoysen a preferential right to lease new lands “in said reservation” in lieu of his existing\n\nlease rights. 33 Stat. at 1020. The provision was opposed by a minority in the House of\n\nRepresentatives, who argued that Boysen should not be granted preferential rights\n\nbecause his lease would terminate upon passage of the Act, and because “other persons\n\ndesiring to enter and settle upon the lands to be opened” should stand on equal footing.\n\n       4\n        In contrast to the Wyoming Enabling Act, the statute admitting North and South\nDakota into the Union expressly provided that sections 16 and 36 “embraced in\npermanent reservations” would not “be subject to the grants . . . of [the] act.” Act of\nFebruary 22, 1889, 25 Stat. 676, 679. However, as discussed in n.3, supra, the Wyoming\nConstitution served a similar function by disclaiming “all right and title” to lands held by\nIndian Tribes. Wyo. Const. art XXI, § 26. Accordingly, even if the grant of sections 16\nand 36 on the Wind River Reservation was not expressly prohibited by the Wyoming\nEnabling Act, it makes sense that Congress would not have provided for Wyoming to\ntake lands to which the state had “forever disclaim[ed] all right and title.” Id.\n                                              8\n\fH.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, pt. 2, at 2, 3 (emphasis added). By describing the “lands to be\n\nopened” as being “in said reservation,” 33 Stat. at 1020, the 1905 Act demonstrates\n\nCongress’ understanding that the opened areas would retain their reservation status.5\n\n       The majority relies on a prior history of negotiations to conclude that the 1905 Act\n\nresulted in diminishment, citing Rosebud for the proposition that implied continuity in\n\npurpose from a prior agreement is informative. (See Majority Op. 31-32 (citing Rosebud,\n\n430 U.S. at 590-92); see also id. at 15 n.2.) But the negotiation history presented here\n\ndiffers markedly from that considered by the Court in Rosebud. In Rosebud, the Rosebud\n\nSioux Tribe reached an agreement with the United States to diminish reservation\n\nboundaries in 1901. 430 U.S. at 587. Although Congress failed to ratify the agreement,\n\nthe Court concluded that the agreement’s purpose was carried out in subsequent acts\n\npassed in 1904, 1907, and 1910. Id. at 587-88, 592.\n\n       There were several factors in Rosebud that are not present in this case. Notably, a\n\nmere three years passed between the 1901 agreement and the 1904 act in Rosebud. It\n\nshould be unsurprising that congressional intent remained static for such a brief period.\n\n       5\n          Although the trust status of lands is not dispositive of the diminishment issue, the\ninclusion of the Boysen provision is further evidence that the opened lands were placed in\ntrust for the benefit of the Tribes. Boysen had previously entered into a mineral lease\nwith the Tribes that included portions of the opened area. The terms of the lease\nprovided it would terminate “in the event of extinguishment . . . of the Indian title to the\nlands covered by” the agreement. As discussed, supra, a minority opposed to the\nprovision argued that there was no need to grant Boysen preferential rights to the opened\nlands because his existing lease rights would automatically terminate upon passage of the\n1905 Act. But as Representative Marshall, the chairman of the subcommittee that\nconsidered the Boysen provision, explained, Indian title would not be extinguished\nbecause “these lands are not restored to the public domain, but are simply transferred to\nthe Government of the United States as trustee for these Indians.” 39 Cong. Rec. H1945\n(1905) (statement of Rep. Marshall).\n                                              9\n\fHere, my colleagues rely extensively on a proposed agreement from 1891, nearly a\n\ngeneration prior to passage of the 1905 Act. (See Majority Op. 24-25, 32.)\n\n       Further, in Rosebud the reason Congress failed to ratify the prior agreement “was\n\nnot jurisdiction, title, or boundaries” but “simply put, money.” 430 U.S. at 591 n.10\n\n(quotation omitted). The 1904 act was essentially identical to the 1901 agreement other\n\nthan the form of payment. Id. at 594-97. In contrast, the government and Tribes in this\n\ncase were unable to reach an agreement as to the particular lands to be opened in either\n\n1891 or 1893. In 1891, certain members of Congress called for the opening of more\n\nlands than what was provided for in the proposed agreement. H.R. Doc. No. 52-70, at 7-\n\n8 (1892). And the Tribes rejected three separate counteroffers in 1893, indicating they\n\ndid not wish to sell the lands under discussion. H.R. Doc. No. 53-51 (1894). Thus,\n\nunlike the three-year delay in Rosebud from an agreement that went unratified because of\n\nconcerns over the manner of payment, we are presented with a fourteen-year halt\n\nfollowing negotiations that failed because the parties could not agree on material terms.\n\n       Not only did a significant period of time elapse between the 1891 negotiations and\n\nthe 1905 Act in this case, but any continuity of purpose was also disrupted by intervening\n\nagreements regarding cession of other portions of the Reservation. In 1896, for example,\n\nInspector McLaughlin successfully negotiated the Thermopolis Purchase Act, under\n\nwhich the Tribes ceded the Big Horn Hot Springs to the United States in exchange for a\n\nsum-certain payment of $60,000. Act of June 7, 1897, 30 Stat. 62, 93-94. At a council\n\nmeeting in 1922, McLaughlin expressly distinguished the agreements underlying the\n\n1897 and 1905 Acts, stating that they were “entirely distinct and separate” and that under\n\n                                            10\n\fthe 1905 Act, “the government simply acted as trustee for disposal of the land north of\n\nthe Big Wind River.”\n\n       The absence of a continuity of purpose to diminish the Reservation is further\n\nevidenced by the negotiations preceding passage of the 1905 Act. In his 1903\n\nnegotiations with the Rosebud Tribe, McLaughlin stated that he was there “to enter into\n\nan agreement which is similar to that of two years ago, except as to the manner of\n\npayment.” Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 593. In this case, McLaughlin did not tell the Tribes in\n\n1904 that he sought to reopen the 1891 or 1893 negotiations. And although the majority\n\nquotes McLaughlin’s use of the word “cede,” (Majority Op. 27), he used that term\n\ninterchangeably with the concept of “opening . . . certain portions of [the] reservation for\n\nsettlement by the whites.” Similarly, any references to a diminished reservation “may\n\nwell have been referring to diminishment in common lands and not diminishment of\n\nreservation boundaries.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 475 & n.17.\n\n       Looking to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the 1905 Act, it cannot be\n\nsaid that they “unequivocally reveal a widely-held, contemporaneous understanding that\n\nthe affected reservation would shrink as a result of the proposed legislation.” Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471 (emphasis added). At best, the historical record is mixed regarding Congress’\n\nintent. As such, it is insufficient to overcome ambiguity in the statutory text.\n\n                                             III\n\n       At the third step of the Solem analysis, we consider “[t]o a lesser extent . . . events\n\nthat occurred after the passage of a surplus land act to decipher Congress’s intentions.”\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fSolem, 465 U.S. at 471. But this third prong comes into play only at the margins.6 If “an\n\nact and its legislative history fail to provide substantial and compelling evidence of a\n\ncongressional intention to diminish Indian lands, we are bound by our traditional\n\nsolicitude for the Indian tribes to rule that diminishment did not take place and that the\n\nold reservation boundaries survived the opening.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 472.\n\n       Because the statutory text and legislative history in this case fail to provide\n\ncompelling evidence of congressional intent to diminish, we need not consider this third\n\nprong. Even if we did, however, I agree with the majority that the post-Act record is so\n\nmuddled it does not provide evidence of clear congressional intent. (Majority Op. 34-\n\n35.)7 But, as with the first two steps in the analysis, this lack of clarity must not be treated\n\n\n       6\n         Although I acknowledge that controlling precedent permits courts to consider\npost-enactment events, I feel compelled to remark on the irrational nature of such an\ninquiry. The demographic makeup of an area decades or more following passage of a\nstatute cannot possibly tell us anything about the thinking of a prior Congress. See Philip\nP. Frickey, A Common Law for Our Age of Colonialism: The Judicial Divestiture of\nIndian Tribal Authority Over Nonmembers, 109 Yale L.J. 1, 19 (1999) (noting “[t]he\nconceptual problem with this approach, of course, is that postenactment developments\nreveal nothing about original congressional intent, much less intent sufficiently clear to\nsatisfy the canon” requiring ambiguous statutes to be construed in favor of tribal\ninterests). The Court itself has apparently recognized the dubiousness of this analysis,\nreferring to “de facto” diminishment as a “necessary expedient.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 471,\n472 n.13.\n        The third step of the Solem analysis cannot be meaningfully described as a tool to\ndecipher congressional intent. Rather, it is a means of ignoring that intent. Courts should\nbe loath to abandon the proper tools of statutory interpretation in any context, but to do so\nwith respect to Indian law is particularly perverse given our canon of construction that\n“statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians.” Confederated Tribes &\nBands of Yakima Indian Nation, 502 U.S. at 269 (quotation and alteration omitted).\n       7\n         I also agree with the majority that this controversy has not been rendered moot\nand that the Wyoming Farm Bureau has standing. (See Majority Op. 10-11 n.1.)\n\n                                              12\n\fas a neutral element. Because we apply a “presumption that Congress did not intend to\n\ndiminish,” Solem, 465 U.S. at 481, proponents of diminishment must show that “non-\n\nIndian settlers flooded into the opened portion of a reservation and the area has long since\n\nlost its Indian character,” id. at 471. The appellants have not met this burden.\n\n       Land sales in the opened area were largely a failure. By 1915, less than 10% of\n\nthe land had been sold to non-Indians, prompting the Department of the Interior (“DOI”)\n\nto indefinitely postpone further sales. Less than 15% of the opened area was ultimately\n\ntransferred to non-Indians. Cf. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. at 339 (noting that\n\napproximately 90% of unallotted tracts were settled in that case); Rosebud, 430 U.S. at\n\n605 (same). The DOI continued to allot parcels in the opened lands to Tribal members,\n\nand in 1939, Congress restored tribal ownership over the unsold land. Act of July 27,\n\n1939, ch. 387, 53 Stat. 1128. Today, approximately 75% of the lands opened for\n\nsettlement by the 1905 Act is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the\n\nTribes and their members.\n\n       Despite the sometimes conflicting treatment of the area by non-Indian authorities,\n\n(see Majority Op. 35-40), there can be little doubt that most of the opened area retains its\n\nIndian character. Accordingly, we face no risk of upsetting “justifiable expectations,”\n\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 605, by construing the 1905 Act as maintaining Reservation\n\nboundaries.\n\n                                             IV\n\n       We consider in this case an Act that began with Inspector McLaughlin’s warning\n\nto the Tribes that “Congress had the right to legislate for the opening of Indian\n\n                                             13\n\freservations without consulting the Indians or obtaining their consent.” Recognizing that\n\nCongress possesses the nearly unfettered power to impose its will, leaving the Tribes “no\n\nchoice but to consent,” the Court has held that “any doubtful expressions in [legislation]\n\nshould be resolved in the Indians’ favor.” Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U.S. 620,\n\n631 (1970). This rule must be given “the broadest possible scope” in the diminishment\n\ncontext. DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 447. In interpreting the 1905 Act, we must bear in mind\n\nthe government’s “moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust, obligations to\n\nthe fulfillment of which the national honor has been committed.” United States v.\n\nJicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 176 (2011) (citation and quotations omitted).\n\nWith this heavy thumb on the scale, I would hold that the 1905 Act did not diminish the\n\nWind River Reservation. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f",

We find that it\n\ndid.\n\n       The Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes jointly inhabit the\n\nWind River Reservation. The State of Wyoming and the Wyoming Farm Bureau\n\nFederation challenge a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency granting\n\nthe Tribes’ application for joint authority to administer certain non-regulatory\n\nprograms under the Clean Air Act on the Reservation. As part of their application\n\nfor administrative authority, the Tribes were required to show they possess\n\njurisdiction over the relevant land. In their application, the Tribes described the\n\nboundaries of the Wind River Reservation and asserted that most of the land\n\nwithin the original 1868 boundaries fell within their jurisdiction.\n\n       Wyoming and others submitted comments to the EPA arguing the\n\nReservation had been diminished in 1905 by act of Congress, and that some land\n\ndescribed in the application was no longer within tribal jurisdiction. After\n\nreview, the EPA determined the Reservation had not been diminished in 1905 and\n\nthe Tribes retained jurisdiction over the land at issue. Because the EPA decided\n\nthe Tribes otherwise satisfied Clean Air Act program requirements, it granted\n\ntheir application.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f      Wyoming and the Farm Bureau appealed the EPA’s Reservation boundary\n\ndetermination. Regionally applicable final actions of the EPA are directly\n\nappealable to this court. Exercising jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1), we\n\ngrant the petition for review, vacate the EPA’s boundary determination, and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We find by its 1905\n\nlegislation, Congress evinced a clear intent to diminish the Reservation.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n      The history of federal Indian policy in the United States is marked by a\n\nseries of eras, each characterized by a different approach to the inevitable conflict\n\nbetween the Native Americans who inhabited western America and homesteaders\n\nflooding west in search of a better life. Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law\n\n7–8 (Nell Jessup Newton et al. eds., 2012). The story of the Wind River\n\nReservation begins in the second half of the nineteenth century, when a new\n\nfederal policy of allotment and assimilation began to take shape, which followed\n\na period when Indian reservations were created throughout the western United\n\nStates. Unsurprisingly, westward expansion placed pressures on the traditional\n\nlifestyles of the Native American tribes. Recognizing the potential for conflicts,\n\nparticularly over land, the United States negotiated a series of treaties and\n\nagreements with dozens of tribes, including the Eastern Shoshone.\n\n      The Eastern Shoshone are part of the larger Shoshone Tribe, who in the\n\nmid-nineteenth century inhabited what would become the states of Colorado,\n\n                                         -5-\n\fIdaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. Henry Stamm, People of the Wind River 9\n\n(1999). In 1863, the United States and the Eastern Shoshone entered into the\n\nFirst Treaty of Fort Bridger, 18 Stat. 685 (1863), which established “Shoshonee\n\nCounty,” an area encompassing more than forty-four million acres. See United\n\nStates v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians of Wind River Reservation of Wyo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103014\"><a href=\"/opinion/103014/united-states-v-shoshone-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (1938). But the treaty proved to be short lived. With the end of the\n\nCivil War, a new wave of settlers forged westward. Fearing the Eastern\n\nShoshone’s homeland would be settled and thus lost forever, the tribal leader,\n\nChief Washakie, urged the United States to reserve the Wind River Valley—the\n\nTribe’s historic buffalo hunting grounds—as the Eastern Shoshone’s permanent\n\nhomeland.\n\n      Chief Washakie’s efforts were successful: in 1868, the United States and\n\nthe Eastern Shoshone Tribe signed the Second Treaty of Fort Bridger, 15 Stat.\n\n673 (1868). This treaty set aside roughly three million acres for exclusive tribal\n\nuse. In exchange, the Tribe relinquished its claim to the land held under the 1863\n\ntreaty. Shoshone, 304 U.S. at 113. As it had promised, the United States\n\ndeveloped the Reservation’s infrastructure and began to establish and expand\n\nagricultural lands in an effort to aid the Eastern Shoshone’s transition away from\n\nhunting wild game, which was rapidly disappearing. For their part, the Eastern\n\nShoshone resolved to settle permanently on the Reservation, pursue an agrarian\n\nlifestyle, and send their children to school.

At the time,\n\nCongress, and indeed most of America, assumed the reservation system would\n\neventually cease to exist and members of Native American tribes would become\n\nfully assimilated into American society. See Solem v. Bartlett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111106\"><a href=\"/opinion/111106/solem-v-bartlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468\n\n(1984); Marta Adams et al., American Indian Law Deskbook 93 (2015). Thus,\n\nreservations began to shrink in size. In 1874, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe sold all\n\nof its land south of the forty-third parallel in the so-called Lander Purchase in\n\nexchange for a payment of $25,000. 18 Stat. 291, 292 (1874). According to the\n\nratifying act, this transaction “change[d] the southern limit of said reservation.”\n\n18 Stat. at 292. Around this time, the Northern Arapaho—traditionally, an enemy\n\nof the Eastern Shoshone—joined the Eastern Shoshone on the Wind River\n\nReservation, where they remain today. 1877 Comm’r Indian Aff. Ann. Rep. 19.\n\n      The Wind River Reservation boundaries changed again in 1897, when\n\nCongress passed legislation purchasing additional land. That act, known as the\n\n                                          -7-\n\fThermopolis Purchase, provided that, in exchange for $60,000, the Tribes agreed\n\nto “cede, convey, transfer, relinquish, and surrender forever and absolutely all\n\ntheir right, title, and interest of every kind and character” in a tract around the Big\n\nHorn Hot Springs, located on the northern boundary of the Reservation. 30 Stat.\n\n93, 94 (1897). Following up on failed efforts to acquire additional land from the\n\nTribes in 1891 and 1893, in 1904 Representative Frank Mondell of Wyoming\n\nintroduced a bill initiating the cession of the land north of the Big Wind River\n\nflowing through the north-central portion of the Reservation. The 1904\n\nlegislation was the framework for negotiations with the Tribes, which the Tribes\n\nultimately agreed to as amended. Congress passed the 1904 agreement in 1905.\n\n33 Stat. 1016 (1905). It is the 1905 Act that is at issue in this case.\n\n       But the 1905 Act was not the last piece of legislation affecting the\n\nReservation. In 1934, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act, the first\n\nstep in its new national policy of tribal self-determination. See 48 Stat. 984\n\n(1934). Since the Tribes voted to exclude themselves from this Act, however,\n\nCongress had to pass specific legislation to carry out its new policies on the Wind\n\nRiver Reservation. Thus, in 1939, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior\n\nto restore to tribal ownership any unsold lands in the area that had been ceded in\n\n1905. 53 Stat. 1128, 1129 (1939).\n\n      That brings us to the present day. Currently, approximately seventy-five\n\npercent of the land affected by the 1905 Act is held in trust by the United States\n\n                                          -8-\n\ffor the Tribes and their members. In 2008, the Tribes applied to the EPA for\n\nauthority to manage certain non-regulatory programs for air quality in areas under\n\ntribal jurisdiction. They were able to do so because in 1990, Congress amended\n\nthe Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401–671 (CAA), to authorize the EPA to treat\n\nNative American tribes as states for the purposes of the CAA. § 7601(d).\n\nPursuant to this grant of authority, the EPA promulgated the Tribal Authority\n\nRule, 40 C.F.R. 49, under which qualified tribes may apply for authority to\n\nimplement and manage programs for air quality in areas under tribal jurisdiction.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 7601(d)(2)(B).\n\n      A successful application must describe the area over which a tribe seeks to\n\nassert its regulatory authority. Thus, in their application, the Tribes had to\n\nspecify the proposed scope of their regulatory jurisdiction, which required them\n\nto clearly delineate the boundaries of the Reservation. The Tribes claimed the\n\nboundaries of the Wind River Reservation were those set forth in the 1868 treaty,\n\nreduced only by the Lander and Thermopolis transactions. As required by the\n\nCAA, the EPA notified all governmental entities located contiguous to the\n\nReservation and provided local government and the general public notice and an\n\nopportunity to comment on the proposed boundary description. When a\n\ntreatment-as-a-state application is subject to an objection, EPA may also request\n\nadditional information or consult with the Department of the Interior. 40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 49.9(d).\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      In their comments, Wyoming and the Farm Bureau argued the Reservation\n\nwas diminished by the 1905 Act, which, they contended, established the current\n\nboundaries of the Reservation. Based on these objections, the EPA asked the\n\nDepartment of the Interior for an analysis of the competing claims. In 2011, the\n\nsolicitor issued a legal opinion concluding the 1905 Act had not changed the\n\nboundaries established by the 1868 treaty. Relying on this analysis, the EPA\n\nissued its final decision granting the Tribes’ application. The decision agreed\n\nwith the Tribes’ interpretation that the 1905 Act did not diminish the boundaries\n\nof the Reservation.\n\n                                   II.

To\n\ndetermine whether the 1905 Act had the effect of diminishing the Reservation, we\n\nlook to the well-settled approach described in Solem, where the Court outlined a\n\nhierarchical, three-step framework to ascertain congressional intent.\n\n      First, we look to the text of the statute, because it is “[t]he most probative\n\nevidence of congressional intent.” Id. at 470; see also Nebraska v. Parker, 136 S.\n\nCt. 1072, 1079 (2016) (“[W]e start with the statutory text, for ‘[t]he most\n\nprobative evidence of diminishment is, of course, the statutory language used to\n\nopen Indian lands.’” (citation omitted) (second alteration in original)).\n\n      Second, we examine the circumstances surrounding the passage of the act,\n\n“particularly the manner in which the transaction was negotiated with the tribes\n\ninvolved and the tenor of legislative reports presented to Congress.” Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471; see also Parker, 136 S.

Although examination\n\nof the historical record “involves a mixed question of law and fact,” de novo\n\nreview is appropriate “[w]here a mixed question ‘primarily involves the\n\nconsideration of legal principles.’” Id. at 1393–94 (quoting Supre v.

The EPA does not dispute this standard of\n\nreview, because it concedes a de novo standard is “consistent with the\n\n[Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘otherwise not in accordance with the law’\n\nstandard,” Aple. EPA Br. 23, which we apply to the agency action here.\n\n      A. The Text of the 1905 Act\n\n      We begin our analysis with the 1905 Act’s operative language, for\n\n“[s]tatutory language is the most probative evidence of congressional intent to\n\ndisestablish or diminish a reservation.” Osage Nation, 597 F.3d at 1122–23.\n\n“‘Explicit reference to cession or other language evidencing the present and total\n\nsurrender of all tribal interests strongly suggests that Congress meant to divest\n\nfrom the reservation all unallotted opened lands.’” Id. at 1123 (quoting Solem,\n\n465 U.S. at 470). There are no magic words of cession required to find\n\ndiminishment. Rather, the statutory language, whatever it may be, must\n\n“establis[h] an express congressional purpose to diminish.” Hagen v.

This language of cession aligns with the type\n\nof language the Supreme Court has called “precisely suited” to diminishment.\n\nYankton Sioux, 522 U.S. at 344. Indeed, it is nearly identical to the statutory\n\nlanguage in cases where the Supreme Court has found a congressional purpose to\n\ndiminish a reservation in the statute’s text.\n\n      For example, in DeCoteau v. District County Court for the Tenth Judicial\n\nDistrict, the Court considered an act providing that the Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribe\n\nagreed to “cede, sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States all their claim,\n\nright, title, and interest in and to all the unallotted lands within the limits of the\n\nreservation.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109206\"><a href=\"/opinion/109206/decoteau-v-district-county-court-for-tenth-judicial-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445 (1975).

Id. ***\n\n      Two decades later, in Hagen, the Court found Congress evinced a clear\n\nintent to diminish a reservation even when it employed less express language of\n\ncession. The operative language of the statute at issue provided that “all the\n\nunallotted lands within said reservation shall be restored to the public domain.”\n\n510 U.S. at 412. The Court held this language evidenced a congressional intent\n\n“inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status.” Id. at 414. **** And in\n\nYankton Sioux, the Court unanimously held Congress spoke with a clear purpose\n\nof diminishment when it passed an act providing that the Yankton Sioux Tribe\n\nwould “cede, sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States all their claim,\n\nright, title, and interest in and to all the unallotted lands within the limits of the\n\nreservation.” 522 U.S. at 344, 351.\n\n\n\n\n      ***\n          Although the 1907 and 1910 Acts in Rosebud merely authorized the\nSecretary of the Interior “to sell or dispose of” the unallotted portions, the court\nfound a “continuity of intent” from the earlier 1904 Act and a 1901 agreement,\nbased on the circumstances surrounding the passage of the later acts. Id. at\n606–13.\n      ****\n           Citing to Hagen, the EPA argues that when the operative language does\nnot restore ceded lands to the public domain, diminishment is less likely. We\ndisagree. While the Court in Hagen found language restoring lands to the public\ndomain probative of congressional intent to diminish a reservation, nowhere did it\nsuggest the absence of public domain language cuts against diminishment—\nespecially where, as here, the statute’s operative language includes even stronger\nlanguage of cession than in Hagen.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f      In contrast, in cases where the Court has found a lack of clear\n\ncongressional intent to diminish, the operative language of the statutes merely\n\nopened a reservation to settlement by non-Indians or authorized the Secretary of\n\nthe Interior to act as a “sales agent” for the Native American tribes. For example,\n\nin Seymour v. Superintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary, the Court concluded\n\nthat an act providing “for the sale of mineral lands and for the settlement and\n\nentry under the homestead laws of surplus lands remaining on the diminished\n\nColville Reservation after allotments were first made . . . did no more than open\n\nthe way for non-Indian settlers to own land on the reservation.” ***** </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106321\"><a href=\"/opinion/106321/seymour-v-superintendent-of-wash-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n354–56 (1962).

Nevertheless, the EPA and the Tribes argue that Congress’s\n\nintent remains unclear, because of the absence of words such as “sell” or\n\n“convey” that were present in other statutes during the period. But our task is not\n\nto divine why Congress may have chosen certain synonyms over others in this\n\nparticular Act. We believe Congress’s use of the words “cede, grant, and\n\nrelinquish” can only indicate one thing—a diminished reservation. A review of\n\nseveral dictionaries from the turn of the twentieth century confirms that adding\n\nthe words “sell” or “convey” would not materially change the intent Congress\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fevinced in the 1905 Act. ******** And in any event, Article II of the 1905 Act\n\nincludes the word “conveyed”:\n\n                 In consideration of the lands ceded, granted, relinquished,\n                 and conveyed by Article I of this agreement, the United\n                 States stipulates and agrees to dispose of the same, as\n                 hereinafter provided . . . .\n\n33 Stat. at 1019–20 (emphasis added). *********\n\n      ********\n               The absence of the words “convey” or “sell” in Article I tells us\nlittle about Congress’s intent, since the contemporaneous definitions of “cede,”\n“grant,” and “relinquish” were virtually indistinguishable from the definitions of\n“convey” and “sell.” For example, at the time, “cede” was defined as “[t]o yield\nor surrender, give up.” Webster’s Commonsense Dictionary 76 (J.T. Thompson\ned., 1902). Likewise, “grant” was defined as “[t]o allow, yield, concede; to\nbestow or confer, in answer to prayer or request; to make conveyance of, give the\npossession or title of.” Webster’s Practical Dictionary 165–66 (1906). And\n“relinquish” was defined as “[t]o give up the possession or occupancy of; to quit;\nto forsake; to abandon; to give up; to resign,” Webster’s Commonsense\nDictionary 405, or “[t]o withdraw from, leave behind; to give up, renounce a\nclaim to, resign, quit, forsake, abandon, forego,” Webster’s Practical Dictionary\n342.\n\n       By way of comparison, “convey” was defined as “to transfer to another,\nmake over,” id. 81, and “[t]o carry; to remove; to transmit,” Webster’s\nCommonsense Dictionary 105. “Sell” was defined as “[t]o give or deliver in\nexchange for some equivalent; to exchange for money,” id. 438, and “[t]o transfer\nto another for an equivalent; to dispose of in return for something, esp. for\nmoney,” Webster’s Practical Dictionary 361. It is true the word “sell” could add\nthe notion of an exchange for money, but the Supreme Court has found a statute’s\noperative language to be “precisely suited” to diminishment without the presence\nof the word “sell.” See Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 597.\n      *********\n               It is worth noting the Wyoming Supreme Court, applying Solem,\nheld the operative language of the 1905 Act evinced Congress’s clear intent to\ndiminish the Reservation.

The 1905 Act does not provide for a single, lump-sum payment, but\n\nrather outlines a hybrid payment scheme, under which different amounts derived\n\nfrom the proceeds of sales of the ceded lands are allocated to specific funds. For\n\nexample, the Act provides $150,000 for “the construction and extension of an\n\nirrigation system within the diminished reservation,” $50,000 for a school fund,\n\nand $50,000 for the purchase of livestock. 33 Stat. 1017–18. The Act also\n\ncreates a general welfare and improvement fund and appropriates $85,000 for per\n\ncapita payments of $50 each. 33 Stat. 1018, 1020–21. As we explain in more\n\ndetail below, it was thought this hybrid payment scheme would yield more\n\nrevenue to the tribes, since they would be paid from the proceeds collected from\n\nthe homesteaders.\n\n      In arguing this payment scheme is fatal to a finding of diminishment, the\n\nEPA and the Tribes rely on Solem. There the Court held language of cession\n\ncombined with a sum certain payment creates “an almost insurmountable\n\npresumption that Congress meant for the tribe’s reservation to be diminished.”\n\n\n      *********\n             (...continued)\nYellowbear’s federal habeas petition, we concluded Yellowbear failed to present\nany argument “calling into question the correctness of [the Wyoming Supreme\nCourt’s] decision.” Yellowbear v.

But this presumption is not a two-way street. In Hagen, the\n\nCourt expressly rejected the argument that a finding of diminishment requires\n\n“both explicit language of cession or other language evidencing the surrender of\n\ntribal interests and an unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate\n\nthe Indians.” 510 U.S. at 411 (emphasis added). The Court explained, “While the\n\nprovision for definite payment can certainly provide additional evidence of\n\ndiminishment, the lack of such a provision does not lead to the contrary\n\nconclusion.” Id. at 412. The Court continued, “In fact, the statutes at issue in\n\nRosebud, which we held to have effected a diminishment, did not provide for the\n\npayment of a sum certain to the Indians.” Id. And indeed, in Rosebud, the Court\n\nnoted a sum certain payment or lack thereof is only one of many textual indicators\n\nof congressional intent. 430 U.S. at 598 n.20. Congress’s decision to abandon\n\nthe sum certain method of payment was “not conclusive with respect to\n\ncongressional intent.” ********** Id. at 588. What matters most is not the\n\n\n\n      **********\n                The Court in Rosebud added that the act at issue was not\ncompletely devoid of a guaranteed payment. The Court observed, “[d]espite this\n‘uncertain sum’ proviso,” the act mandated that “all lands herein ceded and\nopened to settlement . . . remaining undisposed of at the expiration of four years\nfrom the taking effect of this Act, shall be sold and disposed of for cash . . . .”\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 596 n.18 (citation omitted). In the Court’s words, such\narrangement “suggests that Congress viewed this land as disestablished\nimmediately.” Id. Similarly, here, the 1905 Act requires “[t]hat any lands\nremaining unsold eight years after the said lands shall have been opened for entry\nmay be sold to the highest bidder for cash without regard to the above minimum\nlimit of price.” 33 Stat. at 1021.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fmechanism of payment, but rather the “language of immediate cession.” Id. at\n\n597.\n\n       Finally, the EPA and the Tribes argue the trusteeship language in the 1905\n\nAct demonstrates that Congress merely meant for the United States to hold the\n\nland in trust for the Tribes until it was sold. The EPA and the Tribes thus believe\n\nthe Act effected no change in ownership until parcels were sold to settlers. They\n\npoint to Article IX of the Act, which provides,\n\n             [N]othing in this agreement contained shall in any manner\n             bind the United States to purchase any portion of the lands\n             herein described or to dispose of said lands except as\n             provided herein, or to guarantee to find purchasers for said\n             lands or any portion thereof, it being the understanding\n             that United States shall act as trustee for said Indians to\n             dispose of said lands and to expend for said Indians and\n             pay over to them the proceeds received from the sale\n             thereof only as received, as herein provided.\n\n33 Stat. at 1020–21. In support of this argument, the EPA relies on similar\n\nlanguage the Court considered in Ash Sheep Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99538\"><a href=\"/opinion/99538/ash-sheep-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1920). There the Court held that the Crow Tribe retained a beneficial interest in\n\nceded lands that precluded them from becoming “public lands.” Id. at 166. But\n\nthe Court has since explained that the question considered in Ash Sheep—whether\n\nlands became “public lands”—is “logically separate” from diminishment. See\n\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 601 n.24. Accordingly, Ash Sheep is seldom mentioned in\n\nsubsequent cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f      In any event, the Court has made clear that trust status is not incongruous\n\nwith congressional intent to diminish a reservation. In Rosebud, for example, the\n\nCourt considered a series of statutes in which the United States did not promise to\n\nfind purchasers for the lands, but rather agreed to act as trustee for the Indians to\n\ndispose of the lands and collect and distribute the proceeds. 430 U.S. at 596, 608.\n\nThe Court held congressional intent was to diminish the Rosebud Reservation,\n\nnotwithstanding the trusteeship provisions. See id. 430 U.S. at 615. The Court\n\nagreed with the Eighth Circuit that “‘the fact that a beneficial interest is retained\n\ndoes not erode the scope and effect of the cession made, or preserve to the\n\nreservation its original size, shape, and boundaries.’” Id. at 601 n.24 (quoting\n\nRosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"329482\"><a href=\"/opinion/329482/rosebud-sioux-tribe-appellant-plaintiff-v-honorable-richard-kneip/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (8th Cir. 1975)). Even the\n\ndissent acknowledged, “[o]f course, it is possible that Congress intended to\n\nremove the opened counties from the Reservation while leaving the Indians with a\n\nhost of rights in the counties.” Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 622.\n\n      In sum, the express language of cession in the Act’s operative text, taken\n\ntogether with the Act’s other references to diminishment, strongly suggests that\n\nCongress intended to diminish the boundaries of the Wind River Reservation.\n\nThe lack of a sum certain payment and the inclusion of a trusteeship provision do\n\nnot compel a different conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f      B. The Historical Context of the Act\n\n      The contemporary historical context further confirms Congress intended to\n\ndiminish the Wind River Reservation when it passed the 1905 Act. Although we\n\nbelieve the statutory language points strongly towards diminishment, we also\n\nconsider “the manner in which the transaction was negotiated with the tribes\n\ninvolved and the tenor of legislative reports presented to Congress.” Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471; see also Yankton Sioux, 522 U.S. at 351. As the Supreme Court has\n\nstated, “[e]ven in the absence of a clear expression of congressional purpose in\n\nthe text of a surplus land Act, unequivocal evidence derived from the surrounding\n\ncircumstances may support the conclusion that a reservation has been\n\ndiminished.” Id. Of course, here we need not search for unequivocal evidence,\n\nfor the statute contains express language of cession. But our scrutiny of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the 1905 Act confirms that Congress intended to\n\ndiminish the Reservation’s boundaries.\n\n      The legislative history and the negotiations leading up to the 1905 Act\n\nreveal Congress’s longstanding desire to sever from the Wind River Reservation\n\nthe area north of the Big Wind River. As in Rosebud, “[a]n examination of the\n\nlegislative processes which resulted in the 190[5] Act convinces us . . . that this\n\npurpose was carried forth and enacted.” 430 U.S. at 592. “Because of the history\n\nof the . . . Agreement, the 190[5] Act cannot, and should not, be read as if it were\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fthe first time Congress had addressed itself to the diminution of the [Wind River]\n\nReservation.” See id.\n\n       In 1891, Congress drafted a bill that, had it passed, would have changed the\n\nReservation’s boundaries to exclude the land north of the Big Wind River. Under\n\nthe 1891 agreement, the Tribes were to “cede, convey, transfer, relinquish and\n\nsurrender, forever and absolutely . . . all [the Tribes’] right, title, and interest, of\n\nevery kind and character, in and to the lands, and the water rights appertaining\n\nthereunto” in exchange for the sum of $600,000. H.R. Exec. Doc. No. 52-70, at\n\n29, 30 (1892). Though Congress did not ratify this agreement, two years later the\n\nSecretary of the Interior sent another commission to negotiate with the Tribes for\n\nthe sale of the land north of the Big Wind River. This time, the United States\n\nasked for additional land and offered the Tribes $750,000. H.R. Exec. Doc. No.\n\n53-51, at 4 (1894). Despite the higher offer, the Tribes refused three different\n\nproposals, and no agreement was reached. ***********\n\n       Congressional activity resumed in 1904, when Representative Frank\n\nMondell of Wyoming introduced a bill to further reduce the Wind River\n\nReservation. The 1904 Mondell Bill was based on the 1891 and 1893 proposals.\n\nBut by 1904, the Supreme Court had declared that Congress had plenary authority\n\nover relations with Native Americans, so Congress no longer needed tribal\n\n\n       ***********\n               Congress did successfully obtain the land around the Big Horn\nHot Springs through the Thermopolis purchase in 1897. 30 Stat. at 94.\n\n                                           -25-\n\fapproval to change reservation boundaries. See Lone Wolf v.

As Representative Thomas Frank Marshall, the Chairman of the\n\nCommittee on Indian Affairs wrote, the 1904 Bill “propose[d] to reduce the\n\nreservation, as suggested . . . at the time of the making of the agreement of\n\n1891 . . . .” H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355, at 3 (1904).\n\n      The Mondell Bill, however, differed from the 1891 agreement in several\n\nrespects. One amendment—and one the EPA and the Tribes point to—was the\n\nelimination of the $600,000 sum certain payment. To that, Representative\n\nMarshall explained, “[The Mondell Bill] follows as closely as possible, under the\n\nchanged conditions and the present policy of Congress relative to payments for\n\nlands purchased from Indians, the agreement of 1891 and the bill prepared at the\n\ntime for carrying out the provisions of that agreement.” H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355,\n\nat 4 (emphasis added). “[The bill] follows the now established rule of the House\n\nof paying to the Indians the sums received from the ceded territory under the\n\nprovisions of the bill.” H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355, at 2; see also H.R. Rep. No. 58-\n\n2355, at 8 (quoting letter from then-Acting Commissioner to the Secretary of the\n\nInterior A. C. Tonner explaining structure of payment framework). Thus, to\n\ncomply with prevailing policy, the sum certain payment was excised and replaced\n\nwith a framework whereby lands would be sold at different times and at different\n\nprices with the proceeds to be transferred to the Tribes. And, incidentally,\n\nCongress believed that the Tribes could realize greater compensation under such a\n\n                                         -26-\n\fframework. H.R. Rep. No. 58-2355, at 4 (observing “[t]he amount which the\n\nIndians would receive at $1 an acre would be $1,480,000”). Such a payment\n\nscheme was the prevailing congressional policy at the time. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has explained, Congress adopted “‘a new policy in acquiring lands from the\n\nIndians [by] provid[ing] that the lands shall be disposed of to settlers . . ., and to\n\nbe paid for by the settlers, and the money to be paid to the Indians only as it is\n\nreceived . . . from the settlers.’” Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 592 (footnote omitted)\n\n(alterations in original).\n\n      Given these congressional directives, in April 1904, Indian Inspector James\n\nMcLaughlin met with the Tribes and presented the terms of the Mondell Bill in a\n\nseries of meetings on the Wind River Reservation. ************ McLaughlin opened\n\nby stating,\n\n              My friends, I am sent here at this time by the Secretary of\n              the Interior to present to you a proposition for the opening\n              of certain p[or]tions of your reservation for settlement by\n              the whites. It is believed that it will be to the best\n              interests of your two tribes to cede to the United States the\n              portions referred to.\n\n\n\n      ************\n                  McLaughlin, who had also negotiated the 1897 Thermopolis\nPurchase, negotiated many land agreements with Native American tribes,\nincluding the Lower Brules, the Otoes, the Missourias, the Klamaths, the Modocs,\nthe Yankton, the Sioux, the Red Lake Chippewas, the Mille Lacs Chippewas, the\nPah-Utes, and the Standing Rock Sioux. James McLaughlin, My Friend the\nIndian 295 (1910). The Supreme Court has reviewed agreements he negotiated\nthat resulted in diminishment in a number of cases, including Rosebud and Hagen.\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fMinutes of Council between James McLaughlin, U.S. Indian Inspector, and the\n\nIndians of the Eastern Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes, at 2 (Apr. 19–21, 1904)\n\n(emphasis added) (reproduced in JA 509–36) [Council Minutes]. But McLaughlin\n\nexplained that since his last agreement with the Tribes, Congress’s policy for\n\npaying for ceded land had changed: “For several years past there has been a\n\nsentiment in Congress . . . opposed to paying the Indians a lump sum\n\nconsideration for their lands. Instead of stipulating, or providing in the\n\nagreement, a lump sum consideration for any tract of land, they have determined\n\nupon giving the Indians the full benefit of the land by paying the Indians from the\n\nproceeds of the sale of the land as whitemen settle upon it.” Council Minutes, at\n\n3. McLaughlin explained to the Tribes that they would “receive more in the\n\naggregate than under the old lump sum agreements.” Council Minutes, at 4.\n\n      McLaughlin advised the Tribes during negotiations that the boundaries of\n\nthe Reservation would change as a result of the Act, just as they would have\n\nunder the agreement in 1891 and the negotiations in 1893. He stated,\n\n             I now wish to talk of the boundaries of the reservation and\n             the residue of land that will remain in your diminished\n             reservation. That being a very important matter. . . . The\n             tract to be ceded to the United States, as proposed by the\n             “Mondell Bill,” is estimated at 1,480,000 acres, leaving\n             800,500 acres in the diminished reservation.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fCouncil Minutes, at 6 (emphasis added). ************* McLaughlin informed the\n\nTribes that “a large reservation is not in your interest,” while the reduction would\n\nbe, and that Congress could now unilaterally change the boundaries of the\n\nReservation if the Tribes did not agree. Council Minutes, at 7.\n\n      Explaining the purpose of the Mondell Bill, McLaughlin told the Tribes\n\nthat this agreement would allow the Tribes to “dispos[e] of the lands that you do\n\nnot need” and that they would “realiz[e] money from the sale of that land, which\n\nwill provide you with means to make yourselves comfortable upon your\n\nreservation . . . .” Council Minutes, at 3. He also referred to the ceded lands as\n\n“the public domain” and made clear the land on the north side of the Big Wind\n\nRiver (part of the ceded territory), after the agreement, would be different:\n\n              Those of you who have allotments on the north side of the\n              river, if you so desire, can have them cancelled and come\n              within the diminished reservation. * * * However, any of\n              you who retain your allotments on the other side of the\n              river can do so, and you will have the same rights as the\n              whiteman, and can hold your lands or dispose of them, as\n              you see fit. On the reservation, you will be protected by\n\n      *************\n                   We acknowledge the Supreme Court stated in Solem that a “few\nscattered phrases” describing agreements as “reducing the reservation,” or “the\nreservation as diminished,” do not indicate a clear congressional purpose to\ndiminish the boundaries of a reservation. 465 U.S. at 478; see also id. at 475 n.17\n(reasoning “‘diminished’ was not yet a term of art in Indian law”). For as the\nCourt observed, “[I]t is unclear whether Congress was alluding to the reduction in\nIndian-owned lands that would occur once some of the opened lands were sold to\nsettlers or to the reduction that a complete cession of tribal interests in the opened\narea would precipitate.” Id. (citation omitted). But here we are not limited to a\nfew ambiguous phrases; rather, we are presented with a more complete set of\ncircumstances similar to those the Supreme Court credited in Rosebud.\n\n                                         -29-\n\f              the laws that govern reservations in all your rights and\n              privileges.\n\n              Furthermore, all of you who may retain your allotments off\n              the reservation, will not lose any of your rights on the\n              reservation, and you have rights the same as if you\n              remained within the diminished reservation. You will\n              have rights to surplus lands, the timber etc, although your\n              home may be on the public domain.\n\nCouncil Minutes, at 14 (emphasis added).\n\n       The tenor of the Tribes’ understanding of the agreement reflects that the\n\nReservation’s boundaries would be diminished. One representative for the\n\nEastern Shoshone told McLaughlin that his Tribe understood it was “parting with\n\n[its lands] forever and [could] never recover [them] again.” Council Minutes, at\n\n17. Long Bear, a chief of the Arapaho Tribe, proclaimed, “I understand what he\n\ncomes for . . . and I will tell what part of the Reservation I want to sell. . . . I\n\nwant to cede that portion of the reservation from the mouth of the Dry Muddy\n\nGulch in a direct line to the mouth of Dry or Beaver Creek below Stagner’s on\n\nWind River.” Council Minutes, at 9. Rev. Sherman Coolidge of the Arapaho\n\nadded he was glad McLaughlin had come “to purchase a portion of our\n\nreservation. The proposed ceded portion has not been used except for\n\ngrazing. . . . We need the money that we will get from the sale of these lands for\n\nimprovements on the unceded portion.” Council Minutes, at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -30-\n\f      The Tribes and McLaughlin entered into an agreement, see Council\n\nMinutes, at 27, and McLaughlin reported the progress back to Washington.\n\nSpecifically, he wrote,\n\n             The diminished reservation leaves the Indians the most\n             desirable and valuable portion of the Wind River\n             Reservation and the garden spot of that section of the\n             country. It is bounded on the north by the Big Wind\n             River, on the east and southeast by the Big Popo-Agie\n             River, which, being never failing streams carrying a\n             considerable volume of water, give natural boundaries\n             with well-defined lines; and the diminished reservation,\n             approximately 808,500 acres . . . allows 490 acres for each\n             of the 1,650 Indians now belonging to the reservation. I\n             have given this question a great deal of thought and\n             considered every phase of it very carefully and became\n             convinced that the reservation boundary, as stipulated in\n             the agreement, was ample for the needs of the\n             Indians . . . .\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, at 17 (1905) (emphasis added). But the 1904 Mondell\n\nBill as negotiated with the Tribes was never approved. Instead, it was amended\n\nand codified as a new bill (the 1905 Act), which was approved by Congress on\n\nMarch 3, 1905. The legislative history reveals almost no debate about the cession\n\nand payment provisions of the 1905 Act; as discussed, most of the debate had\n\noccurred in the drafting of the 1904 Act. According to the House Report on the\n\nissue, the 1905 Act was “in harmony” with the Mondell Bill, with “the principal\n\nchanges . . . in form rather than substance.” H.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, at 6.\n\n      We believe the circumstances surrounding the 1905 Act most closely\n\nresemble those in Rosebud. In 1901, McLaughlin was dispatched to negotiate\n\n                                        -31-\n\fwith the Indians on the Rosebud Reservation to cede unalloted portions of their\n\nreservation. Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 590. They agreed to cede 416,000 acres for a\n\nsum of $1,040,000, but the agreement was not ratified because it “‘provided that\n\nthe Government should pay for the lands outright.’” Id. at 591 (citation omitted).\n\nThe Supreme Court observed it was “undisputed” that had the agreement been\n\nratified, it would have changed the reservation’s boundaries. Id. Working from\n\nthat baseline, the Court concluded, “An examination of the legislative processes\n\nwhich resulted in the 1904 Act convinces us . . . that this purpose was carried\n\nforth and enacted.” Id. at 592.\n\n      Similarly, here, the unratified 1891 agreement with the Tribes served as a\n\npredicate for the 1905 Act. Indeed, in introducing the Mondell Bill,\n\nRepresentative Mondell had the 1891 agreement read into the record and then\n\noffered amendments to that agreement to reflect the revisions discussed. 38\n\nCong. Rec. 5,245, 5,245, 5,246–47 (1904). Thus, the actual congressional record\n\nbelies the EPA’s finding that no continuity of purpose existed between the 1891\n\nagreement and the 1905 Act. That provisions were revised to reflect the\n\nMcLaughlin negotiations and the prevailing policy on compensating Native\n\nAmericans for ceded land at the time is insufficient reason for severing and\n\nrendering irrelevant the circumstances prior to 1904.\n\n      Additionally, this case is unlike Solem, because the legislative history\n\nreveals that Congress explicitly stated its intent to cede portions of the\n\n                                         -32-\n\fReservation. Cf. Solem, 465 U.S. at 477 (Congress enacted a “sell and dispose”\n\nact). Moreover, the 1905 Act bears the same hallmarks that, as the Supreme\n\nCourt put it, made Solem a “more difficult” case and evidenced diminishment.\n\nCompare id. at 474 (explaining act permitted “Indians already holding allotments\n\non the opened lands to obtain new allotments . . . ‘within the respective\n\nreservations thus diminished’” (citation omitted)), with 33 Stat. at 1016 (“[A]nd\n\nany Indian who has made or received an allotment of land within the ceded\n\nterritory shall have the right to surrender such allotment and select other lands\n\nwithin the diminished reserve in lieu thereof . . . .”). ************** In the end,\n\n\n       **************\n                   Of course, Congress’s inclusion or removal of certain\nprovisions in the 1905 Act may cut against—but not defeat—a finding of\ndiminishment. For example, the Act included a provision that retained the lease\nrights of one Asmus Boysen and gave him the option to purchase preferential\nland. 33 Stat. at 1020. Boysen’s agreement with the Tribes contained a clause\nthat would have terminated the lease upon extinguishment of the Tribes’ title to\ncovered lands. JA 4604. The EPA’s decision opined that Congress’s concern\nwith the Boysen lease—particularly, its potential for clouding the title of certain\nopened lands—evinced an intent not to diminish the Reservation’s boundaries.\nJA 4606–07. The EPA’s understanding of Congress’s treatment of the Boysen\nlease was limited to a finding that “the 1905 Act would retain a Tribal trust\ninterest in the opened lands and that those lands would not be returned to the\npublic domain.” JA 4606. But as we explained in step one of our analysis, the\nexistence of a trust relationship is not determinative of diminishment, and, unlike\nHagen, this is not a “public domain” case. Additionally, the EPA pointed to\nCongress’s removal of a provision that would have required the United States to\npay the Tribes for sections 16 and 36 (as school lands) or equivalent lands of each\ntownship. JA 4608–09. The Supreme Court found the inclusion of such a\nprovision probative of diminishment in Rosebud and Yankton Sioux. See\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 599–601; Yankton Sioux, 522 U.S. at 349–50. But the\nrecord in this case reveals that Wyoming may have received federal land\nelsewhere in exchange, obviating the need for a school lands provision.\n\n                                            -33-\n\fCongress’s consistent attempts at the turn of the century to purchase the disputed\n\nland compel the conclusion that this intent continued through the passage of the\n\n1905 Act. And the statements in the legislative history about the diminishment of\n\nthe reservation, when taken together with the Act’s plain language, compel the\n\nconclusion Congress intended to diminish the Wind River Reservation by\n\nseparating the land north of the Big Wind River.\n\n      C. Subsequent Treatment of the Area\n\n      Third and finally, and “[t]o a lesser extent,” we can consider “Congress’s\n\nown treatment of the affected areas, particularly in the years immediately\n\nfollowing the opening,” as well as “the manner in which the Bureau of Indian\n\nAffairs and local judicial authorities dealt with unallotted open lands.” Solem,\n\n465 U.S. at 471. “[A]s one additional clue as to what Congress expected would\n\nhappen,” we also “look to the subsequent demographic history of opened lands.”\n\nId. at 471–72. But although such evidence can buttress a finding of diminishment\n\nbased on the statutory text, the Supreme Court “has never relied solely on this\n\nthird consideration.” Parker, 136 S. Ct. at 1081. Accordingly, subsequent events\n\n“‘cannot undermine substantial and compelling evidence from an Act and events\n\nsurrounding its passage.’” Osage Nation, 597 F.3d at 1122 (quoting Yazzie, 909\n\nF.2d at 1396). Our review of the subsequent treatment of the area is therefore\n\nbrief and ultimately does not impact our conclusion Congress intended to\n\ndiminish the Reservation by the 1905 Act.\n\n                                        -34-\n\f        From the outset, we note the parties have provided volumes of material\n\nevidencing the treatment of the ceded land after the 1905 Act. Unsurprisingly,\n\neach side has managed to uncover treatment by a host of actors supporting its\n\nrespective position. Recognizing this inevitability, the Supreme Court has warned\n\nthat at times “subsequent treatment” may be “so rife with contradictions and\n\ninconsistencies as to be of no help to either side.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 478.\n\nBecause we are unable to discern clear congressional intent from the subsequent\n\ntreatment, we find it is of little evidentiary value. See also JA 4624 (the EPA\n\nconceding “Congressional and Executive Branch references to the opened area\n\nwere inconsistent”); JA 3636 (Solicitor indicating “[t]he evidence from the years\n\nimmediately after the 1905 Act indicates some inconsistent treatment of the 1905\n\narea”). ***************\n\n        Nonetheless, we examine some of the more germane evidence. Perhaps the\n\nmost telling indication that Congress intended to diminish the Reservation’s\n\nboundaries in the 1905 Act is the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 984 (1934),\n\nin which Congress began implementing its new policy of Indian self-\n\ndetermination. But because the Tribes opted out of the Reorganization Act that\n\nwould have restored the ceded lands, in 1939, Congress authorized the restoration\n\n\n        ***************\n                     We agree with Judge Lucero that the Solem third step tells us\nlittle of value, and in fact “irrationally” requires us to infer intent from\nsubsequent demographic developments. The better guide is statutory text and the\nhistorical context that drove Congressional action.\n\n                                        -35-\n\fof “all undisposed-of surplus or ceded lands . . . which [we]re not at present under\n\nlease or permit to non-Indians,” and restored to tribal ownership the “balance of\n\nsaid lands progressively as and when the non-Indians owned the lands.” 53 Stat.\n\n1128, 1129–30 (1939). In administering the land restoration, the Secretary of the\n\nInterior sought to “add” the restored lands to, or “make them part of,” the\n\nReservation. For example, in one order, the Secretary stated,\n\n             Now, Therefore, by the virtue of authority vested in the\n             Secretary of the Interior by section 5 of the Act of July 27,\n             1939 (53 Stat. 1128-1130), I hereby find that the\n             restoration to tribal ownership of the lands described\n             above, which are classified as undisposed of, ceded lands\n             of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming, . . . will be in\n             the tribal interest, and they are hereby restored to tribal\n             ownership for the use and benefit of the Shoshone-\n             Arapahoe Tribes of Indians of the Wind River Reservation,\n             Wyoming, and are added to and made part of the existing\n             Wind River Reservation . . . .\n\n9 Fed. Reg. 9,754 (1944) (emphasis added). It is difficult to conceive why the\n\nSecretary would have used such language if indeed the ceded lands at all relevant\n\ntimes remained part of the Reservation.\n\n      Subsequent statements made by Congress also indicate Congress believed\n\nthe 1905 Act changed the Reservation’s boundaries. In 1907, Congress extended\n\nthe time for entry onto the ceded territory. In that Act, Congress referred to the\n\nland as “lands formerly embraced in the Wind River of Shoshone Indian\n\nReservation, in Wyoming, which were opened for entry.” 34 Stat. 849 (1907)\n\n(emphasis added); see also H.R. Doc. No. 64-1757, at 9 (1916) (stating “the\n\n                                          -36-\n\f[irrigation] project under consideration is within the ‘ceded lands’ portion of what\n\nwas formerly included in the Wind River or Shoshone Indian Reservation”\n\n(emphasis added)). Again, Congress’s consistent reference to lands that were\n\nformerly part of the Reservation is probative of diminishment.\n\n      Likewise, some maps from the period indicate the Reservation only\n\nincluded the unopened lands. See JA 3638 (explaining 1907 map by the State of\n\nWyoming and 1912 map by the General Land Office purported to show the\n\nReservation’s boundaries only encompassed lands unopened by the 1905 Act).\n\nBut, as the solicitor pointed out in her 2011 opinion, other maps merely reference\n\nthe ceded lands as “open lands.” Id. Ultimately, we agree with the solicitor that\n\n“[t]hese references are ambiguous and inconsistent at best.” Id.\n\n      We also briefly consider the subsequent demographics of the ceded area,\n\nthough this consideration is the least probative of congressional intent. Solem,\n\n465 U.S. at 471–72. As we have previously stated, “‘subsequent events and\n\ndemographic history can support and confirm other evidence but cannot stand on\n\ntheir own; by the same token they cannot undermine substantial and compelling\n\nevidence from an Act and events surrounding its passage.’” Osage Nation, 597\n\nF.3d at 1122 (quoting Yazzie, 909 F.2d at 1396). Here, the demographic history is\n\nmixed. On the one hand, only a small portion of the ceded land was ultimately\n\nsold to non-Indians because of disinterest in the area. See JA 3638. On the other\n\nhand, as the Wyoming Supreme Court has noted, roughly ninety-two percent of\n\n                                        -37-\n\fthe population of Riverton—the largest township on the ceded land—is non-\n\nIndian. Yellowbear, 174 P.3d at 1283. These mixed demographics do not\n\nestablish that “non-Indian settlers flooded into the opened portion,” causing the\n\narea to “los[e] its Indian character,” Solem, 465 U.S. at 471–72; by the same\n\ntoken, they do not undermine our conclusion that the statutory language and\n\nhistorical context of the 1905 Act compel a finding of diminishment.\n\n      Finally, jurisdictional and judicial treatment of the area is also mixed and\n\nthus has little probative value. Wyoming has previously exercised criminal\n\njurisdiction over parts of the disputed area. For example, in a 1960 opinion the\n\nWyoming Supreme Court found the state had jurisdiction over a crime that\n\noccurred north of Riverton in the ceded lands. Blackburn v. State </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1144565\"><a href=\"/opinion/1144565/blackburn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n179–80 (Wyo. 1960). Ten years later, the court held the state had jurisdiction\n\nover a murder committed in Riverton. State v. Moss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1401971\"><a href=\"/opinion/1401971/state-v-moss/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (Wyo.\n\n1970). And in Yellowbear, the court applied the Solem factors and concluded\n\n“that it was the intent of Congress in passing the 1905 Act to diminish the Wind\n\nRiver Indian Reservation.” 174 P.3d at 1284. The court thus determined the state\n\nhad jurisdiction to prosecute Yellowbear. Id. Upon habeas review, we declined\n\nto disturb that decision. Yellowbear, 380 F. App’x at 743.\n\n      On the other hand, both Wyoming and several federal agencies have\n\nexercised civil jurisdiction over the disputed area. Aple. EPA Br. 65–66. And in\n\ndeciding Dry Creek Lodge, Inc. v. Arapahoe & Shoshone Tribes, we summarily\n\n                                        -38-\n\freferred to the town of Riverton as being within the boundaries of the\n\nReservation. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379169\"><a href=\"/opinion/379169/dry-creek-lodge-inc-a-wyoming-corporation-v-arapahoe-and-shoshone/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683 (10th Cir. 1980) (“Plaintiffs’ land is within the\n\nexterior boundaries of the Wind River Reservation of the Shoshone and Arapahoe\n\nIndians in Wyoming.”). But as the EPA acknowledged in its decision below, Dry\n\nCreek is “generally unrevealing regarding the legal effect of the 1905 Act,” given\n\nthat we did not consider the 1905 Act in light of the Solem criteria. JA 4645.\n\n       Adding to the varied treatment is the Wyoming Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin In re General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Big Horn River\n\nSystem (Big Horn I), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1202672\"><a href=\"/opinion/1202672/in-re-rights-to-use-water-in-big-horn-river/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Wyo. 1988), aff’d sub nom.

But Big Horn I actually tells us little about how courts have treated\n\nthe Wind River Reservation. Contrary to the Tribes’ assertion, the court in Big\n\nHorn I did not interpret the 1905 Act as maintaining a larger Reservation.\n\nInstead, the court merely held the 1905 Act did not evince a clear intent to\n\nabrogate the water rights granted to the entire Wind River Reservation at its\n\ncreation in 1868. Big Horn I, 753 P.2d at 93–94. The court never stated that its\n\nallocation of water rights was based upon the Reservation boundaries, nor did it\n\nmake a specific finding about those boundaries.\n\n      Nevertheless, the Northern Arapaho argue Big Horn I bars Wyoming from\n\nchallenging the EPA’s boundary determination on res judicata grounds. But, as\n\ndetailed above, Big Horn I concerned the allocation of water rights, specifically\n\n                                        -39-\n\fthe priority dates for those rights. 753 P.2d at 83. The special master’s\n\nconclusion that the 1905 Act did not sever the 1868 priority date for water rights,\n\nsee id. at 92, is not determinative on the issue of diminishment—the issues are\n\nmutually exclusive, and Wyoming is not relitigating the water rights\n\ndetermination. Indeed, in dispensing of the issue, the Wyoming Supreme Court\n\nmerely stated, “A reservation of water with an 1868 priority date is not\n\ninconsistent with the permit provisions of the pre-Winters 1905 Act.” Id. at 93.\n\nEven more detrimental to the Northern Arapaho’s position, the Wyoming\n\nSupreme Court has since expressly rejected the Tribe’s characterization of Big\n\nHorn I. In Yellowbear, the court stated “while [the majority and the dissent]\n\ndisagreed over whether reserved water rights continued to exist in the ceded\n\nlands, the majority and dissent in Big Horn River agreed that the reservation had\n\nbeen diminished.” 174 P.3d at 1283 (emphasis added).\n\n      In sum, on balance the subsequent treatment of the ceded lands neither\n\nbolsters nor undermines our conclusion, based on steps one and two of the Solem\n\nframework, that the 1905 Act diminished the Wind River Reservation.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we find Congress diminished the boundaries of\n\nthe Wind River Reservation. We therefore GRANT Wyoming’s petition for\n\nreview, VACATE the EPA’s order, and REMAND for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        -40-\n\f14-9512 & 14-9514, Wyoming v.

The federal government was to act as trustee by selling\n\nthe lands and paying the Indians the proceeds. Act of March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1016 (the\n\n“1905 Act” or the “Act”). From this placement of property into trust status in exchange\n\nfor a conditional promise of payment, my colleagues in the majority infer clear\n\ncongressional intent to diminish the Wind River Reservation. I cannot agree. By\n\nderiving an intent to diminish absent sum-certain payment or statutory language restoring\n\nlands to the public domain, the majority opinion creates a new low-water mark in\n\ndiminishment jurisprudence. Applying the three-step analysis from Solem, 465 U.S. at\n\f470-71, I would hold that the 1905 Act did not diminish Reservation boundaries.\n\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                               I\n\n       Our diminishment analysis begins with the statutory text. The Court has stated\n\nthat “language evidencing the present and total surrender of all tribal interests,” when\n\ncoupled with an “unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate the Indian\n\ntribe for its opened land,” creates a presumption of diminishment. Solem, 465 U.S. at\n\n470-71; see also DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 445-49 (finding diminishment based on language\n\nof cession and sum-certain payment). The 1905 Act states that the Indians “cede, grant,\n\nand relinquish to the United States, all right, title, and interest” to certain lands “within\n\nthe said reservation.” 33 Stat. at 1016. But the United States did not agree to pay a sum\n\ncertain. Instead, the Act provides that “the United States shall act as trustee for said\n\nIndians to dispose of said lands and to expend for said Indians and pay over to them the\n\nproceeds received from the sale thereof only as received, as herein provided.” Id. at 1021\n\n(emphasis added). Moreover, the Act states that “nothing in this agreement contained\n\nshall in any manner bind the United States to purchase any portion of the lands herein\n\ndescribed or to dispose of said lands except as provided herein, or to guarantee to find\n\npurchasers for said lands.” Id. at 1020. Citing the Act’s designation of a portion of the\n\nsale proceeds for per capita payments, the majority adopts the euphemism “hybrid\n\npayment scheme.” (Majority Op. 20.) However, the terms of the statute unambiguously\n\nreflect a conditional promise to pay.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Because the 1905 Act lacked sum-certain payment, the majority opinion’s reliance\n\non sum-certain cases is misplaced. It repeatedly asserts that the language of the 1905\n\nAct, like the statutory language in DeCoteau, is “precisely suited” to diminishment. (See,\n\ne.g., Majority Op. 14 (citing DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 445).) But when the Court in\n\nDeCoteau made that observation, it was comparing the statutory language of an 1889\n\nagreement to “that used in the other sum-certain, cession agreements” ratified in the same\n\nact. 420 U.S. at 446 (emphasis added).

Cf.\n\nid. at 446 (citing legislators’ statements that “ratified agreements would return the ceded\n\nlands to the ‘public domain’” to support claim that agreements unquestionably\n\ndiminished reservations).

However, the government did not\n\nprovide unconditional payment, promising only to give the Indians the future proceeds of\n\nany land sales. Id. at 164-65. And, in language nearly identical to the 1905 Act, the\n\n                                                3\n\fstatute stated that the United States was not bound to purchase or sell the affected lands\n\nbut rather to “act as trustee” in their disposal. Id. at 165-66. The Court determined,\n\nbased on this language, that although the Indians had “released their possessory right to\n\nthe government,” the lands remained “Indian lands” because any benefits derived\n\ntherefrom would belong to the Indians as beneficiaries and not the government as trustee\n\nuntil the lands were sold. Id. at 166.1\n\n       Admittedly, the retention of a beneficial interest is not dispositive of reservation\n\nstatus. See Rosebud Sioux Tribe v.

But the\n\nmajority too easily dismisses the trust status of the lands at issue. (See Majority Op. at\n\n22-23.) “The notion that reservation status of Indian lands might not be coextensive with\n\ntribal ownership was unfamiliar at the turn of the century.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 468.\n\nAccordingly, although it is not determinative, Congress’ decision not to restore these\n\nlands to the public domain cuts strongly against the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nReservation was diminished.\n\n       Given the absence of sum-certain payment or restoration of lands to the public\n\ndomain, we could easily interpret the language of cession contained in the 1905 Act as\n\nmerely opening portions of the Wind River Reservation to settlement.2 In assessing\n\n\n       1\n        The majority states that Ash Sheep is seldom cited in more recent diminishment\ncases because it addresses the different issue of whether lands became “public lands.”\n(Majority Op. 22.) But in DeCoteau, a case upon which the majority relies, the Court\ncites Ash Sheep in distinguishing Mattz based on the absence of sum-certain payment.\nSee DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 448.\n       2\n        As in Solem, the 1905 Act provides that Indians who held an allotment within\nthe opened territory would be permitted to obtain a new allotment in the unopened area,\n                                              4\n\fstatutory language nearly identical to the 1905 Act, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the\n\nDevils Lake Indian Reservation had not been diminished.

Specifically, the court held that although the language “do hereby\n\ncede, surrender, grant, and convey to the United States all their claim, right, title, and\n\ninterest” was suggestive of diminishment, id. at 1290 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Act of\n\nApril 27, 1904, ch. 1620, 33 Stat. 321-22), it did not “evince a clear congressional intent\n\nto disestablish the Devils Lake Reservation” absent an “unconditional commitment” by\n\nCongress to pay for the ceded lands, id.\n\n       The majority attempts to distinguish Grey Bear, noting that the legislative history\n\nof the act at issue there was not extensive and that subsequent treatment of the area\n\nweighed against a finding of diminishment. (Majority Op. 17 n.6.) But the majority\n\nclaims that the statutory text “strongly suggests that Congress intended to diminish the\n\nboundaries of the Wind River Reservation” and that the lack of sum certain payment does\n\n“not compel a different conclusion.” (Id. at 23.) The majority thus reaches a conclusion\n\nsquarely opposite to one of our sibling circuits, creating a needless circuit split.\n\n\n\nreferring to the latter as the “diminished reserve.” 33 Stat. at 1016; Solem, 465 U.S. at\n474 (describing unopened areas as “reservations thus diminished”). But the Supreme\nCourt explained that this phrase “cannot carry the burden of establishing an express\ncongressional purpose to diminish” because at the time of the Act, “‘diminished’ was not\nyet a term of art in Indian law.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 475 & n.17. Thus, Congress “may\nwell have been referring to diminishment in common lands and not diminishment of\nreservation boundaries.” Id. Similarly, references to a reservation “in the past tense”\nshould not “be read as a clear indication of congressional purpose to terminate.” Mattz,\n412 U.S. at 498-99.\n                                               5\n\f        The Supreme Court has counseled that “[w]hen we are faced with . . . two\n\npossible constructions, our choice between them must be dictated by a principle deeply\n\nrooted in this Court’s Indian jurisprudence: Statutes are to be construed liberally in favor\n\nof the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.” Cty. of Yakima v.\n\nConfederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112674\"><a href=\"/opinion/112674/countyof-yakima-v-confederated-tribes-and-bands-of-yakima-nation/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (1992)\n\n(quotation and alteration omitted). Adhering to that principle in this case, we must read\n\nthe 1905 Act as providing for sale and opening of lands rather than diminishment.\n\n                                               II\n\n       In very limited circumstances, courts have been willing to find diminishment even\n\nabsent “explicit language of cession and unconditional compensation.” Solem, 465 U.S.\n\nat 471. But that is true only if surrounding circumstances “unequivocally reveal a\n\nwidely-held, contemporaneous understanding that the affected reservation would shrink\n\nas a result of the proposed legislation.” Id. A “few phrases scattered through the\n\nlegislative history” are insufficient to manufacture clear congressional intent to diminish\n\nif a plain statement of that objective is lacking in the statutory text. Id. at 478.\n\n       Legislative history surrounding two ancillary portions of the 1905 Act counsel\n\nagainst an intent to diminish. First, Congress chose to omit a school lands provision from\n\nthe 1905 Act, demonstrating its view that the opened lands retained their Reservation\n\nstatus. A precursor bill, presented to Congress in 1904, initially provided that the United\n\nStates would pay $1.25 per acre for sections 16 and 36, or equivalent lands, in the opened\n\ntownships. 38 Cong. Rec. H5247 (1904). This provision mirrored the Wyoming\n\nEnabling Act, which grants sections 16 and 36 of each township to the state for school\n\n                                               6\n\fpurposes unless those lands are sold or disposed of, in which case the state may take\n\nother lands in lieu. Wyoming Enabling Act, ch. 664, § 4, 26 Stat. 222, 222-23 (1890).\n\nDuring debate on the 1904 bill, Representative Mondell proposed to strike the school\n\nlands provision. 38 Cong. Rec. H5247. He explained that although “the bill originally\n\nprovided that the State should take lands on the reservation” for the price of $1.25 per\n\nacre, eliminating the school lands provision would “leav[e] the State authorized under the\n\nenabling act to take lieu lands.” Id. (statement of Rep. Mondell) (emphasis added). Both\n\nMondell’s statement and the decision to omit the provision evince the belief that sections\n\n16 and 36 would remain part of the Reservation. The House Committee on Indian\n\nAffairs later reported that it had adhered to this policy in drafting the bill that would\n\nultimately become the 1905 Act. See H.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, pt. 1, at 7 (1905) (stating\n\nthat it had been “deemed wise by the committee to adhere to the policy laid down in the\n\nformer bill and agreement,” under which there was no school lands provision and\n\n“Indians [were] to receive the same rates from settlers for sections 16 and 36 as paid for\n\nother lands”).3\n\n       Conversely, if a school lands provision is included in a statute, the Supreme Court\n\nhas been more apt to find congressional intent to diminish. In Rosebud, for example, the\n\n\n       3\n         Although the Wyoming Enabling Act did not exempt reservations from the grant\nof sections 16 and 36 to the state for school purposes, the Wyoming Constitution\ndisclaims “all right and title to . . . all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any\nIndian or Indian tribes.” Wyo. Const. art. XXI, § 26. Because “Congress is presumed to\nact with knowledge of controlling constitutional limitations” when it enacts new statutes,\nGolan v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169714\"><a href=\"/opinion/169714/golan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1183 (10th Cir. 2007), the decision to omit the school\nlands provision is further evidence Congress believed the opened lands to retain their\nreservation status.\n                                               7\n\fCourt held that the inclusion of a similar school lands provision evinced “congressional\n\nintent to disestablish Gregory County from the Rosebud Reservation, thereby making the\n\nsections available for disposition to the State of South Dakota for school sections.” 430\n\nU.S. at 601 (quotation omitted); see also South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118166\"><a href=\"/opinion/118166/south-dakota-v-yankton-sioux-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349-50 (1998) (inclusion of school lands provision indicative of intent to diminish).4\n\nThe majority notes that the State of Wyoming may have received federal land elsewhere\n\nas a result of Congress’ decision to omit the school lands provision. (Majority Op. 33\n\nn.13.) But that is exactly the point. By striking the provision, Congress recognized that\n\nWyoming could take lieu lands elsewhere, rather than pay $1.25 for “lands on the\n\nreservation.” 38 Cong. Rec. H5247 (statement of Rep. Mondell) (emphasis added); see\n\nalso 26 Stat. at 222-23.\n\n       Also weighing against a finding of diminishment is a provision granting Asmus\n\nBoysen a preferential right to lease new lands “in said reservation” in lieu of his existing\n\nlease rights. 33 Stat. at 1020. The provision was opposed by a minority in the House of\n\nRepresentatives, who argued that Boysen should not be granted preferential rights\n\nbecause his lease would terminate upon passage of the Act, and because “other persons\n\ndesiring to enter and settle upon the lands to be opened” should stand on equal footing.\n\n       4\n        In contrast to the Wyoming Enabling Act, the statute admitting North and South\nDakota into the Union expressly provided that sections 16 and 36 “embraced in\npermanent reservations” would not “be subject to the grants . . . of [the] act.” Act of\nFebruary 22, 1889, 25 Stat. 676, 679. However, as discussed in n.3, supra, the Wyoming\nConstitution served a similar function by disclaiming “all right and title” to lands held by\nIndian Tribes. Wyo. Const. art XXI, § 26. Accordingly, even if the grant of sections 16\nand 36 on the Wind River Reservation was not expressly prohibited by the Wyoming\nEnabling Act, it makes sense that Congress would not have provided for Wyoming to\ntake lands to which the state had “forever disclaim[ed] all right and title.” Id.\n                                              8\n\fH.R. Rep. No. 58-3700, pt. 2, at 2, 3 (emphasis added). By describing the “lands to be\n\nopened” as being “in said reservation,” 33 Stat. at 1020, the 1905 Act demonstrates\n\nCongress’ understanding that the opened areas would retain their reservation status.5\n\n       The majority relies on a prior history of negotiations to conclude that the 1905 Act\n\nresulted in diminishment, citing Rosebud for the proposition that implied continuity in\n\npurpose from a prior agreement is informative. (See Majority Op. 31-32 (citing Rosebud,\n\n430 U.S. at 590-92); see also id. at 15 n.2.) But the negotiation history presented here\n\ndiffers markedly from that considered by the Court in Rosebud. In Rosebud, the Rosebud\n\nSioux Tribe reached an agreement with the United States to diminish reservation\n\nboundaries in 1901. 430 U.S. at 587. Although Congress failed to ratify the agreement,\n\nthe Court concluded that the agreement’s purpose was carried out in subsequent acts\n\npassed in 1904, 1907, and 1910. Id. at 587-88, 592.\n\n       There were several factors in Rosebud that are not present in this case. Notably, a\n\nmere three years passed between the 1901 agreement and the 1904 act in Rosebud. It\n\nshould be unsurprising that congressional intent remained static for such a brief period.\n\n       5\n          Although the trust status of lands is not dispositive of the diminishment issue, the\ninclusion of the Boysen provision is further evidence that the opened lands were placed in\ntrust for the benefit of the Tribes. Boysen had previously entered into a mineral lease\nwith the Tribes that included portions of the opened area. The terms of the lease\nprovided it would terminate “in the event of extinguishment . . . of the Indian title to the\nlands covered by” the agreement. As discussed, supra, a minority opposed to the\nprovision argued that there was no need to grant Boysen preferential rights to the opened\nlands because his existing lease rights would automatically terminate upon passage of the\n1905 Act. But as Representative Marshall, the chairman of the subcommittee that\nconsidered the Boysen provision, explained, Indian title would not be extinguished\nbecause “these lands are not restored to the public domain, but are simply transferred to\nthe Government of the United States as trustee for these Indians.” 39 Cong. Rec. H1945\n(1905) (statement of Rep. Marshall).\n                                              9\n\fHere, my colleagues rely extensively on a proposed agreement from 1891, nearly a\n\ngeneration prior to passage of the 1905 Act. (See Majority Op. 24-25, 32.)\n\n       Further, in Rosebud the reason Congress failed to ratify the prior agreement “was\n\nnot jurisdiction, title, or boundaries” but “simply put, money.” 430 U.S. at 591 n.10\n\n(quotation omitted). The 1904 act was essentially identical to the 1901 agreement other\n\nthan the form of payment. Id. at 594-97. In contrast, the government and Tribes in this\n\ncase were unable to reach an agreement as to the particular lands to be opened in either\n\n1891 or 1893. In 1891, certain members of Congress called for the opening of more\n\nlands than what was provided for in the proposed agreement. H.R. Doc. No. 52-70, at 7-\n\n8 (1892). And the Tribes rejected three separate counteroffers in 1893, indicating they\n\ndid not wish to sell the lands under discussion. H.R. Doc. No. 53-51 (1894). Thus,\n\nunlike the three-year delay in Rosebud from an agreement that went unratified because of\n\nconcerns over the manner of payment, we are presented with a fourteen-year halt\n\nfollowing negotiations that failed because the parties could not agree on material terms.\n\n       Not only did a significant period of time elapse between the 1891 negotiations and\n\nthe 1905 Act in this case, but any continuity of purpose was also disrupted by intervening\n\nagreements regarding cession of other portions of the Reservation. In 1896, for example,\n\nInspector McLaughlin successfully negotiated the Thermopolis Purchase Act, under\n\nwhich the Tribes ceded the Big Horn Hot Springs to the United States in exchange for a\n\nsum-certain payment of $60,000. Act of June 7, 1897, 30 Stat. 62, 93-94. At a council\n\nmeeting in 1922, McLaughlin expressly distinguished the agreements underlying the\n\n1897 and 1905 Acts, stating that they were “entirely distinct and separate” and that under\n\n                                            10\n\fthe 1905 Act, “the government simply acted as trustee for disposal of the land north of\n\nthe Big Wind River.”\n\n       The absence of a continuity of purpose to diminish the Reservation is further\n\nevidenced by the negotiations preceding passage of the 1905 Act. In his 1903\n\nnegotiations with the Rosebud Tribe, McLaughlin stated that he was there “to enter into\n\nan agreement which is similar to that of two years ago, except as to the manner of\n\npayment.” Rosebud, 430 U.S. at 593. In this case, McLaughlin did not tell the Tribes in\n\n1904 that he sought to reopen the 1891 or 1893 negotiations. And although the majority\n\nquotes McLaughlin’s use of the word “cede,” (Majority Op. 27), he used that term\n\ninterchangeably with the concept of “opening . . . certain portions of [the] reservation for\n\nsettlement by the whites.” Similarly, any references to a diminished reservation “may\n\nwell have been referring to diminishment in common lands and not diminishment of\n\nreservation boundaries.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 475 & n.17.\n\n       Looking to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the 1905 Act, it cannot be\n\nsaid that they “unequivocally reveal a widely-held, contemporaneous understanding that\n\nthe affected reservation would shrink as a result of the proposed legislation.” Solem, 465\n\nU.S. at 471 (emphasis added). At best, the historical record is mixed regarding Congress’\n\nintent. As such, it is insufficient to overcome ambiguity in the statutory text.\n\n                                             III\n\n       At the third step of the Solem analysis, we consider “[t]o a lesser extent . . . events\n\nthat occurred after the passage of a surplus land act to decipher Congress’s intentions.”\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fSolem, 465 U.S. at 471. But this third prong comes into play only at the margins.6 If “an\n\nact and its legislative history fail to provide substantial and compelling evidence of a\n\ncongressional intention to diminish Indian lands, we are bound by our traditional\n\nsolicitude for the Indian tribes to rule that diminishment did not take place and that the\n\nold reservation boundaries survived the opening.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 472.\n\n       Because the statutory text and legislative history in this case fail to provide\n\ncompelling evidence of congressional intent to diminish, we need not consider this third\n\nprong. Even if we did, however, I agree with the majority that the post-Act record is so\n\nmuddled it does not provide evidence of clear congressional intent. (Majority Op. 34-\n\n35.)7 But, as with the first two steps in the analysis, this lack of clarity must not be treated\n\n\n       6\n         Although I acknowledge that controlling precedent permits courts to consider\npost-enactment events, I feel compelled to remark on the irrational nature of such an\ninquiry. The demographic makeup of an area decades or more following passage of a\nstatute cannot possibly tell us anything about the thinking of a prior Congress. See Philip\nP. Frickey, A Common Law for Our Age of Colonialism: The Judicial Divestiture of\nIndian Tribal Authority Over Nonmembers, 109 Yale L.J. 1, 19 (1999) (noting “[t]he\nconceptual problem with this approach, of course, is that postenactment developments\nreveal nothing about original congressional intent, much less intent sufficiently clear to\nsatisfy the canon” requiring ambiguous statutes to be construed in favor of tribal\ninterests). The Court itself has apparently recognized the dubiousness of this analysis,\nreferring to “de facto” diminishment as a “necessary expedient.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 471,\n472 n.13.\n        The third step of the Solem analysis cannot be meaningfully described as a tool to\ndecipher congressional intent. Rather, it is a means of ignoring that intent. Courts should\nbe loath to abandon the proper tools of statutory interpretation in any context, but to do so\nwith respect to Indian law is particularly perverse given our canon of construction that\n“statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians.” Confederated Tribes &\nBands of Yakima Indian Nation, 502 U.S. at 269 (quotation and alteration omitted).\n       7\n         I also agree with the majority that this controversy has not been rendered moot\nand that the Wyoming Farm Bureau has standing. (See Majority Op. 10-11 n.1.)\n\n                                              12\n\fas a neutral element. Because we apply a “presumption that Congress did not intend to\n\ndiminish,” Solem, 465 U.S. at 481, proponents of diminishment must show that “non-\n\nIndian settlers flooded into the opened portion of a reservation and the area has long since\n\nlost its Indian character,” id. at 471. The appellants have not met this burden.\n\n       Land sales in the opened area were largely a failure. By 1915, less than 10% of\n\nthe land had been sold to non-Indians, prompting the Department of the Interior (“DOI”)\n\nto indefinitely postpone further sales. Less than 15% of the opened area was ultimately\n\ntransferred to non-Indians. Cf. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. at 339 (noting that\n\napproximately 90% of unallotted tracts were settled in that case); Rosebud, 430 U.S. at\n\n605 (same). The DOI continued to allot parcels in the opened lands to Tribal members,\n\nand in 1939, Congress restored tribal ownership over the unsold land. Act of July 27,\n\n1939, ch. 387, 53 Stat. 1128. Today, approximately 75% of the lands opened for\n\nsettlement by the 1905 Act is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the\n\nTribes and their members.\n\n       Despite the sometimes conflicting treatment of the area by non-Indian authorities,\n\n(see Majority Op. 35-40), there can be little doubt that most of the opened area retains its\n\nIndian character. Accordingly, we face no risk of upsetting “justifiable expectations,”\n\nRosebud, 430 U.S. at 605, by construing the 1905 Act as maintaining Reservation\n\nboundaries.\n\n                                             IV\n\n       We consider in this case an Act that began with Inspector McLaughlin’s warning\n\nto the Tribes that “Congress had the right to legislate for the opening of Indian\n\n                                             13\n\freservations without consulting the Indians or obtaining their consent.” Recognizing that\n\nCongress possesses the nearly unfettered power to impose its will, leaving the Tribes “no\n\nchoice but to consent,” the Court has held that “any doubtful expressions in [legislation]\n\nshould be resolved in the Indians’ favor.” Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108130\"><a href=\"/opinion/108130/choctaw-nation-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n631 (1970). This rule must be given “the broadest possible scope” in the diminishment\n\ncontext. DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 447. In interpreting the 1905 Act, we must bear in mind\n\nthe government’s “moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust, obligations to\n\nthe fulfillment of which the national honor has been committed.” United States v.\n\nJicarilla Apache Nation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (2011) (citation and quotations omitted).\n\nWith this heavy thumb on the scale, I would hold that the 1905 Act did not diminish the\n\nWind River Reservation. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f</pre>",
