Cayce\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                                              Clerk\n\n             Plaintiff - Appellee\n\nv.\n\nEDWARD MESQUITI,\n\n             Defendant - Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                Appeals from the United States District Court\n                      for the Western District of Texas\n\n\nBefore WIENER, DENNIS, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.\nJAMES L. DENNIS, Circuit Judge:\n      Edward Mesquiti was charged in an indictment with one count of bank\nrobbery and aiding and abetting thereof in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and\n2113(a). Prior to trial, the district court granted Mesquiti’s motion to dismiss\nhis attorney. The case eventually proceeded to a jury trial, with Mesquiti\nrepresenting himself throughout the trial. The jury ultimately found Mesquiti\nguilty, and he was sentenced to 151 months of imprisonment. Now represented\nby the Federal Public Defender, Mesquiti appeals his conviction, arguing that\nthe district court deprived him of his constitutional right to counsel by allowing\nhim to represent himself and that the court reversibly erred in denying a\n\f     Case: 16-50034        Document: 00513949566           Page: 2     Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-50034\ncontinuance. 1      For the following reasons, we affirm the district court’s\njudgment.\n                                                I\n       Mesquiti is a follower of the “sovereign citizen” movement, which we\nhave described as “a loose grouping of litigants, commentators, and tax\nprotesters who often take the position that they are not subject to state or\nfederal statutes and proceedings.” United States v. Weast, 811 F.3d 743, 746\nn.5 (5th Cir. 2016). An indictment was filed against Mesquiti on April 2, 2014,\ncharging him with bank robbery and aiding and abetting of same, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2113(a), and he was appointed counsel the next day. On\nApril 8, 2014, the court granted Mesquiti’s motion to replace his appointed\ncounsel with a retained attorney, Richard Langlois. On July 30, Langlois\nreceived a letter from Mesquiti, notifying him that his “representation of the\n‘Corporate fiction/ens legis Debtor; Edward Mesquiti Jr. . . . is no longer\nneeded” and asking him to notify the court of his removal as “legal\nrepresentative.”\n       The following day, Mesquiti filed with the court a pro se document titled\n“Notice and Declaration of Revocation of Power of Attorney and Notice and\nDeclaration of Fraud and Notice to Cease and Desist,” in which he said that\n“all power of attorney . . . is wholly revoked, extinguished, canceled, [and]\nmade null and void.” Langlois thereafter moved to withdraw as counsel, and,\non August 20, a hearing on the motion was held before a magistrate judge.\nDuring the hearing, the magistrate judge repeatedly asked Mesquiti if he\nwished to represent himself, but Mesquiti was unresponsive, instead making\n\n\n\n       1 Mesquiti also argues that the he was deprived of an opportunity to prepare and\npresent a defense, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, because he lacked access to legal\nmaterials, but he concedes that this argument is foreclosed by Degrate v. Godwin, 84 F.3d\n768, 769 (5th Cir. 1996), and he raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.\n                                                2\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\nstatements consistent with his sovereign citizen ideology and asserting that he\ndid “not consent to these proceedings.” The magistrate judge concluded that\nhe could not say that Mesquiti wished to represent himself, and he therefore\nappointed the Federal Public Defender to represent Mesquiti after granting\nLanglois’s motion to withdraw.\n      On February 5, 2015, the court conducted a docket call, during which\nMesquiti was uncooperative.      After Mesquiti’s appointed counsel, Alfredo\nVillarreal, announced that he represented him, Mesquiti declared, “[H]e is not\nhere for me” and asserted that the court had “no subject matter jurisdiction.”\nBoth Villarreal and the Government’s attorney expressed doubts about\nMesquiti’s competence to stand trial, and the district court ordered a\ncompetency evaluation. The court subsequently received a thorough report by\na licensed psychologist opining that Mesquiti was competent to stand trial, his\nadherence to the sovereign citizen ideology notwithstanding. The report also\nnoted that, with respect to his need for representation, Mesquiti stated that\n“he is not trying to represent himself nor does he need a lawyer because the\nneed for representation comes after the court establishes it has jurisdiction\nover him.” In light of the report’s conclusions, the court found that Mesquiti\nwas competent to stand trial.\n      On June 17, 2015, the court held a pretrial hearing during which\nVillarreal announced that Mesquiti was ready for trial.          After the court\nexplained to Mesquiti that his attorney stated that he wanted to go to trial,\nMesquiti said, “Your Honor, I haven’t accepted Mr. Villarreal as my attorney.\nI don’t consent to him being my attorney. I have never asked him to be my\nattorney.” The court construed Mesquiti’s statement as “a motion to withdraw\nVillarreal as [his] attorney” and stated, “You have a right to represent yourself.\nThe motion is granted. Mr. Villarreal will be standby counsel.” The district\ncourt then warned Mesquiti that proceeding pro se was not advisable. The\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566     Page: 4    Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-50034\ncourt told Mesquiti that it was “generally a very bad idea to proceed pro se,”\nthat it was “always inadvisable” to do so, and that he “really need[ed] to have\na lawyer.” The district court told Mesquiti that he had been charged with a\nbank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113, and informed him that, if found\nguilty, his sentencing guidelines range would be 121 to 151 months but that he\nwould face up to twenty years of imprisonment.          The court also warned\nMesquiti that his jurisdictional arguments could not be continuously\ninterjected into the trial, as they did not have “any legal merit.”       At the\nconclusion of the hearing, the court again advised Mesquiti:\n      Again, I am telling you, it is always a bad idea for defendants to\n      represent themselves, and so I highly caution you, don’t go this\n      approach. One hundred twenty-one to 151 months is a long time\n      in prison and potentially you could be facing up to 20 years. And\n      so you know what happened that day. You know what the evidence\n      is the government has against you. Your codefendant, I believe, is\n      going to be testifying against you, so this is not a good posture you\n      are in.\nWhen asked if he had anything to say, Mesquiti replied, “I don’t accept Mr.\nVillarreal as my lawyer and I don’t consent to these proceedings, sir.” The\ncourt relieved Villarreal from representing Mesquiti and instructed him to\nserve as standby counsel, informing Mesquiti that he could change his mind\nand ask that Villarreal take over as lead counsel.\n      On the first day of trial, July 7, 2015, before jury selection began,\nMesquiti stated to the court that he had been “locked up in segregation” and\nthat he had had “no access to courts, no way to get paper, no way to write.”\nThe Government’s attorney responded that she had mailed copies of all of the\nGovernment’s filings to Mesquiti at his place of confinement, and she pointed\nout that all of the Government’s evidence was available in the courtroom if he\nwished to review it. The district court construed Mesquiti’s argument as a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment and denied that purported motion.\n\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\n      Later that day, during an afternoon break in the trial proceedings,\nMesquiti made the following statement:\n      Your Honor, about my Sixth Amendment right to have my own\n      witnesses, to have my own discovery evidence put in, I mean, I’ve\n      been held under conditions that don’t allow me to do any of that,\n      to have — to subpoena witnesses, to have any kind of discovery\n      added to this trial. I’m sure you can — I have the constitutional\n      right to defend myself. And without my witnesses, I’m barred from\n      putting on a defense.\nIn response, the district court stated that Mesquiti had known that his trial\nwas scheduled for that day and that he had declined representation by an\nattorney and had insisted on representing himself. Mesquiti then asserted\nthat he had been given discovery just forty-five minutes before the trial began,\nto which the district court responded that discovery had been provided to\nMesquiti’s counsel but he had refused to meet with his counsel.\n      At the close of the Government’s case-in-chief, Mesquiti called no\nwitnesses, and he rested without putting on any evidence. The jury found\nMesquiti guilty, and the district court ultimately sentenced him to 151 months\nof imprisonment. Mesquiti appeals, challenging his conviction.\n                                        II\n      First, we discuss Mesquiti’s contention that the district court deprived\nhim of his constitutional right to counsel at a critical stage of the proceeding\nby allowing him to proceed pro se. Sixth Amendment challenges to the validity\nof a waiver of counsel are reviewed de novo. United States v. Jones, 421 F.3d\n359, 363 (5th Cir. 2005). “The Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who\nfaces incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal\nprocess.” Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 80–81 (2004). To determine if the district\ncourt violated Mesquiti’s right to counsel by dismissing counsel and relegating\nhim to the status of standby counsel, we inquire whether Mesquiti properly\nwaived his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Virgil, 444 F.3d 447, 454\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 6   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\n(5th Cir. 2006). In the course of this inquiry, we ask whether the defendant in\nfact relinquished his right to counsel and whether he did so knowingly and\nintelligently. See id. at 453.\n      A. Mesquiti Relinquished His Right to Counsel\n      “Where a fundamental constitutional right, such as the right to counsel,\nis concerned, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.”\nUnited States v. Cano, 519 F.3d 512, 517 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Burton v.\nCollins, 937 F.2d 131, 133 (5th Cir. 1991)). A defendant can waive his right to\ncounsel implicitly, by his clear conduct, as well as by his express statement.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Fields, 483 F.3d 313, 350 (5th Cir. 2007). As relevant\nhere, because “indigent defendants have no right to appointed counsel of their\nchoice,” we have held that “a defendant’s refusal without good cause to proceed\nwith able appointed counsel constitutes a voluntary waiver of” the right to\ncounsel. Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting Richardson v. Lucas, 741 F.2d 753,\n757 (5th Cir. 1984)). To constitute waiver, such a refusal must take the form\nof “a persistent, unreasonable demand for dismissal of counsel.” United States\nv. Moore, 706 F.2d 538, 540 (5th Cir. 1983).\n      Mesquiti contends that he had not waived his right to counsel at the\npretrial hearing on June 15, 2015, before the court dismissed Villarreal from\nrepresentation and instated him as standby counsel. We conclude, however,\nthat Mesquiti’s actions before and on the day of the hearing constituted waiver\nof his right to counsel. Mesquiti acted to terminate his representation by three\ndifferent attorneys, retained and appointed.       He renounced his last two\nattorneys in hearings before two different courts. At no point did Mesquiti\narticulate dissatisfaction with his particular counsel, and he never asked the\ncourt for substitute counsel. While it is true that Mesquiti did not expressly\nsay that he wished to represent himself, he “refus[ed] without good cause to\nproceed with able appointed counsel,” Fields, 483 F.3d at 350 (quoting\n                                        6\n\f    Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566        Page: 7   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-50034\nRichardson, 741 F.2d at 757), and made “persistent, unreasonable demand[s]\nfor dismissal of counsel,” Moore, 706 F.2d at 540. Mesquiti’s conduct therefore\nconstituted a relinquishment of his right to counsel.\n      B. Mesquiti’s Relinquishment of His Right to Counsel was “Knowing and\n         Intelligent”\n      “Waiver of the right to counsel, as of constitutional rights in the criminal\nprocess generally, must be a ‘knowing, intelligent act done with sufficient\nawareness of the relevant circumstances.’” Tovar, 541 U.S. at 81 (alteration\nomitted) (quoting Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970)). In Faretta\nv. California, the seminal case explaining the requirements for waiver of\ncounsel, the Supreme Court mandated that the defendant “be made aware of\nthe dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will\nestablish that ‘he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes\nopen.’” 422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975) (quoting Adams v. U.S. ex rel. McCann, 317\nU.S. 269, 279 (1942)). However, the Court has not “prescribed any formula or\nscript to be read to a defendant who states that he elects to proceed without\ncounsel.” Tovar, 541 U.S. at 88.\n      We have required district courts to exercise discretion in determining the\nprecise nature of the warning provided to a defendant seeking to represent\nhimself, depending on the circumstances of the individual case. E.g., United\nStates v. Davis, 269 F.3d 514, 519 (5th Cir. 2001). The trial court must consider\nvarious factors, including “the defendant’s age and education and other\nbackground, experience, and conduct.” McQueen v. Blackburn, 755 F.2d 1174,\n1177 (5th Cir. 1985) (citation omitted). “The court must ensure that the waiver\nis not the result of coercion or mistreatment of the defendant and must be\nsatisfied that the accused understands the nature of the charges, the\nconsequences of the proceedings, and the practical meaning of the right he is\nwaiving.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n                                         7\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 8   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\n      Although, as explained, the precise nature of appropriate warnings\ndepends on the particularities of the case, we have generally required trial\ncourts to provide warnings of substance, including at least a modicum of\nspecificity.   For instance, in United States v. Davis, the defendant was\ndissatisfied with his attorney because the attorney refused to ask witnesses\nthe questions the defendant had prepared. 269 F.3d at 516–17. The district\ncourt confirmed that the defendant wanted to proceed to ask the questions\ndespite his attorney’s advice that asking the questions was not in his best\ninterest. The court also asked the defendant if he understood that if the\nanswers implicated him, “that puts you in an awkward position . . . with the\njury” and that he would not “be able to stand up and throw a temper tantrum\nif somebody . . . says something that you believe is provocative.” Id. at 517 n.1.\nWe concluded on appeal that the trial judge’s warnings against self-\nrepresentation, which relied largely on the warnings given by the same counsel\nthat the defendant no longer trusted, were not sufficient to discharge the trial\ncourt’s duties under Faretta. See Davis, 269 F.3d at 518.\n      Similarly, in United States v. Jones, “the district court recommended to\n[the defendant] that he have an attorney[,] . . . stated that his appointed\ncounsel was highly qualified,” and asked him if he “fully realized that\nrepresenting himself was dangerous to him.” 421 F.3d at 362, 364. On appeal,\nwe found that “the district court took no steps, except in the most general way,\nto insure that Jones was ‘aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-\nrepresentation’” and therefore concluded that the court did not do enough to\nprotect the defendant’s right to counsel. Id. at 364–65 (quoting United States\nv. Joseph, 333 F.3d 587, 590 (5th Cir. 2003)).\n      Where the record demonstrates that the trial court provided advisories\nthat were more concrete, we have generally not required those warnings to be\nvery detailed. For example, in United States v. Joseph, the district court\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566     Page: 9   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-50034\nrecommended several times that the defendant allow counsel to represent him\nbecause they were very good lawyers, and, after the court instructed the\nattorneys to serve as standby counsel, it recommended that the defendant\nallow counsel to question witnesses, conduct cross-examination, and put on any\nevidence on his behalf. 333 F.3d at 590.\n      We found that this was sufficient to inform the defendant of the dangers\nand disadvantages of self-representation. Id. Similarly, in United States v.\nFulton, 131 F. App’x 441, 442–43 (5th Cir. 2005), we approved of the district\ncourt’s warnings where they advised the defendant: (1) that his case was\n“complex” and involved “complex issues”; (2) that it was in his best interest to\nproceed with appointed counsel; and (3) that the defendant faced a “daunting\ntask” if he chose to proceed on his own because he was facing a “very capable\nprosecutor.”\n      The warnings that the district court provided to Mesquiti at the June 17\nhearing satisfy the requirements of Faretta, as applied by our precedent. As\nan initial matter, the district court had all of the necessary information to\nassess Mesquiti’s ability to understand its warnings regarding the perils of\nself-representation. The court had before it a thorough report concerning\nMesquiti’s competence to stand trial. This report described Mesquiti’s age,\neducation history, employment history, relationship history, substance use\nhistory, medical history, mental health history, and legal history. The report\nnoted that Mesquiti was 51 years old, that he dropped out of high school in the\neleventh grade but went on to receive his GED, that he continuously worked\nwhen he was not incarcerated, and that he was a man of average intelligence.\n      At the June 17 hearing, the district court on several occasions strongly\nwarned Mesquiti that proceeding pro se was not advisable. The court informed\nMesquiti that, if the jury found him guilty, the applicable sentencing guidelines\nrange was 121 to 151 months of imprisonment but that he could face up to\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 16-50034       Document: 00513949566         Page: 10     Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-50034\ntwenty years of imprisonment. The court advised Mesquiti of the nature of the\ncharges against him. The court also warned Mesquiti that his jurisdictional\narguments could not be continuously interjected into the trial, as they did not\nhave “any legal merit.” The court further emphasized that the Government\npossessed substantial evidence against Mesquiti and that his codefendant was\ngoing to testify against him and thus explained that Mesquiti was “not [in] a\ngood posture.” In the face of these warnings by the court, Mesquiti stated, “I\ndon’t accept Mr. Villarreal as my lawyer and I don’t consent to these\nproceedings.”\n       Mesquiti complains that the court did not advise him that he would be\ngiving up any right to access to legal research and did not warn him of the\npractical difficulties of subpoenaing witnesses or procuring defensive evidence\nthat might be necessary to present a defense.               We agree that the court’s\nwarnings could have been more concrete. Cf. Tovar, 541 U.S. at 89 (“‘At trial\n. . . counsel is required to help even the most gifted layman adhere to the rules\nof procedure and evidence, comprehend the subtleties of voir dire, examine and\ncross-examine witnesses effectively, object to improper prosecution questions,\nand much more.’ Warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial without counsel\n. . . must be ‘rigorously’ conveyed.” (alterations omitted) (quoting Patterson v.\nIllinois, 487 U.S. 285, 298, 299 & n.13 (1988))). 2 But we cannot say that the\ndistrict court deprived Mesquiti of his right to counsel by failing to make these\nspecific advisories.\n\n\n\n\n       2 We have previously noted that “[t]he Benchbook for U.S. District Court Judges,\npublished by the Federal Judicial Center, provides a guide for questions the judge can ask to\nconvey the disadvantages the defendant will likely suffer if he proceeds pro se.” Jones, 421\nF.3d at 363; Davis, 269 F.3d at 519 n.11.\n\n\n                                             10\n\f   Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566     Page: 11   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-50034\n      The court informed Mesquiti of the nature of the charge against him and\nthe consequences of the proceedings and explained the difficulty of his\nparticular case to him. Importantly, the court also highlighted that Mesquiti\nwould not be able to continuously advance his sovereign citizen theories to the\njury, which seemed to have been the primary motivation behind Mesquiti’s\ndecision to waive his right to counsel.     The district court repeatedly and\nstrongly advised Mesquiti against self-representation in the context of his\nparticular case, and its warning equaled or exceeded those previously approved\nof by this court. See, e.g., Joseph, 333 F.3d at 590. There was no indication\nthat Mesquiti, a man of average intelligence, did not understand the\ndifficulties he faced by proceeding without counsel, and we are satisfied that\nhe “kn[ew] what he [wa]s doing.”      See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835 (quoting\nMcCann, 317 U.S. at 279).      Thus, we find that Mesquiti knowingly and\nintelligently relinquished his right to counsel at the June 17 hearing.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the district court’s dismissal of Villarreal from\nfull representation did not deprive Mesquiti of his Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel.\n                                      III\n      We now turn to consider Mesquiti’s contention that the district court\nreversibly erred in denying a continuance.      The Government argues that\nMesquiti never requested a continuance and thus that we should review this\nclaim by Mesquiti for plain error. Mesquiti concedes that he did not expressly\nmove for a continuance, but he contends that the district court should have\nconstrued his complaints about his inability to prepare for trial, expressed on\nthe morning and afternoon of the first day of his trial, as a request for a\ncontinuance. Thus, Mesquiti urges that we review this claim for abuse of\ndiscretion. Because we conclude that Mesquiti fails to establish reversible\n\n\n                                      11\n\f    Case: 16-50034        Document: 00513949566           Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-50034\nerror even under the less demanding abuse-of-discretion standard, we need not\ndetermine the applicable standard of review. 3\n       Trial judges have “broad discretion” in ruling on motions for a\ncontinuance. United States v. Scott, 48 F.3d 1389, 1393 (5th Cir. 1995). “In\nreview, we evaluate each situation on a case-by-case basis and normally\nconsider only the reasons for continuance presented to the trial judge.” Id.\n(quoting United States v. Cueto, 611 F.2d 1056, 1060 (5th Cir. 1980)). To\nestablish that denial of such a motion was an abuse of discretion, the appellant\n“must show that the denial resulted in ‘specific and compelling or serious\nprejudice.’” United States v. Barnett, 197 F.3d 138, 144 (5th Cir. 1999) (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Krout, 66 F.3d\n1420, 1436 (5th Cir. 1995)).\n       Mesquiti notes that he had only three weeks between the hearing at\nwhich his counsel was dismissed from primary representation and the start of\ntrial, and he contends that he therefore did not have adequate time for trial\npreparation.       He emphasizes that during this three-week period, the\nGovernment filed its proposed jury instructions, witness list, and exhibit lists,\nas well as a notice of its intent to use evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of\nEvidence 404(b) and Federal Rule of Evidence 609, and he asserts that he\nneeded additional time to respond to these filings. However, Mesquiti does not\nspecifically indicate what response he could have given or how his lack of\nresponse prejudiced his defense. Next, he states that he needed additional\n\n\n\n       3   Mesquiti makes no argument that we should review this issue de novo because the\ndistrict court failed to recognize his motion and did not deny it in the exercise of discretion.\nCf., e.g., FDIC v. Dawson, 4 F.3d 1303, 1308 (5th Cir. 1993) (applying de novo review because\ndistrict court denied equitable tolling as a matter of law rather than in exercise of discretion).\nAny such argument is therefore forfeited. See, e.g., Jefferson Cmty. Health Care Ctrs., Inc. v.\nJefferson Par. Gov’t, 849 F.3d 615, 626 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing United States v. Jackson, 426\nF.3d 301, 304 n.2 (5th Cir. 2005)) (issue not raised in party’s opening brief is generally\nforfeited).\n                                               12\n\f   Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 13   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-50034\ntime to request jury instructions to support his defensive theory, but he did not\nindicate to the district court that he needed more time for this purpose, and we\ntherefore do not consider this reason. See Scott, 48 F.3d at 1393. Moreover,\nMesquiti does not state what jury instructions he would have requested or how\ntheir absence prejudiced his case.\n      Mesquiti also contends that he needed additional time to procure the\nattendance of defense witnesses. Yet, he does not indicate what witnesses he\nmight have called or explain how their testimony would have aided his defense,\nand he therefore cannot establish prejudice on this basis. United States v.\nShaw, 920 F.2d 1225, 1230 (5th Cir. 1991) (“In order for an appellant to show\nthat a continuance was necessary to secure a witness, ‘[he] must show . . . that\nsubstantial favorable testimony would be tendered by the witness, that the\nwitness [will be] available and willing to testify, and that the denial of a\ncontinuance would materially prejudice [him].’”      (quoting United States v.\nUptain, 531 F.2d 1281, 1287 (5th Cir. 1976))). Finally, Mesquiti notes that he\nhad been held in segregation in the weeks leading up to his trial and asserts\nthat, while in segregation, he lacked adequate resources to review the\ndiscovery. He further asserts that his receipt of discovery shortly before the\nstart of trial was inadequate to protect his rights. However, here, too, Mesquiti\ndoes not specifically indicate how the late receipt of discovery prejudiced him,\nand, as the district court noted, Mesquiti’s standby counsel had received the\ndiscovery provided by the Government well before trial, and Mesquiti could\nhave reviewed the discovery with him.\n      Because Mesquiti fails to make the requisite showing of prejudice\nresulting from the denial of a continuance, he cannot establish an abuse of\ndiscretion by the district court. See Barnett, 197 F.3d at 144.\n                                       IV\n      For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.\n                                       13\n\f",

Prior to trial, the district court granted Mesquiti’s motion to dismiss\nhis attorney. The case eventually proceeded to a jury trial, with Mesquiti\nrepresenting himself throughout the trial. The jury ultimately found Mesquiti\nguilty, and he was sentenced to 151 months of imprisonment.

An indictment was filed against Mesquiti on April 2, 2014,\ncharging him with bank robbery and aiding and abetting of same, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2113(a), and he was appointed counsel the next day. On\nApril 8, 2014, the court granted Mesquiti’s motion to replace his appointed\ncounsel with a retained attorney, Richard Langlois. On July 30, Langlois\nreceived a letter from Mesquiti, notifying him that his “representation of the\n‘Corporate fiction/ens legis Debtor; Edward Mesquiti Jr. . . . is no longer\nneeded” and asking him to notify the court of his removal as “legal\nrepresentative.”\n       The following day, Mesquiti filed with the court a pro se document titled\n“Notice and Declaration of Revocation of Power of Attorney and Notice and\nDeclaration of Fraud and Notice to Cease and Desist,” in which he said that\n“all power of attorney . . . is wholly revoked, extinguished, canceled, [and]\nmade null and void.” Langlois thereafter moved to withdraw as counsel, and,\non August 20, a hearing on the motion was held before a magistrate judge.\nDuring the hearing, the magistrate judge repeatedly asked Mesquiti if he\nwished to represent himself, but Mesquiti was unresponsive, instead making\n\n\n\n       1 Mesquiti also argues that the he was deprived of an opportunity to prepare and\npresent a defense, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, because he lacked access to legal\nmaterials, but he concedes that this argument is foreclosed by Degrate v.

After Mesquiti’s appointed counsel, Alfredo\nVillarreal, announced that he represented him, Mesquiti declared, “[H]e is not\nhere for me” and asserted that the court had “no subject matter jurisdiction.”\nBoth Villarreal and the Government’s attorney expressed doubts about\nMesquiti’s competence to stand trial, and the district court ordered a\ncompetency evaluation. The court subsequently received a thorough report by\na licensed psychologist opining that Mesquiti was competent to stand trial, his\nadherence to the sovereign citizen ideology notwithstanding. The report also\nnoted that, with respect to his need for representation, Mesquiti stated that\n“he is not trying to represent himself nor does he need a lawyer because the\nneed for representation comes after the court establishes it has jurisdiction\nover him.” In light of the report’s conclusions, the court found that Mesquiti\nwas competent to stand trial.\n      On June 17, 2015, the court held a pretrial hearing during which\nVillarreal announced that Mesquiti was ready for trial.          After the court\nexplained to Mesquiti that his attorney stated that he wanted to go to trial,\nMesquiti said, “Your Honor, I haven’t accepted Mr. Villarreal as my attorney.\nI don’t consent to him being my attorney. I have never asked him to be my\nattorney.” The court construed Mesquiti’s statement as “a motion to withdraw\nVillarreal as [his] attorney” and stated, “You have a right to represent yourself.\nThe motion is granted. Mr. Villarreal will be standby counsel.” The district\ncourt then warned Mesquiti that proceeding pro se was not advisable. The\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566     Page: 4    Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-50034\ncourt told Mesquiti that it was “generally a very bad idea to proceed pro se,”\nthat it was “always inadvisable” to do so, and that he “really need[ed] to have\na lawyer.” The district court told Mesquiti that he had been charged with a\nbank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113, and informed him that, if found\nguilty, his sentencing guidelines range would be 121 to 151 months but that he\nwould face up to twenty years of imprisonment.          The court also warned\nMesquiti that his jurisdictional arguments could not be continuously\ninterjected into the trial, as they did not have “any legal merit.”       At the\nconclusion of the hearing, the court again advised Mesquiti:\n      Again, I am telling you, it is always a bad idea for defendants to\n      represent themselves, and so I highly caution you, don’t go this\n      approach. One hundred twenty-one to 151 months is a long time\n      in prison and potentially you could be facing up to 20 years. And\n      so you know what happened that day. You know what the evidence\n      is the government has against you. Your codefendant, I believe, is\n      going to be testifying against you, so this is not a good posture you\n      are in.\nWhen asked if he had anything to say, Mesquiti replied, “I don’t accept Mr.\nVillarreal as my lawyer and I don’t consent to these proceedings, sir.” The\ncourt relieved Villarreal from representing Mesquiti and instructed him to\nserve as standby counsel, informing Mesquiti that he could change his mind\nand ask that Villarreal take over as lead counsel.\n      On the first day of trial, July 7, 2015, before jury selection began,\nMesquiti stated to the court that he had been “locked up in segregation” and\nthat he had had “no access to courts, no way to get paper, no way to write.”\nThe Government’s attorney responded that she had mailed copies of all of the\nGovernment’s filings to Mesquiti at his place of confinement, and she pointed\nout that all of the Government’s evidence was available in the courtroom if he\nwished to review it. The district court construed Mesquiti’s argument as a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment and denied that purported motion.\n\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\n      Later that day, during an afternoon break in the trial proceedings,\nMesquiti made the following statement:\n      Your Honor, about my Sixth Amendment right to have my own\n      witnesses, to have my own discovery evidence put in, I mean, I’ve\n      been held under conditions that don’t allow me to do any of that,\n      to have — to subpoena witnesses, to have any kind of discovery\n      added to this trial. I’m sure you can — I have the constitutional\n      right to defend myself. And without my witnesses, I’m barred from\n      putting on a defense.\nIn response, the district court stated that Mesquiti had known that his trial\nwas scheduled for that day and that he had declined representation by an\nattorney and had insisted on representing himself. Mesquiti then asserted\nthat he had been given discovery just forty-five minutes before the trial began,\nto which the district court responded that discovery had been provided to\nMesquiti’s counsel but he had refused to meet with his counsel.\n      At the close of the Government’s case-in-chief, Mesquiti called no\nwitnesses, and he rested without putting on any evidence. The jury found\nMesquiti guilty, and the district court ultimately sentenced him to 151 months\nof imprisonment. Mesquiti appeals, challenging his conviction.\n                                        II\n      First, we discuss Mesquiti’s contention that the district court deprived\nhim of his constitutional right to counsel at a critical stage of the proceeding\nby allowing him to proceed pro se. Sixth Amendment challenges to the validity\nof a waiver of counsel are reviewed de novo. United States v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"39252\"><a href=\"/opinion/39252/united-states-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (5th Cir. 2005). “The Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who\nfaces incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal\nprocess.” Iowa v.

To determine if the district\ncourt violated Mesquiti’s right to counsel by dismissing counsel and relegating\nhim to the status of standby counsel, we inquire whether Mesquiti properly\nwaived his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Virgil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"41477\"><a href=\"/opinion/41477/united-states-v-virgil/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 6   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\n(5th Cir. 2006). In the course of this inquiry, we ask whether the defendant in\nfact relinquished his right to counsel and whether he did so knowingly and\nintelligently. See id. at 453.\n      A. Mesquiti Relinquished His Right to Counsel\n      “Where a fundamental constitutional right, such as the right to counsel,\nis concerned, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.”\nUnited States v.

A defendant can waive his right to\ncounsel implicitly, by his clear conduct, as well as by his express statement.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

As relevant\nhere, because “indigent defendants have no right to appointed counsel of their\nchoice,” we have held that “a defendant’s refusal without good cause to proceed\nwith able appointed counsel constitutes a voluntary waiver of” the right to\ncounsel. Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting Richardson v.

We conclude, however,\nthat Mesquiti’s actions before and on the day of the hearing constituted waiver\nof his right to counsel. Mesquiti acted to terminate his representation by three\ndifferent attorneys, retained and appointed.       He renounced his last two\nattorneys in hearings before two different courts. At no point did Mesquiti\narticulate dissatisfaction with his particular counsel, and he never asked the\ncourt for substitute counsel. While it is true that Mesquiti did not expressly\nsay that he wished to represent himself, he “refus[ed] without good cause to\nproceed with able appointed counsel,” Fields, 483 F.3d at 350 (quoting\n                                        6\n\f    Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566        Page: 7   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-50034\nRichardson, 741 F.2d at 757), and made “persistent, unreasonable demand[s]\nfor dismissal of counsel,” Moore, 706 F.2d at 540. Mesquiti’s conduct therefore\nconstituted a relinquishment of his right to counsel.\n      B. Mesquiti’s Relinquishment of His Right to Counsel was “Knowing and\n         Intelligent”\n      “Waiver of the right to counsel, as of constitutional rights in the criminal\nprocess generally, must be a ‘knowing, intelligent act done with sufficient\nawareness of the relevant circumstances.’” Tovar, 541 U.S. at 81 (alteration\nomitted) (quoting Brady v.

In Faretta\nv. California, the seminal case explaining the requirements for waiver of\ncounsel, the Supreme Court mandated that the defendant “be made aware of\nthe dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will\nestablish that ‘he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes\nopen.’” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835 (1975) (quoting Adams v.

However, the Court has not “prescribed any formula or\nscript to be read to a defendant who states that he elects to proceed without\ncounsel.” Tovar, 541 U.S. at 88.\n      We have required district courts to exercise discretion in determining the\nprecise nature of the warning provided to a defendant seeking to represent\nhimself, depending on the circumstances of the individual case. E.g., United\nStates v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25526\"><a href=\"/opinion/25526/united-states-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (5th Cir. 2001). The trial court must consider\nvarious factors, including “the defendant’s age and education and other\nbackground, experience, and conduct.” McQueen v. Blackburn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448898\"><a href=\"/opinion/448898/enoch-f-mcqueen-jr-v-frank-blackburn-warden-louisiana-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1177 (5th Cir. 1985) (citation omitted). “The court must ensure that the waiver\nis not the result of coercion or mistreatment of the defendant and must be\nsatisfied that the accused understands the nature of the charges, the\nconsequences of the proceedings, and the practical meaning of the right he is\nwaiving.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n                                         7\n\f    Case: 16-50034     Document: 00513949566     Page: 8   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-50034\n      Although, as explained, the precise nature of appropriate warnings\ndepends on the particularities of the case, we have generally required trial\ncourts to provide warnings of substance, including at least a modicum of\nspecificity.   For instance, in United States v. Davis, the defendant was\ndissatisfied with his attorney because the attorney refused to ask witnesses\nthe questions the defendant had prepared. 269 F.3d at 516–17. The district\ncourt confirmed that the defendant wanted to proceed to ask the questions\ndespite his attorney’s advice that asking the questions was not in his best\ninterest. The court also asked the defendant if he understood that if the\nanswers implicated him, “that puts you in an awkward position . . . with the\njury” and that he would not “be able to stand up and throw a temper tantrum\nif somebody . . . says something that you believe is provocative.” Id. at 517 n.1.\nWe concluded on appeal that the trial judge’s warnings against self-\nrepresentation, which relied largely on the warnings given by the same counsel\nthat the defendant no longer trusted, were not sufficient to discharge the trial\ncourt’s duties under Faretta. See Davis, 269 F.3d at 518.\n      Similarly, in United States v. Jones, “the district court recommended to\n[the defendant] that he have an attorney[,] . . . stated that his appointed\ncounsel was highly qualified,” and asked him if he “fully realized that\nrepresenting himself was dangerous to him.” 421 F.3d at 362, 364. On appeal,\nwe found that “the district court took no steps, except in the most general way,\nto insure that Jones was ‘aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-\nrepresentation’” and therefore concluded that the court did not do enough to\nprotect the defendant’s right to counsel. Id. at 364–65 (quoting United States\nv. Joseph, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"31502\"><a href=\"/opinion/31502/united-states-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 590 (5th Cir. 2003)).\n      Where the record demonstrates that the trial court provided advisories\nthat were more concrete, we have generally not required those warnings to be\nvery detailed. For example, in United States v. Joseph, the district court\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566     Page: 9   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-50034\nrecommended several times that the defendant allow counsel to represent him\nbecause they were very good lawyers, and, after the court instructed the\nattorneys to serve as standby counsel, it recommended that the defendant\nallow counsel to question witnesses, conduct cross-examination, and put on any\nevidence on his behalf. 333 F.3d at 590.\n      We found that this was sufficient to inform the defendant of the dangers\nand disadvantages of self-representation. Id. Similarly, in United States v.\nFulton, 131 F. App’x 441, 442–43 (5th Cir. 2005), we approved of the district\ncourt’s warnings where they advised the defendant: (1) that his case was\n“complex” and involved “complex issues”; (2) that it was in his best interest to\nproceed with appointed counsel; and (3) that the defendant faced a “daunting\ntask” if he chose to proceed on his own because he was facing a “very capable\nprosecutor.”\n      The warnings that the district court provided to Mesquiti at the June 17\nhearing satisfy the requirements of Faretta, as applied by our precedent. As\nan initial matter, the district court had all of the necessary information to\nassess Mesquiti’s ability to understand its warnings regarding the perils of\nself-representation. The court had before it a thorough report concerning\nMesquiti’s competence to stand trial. This report described Mesquiti’s age,\neducation history, employment history, relationship history, substance use\nhistory, medical history, mental health history, and legal history. The report\nnoted that Mesquiti was 51 years old, that he dropped out of high school in the\neleventh grade but went on to receive his GED, that he continuously worked\nwhen he was not incarcerated, and that he was a man of average intelligence.\n      At the June 17 hearing, the district court on several occasions strongly\nwarned Mesquiti that proceeding pro se was not advisable. The court informed\nMesquiti that, if the jury found him guilty, the applicable sentencing guidelines\nrange was 121 to 151 months of imprisonment but that he could face up to\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 16-50034       Document: 00513949566         Page: 10     Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-50034\ntwenty years of imprisonment. The court advised Mesquiti of the nature of the\ncharges against him. The court also warned Mesquiti that his jurisdictional\narguments could not be continuously interjected into the trial, as they did not\nhave “any legal merit.” The court further emphasized that the Government\npossessed substantial evidence against Mesquiti and that his codefendant was\ngoing to testify against him and thus explained that Mesquiti was “not [in] a\ngood posture.” In the face of these warnings by the court, Mesquiti stated, “I\ndon’t accept Mr. Villarreal as my lawyer and I don’t consent to these\nproceedings.”\n       Mesquiti complains that the court did not advise him that he would be\ngiving up any right to access to legal research and did not warn him of the\npractical difficulties of subpoenaing witnesses or procuring defensive evidence\nthat might be necessary to present a defense.               We agree that the court’s\nwarnings could have been more concrete. Cf. Tovar, 541 U.S. at 89 (“‘At trial\n. . . counsel is required to help even the most gifted layman adhere to the rules\nof procedure and evidence, comprehend the subtleties of voir dire, examine and\ncross-examine witnesses effectively, object to improper prosecution questions,\nand much more.’ Warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial without counsel\n. . . must be ‘rigorously’ conveyed.” (alterations omitted) (quoting Patterson v.\nIllinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112127\"><a href=\"/opinion/112127/patterson-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298, 299 & n.13 (1988))). 2 But we cannot say that the\ndistrict court deprived Mesquiti of his right to counsel by failing to make these\nspecific advisories.\n\n\n\n\n       2 We have previously noted that “[t]he Benchbook for U.S. District Court Judges,\npublished by the Federal Judicial Center, provides a guide for questions the judge can ask to\nconvey the disadvantages the defendant will likely suffer if he proceeds pro se.” Jones, 421\nF.3d at 363; Davis, 269 F.3d at 519 n.11.\n\n\n                                             10\n\f   Case: 16-50034    Document: 00513949566     Page: 11   Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-50034\n      The court informed Mesquiti of the nature of the charge against him and\nthe consequences of the proceedings and explained the difficulty of his\nparticular case to him. Importantly, the court also highlighted that Mesquiti\nwould not be able to continuously advance his sovereign citizen theories to the\njury, which seemed to have been the primary motivation behind Mesquiti’s\ndecision to waive his right to counsel.     The district court repeatedly and\nstrongly advised Mesquiti against self-representation in the context of his\nparticular case, and its warning equaled or exceeded those previously approved\nof by this court. See, e.g., Joseph, 333 F.3d at 590. There was no indication\nthat Mesquiti, a man of average intelligence, did not understand the\ndifficulties he faced by proceeding without counsel, and we are satisfied that\nhe “kn[ew] what he [wa]s doing.”      See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835 (quoting\nMcCann, 317 U.S. at 279).      Thus, we find that Mesquiti knowingly and\nintelligently relinquished his right to counsel at the June 17 hearing.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the district court’s dismissal of Villarreal from\nfull representation did not deprive Mesquiti of his Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel.\n                                      III\n      We now turn to consider Mesquiti’s contention that the district court\nreversibly erred in denying a continuance.      The Government argues that\nMesquiti never requested a continuance and thus that we should review this\nclaim by Mesquiti for plain error. Mesquiti concedes that he did not expressly\nmove for a continuance, but he contends that the district court should have\nconstrued his complaints about his inability to prepare for trial, expressed on\nthe morning and afternoon of the first day of his trial, as a request for a\ncontinuance. Thus, Mesquiti urges that we review this claim for abuse of\ndiscretion. Because we conclude that Mesquiti fails to establish reversible\n\n\n                                      11\n\f    Case: 16-50034        Document: 00513949566           Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/12/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-50034\nerror even under the less demanding abuse-of-discretion standard, we need not\ndetermine the applicable standard of review. 3\n       Trial judges have “broad discretion” in ruling on motions for a\ncontinuance. United States v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7021\"><a href=\"/opinion/7021/united-states-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1393 (5th Cir. 1995). “In\nreview, we evaluate each situation on a case-by-case basis and normally\nconsider only the reasons for continuance presented to the trial judge.” Id.\n(quoting United States v.

He emphasizes that during this three-week period, the\nGovernment filed its proposed jury instructions, witness list, and exhibit lists,\nas well as a notice of its intent to use evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of\nEvidence 404(b) and Federal Rule of Evidence 609, and he asserts that he\nneeded additional time to respond to these filings. However, Mesquiti does not\nspecifically indicate what response he could have given or how his lack of\nresponse prejudiced his defense. Next, he states that he needed additional\n\n\n\n       3   Mesquiti makes no argument that we should review this issue de novo because the\ndistrict court failed to recognize his motion and did not deny it in the exercise of discretion.\nCf., e.g., FDIC v. Dawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652890\"><a href=\"/opinion/652890/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-receiver-of-texas-investment-bank-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1308 (5th Cir. 1993) (applying de novo review because\ndistrict court denied equitable tolling as a matter of law rather than in exercise of discretion).\nAny such argument is therefore forfeited.

See Scott, 48 F.3d at 1393. Moreover,\nMesquiti does not state what jury instructions he would have requested or how\ntheir absence prejudiced his case.\n      Mesquiti also contends that he needed additional time to procure the\nattendance of defense witnesses. Yet, he does not indicate what witnesses he\nmight have called or explain how their testimony would have aided his defense,\nand he therefore cannot establish prejudice on this basis.

Finally, Mesquiti notes that he\nhad been held in segregation in the weeks leading up to his trial and asserts\nthat, while in segregation, he lacked adequate resources to review the\ndiscovery. He further asserts that his receipt of discovery shortly before the\nstart of trial was inadequate to protect his rights. However, here, too, Mesquiti\ndoes not specifically indicate how the late receipt of discovery prejudiced him,\nand, as the district court noted, Mesquiti’s standby counsel had received the\ndiscovery provided by the Government well before trial, and Mesquiti could\nhave reviewed the discovery with him.\n      Because Mesquiti fails to make the requisite showing of prejudice\nresulting from the denial of a continuance, he cannot establish an abuse of\ndiscretion by the district court. See Barnett, 197 F.3d at 144.\n                                       IV\n      For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.\n                                       13\n\f</pre>",
