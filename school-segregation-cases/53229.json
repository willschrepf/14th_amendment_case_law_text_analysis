We hold that the impact fees\noperated as taxes; thus, Hamilton Township was not authorized to impose them\npursuant to R.C. 504.04(A)(1).\n                        Factual and Procedural Background\n         {¶ 2} Appellee Hamilton Township is a township that has adopted a\nlimited-home-rule government, as defined by R.C. Chapter 504, and is located in\nWarren County. It has seen significant growth in recent years; the population\ngrew from 5,900 in 1990, to 9,630 in 2000, to 23,556 in 2010.\nhttp://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp1/cp-1-37.pdf (page 583, accessed May 3,\n2012);      http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/product\nview.xhtml?pid =DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table (accessed May 3, 2012)\nand http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n?pid= DEC_00_SF1_DP1&prodType=table (accessed May 3, 2012). Appellee\nHamilton Township Board of Trustees is the legislative and administrative body\nresponsible for governing Hamilton Township under R.C. Title 5.\n       {¶ 3} On May 2, 2007, the board of trustees passed Amended Resolution\nNo. 2007-0418, descriptively titled “Amended Resolution Implementing Impact\nFees Within the Unincorporated Areas of Hamilton Township, Ohio for Roads,\nFire and Police, and Parks.” The resolution adopted a schedule of fees to be\ncharged to applicants for zoning certificates for new construction or\nredevelopment. The resolution included four categories of fees: a road-impact\nfee, a fire-protection-impact fee, a police-protection-impact fee, and a park-impact\nfee. The parties in this case made the following stipulation regarding the purpose\nof the resolution:\n\n\n               The purpose of the impact fee is to benefit the property by\n       providing the Township with adequate funds to provide the same\n       level of service to that property that the Township currently affords\n       previously developed properties.\n               The Resolution assesses an impact fee to previously\n       undeveloped property, and property undergoing redevelopment, to\n       offset increased services and improvements needed because of the\n       development.\n\n\n       {¶ 4} The amount of the fees varies based upon the land use. Owners of\nproperty to be used for single-family detached dwellings, multifamily units, and\nhotel/motel rooms are assessed fees on a per-unit basis. Owners of property to be\nused for retail/commercial, office/institutional, industrial, warehouse, church,\nschool, nursing-home, and hospital purposes are assessed fees on a per-1,000-\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nsquare-feet basis. Only owners of property to be used for single-family detached\nand multifamily units are assessed the park component of the impact fees.\n       {¶ 5} For example, the fees for the owner of property to be used as a\nsingle-family detached dwelling, broken down by category, are $3,964 for roads,\n$335 for fire, $206 for police, and $1,648 for parks, for a total assessment of\n$6,153. The fees, per 1,000 square feet, for the owner of property to be used for\nretail/commercial purposes are $7,265 for roads, $432 for fire, and $265 for\npolice, for a total assessment of $7,962. The township phased in the impact fees\nover time, charging only one-third of the total fee the first year after passage and\ntwo-thirds the second year. As of August 31, 2009, the township has charged the\nfull impact fees.\n       {¶ 6} All impact fees collected by the township are deposited into impact-\nfee accounts, not into a general fund. The resolution created accounts for each of\nthe four types of impact fees. Money in each discrete account may be used only\nfor the purpose of the account.       The accounts do not contain geographic\nsubaccounts. The money in each account is to be spent on a “first-in/first-out”\nbasis, meaning that the money that has been in each account the longest will be\nspent first. Funds must be spent on projects initiated within three years of the\nfees’ collection; any money not spent within seven years of its collection is\nrefunded to the current owner of the property.\n       {¶ 7} The resolution permits the township to give credits to offset against\nthe impact fees for certain improvements. A land owner or developer can receive\npartial or full credit for contributions toward the cost of major roadway-system\nimprovements, provided the roadway is on the township’s thoroughfare plan.\nHowever, no credit will be given for dedication of right-of-ways or for\nimprovements to the major roadway system that primarily serve traffic generated\nby the improved property, such as acceleration/deceleration lanes into and out of\nthe property.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 8} The township allocates a maximum of 75 percent of the impact fees\ncollected each year to reimburse developers for eligible improvement credits. If\nthe amount allocated for reimbursements is not sufficient to make all payments\ndue to developers for that year, each developer will receive a pro rata share of the\namount owed, and the unpaid amount will be carried forward to the following\nyear.   If less than 75 percent of the impact fees collected is required for\nreimbursements in any given year, the remainder may be used for public-project\nexpenditures.\n        {¶ 9} The township will not issue a zoning certificate until the applicant\nhas paid the applicable impact fee. Within the first year of the passage of the\nresolution, appellants the Drees Company, Fischer Single Family Homes II,\nL.L.C., John Henry Homes, Inc., and Charleston Signature Homes, L.L.C., all\nsought zoning certificates to construct single-family homes; all paid a $200\nzoning-application fee and, under protest, paid impact fees of $2,030.16 per\napplication.\n        {¶ 10} Appellants named above and appellant Home Builders Association\nof Greater Cincinnati then brought this action against appellees, the township and\nits trustees, seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages,\nalleging that the impact fees are contrary to Ohio law and are unconstitutional.\nThe parties submitted stipulated facts and exhibits, and each side filed a motion\nfor summary judgment. The trial court granted the township’s motion, holding as\nfollows:\n\n\n        Hamilton Township, pursuant to its statutory limited police\n        powers, may make and fund improvements to benefit new\n        development by use of its system of impact fees, because the\n        resolution is not in conflict with any other Ohio statute, and\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       because it is sufficiently narrowly tailored to provide services to\n       the class of fee payers in exchange for the fees.\n\n\n       {¶ 11} The Twelfth District Court of Appeals affirmed. The court held\nthat, contrary to appellants’ arguments, the impact fees were not a prohibited form\nof taxation, did not conflict with general laws of the state, and did not alter the\nstructure of township government.\n       {¶ 12} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a\ndiscretionary appeal. 127 Ohio St.3d 1460, 2010-Ohio-6008, 938 N.E.2d 362.\n                                Law and Analysis\n       {¶ 13} In Ohio, “townships are creatures of the law and have only such\nauthority as is conferred on them by law.” State ex rel. Schramm v. Ayres, 158\nOhio St. 30, 33, 106 N.E.2d 630 (1952). Hamilton Township is a limited-home-\nrule township created under R.C. Chapter 504. R.C. 504.04(A)(1) states that\nlimited-home-rule townships may, by resolution,\n\n\n       [e]xercise all powers of local self-government within the\n       unincorporated area of the township, other than powers that are in\n       conflict with general laws, except that the township shall comply\n       with the requirements and prohibitions of this chapter, and shall\n       enact no taxes other than those authorized by general law * * *.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n       {¶ 14} This opinion focuses on whether the impact fees imposed by the\ntownship are taxes “other than those authorized by general law.” Ohio law\nalready empowers townships to employ specified methods of taxation to raise\nmoney to pay for police and fire service (R.C. 505.51 and 505.39), parks (R.C.\n511.27 and 511.33), and roads (R.C. 5571.15, 5573.07, 5573.10, 5573.11, and\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n5573.211). There is no dispute in this case that the impact fees at issue do not\nmeet the requirements of those methods of taxation, so if the impact fees are\nactually taxes, they violate R.C. 504.04.\n                           Distinguishing a Fee from a Tax\n          {¶ 15} The fact that the township’s resolution calls the assessments “fees”\nis certainly not sufficient to establish that the assessments are not taxes. In order\nto determine whether certain assessments are taxes, we must analyze “the\nsubstance of the assessments and not merely their form.” State ex rel. Petroleum\nUnderground Storage Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d 111,\n116, 579 N.E.2d 705 (1991), fn. 5. Although this court has stated that “[i]t is not\npossible to come up with a single test that will correctly distinguish a tax from a\nfee in all situations where the words ‘tax’ and ‘fee’ arise,” id. at 117, we can look\nto our own case law and that of other jurisdictions for guidance in making our\ndetermination in this case.\n                                   Withrow Factors\n          {¶ 16} In Withrow, this court considered whether assessments imposed\nupon owners and operators of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) by the\nPetroleum Underground Storage Tank Release Compensation Board were taxes.\nThe assessments helped fund the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financial\nAssurance Fund. That fund was created “to reimburse owners and operators of\nUSTs for the costs of corrective actions in the event of a release of petroleum into\nthe environment and to compensate third parties for bodily injury and/or property\ndamage resulting from such occurrences.” Withrow at 111. The proceeds from\nthe assessment were kept separate from the general fund of the state treasury. Id.\nat 116.\n          {¶ 17} This court cited a number of factors in concluding that the\nassessment in Withrow was not a tax, but a fee.           First, this court found it\nsignificant that the fees were imposed in furtherance of regulatory measures\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\ndesigned to address the environmental problems caused by leaking USTs; by\nstatute, the owners and operators of USTs were strictly liable to take corrective\nactions and to pay damages for leaking USTs. Id. The fund into which the fees\nwere paid ensured that UST owners could meet those statutory obligations.\n       {¶ 18} Second, the assessments were never placed in the general fund and\nwere to be used only “for narrow and specific purposes, all directly related to\nUST problems.” Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d at 116-117, 579 N.E.2d 705.\n       {¶ 19} Third, the court noted that “[a] fee is a charge imposed by a\ngovernment in return for a service it provides.” Id. at 113. And it held that in\nexchange for the fee, the UST owners and operators received protection that\nresembled insurance. Id. at 117.\n       {¶ 20} Fourth, this court was also persuaded by the fact that when the\nunobligated balance in the fund exceeded a certain amount, there would be no\nassessment for that year. Further, if the fund dipped below a certain amount, the\nassessing authority was permitted to charge a supplemental assessment. The court\nconcluded, “Thus, the assessment appears to function more as a fee than as a tax,\nbecause a specific charge in return for a service is involved.” Id.\n                      Applying Withrow Factors to this Case\n       {¶ 21} The assessment in this case differs in several important respects\nfrom the assessment this court deemed a fee in Withrow. First, the township’s\nassessment lacks the regulatory aspect of the fee charged in Withrow. Unlike the\nfee in Withrow, the assessment at issue is not imposed in furtherance of statutes\ndesigned to protect the public from harms associated with a specific industry.\nRather, it is a revenue generator with the stated purpose of guaranteeing a\nconsistent level of services to all members of the community.         It does not\nencourage the assessed parties’ compliance with certain statutory obligations or\nprotect the public from specific threats.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 22} Second, unlike the fee collected in Withrow, the revenue generated\nby the assessment in this case is spent on typical township expenses inuring to the\nbenefit of the entire community.       It is true that the Hamilton Township\nassessments are not placed into the general fund; rather, the revenue goes into\nseparate funds for roads, fire, police, and parks. However, as the court pointed\nout in Withrow, “if these assessments [are] actually taxes, the simple act by the\nlegislature of placing them in a segregated fund [does] not transform them into\nfees. We must examine the substance of the assessments and not merely their\nform.” Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d at 116, 579 N.E.2d 705, fn. 5. Here, although the\nfunds are segregated, the use of the money from the funds is general in nature.\nThe money is not earmarked so that it is spent to improve the area around the\nparticular property upon which the assessments are imposed; in other words, there\nare no geographic subaccounts among the accounts. For instance, there is no\nrequirement that money placed into the police fund goes to create a police\nsubstation near a new neighborhood. Instead, the funds can be spent on any\npolice expenditure throughout the community. Within the specific fund, money is\nspent in a general way, all toward the normal expenditures of government.\n       {¶ 23} Third, this court found that the assessment in Withrow was a fee for\na service that the government provided; that is, the fund into which the fees were\ndeposited operated, essentially, as insurance coverage for catastrophic damage\ncaused by leaking tanks. Here, assessed parties get no particular service above\nthat provided to any other taxpayer for the fee that they pay. As taxpayers and\nresidents of Hamilton Township, they are entitled to police and fire protection and\nto use township parks and roadways. They already pay taxes for those services;\nin fact, when they improve their property, they pay higher taxes than they did\nwhen the property was undeveloped. But targets of the assessment receive no\ngreater benefit than any other taxpayer despite the payment of the additional\nassessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 24} Finally, the fee that was charged in Withrow was tied to events, not\nthe spending whims of government. In Withrow, UST owners were liable for a\nsupplemental fee if the situation warranted it, that is, if the fund dwindled as tank\nleaks increased. Further, if the fund were at sufficient levels, the board could\nsuspend the fees. In regard to the township assessment in this case, there is a\nrefund of the fees only if the township decides not to spend the money. Whether\nthe money is spent is up to the local government. Since the money is not tied to\nany particular type of expenditure within any of the four funds, the only way the\nmoney would not be spent is by governmental frugality. And unlike the system in\nplace in Withrow, there is no mechanism to require a further assessment should\nthe situation demand it. Thus, unlike the fee in Withrow, this assessment is not\nresponsive to need. Thus, it bears less resemblance to a fee for a service than the\nassessment in Withrow did.\n       {¶ 25} Overall, an application of the Withrow factors in this case points to\nthe assessments as constituting taxes.\n                               Am. Landfill Analysis\n       {¶ 26} In Am. Landfill, Inc. v. Stark/Tuscarawas/Wayne Joint Solid Waste\nMgt. Dist., 166 F.3d 835 (6th Cir.1999), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\nemployed an analysis similar to that used in Withrow in considering whether\nassessments imposed by solid-waste-management districts on persons disposing\nof material at solid-waste-disposal facilities located within their districts\nconstituted fees or taxes for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. 1341.\nThe funds, collected by owners or operators of disposal facilities, were to be used\nfor various purposes, including “preparing and implementing the district’s solid\nwaste management plan,” “develop[ing] and implement[ing] * * * solid waste\nrecycling or reduction programs,” “providing financial assistance to local boards\nof health for water analysis and other enforcement activities,” “providing\nfinancial assistance to counties for maintenance of roads, public facilities, and\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemergency services which result from the location of a solid waste facility in the\ncounties,” and “assist[ing] * * * local law enforcement and boards of health [in]\nenforc[ing] littering and open dumping laws.” Am. Landfill at 836.\n       {¶ 27} The court in Am. Landfill applied a three-factor analysis that had\nbeen employed by the courts in Bidart Bros. v. California Apple Comm., 73 F.3d\n925, 931 (9th Cir.1996) and San Juan Cellular Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm. of\nPuerto Rico, 967 F.2d 683, 685 (1st Cir.1992) to determine whether the\nassessment was a fee or tax. As set forth in Bidart, a court should consider “(1)\nthe entity that imposes the assessment; (2) the parties upon whom the assessment\nis imposed; and (3) whether the assessment is expended for general public\npurposes, or used for the regulation or benefit of the parties upon whom the\nassessment is imposed.” Bidart at 931.\n       {¶ 28} The court in San Juan described the classic versions of a tax and a\nfee:\n\n\n       The classic “tax” is imposed by a legislature upon many, or all,\n       citizens. It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and spent\n       for the benefit of the entire community.       * * * The classic\n       “regulatory fee” is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its\n       regulation. * * * It may serve regulatory purposes directly by, for\n       example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by making it\n       more expensive. * * * Or, it may serve such purposes indirectly\n       by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help\n       defray the agency's regulation-related expenses.\n\n\nSan Juan at 685.\n       {¶ 29} In regard to the first two factors—the entity that imposes the\nassessment and the entity that must pay the assessment—“[a]n assessment\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nimposed directly by the legislature is more likely to be a tax than an assessment\nimposed by an administrative agency” and “[a]n assessment imposed upon a\nbroad class of parties is more likely to be a tax than an assessment imposed upon\na narrow class.” Bidart, 73 F.3d at 931, citing San Juan, 967 F.2d at 685.\n       {¶ 30} Most assessments fall somewhere near the middle of the spectrum\nbetween a fee and a tax; in such cases, the use of the funds becomes the\npredominant factor in making the ultimate determination:\n\n\n       Both San Juan and Bidart indicate that for cases where the\n       assessment falls near the middle of the spectrum between a\n       regulatory fee and a classic tax, the predominant factor is the\n       revenue’s ultimate use. See San Juan, 967 F.2d at 685; Bidart, 73\n       F.3d at 932. When the ultimate use is to provide a general public\n       benefit, the assessment is likely a tax, while an assessment that\n       provides a more narrow benefit to the regulated companies is likely\n       a fee. See id.\n\n\nAm. Landfill, 166 F.3d at 837-838.\n       {¶ 31} In applying the San Juan and Bidart approach, the court in Am.\nLandfill determined that the assessment was a tax. The court found that the entity\nimposing the assessment—the local solid-waste-management district—and the\nparties upon whom the assessment was imposed—users of solid-waste-\nmanagement facilities—were factors that weighed in favor of the assessment’s\nbeing a fee. But that was balanced by the fact that the General Assembly had\nbeen involved in authorizing the districts to impose the assessment, keeping the\ncase “near the middle of the spectrum between a pure regulatory fee and a classic\ntax.” Am. Landfill at 839. The court concluded that the third factor pushed the\nassessment into the realm of a tax: “The revenue’s ultimate use as a benefit shared\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nby the public and not just the waste disposal facilities indicates that the\nassessment here is a tax.” Id. at 839-840. The court made that finding despite the\nfact that the revenues were placed in a fund separate from the general fund. The\ncourt pointed to the public purposes to which the revenue collected was to be put,\nincluding the development of recycling programs, road and public-facility\nmaintenance, and emergency services: “These purposes ‘relate directly to the\ngeneral welfare of the citizens of [Ohio],’ and dedication to a particular aspect of\nstate welfare makes them ‘no less general revenue raising levies.’ ” Id. at 839,\nquoting Wright v. McClain, 835 F.2d 143, 145 (6th Cir.1987).\n                       Application of Am. Landfill Analysis\n       {¶ 32} Applying the three-factor test that the court employed in Am.\nLandfill in this case yields the conclusion that the assessment at issue is a tax. As\nfor the first factor, the entity imposing the assessment in this case is a legislative\nbody, not a regulatory body, which favors characterizing the assessment as a tax.\nIn regard to the second factor, the entities paying the assessment are not part of a\nsingle industry or group. The assessment applies to a fairly large swath of\npeople—anyone who wants to engage in any type of development in the\ntownship. However, it also is not imposed on every township resident. That\npushes the needle further from a classic tax, but not into the realm of a classic fee.\nThe third factor, the ultimate use of the revenue, places the assessment solidly in\nthe realm of taxation. The fact that the funds from the assessments are segregated\ninto separate accounts is irrelevant; the fact that the revenue is earmarked for\npolice protection, fire protection, road improvement, and parks that benefit the\nentire community is the key factor.       The assessments raise revenue for the\npublic’s benefit. All members of the community will benefit from improved\nroadways and parks, as well as from consistent levels of police and fire\nprotection.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                 January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                            Other State Supreme Courts\n        {¶ 33} Although Withrow and Am. Landfill are instructive as to the fee-\nversus-tax issue, neither involved the type of assessment at issue in this case.\nHowever, other state supreme courts facing very similar matters have found that\nimpact fees constituted taxes. A key factor in those cases was the extent of the\npublic benefit that resulted from the assessment. In Home Builders Assn. of\nGreater Des Moines v. W. Des Moines, 644 N.W.2d 339 (Iowa 2002), the court\nconsidered an impact fee paid by land developers and builders that was used by\nthe city to create or improve parks. The court pointed to the lack of a special\nbenefit inuring to the targets of the fee in determining that the fee was a tax:\n\n\n        [T]he fee is based on the cost of building the neighborhood parks,\n        an expense representing the general benefit to the community at\n        large. Therefore, the parks fee is not based on special benefits\n        conferred on the property owners so as to fall outside the definition\n        of a tax. See E. Diversified Props., Inc. [v. Montgomery Cty., 319\n        Md. 45] 570 A.2d [850] at 855 [Md.App.1990] (holding that\n        impact fee was not a regulatory fee where it was not based on the\n        “service provided to the property owner”); Haugen v. Gleason, 226\n        Or. 99, 359 P.2d 108, 111 (1961) (holding fee charged as condition\n        of plat approval was an illegal tax because the fees were not\n        required to be used for “the direct benefit of the regulated\n        subdivision”). To conclude otherwise would in essence permit the\n        City to assess property for a public improvement without regard to\n        the limitations on its taxing authority* * *.\n\n\nId. at 349.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 34} In Mayor of Ocean Springs v. Homebuilders Assn. of Mississippi,\nInc., 932 So.2d 44 (Miss.2006), the court addressed a city’s ordinances that\nauthorized it to collect impact fees from developers for funding various public\nimprovements and services. In holding that the impact fees were a revenue-\nraising mechanism that constituted taxes, the court concluded:\n\n\n        “Courts cannot fault the logic or the foresight that induces the\n        municipality to consider the long term impact of permitted\n        development on municipal resources and public facilities.\n        However, in the absence of legislative intent, municipalities cannot\n        depart from traditionally authorized methods of financing public\n        facilities so as to allocate the costs of substantial public projects\n        among new developments on the basis of their anticipated impact.”\n        8 McQuillin, Municipal Corp.3rd Ed., Rev.2000, § 25.118.50 at\n        384.\n\n\nId. at 60.\n                       Public Benefit Versus Private Benefit\n        {¶ 35} In the present case, the potential public benefit appears to be the\nmain reason for the assessment. But in addressing the tax-versus-fee question, the\ncourt of appeals put great stock in one of the stipulations that the parties agreed to\nin this case, using it as proof that the assessments were made for the benefit of the\ntargeted property:\n\n\n        [Appellants’] claim flies in the face of the parties stipulated facts,\n        which state, in pertinent part:\n               “The purpose of the impact fee is to benefit the property by\n        providing the Township with adequate funds to provide the same\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       level of service to that property that the Township currently\n       affords previously developed properties.” (Emphasis added.)\n              To quote [appellants], “[i]n order to be classified as a fee, a\n       charge must specially benefit the property that pays the fee.” Based\n       on the [parties’] stipulated facts, that is exactly what occurs here;\n       namely, a payment to the Township to obtain a zoning certificate\n       in order to build on property within its unincorporated areas so that\n       “that property” can receive the same level of service provided to\n       previously developed properties. By stipulating to these facts,\n       [appellants] are now bound by their agreement.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) Drees Co. v. Hamilton Twp., 12th Dist. No. 2009-11-150, 2010-\nOhio-3473, ¶ 17-19.\n       {¶ 36} It is unlikely that appellants would stipulate to a fact that dooms\ntheir claim. More importantly, the stipulation implicitly recognizes that the goal\nis for the township to have the necessary funds to allow all properties in the\ntownship to maintain their same level of service despite recent, rapid growth. The\nparties also stipulated that the impact fees were imposed “to offset increased\nservices and improvements needed because of the development.” The impact fees\nare intended to prevent any diminishment of services to anyone in the township.\n       {¶ 37} Lest there be any doubt as to whether the impact-fee resolution was\ndesigned to affect the whole community, the factual findings in the resolution\nitself contain statements indicating that maintaining the general welfare of the\ncommunity is the aim of the resolution. The resolution states that the impact-fee\nsystem “assures the continuation of capital services to benefit one of the fastest\ngrowing townships in the State of Ohio and the United States of America, utilizing\na system which is widely accepted as a valid exercise of the police power to\nprotect health, safety and the wellbeing of the community.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nThe board states in the resolution that “the protection of the health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare of the citizens and property owners of the Township” requires that\nthe major roadway facilities, fire-protection and police-protection facilities, and\nthe park facilities of the township “be improved to maintain them at their current\nlevels of service in order to meet the demands of new development.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n          {¶ 38} In Home Builders Assn. of Mississippi, Inc. v. Madison, 143 F.3d\n1006, 1012 (5th Cir.1998), the court dealt with a similar impact-fee plan and an\nordinance with language similar to the resolution in this case. The ordinance\nstated:\n\n\n          “This Ordinance shall be used for the purposes of implementing\n          and funding the [public-improvement plan] and to otherwise\n          further the protection and promotion of the public health, safety\n          and welfare of the City of Madison and its citizens and to regulate\n          the adverse effects of rapid residential development by insuring\n          adequate public facilities and services to present and future\n          residents of the City.”\n\n\nId. at 1012.\n          {¶ 39} Home Builders stated, “[I]t is difficult to imagine that an ordinance\ndesigned to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare of an entire\ncommunity could be characterized as anything but a tax.” Id.\n          {¶ 40} We reach the same conclusion. Here, the assessment results in no\ndirect service to the landowner, other than the issuance of a zoning certificate, for\nwhich there is already a separate $200 fee. When the amount of the fee exceeds\nthe cost and expense of the service, the fee constitutes a tax.          Granzow v.\nMontgomery Cty.

Roettinger, 105 Ohio St. 145, 153-\n154, 137 N.E. 6 (1922).\n                                    Conclusion\n       {¶ 41} Having analyzed the substance of the assessments, and not merely\ntheir form, we conclude that the impact fees charged by Hamilton Township in\nthis case constitute taxes. Since those taxes were not authorized by general law,\nHamilton Township was not authorized to impose them pursuant to R.C.\n504.04(A)(1). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and\nremand the matter to the trial court.\n                                                               Judgment reversed\n                                                             and cause remanded.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL, LANZINGER,\nCUPP, and CELEBREZZE, JJ., concur.\n       FRANK D.

We hold that the impact fees\noperated as taxes; thus, Hamilton Township was not authorized to impose them\npursuant to R.C. 504.04(A)(1).\n                        Factual and Procedural Background\n         {¶ 2} Appellee Hamilton Township is a township that has adopted a\nlimited-home-rule government, as defined by R.C. Chapter 504, and is located in\nWarren County. It has seen significant growth in recent years; the population\ngrew from 5,900 in 1990, to 9,630 in 2000, to 23,556 in 2010.\nhttp://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp1/cp-1-37.pdf (page 583, accessed May 3,\n2012);      http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/product\nview.xhtml?pid =DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table (accessed May 3, 2012)\nand http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n?pid= DEC_00_SF1_DP1&prodType=table (accessed May 3, 2012). Appellee\nHamilton Township Board of Trustees is the legislative and administrative body\nresponsible for governing Hamilton Township under R.C. Title 5.\n       {¶ 3} On May 2, 2007, the board of trustees passed Amended Resolution\nNo. 2007-0418, descriptively titled “Amended Resolution Implementing Impact\nFees Within the Unincorporated Areas of Hamilton Township, Ohio for Roads,\nFire and Police, and Parks.” The resolution adopted a schedule of fees to be\ncharged to applicants for zoning certificates for new construction or\nredevelopment. The resolution included four categories of fees: a road-impact\nfee, a fire-protection-impact fee, a police-protection-impact fee, and a park-impact\nfee. The parties in this case made the following stipulation regarding the purpose\nof the resolution:\n\n\n               The purpose of the impact fee is to benefit the property by\n       providing the Township with adequate funds to provide the same\n       level of service to that property that the Township currently affords\n       previously developed properties.\n               The Resolution assesses an impact fee to previously\n       undeveloped property, and property undergoing redevelopment, to\n       offset increased services and improvements needed because of the\n       development.\n\n\n       {¶ 4} The amount of the fees varies based upon the land use. Owners of\nproperty to be used for single-family detached dwellings, multifamily units, and\nhotel/motel rooms are assessed fees on a per-unit basis. Owners of property to be\nused for retail/commercial, office/institutional, industrial, warehouse, church,\nschool, nursing-home, and hospital purposes are assessed fees on a per-1,000-\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nsquare-feet basis. Only owners of property to be used for single-family detached\nand multifamily units are assessed the park component of the impact fees.\n       {¶ 5} For example, the fees for the owner of property to be used as a\nsingle-family detached dwelling, broken down by category, are $3,964 for roads,\n$335 for fire, $206 for police, and $1,648 for parks, for a total assessment of\n$6,153. The fees, per 1,000 square feet, for the owner of property to be used for\nretail/commercial purposes are $7,265 for roads, $432 for fire, and $265 for\npolice, for a total assessment of $7,962. The township phased in the impact fees\nover time, charging only one-third of the total fee the first year after passage and\ntwo-thirds the second year. As of August 31, 2009, the township has charged the\nfull impact fees.\n       {¶ 6} All impact fees collected by the township are deposited into impact-\nfee accounts, not into a general fund. The resolution created accounts for each of\nthe four types of impact fees. Money in each discrete account may be used only\nfor the purpose of the account.       The accounts do not contain geographic\nsubaccounts. The money in each account is to be spent on a “first-in/first-out”\nbasis, meaning that the money that has been in each account the longest will be\nspent first. Funds must be spent on projects initiated within three years of the\nfees’ collection; any money not spent within seven years of its collection is\nrefunded to the current owner of the property.\n       {¶ 7} The resolution permits the township to give credits to offset against\nthe impact fees for certain improvements. A land owner or developer can receive\npartial or full credit for contributions toward the cost of major roadway-system\nimprovements, provided the roadway is on the township’s thoroughfare plan.\nHowever, no credit will be given for dedication of right-of-ways or for\nimprovements to the major roadway system that primarily serve traffic generated\nby the improved property, such as acceleration/deceleration lanes into and out of\nthe property.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 8} The township allocates a maximum of 75 percent of the impact fees\ncollected each year to reimburse developers for eligible improvement credits. If\nthe amount allocated for reimbursements is not sufficient to make all payments\ndue to developers for that year, each developer will receive a pro rata share of the\namount owed, and the unpaid amount will be carried forward to the following\nyear.   If less than 75 percent of the impact fees collected is required for\nreimbursements in any given year, the remainder may be used for public-project\nexpenditures.\n        {¶ 9} The township will not issue a zoning certificate until the applicant\nhas paid the applicable impact fee. Within the first year of the passage of the\nresolution, appellants the Drees Company, Fischer Single Family Homes II,\nL.L.C., John Henry Homes, Inc., and Charleston Signature Homes, L.L.C., all\nsought zoning certificates to construct single-family homes; all paid a $200\nzoning-application fee and, under protest, paid impact fees of $2,030.16 per\napplication.\n        {¶ 10} Appellants named above and appellant Home Builders Association\nof Greater Cincinnati then brought this action against appellees, the township and\nits trustees, seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages,\nalleging that the impact fees are contrary to Ohio law and are unconstitutional.\nThe parties submitted stipulated facts and exhibits, and each side filed a motion\nfor summary judgment. The trial court granted the township’s motion, holding as\nfollows:\n\n\n        Hamilton Township, pursuant to its statutory limited police\n        powers, may make and fund improvements to benefit new\n        development by use of its system of impact fees, because the\n        resolution is not in conflict with any other Ohio statute, and\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       because it is sufficiently narrowly tailored to provide services to\n       the class of fee payers in exchange for the fees.\n\n\n       {¶ 11} The Twelfth District Court of Appeals affirmed. The court held\nthat, contrary to appellants’ arguments, the impact fees were not a prohibited form\nof taxation, did not conflict with general laws of the state, and did not alter the\nstructure of township government.\n       {¶ 12} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a\ndiscretionary appeal. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1460</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2010-Ohio-6008, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n                                Law and Analysis\n       {¶ 13} In Ohio, “townships are creatures of the law and have only such\nauthority as is conferred on them by law.” State ex rel.

There is no dispute in this case that the impact fees at issue do not\nmeet the requirements of those methods of taxation, so if the impact fees are\nactually taxes, they violate R.C. 504.04.\n                           Distinguishing a Fee from a Tax\n          {¶ 15} The fact that the township’s resolution calls the assessments “fees”\nis certainly not sufficient to establish that the assessments are not taxes. In order\nto determine whether certain assessments are taxes, we must analyze “the\nsubstance of the assessments and not merely their form.” State ex rel.

Although this court has stated that “[i]t is not\npossible to come up with a single test that will correctly distinguish a tax from a\nfee in all situations where the words ‘tax’ and ‘fee’ arise,” id. at 117, we can look\nto our own case law and that of other jurisdictions for guidance in making our\ndetermination in this case.\n                                   Withrow Factors\n          {¶ 16} In Withrow, this court considered whether assessments imposed\nupon owners and operators of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) by the\nPetroleum Underground Storage Tank Release Compensation Board were taxes.\nThe assessments helped fund the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financial\nAssurance Fund. That fund was created “to reimburse owners and operators of\nUSTs for the costs of corrective actions in the event of a release of petroleum into\nthe environment and to compensate third parties for bodily injury and/or property\ndamage resulting from such occurrences.” Withrow at 111. The proceeds from\nthe assessment were kept separate from the general fund of the state treasury. Id.\nat 116.\n          {¶ 17} This court cited a number of factors in concluding that the\nassessment in Withrow was not a tax, but a fee.           First, this court found it\nsignificant that the fees were imposed in furtherance of regulatory measures\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\ndesigned to address the environmental problems caused by leaking USTs; by\nstatute, the owners and operators of USTs were strictly liable to take corrective\nactions and to pay damages for leaking USTs. Id. The fund into which the fees\nwere paid ensured that UST owners could meet those statutory obligations.\n       {¶ 18} Second, the assessments were never placed in the general fund and\nwere to be used only “for narrow and specific purposes, all directly related to\nUST problems.” Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d at 116-117, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       {¶ 19} Third, the court noted that “[a] fee is a charge imposed by a\ngovernment in return for a service it provides.” Id. at 113. And it held that in\nexchange for the fee, the UST owners and operators received protection that\nresembled insurance. Id. at 117.\n       {¶ 20} Fourth, this court was also persuaded by the fact that when the\nunobligated balance in the fund exceeded a certain amount, there would be no\nassessment for that year. Further, if the fund dipped below a certain amount, the\nassessing authority was permitted to charge a supplemental assessment. The court\nconcluded, “Thus, the assessment appears to function more as a fee than as a tax,\nbecause a specific charge in return for a service is involved.” Id.\n                      Applying Withrow Factors to this Case\n       {¶ 21} The assessment in this case differs in several important respects\nfrom the assessment this court deemed a fee in Withrow. First, the township’s\nassessment lacks the regulatory aspect of the fee charged in Withrow. Unlike the\nfee in Withrow, the assessment at issue is not imposed in furtherance of statutes\ndesigned to protect the public from harms associated with a specific industry.\nRather, it is a revenue generator with the stated purpose of guaranteeing a\nconsistent level of services to all members of the community.         It does not\nencourage the assessed parties’ compliance with certain statutory obligations or\nprotect the public from specific threats.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 22} Second, unlike the fee collected in Withrow, the revenue generated\nby the assessment in this case is spent on typical township expenses inuring to the\nbenefit of the entire community.       It is true that the Hamilton Township\nassessments are not placed into the general fund; rather, the revenue goes into\nseparate funds for roads, fire, police, and parks. However, as the court pointed\nout in Withrow, “if these assessments [are] actually taxes, the simple act by the\nlegislature of placing them in a segregated fund [does] not transform them into\nfees. We must examine the substance of the assessments and not merely their\nform.” Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d at 116, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, fn. 5. Here, although the\nfunds are segregated, the use of the money from the funds is general in nature.\nThe money is not earmarked so that it is spent to improve the area around the\nparticular property upon which the assessments are imposed; in other words, there\nare no geographic subaccounts among the accounts. For instance, there is no\nrequirement that money placed into the police fund goes to create a police\nsubstation near a new neighborhood. Instead, the funds can be spent on any\npolice expenditure throughout the community. Within the specific fund, money is\nspent in a general way, all toward the normal expenditures of government.\n       {¶ 23} Third, this court found that the assessment in Withrow was a fee for\na service that the government provided; that is, the fund into which the fees were\ndeposited operated, essentially, as insurance coverage for catastrophic damage\ncaused by leaking tanks. Here, assessed parties get no particular service above\nthat provided to any other taxpayer for the fee that they pay. As taxpayers and\nresidents of Hamilton Township, they are entitled to police and fire protection and\nto use township parks and roadways. They already pay taxes for those services;\nin fact, when they improve their property, they pay higher taxes than they did\nwhen the property was undeveloped. But targets of the assessment receive no\ngreater benefit than any other taxpayer despite the payment of the additional\nassessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 24} Finally, the fee that was charged in Withrow was tied to events, not\nthe spending whims of government. In Withrow, UST owners were liable for a\nsupplemental fee if the situation warranted it, that is, if the fund dwindled as tank\nleaks increased. Further, if the fund were at sufficient levels, the board could\nsuspend the fees. In regard to the township assessment in this case, there is a\nrefund of the fees only if the township decides not to spend the money. Whether\nthe money is spent is up to the local government. Since the money is not tied to\nany particular type of expenditure within any of the four funds, the only way the\nmoney would not be spent is by governmental frugality. And unlike the system in\nplace in Withrow, there is no mechanism to require a further assessment should\nthe situation demand it. Thus, unlike the fee in Withrow, this assessment is not\nresponsive to need. Thus, it bears less resemblance to a fee for a service than the\nassessment in Withrow did.\n       {¶ 25} Overall, an application of the Withrow factors in this case points to\nthe assessments as constituting taxes.\n                               Am.

As set forth in Bidart, a court should consider “(1)\nthe entity that imposes the assessment; (2) the parties upon whom the assessment\nis imposed; and (3) whether the assessment is expended for general public\npurposes, or used for the regulation or benefit of the parties upon whom the\nassessment is imposed.” Bidart at 931.\n       {¶ 28} The court in San Juan described the classic versions of a tax and a\nfee:\n\n\n       The classic “tax” is imposed by a legislature upon many, or all,\n       citizens. It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and spent\n       for the benefit of the entire community.       * * * The classic\n       “regulatory fee” is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its\n       regulation. * * * It may serve regulatory purposes directly by, for\n       example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by making it\n       more expensive. * * * Or, it may serve such purposes indirectly\n       by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help\n       defray the agency's regulation-related expenses.\n\n\nSan Juan at 685.\n       {¶ 29} In regard to the first two factors—the entity that imposes the\nassessment and the entity that must pay the assessment—“[a]n assessment\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nimposed directly by the legislature is more likely to be a tax than an assessment\nimposed by an administrative agency” and “[a]n assessment imposed upon a\nbroad class of parties is more likely to be a tax than an assessment imposed upon\na narrow class.” Bidart, 73 F.3d at 931, citing San Juan, 967 F.2d at 685.\n       {¶ 30} Most assessments fall somewhere near the middle of the spectrum\nbetween a fee and a tax; in such cases, the use of the funds becomes the\npredominant factor in making the ultimate determination:\n\n\n       Both San Juan and Bidart indicate that for cases where the\n       assessment falls near the middle of the spectrum between a\n       regulatory fee and a classic tax, the predominant factor is the\n       revenue’s ultimate use. See San Juan, 967 F.2d at 685; Bidart, 73\n       F.3d at 932. When the ultimate use is to provide a general public\n       benefit, the assessment is likely a tax, while an assessment that\n       provides a more narrow benefit to the regulated companies is likely\n       a fee. See id.\n\n\nAm. Landfill, 166 F.3d at 837-838.\n       {¶ 31} In applying the San Juan and Bidart approach, the court in Am.\nLandfill determined that the assessment was a tax. The court found that the entity\nimposing the assessment—the local solid-waste-management district—and the\nparties upon whom the assessment was imposed—users of solid-waste-\nmanagement facilities—were factors that weighed in favor of the assessment’s\nbeing a fee. But that was balanced by the fact that the General Assembly had\nbeen involved in authorizing the districts to impose the assessment, keeping the\ncase “near the middle of the spectrum between a pure regulatory fee and a classic\ntax.” Am. Landfill at 839. The court concluded that the third factor pushed the\nassessment into the realm of a tax: “The revenue’s ultimate use as a benefit shared\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nby the public and not just the waste disposal facilities indicates that the\nassessment here is a tax.” Id. at 839-840. The court made that finding despite the\nfact that the revenues were placed in a fund separate from the general fund. The\ncourt pointed to the public purposes to which the revenue collected was to be put,\nincluding the development of recycling programs, road and public-facility\nmaintenance, and emergency services: “These purposes ‘relate directly to the\ngeneral welfare of the citizens of [Ohio],’ and dedication to a particular aspect of\nstate welfare makes them ‘no less general revenue raising levies.’ ” Id. at 839,\nquoting Wright v. McClain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498472\"><a href=\"/opinion/498472/norman-quincy-wright-v-jerry-mcclain-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (6th Cir.1987).\n                       Application of Am. Landfill Analysis\n       {¶ 32} Applying the three-factor test that the court employed in Am.\nLandfill in this case yields the conclusion that the assessment at issue is a tax. As\nfor the first factor, the entity imposing the assessment in this case is a legislative\nbody, not a regulatory body, which favors characterizing the assessment as a tax.\nIn regard to the second factor, the entities paying the assessment are not part of a\nsingle industry or group. The assessment applies to a fairly large swath of\npeople—anyone who wants to engage in any type of development in the\ntownship. However, it also is not imposed on every township resident. That\npushes the needle further from a classic tax, but not into the realm of a classic fee.\nThe third factor, the ultimate use of the revenue, places the assessment solidly in\nthe realm of taxation. The fact that the funds from the assessments are segregated\ninto separate accounts is irrelevant; the fact that the revenue is earmarked for\npolice protection, fire protection, road improvement, and parks that benefit the\nentire community is the key factor.       The assessments raise revenue for the\npublic’s benefit. All members of the community will benefit from improved\nroadways and parks, as well as from consistent levels of police and fire\nprotection.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                                 January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                            Other State Supreme Courts\n        {¶ 33} Although Withrow and Am. Landfill are instructive as to the fee-\nversus-tax issue, neither involved the type of assessment at issue in this case.\nHowever, other state supreme courts facing very similar matters have found that\nimpact fees constituted taxes. A key factor in those cases was the extent of the\npublic benefit that resulted from the assessment. In Home Builders Assn. of\nGreater Des Moines v. W. Des Moines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1852239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1852239/home-builders-assn-v-west-des-moines/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2002), the court\nconsidered an impact fee paid by land developers and builders that was used by\nthe city to create or improve parks. The court pointed to the lack of a special\nbenefit inuring to the targets of the fee in determining that the fee was a tax:\n\n\n        [T]he fee is based on the cost of building the neighborhood parks,\n        an expense representing the general benefit to the community at\n        large. Therefore, the parks fee is not based on special benefits\n        conferred on the property owners so as to fall outside the definition\n        of a tax. See E. Diversified Props., Inc. [v.

But in addressing the tax-versus-fee question, the\ncourt of appeals put great stock in one of the stipulations that the parties agreed to\nin this case, using it as proof that the assessments were made for the benefit of the\ntargeted property:\n\n\n        [Appellants’] claim flies in the face of the parties stipulated facts,\n        which state, in pertinent part:\n               “The purpose of the impact fee is to benefit the property by\n        providing the Township with adequate funds to provide the same\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                               January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       level of service to that property that the Township currently\n       affords previously developed properties.” (Emphasis added.)\n              To quote [appellants], “[i]n order to be classified as a fee, a\n       charge must specially benefit the property that pays the fee.” Based\n       on the [parties’] stipulated facts, that is exactly what occurs here;\n       namely, a payment to the Township to obtain a zoning certificate\n       in order to build on property within its unincorporated areas so that\n       “that property” can receive the same level of service provided to\n       previously developed properties. By stipulating to these facts,\n       [appellants] are now bound by their agreement.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) Drees Co. v. Hamilton Twp., 12th Dist. No. 2009-11-150, 2010-\nOhio-3473, ¶ 17-19.\n       {¶ 36} It is unlikely that appellants would stipulate to a fact that dooms\ntheir claim. More importantly, the stipulation implicitly recognizes that the goal\nis for the township to have the necessary funds to allow all properties in the\ntownship to maintain their same level of service despite recent, rapid growth. The\nparties also stipulated that the impact fees were imposed “to offset increased\nservices and improvements needed because of the development.” The impact fees\nare intended to prevent any diminishment of services to anyone in the township.\n       {¶ 37} Lest there be any doubt as to whether the impact-fee resolution was\ndesigned to affect the whole community, the factual findings in the resolution\nitself contain statements indicating that maintaining the general welfare of the\ncommunity is the aim of the resolution. The resolution states that the impact-fee\nsystem “assures the continuation of capital services to benefit one of the fastest\ngrowing townships in the State of Ohio and the United States of America, utilizing\na system which is widely accepted as a valid exercise of the police power to\nprotect health, safety and the wellbeing of the community.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nThe board states in the resolution that “the protection of the health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare of the citizens and property owners of the Township” requires that\nthe major roadway facilities, fire-protection and police-protection facilities, and\nthe park facilities of the township “be improved to maintain them at their current\nlevels of service in order to meet the demands of new development.” (Emphasis\nadded.)\n          {¶ 38} In Home Builders Assn. of Mississippi, Inc. v.

The ordinance\nstated:\n\n\n          “This Ordinance shall be used for the purposes of implementing\n          and funding the [public-improvement plan] and to otherwise\n          further the protection and promotion of the public health, safety\n          and welfare of the City of Madison and its citizens and to regulate\n          the adverse effects of rapid residential development by insuring\n          adequate public facilities and services to present and future\n          residents of the City.”\n\n\nId. at 1012.\n          {¶ 39} Home Builders stated, “[I]t is difficult to imagine that an ordinance\ndesigned to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare of an entire\ncommunity could be characterized as anything but a tax.” Id.\n          {¶ 40} We reach the same conclusion. Here, the assessment results in no\ndirect service to the landowner, other than the issuance of a zoning certificate, for\nwhich there is already a separate $200 fee. When the amount of the fee exceeds\nthe cost and expense of the service, the fee constitutes a tax.          Granzow v.\nMontgomery Cty.

Since those taxes were not authorized by general law,\nHamilton Township was not authorized to impose them pursuant to R.C.\n504.04(A)(1). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and\nremand the matter to the trial court.\n                                                               Judgment reversed\n                                                             and cause remanded.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and LUNDBERG STRATTON, O’DONNELL, LANZINGER,\nCUPP, and CELEBREZZE, JJ., concur.\n       FRANK D.
