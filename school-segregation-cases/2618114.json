BACKGROUND\n\n        Husband and wife were married in 1990. When the parties married, husband was a\n\nCaptain in the Army and wife was an Army nurse. The deCamps had three children—born in\n\n1992, 1995, and 1999. After the birth of their first child, by mutual agreement of the parties,\n\nwife stopped working and became a homemaker and the children’s primary caregiver. Wife has\n\nnever had a full-time job outside the home after leaving the Army in 1992. During the course of\n\nthe marriage, the deCamps moved eight times due to husband’s military orders. In July of 2003,\n\nthe family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia where husband became an adjunct professor of\n\nmilitary science at the College of William and Mary. In 2005, husband retired from the Army as\n\na Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n        Upon separation, the parties drafted a separation agreement dated January 18, 2013.\n\nRegarding the items on which the parties disagreed, they agreed to refer those issues to a Judge\n\npro tempore for a decision based on Code § 20-107.3.\n\n        The circuit court found that because husband only made approximately $7,200 per year in\n\nhis position as an adjunct professor, he was voluntarily underemployed and imputed $43,000 in\n\nannual income for spousal and child support determinations. At the time of the parties’\n\nseparation, husband has several other sources of significant wealth. The circuit court found that\n\nbased on husband’s trust income, imputed trust income, imputed voluntary underemployment\n\nincome, disability pay, and retirement pay, his gross monthly income for the purposes of\n\ncalculating child and spousal support was $31,219. The circuit court refused to impute any\n\n                                               -2-\n\fincome to wife on the basis that husband failed to present any evidence of a present job and\n\nsalary amount available to wife.\n\n       Having considered the statutory factors pursuant to Code § 20-107.1(E), the circuit court\n\nordered husband to pay wife $7,000 per month, beginning on April 1, 2014 and continuing until\n\neither party dies or wife remarries or cohabits with another person for more than a year. At the\n\nparties’ joint request, the circuit court awarded wife child support pursuant to the statutory\n\nguidelines in the amount of $734 per month.\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n                       A. Children’s Expenses and Spousal Support Award\n\n       Husband first argues that the circuit court erred by “including expenses attributable to the\n\nparties’ children in its award of spousal support to Wife, in addition to child support in the\n\namount of $734 per month for the two minor children award pursuant to Code 20-108.2, and by\n\nfailing to assign the burden of proof on that issue to Wife as the party seeking spousal support.”\n\nParsing out this compound assignment of error, we presume husband essentially argues that the\n\ncircuit court’s error is twofold: (1) it erred by failing to place the burden of proving separate\n\nspousal needs on the party seeking it, in this case wife; and (2) it erred again by failing to\n\nexclude the children’s expenses from wife’s spousal support award. In support of his argument,\n\nhusband relies on this Court’s decision in Robbins v. Robbins, 48 Va. App. 466, 632 S.E.2d 615\n\n(2006), as setting forth the “controlling rules of law” applicable to this issue. Despite husband’s\n\narguments to the contrary, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion under the\n\ncurrent law as explained in Robbins.\n\n       In Robbins, the wife, the party seeking spousal support, argued that the circuit court\n\nabused its discretion by adopting the commissioner’s method for calculating the wife’s spousal\n\nsupport award—deducting her child support award from her estimated financial needs. The\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fcommissioner based his reasoning on the fact that he could not determine what part of the wife’s\n\nclaimed expenses were attributable exclusively to the care of the minor child. Id. at 483, 632\n\nS.E.2d at 624. In reversing the judgment of the circuit court, this Court explained that “[s]pousal\n\nsupport and child support represent two distinct remedies directed at two very different interests:\n\nthe spouse’s needs and the child’s needs.” Id. at 484, 632 S.E.2d at 624. Thus, collapsing the\n\ntwo awards together into an aggregate award “constitutes an abuse of discretion as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Id. The party seeking spousal support pursuant to Code § 20-107.1 bears the burden of\n\nproving all the facts necessary for an award, “including evidence of financial need reasonably\n\nseparate from the needs of others from whom the party paying support either owes no obligation\n\nor will be satisfying that obligation, if owed, by other means.”2 Id. However, this Court\n\nexplained in dicta that,\n\n               Expenses that are indivisible by nature or trivial in amount need\n               not be segregated. While Code § 20-107.1(E)(1) requires the\n               consideration of the “needs” of the “parties,” the statute does not\n               (as the child support statute does) create a mathematical formula\n               primarily reliant on the input of financial data. Instead,\n               § 20-107.1(E) requires only the factfinder to “consider” the\n               estimated needs of the parties. By doing so, the statute thus\n               authorizes a flexible, commonsense approach to this aspect of the\n               factfinding exercise.\n\nId. at 484 n.10, 632 S.E.2d at 624 n.10 (emphasis added).\n\n       In this case, unlike in Robbins, the circuit court did not improperly relieve wife of her\n\nburden of proving her separate financial need, nor did it collapse husband’s spousal and child\n\nsupport obligations into an aggregate award.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The Court supported this conclusion by pointing to the fact that child support\nobligations calculated according to the statutory guidelines already contemplate the amount of\nspousal support awarded to the custodial parent. In other words, “[t]he very use of the spousal\nsupport award as an income enhancement to the payee spouse recognizes the payee’s own duty\nof support to her minor child.” Robbins, 48 Va. App. at 485, 632 S.E.2d at 624.\n                                                -4-\n\f       This Court held that the wife in Robbins had the burden of proving her own financial\n\nneeds separate from those expenses attributable to the support of the parties’ minor child—which\n\nwas a separate obligation of the husband satisfied through his child support payments. Id. at\n\n484-85, 632 S.E.2d at 624. The wife conceded that some of her listed expenses included some\n\nitems attributable exclusively to the children. This case is factually distinguishable from\n\nRobbins because wife only purported to claim her individual monthly expenses. Throughout the\n\ncourse of the proceedings, wife submitted several revised income and expense statements. One\n\ndraft listed $9,991.24 as her individual monthly expenses and $680 under the section titled\n\n“Children Expenses.” However, her last draft, dated August 26, 2013, listed $8,160.76 as her\n\nindividual monthly expenses and included nothing under “Children Expenses.” When asked\n\nunder oath why she had shown no expenses under the “Children Expenses” category in her final\n\ndraft, wife responded that in “[d]oing this new income and expense statement I was advised by\n\n[counsel] that those are children’s expenses and not my expenses so they should not be\n\nincluded.”\n\n       Because wife’s estimated expense statement facially included only those expenses\n\nattributable to herself, wife met her burden of proffering evidence that supported her individual\n\nmonthly expenses. Therefore, as the factfinder, the circuit court was then free to consider and\n\nweigh the evidence of her estimated needs, and award spousal support within its discretion.\n\n       In applying that discretion, the circuit court concluded that some of wife’s claimed\n\nexpenses did indeed include expenses attributable to the children such as Internet service fees,\n\nutilities, and food, however those expenses were either indivisible by their nature as noted in the\n\ndicta in Robbins or were reduced by the circuit court to exclude what the circuit court considered\n\nnon-spousal expenses. In explaining its ruling, the circuit court specifically found that both\n\nhusband and wife “included costs in some of their monthly expenses which are attributable to the\n\n                                               -5-\n\fchildren,” however “such costs were not subject to calculation.” The circuit court further noted\n\nthat it was “not aware, nor have the parties suggested any method through which a spouse could\n\ncalculate a child’s use of electricity, gas/heating oil, water/sewer, and auto repairs.” As to some\n\nof wife’s other claimed expenses, the circuit court adjusted those expenses that were subject to\n\ndivisibility on the basis that they were exaggerated or included the needs of her children. For\n\nexample, the circuit court reduced her estimated monthly grocery and dining out expenditures\n\nbecause it believed “Wife included her individual needs [with] the food needs of her children.”\n\n       In sum, the circuit court acknowledged, echoing the dicta language in Robbins, that there\n\nare some monthly expenses that are indivisible by their very nature. Finding no error in the\n\ncircuit court’s judgment, we expressly adopt as our holding here the dicta in Robbins that\n\n“[e]xpenses that are indivisible by nature or trivial in amount need not be segregated.” Id. at 484\n\nn.10, 632 S.E.2d at 624 n.10. With respect to any divisible expenses, the record here reflects that\n\nthe circuit court properly considered the estimated needs of wife and reduced her claimed\n\nindividual expenses where it believed the children’s expenses had been included in her\n\nestimations. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by failing to award a\n\nseparate and distinct spousal support award that did not include the needs of the parties’ children.\n\n                             B. Expert Testimony of Gray Broughton\n\n       Husband argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by excluding the expert\n\ntestimony of Gray Broughton (“Broughton”), which supplemented his earlier report on current\n\nnursing jobs available to wife. This Court will not overturn a circuit court’s exercise of its\n\ndiscretion in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence unless the record demonstrates\n\nthat it abused its discretion. Hinkley v. Koehler, 269 Va. 82, 91, 606 S.E.2d 803, 808 (2005).\n\n       Broughton’s initial report, dated July 10, 2013, included an evaluation of wife’s\n\nemployment potential as a nurse, considering her education, experience, age, physical and mental\n\n                                                -6-\n\flimitations, and the current job market. Broughton included in his report eight potential nursing\n\npositions he believed suitable for wife. This report was disclosed to wife’s counsel in\n\naccordance with the pretrial scheduling order. The pretrial scheduling order required that the\n\nparties complete discovery 30 days before trial. It also required that counsel exchange a list and\n\ncopies of all exhibits that were going to be introduced 15 days before trial. Trial was estimated\n\nby the parties to last two days and was set for September 11 and 12, 2013.\n\n       The trial began as scheduled on September 11, 2013. Wife presented her evidence for the\n\nfull two days estimated for the entire trial. Due to a scheduling issue, the circuit court set the\n\ntrial to reconvene on October 17 and 18, 2013 for the presentation of husband’s evidence. On\n\nSeptember 27, 2013, husband provided wife with an updated copy of Broughton’s report, listing\n\nfifteen new job opportunities suitable for wife. On October 17, 2013, when Broughton was\n\ncalled to testify about his findings in the September 27th report, wife’s counsel objected on the\n\ngrounds that the amended report violated the scheduling order. Broughton conceded that he had\n\ndone research on the current job market after the start of the trial on September 11, 2013.\n\n       The circuit court found that “it would be grossly inappropriate . . . to allow him to testify\n\nany differently than he would have testified had he been called on one of the days that we had set\n\nfor trial.” Consequently, the judge prohibited Broughton from testifying “to anything he had not\n\nyet prepared prior to September 11th and 12th.” However, the judge noted that on the issue of\n\nwhether the information provided was “stale” he would look at it “as if it was tried all at the\n\nsame time.” During the hearing on husband’s motion to reconsider, the judge reiterated that “I\n\nwant the record to state that one of the reasons that the, that 15 of those jobs were not allowed is\n\nthat they were, in my opinion, in violation of the pretrial order.”3\n\n       3\n         Wife asserts that husband’s argument was not properly preserved because he never\nproffered the disputed September 26, 2013 report. Wife is correct that an aggrieved party must\nmake a proffer of the excluded testimony to preserve a ruling for appellate review. See\nGalumbeck v. Lopez, 283 Va. 500, 507, 722 S.E.2d 551, 555 (2012) (“‘We will not consider\n                                              -7-\n\f       The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Broughton’s report and\n\ntestimony on the information he obtained after the start of the trial—September 11, 2013.\n\nHusband submitted the information to opposing counsel 15 days before Broughton’s testimony\n\nbut he failed to comply with the circuit court’s pretrial scheduling order because he failed to\n\nprovide it to counsel 15 days before trial. The purpose behind discovery rules is to eliminate\n\n“surprise at trial” by “‘disclos[ing] all relevant and material evidence before trial in order that the\n\ntrial may be an effective method for arriving at the truth and not a battle of wits between\n\ncounsel.’” Little v. Cooke, 274 Va. 697, 717, 652 S.E.2d 129, 141 (2007) (quoting Guilford\n\nNat’l Bank of Greensboro v. S. R. Co., 297 F.2d 921, 924 (4th Cir. 1962)). Here, wife had\n\nalready fully presented her case based upon the evidence available to both parties at the time the\n\ntrial commenced on September 11, 2013. The circuit court concluded and we agree that it would\n\nhave been fundamentally unfair to allow husband to offer evidence that wife was wholly\n\nunaware of until after she had rested her case. Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by excluding Broughton’s testimony.\n\n                                    C. Imputed Income to Wife\n\n       In his second and third assignments of error husband argues that the circuit court abused\n\nits discretion by refusing to impute income to wife for the purposes of calculating her spousal\n\nsupport award both in its initial ruling and in denying husband’s motion for reconsideration\n\nrequesting a delayed imputation of income within six months of the initial order.\n\n       Code § 20-107.1 grants circuit courts the discretion to award spousal support—including\n\nfixing the amount and duration. In determining the appropriate award, Code § 20-107.1(E)\n\ntestimony which the trial court has excluded without a proper showing of what that testimony\nmight have been.’” (quoting O’Dell v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672, 697, 364 S.E.2d 491, 505\n(1988) (emphasis added))). However, the record here is clear as to what new information was\npart of Broughton’s supplemental report—15 new job opportunities he considered suitable for\nwife. In fact, wife’s trial and appellate counsel, stated at trial: “And for this to come in, and I’ll\njust proffer, 15 new jobs in the September report. It’s not fair.”\n                                                -8-\n\frequires the circuit court to consider twelve specific statutory factors as well as any other\n\nconcern necessary to consider the equities between the parties. Stubblebine v. Stubblebine, 22\n\nVa. App. 703, 707, 473 S.E.2d 72, 74 (1996). “‘A court may under appropriate circumstances\n\nimpute income to a party seeking spousal support.’” McKee v. McKee, 52 Va. App. 482, 489,\n\n664 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2008) (en banc) (quoting Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, 10 Va. App. 728, 734,\n\n396 S.E.2d 675, 679 (1990)). “‘The decision to impute income is within the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court and its refusal to impute income will not be reversed unless plainly wrong or\n\nunsupported by the evidence.’” Id. (quoting Blackburn v. Michael, 30 Va. App. 95, 102, 515\n\nS.E.2d 780, 784 (1999)).\n\n       “Whether to impute income to a spouse seeking support is simply one component of\n\ncalculating the ‘amount’ of support under the statutory factors listed in Code § 20-107.1(E).”\n\nBrandau v. Brandau, 52 Va. App. 632, 638, 666 S.E.2d 532, 535 (2008). Three of the statutory\n\nfactors are directly pertinent to the question of imputation: “‘earning capacity, including the\n\nskills, education and training of the parties and the present employment opportunities for persons\n\npossessing such earning capacity;’” “‘opportunity for, ability of, and the time and costs involved\n\nfor a party to acquire the appropriate education, training and employment to obtain the skills\n\nneeded to enhance his or her earning ability;’” and “‘decisions regarding employment, career,\n\neconomics, education and parenting arrangements made by the parties during the marriage and\n\ntheir effect on present and future earning potential, including the length of time one or both of\n\nthe parties have been absent from the job market.’” Id. at 638, 666 S.E.2d at 536 (quoting Code\n\n§ 20-107.1(E)(9), (10), (11)). However, “these [three] specific factors do not render the more\n\ngeneral factors inconsequential.” Id. “Whether to impute income also depends, in part, on a\n\nconscientious consideration of all factors, including the ‘standard of living established during the\n\nmarriage,’ the ‘duration of the marriage,’ and the positive and negative ‘contributions, monetary\n\n                                                -9-\n\fand nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family.’” Id. at 638-39, 666 S.E.2d at\n\n536 (emphasis added) (quoting Code § 20-107.1(E)(2), (3), (6)).\n\n       The party seeking imputation has the burden of proving that their spouse was voluntarily\n\nforgoing employment and “is required to present evidence ‘sufficient to enable the trial judge\n\nreasonably to project what amount [of income] could be anticipated.’” McKee, 52 Va. App. at\n\n490, 664 S.E.2d at 510 (alteration in original) (quoting Joynes v. Payne, 36 Va. App. 401, 421,\n\n551 S.E.2d 10, 20 (2001)). “In determining whether to impute income, the circuit court ‘must\n\nlook to current circumstances and what the circumstances will be within the immediate or\n\nreasonably foreseeable future, not to what may happen in the future.’” Id. at 490, 664 S.E.2d at\n\n509 (emphasis added) (quoting Srinivasan, 10 Va. App. at 735, 396 S.E.2d at 679).\n\n       Generally, “one who seeks spousal support is obligated to earn as much as he or she\n\nreasonably can to reduce the amount of the support need.” Srinivasan, 10 Va. App. at 734, 396\n\nS.E.2d at 679. However, so long as the spouse seeking support has not “unreasonably refused to\n\naccept employment,” the spouse is “entitled to a reasonable time to secure employment.” Id. In\n\nBrandau, this Court affirmatively rejected the proposition that there is a statutory preset requiring\n\nthe imputation of income to a spouse seeking support if she has provable earning capacity at the\n\ntime of divorce. 52 Va. App. at 639, 666 S.E.2d at 536. In fact, this Court noted that “[n]either\n\nSrinivasan nor any other Virginia case has held that, for purposes of calculating spousal support,\n\na stay-at-home spouse capable of working must go to work immediately after the divorce trial or\n\nface a judicially imposed imputation of income.” Id. at 640, 666 S.E.2d at 536. To the contrary,\n\nVirginia cases imputing income “involved spouses who worked during the marriage but,\n\nsometime after separation, either accepted a job beneath their earning capacity or stopped\n\nworking altogether.” Id. In Brandau, this Court affirmed the circuit court’s refusal to impute\n\nincome to the wife because there were credible reasons to support its determination that\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fimputation was inappropriate in light of the conditions that existed at the time of the final decree.\n\nId. at 641, 666 S.E.2d at 537.\n\n         In this case, husband argues that the trial court erred in refusing to impute income to wife\n\nbecause she is voluntarily unemployed. Specifically, he argues that the circuit court’s decision to\n\ndecline to impute income to wife because husband failed to introduce evidence of jobs that were\n\ncurrently available to wife was in error because: (1) the circuit court’s exclusion of Broughton’s\n\ntestimony made that task impossible; and (2) there was undisputed evidence in the record that the\n\ndemand for nursing jobs was rising and jobs become available on a daily, weekly, and monthly\n\nbasis.\n\n         Wife had not worked full time outside the home since 1992. Wife did briefly work part\n\ntime as a substitute school nurse in late 2011 and early 2012 as well as an assistant soccer coach\n\nin 2011. In 1996, she had back surgery that has had a significant impact on her physical\n\nmobility. Medical experts testified that the kind of employment she could perform was limited\n\ndue to the physical tasks required for many nursing jobs. Broughton testified as to eight\n\npositions which he opined were “reasonable in distance from Wife’s home and would\n\naccommodate her physical limitations.” However, Broughton conceded that to his knowledge\n\nnone of those jobs were still available. The circuit court found that it was “constrained to find\n\nthat Husband has failed to offer any evidence of a present job position for Wife,” because\n\nBroughton “could not testify as to any jobs which were available.”\n\n         In this case, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in declining to impute income to\n\nwife. As the party seeking to impute income, husband had the burden of proving that wife was\n\nvoluntarily forgoing employment. He was “required to present evidence ‘sufficient to enable the\n\ntrial judge reasonably to project what amount [of income] could be anticipated.’” McKee, 52\n\nVa. App. at 490, 664 S.E.2d at 510 (quoting Joynes, 36 Va. App. at 421, 551 S.E.2d at 20). The\n\n                                                 - 11 -\n\fcircuit court found that he failed to do so. Husband presented one expert witness, and the circuit\n\ncourt found that witness’ testimony was insufficient to establish at the time of divorce what jobs\n\nwere available to her and what income she could potentially earn.4\n\n       In analyzing husband’s assignments of error in this regard, we initially note that the law\n\ndoes not require wife return to work immediately upon divorce to avoid judicial imputation of\n\nincome merely because she has provable earning capacity at the time of the divorce. Brandau,\n\n52 Va. App. at 639, 666 S.E.2d at 536. Rather, any decision to impute income must be done\n\nwithin a review of all the statutory factors concerning spousal support. In determining wife’s\n\nspousal support award the circuit court wrote an exhaustive report detailing consideration of all\n\nrelevant factors as required pursuant to Code § 20-107.1(E). Husband had significant financial\n\nresources. He was the sole monetary contributor to the marriage for its entire duration. By\n\nmutual agreement of the parties, wife left her nursing career in 1992 and became a full-time\n\nhomemaker and caregiver to their three children. Over the course of their twenty-one-year\n\nmarriage, wife moved eight times with husband due to his military career. The circuit court\n\nfound that wife’s nonmonetary contribution allowed husband to pursue and advance in his\n\nmilitary career.\n\n       In sum, based on the evidence before the circuit court, we cannot find that the circuit\n\ncourt abused its discretion by declining to impute income to wife because there are credible\n\nreasons in the record to support its determination that imputation was inappropriate in light of the\n\nconditions that existed at the time of the final decree.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          The circuit court noted that it did not find that wife should not go to work at some point\nor that she was not capable of finding employment. Rather, the circuit court stated at the hearing\non husband’s motion to reconsider that the issue was that husband’s expert failed to provide a\npotential income that the court could impute to wife.\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f        Husband’s third assignment of error contends that the circuit court erred by failing to\n\nimpute delayed income to wife no more than six months after the entry of its initial order. Less\n\nthan thirty days after the entry of the final decree, husband filed a motion for reconsideration\n\nrequesting that the circuit court impute income to wife in the amount equal to halfway between\n\nBroughton’s highest and lowest estimated salaries, effective no more than six months after entry\n\nof the circuit court’s order. In his motion, husband argued that “[s]ix months is a more than\n\nreasonable time for a person with Wife’s qualifications to secure full-time employment in the\n\nPeninsula market.”\n\n        The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying husband’s request for delayed\n\nimputation of income for the same reasons as stated above. In support of his motion husband\n\npresented no additional evidence, therefore the circuit court’s determination was identical to its\n\ninitial determination. The circuit court reiterated its finding that Broughton did not give “the\n\nnecessary testimony to establish a job that was available or the amount of money that she could\n\nearn in that job.”\n\n                             D. Expert Testimony of Robert Hornsby\n\n        Husband argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to credit the\n\ntestimony of Robert Hornsby (“Hornsby”), a qualified expert in real estate sales in Williamsburg,\n\nVirginia regarding the availability and cost of housing for wife. Hornsby testified that his task\n\nwas to find a home that would be appropriate for wife considering her “stature in the\n\ncommunity” within a price range of $205,000 to $325,000. Hornsby stated that husband\n\nprovided all his search parameters including price, square footage, and number of bedrooms and\n\nbathrooms.\n\n        Citing John v. Im, 263 Va. 315, 559 S.E.2d 694 (2002), the circuit court declined to give\n\nany weight to Hornsby’s testimony. The Supreme Court in John explained that “expert\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\ftestimony generally is admissible if it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence.\n\nId. at 319, 559 S.E.2d at 696. “The decision whether to admit such testimony is a matter\n\ncommitted to the trial judge’s sound discretion,” and will be reversed “only when the court has\n\nabused its discretion.” Id. at 320, 559 S.E.2d at 696.\n\n       Here, the testimony was admitted into evidence unobjected to, however the circuit court\n\nrefused to give it any weight for the same reasons it could have excluded the testimony to begin\n\nwith—because it had no probative value. The circuit court found that the facts testified to by\n\nHornsby originated solely from husband and were not based upon any facts established by the\n\nother evidence in the record or the statutory considerations. Specifically, the value of wife’s\n\nprospective home was an ultimate issue in this case and that issue was dependent upon husband’s\n\nability to pay, the standard of living established during the marriage, and all the factors set forth\n\nin Code § 20-107.1(E). The circuit court found that Hornsby’s conclusions, based upon\n\nparameters provided by husband, did not assist it in understanding testimony or determining any\n\nfactual issue and therefore it declined to give any weight to his testimony in making its\n\ndetermination. The “credibility of the expert witness and the weight to be accorded the\n\nevidence” is a matter exclusively in the province of the factfinder, in this case the circuit court,\n\nand is not ordinarily subject to appellate review. See Lemond v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App.\n\n687, 694, 454 S.E.2d 31, 35 (1995). Consequently, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin refusing to give any weight to Hornsby’s testimony.\n\n                                         E. Attorney’s Fees\n\n       Husband’s final assignment of error is that the circuit court abused its discretion in\n\nawarding wife $50,000 in attorney’s fees. Husband simply argues that because the circuit court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees was based on its finding that wife substantially prevailed in the litigation\n\nby obtaining a spousal support award, if this Court reverses the judgment below then it should\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fdirect the circuit court to revisit its award of attorney’s fees. Because we find no error in the\n\njudgment of the circuit court, we need not consider this issue further.\n\n        Wife asks this Court to award her attorney’s fees necessary for the defense of this appeal.\n\nWe grant wife’s request in part.\n\n                “The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to\n                determine the propriety of an award of attorney’s fees for efforts\n                expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the\n                opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine\n                whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for\n                requiring additional payment.”\n\nBrandau, 52 Va. App. at 642, 666 S.E.2d at 537-38 (quoting O’Loughlin v. O’Loughlin, 23\n\nVa. App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996)). With respect to husband’s second through sixth\n\nassignments of error, we conclude that those arguments are “not fairly debatable under any\n\nreasonable construction of the record or the governing legal principles.” Id. at 642, 666 S.E.2d at\n\n538. However, we conclude that husband’s first assignment of error though ultimately\n\nunpersuasive, was nonetheless fairly debatable. See id. at 643, 666 S.E.2d at 538. Therefore, we\n\nremand this case to the circuit court solely for the purpose of determining appropriate appellate\n\nattorney’s fees and costs associated with her defense of this appeal with the exception of those\n\nrelated to husband’s first assignment of error.\n\n                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court as to all issues\n\non appeal and remand solely for a determination of an appropriate award of attorney’s fees and\n\ncosts related to this appeal.\n\n                                                                            Affirmed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 15 -\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n        Husband and wife were married in 1990. When the parties married, husband was a\n\nCaptain in the Army and wife was an Army nurse. The deCamps had three children—born in\n\n1992, 1995, and 1999. After the birth of their first child, by mutual agreement of the parties,\n\nwife stopped working and became a homemaker and the children’s primary caregiver. Wife has\n\nnever had a full-time job outside the home after leaving the Army in 1992. During the course of\n\nthe marriage, the deCamps moved eight times due to husband’s military orders. In July of 2003,\n\nthe family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia where husband became an adjunct professor of\n\nmilitary science at the College of William and Mary. In 2005, husband retired from the Army as\n\na Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n        Upon separation, the parties drafted a separation agreement dated January 18, 2013.\n\nRegarding the items on which the parties disagreed, they agreed to refer those issues to a Judge\n\npro tempore for a decision based on Code § 20-107.3.\n\n        The circuit court found that because husband only made approximately $7,200 per year in\n\nhis position as an adjunct professor, he was voluntarily underemployed and imputed $43,000 in\n\nannual income for spousal and child support determinations. At the time of the parties’\n\nseparation, husband has several other sources of significant wealth. The circuit court found that\n\nbased on husband’s trust income, imputed trust income, imputed voluntary underemployment\n\nincome, disability pay, and retirement pay, his gross monthly income for the purposes of\n\ncalculating child and spousal support was $31,219. The circuit court refused to impute any\n\n                                               -2-\n\fincome to wife on the basis that husband failed to present any evidence of a present job and\n\nsalary amount available to wife.\n\n       Having considered the statutory factors pursuant to Code § 20-107.1(E), the circuit court\n\nordered husband to pay wife $7,000 per month, beginning on April 1, 2014 and continuing until\n\neither party dies or wife remarries or cohabits with another person for more than a year. At the\n\nparties’ joint request, the circuit court awarded wife child support pursuant to the statutory\n\nguidelines in the amount of $734 per month.\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n                       A. Children’s Expenses and Spousal Support Award\n\n       Husband first argues that the circuit court erred by “including expenses attributable to the\n\nparties’ children in its award of spousal support to Wife, in addition to child support in the\n\namount of $734 per month for the two minor children award pursuant to Code 20-108.2, and by\n\nfailing to assign the burden of proof on that issue to Wife as the party seeking spousal support.”\n\nParsing out this compound assignment of error, we presume husband essentially argues that the\n\ncircuit court’s error is twofold: (1) it erred by failing to place the burden of proving separate\n\nspousal needs on the party seeking it, in this case wife; and (2) it erred again by failing to\n\nexclude the children’s expenses from wife’s spousal support award. In support of his argument,\n\nhusband relies on this Court’s decision in Robbins v. Robbins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1063200\"><a href=\"/opinion/1063200/robbins-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1063200\"><a href=\"/opinion/1063200/robbins-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2006), as setting forth the “controlling rules of law” applicable to this issue. Despite husband’s\n\narguments to the contrary, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion under the\n\ncurrent law as explained in Robbins.\n\n       In Robbins, the wife, the party seeking spousal support, argued that the circuit court\n\nabused its discretion by adopting the commissioner’s method for calculating the wife’s spousal\n\nsupport award—deducting her child support award from her estimated financial needs. The\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fcommissioner based his reasoning on the fact that he could not determine what part of the wife’s\n\nclaimed expenses were attributable exclusively to the care of the minor child. Id. at 483, 632\n\nS.E.2d at 624. In reversing the judgment of the circuit court, this Court explained that “[s]pousal\n\nsupport and child support represent two distinct remedies directed at two very different interests:\n\nthe spouse’s needs and the child’s needs.” Id. at 484, 632 S.E.2d at 624. Thus, collapsing the\n\ntwo awards together into an aggregate award “constitutes an abuse of discretion as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Id. The party seeking spousal support pursuant to Code § 20-107.1 bears the burden of\n\nproving all the facts necessary for an award, “including evidence of financial need reasonably\n\nseparate from the needs of others from whom the party paying support either owes no obligation\n\nor will be satisfying that obligation, if owed, by other means.”2 Id. However, this Court\n\nexplained in dicta that,\n\n               Expenses that are indivisible by nature or trivial in amount need\n               not be segregated. While Code § 20-107.1(E)(1) requires the\n               consideration of the “needs” of the “parties,” the statute does not\n               (as the child support statute does) create a mathematical formula\n               primarily reliant on the input of financial data. Instead,\n               § 20-107.1(E) requires only the factfinder to “consider” the\n               estimated needs of the parties. By doing so, the statute thus\n               authorizes a flexible, commonsense approach to this aspect of the\n               factfinding exercise.\n\nId. at 484 n.10, 632 S.E.2d at 624 n.10 (emphasis added).\n\n       In this case, unlike in Robbins, the circuit court did not improperly relieve wife of her\n\nburden of proving her separate financial need, nor did it collapse husband’s spousal and child\n\nsupport obligations into an aggregate award.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The Court supported this conclusion by pointing to the fact that child support\nobligations calculated according to the statutory guidelines already contemplate the amount of\nspousal support awarded to the custodial parent. In other words, “[t]he very use of the spousal\nsupport award as an income enhancement to the payee spouse recognizes the payee’s own duty\nof support to her minor child.” Robbins, 48 Va. App. at 485, 632 S.E.2d at 624.\n                                                -4-\n\f       This Court held that the wife in Robbins had the burden of proving her own financial\n\nneeds separate from those expenses attributable to the support of the parties’ minor child—which\n\nwas a separate obligation of the husband satisfied through his child support payments. Id. at\n\n484-85, 632 S.E.2d at 624. The wife conceded that some of her listed expenses included some\n\nitems attributable exclusively to the children. This case is factually distinguishable from\n\nRobbins because wife only purported to claim her individual monthly expenses. Throughout the\n\ncourse of the proceedings, wife submitted several revised income and expense statements. One\n\ndraft listed $9,991.24 as her individual monthly expenses and $680 under the section titled\n\n“Children Expenses.” However, her last draft, dated August 26, 2013, listed $8,160.76 as her\n\nindividual monthly expenses and included nothing under “Children Expenses.” When asked\n\nunder oath why she had shown no expenses under the “Children Expenses” category in her final\n\ndraft, wife responded that in “[d]oing this new income and expense statement I was advised by\n\n[counsel] that those are children’s expenses and not my expenses so they should not be\n\nincluded.”\n\n       Because wife’s estimated expense statement facially included only those expenses\n\nattributable to herself, wife met her burden of proffering evidence that supported her individual\n\nmonthly expenses. Therefore, as the factfinder, the circuit court was then free to consider and\n\nweigh the evidence of her estimated needs, and award spousal support within its discretion.\n\n       In applying that discretion, the circuit court concluded that some of wife’s claimed\n\nexpenses did indeed include expenses attributable to the children such as Internet service fees,\n\nutilities, and food, however those expenses were either indivisible by their nature as noted in the\n\ndicta in Robbins or were reduced by the circuit court to exclude what the circuit court considered\n\nnon-spousal expenses. In explaining its ruling, the circuit court specifically found that both\n\nhusband and wife “included costs in some of their monthly expenses which are attributable to the\n\n                                               -5-\n\fchildren,” however “such costs were not subject to calculation.” The circuit court further noted\n\nthat it was “not aware, nor have the parties suggested any method through which a spouse could\n\ncalculate a child’s use of electricity, gas/heating oil, water/sewer, and auto repairs.” As to some\n\nof wife’s other claimed expenses, the circuit court adjusted those expenses that were subject to\n\ndivisibility on the basis that they were exaggerated or included the needs of her children. For\n\nexample, the circuit court reduced her estimated monthly grocery and dining out expenditures\n\nbecause it believed “Wife included her individual needs [with] the food needs of her children.”\n\n       In sum, the circuit court acknowledged, echoing the dicta language in Robbins, that there\n\nare some monthly expenses that are indivisible by their very nature. Finding no error in the\n\ncircuit court’s judgment, we expressly adopt as our holding here the dicta in Robbins that\n\n“[e]xpenses that are indivisible by nature or trivial in amount need not be segregated.” Id. at 484\n\nn.10, 632 S.E.2d at 624 n.10. With respect to any divisible expenses, the record here reflects that\n\nthe circuit court properly considered the estimated needs of wife and reduced her claimed\n\nindividual expenses where it believed the children’s expenses had been included in her\n\nestimations. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by failing to award a\n\nseparate and distinct spousal support award that did not include the needs of the parties’ children.\n\n                             B. Expert Testimony of Gray Broughton\n\n       Husband argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by excluding the expert\n\ntestimony of Gray Broughton (“Broughton”), which supplemented his earlier report on current\n\nnursing jobs available to wife. This Court will not overturn a circuit court’s exercise of its\n\ndiscretion in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence unless the record demonstrates\n\nthat it abused its discretion.

Broughton included in his report eight potential nursing\n\npositions he believed suitable for wife. This report was disclosed to wife’s counsel in\n\naccordance with the pretrial scheduling order. The pretrial scheduling order required that the\n\nparties complete discovery 30 days before trial. It also required that counsel exchange a list and\n\ncopies of all exhibits that were going to be introduced 15 days before trial. Trial was estimated\n\nby the parties to last two days and was set for September 11 and 12, 2013.\n\n       The trial began as scheduled on September 11, 2013. Wife presented her evidence for the\n\nfull two days estimated for the entire trial. Due to a scheduling issue, the circuit court set the\n\ntrial to reconvene on October 17 and 18, 2013 for the presentation of husband’s evidence. On\n\nSeptember 27, 2013, husband provided wife with an updated copy of Broughton’s report, listing\n\nfifteen new job opportunities suitable for wife. On October 17, 2013, when Broughton was\n\ncalled to testify about his findings in the September 27th report, wife’s counsel objected on the\n\ngrounds that the amended report violated the scheduling order. Broughton conceded that he had\n\ndone research on the current job market after the start of the trial on September 11, 2013.\n\n       The circuit court found that “it would be grossly inappropriate . . . to allow him to testify\n\nany differently than he would have testified had he been called on one of the days that we had set\n\nfor trial.” Consequently, the judge prohibited Broughton from testifying “to anything he had not\n\nyet prepared prior to September 11th and 12th.” However, the judge noted that on the issue of\n\nwhether the information provided was “stale” he would look at it “as if it was tried all at the\n\nsame time.” During the hearing on husband’s motion to reconsider, the judge reiterated that “I\n\nwant the record to state that one of the reasons that the, that 15 of those jobs were not allowed is\n\nthat they were, in my opinion, in violation of the pretrial order.”3\n\n       3\n         Wife asserts that husband’s argument was not properly preserved because he never\nproffered the disputed September 26, 2013 report. Wife is correct that an aggrieved party must\nmake a proffer of the excluded testimony to preserve a ruling for appellate review. See\nGalumbeck v.

The circuit court concluded and we agree that it would\n\nhave been fundamentally unfair to allow husband to offer evidence that wife was wholly\n\nunaware of until after she had rested her case.

Three of the statutory\n\nfactors are directly pertinent to the question of imputation: “‘earning capacity, including the\n\nskills, education and training of the parties and the present employment opportunities for persons\n\npossessing such earning capacity;’” “‘opportunity for, ability of, and the time and costs involved\n\nfor a party to acquire the appropriate education, training and employment to obtain the skills\n\nneeded to enhance his or her earning ability;’” and “‘decisions regarding employment, career,\n\neconomics, education and parenting arrangements made by the parties during the marriage and\n\ntheir effect on present and future earning potential, including the length of time one or both of\n\nthe parties have been absent from the job market.’” Id. at 638, 666 S.E.2d at 536 (quoting Code\n\n§ 20-107.1(E)(9), (10), (11)).

App. at 734, 396\n\nS.E.2d at 679. However, so long as the spouse seeking support has not “unreasonably refused to\n\naccept employment,” the spouse is “entitled to a reasonable time to secure employment.” Id. In\n\nBrandau, this Court affirmatively rejected the proposition that there is a statutory preset requiring\n\nthe imputation of income to a spouse seeking support if she has provable earning capacity at the\n\ntime of divorce. 52 Va.

In fact, this Court noted that “[n]either\n\nSrinivasan nor any other Virginia case has held that, for purposes of calculating spousal support,\n\na stay-at-home spouse capable of working must go to work immediately after the divorce trial or\n\nface a judicially imposed imputation of income.” Id. at 640, 666 S.E.2d at 536. To the contrary,\n\nVirginia cases imputing income “involved spouses who worked during the marriage but,\n\nsometime after separation, either accepted a job beneath their earning capacity or stopped\n\nworking altogether.” Id. In Brandau, this Court affirmed the circuit court’s refusal to impute\n\nincome to the wife because there were credible reasons to support its determination that\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fimputation was inappropriate in light of the conditions that existed at the time of the final decree.\n\nId. at 641, 666 S.E.2d at 537.\n\n         In this case, husband argues that the trial court erred in refusing to impute income to wife\n\nbecause she is voluntarily unemployed. Specifically, he argues that the circuit court’s decision to\n\ndecline to impute income to wife because husband failed to introduce evidence of jobs that were\n\ncurrently available to wife was in error because: (1) the circuit court’s exclusion of Broughton’s\n\ntestimony made that task impossible; and (2) there was undisputed evidence in the record that the\n\ndemand for nursing jobs was rising and jobs become available on a daily, weekly, and monthly\n\nbasis.\n\n         Wife had not worked full time outside the home since 1992. Wife did briefly work part\n\ntime as a substitute school nurse in late 2011 and early 2012 as well as an assistant soccer coach\n\nin 2011. In 1996, she had back surgery that has had a significant impact on her physical\n\nmobility. Medical experts testified that the kind of employment she could perform was limited\n\ndue to the physical tasks required for many nursing jobs. Broughton testified as to eight\n\npositions which he opined were “reasonable in distance from Wife’s home and would\n\naccommodate her physical limitations.” However, Broughton conceded that to his knowledge\n\nnone of those jobs were still available. The circuit court found that it was “constrained to find\n\nthat Husband has failed to offer any evidence of a present job position for Wife,” because\n\nBroughton “could not testify as to any jobs which were available.”\n\n         In this case, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in declining to impute income to\n\nwife. As the party seeking to impute income, husband had the burden of proving that wife was\n\nvoluntarily forgoing employment. He was “required to present evidence ‘sufficient to enable the\n\ntrial judge reasonably to project what amount [of income] could be anticipated.’” McKee, 52\n\nVa. App. at 490, 664 S.E.2d at 510 (quoting Joynes, 36 Va. App. at 421, 551 S.E.2d at 20). The\n\n                                                 - 11 -\n\fcircuit court found that he failed to do so. Husband presented one expert witness, and the circuit\n\ncourt found that witness’ testimony was insufficient to establish at the time of divorce what jobs\n\nwere available to her and what income she could potentially earn.4\n\n       In analyzing husband’s assignments of error in this regard, we initially note that the law\n\ndoes not require wife return to work immediately upon divorce to avoid judicial imputation of\n\nincome merely because she has provable earning capacity at the time of the divorce. Brandau,\n\n52 Va. App. at 639, 666 S.E.2d at 536. Rather, any decision to impute income must be done\n\nwithin a review of all the statutory factors concerning spousal support. In determining wife’s\n\nspousal support award the circuit court wrote an exhaustive report detailing consideration of all\n\nrelevant factors as required pursuant to Code § 20-107.1(E). Husband had significant financial\n\nresources. He was the sole monetary contributor to the marriage for its entire duration. By\n\nmutual agreement of the parties, wife left her nursing career in 1992 and became a full-time\n\nhomemaker and caregiver to their three children. Over the course of their twenty-one-year\n\nmarriage, wife moved eight times with husband due to his military career. The circuit court\n\nfound that wife’s nonmonetary contribution allowed husband to pursue and advance in his\n\nmilitary career.\n\n       In sum, based on the evidence before the circuit court, we cannot find that the circuit\n\ncourt abused its discretion by declining to impute income to wife because there are credible\n\nreasons in the record to support its determination that imputation was inappropriate in light of the\n\nconditions that existed at the time of the final decree.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          The circuit court noted that it did not find that wife should not go to work at some point\nor that she was not capable of finding employment. Rather, the circuit court stated at the hearing\non husband’s motion to reconsider that the issue was that husband’s expert failed to provide a\npotential income that the court could impute to wife.\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f        Husband’s third assignment of error contends that the circuit court erred by failing to\n\nimpute delayed income to wife no more than six months after the entry of its initial order. Less\n\nthan thirty days after the entry of the final decree, husband filed a motion for reconsideration\n\nrequesting that the circuit court impute income to wife in the amount equal to halfway between\n\nBroughton’s highest and lowest estimated salaries, effective no more than six months after entry\n\nof the circuit court’s order. In his motion, husband argued that “[s]ix months is a more than\n\nreasonable time for a person with Wife’s qualifications to secure full-time employment in the\n\nPeninsula market.”\n\n        The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying husband’s request for delayed\n\nimputation of income for the same reasons as stated above. In support of his motion husband\n\npresented no additional evidence, therefore the circuit court’s determination was identical to its\n\ninitial determination. The circuit court reiterated its finding that Broughton did not give “the\n\nnecessary testimony to establish a job that was available or the amount of money that she could\n\nearn in that job.”\n\n                             D. Expert Testimony of Robert Hornsby\n\n        Husband argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to credit the\n\ntestimony of Robert Hornsby (“Hornsby”), a qualified expert in real estate sales in Williamsburg,\n\nVirginia regarding the availability and cost of housing for wife. Hornsby testified that his task\n\nwas to find a home that would be appropriate for wife considering her “stature in the\n\ncommunity” within a price range of $205,000 to $325,000. Hornsby stated that husband\n\nprovided all his search parameters including price, square footage, and number of bedrooms and\n\nbathrooms.\n\n        Citing John v.

The Supreme Court in John explained that “expert\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\ftestimony generally is admissible if it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence.\n\nId. at 319, 559 S.E.2d at 696. “The decision whether to admit such testimony is a matter\n\ncommitted to the trial judge’s sound discretion,” and will be reversed “only when the court has\n\nabused its discretion.” Id. at 320, 559 S.E.2d at 696.\n\n       Here, the testimony was admitted into evidence unobjected to, however the circuit court\n\nrefused to give it any weight for the same reasons it could have excluded the testimony to begin\n\nwith—because it had no probative value. The circuit court found that the facts testified to by\n\nHornsby originated solely from husband and were not based upon any facts established by the\n\nother evidence in the record or the statutory considerations. Specifically, the value of wife’s\n\nprospective home was an ultimate issue in this case and that issue was dependent upon husband’s\n\nability to pay, the standard of living established during the marriage, and all the factors set forth\n\nin Code § 20-107.1(E). The circuit court found that Hornsby’s conclusions, based upon\n\nparameters provided by husband, did not assist it in understanding testimony or determining any\n\nfactual issue and therefore it declined to give any weight to his testimony in making its\n\ndetermination. The “credibility of the expert witness and the weight to be accorded the\n\nevidence” is a matter exclusively in the province of the factfinder, in this case the circuit court,\n\nand is not ordinarily subject to appellate review.

Consequently, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin refusing to give any weight to Hornsby’s testimony.\n\n                                         E. Attorney’s Fees\n\n       Husband’s final assignment of error is that the circuit court abused its discretion in\n\nawarding wife $50,000 in attorney’s fees. Husband simply argues that because the circuit court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees was based on its finding that wife substantially prevailed in the litigation\n\nby obtaining a spousal support award, if this Court reverses the judgment below then it should\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fdirect the circuit court to revisit its award of attorney’s fees. Because we find no error in the\n\njudgment of the circuit court, we need not consider this issue further.\n\n        Wife asks this Court to award her attorney’s fees necessary for the defense of this appeal.\n\nWe grant wife’s request in part.\n\n                “The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to\n                determine the propriety of an award of attorney’s fees for efforts\n                expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the\n                opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine\n                whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for\n                requiring additional payment.”\n\nBrandau, 52 Va. App. at 642, 666 S.E.2d at 537-38 (quoting O’Loughlin v. O’Loughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Va.

With respect to husband’s second through sixth\n\nassignments of error, we conclude that those arguments are “not fairly debatable under any\n\nreasonable construction of the record or the governing legal principles.” Id. at 642, 666 S.E.2d at\n\n538. However, we conclude that husband’s first assignment of error though ultimately\n\nunpersuasive, was nonetheless fairly debatable. See id. at 643, 666 S.E.2d at 538. Therefore, we\n\nremand this case to the circuit court solely for the purpose of determining appropriate appellate\n\nattorney’s fees and costs associated with her defense of this appeal with the exception of those\n\nrelated to husband’s first assignment of error.\n\n                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court as to all issues\n\non appeal and remand solely for a determination of an appropriate award of attorney’s fees and\n\ncosts related to this appeal.\n\n                                                                            Affirmed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 15 -\n\f</pre>",
