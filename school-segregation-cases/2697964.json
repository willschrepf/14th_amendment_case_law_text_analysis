The district court then held a jury trial on PPI's counterclaims\r\nand rendered judgment on the verdict that Onca was liable to PPI for $220,516.27 for\r\nexpenses related to a separate agreement (the \"Guatemalan concessions\") and\r\n$73,645.43 for undisclosed liabilities in a stock purchase agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter calculating prejudgment interest, the district court held that Onca's net\r\nrecovery from PPI was $14,828.57.  The district court held a hearing on attorney's\r\nfees and awarded Onca $99,888.00 ($25,388.00 for the summary judgment and\r\n$78,500.00 for trial), giving it a total judgement of $114,715.57.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPPI brings seven issues claiming the district court erred in: (1) rendering a\r\npartial summary judgment; (2) rendering summary judgment when a fact issue\r\nexisted; (3) rejecting newly discovered evidence of a tendered payment;\r\n(4)Â submitting Onca's liability for the \"Guatemalan concession\" to the jury as that\r\nliability was established as a matter of law; (5) not finding that Onca and PPI were\r\nin a partnership; (6) not segregating attorney's fees; and (7) awarding excessive\r\nattorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, PPI claims the district court erred in rendering summary judgment\r\nonly on Onca's claims as to the consulting agreement.  PPI argues without citation to\r\nauthority that it was somehow deprived of notice that Onca was alternately seeking\r\na partial summary judgment.  PPI did not preserve this issue by objecting below, and\r\nwe hold it has waived any potential error.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue two, PPI claims the district court erred in rendering the partial\r\nsummary judgment because there was a fact issue regarding damages.  Onca's\r\nsummary-judgment evidence was that PPI withheld $234,000 in required payments\r\nunder the consulting agreement, but PPI's summary-judgment evidence was that PPI\r\nwithheld $252,000.  PPI in essence argues that the summary-judgment evidence\r\nsuggests that PPI owed $18,000.00 more than the district court awarded.  PPI,\r\ntherefore, concedes the damages were at least $234,000.  PPI cannot complain of\r\nerrors that do not affect it, and we overrule issue two.  <em>See</em> <em>Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist.\r\nv. Glaser</em>, 632 S.W.2d 146, 150 (Tex. 1982).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue three, PPI claims the district court erred by not granting a new trial\r\nbased on newly discovered evidence that PPI sent a January 2004 $13,483.74 check\r\nto Onca that Onca never cashed.  PPI's motion for new trial contained the affidavit\r\nof Randy Sullivan, PPI's chief executive officer, in which Sullivan explained that he\r\nwas \"considerably hampered in my post-verdict investigation by the fact that the\r\nsingle corporate officer most familiar with the payments made by PPI to Onca and\r\ntheir underlying calculation, PPI's former Chief Financial Officer Phil Cook, was no\r\nlonger with PPI.\"  Sullivan went on to say that \"to the best of my knowledge after\r\nreasonable inquiry within PPI, no one employed by PPI in January 2006 was in any\r\nway aware of the uncashed January 2004 check.  With Mr. Cook no longer being at\r\nthe company in January 2006, and under the time pressures involved in preparing our\r\nresponse, PPI's counsel and I also reasonably relied to some extent on [a witness's]\r\nassertion that PPI had made no monthly payments since December 2003.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party who seeks a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence\r\nmust demonstrate to the trial court that (1) the evidence has come to the party's\r\nknowledge since the trial, (2) the evidence was not discovered earlier because of a\r\nlack of due diligence, (3) the evidence is not cumulative, and (4) the evidence is so\r\nmaterial that it would probably produce a different result if a new trial were granted. \r\n<em>Jackson v. Van Winkle</em>, 660 S.W.2d 807, 809 (Tex. 1983), <em>overruled on other\r\ngrounds by</em> <em>Moritz v. Preiss</em>, 121 S.W.3d 715, 720-21 (Tex. 2003).  On appeal, the\r\nissue is whether the trial court's refusal of a new trial involves the violation of a clear\r\nlegal right or a manifest abuse of judicial discretion.  <em>Jackson</em>, 660 S.W.2d at 809.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOnca points out that Cook testified at trial about the January 2004 check. \r\nFurthermore, PPI's motion for new trial does not demonstrate why PPI could not have\r\ndiscovered the check before trial, since PPI found the check later.  Based on this\r\nrecord, we cannot say that the district court's refusal of the motion for new trial\r\nviolated a clear legal right or was a manifest abuse of judicial discretion.  We overrule\r\nissue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue four, PPI claims the district court erred in submitting Onca's liability\r\nfor the \"Guatemalan concession\" to the jury as that liability was established as a\r\nmatter of law by a January 27, 2007 assignment agreement.  PPI's total argument in\r\nits brief consists of quoting one line from the assignment<sup> (1)</sup> and the declaration, \"That\r\nis a plain and unambiguous contractual obligation.\"  This issue is overruled as PPI\r\nhas not provided any substantive briefing, including any citation to relevant authority. \r\n<em>See</em> <em>Harris County Mun. Util. Dist. No. 48 v. Mitchell</em>, 915 S.W.2d 859, 866 &amp; n.15\r\n(Tex. App.--Houston 1995, writ denied) (discussing failure to adequately brief).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue five, PPI contends the district court erred in not granting a judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict and holding that Onca and PPI were in a 50/50\r\npartnership.  PPI is therefore challenging the jury verdict that Onca owed\r\n$146,870.84 out of the total \"Guatemalan concessions\" expenses of $587,483.35,\r\nwhich is 25% of the total expenses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn order to demonstrate that Onca owed 50% of the total \"Guatemalan\r\nconcessions\" expenses as a matter of law, we must first examine the record for\r\nevidence that supports the jury's damage finding, while ignoring all evidence to the\r\ncontrary.  <em>See</em> <em>Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co.</em>, 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex. 1989).  If we\r\ndetermine there is no evidence to support the jury's finding, we then must examine\r\nthe entire record to determine if the contrary proposition is established as a matter of\r\nlaw.\"  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its brief, PPI does not discuss evidence that supports the jury's finding. \r\nThere is evidence in the record in which Onca's president expresses his\r\nunderstanding to other parties that Onca had a 25% interest in the \"Guatemalan\r\nconcessions.\"  Because it does not address the matter, PPI makes no argument why\r\nthis evidence has no legal significance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule issue five.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue six, PPI argues the district court erred in awarding $74,500 in\r\nattorney's fees to Onca for the trial in which the jury found that Onca was liable to\r\nPPI in the amount of $146,870.84 for expenses related to the \"Guatemalan\r\nconcessions\" and $73,645.43 for undisclosed liabilities in a stock purchase\r\nagreement.  PPI cites the recent opinion in <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, in\r\nwhich the supreme court makes it clear that if any attorney's fees relate solely to a\r\nclaim for which fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\r\nunrecoverable fees.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P.</em>, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPPI attempted to get Onca's lawyer to segregate the attorney's fees for trial\r\nfrom any issues specifically related to the breach of the consulting agreement.  Onca's\r\nlawyer did not segregate, claiming that Onca's position \"is that the issues are\r\ninterrelated.\"  While PPI did not formally object during the hearing on attorney's fees,\r\nPPI did specifically object in its supplemental motion for new trial to Onca's failure\r\nto segregation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Tony Gullo</em>, the supreme court explained that \"to prevail on a contract claim\r\na party must overcome any and all affirmative defenses (such as limitations, <em>res\r\njudicata</em>, or prior material breach), and the opposing party who raises them should not\r\nbe allowed to suggest to the jury that overcoming those defenses was unnecessary.\" \r\n<em>Id.</em> at 314.  When a defendant asserts a counterclaim that the plaintiff must overcome\r\nin order to fully recover on its contract claim, the attorney's fees necessary to defeat\r\nthat counterclaim are likewise recoverable.  <em>See</em> <em>Varner v. Cardenas</em>, 218 S.W.3d 68,\r\n69 (Tex. 2007) (per curiam).  Thus, under certain circumstances, attorney's fees\r\nincurred in defending against a counterclaim in a breach-of-contract case will not\r\nneed to be segregated.  <em>See</em> <em>7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent A Car Sys.,\r\nInc.</em>, 245 S.W.3d 488, 507 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied)\r\n(holding that no segregation was necessary because plaintiff had to defeat defendant's\r\ncounterclaim before plaintiff could recover on its own breach-of-contract claim).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, in this case, Onca did not successfully defend against PPI's\r\ncounterclaim.  PPI received a jury verdict against Onca, which the district court offset\r\nagainst Onca's partial summary judgment against PPI.  As such, Onca cannot say that\r\nits defense of PPI's counterclaims was necessary to fully recover on its contract\r\nclaim.  Because Onca did not successfully defend against PPI's counterclaims, it\r\nshould have been required to segregate its attorney's fees.  <em>See</em> <em>Bair Chase Prop. Co.,\r\nLLC v. S &amp; K Dev. Co.</em>, 260 S.W.3d 133, 145 (Tex. App.--Austin 2008, pet. filed)\r\n(holding that segregation of attorney's fees required because plaintiff did not\r\nsuccessfully defend against usury counterclaim; it instead took corrective action to\r\navoid liability for usury).  Put simply, Onca cannot recover attorney's fees incurred\r\nin the defense of a counterclaim on which it did not prevail.  Onca should have been\r\nrequired to segregate the attorney's fees that it incurred in prosecuting its\r\nbreach-of-contract claim from those that it incurred in unsuccessfully defending PPI's\r\ncounterclaim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain issue six.  In light of this disposition, we do not reach issue seven,\r\nin which PPI argues the attorney's fees award was excessive.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe reverse the judgment in part regarding the award of $74,500 in attorney's\r\nfees to Onca for the trial, affirm the remaining portions of the judgment, and remand\r\nthe case to the district court for further proceedings limited to determining Onca's\r\nrecoverable attorney's fees, if any, for the jury trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tSam Nuchia</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Nuchia and Higley.\r\n<p>1. \t\"Assignor does hereby assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Assignee, and\r\nAssignee does hereby acquire and assume, fifty percent (50%) of all of\r\nAssignor's obligations, rights, title and interest in and to all properties, assets,\r\ncontracts, agreements, understandings, prepaid expenses, and rights . . . .\"</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Mitchell</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469574\"><a href=\"/opinion/2469574/harris-mun-utility-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span>, 866 &amp; n.15\r\n(Tex. App.--Houston 1995, writ denied) (discussing failure to adequately brief).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue five, PPI contends the district court erred in not granting a judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict and holding that Onca and PPI were in a 50/50\r\npartnership.  PPI is therefore challenging the jury verdict that Onca owed\r\n$146,870.84 out of the total \"Guatemalan concessions\" expenses of $587,483.35,\r\nwhich is 25% of the total expenses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn order to demonstrate that Onca owed 50% of the total \"Guatemalan\r\nconcessions\" expenses as a matter of law, we must first examine the record for\r\nevidence that supports the jury's damage finding, while ignoring all evidence to the\r\ncontrary.  <em>See</em> <em>Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2451326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2451326/sterner-v-marathon-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 690 (Tex. 1989).  If we\r\ndetermine there is no evidence to support the jury's finding, we then must examine\r\nthe entire record to determine if the contrary proposition is established as a matter of\r\nlaw.\"  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its brief, PPI does not discuss evidence that supports the jury's finding. \r\nThere is evidence in the record in which Onca's president expresses his\r\nunderstanding to other parties that Onca had a 25% interest in the \"Guatemalan\r\nconcessions.\"  Because it does not address the matter, PPI makes no argument why\r\nthis evidence has no legal significance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule issue five.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue six, PPI argues the district court erred in awarding $74,500 in\r\nattorney's fees to Onca for the trial in which the jury found that Onca was liable to\r\nPPI in the amount of $146,870.84 for expenses related to the \"Guatemalan\r\nconcessions\" and $73,645.43 for undisclosed liabilities in a stock purchase\r\nagreement.  PPI cites the recent opinion in <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, in\r\nwhich the supreme court makes it clear that if any attorney's fees relate solely to a\r\nclaim for which fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\r\nunrecoverable fees.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 313-14 (Tex. 2006). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPPI attempted to get Onca's lawyer to segregate the attorney's fees for trial\r\nfrom any issues specifically related to the breach of the consulting agreement.  Onca's\r\nlawyer did not segregate, claiming that Onca's position \"is that the issues are\r\ninterrelated.\"  While PPI did not formally object during the hearing on attorney's fees,\r\nPPI did specifically object in its supplemental motion for new trial to Onca's failure\r\nto segregation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Tony Gullo</em>, the supreme court explained that \"to prevail on a contract claim\r\na party must overcome any and all affirmative defenses (such as limitations, <em>res\r\njudicata</em>, or prior material breach), and the opposing party who raises them should not\r\nbe allowed to suggest to the jury that overcoming those defenses was unnecessary.\" \r\n<em>Id.</em> at 314.  When a defendant asserts a counterclaim that the plaintiff must overcome\r\nin order to fully recover on its contract claim, the attorney's fees necessary to defeat\r\nthat counterclaim are likewise recoverable.  <em>See</em> <em>Varner v. Cardenas</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894828\"><a href=\"/opinion/894828/varner-v-cardenas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>,\r\n69 (Tex. 2007) (per curiam).  Thus, under certain circumstances, attorney's fees\r\nincurred in defending against a counterclaim in a breach-of-contract case will not\r\nneed to be segregated.  <em>See</em> <em>7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent A Car Sys.,\r\nInc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1656899\"><a href=\"/opinion/1656899/7979-airport-garage-llc-v-dollar-rent-a-car-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 507 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied)\r\n(holding that no segregation was necessary because plaintiff had to defeat defendant's\r\ncounterclaim before plaintiff could recover on its own breach-of-contract claim).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, in this case, Onca did not successfully defend against PPI's\r\ncounterclaim.  PPI received a jury verdict against Onca, which the district court offset\r\nagainst Onca's partial summary judgment against PPI.  As such, Onca cannot say that\r\nits defense of PPI's counterclaims was necessary to fully recover on its contract\r\nclaim.  Because Onca did not successfully defend against PPI's counterclaims, it\r\nshould have been required to segregate its attorney's fees.  <em>See</em> <em>Bair Chase Prop. Co.,\r\nLLC v. S &amp; K Dev. Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1875809\"><a href=\"/opinion/1875809/bair-chase-property-co-v-s-k-devel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 145 (Tex. App.--Austin 2008, pet. filed)\r\n(holding that segregation of attorney's fees required because plaintiff did not\r\nsuccessfully defend against usury counterclaim; it instead took corrective action to\r\navoid liability for usury).  Put simply, Onca cannot recover attorney's fees incurred\r\nin the defense of a counterclaim on which it did not prevail.  Onca should have been\r\nrequired to segregate the attorney's fees that it incurred in prosecuting its\r\nbreach-of-contract claim from those that it incurred in unsuccessfully defending PPI's\r\ncounterclaim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain issue six.
