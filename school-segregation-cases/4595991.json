Board\n       of Education,      to speed the process      of desegregation\n       of the Houston Independent         School District.       The\n      Defendant District       duly answered the complaint         and\n       the case was called       to trial    on Ray 20, 1957, after\n      which the Court entered         its order on the 15th day\n       of October,    1957, that the Houston Independent           School\n      'District   commence desegregation         on a non-discrlmina-\n       tory basis from and after         such time as necessary\n       arrangements     could be made.\n\n              \"Article     2900a,    Texas Civil     Statutes,    was\n      passed by the Texas Legislature.               This Statute     be-\n      came effective        August 23, 1957, after          which the\n      Houston Independent          School District        has made\n      efforts     to comply therewith.           In order to comply\n      with Article        2900a, the Houston Independent           School\n      District      caused petitions       to be executed       by some\n      87;OOO qualified         electors    residing     in the district,\n      ivhich was far in excess          of the 20$ required        by the\n      Statute.       Thereafter      an election     was held in which\n      the majority        of the qualified       electors    voted not\n      to abolish       the dual public       school    system. In short,\n\fDr.   J.   W. Edgar,   page 2 (WW-931)\n\n\n       the Houston Independent     School District         has done\n       everything     possible to comply with both         State and\n       Federal    law.\n\n              “Thereafter,   on the 12th day of August, 1960,\n       the Federal District     Court issued Its order requir-\n       ing desegregation     in the Houston Independent   School\n       District    commencing in the first   grade.  A copy of\n       said order is attached.\n\n              “Obviously,      the Houston Independent       School\n       District     is confronted      with the dilemma of losing\n       its accreditation        and its Foundation     Program Funds\n       and complying       with the mandate of the Federal Dls-\n       trict    Court.     It should be observed      that the dual\n       public    school    system as such has not been abolished\n       In that there will         remain segregated    systems except\n       for the first       grade in this present      scholastic     year.\n       Moreover,      the Board of Trustees       has not abolished\n       the dual public        sohool   system nor has the Board of\n       Trustees     abolished     allowance   for transfer    out of\n       the district.         In short,    the Federal District      Court\n       rather than the Board of Trustees            has brought about\n       the noncompliance        of the Houston Independent        School\n       District    with Article       2900a.”\n\n          You state that:   “The dual public    school   system as\nsuch has not been abolished   . . .’    It is unnecessary    to pass\nupon that question  in the present   opinion.\n\n            The answer to your question   hinges upon the              construc-\ntion to be accorded   Section 1 of Article    2900a, which             provides\nas follows:\n\n              “That no board of trustees        nor any other\n       school   authority     shall have the right    to abolish\n       the dual public       school system . . . unless by a\n       prior vote of the qualified        electors   residing   in\n       such district      the dual school    system is abolished.”\n\n           Prior to the enactment of Article      2900a, the Supreme\nCourt of the United States had held that racial         discrimination\nin public  education   was violative    of the Constitution      of the\nUnited States.     Brown v. Board of Education,     347U.S. 483,349\nU.S. 294.   However, as the Supreme Court of Texas pointed            out\nin McKinney v. Blankenship,      282 S.W.2d 691, the Court In the\nBrown case did not direct     Immediate and complete      integration\nin all schools.    The Court recognized,    and has since recognized,\n\fDr.   J.   W. Edgar,   page   3 (W-931)\nby a long line of decisions,    that time would be required,    the\nlength of which would be largely    dependent upon local   condi-\ntions,  for the full accomplishment    of Its decree.\n\n             We believe     that a careful     reading    of Article   2900a\nevidences    recognition     by the Legislature       of Texas that hasty\nand precipitate      action   by the school     districts     of the State\nin making the transition         from racially     segregated    to inte-\ngrated schools     could conceivably      Impede the effectiveness         of\nour schools.      The language of the Act furnishes            ample justi-\nfication   for the conclusion        that it was designed       to legally\nachieve   the maximum time for making the transition.\n\n              It is significant         that Section      1, above quoted,\nprovides    that \"no school       board or other school            authority\"\nshall have the right to abolish               the dual system of oublic\nschools.      The pains and penalties            of the Act are evidently\nap licable      only if the dual s stem is abolished                by either:\n(17     the school    board,   or     (27     other school      authority.     The\nAct provides      no penalty     where the dual system is abolished\nby judicial      decree.     This leads us to the question:                By what\nauthority    has the dual system of public               schools    been abolished\nin the Houston Independent           School District?           The school     board\nhas entered no order calling              for abolition      of the dual system.\nIn fact,    the board felt       impelled,       for reasons     it deemed suf-\nficient,    to offer     legal   resistance        to the entry of the order\nwhich was in fact entered           and Is now in the process            of per-\nfecting    an appeal from that order.               In this connection,        It\nIs significant       that Article       2900a provides       no penalty     where\nthe dual system of public           schools      Is abolished      by judicial\ndecree.     Such Is the case here,            and hence we must conclude\nthat the dual system of public               schools   for the Houston Inde-\npendent School District          has not been abolished            by the \"board\nof trustees      or other school        authority,\"      as prescribed      by Ar-\nticle    2900a.\n\n               'Ihis Article    provides     in substance    that any person\nwho violates        the Act will be guilty         of a misdemeanor and shall\nbe fined not less than $100 nor more than $1000.                    Should we\nconstrue     the Act as prohibiting          abolishment    of the dual school\nsystem by judicial         decree,    such as we have here,       it would be\ntantamount to placing          the local     school   board in a legal     dl-\nlemma, with their         prosecution     assured by either      State or\nFederal     authority,     and from which there could be no extraca-\ntion.     If they sought to impede or obstruct              the execution      of\nthe Federal       Court decree the members of the school             board\nwould thereby        render themselves       subject   to contempt by the\nFederal     courts.      On the other hand, If they did not prevent\nexecution      of the decree they would subject            themselves    to a\n\fDr.   J.   W. Edgar,   page 4 (WW-931)\n\n\npossible  fine of not to exceed $1000 under the State law. It\nhas been said that a court will never adopt a construction\nthat . . . will    lead to absurd conclusions   or consequences\nif the language of the enactment is susceptible       of any other\nmeaning.    39 Tex.Jur.,  Statutes,  Section  118,Staples v. State,\n112 Tex. 61,245 S.W. 639; Fenet v. McCuistion,        105 Tex. 299\n147 S.W. 867; Shipley v. Floydada Independent      School District\n(Comm.App.),   250 S.W. 159.\n\n          We believe  that the construction    which we have ac-\ncorded to the statute  is not only in keeping with the actual\nlanguage employed but is calculated    to achieve   the evident\npurpose of the enactment as well.     This conclusion   la in ac-\ncordance with the argument advanced by the Houston School\nBoard.\n\n                                  SUMMARY\n\n              Under the facts    as stated,     the Board of\n       Trustees     of the Houston Independent        School Dis-\n       trict,    or other school     authority,   has not\n       abolished     the dual system of public        schools\n       within the meaning of Artlale          2900a, Vernon's\n       Civil    Statutes,   and hence neither      the school\n       district     nor its trustees     are subject     to the\n       penalties     of said Article.\n\n                                      Yours   very   truly,\n\n                                      WILL WILSON\n                                      Attorney General        of   Texas\n\n\n\n                                  By Leonard Passmore\nLP:dhs                               First  Assistant\n\n\nAPPROVED:\nOPINION COMMITTEE\nW.

The Court recognized,    and has since recognized,\n\fDr.   J.   W. Edgar,   page   3 (W-931)\nby a long line of decisions,    that time would be required,    the\nlength of which would be largely    dependent upon local   condi-\ntions,  for the full accomplishment    of Its decree.\n\n             We believe     that a careful     reading    of Article   2900a\nevidences    recognition     by the Legislature       of Texas that hasty\nand precipitate      action   by the school     districts     of the State\nin making the transition         from racially     segregated    to inte-\ngrated schools     could conceivably      Impede the effectiveness         of\nour schools.      The language of the Act furnishes            ample justi-\nfication   for the conclusion        that it was designed       to legally\nachieve   the maximum time for making the transition.\n\n              It is significant         that Section      1, above quoted,\nprovides    that \"no school       board or other school            authority\"\nshall have the right to abolish               the dual system of oublic\nschools.      The pains and penalties            of the Act are evidently\nap licable      only if the dual s stem is abolished                by either:\n(17     the school    board,   or     (27     other school      authority.     The\nAct provides      no penalty     where the dual system is abolished\nby judicial      decree.     This leads us to the question:                By what\nauthority    has the dual system of public               schools    been abolished\nin the Houston Independent           School District?           The school     board\nhas entered no order calling              for abolition      of the dual system.\nIn fact,    the board felt       impelled,       for reasons     it deemed suf-\nficient,    to offer     legal   resistance        to the entry of the order\nwhich was in fact entered           and Is now in the process            of per-\nfecting    an appeal from that order.               In this connection,        It\nIs significant       that Article       2900a provides       no penalty     where\nthe dual system of public           schools      Is abolished      by judicial\ndecree.     Such Is the case here,            and hence we must conclude\nthat the dual system of public               schools   for the Houston Inde-\npendent School District          has not been abolished            by the \"board\nof trustees      or other school        authority,\"      as prescribed      by Ar-\nticle    2900a.\n\n               'Ihis Article    provides     in substance    that any person\nwho violates        the Act will be guilty         of a misdemeanor and shall\nbe fined not less than $100 nor more than $1000.                    Should we\nconstrue     the Act as prohibiting          abolishment    of the dual school\nsystem by judicial         decree,    such as we have here,       it would be\ntantamount to placing          the local     school   board in a legal     dl-\nlemma, with their         prosecution     assured by either      State or\nFederal     authority,     and from which there could be no extraca-\ntion.     If they sought to impede or obstruct              the execution      of\nthe Federal       Court decree the members of the school             board\nwould thereby        render themselves       subject   to contempt by the\nFederal     courts.      On the other hand, If they did not prevent\nexecution      of the decree they would subject            themselves    to a\n\fDr.   J.   W. Edgar,   page 4 (WW-931)\n\n\npossible  fine of not to exceed $1000 under the State law. It\nhas been said that a court will never adopt a construction\nthat . . . will    lead to absurd conclusions   or consequences\nif the language of the enactment is susceptible       of any other\nmeaning.    39 Tex.Jur.,  Statutes,  Section  118,Staples v.
