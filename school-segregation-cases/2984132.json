Introduction\n\n      On October 23, 2006, a jury adjudged Appellant W esley W ayne Miller to be\n\na violent sexual predator, making him subject to a civil commitment order. By three\n\nseparate indictments filed in August and December 2008, a grand jury indicted\n\fAppellant for the third degree felonies of violating his civil commitment order.1\n\nAppellant filed motions to quash each of the indictments, and he pleaded guilty to\n\neach offense after the trial court denied the motions to quash. In two points,\n\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to quash the August 2008\n\nindictment in Cause Number 1112197D (Appellate Cause Number 02-09-00167-CR)\n\nbecause it does not allege an offense in clear and intelligible terms and by failing to\n\nquash the December 2008 indictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D\n\n(Appellate Cause Numbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR) because they\n\ndo not allege offenses against the law. W e affirm.\n\n                                  II. Background\n\n      A jury convicted Appellant in 1982 of murder and assessed his punishment at\n\ntwenty-five years in prison.     See In re Miller, 262 S.W .3d 877, 881 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 2008, pet. denied), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 156 (2009). Near the\n\nend of Appellant’s twenty-five-year prison term, the State filed a petition for civil\n\ncommitment under the Texas Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act). Id. at 881; see\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.002(7-a), (8)(D) (Vernon 2010). Following\n\na jury trial, the jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant is\n\na sexually violent predator as defined by health and safety code section 841.003.\n\nSee Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.003 (Vernon 2010). The resulting\n\njudgment and civil commitment order required, among other things, that Appellant\n\n\n\n\n      1\n           See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.085 (Vernon 2010).\n\n                                          2\n\f“not contact, or cause to be contacted, in person, by telephone, correspondence, or\n\nby any electronic means, a victim or potential victim of [Appellant], including the\n\ncomplaining witnesses in all cases [in which Appellant] has been charged, convicted,\n\n[or] otherwise committed” and that he “participate in and comply with a specific\n\ncourse of treatment, determined by the Council on Sex Offender Treatment [CSOT].”\n\n      Appellant discharged his underlying twenty-five-year sentence on February 23,\n\n2008, and CSOT assumed sole responsibility for his supervision. Several months\n\nlater, Appellant’s therapist determined that Appellant had violated a condition of his\n\ncivil commitment order and terminated Appellant from the sex offender treatment\n\nprogram. Appellant was then arrested for violating the requirements of his civil\n\ncommitment order, transferred to the Tarrant County jail, classified as a maximum\n\nsecurity inmate, and placed in administrative segregation.\n\n      On August 1, 2008, a grand jury indicted Appellant for violating the\n\nrequirements of his civil commitment order in May 2008 by failing to comply with the\n\ncourse of treatment determined by CSOT and by having unauthorized contact in\n\nApril 2008 with K.B., a person identified in the indictment as a family member, casual\n\nrelation, or potential victim. On December 10, 2008, a grand jury indicted Appellant\n\nfor violating the requirements of his civil commitment order by having unauthorized\n\ncontact “without approval of his case manager and treatment provider” in\n\nSeptember, October, and November 2008 with S.M. and M.M., persons identified in\n\nthe indictments as family members or casual relations.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Appellant filed motions to quash the August and December 2008 indictments,\n\nand the trial court denied the motions to quash after conducting a hearing. Appellant\n\nthen pleaded guilty in each case, and the trial court sentenced him to ten years’\n\nconfinement for each offense, with the sentences to run concurrently.                These\n\nappeals followed.\n\n               III. Alleged Ambiguity in August 2008 Indictment\n\n      Appellant argues in his first point that the trial court erred by failing to quash\n\nthe August 2008 indictment in Cause Number 1112197D (Appellate Cause Number\n\n02-09-00167-CR) because it does not allege an offense in clear and intelligible\n\nterms. The State responds that Appellant failed to preserve this issue for appellate\n\nreview because he did not make this argument to the trial court.\n\n      To preserve a complaint for our review, a party must have presented to the\n\ntrial court a timely request, objection, or motion that states the specific grounds for\n\nthe desired ruling if they are not apparent from the context of the request, objection,\n\nor motion. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Mosley v. State, 983 S.W .2d 249, 265 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1998) (op. on reh’g), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1070 (1999). The code of\n\ncriminal procedure specifically provides,\n\n      If the defendant does not object to a defect, error, or irregularity of form\n      or substance in an indictment or information before the date on which\n      the trial on the merits commences, he waives and forfeits the right to\n      object to the defect, error, or irregularity and he may not raise the\n      objection on appeal or in any other postconviction proceeding.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14(b) (Vernon 2005). Further, when the objection\n\nmade in the trial court does not comport with the argument made on appeal, the\n\n                                            4\n\fappellant fails to preserve the argument for our review. See Martinez v. State, 91\n\nS.W .3d 331, 336 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). “Except for complaints involving systemic\n\n(or absolute) requirements, or rights that are waivable only, which are not involved\n\nhere, all other complaints, whether constitutional, statutory, or otherwise, are\n\nforfeited by failure to comply with Rule 33.1(a).” See Mendez v. State, 138 S.W .3d\n\n334, 342 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n      Appellant filed a motion to quash the August 2008 indictment, but he did not\n\nallege in the motion to quash or argue at the hearing that the indictment does not\n\nallege an offense in clear and intelligible terms; he argued only that health and safety\n\ncode section 841.150(a) contains a bar to prosecution and that he had been denied\n\ndue process and equal protection.         Because Appellant’s appellate argument\n\nconcerning the August 2008 indictment does not comport with the objections and\n\narguments he made in the trial court, Appellant has not preserved his first point for\n\nappellate review. See id.; Martinez, 91 S.W .3d at 336; see also Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 1.14(b) (providing that a defendant waives any complaint concerning\n\nan indictment by not objecting at trial). W e overrule Appellant’s first point.\n\n                         IV. December 2008 Indictments\n\n      Appellant contends in his second point that the trial court erred by failing to\n\nquash the December 2008 indictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D\n\n(Appellate Cause Numbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR), which allege\n\nthat Appellant violated the requirements of his civil commitment order by contacting\n\nfamily members or casual relations in September, October, and November 2008\n\n                                           5\n\f“without approval of his case manager and treatment provider.”             Specifically,\n\nAppellant argues that the relevant statutory chapter, health and safety code chapter\n\n841, provides that its provisions are suspended while he is confined and that the\n\nindictments therefore do not state offenses against the law because he was confined\n\nin September, October, and November 2008.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      1. Sufficiency of Indictment\n\n      The sufficiency of an indictment is a question of law that we review de novo.\n\nState v. Moff, 154 S.W .3d 599, 601 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). In the face of a timely-\n\nfiled motion to quash, an indictment must be analyzed to determine whether it states\n\non its face the facts necessary to allege that an offense was committed, to bar a\n\nsubsequent prosecution for the same offense, and to give the accused notice of the\n\nprecise offense with which he is charged. DeVaughn v. State, 749 S.W .2d 62, 67\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1988); see Rotenberry v. State, 245 S.W .3d 583, 586 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort W orth 2007, pet. ref’d). The indictment must state facts which, if proved,\n\nshow a violation of the law; the indictment must be dismissed if such facts would not\n\nconstitute a criminal offense. Posey v. State, 545 S.W .2d 162, 163 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1977); State v. Williams, 780 S.W .2d 891, 894 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1989, no\n\npet.). An indictment that fails to allege an offense is so defective that it cannot vest\n\njurisdiction. Tex. Const. art. V, § 12(b); Studer v. State, 799 S.W .2d 263, 272–73\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1990). However, the State need not allege facts that are merely\n\nevidentiary in nature. Bynum v. State, 767 S.W .2d 769, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).\n\n                                           6\n\fA motion to quash should be granted only when the language regarding the\n\naccused’s conduct is so vague or indefinite that it fails to give the accused adequate\n\nnotice of the acts that he allegedly committed. DeVaughn, 749 S.W .2d at 67.\n\n      2. Health and Safety Code Chapter 841\n\n      Chapter 841 of the health and safety code sets forth the procedures and\n\nrequirements applicable before and after a person is adjudicated a sexually violent\n\npredator. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.001–.150 (Vernon 2010).\n\nOnce a person has been adjudicated a sexually violent predator, the trial court is\n\nrequired to “impose on the person requirements necessary to ensure the person’s\n\ncompliance with treatment and supervision and to protect the community.” Id. §\n\n841.082(a).   That civil commitment order must include, among other things,\n\nrequirements that the person participate in and comply with a specific course of\n\ntreatment and that the person not contact a victim or potential victim.         Id. §\n\n841.082(a)(2), (4). The person commits a third degree felony if he violates a\n\nrequirement of his civil commitment order. Id. § 841.085(a), (b).\n\n      Chapter 841 also imposes duties on the person’s case manager to provide\n\nsupervision to the person, coordinate the person’s outpatient treatment, and provide\n\nsemi-annual reports. Id. § 841.083(b), (e). However, section 841.150(a) provides\n\nthat “[t]he duties imposed by [chapter 841] are suspended for the duration of any\n\nconfinement of a person, or any commitment of a person to a community center,\n\nmental health facility, or state school, by governmental action.” Id. § 841.150(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fB. Analysis\n\n      At the motion to quash hearing, Appellant presented evidence that he was\n\nconfined at the time he allegedly violated his civil commitment order in September,\n\nOctober, and November 2008. Relying on that evidence, Appellant argues that the\n\nDecember 2008 indictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D (Appellate\n\nCause Numbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR) do not allege offenses\n\nagainst the law because health and safety code section 841.150(a) provides that the\n\nduties imposed by Chapter 841 were suspended while he was confined. The State\n\nresponds that the issue is one of notice, that the sufficiency of an indictment is\n\ndetermined by comparing the face of the indictment to the applicable statute, that the\n\nreviewing court cannot consider the factual record in determining the sufficiency of\n\nthe indictment, and that the indictments provided Appellant with sufficient notice of\n\nviolations of his civil commitment order.2 W e agree with the State.\n\n      On their faces, the December 2008 indictments identify Appellant and allege\n\nthat he is a person subject to a civil commitment order, that he intentionally or\n\nknowingly violated the requirements of that civil commitment order, and that he\n\n\n      2\n         The State also argues that Appellant has briefed only count one of the\nDecember 2008 indictments and has therefore forfeited any complaint about the\nremaining counts in each indictment. W e disagree. All counts in the December\n2008 indictments are identical except for the name of the person contacted and the\ndate of the contact; Appellant’s brief refers to all dates in September, October, and\nNovember 2008 on which he allegedly violated his civil commitment order;\nAppellant’s second point is framed as encompassing all counts in each of the\nDecember 2008 indictments; and Appellant’s prayer seeks reversal of the judgments\nin their entirety. Thus, Appellant did not forfeit any complaint concerning the\nDecember 2008 indictments.\n\n                                          8\n\fviolated the civil commitment order on specific dates by contacting identified family\n\nmembers or casual relations without the approval of his case manager. Health and\n\nsafety code section 841.085 provides that a person commits a third degree felony\n\nif he violates a requirement of his civil commitment order. See Tex. Health & Safety\n\nCode Ann. § 841.085(a), (b).\n\n      The December 2008 indictments invoked the trial court’s jurisdiction because\n\nthey charged Appellant with the commission of the crime of violating a civil\n\ncommitment order. See Teal v. State, 230 S.W .3d 172, 182 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007);\n\nsee also Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.085(a), (b). Further, the indictments\n\nprovided Appellant with sufficient notice of the charges against him by adequately\n\nsetting forth facts alleging that Appellant violated his civil commitment order by\n\ncontacting identified persons on identified dates without his case manager’s\n\napproval. See Ahmad v. State, 295 S.W .3d 731, 747 (Tex. App.—Fort W orth 2009,\n\npet. ref’d) (“The Sixth Amendment requires that the defendant be apprised of the\n\n‘nature and cause’ of the accusation against him with such clarity and detail that he\n\ncan adequately prepare a defense.”) (citing Moff, 154 S.W .3d at 601). Indeed,\n\nAppellant clearly had notice of the charges against him; at the motion to quash\n\nhearing, Appellant called witnesses to testify about his confinement, and he argued\n\nthat the trial court should quash the December 2008 indictments because his\n\nconfinement at the time of the alleged offenses meant that he did not violate his civil\n\ncommitment order. That Appellant may or may not have had a factual defense that\n\nhe was confined at the time he contacted the identified family members or casual\n\n\n                                          9\n\frelations is not relevant to our analysis in determining whether the trial court should\n\nhave granted Appellant’s motion to quash because we are confined to the face of the\n\nindictment and the applicable statute and because the State need not allege facts\n\nthat are merely evidentiary in nature.3 See DeVaughn, 769 S.W .2d at 67; Bynum,\n\n767 S.W .2d at 778; Rotenberry, 245 S.W .3d at 586.            The December 2008\n\nindictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D (Appellate Cause\n\nNumbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR) invoked the trial court’s jurisdiction\n\nand provided Appellant with sufficient notice of the charges against him. Therefore,\n\nwe overrule Appellant’s second point.\n\n                                   V. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled each of Appellant’s two points, we affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgments.\n\n                                               PER CURIAM\n\nPANEL: GARDNER and MCCOY, JJ.; and W ILLIAM BRIGHAM (Senior Justice,\nRetired, Sitting by Assignment).\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: November 8, 2010\n\n\n      3\n         W e express no opinion as to whether Appellant actually had a factual\ndefense to the third-degree felony of violating the terms of his civil commitment order\nbecause the standard of review applicable in this case prohibits any consideration\nof the factual record from the motion to quash hearing. See Moff, 154 S.W .3d at\n601–02; Adams v. State, 707 S.W .2d 900, 903–04 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). W e also\nexpress no opinion concerning the effect of health and safety code section\n841.150(a) on the facts of this case. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n§ 841.150(a) (providing that “the duties imposed by this chapter are suspended for\nthe duration of any confinement of a person, or any commitment of a person to a\ncommunity center, mental health facility, or state school, by governmental action”).\n\n                                          10\n\f",

In two points,\n\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to quash the August 2008\n\nindictment in Cause Number 1112197D (Appellate Cause Number 02-09-00167-CR)\n\nbecause it does not allege an offense in clear and intelligible terms and by failing to\n\nquash the December 2008 indictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D\n\n(Appellate Cause Numbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR) because they\n\ndo not allege offenses against the law. W e affirm.\n\n                                  II. Background\n\n      A jury convicted Appellant in 1982 of murder and assessed his punishment at\n\ntwenty-five years in prison.     See In re Miller, 262 S.W .3d 877, 881 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 2008, pet. denied), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009). Near the\n\nend of Appellant’s twenty-five-year prison term, the State filed a petition for civil\n\ncommitment under the Texas Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act). Id. at 881; see\n\nTex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.002(7-a), (8)(D) (Vernon 2010). Following\n\na jury trial, the jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant is\n\na sexually violent predator as defined by health and safety code section 841.003.\n\nSee Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.003 (Vernon 2010). The resulting\n\njudgment and civil commitment order required, among other things, that Appellant\n\n\n\n\n      1\n           See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.085 (Vernon 2010).\n\n                                          2\n\f“not contact, or cause to be contacted, in person, by telephone, correspondence, or\n\nby any electronic means, a victim or potential victim of [Appellant], including the\n\ncomplaining witnesses in all cases [in which Appellant] has been charged, convicted,\n\n[or] otherwise committed” and that he “participate in and comply with a specific\n\ncourse of treatment, determined by the Council on Sex Offender Treatment [CSOT].”\n\n      Appellant discharged his underlying twenty-five-year sentence on February 23,\n\n2008, and CSOT assumed sole responsibility for his supervision. Several months\n\nlater, Appellant’s therapist determined that Appellant had violated a condition of his\n\ncivil commitment order and terminated Appellant from the sex offender treatment\n\nprogram. Appellant was then arrested for violating the requirements of his civil\n\ncommitment order, transferred to the Tarrant County jail, classified as a maximum\n\nsecurity inmate, and placed in administrative segregation.\n\n      On August 1, 2008, a grand jury indicted Appellant for violating the\n\nrequirements of his civil commitment order in May 2008 by failing to comply with the\n\ncourse of treatment determined by CSOT and by having unauthorized contact in\n\nApril 2008 with K.B., a person identified in the indictment as a family member, casual\n\nrelation, or potential victim. On December 10, 2008, a grand jury indicted Appellant\n\nfor violating the requirements of his civil commitment order by having unauthorized\n\ncontact “without approval of his case manager and treatment provider” in\n\nSeptember, October, and November 2008 with S.M. and M.M., persons identified in\n\nthe indictments as family members or casual relations.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Appellant filed motions to quash the August and December 2008 indictments,\n\nand the trial court denied the motions to quash after conducting a hearing. Appellant\n\nthen pleaded guilty in each case, and the trial court sentenced him to ten years’\n\nconfinement for each offense, with the sentences to run concurrently.                These\n\nappeals followed.\n\n               III. Alleged Ambiguity in August 2008 Indictment\n\n      Appellant argues in his first point that the trial court erred by failing to quash\n\nthe August 2008 indictment in Cause Number 1112197D (Appellate Cause Number\n\n02-09-00167-CR) because it does not allege an offense in clear and intelligible\n\nterms. The State responds that Appellant failed to preserve this issue for appellate\n\nreview because he did not make this argument to the trial court.\n\n      To preserve a complaint for our review, a party must have presented to the\n\ntrial court a timely request, objection, or motion that states the specific grounds for\n\nthe desired ruling if they are not apparent from the context of the request, objection,\n\nor motion. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Mosley v. State, 983 S.W .2d 249, 265 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1998) (op. on reh’g), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999). The code of\n\ncriminal procedure specifically provides,\n\n      If the defendant does not object to a defect, error, or irregularity of form\n      or substance in an indictment or information before the date on which\n      the trial on the merits commences, he waives and forfeits the right to\n      object to the defect, error, or irregularity and he may not raise the\n      objection on appeal or in any other postconviction proceeding.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14(b) (Vernon 2005). Further, when the objection\n\nmade in the trial court does not comport with the argument made on appeal, the\n\n                                            4\n\fappellant fails to preserve the argument for our review. See Martinez v. State, 91\n\nS.W .3d 331, 336 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). “Except for complaints involving systemic\n\n(or absolute) requirements, or rights that are waivable only, which are not involved\n\nhere, all other complaints, whether constitutional, statutory, or otherwise, are\n\nforfeited by failure to comply with Rule 33.1(a).” See Mendez v. State, 138 S.W .3d\n\n334, 342 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n      Appellant filed a motion to quash the August 2008 indictment, but he did not\n\nallege in the motion to quash or argue at the hearing that the indictment does not\n\nallege an offense in clear and intelligible terms; he argued only that health and safety\n\ncode section 841.150(a) contains a bar to prosecution and that he had been denied\n\ndue process and equal protection.         Because Appellant’s appellate argument\n\nconcerning the August 2008 indictment does not comport with the objections and\n\narguments he made in the trial court, Appellant has not preserved his first point for\n\nappellate review. See id.; Martinez, 91 S.W .3d at 336; see also Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 1.14(b) (providing that a defendant waives any complaint concerning\n\nan indictment by not objecting at trial). W e overrule Appellant’s first point.\n\n                         IV. December 2008 Indictments\n\n      Appellant contends in his second point that the trial court erred by failing to\n\nquash the December 2008 indictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D\n\n(Appellate Cause Numbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR), which allege\n\nthat Appellant violated the requirements of his civil commitment order by contacting\n\nfamily members or casual relations in September, October, and November 2008\n\n                                           5\n\f“without approval of his case manager and treatment provider.”             Specifically,\n\nAppellant argues that the relevant statutory chapter, health and safety code chapter\n\n841, provides that its provisions are suspended while he is confined and that the\n\nindictments therefore do not state offenses against the law because he was confined\n\nin September, October, and November 2008.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      1. Sufficiency of Indictment\n\n      The sufficiency of an indictment is a question of law that we review de novo.\n\nState v. Moff, 154 S.W .3d 599, 601 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). In the face of a timely-\n\nfiled motion to quash, an indictment must be analyzed to determine whether it states\n\non its face the facts necessary to allege that an offense was committed, to bar a\n\nsubsequent prosecution for the same offense, and to give the accused notice of the\n\nprecise offense with which he is charged. DeVaughn v. State, 749 S.W .2d 62, 67\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1988); see Rotenberry v. State, 245 S.W .3d 583, 586 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort W orth 2007, pet. ref’d). The indictment must state facts which, if proved,\n\nshow a violation of the law; the indictment must be dismissed if such facts would not\n\nconstitute a criminal offense. Posey v. State, 545 S.W .2d 162, 163 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1977); State v. Williams, 780 S.W .2d 891, 894 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1989, no\n\npet.). An indictment that fails to allege an offense is so defective that it cannot vest\n\njurisdiction. Tex. Const. art. V, § 12(b); Studer v. State, 799 S.W .2d 263, 272–73\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1990). However, the State need not allege facts that are merely\n\nevidentiary in nature. Bynum v. State, 767 S.W .2d 769, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).\n\n                                           6\n\fA motion to quash should be granted only when the language regarding the\n\naccused’s conduct is so vague or indefinite that it fails to give the accused adequate\n\nnotice of the acts that he allegedly committed. DeVaughn, 749 S.W .2d at 67.\n\n      2. Health and Safety Code Chapter 841\n\n      Chapter 841 of the health and safety code sets forth the procedures and\n\nrequirements applicable before and after a person is adjudicated a sexually violent\n\npredator. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.001–.150 (Vernon 2010).\n\nOnce a person has been adjudicated a sexually violent predator, the trial court is\n\nrequired to “impose on the person requirements necessary to ensure the person’s\n\ncompliance with treatment and supervision and to protect the community.” Id. §\n\n841.082(a).   That civil commitment order must include, among other things,\n\nrequirements that the person participate in and comply with a specific course of\n\ntreatment and that the person not contact a victim or potential victim.         Id. §\n\n841.082(a)(2), (4). The person commits a third degree felony if he violates a\n\nrequirement of his civil commitment order. Id. § 841.085(a), (b).\n\n      Chapter 841 also imposes duties on the person’s case manager to provide\n\nsupervision to the person, coordinate the person’s outpatient treatment, and provide\n\nsemi-annual reports. Id. § 841.083(b), (e). However, section 841.150(a) provides\n\nthat “[t]he duties imposed by [chapter 841] are suspended for the duration of any\n\nconfinement of a person, or any commitment of a person to a community center,\n\nmental health facility, or state school, by governmental action.” Id. § 841.150(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fB. Analysis\n\n      At the motion to quash hearing, Appellant presented evidence that he was\n\nconfined at the time he allegedly violated his civil commitment order in September,\n\nOctober, and November 2008. Relying on that evidence, Appellant argues that the\n\nDecember 2008 indictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D (Appellate\n\nCause Numbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR) do not allege offenses\n\nagainst the law because health and safety code section 841.150(a) provides that the\n\nduties imposed by Chapter 841 were suspended while he was confined. The State\n\nresponds that the issue is one of notice, that the sufficiency of an indictment is\n\ndetermined by comparing the face of the indictment to the applicable statute, that the\n\nreviewing court cannot consider the factual record in determining the sufficiency of\n\nthe indictment, and that the indictments provided Appellant with sufficient notice of\n\nviolations of his civil commitment order.2 W e agree with the State.\n\n      On their faces, the December 2008 indictments identify Appellant and allege\n\nthat he is a person subject to a civil commitment order, that he intentionally or\n\nknowingly violated the requirements of that civil commitment order, and that he\n\n\n      2\n         The State also argues that Appellant has briefed only count one of the\nDecember 2008 indictments and has therefore forfeited any complaint about the\nremaining counts in each indictment. W e disagree. All counts in the December\n2008 indictments are identical except for the name of the person contacted and the\ndate of the contact; Appellant’s brief refers to all dates in September, October, and\nNovember 2008 on which he allegedly violated his civil commitment order;\nAppellant’s second point is framed as encompassing all counts in each of the\nDecember 2008 indictments; and Appellant’s prayer seeks reversal of the judgments\nin their entirety. Thus, Appellant did not forfeit any complaint concerning the\nDecember 2008 indictments.\n\n                                          8\n\fviolated the civil commitment order on specific dates by contacting identified family\n\nmembers or casual relations without the approval of his case manager. Health and\n\nsafety code section 841.085 provides that a person commits a third degree felony\n\nif he violates a requirement of his civil commitment order. See Tex. Health & Safety\n\nCode Ann. § 841.085(a), (b).\n\n      The December 2008 indictments invoked the trial court’s jurisdiction because\n\nthey charged Appellant with the commission of the crime of violating a civil\n\ncommitment order. See Teal v. State, 230 S.W .3d 172, 182 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007);\n\nsee also Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 841.085(a), (b). Further, the indictments\n\nprovided Appellant with sufficient notice of the charges against him by adequately\n\nsetting forth facts alleging that Appellant violated his civil commitment order by\n\ncontacting identified persons on identified dates without his case manager’s\n\napproval. See Ahmad v. State, 295 S.W .3d 731, 747 (Tex. App.—Fort W orth 2009,\n\npet. ref’d) (“The Sixth Amendment requires that the defendant be apprised of the\n\n‘nature and cause’ of the accusation against him with such clarity and detail that he\n\ncan adequately prepare a defense.”) (citing Moff, 154 S.W .3d at 601). Indeed,\n\nAppellant clearly had notice of the charges against him; at the motion to quash\n\nhearing, Appellant called witnesses to testify about his confinement, and he argued\n\nthat the trial court should quash the December 2008 indictments because his\n\nconfinement at the time of the alleged offenses meant that he did not violate his civil\n\ncommitment order. That Appellant may or may not have had a factual defense that\n\nhe was confined at the time he contacted the identified family members or casual\n\n\n                                          9\n\frelations is not relevant to our analysis in determining whether the trial court should\n\nhave granted Appellant’s motion to quash because we are confined to the face of the\n\nindictment and the applicable statute and because the State need not allege facts\n\nthat are merely evidentiary in nature.3 See DeVaughn, 769 S.W .2d at 67; Bynum,\n\n767 S.W .2d at 778; Rotenberry, 245 S.W .3d at 586.            The December 2008\n\nindictments in Cause Numbers 1139006D and 1139010D (Appellate Cause\n\nNumbers 02-09-00168-CR and 02-09-00169-CR) invoked the trial court’s jurisdiction\n\nand provided Appellant with sufficient notice of the charges against him. Therefore,\n\nwe overrule Appellant’s second point.\n\n                                   V. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled each of Appellant’s two points, we affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgments.\n\n                                               PER CURIAM\n\nPANEL: GARDNER and MCCOY, JJ.; and W ILLIAM BRIGHAM (Senior Justice,\nRetired, Sitting by Assignment).\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: November 8, 2010\n\n\n      3\n         W e express no opinion as to whether Appellant actually had a factual\ndefense to the third-degree felony of violating the terms of his civil commitment order\nbecause the standard of review applicable in this case prohibits any consideration\nof the factual record from the motion to quash hearing. See Moff, 154 S.W .3d at\n601–02; Adams v. State, 707 S.W .2d 900, 903–04 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). W e also\nexpress no opinion concerning the effect of health and safety code section\n841.150(a) on the facts of this case. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n§ 841.150(a) (providing that “the duties imposed by this chapter are suspended for\nthe duration of any confinement of a person, or any commitment of a person to a\ncommunity center, mental health facility, or state school, by governmental action”).\n\n                                          10\n\f</pre>",
