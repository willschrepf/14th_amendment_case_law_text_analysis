JONES, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n\n     *\n       District Judge of the Northern District of Texas, sitting\nby designation.\n\n                                 1\n\f           This case pits a community’s effort to send 22 children\n\nto the school that will best serve their educational needs1 against\n\nthe district court’s interpretation of a 27-year-old statewide\n\nschool desegregation decree.       At issue is whether the injunctive\n\ndecree prohibits a neighborhood subdivision from changing school\n\ndistricts,   even   though   the   move   would   only   alter   the   racial\n\ncomposition of the district from which the subdivision is detached\n\nby approximately 2.7 percent.\n\n           Because we conclude that the proposed boundary change\n\ndoes not violate the United States Constitution or the district\n\ncourt’s desegregation order, properly construed, we REVERSE.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Since 1971, the Texas public education system has been\n\ngoverned according to a federal court order2 designed to ensure\n\nthat “no child will be effectively denied equal opportunity to\n\neducational opportunities on account of race, color or national\n\norigin.”   The modified order provides, inter alia, that the state\n\nof Texas, the Texas Education Agency (“TEA”), its officers, agents,\n\nand employees\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Texas’s annexation and detachment statute exists to allow\nresidents of a territory some choice in determining their school\ndistrict affiliation. See, e.g., Comal Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\nBexar County, No. 066-R6-283 (Comm’r Educ. Jan. 1984).\n     2\n       Hereinafter, the 1971 federal court order will be referred\nto as “modified order 5281” or simply “modified order.”\n\n                                     2\n\f       shall not permit, make arrangements for, approve,\n       acquiesce in, or give support of any kind to changes in\n       school district boundary lines -- whether by detachment,\n       annexation, or consolidation of districts in whole or in\n       part -- which are designed to, or do in fact, create,\n       maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual system\n       based on race, color, or national origin.\n\nAccording to the modified order, the board of trustees of any\n\nschool district desiring to annex or consolidate with a nearby\n\ndistrict     must     notify      the     Texas    Commissioner       of     Education\n\n(“Commissioner”) of its intentions.                The Commissioner is required\n\nto    investigate        “the   effects    of     such   a   projected     change    of\n\nboundaries on the desegregation status of all the school districts\n\nconcerned.”        The Commissioner must then report the results of his\n\ninvestigation       to    the   appropriate       county     and   local   officials,\n\nstating whether the proposed change is in violation of law.\n\n             In January 1991, the Forest Springs subdivision, which\n\nlies on the boundary of the Goodrich and Livingston Independent\n\nSchool districts, sought detachment from Goodrich and annexation to\n\nLivingston.        If approved at that time, the detachment would have\n\nremoved approximately 380 acres and twenty-two students (twenty of\n\nwhom are white) from Goodrich.              After notice and public hearing,\n\nthe    Livingston     I.S.D.     school     board    unanimously      approved      the\n\nproposed annexation. Goodrich, however, disapproved the detachment\n\nrequest,     and    the    Forest   Springs       subdivision      appealed    to   the\n\nCommissioner.\n\n             Following a hearing on the merits, the Commissioner found\n\nthat   the   proposed       detachment     and     annexation      neither    violated\n\n                                           3\n\fmodified    order   5281   nor   would   impose   significant   adverse\n\neducational, economic, or social effects on the students in the\n\naffected territories.3     See Forest Springs Subdivision v. Goodrich\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., No. 240-R6-391 (Comm’r Educ. Sept. 1992).        The\n\nCommissioner made pertinent findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw:\n\n       Findings of Fact\n\n       . . . .\n\n       12. [Forest Springs’s] detachment from Goodrich I.S.D.\n       will not result in racial imbalance; however, it does\n       change the majority and minority percentage of [Goodrich\n       I.S.D.’s] school population, based on average daily\n       attendance, by more than one percent.\n\n       . . . .\n\n       14. There is no evidence that the detachment of\n       Petitioner Forest Springs Subdivision from Respondent\n       Goodrich I.S.D. is designed to or does in fact, create,\n       maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school\n       system based on race, color, or national origin.\n\n       15. There is no evidence that the annexation of\n       Petitioner Forest Springs Subdivision from Respondent\n       Livingston I.S.D. is designed to or does in fact, create,\n       maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school\n       system based on race, color, or national origin.\n\n       . . . .\n\n\n       3\n       Under Texas law at that time, the Commissioner was\nrequired to\n\n       consider the educational interests of the students in\n       the affected territory and the affected districts and\n       the social, economic, and educational effects of the\n       proposed boundary change.\n\nTex. Educ. Code Ann. § 19.022(i) (West 1991).\n\n                                   4\n\f      Conclusions of Law\n\n      . . . .\n\n      2. The change of boundaries resulting from detachment of\n      the affected territory from Respondent Goodrich I.S.D.\n      and the annexation of Forest Springs Subdivision,\n      Petitioner, to Livingston I.S.D. does not violate\n      [modified order] 5281.\n\n      3. Detachment of the affected territory from Respondent\n      and annexation of that territory to Livingston I.S.D.\n      will have no significant adverse educational, economic,\n      or social effect on the school districts or students\n      involved.\n\n\nId.   The Commissioner ordered that Forest Springs be annexed to\n\nLivingston.     See id.\n\n            Goodrich sought judicial review of the Commissioner’s\n\ndecision.    A state district court reversed the order and remanded\n\nthe cause to the Commissioner to enter a new order denying the\n\ndetachment    and    annexation.   But   the   Austin   Court   of   Appeals\n\nreversed the district court.       See Texas Educ. Agency v. Goodrich\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 898 S.W.2d 954, 956 (Tex. App.--Austin 1995,\n\nwrit denied).       The appeals court reasoned that due deference must\n\nbe accorded the Commissioner’s judgment.          In Texas, an agency’s\n\ndetermination must be affirmed where it is supported by substantial\n\nevidence.     Applying that test, the appeals court concluded that\n\n“[t]he Commissioner’s finding that the proposed boundary change\n\nwould not create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual\n\nschool system based on race, color or national origin is supported\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\fby   substantial    evidence”    and   rendered    judgment    affirming   the\n\nCommissioner’s decision.        Id. at 959.\n\n           After the Texas Supreme Court denied its application for\n\nwrit of error, Goodrich filed a Motion to Intervene in Civil Action\n\n5281, complaining now to the federal court that the proposed\n\nboundary change violated the court’s modified order and requesting\n\nan injunction.      Livingston I.S.D., its Board of Trustees, and\n\nindividual residents of the Forest Springs subdivision who had\n\nsigned the original petition for detachment and annexation were\n\njoined as Defendants-Intervenors.\n\n           The district court held a hearing on August 22, 1996, in\n\nwhich    evidence     was   introduced        ––   including     the   entire\n\nadministrative record of the proceedings before the TEA –– and\n\ntestimony of lay and expert witnesses was taken.          Participation by\n\nthe State of Texas and the United States, the named parties to the\n\noriginal action, was minimal.              Although Goodrich’s motion for\n\ninjunctive relief was denied, the district court proceeded to issue\n\na declaratory judgment, holding:\n\n           After careful consideration of the evidence\n           presented to this court in this proceeding, it\n           is determined that the proposed detachment\n           [of] Forest Springs subdivision from Goodrich\n           and annexation to Livingston Independent\n           School District would reinforce, renew and\n           encourage a dual school system based on race\n           and color, in violation of this court’s order\n           of July 17, 1971.\n\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\f               The    residents   of   Forest    Springs     filed   this    timely\n\nappeal.4      They argue that the district court erred in (1) finding\n\nthat       under   principles     of   issue    preclusion    the    state    court\n\nproceedings should not bar Goodrich’s subsequent intervention in\n\nfederal      court;    (2)   finding   that     the   proposed   detachment     and\n\nannexation would reinforce, renew or encourage a dual school\n\nsystem; and (3) refusing to apply present standards governing\n\nschool desegregation law, rather than those set out in the modified\n\norder.       Neither the state of Texas nor the TEA has appealed, but\n\nboth the United States and Goodrich have filed briefs as appellees.\n\n                                         II.\n\n               Before we consider Forest Springs’s issues, the Appellees\n\ncontend, we must decide its citizens’ constitutional standing as\n\nintervenors to proceed with this appeal.               See Diamond v. Charles,\n\n476 U.S. 54, 68, 106 S. Ct. 1697, 1706 (1986).               The Residents must\n\nestablish (1) that they have suffered an “injury in fact,” (2)\n\nwhich is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and (3) which\n\nwill be redressed by a favorable decision of this court.                        See\n\nAmerican Forest & Paper Ass’n v. EPA, 137 F.3d 291, 296 (5th Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n               Because the Residents’ claims so easily fulfill “the\n\nirreducible constitutional minimum of standing,” Lujan v. Defenders\n\n\n\n       4\n       Hereinafter, we will refer to the appellant as either the\nresidents of Forest Springs or simply the Residents.\n\n                                          7\n\fof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992), it is\n\na shame that the government resorts to specious arguments to deny\n\nstanding.     Following a favorable ruling from the state appellate\n\ncourts, the Forest Springs subdivision won the right to be detached\n\nfrom Goodrich and become part of Livingston I.S.D.                   For the\n\nResidents of Forest Springs this victory entitled parents to send\n\ntheir children to a public school system many felt had “better\n\neducational    and   extracurricular      opportunities.”        Texas   Educ.\n\nAgency, 898 S.W.2d at 959.          The decision also allowed these\n\ncitizens to support Livingston I.S.D. with their tax dollars and to\n\nparticipate as members of the local community.               When Goodrich\n\nintervened in federal court and secured a favorable declaratory\n\njudgment overturning the annexation, all that was lost.\n\n            The Appellees contend, however, that because neither the\n\nstate nor the TEA has appealed, the Residents alone lack standing.\n\nAppellees cite Diamond in support of their position, but their\n\nreliance is misplaced.        Diamond was a pediatrician engaged in\n\nprivate practice in Illinois.      After the federal court of appeals\n\ndeclared an Illinois abortion law unconstitutional and the State’s\n\nattorney general elected not to defend the law any further, Diamond\n\nappealed to the Supreme Court.           The Court held that Diamond was\n\nunable to satisfy the constitutional requirements of standing\n\nbecause private parties have no judicially cognizable interest in\n\nthe prosecution      or   nonprosecution    of   state   laws.     The   Court\n\n\n                                     8\n\freasoned that a private citizen cannot compel a state to apply its\n\nlaws with a particular degree of vigor, nor must the state enact a\n\nstatute in accord with his wishes.              See Diamond, 476 U.S. at 65,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 1705.       As the Court concluded, “[b]ecause the State\n\nalone is entitled to create a legal code, only the State has the\n\nkind of ‘direct stake’ . . . in defending the standards embodied in\n\nthat code.”      Id. at 65, 106 S. Ct. at 1705.\n\n            Unlike the appellant in Diamond, the residents of Forest\n\nSprings do not pursue this appeal in order to compel the state to\n\nenforce    its    laws,   and     they    are   not     trying    to    defend    the\n\nconstitutionality of a legislative judgment in the absence of a\n\nstate representative.           Instead, the Residents are defending a\n\nprivate right they gained in state court to annex their subdivision\n\nto and send their children to school in Livingston I.S.D.                     These\n\nResidents   are    not    merely   “concerned      bystanders”         invoking   the\n\nexercise    of    judicial      power    “simply      as   a   ‘vehicle    for    the\n\nvindication of value interests,’” id. at 62, 106 S. Ct. at 1703\n\n(quoting United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 687, 92 S. Ct. 2405,\n\n2416 (1973)).      They are concerned parents with a direct stake in\n\nthe quality of education they are able to secure for their children\n\nand, hence, in the outcome of this appeal.\n\n            Moreover, a favorable decision from this court would\n\ndirectly redress the harm alleged in this case. The Commissioner’s\n\norder required that Forest Springs be annexed to Livingston I.S.D.\n\n\n                                          9\n\fAn order of the Commissioner remains in effect until it is modified\n\nor set aside by the courts.            See Temple Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nProctor, 97 S.W.2d 1047, 1052 (Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1936, writ\n\nref’d).    A favorable ruling from this court would remove the last\n\nobstacle preventing Forest Springs’s detachment from Goodrich and\n\nannexation to Livingston.       Although a new date for the annexation\n\nwould be required, state law provides that an appealed decision of\n\nthe Commissioner becomes effective on a date set by the district\n\ncourt in Travis County.      See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 13.005(c) (West\n\n1996). Neither the state of Texas nor the Commissioner is required\n\nto take any action to effectuate the Commissioner’s earlier order.\n\nAs   a   result,   the   redressability      prong    as   well   as   the   other\n\nstandards in the Constitution’s Article III standing requirement is\n\nsatisfied.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            The Residents argue first that the district court erred\n\nin refusing to apply preclusive effect to the final state court\n\njudgment,    which   affirmed   the    Commissioner’s        finding    that   the\n\nproposed detachment and annexation would not violate Modified Order\n\n5281.\n\n            Common-law     doctrines    of    issue    and   claim     preclusion\n\nordinarily shield final judicial determinations of administrative\n\nbodies, whether under the aegis of federal or state government.\n\nSee Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 107-\n\n\n                                       10\n\f08, 111 S. Ct. 2166, 2169 (1991).               Federal courts must give a State\n\nagency’s decision “the same preclusive effect to which it would be\n\nentitled in the State’s courts.”                   University of Tennessee v.\n\nElliott, 478 U.S. 788, 799, 106 S. Ct. 3220, 3226 (1986).\n\n             Under    Texas     law,   a   party     seeking      to    invoke   issue\n\npreclusion must establish: (1) the facts sought to be litigated in\n\nthe second action were fully and fairly litigated in the prior\n\naction; (2) those facts were essential to the judgment in the first\n\naction; and (3) the parties were cast as adversaries in the first\n\naction. See Bonniwell v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 663 S.W.2d 816, 818\n\n(Tex. 1984).         Judgments and decisions of state administrative\n\nagencies are entitled to preclusive effect where the administrative\n\nagency   has    acted    in   adjudicatory,        judicial      or    quasi-judicial\n\ncapacity.      See Railroad Comm’n v. Phillips, 364 S.W.2d 408, 411\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1963, no writ); see also Muckelroy v.\n\nRichardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 884 S.W.2d 825, 830 (Tex. App.--\n\nDallas 1994, writ denied).\n\n             In this case, the first two requirements for issue\n\npreclusion clearly apply.          The parties’ dispute was litigated to\n\nthe   hilt     in    state    administrative        and    judicial      proceedings,\n\nincluding the issue whether the proposed boundary change violated\n\n“[modified     order]    5281    or    result[ed]         in   significant   adverse\n\neducational, economic or social effects, or whether the boundary\n\nchanges [were] in the educational interests of the students.”\n\n\n                                           11\n\fForest Springs Subdivision v. Goodrich Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 240-\n\nR6-391 (Comm’r Educ. Sept. 1992).\n\n             The appellees urge, and the district court erroneously\n\nheld, that issue preclusion is inapplicable because the state\n\ncourts did not rule definitively on whether the proposed boundary\n\nchange   complied   with   modified   order   5281.   Technically,   as\n\nappellees observe, the only issue before the state courts was\n\nwhether the Commissioner’s findings were supported by substantial\n\nevidence.5    But this is all that issue preclusion requires in the\n\nadministrative context. A state court reviewing the decision of an\n\nadministrative agency need not proceed as though it were writing on\n\ntabula rasa.    See Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461,\n\n481 n.21, 102 S. Ct. 1883, 1897 n.21 (1982).\n\n\n\n     5\n       The Texas Court of Appeals framed the issue in this\nmanner:\n\n          Although the parties have defined their dispute in\n     terms of violation of the federal order, this Court\ndoes not sit to interpret and collaterally enforce a federal\norder. Instead, . . . we review for substantial evidence\nquestions committed to the agency’s discretion and challenged by\nthe parties on appeal. By stipulation the parties agreed that\nthe creation, maintenance, reinforcement, renewal, or\nencouragement of a dual school system in violation of the federal\norder was the only educational effect of sufficient gravity to\npreclude Forest Springs’ annexation to Livingston. Therefore,\nthe issue before us is whether the Commissioner’s decision to\nallow the annexation of Forest Springs to Livingston I.S.D. is\nsupported by substantial evidence that such boundary change would\nnot create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual\nschool system based on race, color, or national origin.\n\nTexas Educ. Agency, 898 S.W.2d at 956-57 (citations omitted).\n\n                                  12\n\f           The district court also rejected issue preclusion arising\n\nfrom the state proceedings with a puzzling statement that\n\n     if the parties had sought to relitigate in state court\n     the issues that had been decided by the modified order,\n     this court could have been moved to enjoin the state\n     court proceedings in order to ‘protect or effectuate’ its\n     judgment. 22 U.S.C. § 2283.\n\nThis statement may be correct, but it is quite beside the point.\n\nThe parties never sought to relitigate issues in state court that\n\nhad been decided by the modified order.          On the contrary, the\n\nadministrative proceeding before the Commissioner followed the\n\nexpress   directive   of   the   modified   order,   which   required   the\n\nCommissioner to investigate and issue findings concerning how any\n\nproposed school boundary change affects the schools’ desegregation\n\nstatus and whether it comports with “the law,” presumably including\n\nmodified order 5281.       If there is a procedural anomaly in this\n\napproach, it was created by the modified order and not by the\n\nCommissioner or the parties.\n\n           But while the state administrative proceedings would\n\ngenerate issue preclusion among their participants, Forest Springs\n\nand Goodrich, this cannot occur as to the United States, which was\n\nnot a party to the state proceedings.          Normally, a judgment or\n\ndecree cannot bind strangers to the litigation.              See Martin v.\n\nWilks, 490 U.S. 755, 762, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 2184 (1989).            Although\n\n\n\n\n                                    13\n\fthere are some exceptions to this rule,6 the United States is\n\nrarely “barred from independent litigation by the failure of a\n\nprivate plaintiff.”   United States v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch.\n\nDist., 594 F.2d 56, 58 (5th Cir. 1979); but see Tyus v. Schoemehl,\n\n93 F.3d 449, 456 (8th Cir. 1996).     Barring a showing, not made\n\nhere, that the government maintained a “laboring oar” in the state\n\ncourt litigation, Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155, 99\n\nS. Ct. 970, 974 (1979) (quoting Drummond v. United States, 324 U.S.\n\n316, 318, 65 S. Ct. 659, 660 (1945)), preclusion doctrine is\n\ninapplicable to the United States.7\n\n\n     6\n       Exceptions to this general rule have been found where\nthere is privity between the party to the second suit and a party\nwho is bound by an earlier judgment, see Richards v. Jefferson\nCounty, Ala., 517 U.S. 793, 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 1766 (1996);\nwhere a person, although not a party, has his interests\nadequately represented by someone with the same interest who is a\nparty, as in the case of a “class” or “representative” suit, see\nid. at 798-99, 116 S. Ct. at 1766 (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311\nU.S. 32, 41-42, 61 S. Ct. 115, 117-18 (1940); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23); where a party to the second suit exercised “control” over\nthe litigation of a party who was bound by the earlier action,\nsee Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 154-55, 99 S. Ct.\n970, 974 (1979); or where an express or implied legal\nrelationship exists between a party to the second suit and the\nparty bound by the earlier action--e.g., “‘estate beneficiaries\nbound by administrators, presidents and sole stockholders by\ntheir companies, parent corporations by their subsidiaries, and a\ntrust beneficiary by the trustee’”--so that it could be said that\nthe subsequent litigant was “virtually represented” by the\nearlier one, Pollard v. Cockrell, 578 F.2d 1002, 1008-09 (5th\nCir. 1978) (quoting Southwest Airlines Co. v. Texas Int’l\nAirlines, 546 F.2d 84, 95 (1977)).\n     7\n       The Forest Springs residents argue that the United States\nwas essentially a bystander to the federal proceeding, offering\nno evidence and limiting its participation to “rather cursory”\ncross-examinations of a couple of witnesses. To the extent the\n\n                                14\n\f                                    IV.\n\n          The district court rejected every assertion of the Forest\n\nSprings   residents    supporting     their   proposed   annexation   to\n\nLivingston I.S.D.     The court found as matters of fact that if the\n\nannexation were approved, it (1) would limit Goodrich’s financial\n\nability to run a school district, (2) would create a perception\n\nthat race is a relevant factor in establishing district boundaries,\n\nand (3) would likely trigger further annexations and increased\n\nschool segregation.     The court interpreted its modified order to\n\nincorporate a 1% “guideline” for evaluating the resegregative\n\nimpact of boundary changes on the racial makeup of affected school\n\ndistricts.   Finally, it refused to read the 27-year old modified\n\norder in light of more recent Supreme Court decisions concerning\n\nschool desegregation decrees.       Portentous significance must flow,\n\nin the district court’s view, from the detachment of a few hundred\n\nacres and 22 students from Goodrich.\n\n          Unlike the district court, we believe that much less is\n\ninvolved in this minuscule boundary change.         First, it does not\n\ncontravene even the court’s own modified order, properly construed.\n\nSecond, the district court’s factual findings are either clearly\n\nerroneous or too attenuated to demonstrate that the proposed\n\n\n\ngovernment is present in a federal suit simply to give an\nunsuccessful state court litigant a second bite at the apple,\nissue preclusion may apply. Cf. Montana, 440 U.S. at 154-55, 99\nS. Ct. at 974. Based on the events in this case, however, there\nis no basis for finding such collusion.\n\n                                    15\n\fboundary change    will   result    in   the   creation    of   a   segregated\n\nGoodrich school district.     Third, the 27-year old modified order\n\ncould and should be interpreted with an eye toward significant\n\nintervening Supreme Court precedent. Each of these points requires\n\nelaboration.8\n\n                                    A.\n\n          Modified order 5281 forbids boundary line changes\n\n     which are designed to, or do in fact, create, maintain,\n     reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based\n     on race, color, or national origin.\n\nThe court found that the Forest Springs boundary change would\n\nreinforce, renew and encourage a racially dual system.               Critical\n\nto, though   not   dispositive     of,   the   court’s    analysis    was   its\n\nadaptation of a 1% guideline from a separate portion of the decree\n\ndealing only with student transfers.           The other provision of the\n\norder forbids defendants from approving student transfers\n\n     where the effect of such transfers will change the\n     majority   or   minority   percentage  of   the   school\n     population . . . by more than one percent (1%) in either\n     the home or the receiving district . . . .\n\nAmendments to modified order 5281, August 9, 1973, at 2.             The court\n\nconsidered this percentage “a useful rule of thumb” for evaluating\n\nthe proposed Forest Springs and future boundary changes. According\n\nto the court’s arithmetic, the Goodrich school-age population would\n\n\n     8\n       In the following discussion, the interpretation of\nmodified order 5281 is a matter of law reviewed de novo on\nappeal, and the court’s factual findings are reviewed under the\nclearly erroneous standard.\n\n                                    16\n\fbe   2.7%     less     white       if   the     boundary       change      occurred.9\n\nInferentially,       the   court    found     that   because    a   2.7%   shift   of\n\nchildren is greater than the 1% “rule of thumb,” the boundary\n\nchange presumptively violated modified order 5281.                  This reasoning\n\nis seriously flawed.\n\n             The court offers no basis, legal or factual, for its\n\ndecision to import the 1% transfer standard into the boundary\n\nchange portion of the decree.               The goal of affording notice to\n\nparties affected by the decree is wholly ignored by this ad hoc\n\nrewriting.    It matters not, and the court did not rely on the fact,\n\nthat apparently the Commissioner has also informally followed a 1%\n\nrule on boundary changes.          The decree simply has no such limit, and\n\ncommon sense suggests why, even if a 1% rule was justifiable for\n\nstudent     transfers,     the     decree     distinguished      between     student\n\ntransfers and boundary changes.             Student transfers are much easier\n\n\n\n     9\n       Students were counted without regard to whether they were\npresently attending school in Goodrich I.S.D. In other words,\n“even if students within a school district had transferred for\nthe present to another school, they would still be counted as\nwithin their home district.” United States v. State of Texas,\nNo. 6:71cv5281, at 6 n.1 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 1996). Based on\nthis methodology, the district court concluded that presently the\nstudent population of Goodrich I.S.D. was 57.8% white. See id.\nNext, the district court determined “the percentage of students\nof the particular race in the school district, minus the area\nproposed to be detached and annexed.” Id. Based on these\ncalculations, the district court found that if the proposed\ndetachment and annexation were approved, Goodrich’s white student\npopulation would be 55.1%. See id. Thus, the district court\nconcluded that the proposed annexation and detachment would\nreduce the white student population by 2.7%.\n\n                                         17\n\ffor school     districts    to    implement    and   would    have   afforded    a\n\nconvenient subterfuge for parties bent on undermining desegregation\n\nefforts.   Boundary changes, on the other hand, are permanent, and\n\nthey irrevocably affect district population, tax base, size and\n\nallocation of resources.         Viewing boundary changes solely from the\n\nperspective of a tiny transient percentage change in school racial\n\nmakeup is too rough a measure of their significance.                  See Texas\n\nEduc. Agency, 898 S.W.2d at 957-58.\n\n           That the court characterized its new 1% standard as a\n\nrule of thumb, not a rigid benchmark, does not ameliorate the\n\nproblem,   for   the   decree     effectively    guides      day-to-day   school\n\nadministrative    decisions.        Cautious    school    officials,      not   to\n\nmention unhappy homeowners, will opt not to buy a lawsuit by\n\nproposing boundary changes that challenge this low threshold.                   One\n\nlook at the protracted seven-year battle waged by Goodrich against\n\nthe   Forest   Springs    residents    proves    the   litigation     potential\n\ninherent in a vague and anachronistically construed remedial order.\n\n           The 1% rule of thumb is also a static statistic with\n\nlittle   analytical      power   for   measuring     segregative     population\n\nchanges.   The district court recognized as much by citing its own\n\nearlier order, which stated that the “one percent guideline . . .\n\ncannot stand as a benchmark by which to rigidly approve or deny\n\ntransfers.” See order re Intervention of Mary Hightower, C.A. 5281\n\n(Sept. 8, 1980) (permitting student transfers that would increase\n\n\n                                       18\n\fthe white population of the transferor school by 7%).10                  In the\n\nHightower order, the district court bowed to governing Fifth\n\nCircuit law, which had already come to reject purely quantitative\n\nanalysis in the desegregation context.               See Davis v. Board of\n\nSchool Comm’rs of Mobile County, 393 F.2d 690, 693 (5th Cir. 1968).\n\nThe district court recognized both in Hightower and in this case\n\nthat the proper inquiry is whether the proposed boundary change\n\nwould      undermine   the    effectiveness    of    its    plan    to   remedy\n\nspecifically identified constitutional violations.11 See, e.g., Lee\n\nv. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d 229, 232 (5th Cir. 1978)\n\n(“In measuring the cumulative effect of a student transfer program\n\non   desegregation,     the   Court   must    do    so   from   a   qualitative\n\n      10\n       In this unpublished order, eight black and two white high\nschool students who lived in one district sought to transfer to a\nlarger district. The smaller district had a 70% white\npopulation, and the transfer would change its racial balance,\nincreasing the white population by 7%. Approving the transfer,\nthe district court denied that this change would render the\nsmaller district segregated.\n      11\n       See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S.\n1, 25, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 1280 (1971) (“We see therefore that the\nuse made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting point\nin the process of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible\nrequirement. From that starting point the District Court\nproceeded to frame a decree that was within its discretionary\npowers, as an equitable remedy for the particular circumstances.\nAs we said in Green, a school authority’s remedial plan or a\ndistrict court’s remedial decree is to be judged by its\neffectiveness. Awareness of the racial composition of the whole\nschool system is likely to be a useful starting point in shaping\na remedy to correct past constitutional violations. In sum, the\nvery limited use made of mathematical ratios was within the\nequitable remedial discretion of the District Court.” (emphasis\nadded) (footnote omitted)).\n\n                                      19\n\fviewpoint, without blind deference to an objective mathematical\n\nformula.”); see also United States v. Lowndes County Bd. of Educ.,\n\n878 F.2d 1301, 1307-08 (11th Cir. 1989).\n\n          Finally, the 1% guideline has absurdly little to do with\n\nthe facts of this case.    Goodrich experienced an annual student\n\n“mobility rate” of about 35%, which means that the population\n\nturnover was dramatic.    The population fluctuated significantly\n\nboth up and down, and an apparent decline in the white student\n\npopulation over several years is attributable to a doubling of\n\nHispanic students.   Amid these seismic shocks, a 1% guideline, or\n\neven an actual 2.7% student population change, is barely a tremor.12\n\n          Not only is the 1% rule of thumb too small to be\n\nprobative of anything, it is, standing alone, legally insufficient\n\nto evaluate compliance with the court’s modified order.   Moreover,\n\nthe 1% “guideline” is not and may not be treated as if it were a\n\npart of the boundary change portion of the modified order.      The\n\ncourt erred by relying on this “rule of thumb” for any purpose\n\nconcerning the proposed boundary change.\n\n\n\n     12\n       See also Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d at\n232 (4% change in racial balance of school district caused by\ntransfer proposal not per se segregative); Lee v. Lee County Bd.\nof Educ., 639 F.2d 1243, 1261 (5th Cir. 1981) (policy that\nresulted in black student population rising from 91 to 96%\nbecause of transfers had no significant segregative effect). In\ncontrast, the government’s reliance on Ross v. Houston Indep.\nSch. Dist., 583 F.2d 712 (5th Cir. 1978), is misplaced. The\ncreation of a breakaway school district raises considerations not\npresent in this boundary change case.\n\n                                20\n\f                                          B.\n\n            In addition to the “violation” of the newly-minted 1%\n\nguideline, the district court found that the boundary change would\n\nviolate modified order 5281 because it would “reinforce, renew, and\n\nencourage   a     dual   school     system     based   on    race   and   color,    in\n\nviolation of this court’s order of July 13, 1971.”                    The district\n\ncourt relied on findings that the proposed annexation would impair\n\nGoodrich’s ability to run an integrated school district; would\n\nlikely    trigger        further     annexations       and     increased     school\n\ndesegregation; and would reinforce the perception that school\n\ndistrict boundaries were drawn on account of race.\n\n            The    district       court   first   found      that   the   money    the\n\ndistrict would lose in the wake of Forest Springs’s detachment\n\nwould    adversely       affect     the   quality      of    the    teaching,      the\n\navailability of resources (e.g., computers), and the type of\n\nprograms Goodrich would be able to offer.\n\n            The court’s sub silentio overruling of the Commissioner’s\n\nfinding of no adverse financial impact on Goodrich is troubling.\n\nThe Commissioner specifically evaluated the pertinent state law\n\nissue whether Forest Springs’s detachment would reduce Goodrich’s\n\ntax base by a ratio at least twice as large as the ratio by which\n\nit would reduce student population.                See Texas Educ. Code Ann.\n\n§ 19.022(d) (West 1991).              It would not, and the parties so\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fstipulated, yet the federal court embarked on its own fact-finding\n\nwithout tether to the standard that Texas law provides.\n\n            The district court’s result is also doubtful standing\n\nalone.    According to unchallenged testimony elicited during trial,\n\nstate and local ad valorem taxes each contribute approximately one-\n\nhalf of the school district’s funding.     Using the methodology the\n\ndistrict court followed,13 the detachment of Forest Springs would\n\nresult in a loss of approximately 22 students.           Goodrich spends\n\napproximately $5,300 per student.       Accordingly, the loss of the\n\nForest Springs students could reduce Goodrich’s expenditures by\n\n$116,600.    If one-half of this amount were supplied by the state,\n\nthe remaining $58,300 must have been financed through local ad\n\nvalorem taxes.    However, Forest Springs’s ad valorem contribution\n\nto Goodrich I.S.D.’s coffers was only about $52,000, almost $6,300\n\nless than the district spent to educate Forest Springs’s children.\n\nFrom this evidence, the district court should have concluded that\n\nGoodrich    I.S.D.   would   actually   benefit   from    the   proposed\n\ndetachment.    In other words, when the boundary change is analyzed\n\nwith proper regard for cost savings, not merely revenues lost, the\n\nresources available to Goodrich to spend on individual pupils would\n\n\n     13\n       The district court found that the proper formula for\nevaluating the impact Forest Spring’s departure would have on the\nstudent population of Goodrich requires that “even if students\nwithin a school district had transferred for the present to\nanother school, they would still be counted within their home\nschool district.” United States v. State of Texas, No.\n6:71cv5281, at 6 n.1 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 1996).\n\n                                  22\n\frise following the detachment of Forest Springs. The evidence does\n\nnot support the district court’s finding that the quality of\n\neducation within Goodrich I.S.D., as measured by money spent, would\n\nbe adversely affected merely by the loss of Forest Springs’s\n\nrevenue.14\n\n             Similarly problematic is the district court’s finding\n\nthat    approval   of   the   boundary    change   would   “trigger   further\n\nannexations and increased school segregation.”               Relying on the\n\nopinion of an expert witness, the district court reasoned that the\n\ndeparture of Forest Springs would push the white population one\n\nstep closer to minority status within Goodrich I.S.D. According to\n\na phenomenon known as “tipping,” as whites approach minority status\n\n“white flight” ensues.        Thus, Goodrich’s loss of Forest Springs\n\nwould accelerate the departure of other white families and would\n\n“‘certainly’ make other subdivisions more likely to seek similar\n\n\n\n\n       14\n       Although we recognize that this analysis assumes that the\nloss of 22 students would not increase the amount of money\nGoodrich I.S.D. spends per pupil (e.g., due to irreducible fixed\ncosts), the evidence does not permit assuming otherwise. The\nrecord focuses almost exclusively on the impact the proposed\nboundary change would have on revenues flowing to Goodrich I.S.D.\nOn cross examination Forest Springs pointed out that the economic\nimpact must be examined from both sides of the ledger.\nSpecifically, Forest Springs argued, “[I]t’s a wash . . . .\n[Y]ou lose fifty thousand dollars of revenue, but you get rid of\nfifty thousand dollars of expenses.” Although on redirect\nGoodrich’s counsel attempted to rehabilitate its witness, the\ntestimony does not yield any evidence that the loss of students\nfrom Forest Springs would detrimentally change Goodrich’s\nexpenditure per pupil.\n\n                                     23\n\fdetachments and annexations.”   Neither the law nor the evidence in\n\nthis case supports such a finding.\n\n          Although the district court’s authority over the Texas\n\neducational system under the venerable desegregation decree is\n\nquite broad, the Supreme Court has reminded us that “‘there are\n\nlimits’ beyond which a court may not go in seeking to dismantle a\n\ndual school system.”    Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427\n\nU.S. 424, 434, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 2704 (1976) (quoting Swann, 402 U.S.\n\nat 28, 91 S. Ct. at 1282).        The modified order reaches the\n\nreinforcement, renewal or encouragement of a dual school system,\n\nand it binds public officials to prevent racial segregation.   The\n\nkey to the order’s scope is state action.   Absent any showing that\n\nschool authorities “have in some manner caused unconstitutional\n\nsegregation,” the district court lacks any power to enjoin a change\n\nin school boundaries.

Ct. at 1282.\n\n          It hardly needs to be added that there is no evidence\n\nthat the demographic change forecast to occur in Goodrich I.S.D. in\n\nthe wake of Forest Springs’s detachment is in any way attributable\n\nto “segregative actions chargeable to the [State].”   Spangler, 427\n\nU.S. at 435, 96 S. Ct. at 2704.       Neither the small number of\n\nstudents involved in the instant case, nor the reduction in the\n\nwhite school-age population from 57.8 to 55.1%, taken alone or\n\ntogether, would directly produce a dual school system, and the\n\n\n                                 24\n\fcourt did not so find.       The court did not find that the boundary\n\nchange was itself a vestige of or flowed from a vestige of a dual\n\nsystem.15    The court also did not find that the vestiges of a\n\nformerly dual school system would be maintained by the proposed\n\nboundary change.     The record is uncontroverted that both Goodrich\n\nand Livingston voluntarily desegregated many years ago, and neither\n\ndistrict was ever subject to a specific local desegregation decree.\n\nFinally,    the   boundary   change    will   not   adversely   affect   the\n\ndistrict’s overall financial status.          State action, in short, has\n\nnot violated the modified order, nor does the proposed boundary\n\nchange have a segregative effect.\n\n            Residential mobility is a virtue of a free and dynamic\n\nsociety.    See Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32, 91 S. Ct. at 1283-84.           No\n\ndoubt     residential   choices       turn    on    economic    and   social\n\nconsiderations or even, at times, on private discrimination, but as\n\nlong as they remain attributable to individual decisions, born of\n\nfree choice, they are devoid of constitutional implications.             See\n\nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 495, 112 S. Ct. 1430, 1448 (1992).\n\nAlthough changing residential patterns inevitably affect the racial\n\ncomposition of schools, it is beyond the authority of the federal\n\ncourts to counteract demographic changes in school districts that\n\n\n\n     15\n       Although the intent of Forest Springs and Livingston is\nnot material to compliance with modified order 5281, we note that\nthe court also did not find any intentional action by Forest\nSprings or Livingston to re-create a dual system.\n\n                                      25\n\fare    the    product    of    private     choice       and   not    state-sanctioned\n\ndiscrimination.         See id. at 495, 112 S. Ct. at 1448.              The district\n\ncourt could not predicate a violation of the modified order on the\n\nforecast that individual residential decisions, unrelated to the\n\neffect of past segregation, would change the district’s racial\n\nmakeup in the future.                Again, it must be emphasized that the\n\nmodified order does not reach private conduct but only state action\n\nthat results in a dual system.\n\n              Moreover,       even    if   it    were    relevant,      the   evidence\n\nfurnishes weak support for the finding that the loss of Forest\n\nSprings would necessarily result in an exodus of white students\n\nfrom Goodrich.        Goodrich’s expert, Dr. Richard Murray, testified\n\nthat studies         suggest    that    white    parents      will    “tolerate”      an\n\nintegrated school district as long as the percentage of minorities\n\nin    the    local   population        remains   within       a   “comfort    zone”   of\n\napproximately 20%.         As the minority population rises, so do the\n\nanxieties of white parents.             When the minority population reaches\n\n40 to 50% of the local population, the studies imply that whites\n\ntend to withdraw from school districts in high numbers and seek\n\nrefuge in more homogeneous communities.\n\n              Applying this theory of “tipping” to a rural district\n\nlike Goodrich is difficult for two reasons.                         First, Dr. Murray\n\nadmitted on cross examination that he was unaware of any academic\n\nstudy that has found an occurrence of tipping in rural communities.\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fAlthough he stated that the phenomenon has occurred in rural\n\nMississippi, he admitted that this observation was purely his own,\n\nnot part of a formal analysis, and, hence, not subject to rigorous\n\nacademic scrutiny.16\n\n            Second,   in   urban   settings    where   tipping   has   been\n\nexamined,    studies suggest that it may be limited to areas where\n\nother neighborhoods and school districts are readily accessible.\n\nIn   urban     neighborhoods,       families     can    relocate       short\n\ndistances –– within a large metropolitan area or to a nearby\n\nsuburb –– and select among public and private schools.             A rural\n\narea like that where Goodrich is located affords fewer choices.\n\nPrivate schools are less common, and alternative neighborhoods, job\n\nopportunities and public school districts tend to be farther away.17\n\n\n     16\n       Forest Springs did not object to the admissibility of Dr.\nMurray’s unsupported personal opinion as lacking an adequate\nfoundation. See Fed. R. Evid. 702; Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993);\nMoore v. Ashland Chem., Inc., 151 F.3d 269 (5th Cir. 1998) (en\nbanc). See also Watkins v. Telsmith, Inc., 121 F.3d 984, 991\nn.11 (5th Cir. 1997) (“‘[A] conclusion without any support is not\none based on expert knowledge and entitled to the dignity of\nevidence.’” (quoting Navarro v. Fuji Heavy Indus., 117 F.3d 1027,\n1031 (7th Cir. 1997) (Posner, J.))).\n     17\n       Dr. Michael Say, Forest Springs’s expert, also testified\nthat all of the academic literature on tipping is at least a\ndecade old. Newer studies suggest that its cause is less clear\nthan previously believed. See, e.g., Gary Orfield, Metropolitan\nSchool Desegregation: Impacts on Metropolitan Society, 80 Minn.\nL. Rev. 825, 867 (1996) (“While many issues in this debate are\nstill unsettled, there are some agreed relationships between\nschool desegregation plans and trends in white enrollment.\nMandatory desegregation plans limited to central cities with\nlarge minority enrollments speed up the decline in white\n\n                                    27\n\fThus,     neither   the   theoretical     likelihood        of   tipping    nor   its\n\npracticability in and around Goodrich is strongly supported.18\n\n             Finally, the district court found that if the proposed\n\nannexation     were   granted,     the   “public     perception     of     [Goodrich\n\nI.S.D.] as the Black school district would be strengthened.”                      But\n\nperceptions     alone     cannot   form       the   basis    for   federal     court\n\nintervention into the administration of a public school system.\n\nEven assuming the testimony relied upon by the district court\n\naccurately reflects community sentiment, this evidence reveals\n\nalmost nothing about whether the demographic changes Goodrich\n\nI.S.D. might undergo in the wake of the proposed boundary change\n\nwould be the product of private choices or a state-sponsored racial\n\n\n\n\nenrollment, at least in the beginning. Virtually all central\ncities, however, have experienced a continuing decline in the\npercent of white students for many years, and declines have been\nsharp in many cities whether or not they had a desegregation\nplan. In cities which have dismantled all or part of their plan,\nthe white enrollment decline continues. In other words, the\nbasic forces that are producing white enrollment decline go far\nbeyond the school desegregation plan although the plan can\naccelerate this decline. On the other hand, analysis of the\nlargest school systems in the United States shows that half of\nthose with the greatest stability of enrollments by race between\nthe 1960s and the mid- 1980s had mandatory metropolitan\ndesegregation plans.” (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted)); see\nalso Robert A. Solomon, Building a Segregated City: How We All\nWorked Together, 16 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 265, 316 (1997)\n(“There is some argument that white-flight is based, in part, on\na perceived reduction in security more than on race per se.”).\n     18\n       It should also be noted that any future detachment would\nbe subject to the strictures of modified order 5281. Thus, to\nthe extent any future event represents unconstitutional\nsegregation, legal redress remains available.\n\n                                         28\n\fclassification.   The court’s finding also fails to square with the\n\npersistent high turnover of the Goodrich school population, its\n\nsignificant   fluctuations   in   size,   and   its    growing   Hispanic\n\ncontingent –– all of which facts are relevant to local perceptions,\n\nand all of which are far more significant than a one-time 2.7%\n\npopulation shift.    District courts cannot substitute subjective\n\njudgments of this character for a finding of an actual segregative\n\neffect.\n\n          Because the district court’s findings of segregative\n\neffects are too speculative, or are not supported by the record, or\n\nare rooted in private conduct rather than state action, they are\n\nclearly erroneous and legally insufficient.           The district court\n\nerred in concluding that the proposed boundary change would violate\n\neither federal law or the modified order.\n\n                                  C.\n\n          The district court declined to consider whether its\n\ninterpretation of modified order 5281 is in accord with post-1971\n\nSupreme Court decisions.     It rejected this contention of Forest\n\nSprings based on the absence of any Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion to\n\nmodify the decree.   Several errors are imbedded in this part of the\n\ncourt’s decision.\n\n          First, except for the superimposed 1% rule -- which\n\nconnotes impermissible racial balancing “for its own sake” rather\n\nthan a remedy for past state action, Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494, 112\n\n\n\n                                  29\n\fS.Ct. at 1447 -- the pertinent portion of modified order 5281,\n\nwhich deals with boundary changes, is not facially inconsistent\n\nwith evolving school desegregation jurisprudence.           The gist of\n\npost-1971 cases has been to confirm federal courts’ broad remedial\n\njurisdiction over those facets of school operations which represent\n\nor flow from an earlier de jure discriminatory system, while\n\nacknowledging that federal remedial jurisdiction goes only so far\n\nas the correction of the constitutional infirmity.           See, e.g.,\n\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 97-98, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 2053-54\n\n(1995); Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496-97, 112 S. Ct. at 1448-49;\n\nSpangler, 427 U.S. at 434-37, 96 S. Ct. at 2704-05; Milliken v.\n\nBradley, 433 U.S. 267, 282, 97 S. Ct. 2749, 2758 (1977); Milliken\n\nv. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 750-53, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 3130-31 (1974);\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S. Ct. at 1276.          The modified order,\n\nalthough written broadly, as was necessary at the outset of the\n\ncourt’s enforcement efforts, easily lends itself to the reading\n\nmandated by the Supreme Court.            The order does not expressly\n\nmandate racial balancing in boundary changes.          Cf. Spangler, 427\n\nU.S. at 434, 96 S. Ct. at 2703.       Nor does it expressly detach the\n\nconsideration of boundary changes from prior unconstitutional state\n\naction.   The district court has, in the Hightower ruling, acceded\n\nto   intervening   Fifth   Circuit    caselaw   that   rejected   trivial\n\nstatistical population differences as a stand-alone basis for\n\nfederal intervention.      See Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573\n\n                                     30\n\fF.2d at 232.         Put otherwise, since there is no reason why the order\n\nmust    be    interpreted      to    extend      the   district   court’s    remedial\n\njurisdiction         beyond    limits     articulated     by   the   Supreme   Court,\n\nprudence      and     deference      to    the    High   Court    strongly     counsel\n\nenforcement of the order consistent with rather than in the teeth\n\nof its pronouncements.\n\n              Second, in light of the compatibility of modified order\n\n5281 with later-articulated law, the district court’s insistence on\n\na   Rule     60(b)    motion    as   a    prerequisite     for    re-evaluating   its\n\nmodified order is a red herring.                 The district court thought that\n\nForest Springs must bear the burden of proving that the entire\n\ndecree –– covering the whole state of Texas –– must be vacated or\n\nmodified in order to justify the Residents’ desire to transfer 22\n\nstudents to Livingston I.S.D.                    The court’s error lies in its\n\nperception that the Residents may only claim relief if the order is\n\nmodified; because the modified order is limited to a remedy of the\n\neffects of past state-imposed segregation, the Residents’ burden\n\nconsisted of demonstrating only that the proposed annexation would\n\nnot confound the remedy.\n\n              Third, to the extent the district court believed that it\n\nlacked the discretion to modify its order sua sponte, it erred.\n\nThis court has clearly held that a district court has the authority\n\nto modify or terminate a consent decree19 sua sponte when it becomes\n\n       19\n       There is no difference in this regard between a consent\ndecree and an order, like modified order 5281, entered without\n\n                                            31\n\fmanifest   that   there   has     been    a   change    in   the   facts    or   the\n\nunderlying law that gave rise to the decree.                   See Williams v.\n\nEdwards, 87 F.3d 126, 132 (5th Cir. 1996) (“[T]he district court\n\nhas the discretion to modify a decree when the court is made aware\n\nthat the factual circumstances or the law underlying that decree\n\nhas changed--regardless of the parties’ silence or inertia.”);\n\nAlberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F.3d 1347, 1365-66 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\nMoreover, in the context of this old case and the significant\n\nclarifications of school desegregation law that have occurred in\n\nthe quarter-century since the modified order was issued, the court\n\nshould have been wary of enforcing its order if the court perceived\n\na significant gap between the order and ensuing legal developments.\n\nThis error, of course, is irrelevant, where, as here, no such gap\n\nappears when the modified order is properly interpreted.\n\n                                         V.\n\n           The Residents of Forest Springs have doggedly pursued\n\ntheir detachment from Goodrich for seven years.                The victory they\n\ndeserve is now probably Pyrrhic, as their children have grown and\n\ntheir   subdivision’s     legal    bills      have     mounted.     It     is    most\n\nunfortunate that a noble decree to end school segregation has\n\ndegenerated into a petty war of attrition against 22 students and\n\n\n\n\nthe parties’ consent. See System Fed’n No. 91 v. Wright, 364\nU.S. 642, 81 S.Ct. 368 (1961).\n\n                                         32\n\f360 acres of tax base.   The declaratory judgment of the district\n\ncourt is REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n                               33\n\f",

But the Austin Court of Appeals reversed the district court.  See Texas Educ. Agency v. Goodrich Indep.  Sch. Dist., 898 S.W.2d 954, 956 (Tex.App.-Austin 1995, writ denied).  The appeals court reasoned that due deference must be accorded the Commissioner's judgment.  In Texas, an agency's determination must be affirmed where it is supported by substantial evidence.  Applying that test, the appeals court concluded that \"[t]he Commissioner's finding that the proposed boundary change would not create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color or national origin is supported by substantial evidence\" and rendered judgment affirming the Commissioner's decision.

Livingston I.S.D., its Board of Trustees, and individual residents of the Forest Springs subdivision who had signed the original petition for detachment and annexation were joined as Defendants-Intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on August 22, 1996, in which evidence was introduced--including the entire administrative record of the proceedings before the TEA--and testimony of lay and expert witnesses was taken.  Participation by the State of Texas and the United States, the named parties to the original action, was minimal.  Although Goodrich's motion for injunctive relief was denied, the district court proceeded to issue a declaratory judgment, holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>After careful consideration of the evidence presented to this court in this proceeding, it is determined that the proposed detachment [of] Forest Springs subdivision from Goodrich and annexation to Livingston Independent School District would reinforce, renew and encourage a dual school system based on race and color, in violation of this court's order of July 17, 1971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents of Forest Springs filed this timely appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  They argue that the district court erred in (1) finding that under principles of issue preclusion the state court proceedings should not bar Goodrich's subsequent intervention in federal court;  (2) finding that the proposed detachment and annexation would reinforce, renew or encourage a dual school system;  and (3) refusing to apply present standards governing school desegregation law, rather than those set out in the modified order.  Neither the state of Texas nor the TEA has appealed, but both the United States and Goodrich have filed briefs as appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we consider Forest Springs's issues, the Appellees contend, we must decide its citizens' constitutional standing as intervenors to proceed with this appeal.  See Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68, 106 S.Ct. 1697, 1706, 90 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986).  The Residents must establish (1) that they have suffered an \"injury in fact,\" (2) which is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and (3) which will be redressed by a favorable decision of this court.   See American Forest &amp; Paper Ass'n v. EPA, 137 F.3d 291, 296 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Residents' claims so easily fulfill \"the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), it is a shame that the government resorts to specious arguments to deny standing.  Following a favorable ruling from the state appellate courts, the Forest Springs subdivision won the right to be detached from Goodrich and become part of Livingston I.S.D. For the Residents of Forest Springs this victory entitled parents to send their children to a public school system many felt had \"better educational and extracurricular opportunities.\"   Texas Educ. Agency, 898 S.W.2d at 959.   The decision also allowed these citizens to support Livingston I.S.D. with their tax dollars and to participate as members of the local community.  When Goodrich intervened in federal court and secured a favorable declaratory judgment overturning the annexation, all that was lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appellees contend, however, that because neither the state nor the TEA has appealed, the Residents alone lack standing.  Appellees cite Diamond in support of their position, but their reliance is misplaced.  Diamond was a pediatrician engaged in private practice in Illinois.  After the federal court of appeals declared an Illinois abortion law unconstitutional and the State's attorney general elected not to defend the law any further, Diamond appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Court held that Diamond was unable to satisfy the constitutional requirements of standing because private parties have no judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of state laws.  The Court reasoned that a private citizen cannot compel a state to apply its laws with a particular degree of vigor, nor must the state enact a statute in accord with his wishes.  See Diamond, 476 U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 1705.   As the Court concluded, \"[b]ecause the State alone is entitled to create a legal code, only the State has the kind of 'direct stake' ... in defending the standards embodied in that code.\"  Id. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 1705.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the appellant in Diamond, the residents of Forest Springs do not pursue this appeal in order to compel the state to enforce its laws, and they are not trying to defend the constitutionality of a legislative judgment in the absence of a state representative.  Instead, the Residents are defending a private right they gained in state court to annex their subdivision to and send their children to school in Livingston I.S.D. These Residents are not merely \"concerned bystanders\" invoking the exercise of judicial power \"simply as a 'vehicle for the vindication of value interests,' \" id. at 62, 106 S.Ct. at 1703 (quoting United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 687, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2416, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973)).  They are concerned parents with a direct stake in the quality of education they are able to secure for their children and, hence, in the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a favorable decision from this court would directly redress the harm alleged in this case.  The Commissioner's order required that Forest Springs be annexed to Livingston I.S.D. An order of the Commissioner remains in effect until it is modified or set aside by the courts.  See Temple Indep.  Sch. Dist. v. Proctor, 97 S.W.2d 1047, 1052 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1936, writ ref'd).  A favorable ruling from this court would remove the last obstacle preventing Forest Springs's detachment from Goodrich and annexation to Livingston.  Although a new date for the annexation would be required, state law provides that an appealed decision of the Commissioner becomes effective on a date set by the district court in Travis County.  See Tex.  Educ.Code Ann. &#167; 13.005(c) (West 1996).  Neither the state of Texas nor the Commissioner is required to take any action to effectuate the Commissioner's earlier order.  As a result, the redressability prong as well as the other standards in the Constitution's Article III standing requirement is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Residents argue first that the district court erred in refusing to apply preclusive effect to the final state court judgment, which affirmed the Commissioner's finding that the proposed detachment and annexation would not violate Modified Order 5281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common-law doctrines of issue and claim preclusion ordinarily shield final judicial determinations of administrative bodies, whether under the aegis of federal or state government.  See Astoria Fed.  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 107-08, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 2169, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991).  Federal courts must give a State agency's decision \"the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State's courts.\"  University of Tennessee v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 799, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 3226, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Texas law, a party seeking to invoke issue preclusion must establish:  (1) the facts sought to be litigated in the second action were fully and fairly litigated in the prior action;  (2) those facts were essential to the judgment in the first action;  and (3) the parties were cast as adversaries in the first action.  See Bonniwell v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 663 S.W.2d 816, 818 (Tex.1984).  Judgments and decisions of state administrative agencies are entitled to preclusive effect where the administrative agency has acted in adjudicatory, judicial or quasi-judicial capacity.  See Railroad Comm'n v. Phillips, 364 S.W.2d 408, 411 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1963, no writ);  see also Muckelroy v. Richardson Indep.  Sch. Dist., 884 S.W.2d 825, 830 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1994, writ denied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the first two requirements for issue preclusion clearly apply.  The parties' dispute was litigated to the hilt in state administrative and judicial proceedings, including the issue whether the proposed boundary change violated \"[modified order] 5281 or result[ed] in significant adverse educational, economic or social effects, or whether the boundary changes [were] in the educational interests of the students.\"  Forest Springs Subdivision v. Goodrich Indep.  Sch. Dist., No. 240-R6-391 (Comm'r Educ. Sept. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees urge, and the district court erroneously held, that issue preclusion is inapplicable because the state courts did not rule definitively on whether the proposed boundary change complied with modified order 5281.  Technically, as appellees observe, the only issue before the state courts was whether the Commissioner's findings were supported by substantial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  But this is all that issue preclusion requires in the administrative context.  A state court reviewing the decision of an administrative agency need not proceed as though it were writing on tabula rasa.  See Kremer v. Chemical Constr.  Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1897 n. 21, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected issue preclusion arising from the state proceedings with a puzzling statement that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>if the parties had sought to relitigate in state court the issues that had been decided by the modified order, this court could have been moved to enjoin the state court proceedings in order to \"protect or effectuate\" its judgment.  22 U.S.C. &#167; 2283.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement may be correct, but it is quite beside the point.  The parties never sought to relitigate issues in state court that had been decided by the modified order.  On the contrary, the administrative proceeding before the Commissioner followed the express directive of the modified order, which required the Commissioner to investigate and issue findings concerning how any proposed school boundary change affects the schools' desegregation status and whether it comports with \"the law,\" presumably including modified order 5281.  If there is a procedural anomaly in this approach, it was created by the modified order and not by the Commissioner or the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while the state administrative proceedings would generate issue preclusion among their participants, Forest Springs and Goodrich, this cannot occur as to the United States, which was not a party to the state proceedings.  Normally, a judgment or decree cannot bind strangers to the litigation.  See Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 762, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 2184, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989).  Although there are some exceptions to this rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the United States is rarely \"barred from independent litigation by the failure of a private plaintiff.\"  United States v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 594 F.2d 56, 58 (5th Cir.1979);  but see Tyus v. Schoemehl, 93 F.3d 449, 456 (8th Cir.1996).  Barring a showing, not made here, that the government maintained a \"laboring oar\" in the state court litigation, Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155, 99 S.Ct. 970, 974, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979) (quoting Drummond v. United States, 324 U.S. 316, 318, 65 S.Ct. 659, 660, 89 L.Ed. 969 (1945)), preclusion doctrine is inapplicable to the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected every assertion of the Forest Springs residents supporting their proposed annexation to Livingston I.S.D. The court found as matters of fact that if the annexation were approved, it (1) would limit Goodrich's financial ability to run a school district, (2) would create a perception that race is a relevant factor in establishing district boundaries, and (3) would likely trigger further annexations and increased school segregation.  The court interpreted its modified order to incorporate a 1% \"guideline\" for evaluating the resegregative impact of boundary changes on the racial makeup of affected school districts.  Finally, it refused to read the 27-year-old modified order in light of more recent Supreme Court decisions concerning school desegregation decrees.  Portentous significance must flow, in the district court's view, from the detachment of a few hundred acres and 22 students from Goodrich.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the district court, we believe that much less is involved in this minuscule boundary change.  First, it does not contravene even the court's own modified order, properly construed.  Second, the district court's factual findings are either clearly erroneous or too attenuated to demonstrate that the proposed boundary change will result in the creation of a segregated Goodrich school district.  Third, the 27-year-old modified order could and should be interpreted with an eye toward significant intervening Supreme Court precedent.  Each of these points requires elaboration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Modified order 5281 forbids boundary line changes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>which are designed to, or do in fact, create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color, or national origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that the Forest Springs boundary change would reinforce, renew and encourage a racially dual system.  Critical to, though not dispositive of, the court's analysis was its adaptation of a 1% guideline from a separate portion of the decree dealing only with student transfers.  The other provision of the order forbids defendants from approving student transfers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>where the effect of such transfers will change the majority or minority percentage of the school population ... by more than one percent (1%) in either the home or the receiving district....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amendments to modified order 5281, August 9, 1973, at 2. The court considered this percentage \"a useful rule of thumb\" for evaluating the proposed Forest Springs and future boundary changes.  According to the court's arithmetic, the Goodrich school-age population would be 2.7% less white if the boundary change occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Inferentially, the court found that because a 2.7% shift of children is greater than the 1% \"rule of thumb,\" the boundary change presumptively violated modified order 5281.  This reasoning is seriously flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court offers no basis, legal or factual, for its decision to import the 1% transfer standard into the boundary change portion of the decree.  The goal of affording notice to parties affected by the decree is wholly ignored by this ad hoc rewriting.  It matters not, and the court did not rely on the fact, that apparently the Commissioner has also informally followed a 1% rule on boundary changes.  The decree simply has no such limit, and common sense suggests why, even if a 1% rule was justifiable for student transfers, the decree distinguished between student transfers and boundary changes.  Student transfers are much easier for school districts to implement and would have afforded a convenient subterfuge for parties bent on undermining desegregation efforts.  Boundary changes, on the other hand, are permanent, and they irrevocably affect district population, tax base, size and allocation of resources.  Viewing boundary changes solely from the perspective of a tiny transient percentage change in school racial makeup is too rough a measure of their significance.  See Texas Educ. Agency, 898 S.W.2d at 957-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the court characterized its new 1% standard as a rule of thumb, not a rigid benchmark, does not ameliorate the problem, for the decree effectively guides day-to-day school administrative decisions.  Cautious school officials, not to mention unhappy homeowners, will opt not to buy a lawsuit by proposing boundary changes that challenge this low threshold.  One look at the protracted seven-year battle waged by Goodrich against the Forest Springs residents proves the litigation potential inherent in a vague and anachronistically construed remedial order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1% rule of thumb is also a static statistic with little analytical power for measuring segregative population changes.  The district court recognized as much by citing its own earlier order, which stated that the \"one percent guideline ... cannot stand as a benchmark by which to rigidly approve or deny transfers.\"   See order re Intervention of Mary Hightower, C.A. 5281 (Sept. 8, 1980) (permitting student transfers that would increase the white population of the transferor school by 7%).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  In the Hightower order, the district court bowed to governing Fifth Circuit law, which had already come to reject purely quantitative analysis in the desegregation context.  See Davis v. Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile County, 393 F.2d 690, 693 (5th Cir.1968).  The district court recognized both in Hightower and in this case that the proper inquiry is whether the proposed boundary change would undermine the effectiveness of its plan to remedy specifically identified constitutional violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See, e.g., Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d 229, 232 (5th Cir.1978) (\"In measuring the cumulative effect of a student transfer program on desegregation, the Court must do so from a qualitative viewpoint, without blind deference to an objective mathematical formula.\");   see also United States v. Lowndes County Bd. of Educ., 878 F.2d 1301, 1307-08 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the 1% guideline has absurdly little to do with the facts of this case.  Goodrich experienced an annual student \"mobility rate\" of about 35%, which means that the population turnover was dramatic.  The population fluctuated significantly both up and down, and an apparent decline in the white student population over several years is attributable to a doubling of Hispanic students.  Amid these seismic shocks, a 1% guideline, or even an actual 2.7% student population change, is barely a tremor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only is the 1% rule of thumb too small to be probative of anything, it is, standing alone, legally insufficient to evaluate compliance with the court's modified order.  Moreover, the 1% \"guideline\" is not and may not be treated as if it were a part of the boundary change portion of the modified order.  The court erred by relying on this \"rule of thumb\" for any purpose concerning the proposed boundary change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the \"violation\" of the newly-minted 1% guideline, the district court found that the boundary change would violate modified order 5281 because it would \"reinforce, renew, and encourage a dual school system based on race and color, in violation of this court's order of July 13, 1971.\"   The district court relied on findings that the proposed annexation would impair Goodrich's ability to run an integrated school district;  would likely trigger further annexations and increased school desegregation;  and would reinforce the perception that school district boundaries were drawn on account of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first found that the money the district would lose in the wake of Forest Springs's detachment would adversely affect the quality of the teaching, the availability of resources (e.g., computers), and the type of programs Goodrich would be able to offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's sub silentio overruling of the Commissioner's finding of no adverse financial impact on Goodrich is troubling.  The Commissioner specifically evaluated the pertinent state law issue whether Forest Springs's detachment would reduce Goodrich's tax base by a ratio at least twice as large as the ratio by which it would reduce student population.  See Texas Educ.Code Ann. &#167; 19.022(d) (West 1991).  It would not, and the parties so stipulated, yet the federal court embarked on its own fact-finding without tether to the standard that Texas law provides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's result is also doubtful standing alone.  According to unchallenged testimony elicited during trial, state and local ad valorem taxes each contribute approximately one-half of the school district's funding.  Using the methodology the district court followed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> the detachment of Forest Springs would result in a loss of approximately 22 students.  Goodrich spends approximately $5,300 per student.  Accordingly, the loss of the Forest Springs students could reduce Goodrich's expenditures by $116,600.  If one-half of this amount were supplied by the state, the remaining $58,300 must have been financed through local ad valorem taxes.  However, Forest Springs's ad valorem contribution to Goodrich I.S.D.'s coffers was only about $52,000, almost $6,300 less than the district spent to educate Forest Springs's children.  From this evidence, the district court should have concluded that Goodrich I.S.D. would actually benefit from the proposed detachment.  In other words, when the boundary change is analyzed with proper regard for cost savings, not merely revenues lost, the resources available to Goodrich to spend on individual pupils would rise following the detachment of Forest Springs.  The evidence does not support the district court's finding that the quality of education within Goodrich I.S.D., as measured by money spent, would be adversely affected merely by the loss of Forest Springs's revenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly problematic is the district court's finding that approval of the boundary change would \"trigger further annexations and increased school segregation.\"   Relying on the opinion of an expert witness, the district court reasoned that the departure of Forest Springs would push the white population one step closer to minority status within Goodrich I.S.D. According to a phenomenon known as \"tipping,\" as whites approach minority status \"white flight\" ensues.  Thus, Goodrich's loss of Forest Springs would accelerate the departure of other white families and would \" 'certainly' make other subdivisions more likely to seek similar detachments and annexations.\"   Neither the law nor the evidence in this case supports such a finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court's authority over the Texas educational system under the venerable desegregation decree is quite broad, the Supreme Court has reminded us that \" 'there are limits' beyond which a court may not go in seeking to dismantle a dual school system.\"  Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 434, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2704, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976) (quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282).   The modified order reaches the reinforcement, renewal or encouragement of a dual school system, and it binds public officials to prevent racial segregation.  The key to the order's scope is state action.  Absent any showing that school authorities \"have in some manner caused unconstitutional segregation,\" the district court lacks any power to enjoin a change in school boundaries.  Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434, 96 S.Ct. at 2704;  see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It hardly needs to be added that there is no evidence that the demographic change forecast to occur in Goodrich I.S.D. in the wake of Forest Springs's detachment is in any way attributable to \"segregative actions chargeable to the [State].\"  Spangler, 427 U.S. at 435, 96 S.Ct. at 2704.   Neither the small number of students involved in the instant case, nor the reduction in the white school-age population from 57.8 to 55.1%, taken alone or together, would directly produce a dual school system, and the court did not so find.  The court did not find that the boundary change was itself a vestige of or flowed from a vestige of a dual system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The court also did not find that the vestiges of a formerly dual school system would be maintained by the proposed boundary change.  The record is uncontroverted that both Goodrich and Livingston voluntarily desegregated many years ago, and neither district was ever subject to a specific local desegregation decree.  Finally, the boundary change will not adversely affect the district's overall financial status.  State action, in short, has not violated the modified order, nor does the proposed boundary change have a segregative effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Residential mobility is a virtue of a free and dynamic society.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32, 91 S.Ct. at 1283-84.   No doubt residential choices turn on economic and social considerations or even, at times, on private discrimination, but as long as they remain attributable to individual decisions, born of free choice, they are devoid of constitutional implications.  See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 495, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1448, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).  Although changing residential patterns inevitably affect the racial composition of schools, it is beyond the authority of the federal courts to counteract demographic changes in school districts that are the product of private choice and not state-sanctioned discrimination.  See id. at 495, 112 S.Ct. at 1448.   The district court could not predicate a violation of the modified order on the forecast that individual residential decisions, unrelated to the effect of past segregation, would change the district's racial makeup in the future.  Again, it must be emphasized that the modified order does not reach private conduct but only state action that results in a dual system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if it were relevant, the evidence furnishes weak support for the finding that the loss of Forest Springs would necessarily result in an exodus of white students from Goodrich.  Goodrich's expert, Dr. Richard Murray, testified that studies suggest that white parents will \"tolerate\" an integrated school district as long as the percentage of minorities in the local population remains within a \"comfort zone\" of approximately 20%.  As the minority population</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>rises, so do the anxieties of white parents.  When the minority population reaches 40 to 50% of the local population, the studies imply that whites tend to withdraw from school districts in high numbers and seek refuge in more homogeneous communities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this theory of \"tipping\" to a rural district like Goodrich is difficult for two reasons.  First, Dr. Murray admitted on cross examination that he was unaware of any academic study that has found an occurrence of tipping in rural communities.  Although he stated that the phenomenon has occurred in rural Mississippi, he admitted that this observation was purely his own, not part of a formal analysis, and, hence, not subject to rigorous academic scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in urban settings where tipping has been examined, studies suggest that it may be limited to areas where other neighborhoods and school districts are readily accessible.  In urban neighborhoods, families can relocate short distances--within a large metropolitan area or to a nearby suburb--and select among public and private schools.  A rural area like that where Goodrich is located affords fewer choices.  Private schools are less common, and alternative neighborhoods, job opportunities and public school districts tend to be farther away.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, neither the theoretical likelihood of tipping nor its practicability in and around Goodrich is strongly supported.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court found that if the proposed annexation were granted, the \"public perception of [Goodrich I.S.D.] as the Black school district would be strengthened.\"   But perceptions alone cannot form the basis for federal court intervention into the administration of a public school system.  Even assuming the testimony relied upon by the district court accurately reflects community sentiment, this evidence reveals almost nothing about whether the demographic changes Goodrich I.S.D. might undergo in the wake of the proposed boundary change would be the product of private choices or a state-sponsored racial classification.  The court's finding also fails to square with the persistent high turnover of the Goodrich school population, its significant fluctuations in size, and its growing Hispanic contingent--all of which facts are relevant to local perceptions, and all of which are far more significant than a one-time 2.7% population shift.  District courts cannot substitute subjective judgments of this character for a finding of an actual segregative effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's findings of segregative effects are too speculative, or are not supported by the record, or are rooted in private conduct rather than state action, they are clearly erroneous and legally insufficient.  The district court erred in concluding that the proposed boundary change would violate either federal law or the modified order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to consider whether its interpretation of modified order 5281 is in accord with post-1971 Supreme Court decisions.  It rejected this contention of Forest Springs based on the absence of any Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to modify the decree.  Several errors are imbedded in this part of the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, except for the superimposed 1% rule--which connotes impermissible racial balancing \"for its own sake\" rather than a remedy for past state action, Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. at 1447--the pertinent portion of modified order 5281, which deals with boundary changes, is not facially inconsistent with evolving school desegregation jurisprudence.  The gist of post-1971 cases has been to confirm federal courts' broad remedial jurisdiction over those facets of school operations which represent or flow from an earlier de jure discriminatory system, while acknowledging that federal remedial jurisdiction goes only so far as the correction of the constitutional infirmity.  See, e.g., Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 97-98, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 2053-54, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995);  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496-97, 112 S.Ct. at 1448-49;  Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434-37, 96 S.Ct. at 2704-05;  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 282, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2758, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977);  Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 750-53, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3130-31, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974);  Swann, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at 1276.   The modified order, although written broadly, as was necessary at the outset of the court's enforcement efforts, easily lends itself to the reading mandated by the Supreme Court.  The order does not expressly mandate racial balancing in boundary changes.  Cf. Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434, 96 S.Ct. at 2703.   Nor does it expressly detach the consideration of boundary changes from prior unconstitutional state action.  The district court has, in the Hightower ruling, acceded to intervening Fifth Circuit caselaw that rejected trivial statistical population differences as a stand-alone basis for federal intervention.  See Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d at 232.   Put otherwise, since there is no reason why the order must be interpreted to extend the district court's remedial jurisdiction beyond limits articulated by the Supreme Court, prudence and deference to the High Court strongly counsel enforcement of the order consistent with rather than in the teeth of its pronouncements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in light of the compatibility of modified order 5281 with later-articulated law, the district court's insistence on a Rule 60(b) motion as a prerequisite for re-evaluating its modified order is a red herring.  The district court thought that Forest Springs must bear the burden of proving that the entire decree--covering the whole state of Texas--must be vacated or modified in order to justify the Residents' desire to transfer 22 students to Livingston I.S.D. The court's error lies in its perception that the Residents may only claim relief if the order is modified;  because the modified order is limited to a remedy of the effects of past state-imposed segregation, the Residents' burden consisted of demonstrating only that the proposed annexation would not confound the remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, to the extent the district court believed that it lacked the discretion to modify its order sua sponte, it erred.  This court has clearly held that a district court has the authority to modify or terminate a consent decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> sua sponte when it becomes manifest that there has been a change in the facts or the underlying law that gave rise to the decree.  See Williams v. Edwards, 87 F.3d 126, 132 (5th Cir.1996) (\"[T]he district court has the discretion to modify a decree when the court is made aware that the factual circumstances or the law underlying that decree has changed--regardless of the parties' silence or inertia.\");  Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F.3d 1347, 1365-66 (5th Cir.1995).  Moreover, in the context of this old case and the significant clarifications of school desegregation law that have occurred in the quarter-century since the modified order was issued, the court should have been wary of enforcing its order if the court perceived a significant gap between the order and ensuing legal developments.  This error, of course, is irrelevant, where, as here, no such gap appears when the modified order is properly interpreted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Residents of Forest Springs have doggedly pursued their detachment from Goodrich for seven years.  The victory they deserve is now probably Pyrrhic, as their children have grown and their subdivision's legal bills have mounted.  It is most unfortunate that a noble decree to end school segregation has degenerated into a petty war of attrition against 22 students and 360 acres of tax base.  The declaratory judgment of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> District Judge of the Northern District of Texas, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Texas's annexation and detachment statute exists to allow residents of a territory some choice in determining their school district affiliation.

Mandatory desegregation plans limited to central cities with large minority enrollments speed up the decline in white enrollment, at least in the beginning.  Virtually all central cities, however, have experienced a continuing decline in the percent of white students for many years, and declines have been sharp in many cities whether or not they had a desegregation plan.  In cities which have dismantled all or part of their plan, the white enrollment decline continues.  In other words, the basic forces that are producing white enrollment decline go far beyond the school desegregation plan although the plan can accelerate this decline.

The appeals court reasoned that due deference must be accorded the Commissioner's judgment.  In Texas, an agency's determination must be affirmed where it is supported by substantial evidence.  Applying that test, the appeals court concluded that \"[t]he Commissioner's finding that the proposed boundary change would not create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color or national origin is supported by substantial evidence\" and rendered judgment affirming the Commissioner's decision.

Livingston I.S.D., its Board of Trustees, and individual residents of the Forest Springs subdivision who had signed the original petition for detachment and annexation were joined as Defendants-Intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on August 22, 1996, in which evidence was introduced--including the entire administrative record of the proceedings before the TEA--and testimony of lay and expert witnesses was taken.

Although Goodrich's motion for injunctive relief was denied, the district court proceeded to issue a declaratory judgment, holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>After careful consideration of the evidence presented to this court in this proceeding, it is determined that the proposed detachment [of] Forest Springs subdivision from Goodrich and annexation to Livingston Independent School District would reinforce, renew and encourage a dual school system based on race and color, in violation of this court's order of July 17, 1971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residents of Forest Springs filed this timely appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  They argue that the district court erred in (1) finding that under principles of issue preclusion the state court proceedings should not bar Goodrich's subsequent intervention in federal court;  (2) finding that the proposed detachment and annexation would reinforce, renew or encourage a dual school system;  and (3) refusing to apply present standards governing school desegregation law, rather than those set out in the modified order.

Following a favorable ruling from the state appellate courts, the Forest Springs subdivision won the right to be detached from Goodrich and become part of Livingston I.S.D. For the Residents of Forest Springs this victory entitled parents to send their children to a public school system many felt had \"better educational and extracurricular opportunities.\"   Texas Educ. Agency, 898 S.W.2d at 959.   The decision also allowed these citizens to support Livingston I.S.D. with their tax dollars and to participate as members of the local community.

Appellees cite Diamond in support of their position, but their reliance is misplaced.  Diamond was a pediatrician engaged in private practice in Illinois.  After the federal court of appeals declared an Illinois abortion law unconstitutional and the State's attorney general elected not to defend the law any further, Diamond appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Court held that Diamond was unable to satisfy the constitutional requirements of standing because private parties have no judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of state laws.  The Court reasoned that a private citizen cannot compel a state to apply its laws with a particular degree of vigor, nor must the state enact a statute in accord with his wishes.  See Diamond, 476 U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 1705.   As the Court concluded, \"[b]ecause the State alone is entitled to create a legal code, only the State has the kind of 'direct stake' ... in defending the standards embodied in that code.\"  Id. at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 1705.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the appellant in Diamond, the residents of Forest Springs do not pursue this appeal in order to compel the state to enforce its laws, and they are not trying to defend the constitutionality of a legislative judgment in the absence of a state representative.  Instead, the Residents are defending a private right they gained in state court to annex their subdivision to and send their children to school in Livingston I.S.D. These Residents are not merely \"concerned bystanders\" invoking the exercise of judicial power \"simply as a 'vehicle for the vindication of value interests,' \" id. at 62, 106 S.Ct. at 1703 (quoting United States v.

The Commissioner's order required that Forest Springs be annexed to Livingston I.S.D. An order of the Commissioner remains in effect until it is modified or set aside by the courts.  See Temple Indep.  Sch. Dist. v.

A favorable ruling from this court would remove the last obstacle preventing Forest Springs's detachment from Goodrich and annexation to Livingston.  Although a new date for the annexation would be required, state law provides that an appealed decision of the Commissioner becomes effective on a date set by the district court in Travis County.  See Tex.  Educ.Code Ann. &#167; 13.005(c) (West 1996).  Neither the state of Texas nor the Commissioner is required to take any action to effectuate the Commissioner's earlier order.  As a result, the redressability prong as well as the other standards in the Constitution's Article III standing requirement is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Residents argue first that the district court erred in refusing to apply preclusive effect to the final state court judgment, which affirmed the Commissioner's finding that the proposed detachment and annexation would not violate Modified Order 5281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common-law doctrines of issue and claim preclusion ordinarily shield final judicial determinations of administrative bodies, whether under the aegis of federal or state government.

The parties' dispute was litigated to the hilt in state administrative and judicial proceedings, including the issue whether the proposed boundary change violated \"[modified order] 5281 or result[ed] in significant adverse educational, economic or social effects, or whether the boundary changes [were] in the educational interests of the students.\"  Forest Springs Subdivision v.

Technically, as appellees observe, the only issue before the state courts was whether the Commissioner's findings were supported by substantial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  But this is all that issue preclusion requires in the administrative context.  A state court reviewing the decision of an administrative agency need not proceed as though it were writing on tabula rasa.  See Kremer v. Chemical Constr.

The parties never sought to relitigate issues in state court that had been decided by the modified order.  On the contrary, the administrative proceeding before the Commissioner followed the express directive of the modified order, which required the Commissioner to investigate and issue findings concerning how any proposed school boundary change affects the schools' desegregation status and whether it comports with \"the law,\" presumably including modified order 5281.

The court found as matters of fact that if the annexation were approved, it (1) would limit Goodrich's financial ability to run a school district, (2) would create a perception that race is a relevant factor in establishing district boundaries, and (3) would likely trigger further annexations and increased school segregation.  The court interpreted its modified order to incorporate a 1% \"guideline\" for evaluating the resegregative impact of boundary changes on the racial makeup of affected school districts.  Finally, it refused to read the 27-year-old modified order in light of more recent Supreme Court decisions concerning school desegregation decrees.  Portentous significance must flow, in the district court's view, from the detachment of a few hundred acres and 22 students from Goodrich.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the district court, we believe that much less is involved in this minuscule boundary change.  First, it does not contravene even the court's own modified order, properly construed.  Second, the district court's factual findings are either clearly erroneous or too attenuated to demonstrate that the proposed boundary change will result in the creation of a segregated Goodrich school district.  Third, the 27-year-old modified order could and should be interpreted with an eye toward significant intervening Supreme Court precedent.  Each of these points requires elaboration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Modified order 5281 forbids boundary line changes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>which are designed to, or do in fact, create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color, or national origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that the Forest Springs boundary change would reinforce, renew and encourage a racially dual system.  Critical to, though not dispositive of, the court's analysis was its adaptation of a 1% guideline from a separate portion of the decree dealing only with student transfers.

The court considered this percentage \"a useful rule of thumb\" for evaluating the proposed Forest Springs and future boundary changes.  According to the court's arithmetic, the Goodrich school-age population would be 2.7% less white if the boundary change occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Inferentially, the court found that because a 2.7% shift of children is greater than the 1% \"rule of thumb,\" the boundary change presumptively violated modified order 5281.  This reasoning is seriously flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court offers no basis, legal or factual, for its decision to import the 1% transfer standard into the boundary change portion of the decree.  The goal of affording notice to parties affected by the decree is wholly ignored by this ad hoc rewriting.  It matters not, and the court did not rely on the fact, that apparently the Commissioner has also informally followed a 1% rule on boundary changes.  The decree simply has no such limit, and common sense suggests why, even if a 1% rule was justifiable for student transfers, the decree distinguished between student transfers and boundary changes.  Student transfers are much easier for school districts to implement and would have afforded a convenient subterfuge for parties bent on undermining desegregation efforts.  Boundary changes, on the other hand, are permanent, and they irrevocably affect district population, tax base, size and allocation of resources.  Viewing boundary changes solely from the perspective of a tiny transient percentage change in school racial makeup is too rough a measure of their significance.  See Texas Educ. Agency, 898 S.W.2d at 957-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the court characterized its new 1% standard as a rule of thumb, not a rigid benchmark, does not ameliorate the problem, for the decree effectively guides day-to-day school administrative decisions.  Cautious school officials, not to mention unhappy homeowners, will opt not to buy a lawsuit by proposing boundary changes that challenge this low threshold.  One look at the protracted seven-year battle waged by Goodrich against the Forest Springs residents proves the litigation potential inherent in a vague and anachronistically construed remedial order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1% rule of thumb is also a static statistic with little analytical power for measuring segregative population changes.  The district court recognized as much by citing its own earlier order, which stated that the \"one percent guideline ... cannot stand as a benchmark by which to rigidly approve or deny transfers.\"   See order re Intervention of Mary Hightower, C.A. 5281 (Sept. 8, 1980) (permitting student transfers that would increase the white population of the transferor school by 7%).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  In the Hightower order, the district court bowed to governing Fifth Circuit law, which had already come to reject purely quantitative analysis in the desegregation context.

The district court recognized both in Hightower and in this case that the proper inquiry is whether the proposed boundary change would undermine the effectiveness of its plan to remedy specifically identified constitutional violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See, e.g., Lee v.

Goodrich experienced an annual student \"mobility rate\" of about 35%, which means that the population turnover was dramatic.  The population fluctuated significantly both up and down, and an apparent decline in the white student population over several years is attributable to a doubling of Hispanic students.  Amid these seismic shocks, a 1% guideline, or even an actual 2.7% student population change, is barely a tremor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only is the 1% rule of thumb too small to be probative of anything, it is, standing alone, legally insufficient to evaluate compliance with the court's modified order.  Moreover, the 1% \"guideline\" is not and may not be treated as if it were a part of the boundary change portion of the modified order.  The court erred by relying on this \"rule of thumb\" for any purpose concerning the proposed boundary change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the \"violation\" of the newly-minted 1% guideline, the district court found that the boundary change would violate modified order 5281 because it would \"reinforce, renew, and encourage a dual school system based on race and color, in violation of this court's order of July 13, 1971.\"   The district court relied on findings that the proposed annexation would impair Goodrich's ability to run an integrated school district;  would likely trigger further annexations and increased school desegregation;  and would reinforce the perception that school district boundaries were drawn on account of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first found that the money the district would lose in the wake of Forest Springs's detachment would adversely affect the quality of the teaching, the availability of resources (e.g., computers), and the type of programs Goodrich would be able to offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's sub silentio overruling of the Commissioner's finding of no adverse financial impact on Goodrich is troubling.  The Commissioner specifically evaluated the pertinent state law issue whether Forest Springs's detachment would reduce Goodrich's tax base by a ratio at least twice as large as the ratio by which it would reduce student population.  See Texas Educ.Code Ann. &#167; 19.022(d) (West 1991).  It would not, and the parties so stipulated, yet the federal court embarked on its own fact-finding without tether to the standard that Texas law provides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's result is also doubtful standing alone.  According to unchallenged testimony elicited during trial, state and local ad valorem taxes each contribute approximately one-half of the school district's funding.  Using the methodology the district court followed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> the detachment of Forest Springs would result in a loss of approximately 22 students.  Goodrich spends approximately $5,300 per student.  Accordingly, the loss of the Forest Springs students could reduce Goodrich's expenditures by $116,600.  If one-half of this amount were supplied by the state, the remaining $58,300 must have been financed through local ad valorem taxes.  However, Forest Springs's ad valorem contribution to Goodrich I.S.D.'s coffers was only about $52,000, almost $6,300 less than the district spent to educate Forest Springs's children.  From this evidence, the district court should have concluded that Goodrich I.S.D. would actually benefit from the proposed detachment.  In other words, when the boundary change is analyzed with proper regard for cost savings, not merely revenues lost, the resources available to Goodrich to spend on individual pupils would rise following the detachment of Forest Springs.  The evidence does not support the district court's finding that the quality of education within Goodrich I.S.D., as measured by money spent, would be adversely affected merely by the loss of Forest Springs's revenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly problematic is the district court's finding that approval of the boundary change would \"trigger further annexations and increased school segregation.\"   Relying on the opinion of an expert witness, the district court reasoned that the departure of Forest Springs would push the white population one step closer to minority status within Goodrich I.S.D. According to a phenomenon known as \"tipping,\" as whites approach minority status \"white flight\" ensues.  Thus, Goodrich's loss of Forest Springs would accelerate the departure of other white families and would \" 'certainly' make other subdivisions more likely to seek similar detachments and annexations.\"   Neither the law nor the evidence in this case supports such a finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court's authority over the Texas educational system under the venerable desegregation decree is quite broad, the Supreme Court has reminded us that \" 'there are limits' beyond which a court may not go in seeking to dismantle a dual school system.\"  Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v.

The modified order reaches the reinforcement, renewal or encouragement of a dual school system, and it binds public officials to prevent racial segregation.  The key to the order's scope is state action.  Absent any showing that school authorities \"have in some manner caused unconstitutional segregation,\" the district court lacks any power to enjoin a change in school boundaries.  Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434, 96 S.Ct. at 2704;  see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 28, 91 S.Ct. at 1282.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It hardly needs to be added that there is no evidence that the demographic change forecast to occur in Goodrich I.S.D. in the wake of Forest Springs's detachment is in any way attributable to \"segregative actions chargeable to the [State].\"  Spangler, 427 U.S. at 435, 96 S.Ct. at 2704.   Neither the small number of students involved in the instant case, nor the reduction in the white school-age population from 57.8 to 55.1%, taken alone or together, would directly produce a dual school system, and the court did not so find.  The court did not find that the boundary change was itself a vestige of or flowed from a vestige of a dual system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  The court also did not find that the vestiges of a formerly dual school system would be maintained by the proposed boundary change.  The record is uncontroverted that both Goodrich and Livingston voluntarily desegregated many years ago, and neither district was ever subject to a specific local desegregation decree.  Finally, the boundary change will not adversely affect the district's overall financial status.  State action, in short, has not violated the modified order, nor does the proposed boundary change have a segregative effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Residential mobility is a virtue of a free and dynamic society.

No doubt residential choices turn on economic and social considerations or even, at times, on private discrimination, but as long as they remain attributable to individual decisions, born of free choice, they are devoid of constitutional implications.  See Freeman v. Pitts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 495, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although changing residential patterns inevitably affect the racial composition of schools, it is beyond the authority of the federal courts to counteract demographic changes in school districts that are the product of private choice and not state-sanctioned discrimination.  See id. at 495, 112 S.Ct. at 1448.   The district court could not predicate a violation of the modified order on the forecast that individual residential decisions, unrelated to the effect of past segregation, would change the district's racial makeup in the future.  Again, it must be emphasized that the modified order does not reach private conduct but only state action that results in a dual system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if it were relevant, the evidence furnishes weak support for the finding that the loss of Forest Springs would necessarily result in an exodus of white students from Goodrich.  Goodrich's expert, Dr. Richard Murray, testified that studies suggest that white parents will \"tolerate\" an integrated school district as long as the percentage of minorities in the local population remains within a \"comfort zone\" of approximately 20%.  As the minority population</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>rises, so do the anxieties of white parents.  When the minority population reaches 40 to 50% of the local population, the studies imply that whites tend to withdraw from school districts in high numbers and seek refuge in more homogeneous communities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this theory of \"tipping\" to a rural district like Goodrich is difficult for two reasons.  First, Dr. Murray admitted on cross examination that he was unaware of any academic study that has found an occurrence of tipping in rural communities.  Although he stated that the phenomenon has occurred in rural Mississippi, he admitted that this observation was purely his own, not part of a formal analysis, and, hence, not subject to rigorous academic scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in urban settings where tipping has been examined, studies suggest that it may be limited to areas where other neighborhoods and school districts are readily accessible.  In urban neighborhoods, families can relocate short distances--within a large metropolitan area or to a nearby suburb--and select among public and private schools.  A rural area like that where Goodrich is located affords fewer choices.  Private schools are less common, and alternative neighborhoods, job opportunities and public school districts tend to be farther away.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, neither the theoretical likelihood of tipping nor its practicability in and around Goodrich is strongly supported.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court found that if the proposed annexation were granted, the \"public perception of [Goodrich I.S.D.] as the Black school district would be strengthened.\"   But perceptions alone cannot form the basis for federal court intervention into the administration of a public school system.  Even assuming the testimony relied upon by the district court accurately reflects community sentiment, this evidence reveals almost nothing about whether the demographic changes Goodrich I.S.D. might undergo in the wake of the proposed boundary change would be the product of private choices or a state-sponsored racial classification.  The court's finding also fails to square with the persistent high turnover of the Goodrich school population, its significant fluctuations in size, and its growing Hispanic contingent--all of which facts are relevant to local perceptions, and all of which are far more significant than a one-time 2.7% population shift.  District courts cannot substitute subjective judgments of this character for a finding of an actual segregative effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's findings of segregative effects are too speculative, or are not supported by the record, or are rooted in private conduct rather than state action, they are clearly erroneous and legally insufficient.  The district court erred in concluding that the proposed boundary change would violate either federal law or the modified order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to consider whether its interpretation of modified order 5281 is in accord with post-1971 Supreme Court decisions.  It rejected this contention of Forest Springs based on the absence of any Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to modify the decree.  Several errors are imbedded in this part of the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, except for the superimposed 1% rule--which connotes impermissible racial balancing \"for its own sake\" rather than a remedy for past state action, Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. at 1447--the pertinent portion of modified order 5281, which deals with boundary changes, is not facially inconsistent with evolving school desegregation jurisprudence.  The gist of post-1971 cases has been to confirm federal courts' broad remedial jurisdiction over those facets of school operations which represent or flow from an earlier de jure discriminatory system, while acknowledging that federal remedial jurisdiction goes only so far as the correction of the constitutional infirmity.

The modified order, although written broadly, as was necessary at the outset of the court's enforcement efforts, easily lends itself to the reading mandated by the Supreme Court.  The order does not expressly mandate racial balancing in boundary changes.  Cf. Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434, 96 S.Ct. at 2703.   Nor does it expressly detach the consideration of boundary changes from prior unconstitutional state action.  The district court has, in the Hightower ruling, acceded to intervening Fifth Circuit caselaw that rejected trivial statistical population differences as a stand-alone basis for federal intervention.  See Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d at 232.   Put otherwise, since there is no reason why the order must be interpreted to extend the district court's remedial jurisdiction beyond limits articulated by the Supreme Court, prudence and deference to the High Court strongly counsel enforcement of the order consistent with rather than in the teeth of its pronouncements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in light of the compatibility of modified order 5281 with later-articulated law, the district court's insistence on a Rule 60(b) motion as a prerequisite for re-evaluating its modified order is a red herring.  The district court thought that Forest Springs must bear the burden of proving that the entire decree--covering the whole state of Texas--must be vacated or modified in order to justify the Residents' desire to transfer 22 students to Livingston I.S.D. The court's error lies in its perception that the Residents may only claim relief if the order is modified;  because the modified order is limited to a remedy of the effects of past state-imposed segregation, the Residents' burden consisted of demonstrating only that the proposed annexation would not confound the remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, to the extent the district court believed that it lacked the discretion to modify its order sua sponte, it erred.  This court has clearly held that a district court has the authority to modify or terminate a consent decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> sua sponte when it becomes manifest that there has been a change in the facts or the underlying law that gave rise to the decree.  See Williams v. Edwards, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720568\"><a href=\"/opinion/720568/hayes-williams-v-edwin-w-edwards-governor-state-of-louisiana-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 132 (5th Cir.1996) (\"[T]he district court has the discretion to modify a decree when the court is made aware that the factual circumstances or the law underlying that decree has changed--regardless of the parties' silence or inertia.\");  Alberti v.

Moreover, in the context of this old case and the significant clarifications of school desegregation law that have occurred in the quarter-century since the modified order was issued, the court should have been wary of enforcing its order if the court perceived a significant gap between the order and ensuing legal developments.  This error, of course, is irrelevant, where, as here, no such gap appears when the modified order is properly interpreted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Residents of Forest Springs have doggedly pursued their detachment from Goodrich for seven years.

Mandatory desegregation plans limited to central cities with large minority enrollments speed up the decline in white enrollment, at least in the beginning.  Virtually all central cities, however, have experienced a continuing decline in the percent of white students for many years, and declines have been sharp in many cities whether or not they had a desegregation plan.  In cities which have dismantled all or part of their plan, the white enrollment decline continues.  In other words, the basic forces that are producing white enrollment decline go far beyond the school desegregation plan although the plan can accelerate this decline.  On the other hand, analysis of the largest school systems in the United States shows that half of those with the greatest stability of enrollments by race between the 1960s and the mid 1980s had mandatory metropolitan desegregation plans.\"  (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted));  see also Robert A.
