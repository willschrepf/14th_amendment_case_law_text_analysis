Autohaus’s Tax Report and Suit......................................................................7\n\n         A.        Autohaus’s 2009 Franchise Tax Report and the Comptroller’s\n                   Audit ......................................................................................................7\n\n         B.        Autohaus’s Protest Letter and Protest Payment ....................................8\n\n         C.        Autohaus’s suit ....................................................................................10\n\nSummary of Argument ............................................................................................14\n\nArgument..................................................................................................................15\n\nI.       Autohaus’s Installation of Automotive Parts onto or into Customer-\n         Owned Automobiles During Repair or Maintenance Work Is Not the\n         “Production” of Those Parts Under Section 171.1012, and Therefore\n         the Labor Costs for Such Installation May Not Be Deducted as Costs\n         of Goods Sold. ...............................................................................................15\n\n\n\n\n                                                              ii\n\fII.    Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) Is Both Valid and Constitutional. .................15\n\n       A.     Costs of goods sold under section 171.1012 include the cost of\n              acquiring or producing goods for sale, but excludes the cost of\n              providing services................................................................................16\n\n       B.     Section 171.1012 is ambiguous in regard to transactions\n              involving both services and sales and in its use of the word\n              “installation” because the labor involved in installation can take\n              place either in the context of the production of a good for sale\n              (deductible) or in the context of services performed for another\n              (not deductible). Rule 3.588 addresses this ambiguity. ......................17\n\n       C.     Autohaus does not “produce” purchased automotive parts when\n              it installs them onto or into customer-owned automobiles, but\n              rather it engages in a mixed transaction involving a sale of the\n              part and the provision of an automotive repair or maintenance\n              service. Autohaus may deduct as costs of goods sold its cost of\n              acquiring the automotive parts, but may not deduct labor costs\n              for “producing” the parts by installing them onto or into\n              customer-owned automobiles..............................................................20\n\n       D.     Autohaus’s claim also fails under the application of Rule\n              3.588(b)(7), and the Rule is both valid and constitutional ..................25\n\nIII.   Even If a Taxable Entity May Deduct Labor Costs for Installing\n       Automotive Parts onto or into Customer-Owned Automobiles During\n       Repairs as Costs of Goods Sold, Material Issues of Fact Preclude the\n       Granting of Summary Judgment and the Award of a Specific Refund\n       Amount on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 Claim. .................................................37\n\nIV.    The Trial Court Had No Jurisdiction to Consider Autohaus’s\n       Attempted Challenge Under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act to\n       Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) or Its Request for Attorneys’ Fees and\n       Court Costs Because Autohaus’s Claim Did Not Fall Within the\n       Scope of the UDJA and Was, Apart From The Attorneys’ Fees and\n       Court Costs Request, Redundant of Its Chapter 112 Claim. .........................41\n\n\n\n\n                                                     iii\n\f         A.        A trial court may not grant a declaratory judgment regarding the\n                   validity and constitutionality of a rule under the UDJA, and\n                   therefore the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant a\n                   declaratory judgment nor attorney’s fees or court costs under\n                   the UDJA in this case. .........................................................................42\n\n         B.        Autohaus did not raise a claim within the ultra vires exception.........47\n\n         C.        While Texas Government Code section 2001.038 provides\n                   courts with jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgments\n                   regarding the validity of a rule, such provision does not provide\n                   for the award of attorneys’ fees or court costs. Thus even if\n                   Autohaus had raised such a claim, and the trial court had\n                   jurisdiction under section 2001.038 to grant a declaratory\n                   judgment on Rule 3.588(b)(7), it had no jurisdiction to award\n                   attorneys’ fees or court costs. ..............................................................48\n\n         D.        Autohaus may not recover attorneys’ fees or court costs for\n                   redundant claims that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of\n                   Chapter 112. ........................................................................................49\n\n         E.

CR4. Autohaus filed a motion for summary judgment\n                and Appellants filed a response, cross-motion for summary\n                judgment, and plea to the jurisdiction. CR32–84, 93–177. On\n                July 22, 2014, the trial court issued an order granting\n                Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment and denying\n                Appellants’ motion for summary judgment and plea to the\n                jurisdiction. CR196–98. After a bench trial on the amount of\n                attorneys’ fees and court costs to be awarded, the trial court\n                signed a final judgment on April 29, 2015. CR344–49. A\n                motion for new trial was filed on May 29, 2015, and was\n                denied on July 9, 2015. CR350–64, 383. Notice of appeal was\n                filed on July 10, 2015. CR384–85.\n\nTrial Court’s   On April 29, 2015, the trial court entered a final judgment in\nDisposition:    favor of Autohaus, and ordered Appellants to issue a refund\n                of $14,227.09 of Texas franchise tax, plus statutory interest.\n                CR344–49. The trial court also declared that Comptroller\n                Rule 3.588(b)(7), as it applies to the term “production,” is\n                invalid and unconstitutional, and awarded attorneys’ fees and\n                court costs to Autohaus. CR346–48.\n\n\n\n\n                                        x\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      Section 171.1012 of the Tax Code permits a taxable entity to deduct as costs\n\nof goods sold its direct costs of acquiring or producing goods that it sells to\n\ncustomers. Taxable entities may deduct labor costs for producing goods for sale,\n\nincluding   installation   labor.   Comptroller     Rule   3.588(b)(7)    implements\n\nsection 171.1012 and clarifies that installation is production only if the installation\n\noccurs during the manufacturing or construction process.\n\n      This appeal decides whether a taxable entity that purchases goods for sale\n\nmay, in addition to deducting its costs of acquiring such goods for sale, also deduct\n\nlabor costs for “producing” those same goods if it installs those goods onto or into\n\npersonal property belonging to a customer. The appeal also involves an attempted\n\nchallenge to Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) under the Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act (TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 37.001, et. seq.)(“UDJA”), and\n\nthe award of attorneys’ fees thereunder. The specific issues in this appeal are:\n\n    1.       Autohaus’s installation of automotive parts onto or into customer-\n             owned automobiles during repair or maintenance work is not the\n             “production” of those parts under section 171.1012, and therefore the\n             labor costs for such installation may not be deducted as costs of goods\n             sold.\n\n    2.       Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) is both valid and constitutional.\n\n    3.       Even if a taxable entity may deduct labor costs for installing\n             automotive parts onto or into customer-owned automobiles during\n             repairs as costs of goods sold, material issues of fact preclude the\n\n\n\n                                          xi\n\f     granting of summary judgment and the award of a specific refund\n     amount on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim.\n\n4.   The trial court had no jurisdiction to consider Autohaus’s attempted\n     challenge under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act to\n     Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) or its request for attorneys’ fees and\n     court costs because Autohaus’s claim did not fall within the scope of\n     the UDJA and was, apart from the attorneys’ fees and court costs\n     request, redundant of its Chapter 112 claim.\n\n\n\n\n                               xii\n\f                                No. 03-15-00427-CV\n                      ______________________________________\n\n                            In the Court of Appeals\n                         for the Third Judicial District\n                                 Austin, Texas\n                 ________________________________________\n                GLENN HEGAR, COMPTROLLER OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS\n                          OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, AND\n             KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF TEXAS,\n                                             Appellants,\n\n                                             V.\n\n                             AUTOHAUS LP, LLP,\n                                            Appellees.\n                __________________________________________\n\n     On Appeal from the 419th Judicial District Court, Travis County, Texas\n             __________________________________________\n\n                                 APPELLANTS’ BRIEF\n                __________________________________________\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES OF THE THIRD COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Autohaus seeks to deduct, as costs of goods sold, its labor costs for\n\n“producing” purchased automotive parts when it installs those parts onto or into a\n\ncustomer’s automobile during repairs or maintenance. Autohaus’s claim fails\n\nbecause its installation of an automotive part onto or into a customer’s automobile\n\nis not the “production” of that part and is not a cost of Autohaus “acquiring or\n\nproducing”     that     part   for   sale.   Autohaus’s   challenge   to   Comptroller\n\nRule 3.588(b)(7) likewise fails because the rule properly and constitutionally\n\n\n                                             1\n\fimplements the Legislature’s intent that services not be deductible as costs of\n\ngoods sold and that a business may only deduct installation labor as costs of\n\nproducing a good for sale when materials are installed onto or into personal\n\nproperty that the business owns and is actually producing for sale.\n\n       Autohaus’s attempted declaratory judgment claim under the UDJA fails\n\nbecause it does not fall within the scope of the UDJA and, apart from an improper\n\nrequest for attorneys’ fees and court costs, it requests relief redundant of the issues\n\nin its Chapter 112 claim.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court should be reversed, the declaratory judgment\n\nportion dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and judgment rendered in favor of\n\nAppellants or, alternatively, the case remanded for a new trial.\n\n                                 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.     STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\n\n       The franchise tax imposes a tax on business entities in Texas for the\n\nprivilege of doing business in Texas. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.001(a). At the time at\n\nissue in this appeal, for business entities with more than $10,000,000 in total\n\nrevenue1 like Autohaus, the determination of the amount of franchise tax due first\n\n\n\n1\n   Businesses with less than $10,000,000 in revenue also had, and continue to have, the option of\nusing total revenue instead of margin as their tax base, but that provision is not relevant to this\nappeal. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1016.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\frequired the computation of the entity’s margin, which was the lesser of: (1) 70%\n\nof total revenue; (2) an amount computed by subtracting cost of goods sold from\n\ntotal revenue; or (3) an amount computed by subtracting compensation paid to\n\nemployees during the reporting period from total revenue. 2 Act of May 2, 2006,\n\n79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 8 (former TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.101(a)), current version at TEX. TAX CODE § 171.101(a)(1). While section\n\n171.101(a) was amended to allow for an alternative means to determine margin,\n\nthe subtraction of costs of goods sold from total revenue remains as an option for\n\ntaxpayers. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.101(a)(1)(B)(ii)(a)(1).\n\n       A.     Texas Tax Code Section 171.1012\n\n       The calculation of cost of goods sold is governed by Tax Code section\n\n171.1012, which permits a business to subtract certain of its costs to acquire or\n\nproduce the goods sold. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (b), (c). “Goods” are\n\nreal or tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of business of a\n\ntaxable entity, but do not include any services. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1),\n\n(a)(3)(B)(ii). The entity must own the goods that it sells in order to make a\n\nsubtraction for cost of goods sold. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(i). Among the costs\n\n\n\n2\n  Once the margin is calculated, a percentage of that margin is then apportioned to Texas, and\nthat portion of the margin is subject to tax at the rate of 0.5% for qualifying retailers and\nwholesalers and 1.0% for all other taxable entities. TEX. TAX CODE §§ 171.106; 171.002(a), (b).\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat may be included as cost of goods sold are labor costs to acquire the goods or to\n\nproduce the goods. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(1). If an entity produced the\n\ngoods that it sold, it may include its cost of materials that are an integral part of the\n\nspecific property produced or which are consumed in the ordinary course of\n\nperforming production activities. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(2), (c)(3).\n\nProduction includes “construction, installation, manufacture, development, mining,\n\nextraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth.” TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(2).\n\n      The language of these subsections remains unchanged from the time of their\n\ninitial enactment in January 1, 2008. Cf. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012 to Act of\n\nMay 2, 2006, 79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 13–16.\n\n      B.     Comptroller Rule 3.588\n\n      In September 2007, following the passage of the enacting legislation for\n\nSection 171.1012, the Comptroller proposed Rule 3.588 to implement section\n\n171.1012. See 32 Tex. Reg. 6288, 6288–92 (2007). The rule was adopted on\n\nDecember 28, 2007, and it went into effect on January 1, 2008, the same day as\n\nsection 171.1012. See 32 Tex. Reg. 10034, 10034–38 (2007).\n\n      Among the provisions of Rule 3.588 that are relevant to this appeal are the\n\nfollowing subsections, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      (b)    Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this\n             section, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly\n             indicates otherwise.\n\n             (3)   Goods—Real or tangible personal property sold in the\n                   ordinary course of business of a taxable entity.\n\n             (7)   Production—Construction, manufacture, installation\n                   occurring during the manufacturing or construction\n                   process, development, mining, extraction, improvement,\n                   creation, raising, or growth;\n\n             (10) Tangible personal property—\n                  (B) does not include:\n                        (ii) services.\n\n      (c)    General rules for determining costs of goods sold.\n\n             (7)   Mixed transactions. If a transaction contains elements of\n                   both a sale of tangible personal property and a service, a\n                   taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the\n                   costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to the\n                   tangible personal property sold;\n\n             (8)   Owner of goods. A taxable entity may make a subtraction\n                   under this section only if that entity owns the goods.\n\n34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.588(b)(3), (b)(7), (b)(10)(b)(ii), (c)(7), (c)(8). These\n\nsubsections have been in force and unchanged, apart from some renumbering,\n\nsince January 1, 2008. Cf. 32 Tex. Reg. at 10035–36 to 38 Tex. Reg. 3415, 3417–\n\n18 (2013). Also pertinent are subsections (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3), which were\n\namended in 2013 for clarity and to better conform with applicable federal law and\n\nsection 171.1012. See 38 Tex. Reg. at 3416, 3419. As originally enacted and in\n\neffect at the time of Autohaus’s claim, those subsections read:\n\n\n                                         5\n\f          (d)    Costs of goods sold. The cost of goods sold includes all direct costs of\n                 acquiring or producing the goods, including:\n\n                 (1)     labor costs including W-2 wages, IRS Form 1099 wages,\n                         temporary labor, payroll taxes and benefits;\n\n                 (2)     cost of materials that are an integral part of specific\n                         property produced; [and]\n\n                 (3)     cost of materials that are consumed in the course of\n                         performing production activities[.]\n\n32 Tex. Reg. at 10036–37 (2007) (current version at 34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n\n§ 3.588(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3)). 3\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Those sections currently read:\n\n(d) Direct costs. The cost of goods sold includes all direct costs of acquiring or producing the\n    goods. Direct costs include:\n\n          (1) Labor costs. A taxable entity may include in its costs of goods sold\n          calculation labor costs, other than service costs, that are properly allocable to the\n          acquisition or production of goods and are of the type subject to capitalization or\n          allocation under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.263A-1(e) or 1.460-5 as direct\n          labor costs, indirect labor costs, employee benefit expenses, or pension and other\n          related costs, without regard to whether the taxable entity is required to or actually\n          capitalizes such costs for federal income tax purposes;\n\n          (2) Incorporated materials. A taxable entity may include in its costs of goods sold\n          calculation the cost of materials that are an integral part of specific property\n          produced.\n\n          (3) Consumable materials. A taxable entity may include in its costs of goods sold\n          calculation the cost of materials that are consumed in the ordinary course of\n          performing production activities.\n\n34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.588(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fII.   AUTOHAUS’S TAX REPORT AND SUIT\n\n      A.

CR56.\n\n      In 2009, Autohaus filed its franchise tax report for Report Year 2009\n\ncovering its business activities from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, and\n\napplied a cost-of-goods-sold deduction in the amount of $122,210,985 to calculate\n\na taxable margin in the amount of $17,334,147. CR59. Using such deduction,\n\nAutohaus reported that it owed franchise taxes in the amount of $86,564. CR60.\n\nAutohaus’s claimed cost-of-goods deduction included costs incurred in selling\n\nautomobiles (“Selling Costs”), costs of labor and materials to repair automobiles\n\n(“Repair Costs”), and costs of subcontracted labor and materials to repair\n\nautomobiles (“Subletting Costs”). CR57.\n\n      In the spring of 2012, the Comptroller conducted an audit of Autohaus’s\n\n2009 franchise tax report. CR127. Autohaus was requested to provide records\n\nnecessary to conduct the audit, including cost-of-goods-sold workpapers. CR127.\n\nDuring the conduct of the audit, it was determined that Autohaus was deducting\n\nlabor costs (both for its own employees and for its subcontractors) for maintenance\n\nand repairs on customer-owned automobiles as cost of goods sold. CR128. The\n\nComptroller disallowed those deductions, but allowed cost-of-goods-sold\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fdeductions for both labor and automobile parts when Autohaus provided\n\ndocumentation that the work was part of production activity on a car owned by\n\nAutohaus prior to offering it for sale in the ordinary course of business. CR128.\n\nThe Comptroller also allowed cost-of-goods-sold deductions for the cost of any\n\nautomobile parts used in any repair performed by Autohaus or its subcontractors\n\nwhen Autohaus provided supporting documentation. CR128.\n\n      On December 5, 2012, following the audit of Autohaus’s 2009 franchise tax\n\nreport, the Comptroller disallowed a portion of the claimed cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction, totaling $2,481,302, and adjusted the cost-of-goods-sold deduction to\n\n$119,729,683, resulting in additional franchise tax due by Autohaus of $12,384.18.\n\nCR68, 139–40, 142. The disallowed costs were in five categories labeled by\n\nAutohaus as follows: (1) SRV CUST LBR MB; (2) SRV WARR LAB M/B; (3)\n\nSRV SUBLET RPR M/B; (4) CUST LBR-MECH L/T; and (5) 4Y/50K MAINT\n\nMB. CR70, 140.\n\n      B.    Autohaus’s Protest Letter and Protest Payment\n\n      On January 14, 2013, Autohaus tendered to the Comptroller a protest\n\npayment of the additional franchise tax assessed and the interest due thereon, a\n\ntotal of $14,227.09, along with a written protest letter. CR148, 13–16, 71–76,\n\n153–58; see TEX. TAX CODE § 112.051 (requiring payment of taxes at issue due\n\nalong with written protest as a prerequisite for filing suit under Subchapter B of\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fChapter 112 of the Tax Code); TEX. TAX CODE § 112.052 (permitting the filing of\n\na suit against the state to recover taxes required to be paid to the state if the person\n\nhas first paid the tax at issue under protest); TEX. TAX CODE § 112.053(b) (limiting\n\nthe issues to be determined in the suit to those arising from the reasons expressed\n\nin the written protest as originally filed).\n\n      In its protest letter, Autohaus explained that its costs-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction included costs incurred in selling automobiles (“Selling Costs”), in\n\nrepairing automobiles (“Repair Costs”), and in subletting such repair work to\n\nothers (“Subletting Costs”). CR13, 71, 153. Autohaus specified that the only\n\nmatters at issue were the disallowed costs-of-goods-sold deductions for Repair\n\nCosts and Subletting Costs incurred in repairing automobiles. CR14, 72, 154.\n\n      Under the “Statement of Grounds for Protest” section of its protest letter,\n\nAutohaus asserted generally that it was entitled to include as costs of goods sold:\n\n      (1)    “all of its Repair Costs, including labor costs, and all of its\n             Subletting Costs, including labor costs and costs of materials;”\n             or alternatively,\n\n      (2)    “the costs of materials that were included in its Subletting\n             Costs.”\n\nCR14, 72, 154. Autohaus also listed twelve additional specific assertions in the\n\nprotest letter under its “Statement of Grounds for Protest”, including that:\n\n            the Comptroller’s Rule 3.588(b)(7) “does not properly reflect\n             legislative intent and is therefore invalid” (No. 5);\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f           the Comptroller’s denial of “[Autohaus’s] right to include” the Repair\n            Costs and Subletting Costs at issue as costs of goods sold, “while\n            permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to includes such costs as\n            costs of goods sold”\n\n               o “results in the disparate treatment of taxpayers within the same\n                 class” in violation of the equal and uniform taxation\n                 requirement of “Section 1 of Article VIII of the Texas\n                 Constitution” (No.8);\n\n               o “constitutes the imposition of unequal rights among taxpayers\n                 and the granting of an exclusive separate privilege to certain\n                 taxpayers in violation of Section 3 of Article I of the Texas\n                 Constitution” (No.9);\n\n               o “constitutes a violation of [Autohaus’s] rights under the Equal\n                 Protection Clause of the United States Constitution” (Nos.10\n                 and 11); and\n\n               o “constitutes a violation of [Autohaus’s] rights under the Due\n                 Process Clause of the United States Constitution” (No.12).\n\nCR14–16, 72–74, 154–56. Autohaus tendered with its letter a protest payment of\n\n$14,227.09. CR17–18, 157–58.\n\n      C.    Autohaus’s suit\n\n      On March 22, 2013, Autohaus filed suit against Appellants “pursuant to\n\nChapters 112 and 171 of the Texas Tax Code,” and raised five claims:\n\n      •     “Plaintiff is Entitled to Include Labor Costs in its Cost of\n            Goods Sold Deduction;”\n\n      •     Plaintiff is Entitled to Include Subletting Costs in its Cost\n            of Goods Sold Deduction;”\n\n      •     “The Comptroller’s Assessment of Tax Violates\n            Plaintiff’s Rights Under the Texas Constitution;”\n\n\n                                         10\n\f•     “The Comptroller’s Assessment of Tax Violates\n      Plaintiff’s Rights Under the U.S. Constitution;” and\n\n•     “Plaintiff is Entitled to Declaratory Judgment and\n      Recovery of Attorney’s Fees under the Texas Uniform\n      Declaratory Judgment Act.”\n\nCR4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 151, 163, 165, 166, 168. As relief, Autohaus prayed for:\n\n(1)   a judgment for a refund of the $14,227.09 in taxes and interest that\n      were paid under protest;\n\n(2)   statutory interest on the same;\n\n(3)   costs of court;\n\n(4)   declarations under the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act\n      (“UDJA”) that:\n\n      (a)   “[Autohaus] is entitled to a refund of the $14,227.09 in\n            franchise tax and interest it paid under protest;”\n\n      (b)   “The Comptroller’s collection of tax is invalid because the\n            Comptroller has denied [Autohaus’s] rights to equal protection\n            and equal and uniform taxation;”\n\n      (c)   “The Comptroller’s collection of tax violates [Autohaus’s]\n            equal protection and due process rights under the United States’\n            Constitution and is therefore invalid;” and\n\n      (d)   “The Comptroller’s collection of tax violates the equal and\n            uniform taxation provision of the Texas Constitution and is\n            therefore invalid;”\n\n(5)   “Recovery of attorney’s fees as authorized by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n      Code § 37.009;”\n\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\falong with “[s]uch other relief as to which Plaintiff is justly entitled in law or\n\nequity.” CR11, 12, 168, 169.\n\n      Autohaus filed Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Incorporated\n\nBrief on May 23, 2014. CR32–84. Appellants filed Defendants’ Response to\n\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and Defendants’ Plea to the Jurisdiction on June 17, 2014. CR93–177.\n\nThe trial court heard both sets of motions on July 9, 2014, and on July 22, 2014\n\nissued orders granting Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment and denying\n\nAppellants’ cross-motion for summary judgment and plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nCR196–98.\n\n      In its order granting Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment, the trial\n\ncourt ordered that Autohaus was entitled to: (1) “include all of its labor costs\n\nassociated with Repair Costs and all of its labor costs and materials costs\n\nassociated with Subletting Costs involved in the installation of automotive parts in\n\nits cost of goods sold deduction;” (2) “a refund of the $14,227.09 in franchise tax\n\nthat it paid in protest;” (3) “[statutory] interest accruing on the amount of\n\n[Autohaus’s] refund claim;” and (4) “attorneys’ fees.” CR197–98. The trial court\n\nalso ruled that “Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n\n“production” is unconstitutional and invalid[.]” CR197. Appellants filed a motion\n\nfor reconsideration that was denied on October 30, 2014. CR260.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f      A bench trial was held on April 21, 2015 to determine the amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees and court costs to be awarded. CR344–45; 2RR5–7. Following the\n\nhearing, the trial court signed a “Proposed Final Judgment,” CR337–41, but later\n\nvacated it and issued a final judgment signed on April 29, 2015. CR344–49. The\n\nCourt’s final judgment, which incorporated its July 22, 2014 rulings, ordered that\n\nAutohaus recover from Appellants “the following specific relief:\n\n      A.    Plaintiff is entitled to include all of its labor costs associated with\n            Repair Costs and all of its labor costs and materials costs associated\n            with Subletting Costs involved in the installation of automotive parts\n            in its cost of goods sold deduction.\n\n      B.    Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n            ‘production’ is unconstitutional and invalid.\n\n      C.    Plaintiff is entitled a refund of the $14,227.09 in franchise tax that it\n            paid in protest.\n\n      D.    Plaintiff is entitled to interest accruing on the amount of its refund\n            claim as provided under Texas Tax Code § 112.060 and Texas Tax\n            Code § 112.058(a)(4)[.]”\n\nCR346–47. The court also awarded Autohaus court costs in the amount of $274.80\n\nand “reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees incurred in pursuing its claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief” in certain specified amounts for trial and appeal. CR347.\n\n      Appellants filed a motion for new trial on May 29, 2015, which was denied,\n\nand notice of appeal was filed on July 10, 2015. CR 350–64, 383, 384–85.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f                           SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim fails because its labor costs for installing\n\npurchased automotive parts into or onto customers’ automobiles during repairs are\n\nnot costs of “acquiring or producing” the automotive parts. Autohaus purchases the\n\nparts for resale and so may deduct its costs of acquiring the parts; it does not\n\nproduce the parts and so cannot deduct production costs. Autohaus’s installation of\n\nthe parts is not production of the parts, but rather a mixed transaction involving a\n\nsale of goods (automotive parts), and the provision of services (repairs). For\n\ninstallation labor to be a production cost, an entity must be installing materials onto\n\nor into property that it owns and is producing for sale. Autohaus does not own the\n\ncustomer’s automobiles onto or into which the automotive parts are installed nor is\n\nit producing the customer’s automobiles for sale.\n\n      Autohaus’s challenge to Rule 3.588(b)(7) fails because the rule validly and\n\nconstitutionally implements the Legislature’s intent in Tax Code section 171.1012,\n\nand Autohaus provided no evidence supporting its constitutional challenges.\n\n      Autohaus’s attempted UDJA claim fails because a challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality or validity of an administrative rule does not fall within the scope\n\nof the UDJA, and Autohaus’s claim was redundant of, and preempted by, its\n\nChapter 112 claim.      The court had no jurisdiction to grant any declaratory\n\njudgment or award attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\nI.    AUTOHAUS’S INSTALLATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PARTS ONTO OR INTO\n      CUSTOMER-OWNED AUTOMOBILES DURING REPAIR OR MAINTENANCE\n      WORK IS NOT THE “PRODUCTION” OF THOSE PARTS UNDER SECTION\n      171.1012, AND THEREFORE THE LABOR COSTS FOR SUCH INSTALLATION\n      MAY NOT BE DEDUCTED AS COSTS OF GOODS SOLD.\nII.   COMPTROLLER RULE 3.588(b)(7) IS BOTH VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL.\n                                  (Argued Jointly)\n\n      In its Tax Code Chapter 112 claim for a refund of franchise taxes paid under\n\nprotest, Autohaus seeks to deduct labor costs for repair work performed on\n\ncustomer-owned automobiles as costs of goods sold when automotive parts are\n\ninstalled during the repair. Autohaus asserts that when repair work includes the\n\ninstallation of an automobile part, it is not a repair service to the customer, but the\n\nact of producing an automotive part for sale, and therefore both the actual cost of\n\nthe part and the labor costs of the repair are deductible as costs of producing the\n\nautomotive part.\n\n      But while Autohaus is correct that it may deduct its costs of acquiring the\n\nautomotive parts that it later sells as part of a repair to a customer-owned\n\nautomobile—i.e., its actual costs to purchase the part—it may not also deduct labor\n\ncosts for “producing” that same part when installing it onto or into a customer’s\n\nautomobile during those repairs. All of the labor costs that are at issue in this case\n\nwere incurred by Autohaus when providing a mechanic to perform the service of\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\frepairing customer’s automobiles. Autohaus does not “produce” the automotive\n\nparts that its mechanics install during repairs of customer’s vehicles; its only costs\n\nof “acquiring or producing” the parts for sale are its costs of purchasing those\n\nparts. It is therefore not entitled to deduct repair services labor as costs of goods\n\nsold.\n\n        Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) clarifies that only installation done as a part of\n\nmanufacturing or construction can be considered “production.” Contrary to\n\nAutohaus’s contentions, the Rule does not conflict with either Tax Code section\n\n171.1012 or the Texas or U.S. Constitutions.            Moreover, even without the\n\napplication of Rule 3.588(b)(7) to Autohaus’s claim, Autohaus’s Chapter 112\n\nclaim fails because Autohaus does not produce the automotive parts that it\n\npurchases for sale to its customers as part of its repair services.\n\n        A.    Costs of goods sold under section 171.1012 include the cost of\n              acquiring or producing goods for sale, but excludes the cost of\n              providing services.\n\n        At its most fundamental level, section 171.1012 creates certain threshold\n\nrequirements for the deduction of costs as costs of goods sold.\n\n        Firstly, a taxable entity must have sold “goods”—i.e., real or tangible\n\npersonal property, but not services—in the ordinary course of its business. TEX.\n\nTAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(3)(A), (a)(3)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f      Secondly, the taxable entity must have had costs of “acquiring or producing”\n\nthe goods that it sold, because it is the direct costs of the entity in acquiring or\n\nproducing these goods for sale that are deductible as costs of goods sold. TEX. TAX\n\nCODE § 171.1012(c).\n\n      The more detailed descriptions under section 171.1012 of what specific costs\n\nqualify to be deducted must be considered in light of these two threshold\n\nrequirements. Consistent with these threshold requirements, the Legislature\n\nrequires that the taxable entity be the actual owner of the “real or tangible personal\n\nproperty” that will be “sold in the ordinary course of business.” TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(3), (i). Thus, a taxable entity may not deduct as costs of\n\ngoods sold either the costs of performing services or the costs of acquiring or\n\nproducing goods that it does not own or that it does not sell. TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(3)(B)(ii), (i).\n\n      B.     Section 171.1012 is ambiguous in regard to transactions involving\n             both services and sales and in its use of the word “installation”\n             because the labor involved in installation can take place either in\n             the context of the production of a good for sale (deductible) or in\n             the context of services performed for another (not deductible).\n             Rule 3.588 addresses this ambiguity.\n\n      Section 171.1012(c) allows the deduction of all direct costs for “acquiring or\n\nproducing the goods” sold, including labor costs and “materials that are an integral\n\npart of specific property produced” or “materials that are consumed in the ordinary\n\ncourse of performing production activities.” TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(1), (2),\n\n\n                                         17\n\f(3). Section 171.1012(a)(2) defines “production” as including “construction,\n\ninstallation, manufacture, development, mining, extraction, improvement, creation,\n\nraising, or growth.” TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(2).\n\n      However, section 171.1012 does not detail how “mixed transactions” that\n\nmay involve both the sale of a good and the provision of a service—such as auto\n\nrepairs, hair styling, and medical care—are to be handled. Likewise, section\n\n171.1012 does not define the term “installation.” This creates a latent ambiguity as\n\npersonal property can be installed either onto or into property owned by another\n\nparty during the rendition of a service for that party (e.g., the installation of hair\n\nextensions onto a person’s hair during styling of a customer’s hair), or onto or into\n\nproperty owned by the business entity in the course of producing a good for sale by\n\nthat entity (e.g., installing hair, beads, or feathers onto a hair extension which will\n\nthen be sold to a customer). Both of these ambiguities in the administration of the\n\nstatute can be addressed by an administrative rule promulgated by the Comptroller.\n\nSee Zimmer US, Inc. v. Combs, 368 S.W.3d 579, 586 (Tex. App.—Austin 2012, no\n\npet.)(holding that Comptroller may address ambiguity in administration of statute\n\nby administrative rule and noting that “[T]he legislature does not need to include\n\nevery specific detail or anticipate all unforeseen circumstances.”) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted); see also TEX. TAX CODE § 111.002(a) (providing\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fComptroller authority to adopt rules for enforcement of Tax Code provisions and\n\ncollection of taxes).\n\n      The Comptroller addressed both of these ambiguities in Rule 3.588,\n\nspecifically in subsections (c)(7)(“Mixed transactions”)—providing that if “a\n\ntransaction contains elements of both a sale of tangible personal property and a\n\nservice, a taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the costs otherwise\n\nallowed by this section in relation to the tangible personal property sold”—and in\n\n(b)(7), which specifies that installation in the context of production means\n\n“installation occurring during the manufacturing or construction process.” 34 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE § 3.588 (b)(7), (c)(7).\n\n      Subsections (b)(7) and (c)(7) of Rule 3.588 clarify that where there is a\n\nmixed transaction involving a service that includes the installation of a product\n\nowned by a business onto or into property owned by a customer, the installation\n\nlabor retains its character as a service to the customer and so is not deductible as a\n\ncost of goods sold; rather, only the cost of the actual product owned by the\n\nbusiness and sold to the customer is deductible as a cost of goods sold. See 34 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE § 3.588(b)(7), (c)(7). If, however, the business itself installs a\n\nproduct owned by the business onto or into property owned by the business for\n\npurposes of producing a good for sale in the ordinary course of business, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\finstallation labor in that case is part of the production of the good for sale and so\n\ndeductible as a cost of goods sold. See 34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.588 (b)(7).\n\n      C.     Autohaus does not “produce” purchased automotive parts when it\n             installs them onto or into customer-owned automobiles, but\n             rather it engages in a mixed transaction involving a sale of the\n             part and the provision of an automotive repair or maintenance\n             service. Autohaus may deduct as costs of goods sold its cost of\n             acquiring the automotive parts, but may not deduct labor costs\n             for “producing” the parts by installing them onto or into\n             customer-owned automobiles.\n\n      The Texas Legislature, recognizing that some businesses purchase goods for\n\nsale and others produce goods for sale, permits a taxable entity to deduct as costs\n\nof goods sold its direct costs of “acquiring or producing” the goods that it sells.\n\nTEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c). Autohaus purchases automotive parts for resale to\n\nits customers as part of repairs and so is entitled to deduct its direct costs of\n\nacquiring automotive parts that it sold. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c). The\n\nComptroller recognized this in its audit and allowed such deduction for any\n\namount that Autohaus established as purchase costs for automotive parts sold.\n\nCR128. The Comptroller has always maintained that Autohaus is entitled to a cost-\n\nof-goods-sold deduction for its costs of purchasing automotive parts that it sold in\n\nthe ordinary course of business, including parts sold as part of repair and\n\nmaintenance work, and it provided Autohaus an opportunity to present those costs\n\nduring the audit. CR128.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      Autohaus, however, claims that it is entitled to deductions for both costs of\n\n“acquiring” the automotive parts (their purchase price), and costs of “producing”\n\nthose same purchased automotive parts. Autohaus theorizes that because section\n\n171.1012(a)(2) states that “‘Production’ includes . . . installation,” Autohaus’s act\n\nof installing the purchased automotive parts onto or into customer’s automobiles\n\nduring repairs is “producing” those parts for sale, and it may deduct its labor costs\n\nfor those repairs as costs of “production.” Autohaus misunderstands and misapplies\n\nsection 171.1012.\n\n      Firstly, section 171.1012(c) provides for the deduction of costs of “acquiring\n\nor producing” the goods that an entity sells—in other words, the cost to buy or the\n\ncost to make those goods. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(emphasis added).\n\nAutohaus does not make the automobile parts that it sells; it purchases them.\n\nCR57, 128. As discussed infra, the act of installing them onto or into a customer’s\n\nautomobile does not render Autohaus the “producer” of those purchased parts.\n\n      Secondly, section 171.1012(a)(2) does not state that every occasion of every\n\nact named therein is the production of a good for sale, nor is it reasonable to apply\n\nsuch a broad interpretation. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(2). Not every act of\n\n“improvement,” or “growth,” or “raising,” for example, is the production of a good\n\nfor sale. Rather, the subsection names acts that may be “include[d]” in the\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fproduction of goods for sale for those entities that make rather than buy goods for\n\nsale. See id.\n\n       Words must be interpreted in their statutory context. TGS-NOPEC\n\nGeophysical Co. v. Combs, 340 S.W.3d 432, 441 (Tex. 2011). The scope of a\n\ngeneral word is therefore constrained by its statutory context. When a statute uses\n\n“words of a general nature” in connection with “particular objects or classes of\n\npersons or things, the meaning of the general words will be restricted to the\n\nparticular designation.” Hilco Elec. Coop. v. Midlothian Butane Gas Co., Inc., 111\n\nS.W.3d 75, 81 (Tex. 2003). Thus “installation,” as used in the context of\n\n“production” in section 171.1012, should not be construed as applying to\n\ninstallations that are not a part of actually producing a good for sale.\n\n       This is particularly significant in the case of installation. The distinction\n\nbetween installing personal property onto or into property owned by a customer, or\n\nonto or into property owned by the business, is critical in determining whether the\n\ninstallation labor is a service by the business, and so not deductible, or part of\n\nproduction costs for the business, and therefore deductible. Section 171.1012\n\nhighlights this distinction by specifying that a business may only “make a\n\nsubtraction under this section in relation to the cost of goods sold only if that entity\n\nowns the goods” which are sold. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (i). Section\n\n171.1012 further makes clear that in the context of the production of goods, the\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fbusiness must own the property onto or into which materials are being installed in\n\norder for the installation to be “production” because, in order to be direct costs of\n\nproducing a good, materials must be “an integral part of specific property\n\nproduced.” TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(2).\n\n      In the context of installation of parts onto or into an automobile, the item or\n\n“good” being “produced” by the “installation” of “materials” is the automobile—\n\nnot the automotive part which, in the context of “installation,” is the “material”\n\nbeing installed onto or into the “good.” Thus, in order to deduct the costs of\n\ninstalling automotive parts onto or into an automobile as costs of producing the\n\ngood (the automobile), Autohaus must own the automobile onto or into which the\n\nparts are being installed. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(2), (c)(2), (i).\n\nHere Autohaus is seeking the deduction of labor for repairs only on customer-\n\nowned automobiles. Its installation of parts in that context is a service installation,\n\nwhich is not deductible under section 171.1012, and not a production cost for the\n\nproduction of an automobile that Autohaus owns and is preparing for sale.\n\n      Autohaus asserts that the good that it is “producing” is the automotive parts,\n\nbut its argument that it “produces” automotive parts by installing them is a\n\ntautology. Installed materials must be “an integral part of the specific property\n\nproduced” in order to be deductible as costs of “producing” a good. See TEX. TAX\n\nCODE § 171.1012(c)(2). Thus if the “goods” being produced are the automotive\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fparts, then the material “installed”—here, the automotive parts—must be an\n\nintegral part of the automotive parts being produced.            In other words, the\n\nautomotive parts must be installed onto or into themselves and be an integral part\n\nof themselves. Autohaus’s contention that it may “produce” a good by installing\n\nthat same good is an unreasonable construction of subsections 171.1012(a)(2) and\n\n(c)(1).\n\n          Rather, for Autohaus to be able to receive a deduction for “installation”\n\nrelative to the “production” of an automotive part, it must be installing some\n\nmaterial onto or into that automotive part which becomes an integral part of the\n\nautomotive part. For example, if Autohaus made a refurbished engine for the\n\npurpose of selling that engine to a customer, and in the course of making that\n\nengine it installed screws which became an integral part of that engine, Autohaus\n\ncould claim the costs of the screws as materials used in the production of the\n\nengine and could claim the costs of labor to make that engine, including the labor\n\nto install the screws.\n\n          But that is not the case here. Autohaus did not install anything onto or into\n\nthe automotive parts to “produce” them; it simply acquired them by purchase.\n\nAutohaus’s act of installing purchased automobile parts onto or into customers’\n\nautomobiles as part of repairs is not the “production” of the automotive parts, but\n\nrather simply a mixed transaction involving both the sale of a good (the automotive\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fpart) and the rendering of a service (the repair labor). Under the plain language of\n\nComptroller Rule 3.588(c)(7), which was not challenged in this case, if “a\n\ntransaction contains elements of both a sale of tangible personal property and a\n\nservice, a taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the costs otherwise\n\nallowed by this section in relation to the tangible personal property sold”—in this\n\ncase, its actual cost of purchasing the automotive parts. 34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n\n§ 3.588(c)(7).\n\n      Autohaus’s claim for a cost-of-goods-sold deduction for labor costs in\n\n“producing” automotive parts by installing them onto or into customer-owned\n\nautomobiles should be denied. The portion of the trial court’s judgment granting\n\nAutohaus’s Chapter 112 claim seeking a refund of franchise taxes paid in protest\n\nand all relief granted thereunder should be reversed and a take-nothing judgment\n\nentered in favor of Appellants.\n\n      D.     Autohaus’s claim also fails under the application of Rule\n             3.588(b)(7), and the Rule is both valid and constitutional\n\n      The above analysis demonstrates that Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim fails\n\neven without the application of Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) which Autohaus\n\nchallenges. Autohaus’s claim also fails when the language of Comptroller Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) is applied, as Autohaus’s installation of the automotive parts did not\n\noccur “during the manufacturing or construction process” of the automotive parts,\n\nbut during the course of repairs to customer’s automobiles. See 34 TEX. ADMIN.\n\n\n                                         25\n\fCODE § 3.588(b)(7); CR 56; BFI Waste Systems of N. America, Inc. v. Martinez\n\nEnvtl. Grp., 93 S.W.3d 570, 575 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, pet. denied) (holding\n\nthat valid agency rules have same force and effect as statutes). For this reason\n\nalso, the portion of the trial court’s judgment on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim and\n\nall relief thereunder should be reversed and a take-nothing judgment entered in\n\nfavor of Appellants.\n\n      The trial court also declared that “Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it\n\napplies to the term “production” is unconstitutional and invalid.” CR 197, 346. As\n\ndemonstrated infra in Issue IV, the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider\n\nAutohaus’s attempted declaratory judgment claim and that claim should be\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction. However, even if the trial court had jurisdiction\n\nto consider such claim, Autohaus’s challenges to the validity and constitutionality\n\nof the Rule fail on the merits.\n\n             1.     Autohaus’s challenge to the Rule’s validity\n\n      Autohaus argues that Rule 3.588(b)(7) is invalid because it includes the\n\nclarifying language “occurring during the manufacturing or construction process”\n\nin reference to “installation”—words which do not appear in the language of\n\nsection 171.1012(a)(2).\n\n      But, as discussed supra, the term “installation” as used in section\n\n171.1012(a)(2) is ambiguous, the Comptroller may adopt rules that reasonably\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fclarify the terms used in a statute, and an adopted rule does not contradict a statute\n\nby the mere addition of words not existing in the statute. See Zimmer US, Inc., 368\n\nS.W.3d at 586; Myers v. State, 169 S.W.3d 731, 735 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no\n\npet.). Governmental agencies have a “unique understanding” of the statutes they\n\nadminister, and a court will generally uphold an agency’s interpretation of a statute\n\nit is charged with enforcing so long as the construction is reasonable and does not\n\ncontradict the plain language of the statute. R.R. Comm’n of Tex. v. Texas Citizens\n\nfor a Safe Future & Clean Water, 336 S.W.3d 619, 625, 629 (Tex. 2011). The\n\ncourt “need not consider whether the Commission's construction is the only—or\n\nthe best—interpretation in order to warrant [the court’s] deference,” but only\n\nwhether the “agency’s interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering to\n\nbe reasonable and in accord with the statute's plain language.” Id. at 628. “It is\n\nprecisely when a statutory term is subject to multiple understandings that [a court]\n\nshould defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation” and thus where a “statutory\n\nscheme is subject to multiple interpretations, [a court] must uphold the enforcing\n\nagency’s construction if it is reasonable and in harmony with the statute.” Id. at\n\n628, 629.\n\n      In determining whether an agency’s interpretation is reasonable, a court\n\nbegins with the language in the statute itself. Id. at 628. In determining legislative\n\nintent, a court must consider the statute’s meaning in the context of the entire\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\fstatute, not merely review words, phrases, or clauses in isolation. Id.; Myers, 169\n\nS.W.3d at 733. Furthermore, courts should not construe a provision in a manner\n\ninconsistent or out of harmony with other provisions of the statute even though the\n\nprovision might be susceptible to such a construction standing alone. Myers, 169\n\nS.W.3d at 733–34. Words in a statute cannot be interpreted apart from their\n\ncontext, and in interpreting statutory terms, a court should consider the term’s\n\nmeaning in the context of the entire statute. TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co, 340\n\nS.W.3d at 441.\n\n      The existing ambiguity in section 171.1012 regarding the term “installation”\n\ncould be argued to allow businesses to deduct the costs of services to customers as\n\ncosts of goods sold, in contravention to the fundamental principles of section\n\n171.1012 prohibiting the inclusion of services as part of a cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction. Indeed, this is precisely what Autohaus is attempting to do—deduct its\n\ncosts for labor for maintenance and repair services on customer-owned\n\nautomobiles as costs of goods sold.\n\n      The Comptroller, anticipating such potential misapplications of the statute,\n\nadopted Rule 3.588(b)(7) to ensure that the Legislative intent of subsection\n\n171.1012(a)(3)(B)(ii), prohibiting the inclusion of services as costs of goods sold,\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\fwas carried out. 4 The Comptroller has upheld that interpretation in Comptroller\n\nDecision 108, 124, Comptroller Decision 108, 125, and Comptroller Decision 108,\n\n126, STAR Accession No. 201309781H, September 12, 2013 (holding that a\n\ntaxpayer may not deduct labor charges for repair services as costs of goods sold,\n\nbut may deduct labor related to producing body parts that it sells to end-use\n\ncustomers).\n\n       Although “services” is not defined in the Tax Code, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized that it “includes generally any act performed for the benefit\n\nof another under some arrangement or agreement whereby such act was to have\n\nbeen performed.” Kirby Lake Develop., Ltd. v. Clear Lake City Water Auth., 320\n\nS.W.3d 829, 839 (Tex. 2010) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) effectively precludes labor costs for installations performed “for the\n\nbenefit of another,” i.e., installation services, from being deducted as costs of\n\ngoods sold. This is in accordance with the legislative mandate that costs of\n\nproviding services may not be deducted as cost of goods sold and ensures that\n\n\n\n\n4\n This rule has been in effect as long as section 171.1012 itself. See 32 Tex. Reg. 10034, 10034–\n38 (2007); Act of May 2, 2006, 79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 13–16.\nThe Legislature, although amending section 171.1012 in other respects in the interim, has never\nenacted any amendment that would negate the Comptroller’s interpretation of installation for the\npurposes of production as being only installation occurring during the manufacturing or\nconstruction process.\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\finstallation labor costs are only included as costs of goods sold when they are not\n\nperformed as a service.\n\n      Additionally, including the clarifying phrase “during the manufacturing or\n\nconstruction process” to the term installation as used in the context of production,\n\nensures that the term installation will be interpreted in the same manner as the\n\nother actions included in “production”—construction, manufacture, development,\n\nmining, extraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth—all of which\n\ndescribe actions in which the producer is bringing forth a product that it owns for\n\nultimate sale, not an action performed as a service on behalf of another on property\n\nbelonging to another. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical, 340 S.W.3d at 441–42\n\n(discussing the principle of statutory construction known as noscitur a sociis, or “it\n\nis known by its associates” that directs that similar terms be interpreted in a\n\nsimilar manner and applying it to terms in a statute); Hilco Elec. Coop., 111\n\nS.W.3d at 81(“[W]hen words of a general nature are used in connection with the\n\ndesignation of particular objects or classes of persons or things, the meaning of the\n\ngeneral words will be restricted to the particular designation.”); Combs v. Chapel\n\nZenray, Inc., 357 S.W.3d 751, 758–60 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011, pet. denied)\n\n(discussing the interpretation of the words “attach” and “attaching” in the context\n\nof a tax statute and rejecting taxpayer’s “plain meaning” argument in favor of\n\nComptroller’s narrow construction). Thus Rule 3.588 does not conflict with section\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f171.1012(a)(2), but rather acts to ensure that the interpretation of “installation” is\n\nconsistent with the other provisions of section 171.1012, and is therefore a\n\nreasonable interpretation of section 171.1012 and a valid rule.\n\n        Autohaus also argues that Rule 3.588(b)(7) is invalid because it contends\n\nthat the Legislature, in section 171.1012(a)(2), intended for a taxable entity’s\n\ninstallation of an item onto or into another party’s personal property to constitute\n\nthe “production” of that item for sale. As discussed supra, this argument is without\n\nmerit because it relies on a misinterpretation of section 171.1012(a)(2) and (c)(1)\n\nthat ignores the distinction between acquiring and producing a good for sale, the\n\nprohibition against deducting the cost of providing services, and most critically, the\n\nLegislature’s requirement that in the context of the production of goods, the\n\nbusiness must own the property onto or into which materials are being installed in\n\norder    for   installation   to   constitute    production.   See   TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§171.1012(c)(2), (a)(3)(B)(ii), (i). Rule 3.588(b)(7) does not conflict with section\n\n171.1012 in this regard either, but rather serves to implement the Legislature’s\n\nintent by ensuring that only the labor costs of installing of materials into personal\n\nproperty owned by the business, and which is being produced for ultimate sale by\n\nthe business, can be deducted as costs of goods sold.\n\n        Because Rule 3.588(b)(7) is a reasonable interpretation of section 171.1012\n\nand does not contradict the language of the statute, it is valid and must be upheld\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fand accorded deference by this Court. Texas Citizens, 336 S.W.3d at 628. Under\n\nthe application of such Rule, Autohaus is not entitled to a refund of any franchise\n\ntaxes for labor costs on customer-owned automobiles and its Chapter 112 claim\n\nfails. Additionally, Autohaus’s challenge to the validity of the Rule is without\n\nmerit. Thus even if jurisdiction exists for a declaratory judgment regarding the\n\nRule’s validity, the trial court’s judgment on this claim must be reversed and\n\njudgment rendered for Appellants.\n\n            2.     Autohaus’s Constitutional Challenges to the Rule\n\n      In its order granting summary judgment, and in its final judgment, the trial\n\ncourt also declared Rule 3.588(b)(7), as it applied to the term “production,” to be\n\n“unconstitutional,” without specifying which constitutional provisions the Rule\n\nviolated. CR 197, 346. Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment contended that\n\nthe Comptroller’s disallowance of Autohaus’s cost-of-goods-sold deduction for its\n\nlabor costs in repairing customer-owned automobiles violates the Equal and\n\nUniform Taxation Clause of the Texas Constitution (Tex. Const. art. VIII, § 1(a)),\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Texas Constitution (Tex. Const. art. I, § 3), the\n\nEqual Protection Clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const. amend.\n\nXIV, § 1), and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution (U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XIV, § 1). CR47–50. As these were the only constitutional\n\nchallenges raised by Autohaus in its summary judgment motion, the trial court at\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fmost could only have found that the Rule violated one or more of those\n\nconstitutional provisions. See Stiles v. Resolution Trust Co., 867 S.W.2d 24, 26\n\n(Tex. 1993)(holding that appellate court may not affirm summary judgment on\n\nground not asserted in summary judgment motion).\n\n      In reviewing taxation laws, courts indulge a strong presumption of\n\nconstitutional validity. Upjohn Co. v. Rylander, 38 S.W.3d 600, 609 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2000, pet. denied). The mandate under the Texas Constitution that all taxes\n\nbe equal and uniform “requires only that all persons falling within the same class\n\nbe taxed alike.” Id. Therefore, a litigant raising an equal and uniform taxation\n\nchallenge must show that the State’s classification at issue has no rational basis.\n\nTexas Entm’t Ass’n, Inc. v. Combs, 431 S.W.3d 790, 800 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2014, pet. denied), cert. denied sub nom, Texas Entm’t Ass’n Inc. v. Hegar, 135\n\nS.Ct. 1568 (2015). The requirements under Equal Protection Clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution and Equal and Uniform Taxation under the Texas Constitution\n\nare substantially the same and if a litigant’s Equal and Uniform Taxation challenge\n\nfails, so does any challenge based on the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S.\n\nConstitution or on the Equal Protection Clause of the Texas Constitution. Upjohn\n\nCo., 38 S.W.3d at 609; In re Nestle USA, Inc., 387 S.W.3d 610, 624 (Tex. 2012);\n\nCombs v. STP Nuclear Operating Co., 239 S.W.3d 264, 275 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2007, pet. denied)(holding that challenges under Texas’s Equal Protection Clause\n\n\n\n                                        33\n\fare evaluated using the same standard applied to challenges under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the U.S. Constitution).\n\n      Autohaus asserted that disallowance of its claimed deduction violated its\n\nequal and uniform tax and equal protection rights because it created an irrational\n\ntax classification, not related to the differences in doing business that affect the\n\nvalue of privilege of doing business, and caused Autohaus to pay significantly\n\nmore in franchise tax than other similarly situated taxpayers who produce tangible\n\nproperty for sale in the state. CR 8–9, 47–49. But Autohaus did not identify the\n\n“similarly situated taxpayers” it alleged were paying significantly less in franchise\n\ntax for performing services, nor did it present any evidence to support its\n\nconstitutional contentions. As discussed supra, the Comptroller’s interpretation of\n\nsection 171.1012, as applied in Rule 3.588(b)(7), implements the Legislature’s\n\nintent that businesses providing services cannot deduct service costs as costs of\n\ngoods sold and that deductions for the production of goods are limited to the\n\nowners of the good being produced for sale in the ordinary course of business. All\n\nof the taxable entities that are similarly situated to Autohaus and provide mixed\n\nservices by installing parts during the course of providing repair services on\n\nproperty belonging to their customers are treated equally and all such taxpayers are\n\nsubject to the requirements of Rule 3.588(b)(7) and the Comptroller’s\n\ninterpretation of section 171.1012.\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f      If Autohaus is attempting to argue that it is being treated differently from\n\ntaxpayers that install parts onto or into goods that such taxpayers own and produce\n\nfor sale, this comparison will not lie because these are not similarly situated\n\ntaxpayers. A taxpayer who owns a product and who installs materials onto or into\n\nthat product as part of finalizing production so that the product may be sold in the\n\nordinary course of business is clearly producing a product for sale as contemplated\n\nby section 171.1012 of the Tax Code and may therefore deduct its labor costs of\n\nproducing the product. As discussed supra, Autohaus is not producing a product\n\nproperty for sale when it installs a purchased automotive part into a customer’s\n\nautomobile during repair services, and so has no costs of production, but only costs\n\nof acquisition. The Legislature’s distinctions in section 171.1012 between those\n\nwho purchase goods for sale and so have acquisition costs and those who produce\n\ngoods and so have production costs, as well as its distinction between the sale of\n\ngoods and the sale of services, are rational distinctions that directly affect the value\n\nof the privilege. The Comptroller’s application of Rule 3.588(b)(7) implements the\n\npurposes of section 171.1012, groups similar things and differentiates dissimilar\n\nthings, and relates to differences in doing business that affect the value of the\n\nprivilege. Rule 3.588(b)(7) therefore does not violate either the Equal and Uniform\n\nTaxation Clause of Texas Constitution or the Equal Protection Clauses of either the\n\nU.S. Constitution of the Texas Constitution.\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f      Autohaus’s Due Process claim was based on its contention that “the\n\nComptroller’s disparate treatment requires Plaintiff to pay more in tax than other\n\ntaxpayers for the same right to do business enjoyed by other companies, which\n\nconstitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of Plaintiff’s property without due\n\nprocess of law.” CR 50. However, as in its arguments regarding equal and uniform\n\nprotection and equal protection, Autohaus did not identify what taxpayers would\n\npay less in taxes, much less establish this by any evidence, nor did it identify how\n\nit was being treated disparately or being deprived of property without due process\n\nof law. As noted supra, Rule 3.588(b)(7) is based on section 171.1012, which\n\nmakes rational distinctions between businesses which acquire goods for sale and\n\nthose who produce goods for sale, and between producers of goods and service\n\nproviders, and treats like-situated taxpayers similarly. Rule 3.588(b)(7) does not\n\nviolate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n      Thus Rule 3.588(b)(7) does not violate any of the constitutional provisions\n\ncomplained of by Autohaus. It should be upheld, accorded deference by this court,\n\nand applied to Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claims, which fail thereunder.\n\nAdditionally, because Autohaus’s constitutional challenges to the Rule are without\n\nmerit, even if jurisdiction exists for a declaratory judgment regarding the Rule’s\n\nconstitutionality, the trial court’s judgment on this claim must be reversed and\n\njudgment rendered for Appellants.\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\fIII.   EVEN IF A TAXABLE ENTITY MAY DEDUCT LABOR COSTS FOR INSTALLING\n       AUTOMOTIVE PARTS ONTO OR INTO CUSTOMER-OWNED AUTOMOBILES\n       DURING REPAIRS AS COSTS OF GOODS SOLD, MATERIAL ISSUES OF FACT\n       PRECLUDE THE GRANTING OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THE AWARD OF A\n       SPECIFIC REFUND AMOUNT ON AUTOHAUS’S CHAPTER 112 CLAIM.\n\n       Summary judgment is only proper when the evidence shows that there are\n\nno issues of material fact and that movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). It is the movant’s burden to establish that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nNixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., Inc., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985).               In\n\ndetermining whether a disputed material fact issue exists, a trial court is to take as\n\ntrue all evidence favorable to the non-movant and indulge every reasonable\n\ninference and resolve all doubts in favor of the non-movant. Id. at 548–49. In this\n\ncase, Autohaus failed to establish that it was entitled to summary judgment on the\n\namount of refund that it sought. A material fact issue exists as to the existence and\n\namount of the amount of both labor and material costs that were involved in the\n\ninstallation of automotive parts and thus the amount of any tax refund due.\n\n       Autohaus’s Controller’s affidavit, an exhibit to Autohaus’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, unambiguously recognizes that there was some “de minimus\n\namount” of labor costs that were not part of the costs of installing new or\n\nreplacement automotive parts. CR57. That affidavit affirmatively acknowledges\n\nthat part of the labor costs claimed in its costs-of-goods-sold deduction were not\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fdeductible. CR57. There was also a conflict between that affidavit, which implies\n\nthat costs of materials were disallowed, CR57, and that of the Comptroller’s\n\nauditor, Exhibit 1 to the Appellants’ cross-summary judgment motion, which\n\nstated that all costs of materials for which documentation was provided were\n\nallowed in the audit. CR128. Because material facts remains in dispute—the\n\nactual amount of deductible labor and the costs of materials which were disallowed\n\nand so subject to refund—summary judgment awarding the entire sum paid in\n\nprotest is precluded.\n\n      Moreover, the disallowed costs information provided by Autohaus on\n\nsummary judgment—described as (1) SRV CUST LBR MB, (2) SRV WARR\n\nLAB M/B, (3) SRV SUBLET RPR M/B, (4) CUST LBR-MECH L/T, and (5)\n\n4Y/50K MAINT MB with accompanying totals, see CR70—is insufficient to\n\nsupport the amount claimed by Autohaus as costs of goods sold as it does not\n\nspecify what costs are included in such figures (labor, materials, other deductible\n\ncosts, nondeductible costs?), nor does it segregate the labor costs involved in the\n\ninstallation of automotive parts from those labor costs that were not involved in the\n\ninstallation of automotive parts. Rather it simply lists all of the (unspecified) costs\n\nexpended by Autohaus for service, labor, or maintenance performed on all\n\ncustomer automobiles by Autohaus or one of its subcontractors during the time\n\nperiod. While some of the costs in Autohaus’s categories may be labor and\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fmaterial used in the installation of automobile parts, it is impossible to determine\n\nfrom the evidence presented on summary judgment what portion of the total costs\n\nin each category that is. Autohaus’s Controller’s affidavit likewise suggests that\n\nother costs are included in these broad categories as it refers to “all labor costs\n\nincluded” and “all material costs included,” in the Repair Costs and Subletting\n\nCosts, but does not specify what those amounts are nor does it state that the Repair\n\nCosts and Subletting Costs are exclusively comprised of labor and material costs.\n\nCR57.\n\n      Autohaus therefore, failed to produce evidence of a vital fact and precisely\n\nquantify those labor and material costs that actually qualified for the cost-of-goods-\n\nsold deduction under its own theory of the case. By failing to segregate labor and\n\nmaterial costs involving the installation of parts from labor or other costs that do\n\nnot, and instead simply presenting all of its costs for service, maintenance, and\n\nrepair of customer’s automobiles and seeking a refund for the same, Autohaus\n\nfailed in its burden to establish the proper amount of refund and a material issue\n\nremains regarding what amount, if any, is due and payable. See TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§§ 112.060(a)(refund is limited to portion of money paid under protest which was\n\nunlawfully demanded and belongs to taxpayer); 111.104(a)(refund is limited to an\n\namount of tax, penalty, or interest that has been unlawfully or erroneously\n\ncollected).   Further, conflicting evidence exists between the affidavits of the\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fComptroller’s auditor and Autohaus’s Controller regarding whether there were any\n\nremaining disallowed material costs, and Autohaus’s Controller admitted that not\n\nall of the disallowed labor costs involved the installation of materials. Thus even\n\nAutohaus’s evidence establishes that the amount sought, and awarded to Autohaus,\n\nas a refund for costs of goods sold and accompanying interest, $14,227.09,\n\nincludes some unspecified amount which was properly due and owning as tax, and\n\ntherefore is not subject to refund.\n\n      Taking as true all evidence favorable to the non-movant, and indulging\n\nevery reasonable inference and resolving all doubts in favor of the non-movant, see\n\nNixon, 690 S.W.2d at 548–49, a disputed material fact issue exists as to the amount\n\nof refund, if any, that is due. Where a disputed material fact issue exists as to the\n\nexistence or amount of a tax refund, summary judgment is precluded. See El Paso\n\nNatural Gas Co. v. Strayhorn, 208 S.W.3d 676, 686 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006,\n\nno pet.).\n\n      Autohaus failed to do more than raise a contested fact question as to the\n\namount of any refund due, as it provided no factual support for its contentions that\n\nall of the disallowed labor costs involved the installation of materials and that the\n\ncosts of any materials were disallowed, a claim contradicted by the Comptroller’s\n\nevidence. As a material fact exists, summary judgment for Autohaus on the amount\n\nof refund was not proper. Therefore, if this Court holds that Autohaus should\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fprevail on its Chapter 112 claim, the Court should reverse the trial court’s refund\n\naward on such claim and remand the case for a new trial on the proper amount of\n\nany refund.\n\nIV.   THE TRIAL COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION TO CONSIDER AUTOHAUS’S\n      ATTEMPTED CHALLENGE UNDER THE UNIFORM DECLARATORY\n      JUDGMENT ACT TO COMPTROLLER RULE 3.588(B)(7) OR ITS REQUEST FOR\n      ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COURT COSTS BECAUSE AUTOHAUS’S CLAIM DID\n      NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE UDJA AND WAS, APART FROM THE\n      ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COURT COSTS REQUEST, REDUNDANT OF ITS\n      CHAPTER 112 CLAIM.\n\n      The trial court’s summary judgment order and final judgment include a\n\ndeclaration that “Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n\n‘production’ is unconstitutional and invalid,” and granted Autohaus attorneys’ fees.\n\nCR197–98, 346–47. Neither specifies the legal basis for the declaratory judgment\n\nor award of attorneys’ fees or costs, however, the only basis under which\n\nAutohaus’s declaratory judgment and attorneys’ fees and costs were sought was\n\nthe UDJA. Autohaus claims that “[t]here is simply no other way to overturn an\n\ninvalid regulatory provision” than an action under the UDJA. CR379 –80.\n\n      But a challenge to the validity and constitutionality of an administrative rule\n\ndoes not fall within the scope of the UDJA. Nor is a challenge to the validity and\n\nconstitutionality of a rule an ultra vires claim. The trial court therefore had no\n\njurisdiction to grant declaratory relief, attorney’s fees, or court costs under the\n\nUDJA. Autohaus could have brought an action under section 2001.038 of the\n\n\n\n                                        41\n\fGovernment Code, which explicitly provides for a declaratory judgment challenge\n\nto an administrative rule. But Autohaus chose not to do so, precluding declaratory\n\nrelief on such basis. However, even if it had, the trial court would have had no\n\njurisdiction to award any attorneys’ fees or court costs. Finally, Autohaus’s\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims were, aside from a request for an award of attorneys’\n\nfees and court costs, redundant of its Chapter 112 claim, and so Autohaus was not\n\nentitled to declaratory relief under the UDJA or any award of attorneys’ fees or\n\ncourt costs.\n\n      The trial court’s ruling on Autohaus’s attempted declaratory judgment claim\n\nand its award of attorneys’ fees and court costs should be reversed, and the\n\nattempted declaratory judgment claim should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n      A.       A trial court may not grant a declaratory judgment regarding the\n               validity and constitutionality of a rule under the UDJA, and\n               therefore the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant a declaratory\n               judgment nor attorney’s fees or court costs under the UDJA in\n               this case.\n\n      This Court granted Autohaus’s requested declaratory relief, finding that\n\n“Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term ‘production’ is\n\nunconstitutional and invalid.”\n\n      However, the UDJA, by its very terms, does not provide for the grant of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment regarding the validity of rules. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 37.004(a). Section 37.004 relates exclusively to the construction or validity\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fof an “instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration\n\nof rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Id.; Texas State Bd. of Vet.\n\nMed. Examiners v. Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d 696, 708 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no\n\npet.). Further, to the extent that the UDJA applies to declaratory judgments against\n\nthe State of Texas, it is limited to proceedings involving the validity and\n\nconstitutionality of a “statute, ordinance, or franchise.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\n\nREM. CODE § 37.006.\n\n      Autohaus asserted below that because the trial court had to review and\n\ninterpret tax statutes, particularly section 171.1012(a)(2), in making its\n\ndetermination on the validity of Rule 3.588(b)(7), Autohaus’s action seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment on the validity of a rule is governed by section 37.004.\n\nHowever, the mere fact that a court must review and construe a statute in the\n\ncourse of making a legal ruling does not convert such an action into a declaratory\n\naction that falls under the UDJA. See Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708. Indeed, in\n\nruling on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim, the trial court was required to review and\n\nconstrue section 171.1012, but that did not convert Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim,\n\nfor which no attorney’s fees may be awarded, into a UDJA action for which\n\nattorney’s fees may be awarded. This Court has roundly rejected similar\n\narguments, calling such attempts the “very use of the UDJA—i.e., as a vehicle for\n\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fobtaining otherwise impermissible attorney’s fees—that the Texas Supreme Court\n\nsquarely held impermissible[.]” Id.\n\n      Even assuming arguendo that Autohaus’s interpretation of section 37.004 is\n\ncorrect and that any action in which a court must construe a statute falls within the\n\nscope of the UDJA, the Legislature has not waived sovereign immunity for all\n\nactions against the State that might fall within the scope of section 37.004. Rather,\n\nas against the State, the language of section 37.004 is further limited by that of\n\nsection 37.006, which provides:\n\n      In any proceeding that involves the validity of a municipal ordinance\n      or franchise, the municipality must be made a party and is entitled to\n      be heard, and if the statute, ordinance, or franchise is alleged to be\n      unconstitutional, the attorney general of the state must also be served\n      with a copy of the proceeding and is entitled to be heard.\n\n      TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 37.006(b).            The Supreme Court has\n\nexplained that section 37.006 waives sovereign immunity for challenges to the\n\nvalidity of an ordinance or statute. See Texas Dep’t of Trans. v. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d\n\n618, 622 (Tex. 2011); City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 373 n.6 (Tex.\n\n2009). Autohaus did not challenge the validity of any statute or ordinance in this\n\ncase, but rather argued that it is entitled to relief under the UDJA because “the\n\nCourt determined a question of construction related to Texas Tax Code\n\n171.1012(a)(2), which involves the associated Comptroller rule 3.588(b)(7).”\n\nCR231–32. This contention is incorrect. Autohaus did not seek a declaration on the\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\fconstruction of a statute, and the trial court did not grant a declaration on the\n\nconstruction of a statute, but even if it had, the UDJA does not waive immunity for\n\nactions against the governmental entities which seek only the interpretation or\n\nconstruction of statutes or ordinances and do not challenge the validity of the\n\nstatute or ordinance at issue. City of McKinney v. Hank’s Rest. Grp., L.P., 412\n\nS.W.3d 102, 111–12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.).5\n\n       Thus even if Autohaus’s action seeking a declaration on the validity of a rule\n\ncould be recharacterized, as Autohaus asserted, as an action seeking a declaration\n\non the construction of a statute, and even if the trial court’s ruling on the validity\n\nand constitutionality of a rule could be recharacterized as a declaratory ruling on\n\nthe construction of a statute, Autohaus would not be entitled to any declaratory\n\njudgment regarding the construction of any statute under the UDJA, nor any\n\nattorney’s fees or costs for such an action, because there is no waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity under the UDJA for an action seeking a declaratory judgment on the\n\nconstruction of a statute nor for any attorney’s fees or costs for such an action. See\n\n\n\n\n5\n  City of McKinney v. Hank’s Restaurant Group, L.P. involved a municipality so governmental\nimmunity, not sovereign immunity was involved, but as is clear from the Court’s discussion,\nthere is no difference in the analysis as applied to either sovereign or governmental immunity.\nSee City of McKinney v. Hank’s Rest. Grp., L.P., 412 S.W.3d 102, 111–12 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n2013, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                              45\n\fTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 37.006(b); City of McKinney, 412 S.W.3d at 111\n\n–12; Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708–09.\n\n      Sovereign immunity is waived under Texas Government Code section\n\n2001.038(a) for actions seeking a declaratory judgment on the validity of a rule.\n\nTEX. GOV’T CODE § 2001.038(a). Sovereign immunity is not waived under the\n\nUDJA for actions seeking a declaratory judgment on the validity of a rule or for\n\nactions seeking a declaratory judgment on the construction, rather than the validity,\n\nof a statute. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 37.004(a), 37.006(b); City of\n\nMcKinney, 412 S.W.3d at 111–12; see also Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d at 622; Heinrich,\n\n284 S.W.3d at 373, n.6. Since Autohaus sought relief only under the UDJA,\n\nsovereign immunity was not waived for the declaration that the trial court granted\n\nregarding the validity and constitutionality of Rule 3.588(b)(7).\n\n      It follows then that if the trial court had no jurisdiction to render a\n\ndeclaratory judgment regarding the validity or constitutionality of Rule 3.588(b)(7)\n\nunder the UDJA, it likewise had no jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees under\n\nsection 37.009. See Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708–09; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 37.009. Therefore the portion of the trial court’s judgment declaring Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) invalid and unconstitutional and awarding attorneys’ fees and court\n\ncosts should be reversed and Autohaus’s claims seeking declaratory judgment and\n\nattorneys’ fees and court costs should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      B.     Autohaus did not raise a claim within the ultra vires exception.\n\n      The trial court likewise had no jurisdiction over Autohaus’s declaratory\n\njudgment claim under the ultra vires exception and its final judgment did not\n\nrender a declaratory judgment on any ultra vires action. A declaratory judgment\n\nthat a rule is invalid is not a declaratory judgment that a particular state officer has\n\n“acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.” See\n\ndiscussion of ultra vires actions in Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372. It is simply a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that a rule is invalid. The Legislature has provided a specific\n\ncause of action and waiver of sovereign immunity for a party that seeks to overturn\n\nan administrative rule—an action under Texas Government Code section\n\n2001.038. Autohaus simply chose not to bring such an action.\n\n      Furthermore, to the extent that Autohaus asserts that it was actually raising\n\nan ultra vires complaint that the Comptroller acted without legal authority or failed\n\nto perform a purely ministerial act, Autohaus provided no arguments, evidence, or\n\nauthorities in the summary judgment proceedings to support such a complaint, but\n\nrather asserted that that (1) the Rule is invalid and unconstitutional (which does not\n\nraise a complaint about any particular action by any particular state actor); and (2)\n\nthe Comptroller unconstitutionally disallowed its deduction and assessed additional\n\ntax liability against it. But any complaints regarding the Comptroller’s\n\ndisallowance of Autohaus’s deduction and assessment of additional tax liability\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fwould be wholly redundant of Autohaus’s complaints under its Chapter 112 claims\n\nand thus declaratory judgment on such complaints would not have been proper. See\n\nGiggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 707–09; and discussion infra in Section IV.D.\n\nFurthermore, the Texas Supreme Court recently clarified that a complaint that\n\nchallenges a rule does not fall within the ultra vires exception. See Patel v. Texas\n\nDep’t of Licensing & Regulation, 469 S.W.3d 69, 76–77 (Tex. 2015).\n\n      C.     While Texas Government Code section 2001.038 provides courts\n             with jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgments regarding the\n             validity of a rule, such provision does not provide for the award of\n             attorneys’ fees or court costs. Thus even if Autohaus had raised\n             such a claim, and the trial court had jurisdiction under section\n             2001.038 to grant a declaratory judgment on Rule 3.588(b)(7), it\n             had no jurisdiction to award attorneys’ fees or court costs.\n\n      Texas Government Code section 2001.038 explicitly provides courts with\n\njurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of an agency\n\nrule. TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2001.038 (providing that the “validity or applicability of\n\na rule . . . may be determined in an action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged\n\nthat the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or threatens to\n\ninterfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the plaintiff.”). Nevertheless,\n\nnone of Autohaus’s pleadings raised any request for a declaratory judgement under\n\nsection 2001.038, and Autohaus expressly disavowed seeking any declaratory\n\nrelief under section 2001.038, asserting that it only raised declaratory judgment\n\nclaims under the UDJA. CR232–33. Thus the trial court would have had no\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fjurisdiction to grant declaratory relief regarding the validity and constitutionality of\n\nRule 3.588(b)(7) under Government Code section 2001.038.\n\n      However, even if Autohaus had raised a claim challenging Rule 3.588(b)(7)\n\nunder section 2001.038, and such claim was not redundant of its Chapter 112\n\nclaims (see discussion infra), the claim would have been without merit for the\n\nreasons discussed supra in II.D. Furthermore, section 2001.038, “unlike the UDJA,\n\ndoes not authorize attorney’s fees.” Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708; see TEX.\n\nGOV’T CODE § 2001.038; see also discussion in City of San Antonio v. Shavano\n\nRanch, No. 04-13-00623-CV, 2014 WL 631484, at *4–5 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\nFeb. 19, 2014, pet. denied)(mem. op.)(holding that even if a statute expressly\n\nprovides for declaratory relief against State, a party bringing a declaratory\n\njudgment claim under that statute may not recover attorneys’ fees under the\n\nUDJA). Thus, even assuming arguendo that Autohaus had pled a section 2001.038\n\nclaim, and such claim was not redundant of its Chapter 112 claims, the trial court\n\nwas not authorized to award attorneys’ fees or court costs.\n\n      D.     Autohaus may not recover attorneys’ fees or court costs for\n             redundant claims that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of\n             Chapter 112.\n\n      Additionally, the claims actually raised in Autohaus’s petition were\n\nredundant of its claims under Tax Code Chapter 112. Autohaus may not recover\n\nattorneys’ fees or court costs for declaratory actions which are inherently part of,\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fincidental to, or arise out of statutory claims for which the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees was not permitted. See Jackson v. State Office of Admin. Hearings, 351\n\nS.W.3d 290, 301 (Tex. 2011); MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P.,\n\n292 S.W.3d 660, 669–71 (Tex. 2009); and John G. and Marie Stella Kenedy\n\nMem’l Found. v. Dewhurst, 90 S.W.3d 268, 289 (Tex. 2002). Furthermore,\n\nChapter 112 “provides exclusive remedies for relief from assessed taxes on any\n\nbasis.” Sanadco, Inc. v. Office of Comptroller, No. 03-11-00462-CV, 2015 WL\n\n1478200, at *4 (Tex. App.—Austin March 25, 2015, pet. denied, motion for reh’g\n\nof pet. filed November 12, 2015)(emphasis in original).\n\n      The Legislature has waived sovereign immunity for Chapter 112 claims.\n\nAutohaus could and did raise its complaints about constitutional violations in its\n\nChapter 112 claim. Autohaus also raised a complaint under Chapter 112 regarding\n\nthe validity of Rule 3.588, and the trial court could rule on the validity of Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) as part of its determination of Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claims. CR 14\n\n(Autohaus’s protest letter raising grounds for Chapter 112 claims); TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 112.053(b) (limiting the issues to be determined in the suit to those arising from\n\nthe reasons expressed in the written protest as originally filed). The Legislature has\n\nalso provided a specific waiver of sovereign immunity for plaintiffs seeking to\n\nchallenge a regulatory provision that affects a plaintiff’s rights—Government Code\n\nsection 2001.038.\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f      But the Legislature did not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity for an\n\naward of attorney’s fees for claims under either Tax Code Chapter 112 or\n\nGovernment Code section 2001.038. To the extent that Autohaus has attempted to\n\nrecast its Chapter 112 claims and its rule challenge or Rule 3.588(b)(7) as\n\nchallenges under the UDJA, its efforts are no different than those by plaintiffs that\n\nwere condemned by this Court and the Texas Supreme Court for misuse of the\n\nUDJA. See Jackson, 351 S.W.3d at 301; MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 669–71;\n\nGiggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708; Strayhorn v. Raytheon E-Sys., Inc., 101 S.W.3d\n\n558, 571–73 (Tex. App.—Austin 2003, pet. denied).\n\n      Furthermore, this Court has also recently held that attempts to be relieved of\n\ntax liability and penalties fall under the exclusive remedies of Chapter 112, even\n\nwhen framed as declaratory judgment challenges to rules, statutes, or ultra vires\n\nactions. Sanadco, 2015 WL 1478200, at *5. This Court explained that Chapter 112\n\nprovided three statutorily-permitted suits—suit after payment in protest, suit for\n\ninjunction after paying or posting a bond, and a refund suit—and that aside from\n\nthese three avenues of relief, Chapter 112 “‘allows no actions to challenge or seek\n\nrefund of the taxes to which it applies,’ including declaratory judgment actions.”\n\nId., quoting In re Nestle USA, Inc., 359 S.W.3d 207, 209–10 (Tex. 2012); see also\n\nTEX. TAX CODE § 112.108. This Court concluded that actions under the UDJA\n\nwere preempted by Chapter 112. Id. at *4.\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f      Thus, to allow Autohaus to receive declaratory relief under the UDJA and\n\nrecover its attorneys’ fees and court costs in seeking a declaratory judgment\n\nregarding the validity and constitutionality of Rule 3.588(b)(7) in this case would\n\nnot only be without statutory authority, but would permit the Autohaus to “frustrate\n\nthe limits” that the Legislature intended by not permitting the recovery of\n\nattorneys’ fees or court costs for Chapter 112 claims and section 2001.038 claims,\n\nand allow Autohaus to do precisely what was expressly condemned by the Texas\n\nSupreme Court in MBM Financial, “to use the [UDJA] as a vehicle to recover\n\notherwise impermissible attorney’s fees.” MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 670,\n\n669. Moreover, it would conflict with the Texas Supreme Court’s and this Court’s\n\ndecision holding that the “only means by which a taxpayer may challenge the\n\n‘applicability, assessment, collection, or constitutionality’” of a state tax is through\n\na Chapter 112 action, not an action under the UDJA. Sanadco, 2015 WL 1478200,\n\nat *5 (emphasis in original), quoting Nestle, 359 S.W.3d at 209.\n\n      E.     Conclusion\n\n      This Court should therefore reverse the trial court’s judgment granting a\n\ndeclaratory judgment on Rule 3.588(b)(7) and its grant of attorneys’ fees and court\n\ncosts, and dismiss Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claims for want of jurisdiction.\n\nAlternatively, if this Court determines Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claim was\n\nnot redundant of its Chapter 112 claim, or otherwise preempted by Chapter 112,\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fand that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider Autohaus’s rule challenge under\n\nTexas Government Code section 2001.038, this Court should reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s declaratory judgment ruling for the reasons set out supra in II.D, and\n\nreverse its award of attorneys’ fees and court costs, dismissing Autohaus’s claim\n\nfor attorneys’ fees and court costs for want of jurisdiction.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, Appellants pray this Court to reverse the\n\njudgment of the trial court, dismiss Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claims for\n\nwant of jurisdiction, and render judgment against Autohaus on its Chapter 112\n\nclaim, or alternately remand for a new trial to determine the amount of any refund.\n\nIn the alternative, if this Court does not reverse the trial court’s judgment on\n\nAutohaus’s Chapter 112 claim, Appellants pray this Court to reverse the portion of\n\nthe judgment related to Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claims and dismiss\n\nAutohaus’s declaratory judgment claims for want of jurisdiction or, alternatively,\n\ndismiss Autohaus’s claims for attorneys’ fees and court costs for want of\n\njurisdiction and modify the judgment accordingly.\n\n                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 KEN PAXTON\n                                 Attorney General of Texas\n\n                                 CHARLES E.

The\n\nCourt also detennined that Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n\n\"production\" is unconstitutional and invalid. On that same date, the Court denied Defendant's\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment and Defendant's Plea to the Jurisdiction. Following the Court's\n\nOrder of July 22, 2014, Defendants filed their Motion for Reconsideration of Trial Court's\n\nRulings on Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment, and Defendants' Plea to the Jurisdiction, which was denied by the Court on October\n\n30, 2014.\n\n        On the 21st day of April, 2015, a trial was held before the Court to determine the amount\n\n\nFinal Judgment- Page I\n                                  Case # D-1-GN-13-000989\n\n                                  lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll\n                                  004006590\n                                                                                                                       344\n\f                                     DC              BK15125 PG48\n\n\n\n\nof attorneys' fees to be awarded, the amount of court costs, if any, to be awarded, and the\n\nstatutory basis for any award of interest on the refund of $14,227.09 in franchise tax paid in\n\nprotest. After receiving evidence and hearing arguments, the Court found that the following\n\namounts of attorneys' fees were reasonable and necessary in pursuing Plaintiff's claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief at trial or are reasonable and necessary to defend the grant of Plaintiff's claim\n\nfor declaratory relief on appeal:\n\n        (1)      $ 100,000 for amounts incurred through April19, 2015;\n\n        (2)      $ 1,600 for attorneys' fees associated with the trial on the amount of Plaintiff's\n                 award of Attorneys' Fees;\n\n        (3)      In the event Defendants file a Notice of Appeal and appeal this judgment to the\n                 Austin Court of Appeals and include an issue challenging the declaratory relief\n                 granted, $ 45,000 for responding to that issue and for oral argument on that issue\n                 if granted;\n\n        (4)      In the event that the Austin Court of Appeals denies relief on an issue challenging\n                 the declaratory relief granted and Defendants file a Petition for Rehearing or\n                 Petition for Rehearing En Bane with the Austin Court of Appeals seeking a\n                 rehearing or rehearing en bane on the appellate court's ruling on declaratory\n                 relief, $ 5,000 for responding to the pmtion of the Petition for Rehearing or\n                 Petition for Rehearing En Bane regarding the ruling on the challenge of the\n                 declaratory relief granted.\n\n        (5)      In the event Defendants file a Petition for Review with the Texas Supreme Court\n                 and raise an issue for review challenging the declaratory relief granted, $ 6,000\n                 for preparing and filing a Response to the issue raised in the Petition for Review\n                 challenging the declaratory relief granted.\n\n        (6)     In the event the Texas Supreme Court orders full briefing on an issue raised in the\n                Petition for Review challenging the declaratory relief granted, $ 18,000 to brief\n                such issue.\n\n        (7)     If the Texas Supreme Court requires oral argument on an issue raised in the\n                Petition for Review challenging the declaratory relief granted, $ 6,000 to prepare\n                and argue such issue.\n\n\n\nFinal Judgment-· Page 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       345\n\f                                        DC                BK15125 PG49\n\n\n\n\n         (8)     In the event Defendants file a Petition for Rehearing or Petition for Rehearing En\n                 Bane with the Texas Supreme Court seeking a rehearing or rehearing en bane on\n                 an issue raised for review challenging the declaratory relief granted, $ 6,000 for\n                 responding to such issue.\n\n        (9)      All appellate attorneys' fees awarded herein are expressly conditioned on Plaintiff\n                 prevailing on the respective appeal.\n\n        The Court further found that court costs in this case were $274.80 and awarded Plaintiff\n\nthat amount in court costs.\n\n        The Court further found that the proper statutory basis for any award of any interest on\n\nthe refund of$14,227.09 in franchise tax paid in protest, is Texas Tax Code§ 112.060 and Texas\n\nTax Code§ 112.058(a)(4).\n\n        Based on the Court's June 22, 2014 ruling on Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nits ruling on April 21, 2015, regarding reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, court costs, the\n\nproper statutory basis for any award of interest on the refund of $14,227.09 in franchise tax paid\n\nin protest, and the legal and equitable powers of the Court, Final Judgment is hereby rendered\n\nagainst Defendants, Glenn He gar, successor to Susan Combs, Comptroller of Public Accounts of\n\nthe State of Texas and Ken Paxton, successor to Greg Abbott, Attorney General of the State of\n\nTexas and in favor of Plaintiff Autohaus LP, LLP.\n\n        It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Plaintiff have and\n\nrecover from Defendants the following specific relief:\n\n        A.

In the months of April and May, 2012, I visited AUTOHAus•s offices in Plano.\nDuring the perfonnance of my audit, t worked directly with the taxpayer,s Principal and Chief\nFinancial Officer Mary Hutchison ~Ms. Hutchison') to determine taxpayer's compliance with\nTexas ftanchise tmrcodes for Report Year 2009.''\n\n        \"4.    I requested from M.s. Hutchison aU of the records necessary to conduct my audit\nSee attached document marked as •'Exhibit A.\" AUTOHAUS's 2009 franchise tax report was\nbased upon the taxpayer's business activities for the year ending December 31, 2008. (\"Tax\nPeriod''). See attached. document marked as \"Texas Franchise Tax Report, and \"Exhibit B.n\n\n        ••s. After confinning taxpayer's compliance on franchise tax report components like\ntotal revenue. apportionment factor, and tax rate, I focused. my efforts on the cost..of-goods-sold\ndeduction.\n\n\n                                             EXHIBIT 1\n\n                                                                                                      127\n\f       \"6.       Ms. Hutchison and I focused the audit investigation specifically upon the service\nlabor provided by AUTOHAUS to repair or install automobile parts upon custornerooOwned\nvehicles at the taxpayer's service department. Ms. Hutchison brought to my attention that some\nofthe repair was done by sub-contractors.\n\n        \"1.      The Comptroller auditor training r have taken during my employment has\nemphasized that the Texas Franchise Tax Code tax is based on a taxpayer~s business activities.\nThe costooOf~goocJs..sold deduction under Texas TIUC Code § 171.1012 is limited to costs incurred\nas a result of\"'acquiring or producing goods\" for sale. Based on my understanding from training,\nwhen a service departmen~ either directly or through a subcontractor, repairs an automobile or\ninstalls automobile parts and other tangible personal property on a customer~wned motor\nvehicle, it has perfonned a service activity under the Texas Tax Code and the labor for such\nrepair is not deductible as a cost of goods sold because the automobile is not then sold to the\ncustomer by the service department. However, the automobile partS and other tangible personal\nproperty used in that repair are eUgible to be included in a cost~f-goods--sold deduction because\nthe automobile parts and other tangible property used in the repair are sold to the customer (sale\nof acquired goods).\"\n\n        \"8.     ln my review of AUTOHAUS' business activities and·records for the Tax Period,\nI determined that auto repair perfonned by AUTOHAUS was considered mixed transactions as\ndefined under 34 Texas Administrative Code § 3.588(c) (1) by providing a service, repairs to\ncustomer-owned motor vehicles. and selling goods in the form of automobile parts and other\ntangible personal property to its customers under Texas Tax Code§ l7l.IOI2(a), Therefore. in\nmy audit, I allowed AUTOHAUS to include in its cost-of-goods-sold deduction all of the costs\nof acquiring and reselling the automobile parts and other tangible personal property that it and its\nsubcontractors had used during the tax periods including those used in the performance of its\nrepair and installation services, where AUTOHAUS provided supporting documentation.\"\n\n       \"9.     Further, I granted AUTOHAUS the oost..af•goods-.sold deduction fur both labor\nand automobile parts and other tangible personal property used where Ms. Hutchison was able to\nprovide documentation or other proofto show that the work was not performed as a semce, but\nwas rather performed as a production activity for work on a motor vehicle that AUTOHAUS\nowned prior to offering the motor vehicle for sale in the ordinary course ofits business.\"'\n\n        \"1 0. After I exhausted all of the documents and other material Ms. Hutchison\npresented to me to calculate and detennine the service labor expenses for work AUTOHAUS\nperformed on customer vehicles and included in its calculation of the cost..of-goods-sold\ndeduction for Report Year 2009, I finalized my tax adjustment summary and supporting exam as\nshown in exhibit C. No adjustments were made in any components other thPn cost of goods sold.\nThe results of my audit, as shown in Exam B and on the summary pages of my report, show that\nAUTOHAUS improperly included the service labor used to perform automotive repair and\ninstallation services upon motor vehicles belonging to its customers in its cast-of.-goods-sold\ndeduction for Report Vear 2009. See attached document matked as '•Summary Schedule'* and\n\"Exhibit C.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       128\n\f       ''11. Based upon tbe business records and facts generated during the audit, the\nComptroller provided AUTOHAUS With notification of audit results and assessed the taxpayer\nthe sum of$12,384.18 in taxes for Report Year2009.

This payment is remitted as full payment of the amount\nowed in accordance with the enclosed Texas Notification of Audit Results dated December\n5, 2012. Taxpayer makes this payment under protest. For the reasons that follow,\nTaxpayer maintains that the Texas Comptroller's assessment of franchise tax was\nincorrect. A Power of Attorney appointing David E. Colmenero as representative for\nTaxpayer is also enclosed.\n\n          Please file stamp the attached copy of this letter and check showing receipt of this\nletter.\n\n          Background\n\n        Taxpayer is an automotive dealership located in Plano, Texas. In its franchise tax\nreport for 2009, Taxpayer claimed a cost-of-goods-sold deduction. Taxpayer's cost-of-\ngoods-sold deduction included costs that it incurred in selling automobiles (\"Sales\nCosts\"), costs that it incurred in repairing automobiles (\"Repair Costs\"), and costs that it\nincurred in subletting such repair work to others (\"Subletting Costs\"). Only Taxpayer's\n\n\n\n\n                                             Ex. 3                                                                                            71\n\fRepair Costs and Subletting Costs are at issue here. Both Taxpayer's Repair Costs and\nTaxpayer's Subletting Costs included labor costs and costs of materials.\n\n        The Comptroller assessed a total amount due of $14,170.93, including state and\nlocal tax of $12,384.18 and interest of $1,786.75. This assessment was based on the\nComptroller's erroneous determination that Taxpayer could not include as cost of goods\nsold that portion of its Repair Costs attributable to labor and that Taxpayer could not\ninclude as cost of goods sold any of Taxpayer's Subletting Costs.                ·\n\n       Statement of Grounds for Protest\n\n       Taxpayer is entitled to include as cost of goods sold all of its Repair Costs,\nincluding labor costs, and all of its Subletting Costs, including labor costs and costs of\nmaterials. Alternatively, Taxpayer is entitled to include as cost of goods sold the costs of\nmaterials that were included in its Subletting Costs. Without limiting the generality of\nthe preceding statements; Taxpayer provides the following additional information:\n\n1) Under the Texas franchise tax, a taxpayer may elect to deduct the amount of its cost\n   of goods sold from its total revenue in order to calculate its taxable margin. See Tex.\n   Tax Code Ann.§ 171.101(a)(1)(B)(ii)(a).\n\n2) The cost-of-goods-sold deduction includes all direct costs of acquiring or producing\n   goods. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.1012(c). Labor costs and costs of materials are\n   specifically included as costs of goods sold. Id. § 171.1012(c)(l),(2),(3).\n\n3) \"Production\" for purposes of the cost-of-goods-sold deduction \"includes construction,\n   installation, manufacture, development, mining, extraction, improvement, creation,\n   raising, or growth.\" Tex. Tax Code Ann.§ 171.1012(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\n4) Because replacement of automotive parts necessarily involves the installation of\n   tangible personal property, labor costs associated with the replacement and/or\n   installation of automotive parts are cost of goods sold. See Tex. Tax Code §\n   171.1012(a)(2), (c)(1). Therefore, Taxpayer is entitled to include as costs of goods\n   sold the costs attributable to labor in both its Repair Costs and its Subletting Costs.\n\n5) The Comptroller's Rule 3.588(b)(7), which interprets the term \"installation\" that\n   qualifies as production to include only \"installation occurring during the\n   manufacturing or construction process\" does not properly reflect legislative intent and\n   is therefore invalid. See 34 Tex. Admin. Code sec. 3.588(b)(7).\n\n6) The Texas Comptroller has recognized in at least one other context that an\n   automotive repair service company is·in fact engaged in both selling and installing\n   automotive parts. See Comptroller Hearing No. 103,786 (May 10, 20ll)(\"Petitioner\n   provided automotive repair services such as the sale and installation of automotive\n   exhaust systems, transmissions, mufflers, brake linings, glass, and other items from\n   various outlets in Texas.\"). Indeed, this factual fmding has led the Comptroller to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               72\n\f   conclude that such entities may not qualify for the reduced .5% rate. See id\n   (\"Establishments primarily engaged in both selling and installing automotive parts are\n   considered to be engaged in services ....\").\n\n7) In addition, because replacement of automotive parts necessarily ·involves the\n   installation of tangible person property, costs of materials used in the replacement\n   and/or installation of automotive parts are also clearly costs of goods sold. See Tex.\n   Tax Code § 171.1012(a)(2), (c)(2), (3). Therefore, Taxpayer is entitled to include as\n   costs of goods sold all the costs of materials included in its Subletting Costs.\n\n8) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n   labor costs and costs of materials used in the production oftangible personal property\n   for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n   cost of goods sold, results in the disparate treatment of taxpayers within the same\n   class -i.e., businesses producing tangible personal property for sale to customers -in\n   violation of the \"equal and uniform taxation\" requirement of Section 1 of Article 8 of\n   the Texas Constitution. See Tex. Const. art. VIII,§ 1; In re Nestle USA, Inc., No. 12-\n   0518, 2012 WL 5073315, at *6 (Tex. Oct. 19, 2012). The Comptroller's unequal\n   application of the cost-of-goods-sold deduction is in violation of the \"equal and\n   uniform taxation\" requirement in the Texas Constitution because it is arbitrary and\n   not rationally related to any difference that affects the value of the privilege of doing\n   business within Texas. See Nestle, 2012 WL 5073315, at* 7; Bullockv. Sage Energy\n   Co., 728 S.W.2d 465,467-68 (Tex. App.-Austin 1987, writ refdn.r.e.).\n\n9) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n   labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n   for· sale, while allowing other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n   costs of goods sold, constitutes the imposition of unequal rights among taxpayers and\n   the granting of an exclusive separate privilege to certain taxpayers in violation of\n   Section 3 of Article 1 of the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const. art. 1, § 3.\n\n10) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all ~fits\n    labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n    for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n    cost of goods sold, constitutes a violation of Taxpayer's rights under the Equal\n    Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it arbitrarily results in Taxpayer\n    paying more tax than other similarly situated taxpayers. U.S. Canst. amend. XIV, §\n    1.\n\n11) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n    labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n    for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n    cost of goods sold, constitutes a violation of Taxpayer's rights under the Equal\n    Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because Comptroller's disparate treatment\n    of Taxpayer is based on a classification among taxpayers that is not supported by any\n    rational basis and is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               73\n\f12) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n    labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n    for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n    cost of goods sold, constitutes a violation of Taxpayer's rights under the Due Process\n    Clause of the U.S. Constitution because Comptroller's disparate treatment requires\n    Taxpayer to pay more tax for the same right to do business enjoyed by other\n    companies, which constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of Taxpayer's property\n    without due process oflaw.

Any costs excluded under Subsection (e) may not be subtracted under this\nsubsection.\n\n\n(g) A taxable entity that is allowed a subtraction by this section for a cost of goods sold and that is subject to Section 263A,\n460, or 471, Internal Revenue Code, may capitalize that cost in the same manner and to the same extent that the taxable entity\ncapitalized that cost on its federal income tax return or may expense those costs, except for costs excluded under Subsection\n(e), or in accordance with Subsections (c), (d), and (f). If the taxable entity elects to capitalize costs, it must capitalize each cost\nallowed under this section that it capitalized on its federal income tax return. If the taxable entity later elects to begin expensing\na cost that may be allowed under this section as a cost of goods sold, the entity may not deduct any cost in ending inventory\nfrom a previous report. If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold that may be allowed under this section, a\ncost incurred before the first day of the period on which the report is based may not be subtracted as a cost of goods sold.

This subsection does not affect\nthe type or category of cost of goods sold that may be subtracted under this section.\n\n\n(i) A taxable entity may make a subtraction under this section in relation to the cost of goods sold only if that entity owns the\ngoods. The determination of whether a taxable entity is an owner is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including the\nvarious benefits and burdens of ownership vested with the taxable entity. A taxable entity furnishing labor or materials to a\nproject for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance (as the term “maintenance” is defined\nin 34 T.A.C. Section 3.357) of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may include the costs,\nas allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of goods sold. Solely for purposes of this section, a taxable entity shall\nbe treated as the owner of goods being manufactured or produced by the entity under a contract with the federal government,\nincluding any subcontracts that support a contract with the federal government, notwithstanding that the Federal Acquisition\nRegulation may require that title or risk of loss with respect to those goods be transferred to the federal government before the\nmanufacture or production of those goods is complete.\n\n\n(j) A taxable entity may not make a subtraction under this section for cost of goods sold to the extent the cost of goods sold\nwas funded by partner contributions and deducted under Subsection (c)(13).\n\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution that offers loans to the public\nand elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity, other than an entity primarily engaged in an activity described by category\n5932 of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of Management and Budget, may\nsubtract as a cost of goods sold an amount equal to interest expense. For purposes of this subsection, an entity engaged in\nlending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production offers loans to the public.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Most of the taxes under the rule of Mexico came from land dues, tithes, excise duties, stamp tax and custom\n    duties. There were also taxes on income, on the export of coin and silver bullion, on the sale of the right of cock-pit\n    locations, on billiard tables, on capturing mustangs and wild cattle, and on the sale of tobacco. But the state treasury\n    was always in a “reduced” state, implying that the collection methods were probably far from adequate.\n\n    The distinctive features in the tax system of the Republic were the employment of specific duties, the fixing of a\n    minimum valuation of land, and the discrimination against the property of non-residents. Specific duties and minimum\n    valuations were designed to do away with undervaluation. Personal property--slaves, livestock, pleasure carriages,\n    watches, clocks, and land certificates--constituted the most valuable property of the Republic and contributed the\n    largest share of direct taxation. But the frontier counties, being harassed by both Indians and Mexicans resulting in\n    the continual loss or destruction of property, usually failed to pay taxes on personal property.\n\n    There was no provision in the constitution of the Republic enjoining equality and uniformity of taxation, and the result\n    was a mixed system of discriminating ad valorem and specific rates. When Texas became a state in 1845, the taxation\n    section of the constitution (Art. 7, §§ 27, 28) was for the most part patterned after the Louisiana constitution which had\n    been adopted early in 1845. It stipulated that taxation was to be equal and uniform, taxes to be assessed in proportion to\n    the value of the property except that two-thirds of both houses could agree to exempt certain property from taxation. It\n    permitted an income tax on occupations other than agricultural and mechanical pursuits, and exempted from taxation\n    $250 worth of household or other property belonging to each family. This exemption is not found in any other state\n    constitution of that time and is a Texas contribution to constitutional tax law.\n\n    The Constitutions of 1861 and 1866 repeated verbatim the provisos of the Constitution of 1845 (Art. 7, §§ 27, 28,\n    Const.1861; Const.1866), but the Constitution of 1869 dropped the $250 exemption for household furniture.\n\n    By the close of the Civil War a complex tax system had been developed consisting of property and poll taxes, salary\n    and occupation taxes. Under the Constitutions of 1866 and 1869, the property tax was the main source of revenue.\n    Business income and salary taxes were levied by the reconstruction government, but the results were poor, and a\n    gross receipts tax on railroads and telegraph companies and fixed taxes on insurance companies brought in meager\n    returns. General property taxes also fell off considerably for with the emancipation of slaves who had been assessed\n    for taxation at close of $140,000,000 taxable property to that amount was wiped out. The disfavor in which the\n    reconstruction government was held strongly disinclined taxpayers to pay for its support, and there was a vast amount\n    of property which escaped taxation through non-rendition, and in addition there was a great deal of delinquency in\n    the payment of taxes assessed.\n\n    The Constitution of 1876, unlike previous constitutions, limited the state tax on property, exclusive of the tax to pay\n    the public debt, to 50¢ on the $100 valuation of property (Art. 7, § 3). Occupational taxes, except on persons engaged\n    in agricultural and mechanical pursuits were again authorized; a state income tax was permitted; a head tax, called\n    poll tax, was authorized, and a tax of $1 for the benefit of the public schools was made a mandatory levy. In 1881 the\n    poll tax was $2, of which $1 went to the general revenue fund, and $1 to the school fund. In 1882, the general revenue\n    portion of the poll tax was reduced to 50¢ at which figure it has remained. In 1902, the constitutional requirement\n    of the payment of the poll tax as a pre-requisite to voting was adopted (Art. 6, § 2). The Constitution of 1876 also\n    reinstated the $250 exemption for household furniture which had been dropped by the Constitution of 1869.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Equality and uniformity; tax in proportion to value;..., TX CONST Art. 8, § 1\n\n\n\n\n    The legislature attempted various devices to collect delinquent and unrendered property taxes which had accumulated\n    under the reconstruction government, but the huge task of compiling the lists of such property proved to be so\n    cumbersome a task that eventually most of these taxes were waived.\n\n    Property taxes are almost as old as the institution of private property, and are usually the principal source of state\n    revenue; yet in 1946 and again in 1948, because of large surpluses in the treasury no property tax for general revenue\n    was levied in Texas, these being the only two instances of its non-levy in the history of the state.\n\n    A special characteristic of the Texas tax system is the earmarking of receipts to specific functions. The underlying\n    purpose of such earmarking is the desire to guarantee to a state function or service a certain basic amount of revenue,\n    and this accounts for the fact that there is often no logical connection between a particular tax and the fund for which\n    it is earmarked.\n\n    The taxes, all of the proceeds of which go to the general revenue fund, are the inheritance tax, the franchise, the\n    general revenue poll tax, and the domestic charter and foreign corporation permit fees.\n\n    Taxes which are shared one-fourth by the available school fund and three-fourths by the general revenue are the chain\n    store tax; gross receipt taxes on express, telegraph, car companies, pullman companies, and collection agencies; taxes\n    on awards and prizes; and the general occupation taxes.\n\n    Of the net receipts of the vending machine and admissions taxes, the available school fund receives one-fourth, and\n    the old age assistance fund receives the remaining three-fourths.\n\n    Of the net receipts of the motor fuel tax, the available school fund receives one-fourth, the county and district\n    indebtedness fund, one-fourth, and the highway department receives the remaining one-half.\n\n    The proceeds of the boxing and wrestling tax, the citrus fruit tax, the gas utility pipeline tax, and the tax on feed stuffs\n    go to enforcement funds though any unused balance is transferred to the general revenue fund.\n\n    The channeling of the other taxes is through the omnibus clearance fund which was set up in 1941. Into this fund go\n    the receipts from the gross receipts and production taxes on local public utilities, telephone companies, natural and\n    casing head gas, crude oil, carbon black, oil and gas well servicing, motor carriers, insurance companies, auto sales,\n    radio sales, cosmetic sales, and the receipts from taxes on cement distributors, stock share transfers, playing cards\n    and liquor, and cigarettes. Some of this fund is allocated to enforcement, one-fourth of the net after the deduction for\n    enforcement is allocated to the available school fund, and the remainder is divided among the state blind assistance,\n    state dependent children assistance, teachers' retirement, state old age assistance, farm-to-market roads, the foundation\n    school fund, and if anything remains, the general revenue fund.\n\n    The Texas constitution requires equal and uniform taxation. It is generally recognized that all taxpayers are not in\n    equal circumstances and that equal taxation of unequal circumstances would not be a valid application of the principle\n    of equal and uniform taxes. It is generally accepted that equity may be more nearly satisfied if taxpayers in similar\n    circumstances are treated equally. The United States Supreme Court has recognized this principle in its development\n    of the doctrine of reasonable classification. Decisions of that court have sanctioned any classification which has a\n    reasonable relation to some permitted end of governmental action. (See Alward v.

Equality of rights is a concept of republicanism, indigenous to America, finding\n    first expression in the Declaration of Independence. Section 3 of Article I sets forth two meanings of equality, that\n    of equal protection of the laws, and that of political equality.\n\n    Under the United States Constitution, the guaranty of equal protection of the laws was originally assumed by the\n    states, but upon addition of the fourteenth amendment of that constitution the duty was expressly imposed upon the\n    states in the following words: “nor [shall any State] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection\n    of the laws.” Broadly speaking equal protection of the laws means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall\n    be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. All free men have equal rights in the eyes of\n    the government. Justice Field has defined the principle well in the United States Supreme Court case of Barbier v.\n    Connolly, 5 S.Ct. 357, 113 U.S. 27, 28 L.Ed. 923 (1885). He declared: “that equal protection and security should be\n    given to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their personal and civil rights; that all persons should be\n    equally entitled to pursue their happiness and acquire and enjoy property; that they should have like access to the\n    courts of the country for the protection of their persons and property, the prevention and redress of wrongs and the\n    enforcement of contracts; that no impediment should be interposed to the pursuits of anyone except as applied to\n    the same pursuits by others under like circumstances; that no greater burden should be laid upon one than are laid\n    upon others in the same calling and conditions, and in the administration of criminal justice no different or higher\n    punishment should be imposed upon one than such as is prescribed to all for like offenses.”\n\n    Equal protection of the law does not prevent classifications in the law which subject some persons to a form of\n    regulation from which others are relieved or confers upon some an advantage denied others. However equal protection\n    does create a test for the classification and requires such to be reasonable, not arbitrary. The classification must be\n    based on reasonable grounds to promote the general peace, good order, morals or health of the community, between\n    classes substantially different from each other, and the classes established must include substantially all those who\n    stand in a similar position with respect to the law. Conversely, if the classification brings about unjust, unreasonable\n    or arbitrary discrimination it will be unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Equal rights, TX CONST Art. 1, § 3\n\n\n    The terminology of Section 3 declaring that “no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive separate public\n    emoluments, or privileges, but in consideration of public services” is said to declare the principle of equality in\n    political rights. The Supreme Court of Texas has asserted that this principle constitutes “...... a denial of all title to\n    individual privileges, honors, and distinctions from the community but for public services. It was directed against\n    superiority of personal and political rights, distinctions of rank, birth, or station, and all claims of emoluments from\n    the community by any man or set of men, over any other citizen of the State.” Glasgow v.

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United\nStates and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or\nimmunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n\nSection 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the\nwhole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of\nelectors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers\nof a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one\nyears of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the\nbasis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole\nnumber of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n\nSection 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any\noffice, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of\nCongress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of\nany State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or\ngiven aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n\nSection 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of\npensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States\nnor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States,\nor any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n\nSection 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\n     <Section 1 of this amendment is further displayed in separate documents according to subject matter,>\n\n     <see USCA Const Amend.

Autohaus’s Tax Report and Suit......................................................................7\n\n         A.        Autohaus’s 2009 Franchise Tax Report and the Comptroller’s\n                   Audit ......................................................................................................7\n\n         B.        Autohaus’s Protest Letter and Protest Payment ....................................8\n\n         C.        Autohaus’s suit ....................................................................................10\n\nSummary of Argument ............................................................................................14\n\nArgument..................................................................................................................15\n\nI.       Autohaus’s Installation of Automotive Parts onto or into Customer-\n         Owned Automobiles During Repair or Maintenance Work Is Not the\n         “Production” of Those Parts Under Section 171.1012, and Therefore\n         the Labor Costs for Such Installation May Not Be Deducted as Costs\n         of Goods Sold. ...............................................................................................15\n\n\n\n\n                                                              ii\n\fII.    Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) Is Both Valid and Constitutional. .................15\n\n       A.     Costs of goods sold under section 171.1012 include the cost of\n              acquiring or producing goods for sale, but excludes the cost of\n              providing services................................................................................16\n\n       B.     Section 171.1012 is ambiguous in regard to transactions\n              involving both services and sales and in its use of the word\n              “installation” because the labor involved in installation can take\n              place either in the context of the production of a good for sale\n              (deductible) or in the context of services performed for another\n              (not deductible). Rule 3.588 addresses this ambiguity. ......................17\n\n       C.     Autohaus does not “produce” purchased automotive parts when\n              it installs them onto or into customer-owned automobiles, but\n              rather it engages in a mixed transaction involving a sale of the\n              part and the provision of an automotive repair or maintenance\n              service. Autohaus may deduct as costs of goods sold its cost of\n              acquiring the automotive parts, but may not deduct labor costs\n              for “producing” the parts by installing them onto or into\n              customer-owned automobiles..............................................................20\n\n       D.     Autohaus’s claim also fails under the application of Rule\n              3.588(b)(7), and the Rule is both valid and constitutional ..................25\n\nIII.   Even If a Taxable Entity May Deduct Labor Costs for Installing\n       Automotive Parts onto or into Customer-Owned Automobiles During\n       Repairs as Costs of Goods Sold, Material Issues of Fact Preclude the\n       Granting of Summary Judgment and the Award of a Specific Refund\n       Amount on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 Claim. .................................................37\n\nIV.    The Trial Court Had No Jurisdiction to Consider Autohaus’s\n       Attempted Challenge Under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act to\n       Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) or Its Request for Attorneys’ Fees and\n       Court Costs Because Autohaus’s Claim Did Not Fall Within the\n       Scope of the UDJA and Was, Apart From The Attorneys’ Fees and\n       Court Costs Request, Redundant of Its Chapter 112 Claim. .........................41\n\n\n\n\n                                                     iii\n\f         A.        A trial court may not grant a declaratory judgment regarding the\n                   validity and constitutionality of a rule under the UDJA, and\n                   therefore the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant a\n                   declaratory judgment nor attorney’s fees or court costs under\n                   the UDJA in this case. .........................................................................42\n\n         B.        Autohaus did not raise a claim within the ultra vires exception.........47\n\n         C.        While Texas Government Code section 2001.038 provides\n                   courts with jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgments\n                   regarding the validity of a rule, such provision does not provide\n                   for the award of attorneys’ fees or court costs. Thus even if\n                   Autohaus had raised such a claim, and the trial court had\n                   jurisdiction under section 2001.038 to grant a declaratory\n                   judgment on Rule 3.588(b)(7), it had no jurisdiction to award\n                   attorneys’ fees or court costs. ..............................................................48\n\n         D.        Autohaus may not recover attorneys’ fees or court costs for\n                   redundant claims that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of\n                   Chapter 112. ........................................................................................49\n\n         E.

CR4. Autohaus filed a motion for summary judgment\n                and Appellants filed a response, cross-motion for summary\n                judgment, and plea to the jurisdiction. CR32–84, 93–177. On\n                July 22, 2014, the trial court issued an order granting\n                Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment and denying\n                Appellants’ motion for summary judgment and plea to the\n                jurisdiction. CR196–98. After a bench trial on the amount of\n                attorneys’ fees and court costs to be awarded, the trial court\n                signed a final judgment on April 29, 2015. CR344–49. A\n                motion for new trial was filed on May 29, 2015, and was\n                denied on July 9, 2015. CR350–64, 383. Notice of appeal was\n                filed on July 10, 2015. CR384–85.\n\nTrial Court’s   On April 29, 2015, the trial court entered a final judgment in\nDisposition:    favor of Autohaus, and ordered Appellants to issue a refund\n                of $14,227.09 of Texas franchise tax, plus statutory interest.\n                CR344–49. The trial court also declared that Comptroller\n                Rule 3.588(b)(7), as it applies to the term “production,” is\n                invalid and unconstitutional, and awarded attorneys’ fees and\n                court costs to Autohaus. CR346–48.\n\n\n\n\n                                        x\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      Section 171.1012 of the Tax Code permits a taxable entity to deduct as costs\n\nof goods sold its direct costs of acquiring or producing goods that it sells to\n\ncustomers. Taxable entities may deduct labor costs for producing goods for sale,\n\nincluding   installation   labor.   Comptroller     Rule   3.588(b)(7)    implements\n\nsection 171.1012 and clarifies that installation is production only if the installation\n\noccurs during the manufacturing or construction process.\n\n      This appeal decides whether a taxable entity that purchases goods for sale\n\nmay, in addition to deducting its costs of acquiring such goods for sale, also deduct\n\nlabor costs for “producing” those same goods if it installs those goods onto or into\n\npersonal property belonging to a customer. The appeal also involves an attempted\n\nchallenge to Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) under the Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act (TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 37.001, et. seq.)(“UDJA”), and\n\nthe award of attorneys’ fees thereunder. The specific issues in this appeal are:\n\n    1.       Autohaus’s installation of automotive parts onto or into customer-\n             owned automobiles during repair or maintenance work is not the\n             “production” of those parts under section 171.1012, and therefore the\n             labor costs for such installation may not be deducted as costs of goods\n             sold.\n\n    2.       Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) is both valid and constitutional.\n\n    3.       Even if a taxable entity may deduct labor costs for installing\n             automotive parts onto or into customer-owned automobiles during\n             repairs as costs of goods sold, material issues of fact preclude the\n\n\n\n                                          xi\n\f     granting of summary judgment and the award of a specific refund\n     amount on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim.\n\n4.   The trial court had no jurisdiction to consider Autohaus’s attempted\n     challenge under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act to\n     Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) or its request for attorneys’ fees and\n     court costs because Autohaus’s claim did not fall within the scope of\n     the UDJA and was, apart from the attorneys’ fees and court costs\n     request, redundant of its Chapter 112 claim.\n\n\n\n\n                               xii\n\f                                No. 03-15-00427-CV\n                      ______________________________________\n\n                            In the Court of Appeals\n                         for the Third Judicial District\n                                 Austin, Texas\n                 ________________________________________\n                GLENN HEGAR, COMPTROLLER OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS\n                          OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, AND\n             KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF TEXAS,\n                                             Appellants,\n\n                                             V.\n\n                             AUTOHAUS LP, LLP,\n                                            Appellees.\n                __________________________________________\n\n     On Appeal from the 419th Judicial District Court, Travis County, Texas\n             __________________________________________\n\n                                 APPELLANTS’ BRIEF\n                __________________________________________\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES OF THE THIRD COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Autohaus seeks to deduct, as costs of goods sold, its labor costs for\n\n“producing” purchased automotive parts when it installs those parts onto or into a\n\ncustomer’s automobile during repairs or maintenance. Autohaus’s claim fails\n\nbecause its installation of an automotive part onto or into a customer’s automobile\n\nis not the “production” of that part and is not a cost of Autohaus “acquiring or\n\nproducing”     that     part   for   sale.   Autohaus’s   challenge   to   Comptroller\n\nRule 3.588(b)(7) likewise fails because the rule properly and constitutionally\n\n\n                                             1\n\fimplements the Legislature’s intent that services not be deductible as costs of\n\ngoods sold and that a business may only deduct installation labor as costs of\n\nproducing a good for sale when materials are installed onto or into personal\n\nproperty that the business owns and is actually producing for sale.\n\n       Autohaus’s attempted declaratory judgment claim under the UDJA fails\n\nbecause it does not fall within the scope of the UDJA and, apart from an improper\n\nrequest for attorneys’ fees and court costs, it requests relief redundant of the issues\n\nin its Chapter 112 claim.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court should be reversed, the declaratory judgment\n\nportion dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and judgment rendered in favor of\n\nAppellants or, alternatively, the case remanded for a new trial.\n\n                                 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.     STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\n\n       The franchise tax imposes a tax on business entities in Texas for the\n\nprivilege of doing business in Texas. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.001(a). At the time at\n\nissue in this appeal, for business entities with more than $10,000,000 in total\n\nrevenue1 like Autohaus, the determination of the amount of franchise tax due first\n\n\n\n1\n   Businesses with less than $10,000,000 in revenue also had, and continue to have, the option of\nusing total revenue instead of margin as their tax base, but that provision is not relevant to this\nappeal. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1016.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\frequired the computation of the entity’s margin, which was the lesser of: (1) 70%\n\nof total revenue; (2) an amount computed by subtracting cost of goods sold from\n\ntotal revenue; or (3) an amount computed by subtracting compensation paid to\n\nemployees during the reporting period from total revenue. 2 Act of May 2, 2006,\n\n79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 8 (former TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.101(a)), current version at TEX. TAX CODE § 171.101(a)(1). While section\n\n171.101(a) was amended to allow for an alternative means to determine margin,\n\nthe subtraction of costs of goods sold from total revenue remains as an option for\n\ntaxpayers. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.101(a)(1)(B)(ii)(a)(1).\n\n       A.     Texas Tax Code Section 171.1012\n\n       The calculation of cost of goods sold is governed by Tax Code section\n\n171.1012, which permits a business to subtract certain of its costs to acquire or\n\nproduce the goods sold. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (b), (c). “Goods” are\n\nreal or tangible personal property sold in the ordinary course of business of a\n\ntaxable entity, but do not include any services. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1),\n\n(a)(3)(B)(ii). The entity must own the goods that it sells in order to make a\n\nsubtraction for cost of goods sold. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(i). Among the costs\n\n\n\n2\n  Once the margin is calculated, a percentage of that margin is then apportioned to Texas, and\nthat portion of the margin is subject to tax at the rate of 0.5% for qualifying retailers and\nwholesalers and 1.0% for all other taxable entities. TEX. TAX CODE §§ 171.106; 171.002(a), (b).\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat may be included as cost of goods sold are labor costs to acquire the goods or to\n\nproduce the goods. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(1). If an entity produced the\n\ngoods that it sold, it may include its cost of materials that are an integral part of the\n\nspecific property produced or which are consumed in the ordinary course of\n\nperforming production activities. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(2), (c)(3).\n\nProduction includes “construction, installation, manufacture, development, mining,\n\nextraction, improvement, creation, raising, or growth.” TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(2).\n\n      The language of these subsections remains unchanged from the time of their\n\ninitial enactment in January 1, 2008. Cf. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012 to Act of\n\nMay 2, 2006, 79th Leg., 3rd C.S., ch. 1, § 5, 2006 Tex. Gen. Laws 1, 13–16.\n\n      B.     Comptroller Rule 3.588\n\n      In September 2007, following the passage of the enacting legislation for\n\nSection 171.1012, the Comptroller proposed Rule 3.588 to implement section\n\n171.1012. See 32 Tex. Reg. 6288, 6288–92 (2007). The rule was adopted on\n\nDecember 28, 2007, and it went into effect on January 1, 2008, the same day as\n\nsection 171.1012. See 32 Tex. Reg. 10034, 10034–38 (2007).\n\n      Among the provisions of Rule 3.588 that are relevant to this appeal are the\n\nfollowing subsections, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      (b)    Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this\n             section, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly\n             indicates otherwise.\n\n             (3)   Goods—Real or tangible personal property sold in the\n                   ordinary course of business of a taxable entity.\n\n             (7)   Production—Construction, manufacture, installation\n                   occurring during the manufacturing or construction\n                   process, development, mining, extraction, improvement,\n                   creation, raising, or growth;\n\n             (10) Tangible personal property—\n                  (B) does not include:\n                        (ii) services.\n\n      (c)    General rules for determining costs of goods sold.\n\n             (7)   Mixed transactions. If a transaction contains elements of\n                   both a sale of tangible personal property and a service, a\n                   taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the\n                   costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to the\n                   tangible personal property sold;\n\n             (8)   Owner of goods. A taxable entity may make a subtraction\n                   under this section only if that entity owns the goods.\n\n34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.588(b)(3), (b)(7), (b)(10)(b)(ii), (c)(7), (c)(8). These\n\nsubsections have been in force and unchanged, apart from some renumbering,\n\nsince January 1, 2008. Cf. 32 Tex. Reg. at 10035–36 to 38 Tex. Reg. 3415, 3417–\n\n18 (2013). Also pertinent are subsections (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3), which were\n\namended in 2013 for clarity and to better conform with applicable federal law and\n\nsection 171.1012. See 38 Tex. Reg. at 3416, 3419. As originally enacted and in\n\neffect at the time of Autohaus’s claim, those subsections read:\n\n\n                                         5\n\f          (d)    Costs of goods sold. The cost of goods sold includes all direct costs of\n                 acquiring or producing the goods, including:\n\n                 (1)     labor costs including W-2 wages, IRS Form 1099 wages,\n                         temporary labor, payroll taxes and benefits;\n\n                 (2)     cost of materials that are an integral part of specific\n                         property produced; [and]\n\n                 (3)     cost of materials that are consumed in the course of\n                         performing production activities[.]\n\n32 Tex. Reg. at 10036–37 (2007) (current version at 34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n\n§ 3.588(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3)). 3\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Those sections currently read:\n\n(d) Direct costs. The cost of goods sold includes all direct costs of acquiring or producing the\n    goods. Direct costs include:\n\n          (1) Labor costs. A taxable entity may include in its costs of goods sold\n          calculation labor costs, other than service costs, that are properly allocable to the\n          acquisition or production of goods and are of the type subject to capitalization or\n          allocation under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.263A-1(e) or 1.460-5 as direct\n          labor costs, indirect labor costs, employee benefit expenses, or pension and other\n          related costs, without regard to whether the taxable entity is required to or actually\n          capitalizes such costs for federal income tax purposes;\n\n          (2) Incorporated materials. A taxable entity may include in its costs of goods sold\n          calculation the cost of materials that are an integral part of specific property\n          produced.\n\n          (3) Consumable materials. A taxable entity may include in its costs of goods sold\n          calculation the cost of materials that are consumed in the ordinary course of\n          performing production activities.\n\n34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.588(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fII.   AUTOHAUS’S TAX REPORT AND SUIT\n\n      A.    Autohaus’s 2009 Franchise Tax Report and the Comptroller’s\n            Audit\n\n      Autohaus is an automobile dealership. CR56. It both sells and repairs\n\nautomobiles, hiring subcontractors to do some of its repair work. CR56.\n\n      In 2009, Autohaus filed its franchise tax report for Report Year 2009\n\ncovering its business activities from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, and\n\napplied a cost-of-goods-sold deduction in the amount of $122,210,985 to calculate\n\na taxable margin in the amount of $17,334,147. CR59. Using such deduction,\n\nAutohaus reported that it owed franchise taxes in the amount of $86,564. CR60.\n\nAutohaus’s claimed cost-of-goods deduction included costs incurred in selling\n\nautomobiles (“Selling Costs”), costs of labor and materials to repair automobiles\n\n(“Repair Costs”), and costs of subcontracted labor and materials to repair\n\nautomobiles (“Subletting Costs”). CR57.\n\n      In the spring of 2012, the Comptroller conducted an audit of Autohaus’s\n\n2009 franchise tax report. CR127. Autohaus was requested to provide records\n\nnecessary to conduct the audit, including cost-of-goods-sold workpapers. CR127.\n\nDuring the conduct of the audit, it was determined that Autohaus was deducting\n\nlabor costs (both for its own employees and for its subcontractors) for maintenance\n\nand repairs on customer-owned automobiles as cost of goods sold. CR128. The\n\nComptroller disallowed those deductions, but allowed cost-of-goods-sold\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fdeductions for both labor and automobile parts when Autohaus provided\n\ndocumentation that the work was part of production activity on a car owned by\n\nAutohaus prior to offering it for sale in the ordinary course of business. CR128.\n\nThe Comptroller also allowed cost-of-goods-sold deductions for the cost of any\n\nautomobile parts used in any repair performed by Autohaus or its subcontractors\n\nwhen Autohaus provided supporting documentation. CR128.\n\n      On December 5, 2012, following the audit of Autohaus’s 2009 franchise tax\n\nreport, the Comptroller disallowed a portion of the claimed cost-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction, totaling $2,481,302, and adjusted the cost-of-goods-sold deduction to\n\n$119,729,683, resulting in additional franchise tax due by Autohaus of $12,384.18.\n\nCR68, 139–40, 142. The disallowed costs were in five categories labeled by\n\nAutohaus as follows: (1) SRV CUST LBR MB; (2) SRV WARR LAB M/B; (3)\n\nSRV SUBLET RPR M/B; (4) CUST LBR-MECH L/T; and (5) 4Y/50K MAINT\n\nMB. CR70, 140.\n\n      B.    Autohaus’s Protest Letter and Protest Payment\n\n      On January 14, 2013, Autohaus tendered to the Comptroller a protest\n\npayment of the additional franchise tax assessed and the interest due thereon, a\n\ntotal of $14,227.09, along with a written protest letter. CR148, 13–16, 71–76,\n\n153–58; see TEX. TAX CODE § 112.051 (requiring payment of taxes at issue due\n\nalong with written protest as a prerequisite for filing suit under Subchapter B of\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fChapter 112 of the Tax Code); TEX. TAX CODE § 112.052 (permitting the filing of\n\na suit against the state to recover taxes required to be paid to the state if the person\n\nhas first paid the tax at issue under protest); TEX. TAX CODE § 112.053(b) (limiting\n\nthe issues to be determined in the suit to those arising from the reasons expressed\n\nin the written protest as originally filed).\n\n      In its protest letter, Autohaus explained that its costs-of-goods-sold\n\ndeduction included costs incurred in selling automobiles (“Selling Costs”), in\n\nrepairing automobiles (“Repair Costs”), and in subletting such repair work to\n\nothers (“Subletting Costs”). CR13, 71, 153. Autohaus specified that the only\n\nmatters at issue were the disallowed costs-of-goods-sold deductions for Repair\n\nCosts and Subletting Costs incurred in repairing automobiles. CR14, 72, 154.\n\n      Under the “Statement of Grounds for Protest” section of its protest letter,\n\nAutohaus asserted generally that it was entitled to include as costs of goods sold:\n\n      (1)    “all of its Repair Costs, including labor costs, and all of its\n             Subletting Costs, including labor costs and costs of materials;”\n             or alternatively,\n\n      (2)    “the costs of materials that were included in its Subletting\n             Costs.”\n\nCR14, 72, 154. Autohaus also listed twelve additional specific assertions in the\n\nprotest letter under its “Statement of Grounds for Protest”, including that:\n\n            the Comptroller’s Rule 3.588(b)(7) “does not properly reflect\n             legislative intent and is therefore invalid” (No. 5);\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f           the Comptroller’s denial of “[Autohaus’s] right to include” the Repair\n            Costs and Subletting Costs at issue as costs of goods sold, “while\n            permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to includes such costs as\n            costs of goods sold”\n\n               o “results in the disparate treatment of taxpayers within the same\n                 class” in violation of the equal and uniform taxation\n                 requirement of “Section 1 of Article VIII of the Texas\n                 Constitution” (No.8);\n\n               o “constitutes the imposition of unequal rights among taxpayers\n                 and the granting of an exclusive separate privilege to certain\n                 taxpayers in violation of Section 3 of Article I of the Texas\n                 Constitution” (No.9);\n\n               o “constitutes a violation of [Autohaus’s] rights under the Equal\n                 Protection Clause of the United States Constitution” (Nos.10\n                 and 11); and\n\n               o “constitutes a violation of [Autohaus’s] rights under the Due\n                 Process Clause of the United States Constitution” (No.12).\n\nCR14–16, 72–74, 154–56. Autohaus tendered with its letter a protest payment of\n\n$14,227.09. CR17–18, 157–58.\n\n      C.    Autohaus’s suit\n\n      On March 22, 2013, Autohaus filed suit against Appellants “pursuant to\n\nChapters 112 and 171 of the Texas Tax Code,” and raised five claims:\n\n      •     “Plaintiff is Entitled to Include Labor Costs in its Cost of\n            Goods Sold Deduction;”\n\n      •     Plaintiff is Entitled to Include Subletting Costs in its Cost\n            of Goods Sold Deduction;”\n\n      •     “The Comptroller’s Assessment of Tax Violates\n            Plaintiff’s Rights Under the Texas Constitution;”\n\n\n                                         10\n\f•     “The Comptroller’s Assessment of Tax Violates\n      Plaintiff’s Rights Under the U.S. Constitution;” and\n\n•     “Plaintiff is Entitled to Declaratory Judgment and\n      Recovery of Attorney’s Fees under the Texas Uniform\n      Declaratory Judgment Act.”\n\nCR4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 151, 163, 165, 166, 168. As relief, Autohaus prayed for:\n\n(1)   a judgment for a refund of the $14,227.09 in taxes and interest that\n      were paid under protest;\n\n(2)   statutory interest on the same;\n\n(3)   costs of court;\n\n(4)   declarations under the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act\n      (“UDJA”) that:\n\n      (a)   “[Autohaus] is entitled to a refund of the $14,227.09 in\n            franchise tax and interest it paid under protest;”\n\n      (b)   “The Comptroller’s collection of tax is invalid because the\n            Comptroller has denied [Autohaus’s] rights to equal protection\n            and equal and uniform taxation;”\n\n      (c)   “The Comptroller’s collection of tax violates [Autohaus’s]\n            equal protection and due process rights under the United States’\n            Constitution and is therefore invalid;” and\n\n      (d)   “The Comptroller’s collection of tax violates the equal and\n            uniform taxation provision of the Texas Constitution and is\n            therefore invalid;”\n\n(5)   “Recovery of attorney’s fees as authorized by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n      Code § 37.009;”\n\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\falong with “[s]uch other relief as to which Plaintiff is justly entitled in law or\n\nequity.” CR11, 12, 168, 169.\n\n      Autohaus filed Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Incorporated\n\nBrief on May 23, 2014. CR32–84. Appellants filed Defendants’ Response to\n\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and Defendants’ Plea to the Jurisdiction on June 17, 2014. CR93–177.\n\nThe trial court heard both sets of motions on July 9, 2014, and on July 22, 2014\n\nissued orders granting Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment and denying\n\nAppellants’ cross-motion for summary judgment and plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nCR196–98.\n\n      In its order granting Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment, the trial\n\ncourt ordered that Autohaus was entitled to: (1) “include all of its labor costs\n\nassociated with Repair Costs and all of its labor costs and materials costs\n\nassociated with Subletting Costs involved in the installation of automotive parts in\n\nits cost of goods sold deduction;” (2) “a refund of the $14,227.09 in franchise tax\n\nthat it paid in protest;” (3) “[statutory] interest accruing on the amount of\n\n[Autohaus’s] refund claim;” and (4) “attorneys’ fees.” CR197–98. The trial court\n\nalso ruled that “Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n\n“production” is unconstitutional and invalid[.]” CR197. Appellants filed a motion\n\nfor reconsideration that was denied on October 30, 2014. CR260.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f      A bench trial was held on April 21, 2015 to determine the amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees and court costs to be awarded. CR344–45; 2RR5–7. Following the\n\nhearing, the trial court signed a “Proposed Final Judgment,” CR337–41, but later\n\nvacated it and issued a final judgment signed on April 29, 2015. CR344–49. The\n\nCourt’s final judgment, which incorporated its July 22, 2014 rulings, ordered that\n\nAutohaus recover from Appellants “the following specific relief:\n\n      A.    Plaintiff is entitled to include all of its labor costs associated with\n            Repair Costs and all of its labor costs and materials costs associated\n            with Subletting Costs involved in the installation of automotive parts\n            in its cost of goods sold deduction.\n\n      B.    Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n            ‘production’ is unconstitutional and invalid.\n\n      C.

Plaintiff is entitled to interest accruing on the amount of its refund\n            claim as provided under Texas Tax Code § 112.060 and Texas Tax\n            Code § 112.058(a)(4)[.]”\n\nCR346–47. The court also awarded Autohaus court costs in the amount of $274.80\n\nand “reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees incurred in pursuing its claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief” in certain specified amounts for trial and appeal. CR347.\n\n      Appellants filed a motion for new trial on May 29, 2015, which was denied,\n\nand notice of appeal was filed on July 10, 2015. CR 350–64, 383, 384–85.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f                           SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim fails because its labor costs for installing\n\npurchased automotive parts into or onto customers’ automobiles during repairs are\n\nnot costs of “acquiring or producing” the automotive parts. Autohaus purchases the\n\nparts for resale and so may deduct its costs of acquiring the parts; it does not\n\nproduce the parts and so cannot deduct production costs. Autohaus’s installation of\n\nthe parts is not production of the parts, but rather a mixed transaction involving a\n\nsale of goods (automotive parts), and the provision of services (repairs). For\n\ninstallation labor to be a production cost, an entity must be installing materials onto\n\nor into property that it owns and is producing for sale. Autohaus does not own the\n\ncustomer’s automobiles onto or into which the automotive parts are installed nor is\n\nit producing the customer’s automobiles for sale.\n\n      Autohaus’s challenge to Rule 3.588(b)(7) fails because the rule validly and\n\nconstitutionally implements the Legislature’s intent in Tax Code section 171.1012,\n\nand Autohaus provided no evidence supporting its constitutional challenges.\n\n      Autohaus’s attempted UDJA claim fails because a challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality or validity of an administrative rule does not fall within the scope\n\nof the UDJA, and Autohaus’s claim was redundant of, and preempted by, its\n\nChapter 112 claim.      The court had no jurisdiction to grant any declaratory\n\njudgment or award attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\nI.    AUTOHAUS’S INSTALLATION OF AUTOMOTIVE PARTS ONTO OR INTO\n      CUSTOMER-OWNED AUTOMOBILES DURING REPAIR OR MAINTENANCE\n      WORK IS NOT THE “PRODUCTION” OF THOSE PARTS UNDER SECTION\n      171.1012, AND THEREFORE THE LABOR COSTS FOR SUCH INSTALLATION\n      MAY NOT BE DEDUCTED AS COSTS OF GOODS SOLD.\nII.   COMPTROLLER RULE 3.588(b)(7) IS BOTH VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL.\n                                  (Argued Jointly)\n\n      In its Tax Code Chapter 112 claim for a refund of franchise taxes paid under\n\nprotest, Autohaus seeks to deduct labor costs for repair work performed on\n\ncustomer-owned automobiles as costs of goods sold when automotive parts are\n\ninstalled during the repair. Autohaus asserts that when repair work includes the\n\ninstallation of an automobile part, it is not a repair service to the customer, but the\n\nact of producing an automotive part for sale, and therefore both the actual cost of\n\nthe part and the labor costs of the repair are deductible as costs of producing the\n\nautomotive part.\n\n      But while Autohaus is correct that it may deduct its costs of acquiring the\n\nautomotive parts that it later sells as part of a repair to a customer-owned\n\nautomobile—i.e., its actual costs to purchase the part—it may not also deduct labor\n\ncosts for “producing” that same part when installing it onto or into a customer’s\n\nautomobile during those repairs. All of the labor costs that are at issue in this case\n\nwere incurred by Autohaus when providing a mechanic to perform the service of\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\frepairing customer’s automobiles. Autohaus does not “produce” the automotive\n\nparts that its mechanics install during repairs of customer’s vehicles; its only costs\n\nof “acquiring or producing” the parts for sale are its costs of purchasing those\n\nparts. It is therefore not entitled to deduct repair services labor as costs of goods\n\nsold.\n\n        Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) clarifies that only installation done as a part of\n\nmanufacturing or construction can be considered “production.” Contrary to\n\nAutohaus’s contentions, the Rule does not conflict with either Tax Code section\n\n171.1012 or the Texas or U.S. Constitutions.            Moreover, even without the\n\napplication of Rule 3.588(b)(7) to Autohaus’s claim, Autohaus’s Chapter 112\n\nclaim fails because Autohaus does not produce the automotive parts that it\n\npurchases for sale to its customers as part of its repair services.\n\n        A.    Costs of goods sold under section 171.1012 include the cost of\n              acquiring or producing goods for sale, but excludes the cost of\n              providing services.\n\n        At its most fundamental level, section 171.1012 creates certain threshold\n\nrequirements for the deduction of costs as costs of goods sold.\n\n        Firstly, a taxable entity must have sold “goods”—i.e., real or tangible\n\npersonal property, but not services—in the ordinary course of its business. TEX.\n\nTAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(3)(A), (a)(3)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f      Secondly, the taxable entity must have had costs of “acquiring or producing”\n\nthe goods that it sold, because it is the direct costs of the entity in acquiring or\n\nproducing these goods for sale that are deductible as costs of goods sold. TEX. TAX\n\nCODE § 171.1012(c).\n\n      The more detailed descriptions under section 171.1012 of what specific costs\n\nqualify to be deducted must be considered in light of these two threshold\n\nrequirements. Consistent with these threshold requirements, the Legislature\n\nrequires that the taxable entity be the actual owner of the “real or tangible personal\n\nproperty” that will be “sold in the ordinary course of business.” TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(3), (i). Thus, a taxable entity may not deduct as costs of\n\ngoods sold either the costs of performing services or the costs of acquiring or\n\nproducing goods that it does not own or that it does not sell. TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(3)(B)(ii), (i).\n\n      B.     Section 171.1012 is ambiguous in regard to transactions involving\n             both services and sales and in its use of the word “installation”\n             because the labor involved in installation can take place either in\n             the context of the production of a good for sale (deductible) or in\n             the context of services performed for another (not deductible).\n             Rule 3.588 addresses this ambiguity.\n\n      Section 171.1012(c) allows the deduction of all direct costs for “acquiring or\n\nproducing the goods” sold, including labor costs and “materials that are an integral\n\npart of specific property produced” or “materials that are consumed in the ordinary\n\ncourse of performing production activities.” TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(1), (2),\n\n\n                                         17\n\f(3). Section 171.1012(a)(2) defines “production” as including “construction,\n\ninstallation, manufacture, development, mining, extraction, improvement, creation,\n\nraising, or growth.” TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(2).\n\n      However, section 171.1012 does not detail how “mixed transactions” that\n\nmay involve both the sale of a good and the provision of a service—such as auto\n\nrepairs, hair styling, and medical care—are to be handled. Likewise, section\n\n171.1012 does not define the term “installation.” This creates a latent ambiguity as\n\npersonal property can be installed either onto or into property owned by another\n\nparty during the rendition of a service for that party (e.g., the installation of hair\n\nextensions onto a person’s hair during styling of a customer’s hair), or onto or into\n\nproperty owned by the business entity in the course of producing a good for sale by\n\nthat entity (e.g., installing hair, beads, or feathers onto a hair extension which will\n\nthen be sold to a customer). Both of these ambiguities in the administration of the\n\nstatute can be addressed by an administrative rule promulgated by the Comptroller.\n\nSee Zimmer US, Inc. v. Combs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (Tex. App.—Austin 2012, no\n\npet.)(holding that Comptroller may address ambiguity in administration of statute\n\nby administrative rule and noting that “[T]he legislature does not need to include\n\nevery specific detail or anticipate all unforeseen circumstances.”) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted); see also TEX. TAX CODE § 111.002(a) (providing\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fComptroller authority to adopt rules for enforcement of Tax Code provisions and\n\ncollection of taxes).\n\n      The Comptroller addressed both of these ambiguities in Rule 3.588,\n\nspecifically in subsections (c)(7)(“Mixed transactions”)—providing that if “a\n\ntransaction contains elements of both a sale of tangible personal property and a\n\nservice, a taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the costs otherwise\n\nallowed by this section in relation to the tangible personal property sold”—and in\n\n(b)(7), which specifies that installation in the context of production means\n\n“installation occurring during the manufacturing or construction process.” 34 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE § 3.588 (b)(7), (c)(7).\n\n      Subsections (b)(7) and (c)(7) of Rule 3.588 clarify that where there is a\n\nmixed transaction involving a service that includes the installation of a product\n\nowned by a business onto or into property owned by a customer, the installation\n\nlabor retains its character as a service to the customer and so is not deductible as a\n\ncost of goods sold; rather, only the cost of the actual product owned by the\n\nbusiness and sold to the customer is deductible as a cost of goods sold. See 34 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE § 3.588(b)(7), (c)(7). If, however, the business itself installs a\n\nproduct owned by the business onto or into property owned by the business for\n\npurposes of producing a good for sale in the ordinary course of business, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\finstallation labor in that case is part of the production of the good for sale and so\n\ndeductible as a cost of goods sold. See 34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 3.588 (b)(7).\n\n      C.     Autohaus does not “produce” purchased automotive parts when it\n             installs them onto or into customer-owned automobiles, but\n             rather it engages in a mixed transaction involving a sale of the\n             part and the provision of an automotive repair or maintenance\n             service. Autohaus may deduct as costs of goods sold its cost of\n             acquiring the automotive parts, but may not deduct labor costs\n             for “producing” the parts by installing them onto or into\n             customer-owned automobiles.\n\n      The Texas Legislature, recognizing that some businesses purchase goods for\n\nsale and others produce goods for sale, permits a taxable entity to deduct as costs\n\nof goods sold its direct costs of “acquiring or producing” the goods that it sells.\n\nTEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c). Autohaus purchases automotive parts for resale to\n\nits customers as part of repairs and so is entitled to deduct its direct costs of\n\nacquiring automotive parts that it sold. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c). The\n\nComptroller recognized this in its audit and allowed such deduction for any\n\namount that Autohaus established as purchase costs for automotive parts sold.\n\nCR128. The Comptroller has always maintained that Autohaus is entitled to a cost-\n\nof-goods-sold deduction for its costs of purchasing automotive parts that it sold in\n\nthe ordinary course of business, including parts sold as part of repair and\n\nmaintenance work, and it provided Autohaus an opportunity to present those costs\n\nduring the audit. CR128.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f      Autohaus, however, claims that it is entitled to deductions for both costs of\n\n“acquiring” the automotive parts (their purchase price), and costs of “producing”\n\nthose same purchased automotive parts. Autohaus theorizes that because section\n\n171.1012(a)(2) states that “‘Production’ includes . . . installation,” Autohaus’s act\n\nof installing the purchased automotive parts onto or into customer’s automobiles\n\nduring repairs is “producing” those parts for sale, and it may deduct its labor costs\n\nfor those repairs as costs of “production.” Autohaus misunderstands and misapplies\n\nsection 171.1012.\n\n      Firstly, section 171.1012(c) provides for the deduction of costs of “acquiring\n\nor producing” the goods that an entity sells—in other words, the cost to buy or the\n\ncost to make those goods. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(emphasis added).\n\nAutohaus does not make the automobile parts that it sells; it purchases them.\n\nCR57, 128. As discussed infra, the act of installing them onto or into a customer’s\n\nautomobile does not render Autohaus the “producer” of those purchased parts.\n\n      Secondly, section 171.1012(a)(2) does not state that every occasion of every\n\nact named therein is the production of a good for sale, nor is it reasonable to apply\n\nsuch a broad interpretation. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(2). Not every act of\n\n“improvement,” or “growth,” or “raising,” for example, is the production of a good\n\nfor sale. Rather, the subsection names acts that may be “include[d]” in the\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fproduction of goods for sale for those entities that make rather than buy goods for\n\nsale.

The scope of a\n\ngeneral word is therefore constrained by its statutory context. When a statute uses\n\n“words of a general nature” in connection with “particular objects or classes of\n\npersons or things, the meaning of the general words will be restricted to the\n\nparticular designation.” Hilco Elec.

Thus “installation,” as used in the context of\n\n“production” in section 171.1012, should not be construed as applying to\n\ninstallations that are not a part of actually producing a good for sale.\n\n       This is particularly significant in the case of installation. The distinction\n\nbetween installing personal property onto or into property owned by a customer, or\n\nonto or into property owned by the business, is critical in determining whether the\n\ninstallation labor is a service by the business, and so not deductible, or part of\n\nproduction costs for the business, and therefore deductible. Section 171.1012\n\nhighlights this distinction by specifying that a business may only “make a\n\nsubtraction under this section in relation to the cost of goods sold only if that entity\n\nowns the goods” which are sold. TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (i). Section\n\n171.1012 further makes clear that in the context of the production of goods, the\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fbusiness must own the property onto or into which materials are being installed in\n\norder for the installation to be “production” because, in order to be direct costs of\n\nproducing a good, materials must be “an integral part of specific property\n\nproduced.” TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(c)(2).\n\n      In the context of installation of parts onto or into an automobile, the item or\n\n“good” being “produced” by the “installation” of “materials” is the automobile—\n\nnot the automotive part which, in the context of “installation,” is the “material”\n\nbeing installed onto or into the “good.” Thus, in order to deduct the costs of\n\ninstalling automotive parts onto or into an automobile as costs of producing the\n\ngood (the automobile), Autohaus must own the automobile onto or into which the\n\nparts are being installed. See TEX. TAX CODE § 171.1012(a)(1), (a)(2), (c)(2), (i).\n\nHere Autohaus is seeking the deduction of labor for repairs only on customer-\n\nowned automobiles. Its installation of parts in that context is a service installation,\n\nwhich is not deductible under section 171.1012, and not a production cost for the\n\nproduction of an automobile that Autohaus owns and is preparing for sale.\n\n      Autohaus asserts that the good that it is “producing” is the automotive parts,\n\nbut its argument that it “produces” automotive parts by installing them is a\n\ntautology. Installed materials must be “an integral part of the specific property\n\nproduced” in order to be deductible as costs of “producing” a good. See TEX. TAX\n\nCODE § 171.1012(c)(2). Thus if the “goods” being produced are the automotive\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fparts, then the material “installed”—here, the automotive parts—must be an\n\nintegral part of the automotive parts being produced.            In other words, the\n\nautomotive parts must be installed onto or into themselves and be an integral part\n\nof themselves. Autohaus’s contention that it may “produce” a good by installing\n\nthat same good is an unreasonable construction of subsections 171.1012(a)(2) and\n\n(c)(1).\n\n          Rather, for Autohaus to be able to receive a deduction for “installation”\n\nrelative to the “production” of an automotive part, it must be installing some\n\nmaterial onto or into that automotive part which becomes an integral part of the\n\nautomotive part. For example, if Autohaus made a refurbished engine for the\n\npurpose of selling that engine to a customer, and in the course of making that\n\nengine it installed screws which became an integral part of that engine, Autohaus\n\ncould claim the costs of the screws as materials used in the production of the\n\nengine and could claim the costs of labor to make that engine, including the labor\n\nto install the screws.\n\n          But that is not the case here. Autohaus did not install anything onto or into\n\nthe automotive parts to “produce” them; it simply acquired them by purchase.\n\nAutohaus’s act of installing purchased automobile parts onto or into customers’\n\nautomobiles as part of repairs is not the “production” of the automotive parts, but\n\nrather simply a mixed transaction involving both the sale of a good (the automotive\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fpart) and the rendering of a service (the repair labor). Under the plain language of\n\nComptroller Rule 3.588(c)(7), which was not challenged in this case, if “a\n\ntransaction contains elements of both a sale of tangible personal property and a\n\nservice, a taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the costs otherwise\n\nallowed by this section in relation to the tangible personal property sold”—in this\n\ncase, its actual cost of purchasing the automotive parts. 34 TEX. ADMIN. CODE\n\n§ 3.588(c)(7).\n\n      Autohaus’s claim for a cost-of-goods-sold deduction for labor costs in\n\n“producing” automotive parts by installing them onto or into customer-owned\n\nautomobiles should be denied. The portion of the trial court’s judgment granting\n\nAutohaus’s Chapter 112 claim seeking a refund of franchise taxes paid in protest\n\nand all relief granted thereunder should be reversed and a take-nothing judgment\n\nentered in favor of Appellants.\n\n      D.     Autohaus’s claim also fails under the application of Rule\n             3.588(b)(7), and the Rule is both valid and constitutional\n\n      The above analysis demonstrates that Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim fails\n\neven without the application of Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) which Autohaus\n\nchallenges. Autohaus’s claim also fails when the language of Comptroller Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) is applied, as Autohaus’s installation of the automotive parts did not\n\noccur “during the manufacturing or construction process” of the automotive parts,\n\nbut during the course of repairs to customer’s automobiles.

Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) effectively precludes labor costs for installations performed “for the\n\nbenefit of another,” i.e., installation services, from being deducted as costs of\n\ngoods sold. This is in accordance with the legislative mandate that costs of\n\nproviding services may not be deducted as cost of goods sold and ensures that\n\n\n\n\n4\n This rule has been in effect as long as section 171.1012 itself.

As discussed supra, this argument is without\n\nmerit because it relies on a misinterpretation of section 171.1012(a)(2) and (c)(1)\n\nthat ignores the distinction between acquiring and producing a good for sale, the\n\nprohibition against deducting the cost of providing services, and most critically, the\n\nLegislature’s requirement that in the context of the production of goods, the\n\nbusiness must own the property onto or into which materials are being installed in\n\norder    for   installation   to   constitute    production.   See   TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§171.1012(c)(2), (a)(3)(B)(ii), (i). Rule 3.588(b)(7) does not conflict with section\n\n171.1012 in this regard either, but rather serves to implement the Legislature’s\n\nintent by ensuring that only the labor costs of installing of materials into personal\n\nproperty owned by the business, and which is being produced for ultimate sale by\n\nthe business, can be deducted as costs of goods sold.\n\n        Because Rule 3.588(b)(7) is a reasonable interpretation of section 171.1012\n\nand does not contradict the language of the statute, it is valid and must be upheld\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fand accorded deference by this Court.

Under\n\nthe application of such Rule, Autohaus is not entitled to a refund of any franchise\n\ntaxes for labor costs on customer-owned automobiles and its Chapter 112 claim\n\nfails. Additionally, Autohaus’s challenge to the validity of the Rule is without\n\nmerit. Thus even if jurisdiction exists for a declaratory judgment regarding the\n\nRule’s validity, the trial court’s judgment on this claim must be reversed and\n\njudgment rendered for Appellants.\n\n            2.     Autohaus’s Constitutional Challenges to the Rule\n\n      In its order granting summary judgment, and in its final judgment, the trial\n\ncourt also declared Rule 3.588(b)(7), as it applied to the term “production,” to be\n\n“unconstitutional,” without specifying which constitutional provisions the Rule\n\nviolated. CR 197, 346. Autohaus’s motion for summary judgment contended that\n\nthe Comptroller’s disallowance of Autohaus’s cost-of-goods-sold deduction for its\n\nlabor costs in repairing customer-owned automobiles violates the Equal and\n\nUniform Taxation Clause of the Texas Constitution (Tex.

But Autohaus did not identify the\n\n“similarly situated taxpayers” it alleged were paying significantly less in franchise\n\ntax for performing services, nor did it present any evidence to support its\n\nconstitutional contentions. As discussed supra, the Comptroller’s interpretation of\n\nsection 171.1012, as applied in Rule 3.588(b)(7), implements the Legislature’s\n\nintent that businesses providing services cannot deduct service costs as costs of\n\ngoods sold and that deductions for the production of goods are limited to the\n\nowners of the good being produced for sale in the ordinary course of business. All\n\nof the taxable entities that are similarly situated to Autohaus and provide mixed\n\nservices by installing parts during the course of providing repair services on\n\nproperty belonging to their customers are treated equally and all such taxpayers are\n\nsubject to the requirements of Rule 3.588(b)(7) and the Comptroller’s\n\ninterpretation of section 171.1012.\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f      If Autohaus is attempting to argue that it is being treated differently from\n\ntaxpayers that install parts onto or into goods that such taxpayers own and produce\n\nfor sale, this comparison will not lie because these are not similarly situated\n\ntaxpayers. A taxpayer who owns a product and who installs materials onto or into\n\nthat product as part of finalizing production so that the product may be sold in the\n\nordinary course of business is clearly producing a product for sale as contemplated\n\nby section 171.1012 of the Tax Code and may therefore deduct its labor costs of\n\nproducing the product. As discussed supra, Autohaus is not producing a product\n\nproperty for sale when it installs a purchased automotive part into a customer’s\n\nautomobile during repair services, and so has no costs of production, but only costs\n\nof acquisition. The Legislature’s distinctions in section 171.1012 between those\n\nwho purchase goods for sale and so have acquisition costs and those who produce\n\ngoods and so have production costs, as well as its distinction between the sale of\n\ngoods and the sale of services, are rational distinctions that directly affect the value\n\nof the privilege. The Comptroller’s application of Rule 3.588(b)(7) implements the\n\npurposes of section 171.1012, groups similar things and differentiates dissimilar\n\nthings, and relates to differences in doing business that affect the value of the\n\nprivilege. Rule 3.588(b)(7) therefore does not violate either the Equal and Uniform\n\nTaxation Clause of Texas Constitution or the Equal Protection Clauses of either the\n\nU.S. Constitution of the Texas Constitution.\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f      Autohaus’s Due Process claim was based on its contention that “the\n\nComptroller’s disparate treatment requires Plaintiff to pay more in tax than other\n\ntaxpayers for the same right to do business enjoyed by other companies, which\n\nconstitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of Plaintiff’s property without due\n\nprocess of law.” CR 50. However, as in its arguments regarding equal and uniform\n\nprotection and equal protection, Autohaus did not identify what taxpayers would\n\npay less in taxes, much less establish this by any evidence, nor did it identify how\n\nit was being treated disparately or being deprived of property without due process\n\nof law. As noted supra, Rule 3.588(b)(7) is based on section 171.1012, which\n\nmakes rational distinctions between businesses which acquire goods for sale and\n\nthose who produce goods for sale, and between producers of goods and service\n\nproviders, and treats like-situated taxpayers similarly. Rule 3.588(b)(7) does not\n\nviolate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n      Thus Rule 3.588(b)(7) does not violate any of the constitutional provisions\n\ncomplained of by Autohaus. It should be upheld, accorded deference by this court,\n\nand applied to Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claims, which fail thereunder.\n\nAdditionally, because Autohaus’s constitutional challenges to the Rule are without\n\nmerit, even if jurisdiction exists for a declaratory judgment regarding the Rule’s\n\nconstitutionality, the trial court’s judgment on this claim must be reversed and\n\njudgment rendered for Appellants.\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\fIII.   EVEN IF A TAXABLE ENTITY MAY DEDUCT LABOR COSTS FOR INSTALLING\n       AUTOMOTIVE PARTS ONTO OR INTO CUSTOMER-OWNED AUTOMOBILES\n       DURING REPAIRS AS COSTS OF GOODS SOLD, MATERIAL ISSUES OF FACT\n       PRECLUDE THE GRANTING OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THE AWARD OF A\n       SPECIFIC REFUND AMOUNT ON AUTOHAUS’S CHAPTER 112 CLAIM.\n\n       Summary judgment is only proper when the evidence shows that there are\n\nno issues of material fact and that movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). It is the movant’s burden to establish that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nNixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1782385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1782385/nixon-v-mr-property-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548 (Tex. 1985).               In\n\ndetermining whether a disputed material fact issue exists, a trial court is to take as\n\ntrue all evidence favorable to the non-movant and indulge every reasonable\n\ninference and resolve all doubts in favor of the non-movant. Id. at 548–49. In this\n\ncase, Autohaus failed to establish that it was entitled to summary judgment on the\n\namount of refund that it sought. A material fact issue exists as to the existence and\n\namount of the amount of both labor and material costs that were involved in the\n\ninstallation of automotive parts and thus the amount of any tax refund due.\n\n       Autohaus’s Controller’s affidavit, an exhibit to Autohaus’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, unambiguously recognizes that there was some “de minimus\n\namount” of labor costs that were not part of the costs of installing new or\n\nreplacement automotive parts. CR57. That affidavit affirmatively acknowledges\n\nthat part of the labor costs claimed in its costs-of-goods-sold deduction were not\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fdeductible. CR57. There was also a conflict between that affidavit, which implies\n\nthat costs of materials were disallowed, CR57, and that of the Comptroller’s\n\nauditor, Exhibit 1 to the Appellants’ cross-summary judgment motion, which\n\nstated that all costs of materials for which documentation was provided were\n\nallowed in the audit. CR128. Because material facts remains in dispute—the\n\nactual amount of deductible labor and the costs of materials which were disallowed\n\nand so subject to refund—summary judgment awarding the entire sum paid in\n\nprotest is precluded.\n\n      Moreover, the disallowed costs information provided by Autohaus on\n\nsummary judgment—described as (1) SRV CUST LBR MB, (2) SRV WARR\n\nLAB M/B, (3) SRV SUBLET RPR M/B, (4) CUST LBR-MECH L/T, and (5)\n\n4Y/50K MAINT MB with accompanying totals, see CR70—is insufficient to\n\nsupport the amount claimed by Autohaus as costs of goods sold as it does not\n\nspecify what costs are included in such figures (labor, materials, other deductible\n\ncosts, nondeductible costs?), nor does it segregate the labor costs involved in the\n\ninstallation of automotive parts from those labor costs that were not involved in the\n\ninstallation of automotive parts. Rather it simply lists all of the (unspecified) costs\n\nexpended by Autohaus for service, labor, or maintenance performed on all\n\ncustomer automobiles by Autohaus or one of its subcontractors during the time\n\nperiod. While some of the costs in Autohaus’s categories may be labor and\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fmaterial used in the installation of automobile parts, it is impossible to determine\n\nfrom the evidence presented on summary judgment what portion of the total costs\n\nin each category that is. Autohaus’s Controller’s affidavit likewise suggests that\n\nother costs are included in these broad categories as it refers to “all labor costs\n\nincluded” and “all material costs included,” in the Repair Costs and Subletting\n\nCosts, but does not specify what those amounts are nor does it state that the Repair\n\nCosts and Subletting Costs are exclusively comprised of labor and material costs.\n\nCR57.\n\n      Autohaus therefore, failed to produce evidence of a vital fact and precisely\n\nquantify those labor and material costs that actually qualified for the cost-of-goods-\n\nsold deduction under its own theory of the case. By failing to segregate labor and\n\nmaterial costs involving the installation of parts from labor or other costs that do\n\nnot, and instead simply presenting all of its costs for service, maintenance, and\n\nrepair of customer’s automobiles and seeking a refund for the same, Autohaus\n\nfailed in its burden to establish the proper amount of refund and a material issue\n\nremains regarding what amount, if any, is due and payable. See TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§§ 112.060(a)(refund is limited to portion of money paid under protest which was\n\nunlawfully demanded and belongs to taxpayer); 111.104(a)(refund is limited to an\n\namount of tax, penalty, or interest that has been unlawfully or erroneously\n\ncollected).   Further, conflicting evidence exists between the affidavits of the\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fComptroller’s auditor and Autohaus’s Controller regarding whether there were any\n\nremaining disallowed material costs, and Autohaus’s Controller admitted that not\n\nall of the disallowed labor costs involved the installation of materials. Thus even\n\nAutohaus’s evidence establishes that the amount sought, and awarded to Autohaus,\n\nas a refund for costs of goods sold and accompanying interest, $14,227.09,\n\nincludes some unspecified amount which was properly due and owning as tax, and\n\ntherefore is not subject to refund.\n\n      Taking as true all evidence favorable to the non-movant, and indulging\n\nevery reasonable inference and resolving all doubts in favor of the non-movant, see\n\nNixon, 690 S.W.2d at 548–49, a disputed material fact issue exists as to the amount\n\nof refund, if any, that is due. Where a disputed material fact issue exists as to the\n\nexistence or amount of a tax refund, summary judgment is precluded. See El Paso\n\nNatural Gas Co. v. Strayhorn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761962\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761962/el-paso-natural-gas-co-v-strayhorn/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 686 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006,\n\nno pet.).\n\n      Autohaus failed to do more than raise a contested fact question as to the\n\namount of any refund due, as it provided no factual support for its contentions that\n\nall of the disallowed labor costs involved the installation of materials and that the\n\ncosts of any materials were disallowed, a claim contradicted by the Comptroller’s\n\nevidence. As a material fact exists, summary judgment for Autohaus on the amount\n\nof refund was not proper. Therefore, if this Court holds that Autohaus should\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fprevail on its Chapter 112 claim, the Court should reverse the trial court’s refund\n\naward on such claim and remand the case for a new trial on the proper amount of\n\nany refund.\n\nIV.   THE TRIAL COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION TO CONSIDER AUTOHAUS’S\n      ATTEMPTED CHALLENGE UNDER THE UNIFORM DECLARATORY\n      JUDGMENT ACT TO COMPTROLLER RULE 3.588(B)(7) OR ITS REQUEST FOR\n      ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COURT COSTS BECAUSE AUTOHAUS’S CLAIM DID\n      NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE UDJA AND WAS, APART FROM THE\n      ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COURT COSTS REQUEST, REDUNDANT OF ITS\n      CHAPTER 112 CLAIM.\n\n      The trial court’s summary judgment order and final judgment include a\n\ndeclaration that “Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term\n\n‘production’ is unconstitutional and invalid,” and granted Autohaus attorneys’ fees.\n\nCR197–98, 346–47. Neither specifies the legal basis for the declaratory judgment\n\nor award of attorneys’ fees or costs, however, the only basis under which\n\nAutohaus’s declaratory judgment and attorneys’ fees and costs were sought was\n\nthe UDJA. Autohaus claims that “[t]here is simply no other way to overturn an\n\ninvalid regulatory provision” than an action under the UDJA. CR379 –80.\n\n      But a challenge to the validity and constitutionality of an administrative rule\n\ndoes not fall within the scope of the UDJA. Nor is a challenge to the validity and\n\nconstitutionality of a rule an ultra vires claim. The trial court therefore had no\n\njurisdiction to grant declaratory relief, attorney’s fees, or court costs under the\n\nUDJA. Autohaus could have brought an action under section 2001.038 of the\n\n\n\n                                        41\n\fGovernment Code, which explicitly provides for a declaratory judgment challenge\n\nto an administrative rule. But Autohaus chose not to do so, precluding declaratory\n\nrelief on such basis. However, even if it had, the trial court would have had no\n\njurisdiction to award any attorneys’ fees or court costs. Finally, Autohaus’s\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims were, aside from a request for an award of attorneys’\n\nfees and court costs, redundant of its Chapter 112 claim, and so Autohaus was not\n\nentitled to declaratory relief under the UDJA or any award of attorneys’ fees or\n\ncourt costs.\n\n      The trial court’s ruling on Autohaus’s attempted declaratory judgment claim\n\nand its award of attorneys’ fees and court costs should be reversed, and the\n\nattempted declaratory judgment claim should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n      A.       A trial court may not grant a declaratory judgment regarding the\n               validity and constitutionality of a rule under the UDJA, and\n               therefore the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant a declaratory\n               judgment nor attorney’s fees or court costs under the UDJA in\n               this case.\n\n      This Court granted Autohaus’s requested declaratory relief, finding that\n\n“Texas Comptroller Rule 3.588(b)(7) as it applies to the term ‘production’ is\n\nunconstitutional and invalid.”\n\n      However, the UDJA, by its very terms, does not provide for the grant of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment regarding the validity of rules. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 37.004(a). Section 37.004 relates exclusively to the construction or validity\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fof an “instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration\n\nof rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Id.; Texas State Bd. of Vet.\n\nMed. Examiners v. Giggleman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no\n\npet.). Further, to the extent that the UDJA applies to declaratory judgments against\n\nthe State of Texas, it is limited to proceedings involving the validity and\n\nconstitutionality of a “statute, ordinance, or franchise.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\n\nREM. CODE § 37.006.\n\n      Autohaus asserted below that because the trial court had to review and\n\ninterpret tax statutes, particularly section 171.1012(a)(2), in making its\n\ndetermination on the validity of Rule 3.588(b)(7), Autohaus’s action seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment on the validity of a rule is governed by section 37.004.\n\nHowever, the mere fact that a court must review and construe a statute in the\n\ncourse of making a legal ruling does not convert such an action into a declaratory\n\naction that falls under the UDJA. See Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708. Indeed, in\n\nruling on Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim, the trial court was required to review and\n\nconstrue section 171.1012, but that did not convert Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claim,\n\nfor which no attorney’s fees may be awarded, into a UDJA action for which\n\nattorney’s fees may be awarded. This Court has roundly rejected similar\n\narguments, calling such attempts the “very use of the UDJA—i.e., as a vehicle for\n\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fobtaining otherwise impermissible attorney’s fees—that the Texas Supreme Court\n\nsquarely held impermissible[.]” Id.\n\n      Even assuming arguendo that Autohaus’s interpretation of section 37.004 is\n\ncorrect and that any action in which a court must construe a statute falls within the\n\nscope of the UDJA, the Legislature has not waived sovereign immunity for all\n\nactions against the State that might fall within the scope of section 37.004. Rather,\n\nas against the State, the language of section 37.004 is further limited by that of\n\nsection 37.006, which provides:\n\n      In any proceeding that involves the validity of a municipal ordinance\n      or franchise, the municipality must be made a party and is entitled to\n      be heard, and if the statute, ordinance, or franchise is alleged to be\n      unconstitutional, the attorney general of the state must also be served\n      with a copy of the proceeding and is entitled to be heard.\n\n      TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 37.006(b).            The Supreme Court has\n\nexplained that section 37.006 waives sovereign immunity for challenges to the\n\nvalidity of an ordinance or statute. See Texas Dep’t of Trans. v. Sefzik, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (Tex. 2011); City of El Paso v.

Autohaus did not challenge the validity of any statute or ordinance in this\n\ncase, but rather argued that it is entitled to relief under the UDJA because “the\n\nCourt determined a question of construction related to Texas Tax Code\n\n171.1012(a)(2), which involves the associated Comptroller rule 3.588(b)(7).”\n\nCR231–32. This contention is incorrect. Autohaus did not seek a declaration on the\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\fconstruction of a statute, and the trial court did not grant a declaration on the\n\nconstruction of a statute, but even if it had, the UDJA does not waive immunity for\n\nactions against the governmental entities which seek only the interpretation or\n\nconstruction of statutes or ordinances and do not challenge the validity of the\n\nstatute or ordinance at issue.

Grp., L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111–12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.).5\n\n       Thus even if Autohaus’s action seeking a declaration on the validity of a rule\n\ncould be recharacterized, as Autohaus asserted, as an action seeking a declaration\n\non the construction of a statute, and even if the trial court’s ruling on the validity\n\nand constitutionality of a rule could be recharacterized as a declaratory ruling on\n\nthe construction of a statute, Autohaus would not be entitled to any declaratory\n\njudgment regarding the construction of any statute under the UDJA, nor any\n\nattorney’s fees or costs for such an action, because there is no waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity under the UDJA for an action seeking a declaratory judgment on the\n\nconstruction of a statute nor for any attorney’s fees or costs for such an action. See\n\n\n\n\n5\n  City of McKinney v. Hank’s Restaurant Group, L.P. involved a municipality so governmental\nimmunity, not sovereign immunity was involved, but as is clear from the Court’s discussion,\nthere is no difference in the analysis as applied to either sovereign or governmental immunity.\nSee City of McKinney v.

CODE § 37.006(b); City of McKinney, 412 S.W.3d at 111\n\n–12; Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708–09.\n\n      Sovereign immunity is waived under Texas Government Code section\n\n2001.038(a) for actions seeking a declaratory judgment on the validity of a rule.\n\nTEX. GOV’T CODE § 2001.038(a). Sovereign immunity is not waived under the\n\nUDJA for actions seeking a declaratory judgment on the validity of a rule or for\n\nactions seeking a declaratory judgment on the construction, rather than the validity,\n\nof a statute. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 37.004(a), 37.006(b); City of\n\nMcKinney, 412 S.W.3d at 111–12; see also Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d at 622; Heinrich,\n\n284 S.W.3d at 373, n.6. Since Autohaus sought relief only under the UDJA,\n\nsovereign immunity was not waived for the declaration that the trial court granted\n\nregarding the validity and constitutionality of Rule 3.588(b)(7).\n\n      It follows then that if the trial court had no jurisdiction to render a\n\ndeclaratory judgment regarding the validity or constitutionality of Rule 3.588(b)(7)\n\nunder the UDJA, it likewise had no jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees under\n\nsection 37.009. See Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708–09; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 37.009. Therefore the portion of the trial court’s judgment declaring Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) invalid and unconstitutional and awarding attorneys’ fees and court\n\ncosts should be reversed and Autohaus’s claims seeking declaratory judgment and\n\nattorneys’ fees and court costs should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      B.     Autohaus did not raise a claim within the ultra vires exception.\n\n      The trial court likewise had no jurisdiction over Autohaus’s declaratory\n\njudgment claim under the ultra vires exception and its final judgment did not\n\nrender a declaratory judgment on any ultra vires action. A declaratory judgment\n\nthat a rule is invalid is not a declaratory judgment that a particular state officer has\n\n“acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.” See\n\ndiscussion of ultra vires actions in Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372. It is simply a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that a rule is invalid. The Legislature has provided a specific\n\ncause of action and waiver of sovereign immunity for a party that seeks to overturn\n\nan administrative rule—an action under Texas Government Code section\n\n2001.038. Autohaus simply chose not to bring such an action.\n\n      Furthermore, to the extent that Autohaus asserts that it was actually raising\n\nan ultra vires complaint that the Comptroller acted without legal authority or failed\n\nto perform a purely ministerial act, Autohaus provided no arguments, evidence, or\n\nauthorities in the summary judgment proceedings to support such a complaint, but\n\nrather asserted that that (1) the Rule is invalid and unconstitutional (which does not\n\nraise a complaint about any particular action by any particular state actor); and (2)\n\nthe Comptroller unconstitutionally disallowed its deduction and assessed additional\n\ntax liability against it. But any complaints regarding the Comptroller’s\n\ndisallowance of Autohaus’s deduction and assessment of additional tax liability\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fwould be wholly redundant of Autohaus’s complaints under its Chapter 112 claims\n\nand thus declaratory judgment on such complaints would not have been proper. See\n\nGiggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 707–09; and discussion infra in Section IV.D.\n\nFurthermore, the Texas Supreme Court recently clarified that a complaint that\n\nchallenges a rule does not fall within the ultra vires exception. See Patel v. Texas\n\nDep’t of Licensing & Regulation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76–77 (Tex. 2015).\n\n      C.     While Texas Government Code section 2001.038 provides courts\n             with jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgments regarding the\n             validity of a rule, such provision does not provide for the award of\n             attorneys’ fees or court costs. Thus even if Autohaus had raised\n             such a claim, and the trial court had jurisdiction under section\n             2001.038 to grant a declaratory judgment on Rule 3.588(b)(7), it\n             had no jurisdiction to award attorneys’ fees or court costs.\n\n      Texas Government Code section 2001.038 explicitly provides courts with\n\njurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of an agency\n\nrule. TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2001.038 (providing that the “validity or applicability of\n\na rule . . . may be determined in an action for declaratory judgment if it is alleged\n\nthat the rule or its threatened application interferes with or impairs, or threatens to\n\ninterfere with or impair, a legal right or privilege of the plaintiff.”). Nevertheless,\n\nnone of Autohaus’s pleadings raised any request for a declaratory judgement under\n\nsection 2001.038, and Autohaus expressly disavowed seeking any declaratory\n\nrelief under section 2001.038, asserting that it only raised declaratory judgment\n\nclaims under the UDJA. CR232–33. Thus the trial court would have had no\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fjurisdiction to grant declaratory relief regarding the validity and constitutionality of\n\nRule 3.588(b)(7) under Government Code section 2001.038.\n\n      However, even if Autohaus had raised a claim challenging Rule 3.588(b)(7)\n\nunder section 2001.038, and such claim was not redundant of its Chapter 112\n\nclaims (see discussion infra), the claim would have been without merit for the\n\nreasons discussed supra in II.D. Furthermore, section 2001.038, “unlike the UDJA,\n\ndoes not authorize attorney’s fees.” Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 708; see TEX.\n\nGOV’T CODE § 2001.038; see also discussion in City of San Antonio v.

Autohaus also raised a complaint under Chapter 112 regarding\n\nthe validity of Rule 3.588, and the trial court could rule on the validity of Rule\n\n3.588(b)(7) as part of its determination of Autohaus’s Chapter 112 claims. CR 14\n\n(Autohaus’s protest letter raising grounds for Chapter 112 claims); TEX. TAX CODE\n\n§ 112.053(b) (limiting the issues to be determined in the suit to those arising from\n\nthe reasons expressed in the written protest as originally filed). The Legislature has\n\nalso provided a specific waiver of sovereign immunity for plaintiffs seeking to\n\nchallenge a regulatory provision that affects a plaintiff’s rights—Government Code\n\nsection 2001.038.\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f      But the Legislature did not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity for an\n\naward of attorney’s fees for claims under either Tax Code Chapter 112 or\n\nGovernment Code section 2001.038. To the extent that Autohaus has attempted to\n\nrecast its Chapter 112 claims and its rule challenge or Rule 3.588(b)(7) as\n\nchallenges under the UDJA, its efforts are no different than those by plaintiffs that\n\nwere condemned by this Court and the Texas Supreme Court for misuse of the\n\nUDJA.

This Court explained that Chapter 112\n\nprovided three statutorily-permitted suits—suit after payment in protest, suit for\n\ninjunction after paying or posting a bond, and a refund suit—and that aside from\n\nthese three avenues of relief, Chapter 112 “‘allows no actions to challenge or seek\n\nrefund of the taxes to which it applies,’ including declaratory judgment actions.”\n\nId., quoting In re Nestle USA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209–10 (Tex. 2012); see also\n\nTEX. TAX CODE § 112.108. This Court concluded that actions under the UDJA\n\nwere preempted by Chapter 112. Id. at *4.\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f      Thus, to allow Autohaus to receive declaratory relief under the UDJA and\n\nrecover its attorneys’ fees and court costs in seeking a declaratory judgment\n\nregarding the validity and constitutionality of Rule 3.588(b)(7) in this case would\n\nnot only be without statutory authority, but would permit the Autohaus to “frustrate\n\nthe limits” that the Legislature intended by not permitting the recovery of\n\nattorneys’ fees or court costs for Chapter 112 claims and section 2001.038 claims,\n\nand allow Autohaus to do precisely what was expressly condemned by the Texas\n\nSupreme Court in MBM Financial, “to use the [UDJA] as a vehicle to recover\n\notherwise impermissible attorney’s fees.” MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 670,\n\n669. Moreover, it would conflict with the Texas Supreme Court’s and this Court’s\n\ndecision holding that the “only means by which a taxpayer may challenge the\n\n‘applicability, assessment, collection, or constitutionality’” of a state tax is through\n\na Chapter 112 action, not an action under the UDJA.

Conclusion\n\n      This Court should therefore reverse the trial court’s judgment granting a\n\ndeclaratory judgment on Rule 3.588(b)(7) and its grant of attorneys’ fees and court\n\ncosts, and dismiss Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claims for want of jurisdiction.\n\nAlternatively, if this Court determines Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claim was\n\nnot redundant of its Chapter 112 claim, or otherwise preempted by Chapter 112,\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fand that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider Autohaus’s rule challenge under\n\nTexas Government Code section 2001.038, this Court should reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s declaratory judgment ruling for the reasons set out supra in II.D, and\n\nreverse its award of attorneys’ fees and court costs, dismissing Autohaus’s claim\n\nfor attorneys’ fees and court costs for want of jurisdiction.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, Appellants pray this Court to reverse the\n\njudgment of the trial court, dismiss Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claims for\n\nwant of jurisdiction, and render judgment against Autohaus on its Chapter 112\n\nclaim, or alternately remand for a new trial to determine the amount of any refund.\n\nIn the alternative, if this Court does not reverse the trial court’s judgment on\n\nAutohaus’s Chapter 112 claim, Appellants pray this Court to reverse the portion of\n\nthe judgment related to Autohaus’s declaratory judgment claims and dismiss\n\nAutohaus’s declaratory judgment claims for want of jurisdiction or, alternatively,\n\ndismiss Autohaus’s claims for attorneys’ fees and court costs for want of\n\njurisdiction and modify the judgment accordingly.\n\n                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 KEN PAXTON\n                                 Attorney General of Texas\n\n                                 CHARLES E.

Ms. Hutchison and I focused the audit investigation specifically upon the service\nlabor provided by AUTOHAUS to repair or install automobile parts upon custornerooOwned\nvehicles at the taxpayer's service department. Ms. Hutchison brought to my attention that some\nofthe repair was done by sub-contractors.\n\n        \"1.      The Comptroller auditor training r have taken during my employment has\nemphasized that the Texas Franchise Tax Code tax is based on a taxpayer~s business activities.\nThe costooOf~goocJs..sold deduction under Texas TIUC Code § 171.1012 is limited to costs incurred\nas a result of\"'acquiring or producing goods\" for sale. Based on my understanding from training,\nwhen a service departmen~ either directly or through a subcontractor, repairs an automobile or\ninstalls automobile parts and other tangible personal property on a customer~wned motor\nvehicle, it has perfonned a service activity under the Texas Tax Code and the labor for such\nrepair is not deductible as a cost of goods sold because the automobile is not then sold to the\ncustomer by the service department. However, the automobile partS and other tangible personal\nproperty used in that repair are eUgible to be included in a cost~f-goods--sold deduction because\nthe automobile parts and other tangible property used in the repair are sold to the customer (sale\nof acquired goods).\"\n\n        \"8.     ln my review of AUTOHAUS' business activities and·records for the Tax Period,\nI determined that auto repair perfonned by AUTOHAUS was considered mixed transactions as\ndefined under 34 Texas Administrative Code § 3.588(c) (1) by providing a service, repairs to\ncustomer-owned motor vehicles. and selling goods in the form of automobile parts and other\ntangible personal property to its customers under Texas Tax Code§ l7l.IOI2(a), Therefore. in\nmy audit, I allowed AUTOHAUS to include in its cost-of-goods-sold deduction all of the costs\nof acquiring and reselling the automobile parts and other tangible personal property that it and its\nsubcontractors had used during the tax periods including those used in the performance of its\nrepair and installation services, where AUTOHAUS provided supporting documentation.\"\n\n       \"9.     Further, I granted AUTOHAUS the oost..af•goods-.sold deduction fur both labor\nand automobile parts and other tangible personal property used where Ms. Hutchison was able to\nprovide documentation or other proofto show that the work was not performed as a semce, but\nwas rather performed as a production activity for work on a motor vehicle that AUTOHAUS\nowned prior to offering the motor vehicle for sale in the ordinary course ofits business.\"'\n\n        \"1 0. After I exhausted all of the documents and other material Ms. Hutchison\npresented to me to calculate and detennine the service labor expenses for work AUTOHAUS\nperformed on customer vehicles and included in its calculation of the cost..of-goods-sold\ndeduction for Report Year 2009, I finalized my tax adjustment summary and supporting exam as\nshown in exhibit C. No adjustments were made in any components other thPn cost of goods sold.\nThe results of my audit, as shown in Exam B and on the summary pages of my report, show that\nAUTOHAUS improperly included the service labor used to perform automotive repair and\ninstallation services upon motor vehicles belonging to its customers in its cast-of.-goods-sold\ndeduction for Report Vear 2009.

This payment is remitted as full payment of the amount\nowed in accordance with the enclosed Texas Notification of Audit Results dated December\n5, 2012. Taxpayer makes this payment under protest. For the reasons that follow,\nTaxpayer maintains that the Texas Comptroller's assessment of franchise tax was\nincorrect. A Power of Attorney appointing David E. Colmenero as representative for\nTaxpayer is also enclosed.\n\n          Please file stamp the attached copy of this letter and check showing receipt of this\nletter.\n\n          Background\n\n        Taxpayer is an automotive dealership located in Plano, Texas. In its franchise tax\nreport for 2009, Taxpayer claimed a cost-of-goods-sold deduction. Taxpayer's cost-of-\ngoods-sold deduction included costs that it incurred in selling automobiles (\"Sales\nCosts\"), costs that it incurred in repairing automobiles (\"Repair Costs\"), and costs that it\nincurred in subletting such repair work to others (\"Subletting Costs\"). Only Taxpayer's\n\n\n\n\n                                             Ex. 3                                                                                            71\n\fRepair Costs and Subletting Costs are at issue here. Both Taxpayer's Repair Costs and\nTaxpayer's Subletting Costs included labor costs and costs of materials.\n\n        The Comptroller assessed a total amount due of $14,170.93, including state and\nlocal tax of $12,384.18 and interest of $1,786.75. This assessment was based on the\nComptroller's erroneous determination that Taxpayer could not include as cost of goods\nsold that portion of its Repair Costs attributable to labor and that Taxpayer could not\ninclude as cost of goods sold any of Taxpayer's Subletting Costs.                ·\n\n       Statement of Grounds for Protest\n\n       Taxpayer is entitled to include as cost of goods sold all of its Repair Costs,\nincluding labor costs, and all of its Subletting Costs, including labor costs and costs of\nmaterials. Alternatively, Taxpayer is entitled to include as cost of goods sold the costs of\nmaterials that were included in its Subletting Costs. Without limiting the generality of\nthe preceding statements; Taxpayer provides the following additional information:\n\n1) Under the Texas franchise tax, a taxpayer may elect to deduct the amount of its cost\n   of goods sold from its total revenue in order to calculate its taxable margin. See Tex.\n   Tax Code Ann.§ 171.101(a)(1)(B)(ii)(a).\n\n2) The cost-of-goods-sold deduction includes all direct costs of acquiring or producing\n   goods. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.1012(c). Labor costs and costs of materials are\n   specifically included as costs of goods sold. Id. § 171.1012(c)(l),(2),(3).\n\n3) \"Production\" for purposes of the cost-of-goods-sold deduction \"includes construction,\n   installation, manufacture, development, mining, extraction, improvement, creation,\n   raising, or growth.\" Tex. Tax Code Ann.§ 171.1012(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\n4) Because replacement of automotive parts necessarily involves the installation of\n   tangible personal property, labor costs associated with the replacement and/or\n   installation of automotive parts are cost of goods sold. See Tex. Tax Code §\n   171.1012(a)(2), (c)(1). Therefore, Taxpayer is entitled to include as costs of goods\n   sold the costs attributable to labor in both its Repair Costs and its Subletting Costs.\n\n5) The Comptroller's Rule 3.588(b)(7), which interprets the term \"installation\" that\n   qualifies as production to include only \"installation occurring during the\n   manufacturing or construction process\" does not properly reflect legislative intent and\n   is therefore invalid. See 34 Tex. Admin. Code sec. 3.588(b)(7).\n\n6) The Texas Comptroller has recognized in at least one other context that an\n   automotive repair service company is·in fact engaged in both selling and installing\n   automotive parts. See Comptroller Hearing No. 103,786 (May 10, 20ll)(\"Petitioner\n   provided automotive repair services such as the sale and installation of automotive\n   exhaust systems, transmissions, mufflers, brake linings, glass, and other items from\n   various outlets in Texas.\"). Indeed, this factual fmding has led the Comptroller to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               72\n\f   conclude that such entities may not qualify for the reduced .5% rate. See id\n   (\"Establishments primarily engaged in both selling and installing automotive parts are\n   considered to be engaged in services ....\").\n\n7) In addition, because replacement of automotive parts necessarily ·involves the\n   installation of tangible person property, costs of materials used in the replacement\n   and/or installation of automotive parts are also clearly costs of goods sold. See Tex.\n   Tax Code § 171.1012(a)(2), (c)(2), (3). Therefore, Taxpayer is entitled to include as\n   costs of goods sold all the costs of materials included in its Subletting Costs.\n\n8) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n   labor costs and costs of materials used in the production oftangible personal property\n   for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n   cost of goods sold, results in the disparate treatment of taxpayers within the same\n   class -i.e., businesses producing tangible personal property for sale to customers -in\n   violation of the \"equal and uniform taxation\" requirement of Section 1 of Article 8 of\n   the Texas Constitution. See Tex. Const. art. VIII,§ 1; In re Nestle USA, Inc., No. 12-\n   0518, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5073315</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (Tex. Oct. 19, 2012). The Comptroller's unequal\n   application of the cost-of-goods-sold deduction is in violation of the \"equal and\n   uniform taxation\" requirement in the Texas Constitution because it is arbitrary and\n   not rationally related to any difference that affects the value of the privilege of doing\n   business within Texas. See Nestle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5073315</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at* 7; Bullockv. Sage Energy\n   Co., 728 S.W.2d 465,467-68 (Tex. App.-Austin 1987, writ refdn.r.e.).\n\n9) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n   labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n   for· sale, while allowing other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n   costs of goods sold, constitutes the imposition of unequal rights among taxpayers and\n   the granting of an exclusive separate privilege to certain taxpayers in violation of\n   Section 3 of Article 1 of the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const. art. 1, § 3.\n\n10) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all ~fits\n    labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n    for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n    cost of goods sold, constitutes a violation of Taxpayer's rights under the Equal\n    Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it arbitrarily results in Taxpayer\n    paying more tax than other similarly situated taxpayers. U.S. Canst. amend. XIV, §\n    1.\n\n11) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n    labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n    for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n    cost of goods sold, constitutes a violation of Taxpayer's rights under the Equal\n    Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because Comptroller's disparate treatment\n    of Taxpayer is based on a classification among taxpayers that is not supported by any\n    rational basis and is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               73\n\f12) The Comptroller's denial of Taxpayer's right to include as cost of goods sold all of its\n    labor costs and costs of materials used in the production of tangible personal property\n    for sale, while permitting other similarly situated taxpayers to include such costs as\n    cost of goods sold, constitutes a violation of Taxpayer's rights under the Due Process\n    Clause of the U.S. Constitution because Comptroller's disparate treatment requires\n    Taxpayer to pay more tax for the same right to do business enjoyed by other\n    companies, which constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of Taxpayer's property\n    without due process oflaw.

Determination of Cost of Goods Sold, TX TAX § 171.1012\n\n\n\n\n(f) A taxable entity may subtract as a cost of goods sold indirect or administrative overhead costs, including all mixed service\ncosts, such as security services, legal services, data processing services, accounting services, personnel operations, and general\nfinancial planning and financial management costs, that it can demonstrate are allocable to the acquisition or production of\ngoods, except that the amount subtracted may not exceed four percent of the taxable entity's total indirect or administrative\noverhead costs, including all mixed service costs. Any costs excluded under Subsection (e) may not be subtracted under this\nsubsection.\n\n\n(g) A taxable entity that is allowed a subtraction by this section for a cost of goods sold and that is subject to Section 263A,\n460, or 471, Internal Revenue Code, may capitalize that cost in the same manner and to the same extent that the taxable entity\ncapitalized that cost on its federal income tax return or may expense those costs, except for costs excluded under Subsection\n(e), or in accordance with Subsections (c), (d), and (f). If the taxable entity elects to capitalize costs, it must capitalize each cost\nallowed under this section that it capitalized on its federal income tax return. If the taxable entity later elects to begin expensing\na cost that may be allowed under this section as a cost of goods sold, the entity may not deduct any cost in ending inventory\nfrom a previous report. If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold that may be allowed under this section, a\ncost incurred before the first day of the period on which the report is based may not be subtracted as a cost of goods sold. If\nthe taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold and later elects to capitalize that cost of goods sold, a cost expensed\non a previous report may not be capitalized.\n\n\n(h) A taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods sold, except as otherwise provided by this section, in accordance with the\nmethods used on the federal income tax return on which the report under this chapter is based. This subsection does not affect\nthe type or category of cost of goods sold that may be subtracted under this section.\n\n\n(i) A taxable entity may make a subtraction under this section in relation to the cost of goods sold only if that entity owns the\ngoods. The determination of whether a taxable entity is an owner is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including the\nvarious benefits and burdens of ownership vested with the taxable entity. A taxable entity furnishing labor or materials to a\nproject for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance (as the term “maintenance” is defined\nin 34 T.A.C. Section 3.357) of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may include the costs,\nas allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of goods sold. Solely for purposes of this section, a taxable entity shall\nbe treated as the owner of goods being manufactured or produced by the entity under a contract with the federal government,\nincluding any subcontracts that support a contract with the federal government, notwithstanding that the Federal Acquisition\nRegulation may require that title or risk of loss with respect to those goods be transferred to the federal government before the\nmanufacture or production of those goods is complete.\n\n\n(j) A taxable entity may not make a subtraction under this section for cost of goods sold to the extent the cost of goods sold\nwas funded by partner contributions and deducted under Subsection (c)(13).\n\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution that offers loans to the public\nand elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity, other than an entity primarily engaged in an activity described by category\n5932 of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of Management and Budget, may\nsubtract as a cost of goods sold an amount equal to interest expense. For purposes of this subsection, an entity engaged in\nlending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production offers loans to the public.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

A taxable entity, if eligible, must make an annual election to subtract cost of\n    goods sold in computing margin by the due date, or at the time the report is filed, whichever is later. The election to subtract\n    cost of goods sold is made by filing the franchise tax report using the cost of goods sold method. An amended report may\n    be filed within the time allowed by Tax Code, § 111.107 to change the method of computing margin to the cost of goods\n    sold deduction method or from the cost of goods sold deduction method to the compensation deduction method, 70% of\n    total revenue, or, if otherwise qualified, the E-Z computation method. An election may also be changed as part of an audit.\n    See § 3.584 of this title (relating to Margin: Reports and Payments).\n\n\n    (4) Exclusions from total revenue. Any expense excluded from total revenue (see § 3.587 of this title (relating to Margin:\n    Total Revenue)) may not be included in the determination of cost of goods sold.\n\n\n    (5) Film and broadcasting. A taxable entity whose principal business activity is film or television production or\n    broadcasting or the sale of broadcast rights or the distribution of tangible personal property described by subsection (b)\n    (10)(A)(ii) of this section, or any combination of these activities, and who elects to use cost of goods sold to determine\n    margin, may include as cost of goods sold:\n\n\n         (A) the costs described in this section in relation to the property;\n\n\n         (B) depreciation, amortization, and other expenses directly related to the acquisition, production, or use of the\n         property, including\n\n\n         (C) expenses for the right to broadcast or use the property.\n\n\n    (6) Lending institutions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution\n    that offers loans to the public and elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity may subtract as a cost of goods sold an\n    amount equal to interest expense.\n\n\n         (A) This paragraph does not apply to entities primarily engaged in an activity described by category 5932 of the 1987\n         Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\n         (B) For purposes of this subsection, an entity engaged in lending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production\n         offers loans to the public.\n\n\n    (7) Mixed transactions. If a transaction contains elements of both a sale of tangible personal property and a service, a\n    taxable entity may only subtract as cost of goods sold the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to the tangible\n    personal property sold.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following taxable entities may subtract as\n     cost of goods sold the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to tangible personal property that the entity rents\n     or leases in the ordinary course of business of the entity:\n\n\n          (A) a motor vehicle rental company that remits a tax on gross receipts imposed under Tax Code, § 152.026 or a motor\n          vehicle leasing company;\n\n\n          (B) a heavy construction equipment rental or leasing company; and\n\n\n          (C) a railcar rolling stock rental or leasing company.\n\n\n     (10) Reporting methods.

Most of the taxes under the rule of Mexico came from land dues, tithes, excise duties, stamp tax and custom\n    duties. There were also taxes on income, on the export of coin and silver bullion, on the sale of the right of cock-pit\n    locations, on billiard tables, on capturing mustangs and wild cattle, and on the sale of tobacco. But the state treasury\n    was always in a “reduced” state, implying that the collection methods were probably far from adequate.\n\n    The distinctive features in the tax system of the Republic were the employment of specific duties, the fixing of a\n    minimum valuation of land, and the discrimination against the property of non-residents. Specific duties and minimum\n    valuations were designed to do away with undervaluation. Personal property--slaves, livestock, pleasure carriages,\n    watches, clocks, and land certificates--constituted the most valuable property of the Republic and contributed the\n    largest share of direct taxation. But the frontier counties, being harassed by both Indians and Mexicans resulting in\n    the continual loss or destruction of property, usually failed to pay taxes on personal property.\n\n    There was no provision in the constitution of the Republic enjoining equality and uniformity of taxation, and the result\n    was a mixed system of discriminating ad valorem and specific rates. When Texas became a state in 1845, the taxation\n    section of the constitution (Art. 7, §§ 27, 28) was for the most part patterned after the Louisiana constitution which had\n    been adopted early in 1845. It stipulated that taxation was to be equal and uniform, taxes to be assessed in proportion to\n    the value of the property except that two-thirds of both houses could agree to exempt certain property from taxation. It\n    permitted an income tax on occupations other than agricultural and mechanical pursuits, and exempted from taxation\n    $250 worth of household or other property belonging to each family. This exemption is not found in any other state\n    constitution of that time and is a Texas contribution to constitutional tax law.\n\n    The Constitutions of 1861 and 1866 repeated verbatim the provisos of the Constitution of 1845 (Art. 7, §§ 27, 28,\n    Const.1861; Const.1866), but the Constitution of 1869 dropped the $250 exemption for household furniture.\n\n    By the close of the Civil War a complex tax system had been developed consisting of property and poll taxes, salary\n    and occupation taxes. Under the Constitutions of 1866 and 1869, the property tax was the main source of revenue.\n    Business income and salary taxes were levied by the reconstruction government, but the results were poor, and a\n    gross receipts tax on railroads and telegraph companies and fixed taxes on insurance companies brought in meager\n    returns. General property taxes also fell off considerably for with the emancipation of slaves who had been assessed\n    for taxation at close of $140,000,000 taxable property to that amount was wiped out. The disfavor in which the\n    reconstruction government was held strongly disinclined taxpayers to pay for its support, and there was a vast amount\n    of property which escaped taxation through non-rendition, and in addition there was a great deal of delinquency in\n    the payment of taxes assessed.\n\n    The Constitution of 1876, unlike previous constitutions, limited the state tax on property, exclusive of the tax to pay\n    the public debt, to 50¢ on the $100 valuation of property (Art. 7, § 3). Occupational taxes, except on persons engaged\n    in agricultural and mechanical pursuits were again authorized; a state income tax was permitted; a head tax, called\n    poll tax, was authorized, and a tax of $1 for the benefit of the public schools was made a mandatory levy. In 1881 the\n    poll tax was $2, of which $1 went to the general revenue fund, and $1 to the school fund. In 1882, the general revenue\n    portion of the poll tax was reduced to 50¢ at which figure it has remained. In 1902, the constitutional requirement\n    of the payment of the poll tax as a pre-requisite to voting was adopted (Art. 6, § 2). The Constitution of 1876 also\n    reinstated the $250 exemption for household furniture which had been dropped by the Constitution of 1869.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Equality and uniformity; tax in proportion to value;..., TX CONST Art. 8, § 1\n\n\n\n\n    The legislature attempted various devices to collect delinquent and unrendered property taxes which had accumulated\n    under the reconstruction government, but the huge task of compiling the lists of such property proved to be so\n    cumbersome a task that eventually most of these taxes were waived.\n\n    Property taxes are almost as old as the institution of private property, and are usually the principal source of state\n    revenue; yet in 1946 and again in 1948, because of large surpluses in the treasury no property tax for general revenue\n    was levied in Texas, these being the only two instances of its non-levy in the history of the state.\n\n    A special characteristic of the Texas tax system is the earmarking of receipts to specific functions. The underlying\n    purpose of such earmarking is the desire to guarantee to a state function or service a certain basic amount of revenue,\n    and this accounts for the fact that there is often no logical connection between a particular tax and the fund for which\n    it is earmarked.\n\n    The taxes, all of the proceeds of which go to the general revenue fund, are the inheritance tax, the franchise, the\n    general revenue poll tax, and the domestic charter and foreign corporation permit fees.\n\n    Taxes which are shared one-fourth by the available school fund and three-fourths by the general revenue are the chain\n    store tax; gross receipt taxes on express, telegraph, car companies, pullman companies, and collection agencies; taxes\n    on awards and prizes; and the general occupation taxes.\n\n    Of the net receipts of the vending machine and admissions taxes, the available school fund receives one-fourth, and\n    the old age assistance fund receives the remaining three-fourths.\n\n    Of the net receipts of the motor fuel tax, the available school fund receives one-fourth, the county and district\n    indebtedness fund, one-fourth, and the highway department receives the remaining one-half.\n\n    The proceeds of the boxing and wrestling tax, the citrus fruit tax, the gas utility pipeline tax, and the tax on feed stuffs\n    go to enforcement funds though any unused balance is transferred to the general revenue fund.\n\n    The channeling of the other taxes is through the omnibus clearance fund which was set up in 1941. Into this fund go\n    the receipts from the gross receipts and production taxes on local public utilities, telephone companies, natural and\n    casing head gas, crude oil, carbon black, oil and gas well servicing, motor carriers, insurance companies, auto sales,\n    radio sales, cosmetic sales, and the receipts from taxes on cement distributors, stock share transfers, playing cards\n    and liquor, and cigarettes. Some of this fund is allocated to enforcement, one-fourth of the net after the deduction for\n    enforcement is allocated to the available school fund, and the remainder is divided among the state blind assistance,\n    state dependent children assistance, teachers' retirement, state old age assistance, farm-to-market roads, the foundation\n    school fund, and if anything remains, the general revenue fund.\n\n    The Texas constitution requires equal and uniform taxation. It is generally recognized that all taxpayers are not in\n    equal circumstances and that equal taxation of unequal circumstances would not be a valid application of the principle\n    of equal and uniform taxes. It is generally accepted that equity may be more nearly satisfied if taxpayers in similar\n    circumstances are treated equally. The United States Supreme Court has recognized this principle in its development\n    of the doctrine of reasonable classification. Decisions of that court have sanctioned any classification which has a\n    reasonable relation to some permitted end of governmental action. (See Alward v.

All free men, when they form a social compact, have equal rights, and no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive\nseparate public emoluments, or privileges, but in consideration of public services.\n\n\nEditors' Notes\n\n                                           INTERPRETIVE COMMENTARY\n\n                                                     2007 Main Volume\n\n    All of the constitutions of the State of Texas have contained provisions guaranteeing to all persons equality of rights,\n    the terminology used in Article I, Section 3 being a readoption in the same language of Article I, Section 2 of the\n    Constitutions of 1845, 1861 and 1866. Equality of rights is a concept of republicanism, indigenous to America, finding\n    first expression in the Declaration of Independence. Section 3 of Article I sets forth two meanings of equality, that\n    of equal protection of the laws, and that of political equality.\n\n    Under the United States Constitution, the guaranty of equal protection of the laws was originally assumed by the\n    states, but upon addition of the fourteenth amendment of that constitution the duty was expressly imposed upon the\n    states in the following words: “nor [shall any State] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection\n    of the laws.” Broadly speaking equal protection of the laws means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall\n    be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. All free men have equal rights in the eyes of\n    the government. Justice Field has defined the principle well in the United States Supreme Court case of Barbier v.\n    Connolly, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He declared: “that equal protection and security should be\n    given to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their personal and civil rights; that all persons should be\n    equally entitled to pursue their happiness and acquire and enjoy property; that they should have like access to the\n    courts of the country for the protection of their persons and property, the prevention and redress of wrongs and the\n    enforcement of contracts; that no impediment should be interposed to the pursuits of anyone except as applied to\n    the same pursuits by others under like circumstances; that no greater burden should be laid upon one than are laid\n    upon others in the same calling and conditions, and in the administration of criminal justice no different or higher\n    punishment should be imposed upon one than such as is prescribed to all for like offenses.”\n\n    Equal protection of the law does not prevent classifications in the law which subject some persons to a form of\n    regulation from which others are relieved or confers upon some an advantage denied others. However equal protection\n    does create a test for the classification and requires such to be reasonable, not arbitrary. The classification must be\n    based on reasonable grounds to promote the general peace, good order, morals or health of the community, between\n    classes substantially different from each other, and the classes established must include substantially all those who\n    stand in a similar position with respect to the law. Conversely, if the classification brings about unjust, unreasonable\n    or arbitrary discrimination it will be unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Equal rights, TX CONST Art. 1, § 3\n\n\n    The terminology of Section 3 declaring that “no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive separate public\n    emoluments, or privileges, but in consideration of public services” is said to declare the principle of equality in\n    political rights. The Supreme Court of Texas has asserted that this principle constitutes “...... a denial of all title to\n    individual privileges, honors, and distinctions from the community but for public services. It was directed against\n    superiority of personal and political rights, distinctions of rank, birth, or station, and all claims of emoluments from\n    the community by any man or set of men, over any other citizen of the State.” Glasgow v.

Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the\nwhole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of\nelectors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers\nof a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one\nyears of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the\nbasis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole\nnumber of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n\nSection 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any\noffice, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of\nCongress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of\nany State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or\ngiven aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n\nSection 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of\npensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States\nnor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States,\nor any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n\nSection 5.
