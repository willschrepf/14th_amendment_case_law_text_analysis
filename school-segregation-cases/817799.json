On appeal, Mathews\n\nchallenges the district court’s orders (1) dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nprocedural due process claims against fourteen prison employees for failure to state\n\na claim, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and (2) dismissing his remaining § 1983 claims against Officer\n\nHerman Moss, as a sanction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b),\n\nbecause Mathews submitted fraudulent affidavits. After review, we affirm.\n\n      According to Mathews’s complaint, Officer Moss violated his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights because Moss failed to intervene when three inmates attacked\n\nMathews in the Transitional Care Unit, an inpatient setting for inmates with mental\n\nillness. Mathews alleged that Officer Moss then issued a false disciplinary report,\n\ncharging Mathews with assault and battery as the instigator of the fight.\n\n      While awaiting his disciplinary hearing on the assault and battery charges,\n\nMathews was placed in administrative confinement for a period of 24 days and\n\nthen for another period of 18 days. After the disciplinary hearing, Mathews was\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                Case: 11-14547        Date Filed: 02/08/2013       Page: 3 of 6\n\nfound guilty and placed on “Close Management I” status.1 Mathews filed\n\ngrievances challenging his close management classification, which were denied.\n\nThe other fourteen defendants participated in Mathews’s prison disciplinary\n\nproceedings or in the denial of his subsequent grievances. Mathews’s complaint\n\nalleged that the other defendants violated his procedural due process rights in these\n\ndisciplinary and grievance proceedings.\n\n       The district court did not err in dismissing Mathews’s procedural due\n\nprocess claims against fourteen defendants because Mathews’s complaint did not\n\nallege the deprivation of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. 2\n\nBeing held in administrative confinement for short periods of 24 days and 18 days\n\ndoes not impose an “atypical, significant deprivation” sufficient to give rise to a\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n\n485-87, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 2301-02 (1995) (concluding thirty days of disciplinary\n\n\n       1\n          Under Florida Department of Corrections regulations, administrative confinement is the\ntemporary removal of an inmate from the general population for security and safety pending,\ninter alia, a disciplinary hearing. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 33-602.220(1)(a) & (3)(a). Close\nmanagement classification keeps an inmate, who has demonstrated an inability to avoid abusing\nthe rights of other inmates, apart from the general prison population for security and effective\nmanagement reasons. Id. R. 33-601.800(1)(d).\n       2\n        We review de novo the dismissal of claims under the PLRA, § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii),\napplying the same standards as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and\nviewing the allegations in the complaint as true. Douglas v. Yates, 535 F.3d 1316, 1319-20\n(11th Cir. 2008). To state a claim, the complaint “must be enough to raise a right to relief above\nthe speculative level,” and must contain enough facts to state a claim that is “plausible on its\nface.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965, 1974 (2007).\nAdditionally, we construe pro se pleadings liberally. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d\n1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).\n                                                3\n\f                 Case: 11-14547        Date Filed: 02/08/2013        Page: 4 of 6\n\nsegregation did not give rise to a protected liberty interest); Rodgers v. Singletary,\n\n142 F.3d 1252, 1253 (11th Cir. 1998) (concluding two months in administrative\n\nconfinement did not constitute deprivation of a protected liberty interest). Inmates\n\nalso have no protected liberty interest in a particular custody classification. See\n\nMeachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 223-25, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 2538 (1976) (concluding\n\nno liberty interest in discretionary transfer to a maximum security state prison);\n\nMoody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78, 88 n.9, 97 S. Ct. 274, 279 n.9 (1976) (concluding\n\nno due process protections required for prisoner classification and eligibility for\n\nrehabilitative programs in federal prison). We note that Mathews’s complaint did\n\nnot allege any facts showing (or that could be liberally construed to show) that he\n\nwas confined in harsher conditions than inmates in administrative confinement or\n\nclose management I status generally. Cf. Magluta v. Samples, 375 F.3d 1269,\n\n1275-76, 1282 (11th Cir. 2004) (concluding pretrial detainee’s detailed allegations,\n\nif true, established a liberty interest where pretrial detainee, unlike other pretrial\n\ndetainees or even convicted prisoners, was placed in administrative detention in\n\nconditions that constituted solitary confinement, including being locked in a closet-\n\nsized cell with minimal contact with human beings for over 500 days). 3\n\n\n\n       3\n          Although Mathews argues that mandatory language in Florida’s prison regulations\ncreated liberty interests, the Supreme Court in Sandin made clear that mandatory language in\nstate statutes and prison regulations is insufficient to create a protected liberty interest. See\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84, 115 S. Ct. at 2300.\n                                                  4\n\f                Case: 11-14547        Date Filed: 02/08/2013       Page: 5 of 6\n\n       To the extent Mathews’s complaint alleged that his prison grievances were\n\neither ignored or wrongly decided or that prison officials did not properly follow\n\nthe prison’s own grievance procedures, the Court has concluded that “a prison\n\ngrievance procedure does not provide an inmate with a constitutionally protected\n\ninterest.” Bingham v. Thomas, 654 F.3d 1171, 1177-78 (11th Cir. 2011). Because\n\nMathews’s complaint did not allege facts showing that any protected liberty\n\ninterests were implicated, the district court properly dismissed Mathews’s claims\n\nagainst the fourteen defendants involved in his disciplinary or grievance\n\nproceedings.\n\n       The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed\n\nMathews’s § 1983 claims against Officer Moss under Rule 41(b). 4 The record\n\nshows that Matthews submitted unnotarized affidavits purportedly signed by two\n\nprison inmates, Leonard Jennings and Martinez Guillermo. Subsequently, Officer\n\nMoss submitted notarized affidavits from Jennings and Guillermo stating that they\n\nhad not signed the affidavits submitted by Mathews. Based on this evidence, the\n\ndistrict court did not commit clear error in finding that Mathews willfully\n\nsubmitted false affidavits. The district court also found that lesser sanctions would\n\n\n\n       4\n         We review a district court’s dismissal of a claim under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion\nand its factual findings for clear error. Zocaras v. Castro, 465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir. 2006).\nThe district court may dismiss a claim under Rule 41(b) where there is a clear record of willful\nconduct and the court finds “that lesser sanctions are inadequate to correct such conduct.” Id.\n(quotation marks omitted).\n                                                5\n\f                 Case: 11-14547       Date Filed: 02/08/2013        Page: 6 of 6\n\nnot suffice because of the need to deter other pro se inmates from engaging in\n\nsimilar fraud. Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court’s sanction\n\nof dismissal was an abuse of discretion. 5\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Mathews also challenges a magistrate judge’s order setting aside the entry of default\nagainst Officer Moss. However, in the district court, Mathews failed to object to this\nnondispositive order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) (providing that a party has fourteen days to file\nany objections to a magistrate judge’s nondispositive order and that “[a] party may not assign as\nerror a defect in the order not timely objected to”). Accordingly, Mathews waived his right to\nappeal this ruling. See Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., 487 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2007)\n(“[W]here a party fails to timely challenge a magistrate’s nondispositive order before the district\ncourt, the party waived his right to appeal those orders in this Court.”). In any event, Matthews\nhas not shown that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in setting aside the default entry for\ngood cause.\n                                                 6\n\f",

Samples, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76682\"><a href=\"/opinion/76682/salvador-magluta-v-fp-sam-samples/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1275-76, 1282 (11th Cir. 2004) (concluding pretrial detainee’s detailed allegations,\n\nif true, established a liberty interest where pretrial detainee, unlike other pretrial\n\ndetainees or even convicted prisoners, was placed in administrative detention in\n\nconditions that constituted solitary confinement, including being locked in a closet-\n\nsized cell with minimal contact with human beings for over 500 days). 3\n\n\n\n       3\n          Although Mathews argues that mandatory language in Florida’s prison regulations\ncreated liberty interests, the Supreme Court in Sandin made clear that mandatory language in\nstate statutes and prison regulations is insufficient to create a protected liberty interest. See\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84, 115 S. Ct. at 2300.\n                                                  4\n\f                Case: 11-14547        Date Filed: 02/08/2013       Page: 5 of 6\n\n       To the extent Mathews’s complaint alleged that his prison grievances were\n\neither ignored or wrongly decided or that prison officials did not properly follow\n\nthe prison’s own grievance procedures, the Court has concluded that “a prison\n\ngrievance procedure does not provide an inmate with a constitutionally protected\n\ninterest.” Bingham v.

Because\n\nMathews’s complaint did not allege facts showing that any protected liberty\n\ninterests were implicated, the district court properly dismissed Mathews’s claims\n\nagainst the fourteen defendants involved in his disciplinary or grievance\n\nproceedings.\n\n       The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed\n\nMathews’s § 1983 claims against Officer Moss under Rule 41(b). 4 The record\n\nshows that Matthews submitted unnotarized affidavits purportedly signed by two\n\nprison inmates, Leonard Jennings and Martinez Guillermo. Subsequently, Officer\n\nMoss submitted notarized affidavits from Jennings and Guillermo stating that they\n\nhad not signed the affidavits submitted by Mathews. Based on this evidence, the\n\ndistrict court did not commit clear error in finding that Mathews willfully\n\nsubmitted false affidavits. The district court also found that lesser sanctions would\n\n\n\n       4\n         We review a district court’s dismissal of a claim under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion\nand its factual findings for clear error.

However, in the district court, Mathews failed to object to this\nnondispositive order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) (providing that a party has fourteen days to file\nany objections to a magistrate judge’s nondispositive order and that “[a] party may not assign as\nerror a defect in the order not timely objected to”). Accordingly, Mathews waived his right to\nappeal this ruling. See Smith v. Sch.
