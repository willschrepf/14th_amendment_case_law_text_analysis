Alvarez, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: January 24, 2018\n\nREVERSED AND DISMISSED\n\n           Appellee Adrian Comer sued his employer, Appellant Texas Department of Aging and\n\nDisability Services (DADS), for discrimination based on his disability, failure to provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation, and retaliation. DADS’s plea to the jurisdiction challenged the\n\nexistence of jurisdictional facts and asserted its immunity from suit. The trial court denied the\n\nplea, and DADS appeals. Because DADS conclusively negated at least one essential element of\n\neach of Comer’s claims, and Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, we reverse the\n\ntrial court’s order and dismiss Comer’s suit for want of jurisdiction.\n\f                                                                                                   04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n                                                 BACKGROUND\n\n        Adrian Comer was employed by the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services,\n\na state agency that serves aging people and those with cognitive and physical disabilities. Comer\n\nworked for DADS for about sixteen years as a Direct Support Professional (DSP) at the San\n\nAntonio State Supported Living Center (SASSLC). 1 The Center provides round-the-clock care\n\nfor its residents through its staff, including DSPs such as Comer. After Comer had some health\n\nissues, Comer’s doctor certified that Comer was fit for duty as a DSP, but only for one eight-hour\n\nshift per day, and the shift had to be at night.\n\n        DADS insisted that an essential function of a DSP is to work a second, consecutive eight-\n\nhour shift when needed, and that requirement applied to Comer. Comer contended that he has a\n\ndisability and excusing him from the mandatory overtime policy2 was a reasonable\n\naccommodation. DADS disagreed and would not reinstate Comer as a DSP. DADS asserts it was\n\nunable to find another job that Comer was qualified to fill, with or without a reasonable\n\naccommodation, and it terminated Comer’s employment.\n\n        Comer sued DADS and alleged it discriminated against him because of his disability\n\nbecause DADS failed to accommodate Comer’s request to work only a night shift and not more\n\nthan eight hours at a time. Comer also sued DADS for retaliation alleging DADS fired him because\n\nhe filed an EEOC grievance about DADS’s failure to provide his requested accommodation.\n\n        In its plea to the jurisdiction, DADS argued that Comer failed to allege a prima facie case\n\nfor any of his claims, its immunity from suit was not waived for any of Comer’s claims, and the\n\n\n1\n Comer started work for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (TDMHMR) in March 1999.\nTDMHMR was dissolved in 2004 and DADS took over responsibility for the SASSLC.\n2\n The Rotational Coverage Policy was implemented on October 13, 2014, revised on January 14, 2015, and formally\napproved on January 22, 2015. By its plain language, the policy applies to DSP I, II, and III personnel. It requires\nemployees designated on the Rotational Shift Record Book to stay until released, and any “[s]taff that leaves without\nbeing released will be subject to disciplinary action.”\n\n                                                        -2-\n\f                                                                                                  04-17-00224-CV\n\n\ntrial court had no jurisdiction over Comer’s suit. After a hearing, the trial court denied the plea,\n\nand DADS appeals arguing that its immunity from suit was not waived. 3\n\n                                           IMMUNITY FROM SUIT\n\n        Governmental units have immunity from suit except where that immunity is waived by the\n\nlegislature. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 101.025 (West 2011); Mission Consol.\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d 629, 635–36 (Tex. 2012). The legislature, through the\n\nTexas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA), 4 waived a governmental unit’s immunity\n\n“for those suits where the plaintiff actually alleges a violation of the TCHRA by pleading facts\n\nthat state a claim thereunder.” Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 636.\n\n        It is the plaintiff’s burden to allege a prima facie case—to plead facts that, if\n\nuncontroverted, establish each essential element of the cause of action. See id. at 632, 637; see\n\nalso In re Lipsky, 460 S.W.3d 579, 590 (Tex. 2015) (“[A] ‘prima facie case’ . . . refers to evidence\n\nsufficient as a matter of law to establish a given fact if it is not rebutted or contradicted.”).\n\n        “[I]f a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, we consider\n\nrelevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issues\n\nraised, as the trial court is required to do.” Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\n217, 227 (Tex. 2004); accord Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635.\n\n        After the plaintiff meets its burden to allege a prima facie case, if “the state asserts and\n\nsupports with evidence that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, we simply require the\n\nplaintiff[], when the facts underlying the merits and subject matter jurisdiction are intertwined, to\n\n\n\n3\n It is undisputed that DADS is a governmental unit under the Texas Tort Claims Act.

PRAC. & REM.\nCODE ANN. § 101.002 (West 2011) (identifying Chapter 101 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code as the Texas\nTort Claims Act).\n4\n See Act of May 12, 1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 269, § 1, sec. 21.001, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 987, 993 (codified at TEX.\nLABOR CODE § 21.001).\n\n                                                       -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nshow that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional issue.” Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\nat 228; accord Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635, 637; Mesquite Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Mendoza, 441\n\nS.W.3d 340, 343 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.) (citing Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637) (noting\n\nthat if a plaintiff pleads facts for each element of a prima facie case but the defendant “present[s]\n\nevidence negating those facts, . . . the plaintiff must then present evidence in support of the\n\n[plaintiff’s pleaded] facts.” (emphasis added)).\n\n       If the defendant’s “evidence affirmatively negate[s] a jurisdictional fact,” City of Waco v.\n\nLopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 150 (Tex. 2008), and the plaintiff “fails to raise a fact question on the\n\njurisdictional issue,” Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228, the governmental\n\nunit’s immunity is not waived and the claim may be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, see Garcia,\n\n372 S.W.3d at 637; Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n                                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       In reviewing a trial court’s “ruling on a plea to the jurisdiction, [we] must determine\n\nwhether facts have been alleged that affirmatively demonstrate jurisdiction in the trial court.”\n\nLopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150 (citing Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 225). We liberally construe the\n\npleadings in the plaintiff’s favor, but we “must also consider evidence tending to negate the\n\nexistence of jurisdictional facts when necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issues raised.” Id.\n\n(citing Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227); accord Tex. Dep’t of State Health Servs. v. Rockwood, 468\n\nS.W.3d 147, 154 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2015, no pet.) (“[We] consider whether [the plaintiff]\n\npled the basic facts that make up a prima facie case for [his] TCHRA claims and whether the\n\nDepartment conclusively negated one of those basic facts.”).\n\n       The questions of “[w]hether a pleader has alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate a\n\ntrial court’s subject matter jurisdiction,” Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226, whether the State has\n\nnegated the existence of the plaintiff’s jurisdictional facts, Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150, and whether\n                                                   -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nthe plaintiff has successfully raised a fact question on the jurisdictional issue are questions of law\n\nwe review de novo, id. (citing Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226–28).\n\n                                        DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\n\n         Comer alleges DADS violated the TCHRA by its acts against him of discrimination and\n\nretaliation.   See TEX. LABOR CODE ANN. §§ 21.051 (Discrimination by Employer), 21.055\n\n(Retaliation) (West 2015). As a part of his discrimination claim, Comer alleges DADS failed to\n\nprovide him with his requested reasonable accommodation. We begin with the discrimination\n\nclaim.\n\nA.       DADS Arguments\n\n         DADS argues the trial court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction against Comer’s\n\ndiscrimination claim because Comer failed to meet his burden to show that he has a disability and\n\nthat he is qualified for the job. DADS insists (1) there is no evidence that Comer is disabled, (2)\n\nComer’s own evidence conclusively proves Comer cannot perform all the essential functions of a\n\nDSP, and (3) his requested accommodation of waiving the mandatory overtime policy as to Comer\n\nis not reasonable as a matter of law.\n\nB.       Comer’s Arguments\n\n         Comer contends DADS fired him because of his disability. He insists he can perform all\n\nthe essential functions of a DSP with the reasonable accommodation of DADS allowing him to\n\nwork only nights and not more than eight hours per day. Comer cites his affidavit as evidence that\n\nthe mandatory overtime policy has been waived as to other employees, and thus he has raised a\n\nfact question on whether mandatory overtime is an essential function of his job.\n\nC.       Applicable Law\n\n         The anti-discrimination statute at issue here is section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code; it\n\nreads as follows:\n                                                 -5-\n\f                                                                                     04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n           An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n                (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n                    discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n                    with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n                    employment; or\n                (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n                    employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n                    individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n                    other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTEX. LABOR CODE ANN. § 21.051.\n\n       “Because the TCHRA was enacted in part to ‘provide for the execution of the policies of\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments,’ we look to relevant\n\nfederal law for guidance when the relevant provisions of Title VII are analogous.” San Antonio\n\nWater Sys. v. Nicholas, 461 S.W.3d 131, 136–37 (Tex. 2015); accord Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 633–\n\n34.\n\n       “To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show that (1)\n\nhe has a ‘disability;’ (2) he is ‘qualified’ for the job; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment\n\ndecision because of his disability.” Donaldson v. Tex. Dep’t of Aging & Disability Servs., 495\n\nS.W.3d 421, 436 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, pet. denied); accord Rockwood, 468\n\nS.W.3d at 156; Davis v. City of Grapevine, 188 S.W.3d 748, 765 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006,\n\npet. denied).\n\n       “In determining whether a plaintiff is a ‘qualified individual’ with a disability, the court\n\nmust first determine whether the plaintiff can perform the essential functions of the job he holds.”\n\nDavis, 188 S.W.3d at 765 (quoting Chandler v. City of Dall., 2 F.3d 1385, 1393 (5th Cir. 1993));\n\naccord Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 436.\n\n       “The plaintiff can show the ‘qualification’ element in one of two ways: (1) by proving that\n\nhe can perform all essential job functions with or without modifications or accommodations; or\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                                                         04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n(2) by showing that some reasonable accommodation by the employer would enable him to\n\nperform the job.” Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 437 (citing Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 101\n\nF.3d 1090, 1093 (5th Cir. 1996)).\n\n        “We cannot say that [the plaintiff] can perform the essential functions of the job with\n\nreasonable accommodation, if the only successful accommodation is for [the plaintiff] not to\n\nperform those essential functions.” Barber v. Nabors Drilling U.S.A., Inc., 130 F.3d 702, 709 (5th\n\nCir. 1997). A function is essential if it “bear[s] more than a marginal relationship to the job at\n\nissue.” Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393; accord Tex. Dep’t of Family & Protective Servs. v. Howard,\n\n429 S.W.3d 782, 790 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied).\n\n        “If the court concludes that the plaintiff is not able to perform the essential functions of the\n\njob, the court must then determine whether any reasonable accommodation by the employer would\n\nenable the plaintiff to perform those functions.” Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 766. It is the plaintiff’s\n\nburden “to demonstrate, as part of his prima facie case, that an accommodation of his disability\n\nexists and that such accommodation is reasonable.” Id. at 763.\n\n        “If no reasonable accommodation would enable the plaintiff to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of his position, then he is not a ‘qualified individual’ with a disability.” Id. at 766; accord\n\nBarber, 130 F.3d at 709.\n\nD.      Analysis\n\n        To meet his burden to allege a prima facie case of discrimination, Comer had to plead facts\n\nthat he (1) has a disability, (2) he was a qualified individual for the DSP I job, and (3) DADS\n\nterminated his employment because of his alleged disability. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 436;\n\nDavis, 188 S.W.3d at 765.\n\n        In our review of the pleadings and evidence, we take as true the evidence favorable to\n\nComer, including the statements in his affidavit. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n                                                  -7-\n\f                                                                                              04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n        1.       Comer’s Prima Facie Evidence\n\n        Comer filed an affidavit that identified Joe Compian and DeeAnn Ramirez as former\n\nDADS employees who Comer avers were excused from compliance with the mandatory overtime\n\npolicy. 5 Comer’s affidavit does not state the dates that Compian or Ramirez were excused from\n\ncomplying with the mandatory overtime policy, but making a reasonable inference in Comer’s\n\nfavor, we infer that Compian and Ramirez were granted an accommodation of not complying with\n\nthe mandatory overtime policy. See id.\n\n        Comer filed a doctor’s Fitness for Duty Certification, dated September 3, 2015, that states\n\nComer was fit for duty except that he could not work more than eight hours at a time. He also\n\nfiled a doctor’s note dated January 28, 2016, reiterating that Comer could work no more than eight\n\nhours per day and should work only at night.\n\n        Construing Comer’s pleadings liberally in favor of jurisdiction, we conclude Comer pled\n\nfacts for each element and he met his burden to allege a prima facie case of discrimination. See\n\nTEX. LABOR CODE ANN. § 21.051; Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637.\n\n        2.       DADS’s Negating Evidence\n\n        DADS submitted evidence to affirmatively negate Comer’s jurisdictional facts, and we\n\nmust consider it. See Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227.\n\n        DADS’s evidence includes two affidavits and a Position Statement. DADS argues that its\n\nevidence shows Compian and Ramirez, the former DADS employees Comer cited in his affidavit,\n\nended their employment with DADS before the mandatory overtime policy was officially\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Comer’s affidavit also included statements from two other former DADS employees opining that mandatory\novertime was not always enforced. DADS objected to the two statements as hearsay. The trial court sustained the\nobjections and struck those statements from Comer’s affidavit. We do not consider the stricken statements.\n\n                                                     -8-\n\f                                                                                             04-17-00224-CV\n\n\napproved, and thus there is no evidence that the mandatory overtime policy was ever waived as a\n\nreasonable accommodation since the policy was formally approved in January 2015.\n\n        DADS filed an affidavit from Amy Tippie, Deputy Director of Human Resources at Texas\n\nHealth and Human Services Commission. 6 Tippie’s affidavit states that Compian left DADS’s\n\nemployment in 2007, years before the Rotational Coverage Policy was implemented on October\n\n13, 2014. Tippie’s affidavit also states that Ramirez left DADS’s employ on December 1, 2014,\n\nwhich is after the mandatory overtime policy was implemented but before it was formally\n\napproved.\n\n        DADS also filed an affidavit from Ralph Henry, the Director of the SASSLC, which states\n\n“[the Center] has never discharged a DSP employee from compliance with its Rotational\n\n[C]overage [P]olicy as an accommodation request, including Plaintiff. Compliance with this\n\npolicy is mandatory for all DSP staff at the SASSLC.”\n\n        DADS’s evidence also includes a Position Statement from the Civil Rights Director at\n\nTexas HHSC that states “working a second shift or beyond one eight hour shift is an essential\n\nfunction of the [DSP] job.”\n\n        DADS’s evidence affirmatively negated Comer’s prima facie evidence that mandatory\n\novertime was not an essential function of the DSP position. See Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150;\n\nMendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343.\n\n        3.      Comer’s Burden to Raise a Fact Question\n\n        To raise a fact question on whether the mandatory overtime policy was an essential\n\nfunction of the DSP position, Comer had the burden to produce some evidence that a DSP\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Tippie’s affidavit shows the dates that the employees ended their employment with DADS was February 1, 2007,\nfor Joe Compian and December 1, 2014, for DeeAnn Ramirez.\n\n                                                     -9-\n\f                                                                                       04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nemployee had been excused from the mandatory overtime policy after it was implemented. See\n\nLopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28; Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343.\n\n       Comer failed to produce any evidence that any DADS employee was ever granted an\n\naccommodation by being excused from complying with the mandatory overtime policy that was\n\nimplemented on October 13, 2014. Contra Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150; Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at\n\n343. From Comer’s prima facie evidence case, we could infer that fact, but once DADS submitted\n\nevidence that affirmatively negated that jurisdictional fact, Comer had the burden to present\n\nevidence to raise a fact question. See Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343 (noting that if the defendant\n\n“present[s] evidence negating [jurisdictional] facts, . . . the plaintiff must then present evidence in\n\nsupport of the [plaintiff’s pleaded] facts” (emphasis added)); see also Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635.\n\nBut Comer did not present any evidence. Contra Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Mendoza, 441\n\nS.W.3d at 343. Thus, Comer failed to raise a fact question on whether complying with the\n\nmandatory overtime policy was an essential function of the DSP position. See Lopez, 259 S.W.3d\n\nat 150; Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343.\n\n       4.      DADS’s Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n       DADS’s evidence that the mandatory overtime policy was an essential function of the DSP\n\njob stands unrebutted by any evidence from Comer. Henry’s affidavit states that no Center\n\nemployee has been granted an accommodation by being excused from complying with the\n\nmandatory overtime policy. Henry’s statement covers the relevant period—the time after which\n\nthe policy was implemented or formally approved.\n\n       Comer does not aver that he has knowledge of any DADS employee that was granted an\n\naccommodation and excused from compliance with the mandatory overtime policy after it was\n\nimplemented or formally approved. Further, Comer’s own evidence establishes that he was not\n\nable to work beyond an eight-hour shift, which is an essential function of the DSP position.\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                    04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n       Because the evidence, for the purposes of this plea to the jurisdiction, conclusively\n\nestablishes that Comer was unable to perform an essential function of the DSP position, we move\n\nto the second question—“whether any reasonable accommodation by [DADS] would enable\n\n[Comer] to perform those functions.” See Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 766.\n\n                              FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE CLAIM\n\n       DADS argues that its immunity from suit was not waived for Comer’s failure to\n\naccommodate claim because Comer failed to meet his prima facie evidence burden.\n\n       For a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on an\n       employer’s failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, the plaintiff must show:\n       (1) that he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2)\n       that an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) that with\n       reasonable accommodations he could perform the essential functions of the\n       position; and (4) that the employer has refused to make such accommodations.\n\nDavis, 188 S.W.3d at 758 (footnote omitted). Further, it is the plaintiff’s burden “to demonstrate,\n\nas part of his prima facie case, that an accommodation of his disability exists and that such\n\naccommodation is reasonable.” Id. at 763.\n\n       Of the four prongs identified by Davis, three need little discussion. For the first, DADS\n\nasserts that Comer is not disabled, but because another prong is dispositive, we need not address\n\nthe first. For the second, DADS does not dispute that it had notice of Comer’s medical conditions;\n\nfor the fourth, the parties agree that DADS did not grant Comer his requested accommodation.\n\n       The remaining prong is the third: whether Comer—with or without a reasonable\n\naccommodation—could perform the essential functions of the DSP position. See id. at 758. Comer\n\npleads that waiving the mandatory overtime policy with respect to him is a reasonable\n\naccommodation, and his affidavit states that DADS has waived the policy for others.\n\n       But DADS submitted evidence that mandatory overtime was an essential function of the\n\nDSP position. It submitted a copy of the mandatory overtime policy, it emphasized the importance\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f                                                                                    04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nof the policy in maintaining a minimum acceptable level of staffing to ensure patient safety and\n\ncare in case oncoming shift members failed to show up, and it recited the need for a balanced\n\nburden of overtime among all its DSP staff. See Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393 (describing a function\n\nas essential if it “bear[s] more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue”); accord Howard,\n\n429 S.W.3d at 790. It also provided the Texas HHSC’s Position Statement, which, after it\n\nconducted an independent investigation, concluded that “working a second shift or beyond one\n\neight hour shift is an essential function of the [DSP] job.”\n\n       This evidence affirmatively negates Comer’s unsupported statement that working\n\nmandatory overtime was not an essential function of the DSP position; Comer’s statement that\n\nother employees were excused from the mandatory overtime policy—given his statement’s\n\ncomplete lack of dates or instances—is no evidence. Considering all the evidence, we conclude\n\nthat DADS’s affidavits and the other evidence establish that the mandatory overtime policy is an\n\nessential function of the DSP job, see Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393; Howard, 429 S.W.3d at 790, and\n\nComer’s pleadings and affidavit fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact, see Garcia, 372\n\nS.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n           DISPOSITION OF DISCRIMINATION, FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE CLAIMS\n\n       Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that he was “a ‘qualified individual’\n\nwith a disability,” an essential element of a discrimination claim, because he cannot perform the\n\nessential functions of a DSP position and he provided no evidence of a reasonable accommodation\n\nthat would allow him to perform all the essential functions of a DSP. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d\n\nat 436; Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 766. Comer insists, and his own evidence shows, he cannot work\n\nmore than one eight-hour shift per day. See Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 765; accord Donaldson, 495\n\nS.W.3d at 436.\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n       DADS’s evidence conclusively established that the mandatory overtime policy is an\n\nessential function of the DSP position, see Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393; Howard, 429 S.W.3d at 790,\n\nand Comer failed to produce any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on that question,\n\nsee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n       Further, DADS was not obligated to relieve Comer from the essential function of working\n\nmandatory overtime, to create a new type of position to fit Comer’s limitation, or to assign existing\n\nDSPs to cover Comer’s mandatory overtime shifts. See Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 763 (“[T]he ADA\n\ndoes not require an employer to relieve an employee of any essential functions of his or her job,\n\nmodify those duties, reassign existing employees to perform those jobs, or hire new employees to\n\ndo so.” (citing Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 621 (5th Cir. 1999)); see also Barber,\n\n130 F.3d at 709 (“We cannot say that [the plaintiff] can perform the essential functions of the job\n\nwith reasonable accommodation, if the only successful accommodation is for [the plaintiff] not to\n\nperform those essential functions.”); Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 101 F.3d 1090, 1094 (5th\n\nCir. 1996) (“[A]n accommodation that would result in other employees having to work harder or\n\nlonger is not required under the ADA.”).\n\n       Taking the evidence favoring Comer as true, we nevertheless conclude that DADS\n\nestablished that (1) working overtime as required by the mandatory overtime policy is an essential\n\nfunction of the DSP position and (2) Comer’s proposed accommodation of waiving the mandatory\n\novertime policy as to him was not a reasonable accommodation. See Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393\n\n(essential function); Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 758 (accommodation burden on plaintiff). DADS met\n\nits burden, but Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on either question. See Garcia,\n\n372 S.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                    04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n       Therefore, DADS’s immunity was not waived, and the trial court should have granted\n\nDADS’s plea to the jurisdiction on Comer’s discrimination and failure to accommodate claims.\n\nSee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n                                      RETALIATION CLAIM\n\n       In his original petition, Comer claims he was wrongfully terminated for filing a grievance\n\nabout DADS’s failure to provide him with a reasonable accommodation, and that his involuntary\n\ntermination was DADS’s act of retaliation.\n\nA.     Applicable Law\n\n       “In an action arising under [Texas Labor Code section 21.055], the plaintiff must first make\n\na prima facie showing that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment\n\naction occurred, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse\n\naction.” Dias v. Goodman Mfg. Co., L.P., 214 S.W.3d 672, 676 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2007, pet. denied) (citing Pineda v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 360 F.3d 483, 487 (5th Cir. 2004));\n\naccord San Antonio Water Sys. v. Nicholas, 461 S.W.3d 131, 137 (Tex. 2015).\n\n       Evidence sufficient to establish a causal link between an adverse employment\n       decision and a protected activity may include: “(1) the employer’s failure to follow\n       its usual policy and procedures in carrying out the challenged employment actions;\n       (2) discriminatory treatment in comparison to similarly situated employees; (3)\n       knowledge of the discrimination charge or suit by those making the adverse\n       employment decision; (4) evidence that the stated reason for the adverse\n       employment decision was false; and (5) the temporal proximity between the\n       employee’s conduct and discharge.”\n\nDonaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444. Without other evidence to establish a causal link, the temporal\n\nproximity between the protected activity and the adverse action becomes especially important;\n\ncourts have determined that, without other evidence, periods of six, five, four, and even three\n\nmonths between the activity and the adverse action are too long to support a causal link. See Clark\n\nCty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (reciting periods of three and four months as\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f                                                                                   04-17-00224-CV\n\n\ntoo long—without other evidence of causality); Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444 (reciting periods\n\nof five and six months as too long).\n\nB.     Comer’s Burden\n\n       Comer had an initial burden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Dias, 214\n\nS.W.3d at 676; Rockwood, 468 S.W.3d at 154 (“[A] plaintiff’s failure to demonstrate the elements\n\nof a prima facie case means the trial court has no jurisdiction.”).\n\n       If DADS met its evidentiary burden, Comer had the burden to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact on his retaliation claim. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228; see also Garcia, 372\n\nS.W.3d at 635, 637. If Comer failed to raise a fact issue, then DADS’s immunity was not waived.\n\nSee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\nC.     Evidence of Retaliation\n\n       DADS does not argue that Comer’s filing a grievance was not a protected activity. Comer\n\nfiled his grievance on December 8, 2015; DADS supervisors knew about Comer’s grievance\n\nwithin weeks after he filed it; and Comer was involuntarily terminated on June 20, 2016. See Dias,\n\n214 S.W.3d at 676 (elements of retaliation claim).\n\n       The remaining question on the jurisdictional evidence pertaining to Comer’s retaliation\n\nclaim is whether there was a causal link between Comer’s grievance and his involuntary\n\ntermination. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444 (listing types of evidence to show a causal link).\n\nComer did not submit any evidence of a causal link—other than his unsupported allegation in his\n\npleadings that DADS terminated him because he filed a grievance. In his affidavit, Comer does\n\nnot make any statement that supports his allegation of retaliation or point to any other evidence\n\nestablishing a causal link. Contra id. The only remaining factor to establish a causal link is the\n\ntemporal proximity of Comer’s grievance and his involuntary termination. Those events were\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                     04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nseparated by about six months, and without other evidence, a six-month gap between the two\n\nevents is no evidence of causality. See Breeden, 532 U.S. at 274; Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444.\n\nD.     DADS’s Evidence Negated Causal Link\n\n       Comer failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, but assuming arguendo he did,\n\nDADS offered controverting evidence to affirmatively negate a causal link. See Lopez, 259\n\nS.W.3d at 150.\n\n       In its plea to the jurisdiction, DADS submitted numerous documents as evidence that it\n\nfollowed its personnel procedures in addressing Comer’s absences and fitness for duty\n\ncertifications. Its evidence included statements and documents showing that other similarly-\n\nsituated employees without disabilities were also terminated. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444.\n\n       In his response, Comer did not offer any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact\n\non causal link nor did he make any argument that he had done so. See id. (elements of retaliation);\n\nsee also Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635 (plaintiff’s burden). Similarly, in his appellate brief, Comer\n\nargues only that he raised a fact question on whether the mandatory overtime policy was an\n\nessential function of the DSP position—an element of his discrimination and failure to\n\naccommodate claims—not that he raised a genuine issue of material fact on his retaliation claim.\n\nSee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635 (requiring plaintiff, if defendant negates existence of jurisdictional\n\nfact, to raise genuine issue of material fact on challenged element).\n\n       We conclude Comer failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Donaldson,\n\n495 S.W.3d at 444. Even assuming he did, after DADS negated his jurisdictional evidence, Comer\n\ndid not submit any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on a causal link—an essential\n\nelement of his retaliation claim. See Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Dias, 214 S.W.3d at 676. Thus,\n\nfor his retaliation claim, Comer failed to establish a prima facie case or raise a genuine issue of\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nmaterial fact, and DADS’s immunity was not waived. See Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637; Miranda,\n\n133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       For his discrimination and failure to accommodate claims, Comer met his burden to\n\nestablish a prima facie case. But after DADS’s evidence affirmatively negated the existence of\n\nComer’s jurisdictional facts, Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nchallenged elements in either claim. Thus, DADS’s immunity was not waived, and the trial court\n\nshould have granted DADS’s plea on these claims.\n\n       For his retaliation claim, Comer failed to meet his prima facie burden or raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact on a causal link between his filing a grievance and his involuntary\n\ntermination. He failed to show that DADS’s immunity from suit was waived, and the trial court\n\nshould have granted DADS’s plea on the retaliation claim.\n\n       Because DADS met its burden to conclusively negate the existence of Comer’s\n\njurisdictional facts on each of Comer’s claims, and Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact on the challenged essential elements, the trial court should have granted DADS’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction and dismissed the suit. We reverse the trial court’s order and dismiss Comer’s suit for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.\n\n                                                   Patricia O.

Because DADS conclusively negated at least one essential element of\n\neach of Comer’s claims, and Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, we reverse the\n\ntrial court’s order and dismiss Comer’s suit for want of jurisdiction.\n\f                                                                                                   04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n                                                 BACKGROUND\n\n        Adrian Comer was employed by the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services,\n\na state agency that serves aging people and those with cognitive and physical disabilities. Comer\n\nworked for DADS for about sixteen years as a Direct Support Professional (DSP) at the San\n\nAntonio State Supported Living Center (SASSLC). 1 The Center provides round-the-clock care\n\nfor its residents through its staff, including DSPs such as Comer. After Comer had some health\n\nissues, Comer’s doctor certified that Comer was fit for duty as a DSP, but only for one eight-hour\n\nshift per day, and the shift had to be at night.\n\n        DADS insisted that an essential function of a DSP is to work a second, consecutive eight-\n\nhour shift when needed, and that requirement applied to Comer. Comer contended that he has a\n\ndisability and excusing him from the mandatory overtime policy2 was a reasonable\n\naccommodation. DADS disagreed and would not reinstate Comer as a DSP. DADS asserts it was\n\nunable to find another job that Comer was qualified to fill, with or without a reasonable\n\naccommodation, and it terminated Comer’s employment.\n\n        Comer sued DADS and alleged it discriminated against him because of his disability\n\nbecause DADS failed to accommodate Comer’s request to work only a night shift and not more\n\nthan eight hours at a time. Comer also sued DADS for retaliation alleging DADS fired him because\n\nhe filed an EEOC grievance about DADS’s failure to provide his requested accommodation.\n\n        In its plea to the jurisdiction, DADS argued that Comer failed to allege a prima facie case\n\nfor any of his claims, its immunity from suit was not waived for any of Comer’s claims, and the\n\n\n1\n Comer started work for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (TDMHMR) in March 1999.\nTDMHMR was dissolved in 2004 and DADS took over responsibility for the SASSLC.\n2\n The Rotational Coverage Policy was implemented on October 13, 2014, revised on January 14, 2015, and formally\napproved on January 22, 2015. By its plain language, the policy applies to DSP I, II, and III personnel. It requires\nemployees designated on the Rotational Shift Record Book to stay until released, and any “[s]taff that leaves without\nbeing released will be subject to disciplinary action.”\n\n                                                        -2-\n\f                                                                                                  04-17-00224-CV\n\n\ntrial court had no jurisdiction over Comer’s suit. After a hearing, the trial court denied the plea,\n\nand DADS appeals arguing that its immunity from suit was not waived. 3\n\n                                           IMMUNITY FROM SUIT\n\n        Governmental units have immunity from suit except where that immunity is waived by the\n\nlegislature.

See TEX. LABOR CODE ANN. §§ 21.051 (Discrimination by Employer), 21.055\n\n(Retaliation) (West 2015). As a part of his discrimination claim, Comer alleges DADS failed to\n\nprovide him with his requested reasonable accommodation. We begin with the discrimination\n\nclaim.\n\nA.       DADS Arguments\n\n         DADS argues the trial court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction against Comer’s\n\ndiscrimination claim because Comer failed to meet his burden to show that he has a disability and\n\nthat he is qualified for the job. DADS insists (1) there is no evidence that Comer is disabled, (2)\n\nComer’s own evidence conclusively proves Comer cannot perform all the essential functions of a\n\nDSP, and (3) his requested accommodation of waiving the mandatory overtime policy as to Comer\n\nis not reasonable as a matter of law.\n\nB.       Comer’s Arguments\n\n         Comer contends DADS fired him because of his disability. He insists he can perform all\n\nthe essential functions of a DSP with the reasonable accommodation of DADS allowing him to\n\nwork only nights and not more than eight hours per day. Comer cites his affidavit as evidence that\n\nthe mandatory overtime policy has been waived as to other employees, and thus he has raised a\n\nfact question on whether mandatory overtime is an essential function of his job.\n\nC.       Applicable Law\n\n         The anti-discrimination statute at issue here is section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code; it\n\nreads as follows:\n                                                 -5-\n\f                                                                                     04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n           An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n                (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n                    discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n                    with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n                    employment; or\n                (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n                    employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n                    individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n                    other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTEX.

Analysis\n\n        To meet his burden to allege a prima facie case of discrimination, Comer had to plead facts\n\nthat he (1) has a disability, (2) he was a qualified individual for the DSP I job, and (3) DADS\n\nterminated his employment because of his alleged disability. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 436;\n\nDavis, 188 S.W.3d at 765.\n\n        In our review of the pleadings and evidence, we take as true the evidence favorable to\n\nComer, including the statements in his affidavit. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n                                                  -7-\n\f                                                                                              04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n        1.       Comer’s Prima Facie Evidence\n\n        Comer filed an affidavit that identified Joe Compian and DeeAnn Ramirez as former\n\nDADS employees who Comer avers were excused from compliance with the mandatory overtime\n\npolicy. 5 Comer’s affidavit does not state the dates that Compian or Ramirez were excused from\n\ncomplying with the mandatory overtime policy, but making a reasonable inference in Comer’s\n\nfavor, we infer that Compian and Ramirez were granted an accommodation of not complying with\n\nthe mandatory overtime policy. See id.\n\n        Comer filed a doctor’s Fitness for Duty Certification, dated September 3, 2015, that states\n\nComer was fit for duty except that he could not work more than eight hours at a time. He also\n\nfiled a doctor’s note dated January 28, 2016, reiterating that Comer could work no more than eight\n\nhours per day and should work only at night.\n\n        Construing Comer’s pleadings liberally in favor of jurisdiction, we conclude Comer pled\n\nfacts for each element and he met his burden to allege a prima facie case of discrimination. See\n\nTEX. LABOR CODE ANN. § 21.051; Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637.\n\n        2.       DADS’s Negating Evidence\n\n        DADS submitted evidence to affirmatively negate Comer’s jurisdictional facts, and we\n\nmust consider it. See Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227.\n\n        DADS’s evidence includes two affidavits and a Position Statement. DADS argues that its\n\nevidence shows Compian and Ramirez, the former DADS employees Comer cited in his affidavit,\n\nended their employment with DADS before the mandatory overtime policy was officially\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Comer’s affidavit also included statements from two other former DADS employees opining that mandatory\novertime was not always enforced. DADS objected to the two statements as hearsay. The trial court sustained the\nobjections and struck those statements from Comer’s affidavit. We do not consider the stricken statements.\n\n                                                     -8-\n\f                                                                                             04-17-00224-CV\n\n\napproved, and thus there is no evidence that the mandatory overtime policy was ever waived as a\n\nreasonable accommodation since the policy was formally approved in January 2015.\n\n        DADS filed an affidavit from Amy Tippie, Deputy Director of Human Resources at Texas\n\nHealth and Human Services Commission. 6 Tippie’s affidavit states that Compian left DADS’s\n\nemployment in 2007, years before the Rotational Coverage Policy was implemented on October\n\n13, 2014. Tippie’s affidavit also states that Ramirez left DADS’s employ on December 1, 2014,\n\nwhich is after the mandatory overtime policy was implemented but before it was formally\n\napproved.\n\n        DADS also filed an affidavit from Ralph Henry, the Director of the SASSLC, which states\n\n“[the Center] has never discharged a DSP employee from compliance with its Rotational\n\n[C]overage [P]olicy as an accommodation request, including Plaintiff. Compliance with this\n\npolicy is mandatory for all DSP staff at the SASSLC.”\n\n        DADS’s evidence also includes a Position Statement from the Civil Rights Director at\n\nTexas HHSC that states “working a second shift or beyond one eight hour shift is an essential\n\nfunction of the [DSP] job.”\n\n        DADS’s evidence affirmatively negated Comer’s prima facie evidence that mandatory\n\novertime was not an essential function of the DSP position. See Lopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150;\n\nMendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343.\n\n        3.      Comer’s Burden to Raise a Fact Question\n\n        To raise a fact question on whether the mandatory overtime policy was an essential\n\nfunction of the DSP position, Comer had the burden to produce some evidence that a DSP\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Tippie’s affidavit shows the dates that the employees ended their employment with DADS was February 1, 2007,\nfor Joe Compian and December 1, 2014, for DeeAnn Ramirez.\n\n                                                     -9-\n\f                                                                                       04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nemployee had been excused from the mandatory overtime policy after it was implemented. See\n\nLopez, 259 S.W.3d at 150; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28; Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343.\n\n       Comer failed to produce any evidence that any DADS employee was ever granted an\n\naccommodation by being excused from complying with the mandatory overtime policy that was\n\nimplemented on October 13, 2014.

From Comer’s prima facie evidence case, we could infer that fact, but once DADS submitted\n\nevidence that affirmatively negated that jurisdictional fact, Comer had the burden to present\n\nevidence to raise a fact question. See Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343 (noting that if the defendant\n\n“present[s] evidence negating [jurisdictional] facts, . . . the plaintiff must then present evidence in\n\nsupport of the [plaintiff’s pleaded] facts” (emphasis added)); see also Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635.\n\nBut Comer did not present any evidence. Contra Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Mendoza, 441\n\nS.W.3d at 343. Thus, Comer failed to raise a fact question on whether complying with the\n\nmandatory overtime policy was an essential function of the DSP position. See Lopez, 259 S.W.3d\n\nat 150; Mendoza, 441 S.W.3d at 343.\n\n       4.      DADS’s Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\n       DADS’s evidence that the mandatory overtime policy was an essential function of the DSP\n\njob stands unrebutted by any evidence from Comer. Henry’s affidavit states that no Center\n\nemployee has been granted an accommodation by being excused from complying with the\n\nmandatory overtime policy. Henry’s statement covers the relevant period—the time after which\n\nthe policy was implemented or formally approved.\n\n       Comer does not aver that he has knowledge of any DADS employee that was granted an\n\naccommodation and excused from compliance with the mandatory overtime policy after it was\n\nimplemented or formally approved. Further, Comer’s own evidence establishes that he was not\n\nable to work beyond an eight-hour shift, which is an essential function of the DSP position.\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                    04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n       Because the evidence, for the purposes of this plea to the jurisdiction, conclusively\n\nestablishes that Comer was unable to perform an essential function of the DSP position, we move\n\nto the second question—“whether any reasonable accommodation by [DADS] would enable\n\n[Comer] to perform those functions.” See Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 766.\n\n                              FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE CLAIM\n\n       DADS argues that its immunity from suit was not waived for Comer’s failure to\n\naccommodate claim because Comer failed to meet his prima facie evidence burden.\n\n       For a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on an\n       employer’s failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, the plaintiff must show:\n       (1) that he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2)\n       that an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) that with\n       reasonable accommodations he could perform the essential functions of the\n       position; and (4) that the employer has refused to make such accommodations.\n\nDavis, 188 S.W.3d at 758 (footnote omitted). Further, it is the plaintiff’s burden “to demonstrate,\n\nas part of his prima facie case, that an accommodation of his disability exists and that such\n\naccommodation is reasonable.” Id. at 763.\n\n       Of the four prongs identified by Davis, three need little discussion. For the first, DADS\n\nasserts that Comer is not disabled, but because another prong is dispositive, we need not address\n\nthe first. For the second, DADS does not dispute that it had notice of Comer’s medical conditions;\n\nfor the fourth, the parties agree that DADS did not grant Comer his requested accommodation.\n\n       The remaining prong is the third: whether Comer—with or without a reasonable\n\naccommodation—could perform the essential functions of the DSP position. See id. at 758. Comer\n\npleads that waiving the mandatory overtime policy with respect to him is a reasonable\n\naccommodation, and his affidavit states that DADS has waived the policy for others.\n\n       But DADS submitted evidence that mandatory overtime was an essential function of the\n\nDSP position. It submitted a copy of the mandatory overtime policy, it emphasized the importance\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f                                                                                    04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nof the policy in maintaining a minimum acceptable level of staffing to ensure patient safety and\n\ncare in case oncoming shift members failed to show up, and it recited the need for a balanced\n\nburden of overtime among all its DSP staff. See Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393 (describing a function\n\nas essential if it “bear[s] more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue”); accord Howard,\n\n429 S.W.3d at 790. It also provided the Texas HHSC’s Position Statement, which, after it\n\nconducted an independent investigation, concluded that “working a second shift or beyond one\n\neight hour shift is an essential function of the [DSP] job.”\n\n       This evidence affirmatively negates Comer’s unsupported statement that working\n\nmandatory overtime was not an essential function of the DSP position; Comer’s statement that\n\nother employees were excused from the mandatory overtime policy—given his statement’s\n\ncomplete lack of dates or instances—is no evidence. Considering all the evidence, we conclude\n\nthat DADS’s affidavits and the other evidence establish that the mandatory overtime policy is an\n\nessential function of the DSP job, see Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393; Howard, 429 S.W.3d at 790, and\n\nComer’s pleadings and affidavit fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact, see Garcia, 372\n\nS.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n           DISPOSITION OF DISCRIMINATION, FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE CLAIMS\n\n       Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that he was “a ‘qualified individual’\n\nwith a disability,” an essential element of a discrimination claim, because he cannot perform the\n\nessential functions of a DSP position and he provided no evidence of a reasonable accommodation\n\nthat would allow him to perform all the essential functions of a DSP. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d\n\nat 436; Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 766. Comer insists, and his own evidence shows, he cannot work\n\nmore than one eight-hour shift per day. See Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 765; accord Donaldson, 495\n\nS.W.3d at 436.\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n       DADS’s evidence conclusively established that the mandatory overtime policy is an\n\nessential function of the DSP position, see Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393; Howard, 429 S.W.3d at 790,\n\nand Comer failed to produce any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on that question,\n\nsee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n       Further, DADS was not obligated to relieve Comer from the essential function of working\n\nmandatory overtime, to create a new type of position to fit Comer’s limitation, or to assign existing\n\nDSPs to cover Comer’s mandatory overtime shifts. See Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 763 (“[T]he ADA\n\ndoes not require an employer to relieve an employee of any essential functions of his or her job,\n\nmodify those duties, reassign existing employees to perform those jobs, or hire new employees to\n\ndo so.” (citing Burch v.

See Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1393\n\n(essential function); Davis, 188 S.W.3d at 758 (accommodation burden on plaintiff). DADS met\n\nits burden, but Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on either question. See Garcia,\n\n372 S.W.3d at 635; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                    04-17-00224-CV\n\n\n       Therefore, DADS’s immunity was not waived, and the trial court should have granted\n\nDADS’s plea to the jurisdiction on Comer’s discrimination and failure to accommodate claims.\n\nSee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n                                      RETALIATION CLAIM\n\n       In his original petition, Comer claims he was wrongfully terminated for filing a grievance\n\nabout DADS’s failure to provide him with a reasonable accommodation, and that his involuntary\n\ntermination was DADS’s act of retaliation.\n\nA.

Without other evidence to establish a causal link, the temporal\n\nproximity between the protected activity and the adverse action becomes especially important;\n\ncourts have determined that, without other evidence, periods of six, five, four, and even three\n\nmonths between the activity and the adverse action are too long to support a causal link.

Comer’s Burden\n\n       Comer had an initial burden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Dias, 214\n\nS.W.3d at 676; Rockwood, 468 S.W.3d at 154 (“[A] plaintiff’s failure to demonstrate the elements\n\nof a prima facie case means the trial court has no jurisdiction.”).\n\n       If DADS met its evidentiary burden, Comer had the burden to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact on his retaliation claim. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228; see also Garcia, 372\n\nS.W.3d at 635, 637. If Comer failed to raise a fact issue, then DADS’s immunity was not waived.\n\nSee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\nC.     Evidence of Retaliation\n\n       DADS does not argue that Comer’s filing a grievance was not a protected activity. Comer\n\nfiled his grievance on December 8, 2015; DADS supervisors knew about Comer’s grievance\n\nwithin weeks after he filed it; and Comer was involuntarily terminated on June 20, 2016. See Dias,\n\n214 S.W.3d at 676 (elements of retaliation claim).\n\n       The remaining question on the jurisdictional evidence pertaining to Comer’s retaliation\n\nclaim is whether there was a causal link between Comer’s grievance and his involuntary\n\ntermination. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444 (listing types of evidence to show a causal link).\n\nComer did not submit any evidence of a causal link—other than his unsupported allegation in his\n\npleadings that DADS terminated him because he filed a grievance. In his affidavit, Comer does\n\nnot make any statement that supports his allegation of retaliation or point to any other evidence\n\nestablishing a causal link. Contra id. The only remaining factor to establish a causal link is the\n\ntemporal proximity of Comer’s grievance and his involuntary termination. Those events were\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                     04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nseparated by about six months, and without other evidence, a six-month gap between the two\n\nevents is no evidence of causality. See Breeden, 532 U.S. at 274; Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444.\n\nD.     DADS’s Evidence Negated Causal Link\n\n       Comer failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, but assuming arguendo he did,\n\nDADS offered controverting evidence to affirmatively negate a causal link. See Lopez, 259\n\nS.W.3d at 150.\n\n       In its plea to the jurisdiction, DADS submitted numerous documents as evidence that it\n\nfollowed its personnel procedures in addressing Comer’s absences and fitness for duty\n\ncertifications. Its evidence included statements and documents showing that other similarly-\n\nsituated employees without disabilities were also terminated. See Donaldson, 495 S.W.3d at 444.\n\n       In his response, Comer did not offer any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact\n\non causal link nor did he make any argument that he had done so. See id. (elements of retaliation);\n\nsee also Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635 (plaintiff’s burden). Similarly, in his appellate brief, Comer\n\nargues only that he raised a fact question on whether the mandatory overtime policy was an\n\nessential function of the DSP position—an element of his discrimination and failure to\n\naccommodate claims—not that he raised a genuine issue of material fact on his retaliation claim.\n\nSee Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635 (requiring plaintiff, if defendant negates existence of jurisdictional\n\nfact, to raise genuine issue of material fact on challenged element).\n\n       We conclude Comer failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Donaldson,\n\n495 S.W.3d at 444. Even assuming he did, after DADS negated his jurisdictional evidence, Comer\n\ndid not submit any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on a causal link—an essential\n\nelement of his retaliation claim. See Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635; Dias, 214 S.W.3d at 676. Thus,\n\nfor his retaliation claim, Comer failed to establish a prima facie case or raise a genuine issue of\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00224-CV\n\n\nmaterial fact, and DADS’s immunity was not waived. See Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637; Miranda,\n\n133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       For his discrimination and failure to accommodate claims, Comer met his burden to\n\nestablish a prima facie case. But after DADS’s evidence affirmatively negated the existence of\n\nComer’s jurisdictional facts, Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nchallenged elements in either claim. Thus, DADS’s immunity was not waived, and the trial court\n\nshould have granted DADS’s plea on these claims.\n\n       For his retaliation claim, Comer failed to meet his prima facie burden or raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact on a causal link between his filing a grievance and his involuntary\n\ntermination. He failed to show that DADS’s immunity from suit was waived, and the trial court\n\nshould have granted DADS’s plea on the retaliation claim.\n\n       Because DADS met its burden to conclusively negate the existence of Comer’s\n\njurisdictional facts on each of Comer’s claims, and Comer failed to raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact on the challenged essential elements, the trial court should have granted DADS’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction and dismissed the suit. We reverse the trial court’s order and dismiss Comer’s suit for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.\n\n                                                   Patricia O.
