Civil Action No. 11-2261 (JDB)\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND\nSECURITY,\n\n        Defendant.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       The Electronic Privacy Information Center (\"EPIC\") brings this action against the United\n\nStates Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") under the Freedom of Information Act\n\n(\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 552. Before the Court is [25] EPIC's motion for attorney's fees, and [28]\n\nDHS's motion to strike a portion of [27] EPIC's reply brief in support of its fee motion. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, EPIC's motion for attorney's fees will be granted in part and denied in\n\npart, and DHS's motion to strike will be denied.\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       On February 1, 2011, DHS published notice in the Federal Register announcing its intent\n\nto create a new system to monitor social media networks, titled \"Publicly Available Social Media\n\nMonitoring and Situational Awareness Initiatives.\" Compl. [Docket Entry 1] ¶ 5; see also 76\n\nFed. Reg. 5603, No. DHS-2011-0003 (Feb. 1, 2011). The program was designed to monitor\n\n\"publicly available online forums, blogs, public websites, and message boards,\" and \"disseminate\n\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\frelevant and appropriate de-identified information to federal, state, local, and foreign\n\ngovernments, and private sector partners.\" 76 Fed. Reg. at 5603.\n\n       EPIC filed a FOIA request \"[i]n order to allow the public to assess the privacy risks to\n\nsocial media users, on April 12, 2011.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Att'y's Fees [Docket Entry 25] at 3. Eight\n\nmonths later, DHS had not produced any documents. Compl. ¶ 27. Hence, EPIC filed this\n\nlawsuit, seeking an injunction to compel DHS to comply with FOIA. Id. ¶ 38. DHS began\n\nproducing responsive documents three weeks later. Over the next year, DHS made rolling\n\nproductions, totaling approximately five hundred pages of documents, some of which were\n\npartially redacted. See Decl. of James Holzer, Attach. 3 to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Docket\n\nEntry 12-3] ¶¶ 15-17; Decl. of Julie Ferrell (\"Ferrell Decl.\"), Attach. 5 to Def.'s Mot. for Summ.\n\nJ. [Docket Entry 12-5] ¶¶ 26-29. DHS also withheld 230 responsive documents under various\n\nFOIA exemptions. Ferrell Decl. ¶ 29.\n\n       DHS then moved for summary judgment, arguing that it had adequately searched for and\n\nproduced all responsive, nonexempt records. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Docket Entry 12] at 8.\n\nEPIC filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, making two objections to DHS's efforts to\n\ncomply with their FOIA request: (1) that DHS's Vaughn index was insufficient, and (2) that DHS\n\nshould have produced in redacted form seven documents from the Secret Service that had been\n\nwithheld in their entirety (\"the Secret Service documents\"). Pl.'s Opp'n & Cross Mot. for Summ.\n\nJ. (\"Pl.'s MSJ\") [Docket Entry 16] at 1. EPIC also requested attorney's fees and costs. Id. at 14.\n\n       DHS disputed both of EPIC's arguments, and asked the Court to defer ruling on EPIC's\n\nrequest for attorney's fees. Def.'s Reply & Opp'n [Docket Entry 20] at 1-2. But despite arguing\n\nfor several pages that their original Vaughn index was proper, DHS attached an updated, more-\n\nspecific Vaughn index. See Updated Vaughn Index (Oct. 26, 2012), Attach. 1 to Def.'s Reply &\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fOpp'n [Docket Entry 20-1]. In doing so, DHS maintained its position that \"the original Index\n\nwas sufficient,\" but admitted that it \"could be made more clear.\" Def.'s Reply & Opp'n at 6.\n\nSatisfied with the updated version, EPIC then withdrew its objections to DHS's Vaughn index,\n\nwhile continuing to press its objections to DHS's withholding of the Secret Service documents,\n\nand renewing its request for attorney's fees and costs. Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. [Docket Entry 22] at 1-2.\n\n       This Court granted in part and denied in part both parties' motions for summary\n\njudgment. See Mar. 4, 2013 Mem. Op. [Docket Entry 23]. The Court ordered DHS to produce\n\nsix of the seven Secret Service documents in redacted form, but found that one of the seven had\n\nbeen properly withheld in full, finding that the non-exempt portions were not reasonably\n\nsegregable. See id.; see also Mar. 4, 2013 Order [Docket Entry 24]. The Court did not rule on\n\nEPIC's request for attorney's fees, and instead ordered \"that, pursuant to Local Civil Rule 54.2(a),\n\nthe parties shall confer and attempt to reach an agreement on fee issues.\" Mar. 4, 2013 Order.\n\nAlthough the Court was \"not deciding the issue\" at that time, \"it note[d], in the hope of guiding\n\nthe parties' discussions, that EPIC will be entitled to some amount of fees and costs, given the\n\nagency's release of responsive documents, the Vaughn index revisions, and the Court's resolution\n\nof the instant motions.\" Mar. 4, 2013 Mem. Op. at 9.\n\n       The Court's optimism for an agreement on fees and costs proved unfounded—EPIC filed\n\nits motion for attorney's fees the following month. In its opposition brief, DHS made reference\n\nto a settlement offer that EPIC had rejected. See Def.'s Opp'n to Mot. for Att'y's Fees (\"Def.'s\n\nOpp'n\") [Docket Entry 26] at 18. In its reply, EPIC actually included the relevant settlement\n\ncommunication, revealing to the Court (and anyone monitoring the public docket) the amount for\n\nwhich DHS had offered to settle the fee issue. See Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Mot. for\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fAtt'y's Fees (\"Pl.'s Reply\") [Docket Entry 27-2]. Three days later, DHS filed a motion to strike\n\nthe portions of EPIC's reply brief referencing the settlement offer, citing the bar in Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 408 to the admissibility of settlement communications \"to prove or disprove the\n\nvalidity or amount of a disputed claim.\" Fed. R. Evid. 408(a).\n\n                                     LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       The Freedom of Information Act provides that courts \"may assess against the United\n\nStates reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case . . . in\n\nwhich the complainant has substantially prevailed.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(i). This statutory\n\nlanguage \"naturally divides the attorney-fee inquiry into two prongs,\" which the D.C. Circuit\n\n\"has long described as fee 'eligibility' and fee 'entitlement.'\" Brayton v. Office of the U.S. Trade\n\nRepresentative, 641 F.3d 521, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Under the eligibility prong, a court \"asks\n\nwhether a plaintiff has 'substantially prevailed' and thus 'may' receive fees.\" Id. A FOIA\n\nrequester \"has substantially prevailed if the complainant has obtained relief through either\" a\n\ncourt order or \"a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency, if the complainant's\n\nclaim is not insubstantial.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(ii); see also Brayton, 641 F.3d at 525 (\"[T]he\n\nOPEN Government Act of 2007 . . . revived the possibility of FOIA fee awards in the absence of\n\na court decree.\").\n\n       If the requester is eligible for a fee award, a court \"proceeds to the entitlement prong and\n\nconsiders a variety of factors to determine whether the plaintiff should receive fees.\" Brayton,\n\n641 F.3d at 524; accord Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce, 470 F.3d 363, 368-69\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (Judicial Watch I). The four \"entitlement\" factors are: \"(1) the public benefit\n\nderived from the case, (2) the commercial benefit to the requester, (3) the nature of the\n\nrequester's interest in the information, and (4) the reasonableness of the agency's conduct.\"\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fMorley v. CIA, 719 F.3d 689, 690 (D.C. Cir. 2013). In applying this test, \"[n]o one factor is\n\ndispositive.\" Davy v. CIA, 550 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 2008). \"The sifting of those criteria\n\nover the facts of a case is a matter of district court discretion.\" Tax Analysts v. DOJ, 965 F.2d\n\n1092, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n        Finally, if a court determines that a FOIA requester is both eligible for and entitled to\n\nattorney's fees, the court must calculate the proper amount of the fee award. The first step \"is to\n\nestablish the 'lodestar': the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable\n\nhourly rate.\" Nat'l Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec'y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1323 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1982). Once properly calculated, \"the lodestar may be adjusted to reflect various other factors.\"\n\nId. This process is also one of district court discretion, as the D.C. Circuit has recognized \"that\n\nsome of the elements of this formula [are] necessarily somewhat imprecise.\" Id.; see also\n\nCopeland v. Marshall, 641 F.2d 880, 893 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (en banc) (\"[W]e ask only that the\n\ndistrict court judges exercise their discretion as conscientiously as possible, and state their\n\nreasons as clearly as possible.\").\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n        As DHS essentially concedes, EPIC is both eligible for and entitled to an award of\n\nattorney's fees and costs. The parties vigorously dispute the amount of fees, however, with EPIC\n\nrequesting $37,197.75 in fees and costs, and DHS proposing a meager $1,992.50. DHS offers a\n\nvariety of objections to EPIC's proposal.      Some have merit; others do not.        After briefly\n\nanalyzing the questions of \"eligibility\" and \"entitlement,\" the Court will consider each objection\n\nin turn. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that EPIC is entitled to most, but not all\n\nof the fees it has requested, and will order a total award of $29,841.67 in attorney's fees and $350\n\nin costs.\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f    I.        EPIC is eligible for attorney's fees.\n\n         EPIC is eligible for attorney's fees, because it has \"substantially prevailed\" within the\n\nmeaning of FOIA. There are two ways to satisfy the \"substantially prevailed\" requirement under\n\nFOIA, and EPIC meets both. First, EPIC \"obtained relief through . . . a judicial order.\" 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)(I). Faced with cross-motions for summary judgment, this Court granted in\n\npart and denied in part both parties' motions. See Mar. 4, 2013 Mem. Op. at 9-10. But EPIC\n\nobtained nearly all of the relief it was seeking, as the Court ordered DHS to produce all\n\nreasonably segregable portions of six of the seven documents that remained in dispute. Id. True,\n\nthis Court denied EPIC's motion with respect to one of the seven Secret Service documents, but a\n\nFOIA requester can still \"substantially prevail\" even when it obtains less-than-full relief. See,\n\ne.g., Judicial Watch I, 470 F.3d at 371 (FOIA requester awarded fees after a partial litigation\n\nvictory). 1\n\n         EPIC's advocacy also caused \"a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency,\"\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)(II). After producing nothing in response to EPIC's FOIA request for\n\napproximately eight months, DHS released hundreds of responsive documents within three\n\nweeks of receiving EPIC's complaint in this action. Similarly, DHS produced a revised Vaughn\n\nindex meeting EPIC's proposed specifications, after EPIC took issue with DHS's first attempt. 2\n\nThese tangible successes further support the common-sense notion that EPIC has \"substantially\n\nprevailed\" in this matter. See, e.g., Brayton, 641 F.3d at 525 (\"[P]laintiffs can now qualify as\n\n'substantially prevailing,' and thus become eligible for attorney fees, without winning court-\n\nordered relief on the merits of their FOIA claims.\"). Presumably for these reasons, DHS does\n\n         1\n           Whether EPIC is entitled to all of its fees for work on issues for which it did not prevail\nis a different question, which the Court will consider in further detail infra, Section IV.E.\n         2\n           DHS does not argue that EPIC's Vaughn index objections were \"insubstantial,\" 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)(II), so the Court will not consider the argument.\n\n                                                  6\n\fnot meaningfully dispute that EPIC is eligible for fees as a prevailing party under FOIA. See\n\ngenerally Def.'s Opp'n.\n\n   II.       EPIC is entitled to attorney's fees.\n\n         Next, the Court applies the D.C. Circuit's four-factor test to determine whether EPIC is\n\nentitled to fees. The Court must consider: \"(1) the public benefit derived from the case, (2) the\n\ncommercial benefit to the requester, (3) the nature of the requester's interest in the information,\n\nand (4) the reasonableness of the agency's conduct.\" Morley, 719 F.3d at 690.\n\n         The \"public benefit\" factor \"requires consideration of both the effect of the litigation for\n\nwhich fees are requested and the potential public value of the information sought.\" Davy, 550\n\nF.3d at 1159. As FOIA requests go, the public benefit derived from this one was exceptional.\n\nEPIC obtained and disclosed documents relating to a matter subject to an ongoing national\n\ndebate: the tension between individual privacy interests and the national-security needs of our\n\ngovernment in the digital age. Regardless of one's views on the merits, there is no doubt that\n\nEPIC's FOIA request made a contribution to this national conversation. Documents obtained\n\nthrough the request were analyzed in the Washington Post.             See Ellen Nakashima, DHS\n\nMonitoring of Social Media Concerns Civil Liberties Advocates, The Washington Post, Jan. 13,\n\n2012 (\"[M]onitoring for 'positive and negative reports' on U.S. agencies falls outside the\n\ndepartment's mission to 'secure the nation,' said the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which\n\nobtained a copy of a contract and related material describing DHS's social media monitoring\n\nthrough its FOIA suit.\"). 3 And EPIC's FOIA work on this matter was discussed by several other\n\nprominent media outlets. See, e.g., Privacy Group Sues DHS Over Social Media Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n         3\n        Available at http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-01-13/world/35441734_1_social-\nmedia-dhs-documents-reports\n\n                                                    7\n\fProgram, FOXNews.com, Dec. 24, 2011; 4 Liz Klimas, Which Keywords on Twitter Get the\n\nGovernment's Attention?, The Blaze, Dec. 28, 2011; 5 Mark Hosenball, Homeland Security\n\nWatches Twitter, Social Media, Reuters, Jan. 11, 2012; 6 Jaikumar Vijayan, DHS Media\n\nMonitoring Could Chill Public Dissent, EPIC Warns, Computer World, Jan. 16, 2012; 7 Mark\n\nRockwell, DHS Social Media Monitoring Practices Revealed Under FOIA, Government Security\n\nNews, May 29, 2012; 8 Robert N.

Ever., IT World, May 31, 2012. 11\n\n       In addition to the substantial media coverage, documents arising out of EPIC's FOIA\n\nrequest were also heavily featured at a congressional hearing devoted to DHS's social media\n\nmonitoring.   See, e.g., DHS Monitoring of Social Networking and Media: Enhancing\n\nIntelligence Gathering and Ensuring Privacy, Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Counterterrorism\n\nand Intelligence of the H. Comm. on Homeland Security, 112th Cong. (\"Homeland Security\n\nHr'g\") (Feb. 16, 2012) (statement of Rep. Speier, Ranking Member) (\"I am deeply troubled by\n       4\n           Available at http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/12/24/privacy-group-sues-dhs-ov\ner-social-media-monitoring-program/\n        5\n           Available at http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2011/12/28/which-keywords-on-twitter-\nget-the-governments-attention/\n        6\n           Available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/11/us-usa-homelandsecurity-web\nsites-idUSTRE80A1RC20120111\n        7\n           Available at http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223441/DHS_media_monitorin\ng _could_chill_public_dissent_EPIC_warns\n        8\n            Available at http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/26448\n        9\n           Available at http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/internet/do-you-need-to-be-\ncareful-about-the-words-you-use-in-social-media-conversations\n        10\n            Available at http://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2012/05/26/department-of-ho\nmeland-security-forced-to-release-list-of-keywords-used-to-monitor-social-networking-sites/2/\n        11\n            Available at http://www.itworld.com/security/279429/dhs-list-words-you-should-nev\ner-ever-blog-or-tweet-ever\n\n                                              8\n\fthe document that has just been put into the record by epic.org.\"). This is the sort of public\n\nbenefit that FOIA was designed to promote.\n\n       Next, \"[t]he second and third factors, which are often considered together, assess whether\n\na plaintiff has 'sufficient private incentive to seek disclosure' without attorney's fees.\" Davy, 550\n\nF.3d at 1160 (quoting Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1095). \"The second factor considers the\n\ncommercial benefit to the plaintiff, while the third factor considers the plaintiff's interest in the\n\nrecords.\" Id. These factors also favor non-profit organizations like EPIC, which \"aim to ferret\n\nout and make public worthwhile, previously unknown government information—precisely the\n\nactivity that FOIA's fees provision seeks to promote.\" Id. As the D.C. Circuit has explained,\n\nthose \"requesters who seek documents for public informational purposes\" are favored by FOIA,\n\nand they \"engage in the kind of endeavor for which a public subsidy makes some sense.\" Id.\n\nAnd even if some private benefit accrued to EPIC by means of their success, \"Congress did not\n\nintend for scholars (or journalists and public interest groups) to forego compensation when\n\nacting within the scope of their professional roles.\" Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20, 35-36 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1998). Hence, the second and third factors also favor EPIC.\n\n       Finally, the fourth factor, \"the reasonableness of the agency's conduct,\" does not strongly\n\nweigh in favor of either party.        True, the Court held that DHS violated its statutory\n\nresponsibilities in responding to EPIC's FOIA request—but that will be true in any FOIA case in\n\nwhich the plaintiff obtains court-ordered relief. DHS also produced a revised Vaughn index\n\nupon receiving plaintiff's objections, obviating the need for a judicial determination on that issue.\n\nDHS's conduct—while no doubt falling short of FOIA's requirements—was not egregiously\n\nunreasonable. Hence, the fourth factor is more or less neutral in this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f          Considering all four factors together, the Court finds that EPIC is not just \"eligible,\" but\n\nis also \"entitled\" to attorney's fees under FOIA's fee-shifting provision.            DHS essentially\n\nconcedes as much in its opposition brief, which focuses on the amount of fees to be awarded.\n\nSee Def.'s Opp'n at 1 (\"While we do not dispute that EPIC is entitled to some fees in proportion\n\nto its minimal success, its request of $30,590.75 is unreasonably excessive and wholly\n\nunsupported.\").\n\n   III.         EPIC is entitled to \"fees on fees.\"\n\n          EPIC asks not only for attorney's fees for the underlying litigation, but also for its work in\n\nlitigating this fee motion—that is, \"fees on fees.\" 12 DHS opposes this request, primarily on the\n\ngrounds that EPIC \"vexatiously imposed unnecessary burdens on defendant and the Court\" by\n\nrejecting DHS's settlement offers, and by refusing to consent to an extension of time to continue\n\nsettlement negotiations. See Def.'s Opp'n at 18-19.\n\n          As EPIC argues—and DHS does not appear to dispute—\"[i]t 'is settled in this circuit' that\n\n'hours reasonably devoted to a request for fees are compensable.'\" Judicial Watch, Inc. v. DOJ,\n\n878 F. Supp. 2d 225, 240 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-B-Que\n\nRest., 771 F.2d 521, 528 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). Although there appears to be no D.C. Circuit case\n\nlaw applying this principle in the FOIA context, other courts in this district have done so without\n\nhesitation. See, e.g., id.; EPIC v. DHS, 811 F. Supp. 2d 216, 140 (D.D.C. 2011) (\"[H]ours\n\n'reasonably expended' in preparing a fee petition are compensable.\"). This Court agrees—there\n\nis no reason to treat FOIA's fee-shifting provision differently than those for which the D.C.\n\nCircuit has approved awards of \"fees on fees.\" See, e.g., Noxell, 771 F.2d at 528 (upholding\n\n\"fees on fees\" under the Lanham Act); Sierra Club v. EPA, 769 F.2d 796, 811-12 (D.C. Cir.\n\n\n\n          12\n               EPIC does not seek attorney's fees for its opposition to DHS's motion to strike.\n\n                                                      10\n\f1985) (upholding \"fees on fees\" under the Clean Air Act).         Hence, EPIC is entitled to a\n\nreasonable award of attorney's fees for litigating this motion.\n\n   IV.         EPIC's fee award will be reduced in the Court's discretion.\n\n         The Court will now exercise its discretion to calculate a \"reasonable\" fee award, as\n\ndirected by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(i). The Court will begin with EPIC's request for $36,847.75\n\nin fees and $350 in costs, 13 and will ultimately reduce that amount slightly, for a variety of\n\nreasons.\n\n                   A. Starting Point: Laffey and the Lodestar\n\n         \"The usual method of calculating a reasonable fee amount is to 'multiply the hours\n\nreasonably expended in the litigation by a reasonable hourly fee, producing the 'lodestar'\n\namount.'\" Judicial Watch, Inc. v. DOJ, 774 F. Supp. 2d 225, 232 (D.D.C. 2011) (Judicial Watch\n\nII) (quoting Bd. of Trs. of Hotel & Rest. Emps. Local 25 v. JPR, Inc., 136 F.3d 794, 801 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1998). To determine a \"reasonable\" hourly rate, the Court considers \"the prevailing market\n\nrates in the relevant community, regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or non-\n\nprofit counsel.\" Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984). Of course, non-profit counsel may\n\nnot actually bill for their services. To solve this problem, \"[f]or public-interest or government\n\nlawyers who do not have customary billing rates, courts in this circuit have frequently employed\n\nthe 'Laffey Matrix,' a schedule of fees based on years of attorney experience.\" Judicial Watch II,\n\n774 F. Supp. 2d at 232; see also Covington v. District of Columbia, 57 F.3d 1101, 1105-12 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995) (approving of the Laffey matrix and affirming fee award calculated with it). Using\n\nthe Laffey matrix, EPIC calculated a lodestar of $36,847.75. DHS does not question EPIC's\n\n\n\n\n         13\n              DHS does not object to an award of $350 in costs.\n\n                                                  11\n\farithmetic, but it does object to the total number of hours and the hourly rate charged by three of\n\nEPIC's attorneys. The Court now turns to these objections. 14\n\n               B. Hourly Rate of Attorneys Brody, Horwitz, and Scott\n\n       DHS objects to the hourly rate charged by three of the seven EPIC attorneys who billed\n\ntime on this matter: David R. Brody, Julia Horwitz, and Jeramie D. Scott. See Def.'s Opp'n at\n\n16-18. EPIC billed these attorneys at a rate of $245 per hour, which corresponds to the Laffey\n\nrate for attorneys with \"1-3 years\" of legal experience. But as DHS points out, and EPIC does\n\nnot dispute, none of these attorneys—all 2012 law school graduates—were admitted to practice\n\nlaw in any jurisdiction while they worked on this case. Id. at 16. Hence, they are more properly\n\ncategorized under the heading \"Paralegals & Law Clerks,\" based upon their bar status during the\n\nrelevant time period, and the fact that they had not yet achieved \"1-3 years\" of legal experience.\n\nSee EPIC, 811 F. Supp. 2d at 238 (\"[B]ecause the plaintiff does not refute that one of its\n\nattorneys, Ms. Ginger McCall, conducted work on this litigation prior to her admittance to the\n\nbar, the court applies the 'paralegal/clerk' Laffey rate to this time.\"). The Court will recalculate\n\ntheir fees with the $145 per hour rate applicable to Law Clerks under the Laffey matrix:\n\n       David R. Brody\n       Original request: 10.40 hours at $245 per hour = $2,548\n       As modified by the Court: 10.40 hours at $145 per hour = $1,508\n       Deduction: $2,548 - $1,508 = $1,040\n\n       Julia Horwitz\n       Original request: 12.70 15 hours at $245 per hour = $3,111.50\n       As modified by the Court: 12.70 hours at $145 per hour = $1,841.50\n       Deduction: $3,111.50 - $1,841.50 = $1,270\n\n       14\n          In this opinion, the Court discusses most, but not all of DHS's individual objections.\nFor those the Court does not discuss—primarily, a small handful of highly specific objections to\nindividual billing entries—the Court notes that it considered such objections and found them\nunpersuasive.\n       15\n          Horwitz billed additional hours after her admission to the bar. This time is not\nincluded in these 12.70 hours, but it will be considered below.\n\n                                                12\n\f       Jeramie D. Scott\n       Original request: 13.00 hours at $245 per hour = $3,185\n       As modified by the Court: 13.00 hours at $145 per hour = $1,885\n       Deduction: $3,185 - $1,885 = $1,300\n\nEPIC's fee award will be reduced accordingly.\n\n       This covers all of the time by attorneys Brody and Scott, 16 but Julia Horwitz also billed\n\ntime to this matter after her admission to the Maryland bar. See Pl.'s Bill of Litig. Fees and\n\nCosts, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Mot. for Att'y's Fees [Docket Entry 25-3] at 11 (1.30 hours in April 2013);\n\nEPIC Litigation Time Sheet, Attach. 1 to Pl.'s Reply [Docket Entry 27-1] at 3 (14.20 hours in\n\nMay 2013); see also Decl. of Jean-Michel Voltaire, Esq. [Docket Entry 26-4] at ¶ 10 (Horwitz\n\nadmitted to Maryland bar on December 12, 2012). Upon admission to the bar, categorizing Ms.\n\nHorwitz as a \"Law Clerk\" rather than an attorney would ignore the Court of Appeals of\n\nMaryland's determination that she is \"qualified to practice law and is of good moral character\"—\n\na hard-earned achievement that this Court will not overlook. See Rule 12, Rules Governing\n\nAdmission    to   the   Bar   of   Maryland,    available   at   http://www.courts.state.md.us/ble/\n\npdfs/baradmissionrules.pdf.\n\n       There is another problem. While \"Law Clerk\" would not be an appropriate title for an\n\nattorney admitted to practice law, it would also be inaccurate to categorize Ms. Horwitz as an\n\nattorney with \"1-3 years\" of legal experience, just five months after her bar admission and eleven\n\nmonths after her graduation from law school. 17 Ms. Horwitz's work on this case has exposed a\n\n       16\n           To be precise, Scott also worked on this case in April 2013, Pl.'s Bill of Litig. Fees and\nCosts, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Mot. for Att'y's Fees at 12 (0.10 hours on April 10, 2013), by which time he\nvery well may have been admitted to the bar. But because his affidavit does not provide an\nadmission date, and EPIC's reply brief does not offer any assistance (after being put on notice of\nthe issue in DHS's opposition), the Court will assume for purposes of deciding this motion that\nall of attorney Scott's time on this case was billed before he was admitted to the bar, including\nthe 0.10 hours in April 2013.\n        17\n           Horwitz graduated from law school on June 9, 2012. See Horwitz Aff. ¶ 4 (\"I am a\n2012 graduate of the University of Chicago Law School.\"); Remarks of Prof. R.H. Helmholz,\n\n                                                 13\n\fcurious flaw in the Laffey matrix: there is no category for an attorney who has been admitted to\n\npractice law but who has less than a full year of legal experience. See 2013 Laffey Matrix\n\n(showing $145 per hour rate for \"Paralegals & Law Clerks\" and $245 per hour rate for \"1-3\n\nyears\" of experience), available at http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/Laffey_Matrix\n\n_2003-2013.pdf. Accordingly, the Court, in its discretion, will split the difference, and award\n\nfees at an hourly rate of $195 per hour—halfway between the $145 per hour rate for Law Clerks\n\nand the $245 per hour rate for attorneys with 1-3 years of experience. Hence, the Court will\n\nrecalculate these fees as follows:\n\n       Julia Horwitz\n       Original request: 15.50 hours at $245 per hour = $3,797.50\n       As modified by the Court: 15.50 hours at $195 per hour = $3,022.50\n       Deduction: $3,797.50 - $3,022.50 = $775\n\nIn modifying these fees to account for Ms. Horwitz's bar status, the Court cannot fathom why the\n\nLaffey matrix should contain such an ambiguity. In preparing future versions of the Laffey\n\nmatrix, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia may wish to consider finding a\n\ncategory for admitted attorneys with less than a full year of legal work experience, or simply\n\nmodifying the \"1-3 years\" of experience category to read \"0-3 years\" of experience.\n\n               C. Sufficiency of EPIC's Billing Entries\n\n       DHS claims that EPIC's \"billing entries are too vague to allow the Court to assess their\n\nreasonableness,\" and are \"rife with inconsistencies and inaccuracies that call into question their\n\ncontemporaneousness.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 13. The Court agrees only in part.\n\n\n\n\n(showing 2012 graduation date for the University of Chicago Law School as June 9, 2012),\navailable at http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/fall12/graduation; see also Fed. R. of\nEvid. 201(b) (\"The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute\nbecause it . . . can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot\nreasonably be questioned.\").\n\n                                               14\n\f       The D.C. Circuit \"has been very explicit about what documentation is necessary to\n\nrecover attorneys fees.\" Weisberg v. Webster, 749 F.2d 864, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1984). To obtain a\n\nfee award, the movant must provide \"contemporaneous, complete and standardized time records\n\nwhich accurately reflect the work done by each attorney.\" Nat'l Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v.\n\nSec'y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \"Casual, after-the-fact estimates of time\n\nexpended on a case are insufficient to support an award of attorneys' fees.\" Id.\n\n       DHS offers a small handful of examples of alleged defects in EPIC's billing entries that\n\nsupposedly \"call into question their contemporaneousness.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 13. But none of\n\nthese examples are sufficiently troublesome that the Court would question the representations—\n\nin affidavits sworn under penalty of perjury—from each of EPIC's attorneys, stating that the\n\nrecords were accurately and contemporaneously recorded. See Butler Aff. ¶ 7; Stepanovich Aff.\n\n¶ 8; Brody Aff. ¶ 7; McCall Aff. ¶ 10; Scott Aff. ¶ 8; Horwitz Aff. ¶ 9; Rotenberg Aff. ¶ 9. DHS\n\npoints to a previous draft of EPIC's time submissions that contained an obvious error: time billed\n\nfor drafting a proposed scheduling order that had actually been filed two days earlier. Def.'s\n\nOpp'n at 13. But EPIC corrected this entry before filing their motion, and the Court has no\n\nreason to disbelieve EPIC's representation that this was nothing more than \"a simple typo.\" Pl.'s\n\nReply at 12.\n\n       DHS also questions the propriety of billing 2.30 hours \"in preparation of filing\n\ndocuments with its complaint, even though there was no attachment to the complaint.\" Def.'s\n\nOpp'n at 13. But EPIC persuasively responds that 2.30 hours was required to prepare the \"civil\n\ncover sheet, [Local Rule] 7.1 Statement, and summons to the agency, Attorney General, and the\n\nU.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia,\" in an era before e-filing—the attorney had to\n\n\"prepare each of these documents, scan them (because several documents had to be signed), burn\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fthem onto a CD, make several copies of each document, and then hand deliver them to the\n\nCourt.\" Pl.'s Reply at 13. The Court cannot say that 2.30 hours to complete these activities is\n\n\"unreasonable\" as a matter of law, nor does this entry cast any doubt on the general accuracy or\n\ncontemporaneousness of EPIC's billing records.\n\n        DHS also argues that some of the billing descriptions \"are so cryptic as to be meaningless\n\nand thus should be excluded.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 12. Examples of such entries—quoted here in\n\ntheir entirety—include \"'file,' 'conference,' 'research,' 'edit,' 'draft,' [and] 'review.'\" Id. The Court\n\nagrees wholeheartedly: these one-word entries are insufficient to support a fee award. EPIC\n\n\"offers no real excuse for its inadequate timekeeping habits,\" especially since it \"was aware it\n\nwould be seeking a fee award.\" Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 825\n\nF. Supp. 2d 226, 230 (D.D.C. 2011); see also Compl. at 8 (requesting \"costs and reasonable\n\nattorneys' fees incurred in this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)\").\n\n        Despite these problematic entries, the Court \"does not find a complete disallowance of\n\nfees to be warranted—the records here are not so deficient as to prevent opposing counsel or the\n\nCourt from 'mak[ing] an informed determination as to the merits of the application.'\" Citizens\n\nfor Responsibility & Ethics in Washington, 825 F. Supp. 2d at 231 (quoting Concerned Veterans,\n\n675 F.2d at 1327). Given the dates, and the surrounding context of other, more-detailed entries,\n\nit is possible to glean some useful information based on some of these bare-bones descriptions.\n\nHence, the Court will deduct 40% of this time from EPIC's fee award as a penalty for these\n\nshortcomings, and to incentivize future litigants to maintain sufficiently detailed billing entries.\n\nSee Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (\"Where the documentation of hours is\n\ninadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.\"); Citizens for Responsibility &\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fEthics in Washington, 825 F.

Overstaffing and Overbilling\n\n        DHS argues that \"EPIC seeks compensation for patently unnecessary and duplicative\n\nefforts, billing for work performed by 7 attorneys in this garden-variety FOIA case where the\n\ngovernment is represented by a single attorney.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 14. The Court finds this\n\nobjection to be conclusory and unpersuasive. At the outset, the Court notes that EPIC's fee\n\nrequest of $37,197.75 is comparable in size to amounts that have been recently awarded in\n\nsimilar cases in this district. See, e.g., EPIC v. DHS, 811 F. Supp. 2d 216, 241 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(awarding $21,482 in FOIA action resolved on summary judgment); Judicial Watch II, 774 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 234 (awarding $26,601.25 in FOIA action resolved on summary judgment, noting\n\n        18\n           Some of these time entries originally requested payment at $245 per hour, but as\ndiscussed above, the Court has reduced the hourly rate to $145 per hour due to the bar admission\nstatus of the attorneys in question. See supra, Section IV.B.\n\n                                                   17\n\fthat \"DOJ has neither suggested nor provided support for a conclusion that Judicial Watch's\n\noverall effort expended or requested lodestar amount are unusual for a FOIA case in this district\n\nor of similar complexity\").\n\n         DHS's more specific objections fare no better.     The Court is not moved by DHS's\n\nunsupported assertion that \"[a]ttorneys ordinarily do not charge their clients fees for time spent\n\non internal meetings because they are often not the most productive use of time and have little\n\nrelevance resolving the case.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 15. Even if DHS were correct, EPIC is not\n\nconstrained to billing only for tasks that are the \"most productive\" uses of their time. DHS is\n\nright that \"[a]n attorney is charged with utilizing billing judgment when charging for his\n\nservices,\" id. at 16, \"[b]ut billing judgment is just that—judgment,\" Judicial Watch II, 774 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 232. EPIC's judgment to include time spent on internal conferences on their time\n\nsheets is not such a departure from the norm as to rebut the presumption of reasonableness\n\nafforded to a lodestar calculated from the Laffey matrix. See Baker v. D.C. Pub. Schs., 815 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 102, 107-08 (D.D.C. 2011) (plaintiff's properly documented lodestar is presumed\n\nreasonable).\n\n         Similarly, the Court refuses to nitpick \"a charge of 8.5 hours ($2,040)\" for what DHS\n\ncalled \"a 9-page boilerplate complaint for this simple, straightforward FOIA case.\" Def.'s Opp'n\n\nat 16.    If FOIA's statutory requirements as applied to this case were so \"simple\" and\n\n\"straightforward,\" DHS might have been better served by complying with them—rather than by\n\nignoring statutory deadlines and meeting their legal obligations only upon being served with a\n\ncomplaint in federal court. See Homeland Security Hr'g (statement of Rep. Speier, Ranking\n\nMember) (\"They made a FOIA request back in April. DHS ignored it. And then EPIC filed a\n\nlawsuit . . . when the agency failed to comply with the FOIA deadlines. And as a result of filing\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fthe lawsuit, DHS disclosed to EPIC 285 pages of documents. . . . [Y]ou shouldn't stonewall\n\nFOIA requests.

IRS, 559 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1055, 1061 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (\"Reminding the Court of the waste of resources\n\nengendered by Defendant's failure to comply with its obligations hardly persuades the Court to\n\nreduce the fee award.\").\n\n       Finally, DHS argues that \"EPIC should not receive any fees for reviewing documents\n\nproduced in response to its FOIA request.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 20 (citing Citizens for Responsibility\n\n& Ethics in Washington, 825 F. Supp. 2d at 231 (\"Plaintiff is not entitled to recover for time\n\nspent reviewing the documents it instituted this lawsuit to obtain.\")). The Court disagrees. \"[I]t\n\nwould seem critical to the prosecution of a FOIA lawsuit for a plaintiff to review an agency's\n\ndisclosure for sufficiency and proper withholding during the course of its FOIA litigation.\"\n\nEPIC, 811 F. Supp. 2d at 239-40. True, \"FOIA does not authorize fees for work performed at the\n\nadministrative stage,\" Nw. Coal. for Alternatives to Pesticides v. Browner, 965 F. Supp. 59, 65\n\n(D.D.C. 1997)—which frequently includes time spent reviewing documents. Nor should fees be\n\nawarded for time expended in using documents produced. But EPIC is only seeking fees for\n\nreview of documents produced during this litigation, and DHS \"has failed to provide any\n\nevidence that this time billed by Plaintiff's attorneys was not spent for the purpose of litigating\n\nthis case.\" Rosenfeld v. DOJ, 904 F. Supp. 2d 988, 1005 (N.D. Cal. 2012). Accordingly, the\n\nCourt finds that EPIC is entitled to fees generated during this work.\n\n               E. Fees Arising out of Issues on Which EPIC Did Not Prevail\n\n       Finally, DHS argues that EPIC improperly seeks fees for all of its work on this case,\n\nrather than solely with respect to issues on which they prevailed. As the U.S. Supreme Court has\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fheld, \"[w]here the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his\n\nsuccessful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering\n\nthe amount of a reasonable fee.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440. But \"[w]here a lawsuit consists of\n\nrelated claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee\n\nreduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised.\" Id.\n\n       At the outset, the Court notes that DHS conflates the \"prevailing party\" analysis under\n\nHensley—which instructs a district court to consider whether partial defeats suffered by the\n\nplaintiff are severable for purposes of awarding fees—with the \"public benefit\" standard for\n\noverall \"entitlement\" to a fee award. See Def.'s Opp'n at 8 (\"[N]ot only is EPIC not a 'prevailing\n\nparty' on that issue, it cannot demonstrate any 'public benefit' resulting from this release that\n\nwould make it entitled to attorneys' fees.\"). Hence, the fact that \"[a]ll of the references to news\n\narticles cited in EPIC's brief occurred prior the release of the\" Secret Service documents—and\n\nthus, the fact that a \"public benefit\" may not have accrued as a result of the disclosure of those\n\nspecific documents—does not mean that EPIC cannot recover fees for this work. Instead, the\n\nCourt must consider whether, under Hensley, the losses EPIC suffered in this litigation were\n\n\"distinct in all respects\" from their victories, or, instead, were sufficiently \"related\" such that its\n\nfee award should not be reduced.\n\n       Having \"considered the relationship between the amount of the fee [requested] and the\n\nresults obtained,\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, the Court finds that EPIC's limited defeats in this\n\ncase are insufficient to justify a significant reduction in EPIC's fee award. EPIC suffered only\n\ntwo \"defeats\" in this litigation. First, the Court ruled against EPIC with respect to one of the\n\nseven Secret Service documents at issue during the summary judgment briefing. But EPIC's\n\nwork on this case cannot be thinly sliced on a document-by-document basis. The controversy\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fover each individual document was not just \"related\" to the others—it was entirely overlapping.\n\nAny work that EPIC did in arguing for the release of document 10 would also have assisted it in\n\nits argument to release documents 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16. See, e.g., Pl.'s MSJ at 12 (\"With\n\nrespect to the above-mentioned documents, USSS failed to provide the required detailed\n\njustification to withhold non-exempt material as non-segregable.\") (emphasis added); Def.'s\n\nReply and Opp'n at 7 (\"The challenged documents are numbered 4-6, 10, 12, 13, and 16, and\n\nconsist of mostly contracts. . . . They are withheld in full pursuant to several FOIA exemptions.\n\nThe USSS has conducted a detailed segregability analysis of these documents and concluded that\n\nthey cannot be segregated.\") (emphasis added). In Hensley the Supreme Court explained that\n\n\"[w]here a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not\n\nhave his attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention\n\nraised.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440; see also Action on Smoking & Health v. Civil Aeronautics\n\nBd., 724 F.2d 211, 215-16 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (distinguishing Hensley and refusing to sever fee\n\naward, finding that \"the entire litigation centered on a set of common issues,\" various claims\n\n\"involved a common core of facts and were based on related legal theories,\" and all claims were\n\n\"part and parcel of a single matter\") (internal quotation marks omitted). So too here. EPIC's\n\nsummary judgment defeat with respect to one of the seven Secret Service documents does not\n\nwarrant an excision of its fees for this work—assuming such an act of judicial microsurgery was\n\neven possible.\n\n       EPIC's second \"defeat\" was its opposition to DHS's motion for an extension of time to\n\nfile its reply and opposition to plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment. EPIC refused to\n\nconsent to DHS's motion, and filed a six-page opposition brief. Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for\n\nExtension [Docket Entry 19]. The Court granted the extension. Oct. 4, 2012 Minute Order. In\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fcontrast to arguments over individual Secret Service documents, any time spent on this briefing\n\nwas completely \"divorced from [and] unrelated to [EPIC's] principal FOIA claim.\" Judicial\n\nWatch I, 470 F.3d at 370. This time was devoted solely to a losing issue. The Court also notes\n\nthat consent to such a motion, when the extension is sought in good faith, is generally considered\n\na matter of professional courtesy. Thus, the Court will modify EPIC's fee award to eliminate\n\nhours devoted to this issue:\n\n       Opposition to Motion for an Extension\n       Oct. 2, 2012: Attorney Rotenberg – 0.40 hours at $505 per hour = $202\n       Oct. 2, 2012: Attorney McCall – 0.20 hours at $245 per hour = $49\n\n       Total requested for work on unsuccessful opposition to motion for extension: $251\n       Deduction: 100% of $251 = $251\n\nEPIC's fee award will be reduced accordingly.\n\n       DHS also argues that \"to the extent that the Court agrees with defendant that many or\n\nmost of EPIC's fee demands are unwarranted or unsupported, the amount of 'fees on fees' should\n\nbe reduced accordingly.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 19. The Supreme Court has approved reduction of\n\npartially unsuccessful fee applications to more appropriately reflect a plaintiff's success. See INS\n\nv. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 163 n.10 (1990). Here, while EPIC has successfully defended most of its\n\nrequested fees, the Court has partially rejected their application as well. The Court is hesitant to\n\ngo too deeply down this path, for fear of \"spawn[ing] a Kafkaesque judicial nightmare of infinite\n\nlitigation to recover fees for the last round of litigation over fees.\" Id. at 163 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Therefore, in the interests of justice and judicial economy, the Court will\n\nexercise its discretion to make an across-the-board 15% reduction of EPIC's requested award of\n\n\"fees on fees.\" The 15% reduction accounts for EPIC's substantial success on its fee motion, but\n\nalso the shortcomings of the petition—for example, the excessively vague billing entries and the\n\nimproper hourly rates charged to recent law school graduates:\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f        \"Fees on Fees\" Requested 19\n        Attorney Stepanovich: $269.50\n        Attorney Rotenberg: $1,514.50\n        Attorney McCall: $3,993.50\n        Attorney Horwitz: $3,797.50\n        Attorney Butler: $24.50\n        Attorney Jacobs: $24.50\n        Attorney Scott: $24.50\n        Original request for \"fees on fees\": $9,648.50\n        Deduction for partial defeat in fee litigation: 15% of $9,648.50 = $1,447.28\n\nEPIC's fee award will be reduced accordingly.\n\n   V.        DHS's motion to strike will be denied.\n\n        Lastly, the Court must address DHS's motion to strike certain paragraphs of EPIC's reply\n\nbrief, as well as some of the exhibits attached to that brief. DHS argues that EPIC improperly\n\ndisclosed settlement communications in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 408. The Court\n\nnotes that the existence of settlement discussions was no secret—this Court ordered the parties to\n\n\"confer and attempt to reach an agreement on fee issues.\" Mar. 4, 2013 Order. And DHS's\n\nopposition brief was the first to reference substantively the parties' settlement talks, arguing that\n\nEPIC was not entitled to \"fees on fees\" in part because \"defendant made two settlement offers\"\n\nthat EPIC rejected. Def.'s Opp'n at 18. DHS objects not just that EPIC disclosed the existence of\n\nsettlement discussions, but also the amount of DHS's settlement offers, \"in an attempt . . . to\n\ninfluence the Court's resolution of its fee petition in its favor.\" Def.'s Mot. to Strike [Docket\n\nEntry 28] at 3; see also id. (\"In violation of Rule 408, EPIC revealed to the Court that Defendant\n\nhad offered greater amounts in settlement in an obvious effort to substantiate the validity and the\n\namount of its fee petition.\").\n\n\n\n\n        19\n         The Court notes that some portion of this amount has already been deducted due to the\nbar admission status of the attorneys in question. See supra, Section IV.B. In its discretion, the\nCourt will use the entire original request to calculate this deduction.\n\n                                                 23\n\f       At the outset, it is not clear that the Federal Rules authorize this Court to strike a portion\n\nof a reply brief in support of a motion for attorney's fees. Motions to strike are typically filed\n\nunder Federal Civil Rule 12(f), which allows a district court to \"strike from a pleading an\n\ninsufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Henok v.\n\nChase Home Fin., LLC, 925 F. Supp. 2d 46, 52 (D.D.C. 2013). At least one court in this district\n\nhas pointed out that \"Rule 7(a) lists the filings that constitute pleadings, but 'motions, affidavits,\n\nbriefs and other documents are outside of the pleadings,'\" and thus \"are not subject to being\n\nstricken.\" Id. at 52-53 (quoting 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure § 1380 (3d ed. supp. 2012)); see also Michaels v. City of Vermilion, No. 05-2991,\n\n2007 WL 893185, at *2 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 22, 2007) (\"[W]hile some courts have employed Rule\n\n12(f) to strike items such as an affidavit or a brief, or portions thereof, there is no basis in the\n\nFederal Rules for doing so.\"). To be sure, some authority from outside the D.C. Circuit tends to\n\nsupport the opposite conclusion, reasoning that a district court's inherent power to manage its\n\ndocket includes this authority. See, e.g., Ready Transp., Inc. v. AAR Mfg., Inc., 627 F.3d 402,\n\n404 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"We conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction to grant the motion to\n\nstrike pursuant to its inherent powers.\").\n\n       But the Court need not resolve this question, because even assuming that the Court has\n\nthis power, it would not choose it exercise it here. While the Court \"has broad discretion in\n\nruling on a motion to strike,\" this is a \"drastic remedy,\" so \"motions to strike are disfavored.\"\n\nUzlyan v. Solis, 706 F. Supp. 2d 44, 51 (D.D.C. 2010). For three reasons, the Court will not\n\nexercise its discretion to take this \"drastic\" and \"disfavored\" step. First, the Court need not—and\n\ndid not—rely on the settlement figures included by EPIC in resolving this motion. See Ali v.\n\nDist. of Columbia Gov't, 810 F. Supp. 2d 78, 84 n.5 (D.D.C. 2011) (\"[T]he Court makes no use\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fof some of the documents to which the District objects, and thus does not address their\n\nadmissibility.\"). The fact that DHS offered to settle this dispute for an amount higher than they\n\nnow argue EPIC is entitled to is neither surprising nor relevant to the Court's decision. Second,\n\nthe courts in this circuit have refused to recognize a \"federal settlement privilege,\" in re\n\nSubpoena Issued to CFTC, 370 F. Supp. 2d 201, 212 (D.D.C. 2005), aff'd in part on other\n\ngrounds, 439 F.3d 740 (D.C. Cir. 2006), so DHS's interest in removing these paragraphs from the\n\npublic docket is less compelling than, say, improper disclosure of information protected by the\n\nattorney-client privilege. That is so even assuming that the settlement offers would have been\n\ninadmissible at trial—a question the Court does not decide. Third, it was DHS that made the\n\nfirst substantive argument based on the parties' failed settlement negotiations in their own\n\nopposition brief. Def.'s Opp'n at 18. Striking EPIC's response to those arguments potentially\n\nraises some fairness concerns. Cf. Koch v. Cox, 489 F.3d 384, 390 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"The\n\nprohibition against selective disclosure of confidential materials derives from the appropriate\n\nconcern that parties do not employ privileges both as a sword and as a shield.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Hence, in exercising its discretion, the Court will deny\n\nDHS's motion to strike.\n\n                                        *       *      *\n\n       The Court's conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n\n       Final Fee Calculations\n       EPIC's original request: $36,847.75 in fees, $350 in costs\n\n       Deductions by the Court:\n             $1,040 for hourly rate of attorney Brody\n             $1,270 for hourly rate of attorney Horwitz (before bar admission)\n             $1,300 for hourly rate of attorney Scott\n             $775 for hourly rate of attorney Horwitz (after bar admission)\n             $922.80 for vague billing entries\n             $251 for failed opposition to motion for an extension\n\n\n                                               25\n\f              $1,447.28 for partial defeat in fee litigation\n\n              Total deduction: $7,006.08\n\n       Final award: $29,841.67 in fees, $350 in costs.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, EPIC's motion for attorney's fees will be granted in part and\n\ndenied in part; DHS will be ordered to pay $29,841.67 in attorney's fees, and $350.00 in costs.\n\nDHS's motion to strike will be denied.

Before the Court is [25] EPIC's motion for attorney's fees, and [28]\n\nDHS's motion to strike a portion of [27] EPIC's reply brief in support of its fee motion. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, EPIC's motion for attorney's fees will be granted in part and denied in\n\npart, and DHS's motion to strike will be denied.\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       On February 1, 2011, DHS published notice in the Federal Register announcing its intent\n\nto create a new system to monitor social media networks, titled \"Publicly Available Social Media\n\nMonitoring and Situational Awareness Initiatives.\" Compl. [Docket Entry 1] ¶ 5; see also 76\n\nFed. Reg. 5603, No. DHS-2011-0003 (Feb. 1, 2011). The program was designed to monitor\n\n\"publicly available online forums, blogs, public websites, and message boards,\" and \"disseminate\n\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\frelevant and appropriate de-identified information to federal, state, local, and foreign\n\ngovernments, and private sector partners.\" 76 Fed. Reg. at 5603.\n\n       EPIC filed a FOIA request \"[i]n order to allow the public to assess the privacy risks to\n\nsocial media users, on April 12, 2011.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Att'y's Fees [Docket Entry 25] at 3. Eight\n\nmonths later, DHS had not produced any documents. Compl. ¶ 27. Hence, EPIC filed this\n\nlawsuit, seeking an injunction to compel DHS to comply with FOIA. Id. ¶ 38. DHS began\n\nproducing responsive documents three weeks later. Over the next year, DHS made rolling\n\nproductions, totaling approximately five hundred pages of documents, some of which were\n\npartially redacted. See Decl. of James Holzer, Attach. 3 to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Docket\n\nEntry 12-3] ¶¶ 15-17; Decl. of Julie Ferrell (\"Ferrell Decl.\"), Attach. 5 to Def.'s Mot. for Summ.\n\nJ. [Docket Entry 12-5] ¶¶ 26-29. DHS also withheld 230 responsive documents under various\n\nFOIA exemptions. Ferrell Decl. ¶ 29.\n\n       DHS then moved for summary judgment, arguing that it had adequately searched for and\n\nproduced all responsive, nonexempt records. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Docket Entry 12] at 8.\n\nEPIC filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, making two objections to DHS's efforts to\n\ncomply with their FOIA request: (1) that DHS's Vaughn index was insufficient, and (2) that DHS\n\nshould have produced in redacted form seven documents from the Secret Service that had been\n\nwithheld in their entirety (\"the Secret Service documents\"). Pl.'s Opp'n & Cross Mot. for Summ.\n\nJ. (\"Pl.'s MSJ\") [Docket Entry 16] at 1. EPIC also requested attorney's fees and costs. Id. at 14.\n\n       DHS disputed both of EPIC's arguments, and asked the Court to defer ruling on EPIC's\n\nrequest for attorney's fees. Def.'s Reply & Opp'n [Docket Entry 20] at 1-2. But despite arguing\n\nfor several pages that their original Vaughn index was proper, DHS attached an updated, more-\n\nspecific Vaughn index. See Updated Vaughn Index (Oct. 26, 2012), Attach. 1 to Def.'s Reply &\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fOpp'n [Docket Entry 20-1]. In doing so, DHS maintained its position that \"the original Index\n\nwas sufficient,\" but admitted that it \"could be made more clear.\" Def.'s Reply & Opp'n at 6.\n\nSatisfied with the updated version, EPIC then withdrew its objections to DHS's Vaughn index,\n\nwhile continuing to press its objections to DHS's withholding of the Secret Service documents,\n\nand renewing its request for attorney's fees and costs. Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. [Docket Entry 22] at 1-2.\n\n       This Court granted in part and denied in part both parties' motions for summary\n\njudgment. See Mar. 4, 2013 Mem. Op. [Docket Entry 23]. The Court ordered DHS to produce\n\nsix of the seven Secret Service documents in redacted form, but found that one of the seven had\n\nbeen properly withheld in full, finding that the non-exempt portions were not reasonably\n\nsegregable. See id.; see also Mar. 4, 2013 Order [Docket Entry 24]. The Court did not rule on\n\nEPIC's request for attorney's fees, and instead ordered \"that, pursuant to Local Civil Rule 54.2(a),\n\nthe parties shall confer and attempt to reach an agreement on fee issues.\" Mar. 4, 2013 Order.\n\nAlthough the Court was \"not deciding the issue\" at that time, \"it note[d], in the hope of guiding\n\nthe parties' discussions, that EPIC will be entitled to some amount of fees and costs, given the\n\nagency's release of responsive documents, the Vaughn index revisions, and the Court's resolution\n\nof the instant motions.\" Mar. 4, 2013 Mem. Op. at 9.\n\n       The Court's optimism for an agreement on fees and costs proved unfounded—EPIC filed\n\nits motion for attorney's fees the following month. In its opposition brief, DHS made reference\n\nto a settlement offer that EPIC had rejected. See Def.'s Opp'n to Mot. for Att'y's Fees (\"Def.'s\n\nOpp'n\") [Docket Entry 26] at 18. In its reply, EPIC actually included the relevant settlement\n\ncommunication, revealing to the Court (and anyone monitoring the public docket) the amount for\n\nwhich DHS had offered to settle the fee issue. See Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Mot. for\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fAtt'y's Fees (\"Pl.'s Reply\") [Docket Entry 27-2]. Three days later, DHS filed a motion to strike\n\nthe portions of EPIC's reply brief referencing the settlement offer, citing the bar in Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 408 to the admissibility of settlement communications \"to prove or disprove the\n\nvalidity or amount of a disputed claim.\" Fed. R. Evid. 408(a).\n\n                                     LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       The Freedom of Information Act provides that courts \"may assess against the United\n\nStates reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case . . . in\n\nwhich the complainant has substantially prevailed.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(i). This statutory\n\nlanguage \"naturally divides the attorney-fee inquiry into two prongs,\" which the D.C. Circuit\n\n\"has long described as fee 'eligibility' and fee 'entitlement.'\" Brayton v.

The parties vigorously dispute the amount of fees, however, with EPIC\n\nrequesting $37,197.75 in fees and costs, and DHS proposing a meager $1,992.50. DHS offers a\n\nvariety of objections to EPIC's proposal.      Some have merit; others do not.        After briefly\n\nanalyzing the questions of \"eligibility\" and \"entitlement,\" the Court will consider each objection\n\nin turn. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that EPIC is entitled to most, but not all\n\nof the fees it has requested, and will order a total award of $29,841.67 in attorney's fees and $350\n\nin costs.\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f    I.        EPIC is eligible for attorney's fees.\n\n         EPIC is eligible for attorney's fees, because it has \"substantially prevailed\" within the\n\nmeaning of FOIA. There are two ways to satisfy the \"substantially prevailed\" requirement under\n\nFOIA, and EPIC meets both. First, EPIC \"obtained relief through . . . a judicial order.\" 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)(I). Faced with cross-motions for summary judgment, this Court granted in\n\npart and denied in part both parties' motions. See Mar. 4, 2013 Mem. Op. at 9-10. But EPIC\n\nobtained nearly all of the relief it was seeking, as the Court ordered DHS to produce all\n\nreasonably segregable portions of six of the seven documents that remained in dispute. Id. True,\n\nthis Court denied EPIC's motion with respect to one of the seven Secret Service documents, but a\n\nFOIA requester can still \"substantially prevail\" even when it obtains less-than-full relief. See,\n\ne.g., Judicial Watch I, 470 F.3d at 371 (FOIA requester awarded fees after a partial litigation\n\nvictory). 1\n\n         EPIC's advocacy also caused \"a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency,\"\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)(II). After producing nothing in response to EPIC's FOIA request for\n\napproximately eight months, DHS released hundreds of responsive documents within three\n\nweeks of receiving EPIC's complaint in this action. Similarly, DHS produced a revised Vaughn\n\nindex meeting EPIC's proposed specifications, after EPIC took issue with DHS's first attempt. 2\n\nThese tangible successes further support the common-sense notion that EPIC has \"substantially\n\nprevailed\" in this matter. See, e.g., Brayton, 641 F.3d at 525 (\"[P]laintiffs can now qualify as\n\n'substantially prevailing,' and thus become eligible for attorney fees, without winning court-\n\nordered relief on the merits of their FOIA claims.\"). Presumably for these reasons, DHS does\n\n         1\n           Whether EPIC is entitled to all of its fees for work on issues for which it did not prevail\nis a different question, which the Court will consider in further detail infra, Section IV.E.\n         2\n           DHS does not argue that EPIC's Vaughn index objections were \"insubstantial,\" 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(a)(4)(E)(ii)(II), so the Court will not consider the argument.\n\n                                                  6\n\fnot meaningfully dispute that EPIC is eligible for fees as a prevailing party under FOIA. See\n\ngenerally Def.'s Opp'n.\n\n   II.       EPIC is entitled to attorney's fees.\n\n         Next, the Court applies the D.C. Circuit's four-factor test to determine whether EPIC is\n\nentitled to fees. The Court must consider: \"(1) the public benefit derived from the case, (2) the\n\ncommercial benefit to the requester, (3) the nature of the requester's interest in the information,\n\nand (4) the reasonableness of the agency's conduct.\" Morley, 719 F.3d at 690.\n\n         The \"public benefit\" factor \"requires consideration of both the effect of the litigation for\n\nwhich fees are requested and the potential public value of the information sought.\" Davy, 550\n\nF.3d at 1159. As FOIA requests go, the public benefit derived from this one was exceptional.\n\nEPIC obtained and disclosed documents relating to a matter subject to an ongoing national\n\ndebate: the tension between individual privacy interests and the national-security needs of our\n\ngovernment in the digital age. Regardless of one's views on the merits, there is no doubt that\n\nEPIC's FOIA request made a contribution to this national conversation. Documents obtained\n\nthrough the request were analyzed in the Washington Post.             See Ellen Nakashima, DHS\n\nMonitoring of Social Media Concerns Civil Liberties Advocates, The Washington Post, Jan. 13,\n\n2012 (\"[M]onitoring for 'positive and negative reports' on U.S. agencies falls outside the\n\ndepartment's mission to 'secure the nation,' said the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which\n\nobtained a copy of a contract and related material describing DHS's social media monitoring\n\nthrough its FOIA suit.\"). 3 And EPIC's FOIA work on this matter was discussed by several other\n\nprominent media outlets. See, e.g., Privacy Group Sues DHS Over Social Media Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n         3\n        Available at http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-01-13/world/35441734_1_social-\nmedia-dhs-documents-reports\n\n                                                    7\n\fProgram, FOXNews.com, Dec. 24, 2011; 4 Liz Klimas, Which Keywords on Twitter Get the\n\nGovernment's Attention?, The Blaze, Dec. 28, 2011; 5 Mark Hosenball, Homeland Security\n\nWatches Twitter, Social Media, Reuters, Jan. 11, 2012; 6 Jaikumar Vijayan, DHS Media\n\nMonitoring Could Chill Public Dissent, EPIC Warns, Computer World, Jan. 16, 2012; 7 Mark\n\nRockwell, DHS Social Media Monitoring Practices Revealed Under FOIA, Government Security\n\nNews, May 29, 2012; 8 Robert N.

This is the sort of public\n\nbenefit that FOIA was designed to promote.\n\n       Next, \"[t]he second and third factors, which are often considered together, assess whether\n\na plaintiff has 'sufficient private incentive to seek disclosure' without attorney's fees.\" Davy, 550\n\nF.3d at 1160 (quoting Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1095). \"The second factor considers the\n\ncommercial benefit to the plaintiff, while the third factor considers the plaintiff's interest in the\n\nrecords.\" Id. These factors also favor non-profit organizations like EPIC, which \"aim to ferret\n\nout and make public worthwhile, previously unknown government information—precisely the\n\nactivity that FOIA's fees provision seeks to promote.\" Id. As the D.C. Circuit has explained,\n\nthose \"requesters who seek documents for public informational purposes\" are favored by FOIA,\n\nand they \"engage in the kind of endeavor for which a public subsidy makes some sense.\" Id.\n\nAnd even if some private benefit accrued to EPIC by means of their success, \"Congress did not\n\nintend for scholars (or journalists and public interest groups) to forego compensation when\n\nacting within the scope of their professional roles.\" Campbell v.

Hence, the second and third factors also favor EPIC.\n\n       Finally, the fourth factor, \"the reasonableness of the agency's conduct,\" does not strongly\n\nweigh in favor of either party.        True, the Court held that DHS violated its statutory\n\nresponsibilities in responding to EPIC's FOIA request—but that will be true in any FOIA case in\n\nwhich the plaintiff obtains court-ordered relief. DHS also produced a revised Vaughn index\n\nupon receiving plaintiff's objections, obviating the need for a judicial determination on that issue.\n\nDHS's conduct—while no doubt falling short of FOIA's requirements—was not egregiously\n\nunreasonable. Hence, the fourth factor is more or less neutral in this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f          Considering all four factors together, the Court finds that EPIC is not just \"eligible,\" but\n\nis also \"entitled\" to attorney's fees under FOIA's fee-shifting provision.            DHS essentially\n\nconcedes as much in its opposition brief, which focuses on the amount of fees to be awarded.\n\nSee Def.'s Opp'n at 1 (\"While we do not dispute that EPIC is entitled to some fees in proportion\n\nto its minimal success, its request of $30,590.75 is unreasonably excessive and wholly\n\nunsupported.\").\n\n   III.         EPIC is entitled to \"fees on fees.\"\n\n          EPIC asks not only for attorney's fees for the underlying litigation, but also for its work in\n\nlitigating this fee motion—that is, \"fees on fees.\" 12 DHS opposes this request, primarily on the\n\ngrounds that EPIC \"vexatiously imposed unnecessary burdens on defendant and the Court\" by\n\nrejecting DHS's settlement offers, and by refusing to consent to an extension of time to continue\n\nsettlement negotiations. See Def.'s Opp'n at 18-19.\n\n          As EPIC argues—and DHS does not appear to dispute—\"[i]t 'is settled in this circuit' that\n\n'hours reasonably devoted to a request for fees are compensable.'\" Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

EPIC billed these attorneys at a rate of $245 per hour, which corresponds to the Laffey\n\nrate for attorneys with \"1-3 years\" of legal experience.

Hence, they are more properly\n\ncategorized under the heading \"Paralegals & Law Clerks,\" based upon their bar status during the\n\nrelevant time period, and the fact that they had not yet achieved \"1-3 years\" of legal experience.\n\nSee EPIC, 811 F.

While \"Law Clerk\" would not be an appropriate title for an\n\nattorney admitted to practice law, it would also be inaccurate to categorize Ms. Horwitz as an\n\nattorney with \"1-3 years\" of legal experience, just five months after her bar admission and eleven\n\nmonths after her graduation from law school. 17 Ms. Horwitz's work on this case has exposed a\n\n       16\n           To be precise, Scott also worked on this case in April 2013, Pl.'s Bill of Litig.

But because his affidavit does not provide an\nadmission date, and EPIC's reply brief does not offer any assistance (after being put on notice of\nthe issue in DHS's opposition), the Court will assume for purposes of deciding this motion that\nall of attorney Scott's time on this case was billed before he was admitted to the bar, including\nthe 0.10 hours in April 2013.\n        17\n           Horwitz graduated from law school on June 9, 2012.

Helmholz,\n\n                                                 13\n\fcurious flaw in the Laffey matrix: there is no category for an attorney who has been admitted to\n\npractice law but who has less than a full year of legal experience. See 2013 Laffey Matrix\n\n(showing $145 per hour rate for \"Paralegals & Law Clerks\" and $245 per hour rate for \"1-3\n\nyears\" of experience), available at http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/Laffey_Matrix\n\n_2003-2013.pdf. Accordingly, the Court, in its discretion, will split the difference, and award\n\nfees at an hourly rate of $195 per hour—halfway between the $145 per hour rate for Law Clerks\n\nand the $245 per hour rate for attorneys with 1-3 years of experience. Hence, the Court will\n\nrecalculate these fees as follows:\n\n       Julia Horwitz\n       Original request: 15.50 hours at $245 per hour = $3,797.50\n       As modified by the Court: 15.50 hours at $195 per hour = $3,022.50\n       Deduction: $3,797.50 - $3,022.50 = $775\n\nIn modifying these fees to account for Ms. Horwitz's bar status, the Court cannot fathom why the\n\nLaffey matrix should contain such an ambiguity. In preparing future versions of the Laffey\n\nmatrix, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia may wish to consider finding a\n\ncategory for admitted attorneys with less than a full year of legal work experience, or simply\n\nmodifying the \"1-3 years\" of experience category to read \"0-3 years\" of experience.\n\n               C. Sufficiency of EPIC's Billing Entries\n\n       DHS claims that EPIC's \"billing entries are too vague to allow the Court to assess their\n\nreasonableness,\" and are \"rife with inconsistencies and inaccuracies that call into question their\n\ncontemporaneousness.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 13.

But none of\n\nthese examples are sufficiently troublesome that the Court would question the representations—\n\nin affidavits sworn under penalty of perjury—from each of EPIC's attorneys, stating that the\n\nrecords were accurately and contemporaneously recorded. See Butler Aff. ¶ 7; Stepanovich Aff.\n\n¶ 8; Brody Aff. ¶ 7; McCall Aff. ¶ 10; Scott Aff. ¶ 8; Horwitz Aff. ¶ 9; Rotenberg Aff. ¶ 9. DHS\n\npoints to a previous draft of EPIC's time submissions that contained an obvious error: time billed\n\nfor drafting a proposed scheduling order that had actually been filed two days earlier. Def.'s\n\nOpp'n at 13. But EPIC corrected this entry before filing their motion, and the Court has no\n\nreason to disbelieve EPIC's representation that this was nothing more than \"a simple typo.\" Pl.'s\n\nReply at 12.\n\n       DHS also questions the propriety of billing 2.30 hours \"in preparation of filing\n\ndocuments with its complaint, even though there was no attachment to the complaint.\" Def.'s\n\nOpp'n at 13. But EPIC persuasively responds that 2.30 hours was required to prepare the \"civil\n\ncover sheet, [Local Rule] 7.1 Statement, and summons to the agency, Attorney General, and the\n\nU.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia,\" in an era before e-filing—the attorney had to\n\n\"prepare each of these documents, scan them (because several documents had to be signed), burn\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fthem onto a CD, make several copies of each document, and then hand deliver them to the\n\nCourt.\" Pl.'s Reply at 13. The Court cannot say that 2.30 hours to complete these activities is\n\n\"unreasonable\" as a matter of law, nor does this entry cast any doubt on the general accuracy or\n\ncontemporaneousness of EPIC's billing records.\n\n        DHS also argues that some of the billing descriptions \"are so cryptic as to be meaningless\n\nand thus should be excluded.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 12. Examples of such entries—quoted here in\n\ntheir entirety—include \"'file,' 'conference,' 'research,' 'edit,' 'draft,' [and] 'review.'\" Id. The Court\n\nagrees wholeheartedly: these one-word entries are insufficient to support a fee award.

The Court finds this\n\nobjection to be conclusory and unpersuasive. At the outset, the Court notes that EPIC's fee\n\nrequest of $37,197.75 is comparable in size to amounts that have been recently awarded in\n\nsimilar cases in this district. See, e.g., EPIC v.

The Court is not moved by DHS's\n\nunsupported assertion that \"[a]ttorneys ordinarily do not charge their clients fees for time spent\n\non internal meetings because they are often not the most productive use of time and have little\n\nrelevance resolving the case.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 15.

EPIC's judgment to include time spent on internal conferences on their time\n\nsheets is not such a departure from the norm as to rebut the presumption of reasonableness\n\nafforded to a lodestar calculated from the Laffey matrix. See Baker v. D.C. Pub.

If FOIA's statutory requirements as applied to this case were so \"simple\" and\n\n\"straightforward,\" DHS might have been better served by complying with them—rather than by\n\nignoring statutory deadlines and meeting their legal obligations only upon being served with a\n\ncomplaint in federal court. See Homeland Security Hr'g (statement of Rep. Speier, Ranking\n\nMember) (\"They made a FOIA request back in April. DHS ignored it.

Fees Arising out of Issues on Which EPIC Did Not Prevail\n\n       Finally, DHS argues that EPIC improperly seeks fees for all of its work on this case,\n\nrather than solely with respect to issues on which they prevailed. As the U.S. Supreme Court has\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fheld, \"[w]here the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his\n\nsuccessful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering\n\nthe amount of a reasonable fee.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440. But \"[w]here a lawsuit consists of\n\nrelated claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee\n\nreduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised.\" Id.\n\n       At the outset, the Court notes that DHS conflates the \"prevailing party\" analysis under\n\nHensley—which instructs a district court to consider whether partial defeats suffered by the\n\nplaintiff are severable for purposes of awarding fees—with the \"public benefit\" standard for\n\noverall \"entitlement\" to a fee award. See Def.'s Opp'n at 8 (\"[N]ot only is EPIC not a 'prevailing\n\nparty' on that issue, it cannot demonstrate any 'public benefit' resulting from this release that\n\nwould make it entitled to attorneys' fees.\"). Hence, the fact that \"[a]ll of the references to news\n\narticles cited in EPIC's brief occurred prior the release of the\" Secret Service documents—and\n\nthus, the fact that a \"public benefit\" may not have accrued as a result of the disclosure of those\n\nspecific documents—does not mean that EPIC cannot recover fees for this work. Instead, the\n\nCourt must consider whether, under Hensley, the losses EPIC suffered in this litigation were\n\n\"distinct in all respects\" from their victories, or, instead, were sufficiently \"related\" such that its\n\nfee award should not be reduced.\n\n       Having \"considered the relationship between the amount of the fee [requested] and the\n\nresults obtained,\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, the Court finds that EPIC's limited defeats in this\n\ncase are insufficient to justify a significant reduction in EPIC's fee award. EPIC suffered only\n\ntwo \"defeats\" in this litigation. First, the Court ruled against EPIC with respect to one of the\n\nseven Secret Service documents at issue during the summary judgment briefing. But EPIC's\n\nwork on this case cannot be thinly sliced on a document-by-document basis. The controversy\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fover each individual document was not just \"related\" to the others—it was entirely overlapping.\n\nAny work that EPIC did in arguing for the release of document 10 would also have assisted it in\n\nits argument to release documents 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16. See, e.g., Pl.'s MSJ at 12 (\"With\n\nrespect to the above-mentioned documents, USSS failed to provide the required detailed\n\njustification to withhold non-exempt material as non-segregable.\") (emphasis added); Def.'s\n\nReply and Opp'n at 7 (\"The challenged documents are numbered 4-6, 10, 12, 13, and 16, and\n\nconsist of mostly contracts. . . . They are withheld in full pursuant to several FOIA exemptions.\n\nThe USSS has conducted a detailed segregability analysis of these documents and concluded that\n\nthey cannot be segregated.\") (emphasis added). In Hensley the Supreme Court explained that\n\n\"[w]here a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not\n\nhave his attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention\n\nraised.\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440; see also Action on Smoking & Health v.

So too here. EPIC's\n\nsummary judgment defeat with respect to one of the seven Secret Service documents does not\n\nwarrant an excision of its fees for this work—assuming such an act of judicial microsurgery was\n\neven possible.\n\n       EPIC's second \"defeat\" was its opposition to DHS's motion for an extension of time to\n\nfile its reply and opposition to plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment. EPIC refused to\n\nconsent to DHS's motion, and filed a six-page opposition brief. Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for\n\nExtension [Docket Entry 19]. The Court granted the extension.

This time was devoted solely to a losing issue. The Court also notes\n\nthat consent to such a motion, when the extension is sought in good faith, is generally considered\n\na matter of professional courtesy. Thus, the Court will modify EPIC's fee award to eliminate\n\nhours devoted to this issue:\n\n       Opposition to Motion for an Extension\n       Oct. 2, 2012: Attorney Rotenberg – 0.40 hours at $505 per hour = $202\n       Oct. 2, 2012: Attorney McCall – 0.20 hours at $245 per hour = $49\n\n       Total requested for work on unsuccessful opposition to motion for extension: $251\n       Deduction: 100% of $251 = $251\n\nEPIC's fee award will be reduced accordingly.\n\n       DHS also argues that \"to the extent that the Court agrees with defendant that many or\n\nmost of EPIC's fee demands are unwarranted or unsupported, the amount of 'fees on fees' should\n\nbe reduced accordingly.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 19. The Supreme Court has approved reduction of\n\npartially unsuccessful fee applications to more appropriately reflect a plaintiff's success. See INS\n\nv. Jean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112449\"><a href=\"/opinion/112449/commissioner-ins-v-jean/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 n.10 (1990). Here, while EPIC has successfully defended most of its\n\nrequested fees, the Court has partially rejected their application as well. The Court is hesitant to\n\ngo too deeply down this path, for fear of \"spawn[ing] a Kafkaesque judicial nightmare of infinite\n\nlitigation to recover fees for the last round of litigation over fees.\" Id. at 163 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Therefore, in the interests of justice and judicial economy, the Court will\n\nexercise its discretion to make an across-the-board 15% reduction of EPIC's requested award of\n\n\"fees on fees.\" The 15% reduction accounts for EPIC's substantial success on its fee motion, but\n\nalso the shortcomings of the petition—for example, the excessively vague billing entries and the\n\nimproper hourly rates charged to recent law school graduates:\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f        \"Fees on Fees\" Requested 19\n        Attorney Stepanovich: $269.50\n        Attorney Rotenberg: $1,514.50\n        Attorney McCall: $3,993.50\n        Attorney Horwitz: $3,797.50\n        Attorney Butler: $24.50\n        Attorney Jacobs: $24.50\n        Attorney Scott: $24.50\n        Original request for \"fees on fees\": $9,648.50\n        Deduction for partial defeat in fee litigation: 15% of $9,648.50 = $1,447.28\n\nEPIC's fee award will be reduced accordingly.\n\n   V.        DHS's motion to strike will be denied.\n\n        Lastly, the Court must address DHS's motion to strike certain paragraphs of EPIC's reply\n\nbrief, as well as some of the exhibits attached to that brief. DHS argues that EPIC improperly\n\ndisclosed settlement communications in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 408. The Court\n\nnotes that the existence of settlement discussions was no secret—this Court ordered the parties to\n\n\"confer and attempt to reach an agreement on fee issues.\" Mar. 4, 2013 Order. And DHS's\n\nopposition brief was the first to reference substantively the parties' settlement talks, arguing that\n\nEPIC was not entitled to \"fees on fees\" in part because \"defendant made two settlement offers\"\n\nthat EPIC rejected. Def.'s Opp'n at 18. DHS objects not just that EPIC disclosed the existence of\n\nsettlement discussions, but also the amount of DHS's settlement offers, \"in an attempt . . . to\n\ninfluence the Court's resolution of its fee petition in its favor.\" Def.'s Mot. to Strike [Docket\n\nEntry 28] at 3; see also id. (\"In violation of Rule 408, EPIC revealed to the Court that Defendant\n\nhad offered greater amounts in settlement in an obvious effort to substantiate the validity and the\n\namount of its fee petition.\").\n\n\n\n\n        19\n         The Court notes that some portion of this amount has already been deducted due to the\nbar admission status of the attorneys in question. See supra, Section IV.B. In its discretion, the\nCourt will use the entire original request to calculate this deduction.\n\n                                                 23\n\f       At the outset, it is not clear that the Federal Rules authorize this Court to strike a portion\n\nof a reply brief in support of a motion for attorney's fees. Motions to strike are typically filed\n\nunder Federal Civil Rule 12(f), which allows a district court to \"strike from a pleading an\n\ninsufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Henok v.\n\nChase Home Fin., LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (D.D.C. 2013). At least one court in this district\n\nhas pointed out that \"Rule 7(a) lists the filings that constitute pleadings, but 'motions, affidavits,\n\nbriefs and other documents are outside of the pleadings,'\" and thus \"are not subject to being\n\nstricken.\" Id. at 52-53 (quoting 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure § 1380 (3d ed. supp. 2012)); see also Michaels v. City of Vermilion, No. 05-2991,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">893185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 22, 2007) (\"[W]hile some courts have employed Rule\n\n12(f) to strike items such as an affidavit or a brief, or portions thereof, there is no basis in the\n\nFederal Rules for doing so.\"). To be sure, some authority from outside the D.C. Circuit tends to\n\nsupport the opposite conclusion, reasoning that a district court's inherent power to manage its\n\ndocket includes this authority. See, e.g., Ready Transp., Inc. v. AAR Mfg., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180077\"><a href=\"/opinion/180077/ready-transp-inc-v-aar-mfg-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n404 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"We conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction to grant the motion to\n\nstrike pursuant to its inherent powers.\").\n\n       But the Court need not resolve this question, because even assuming that the Court has\n\nthis power, it would not choose it exercise it here. While the Court \"has broad discretion in\n\nruling on a motion to strike,\" this is a \"drastic remedy,\" so \"motions to strike are disfavored.\"\n\nUzlyan v. Solis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2542518\"><a href=\"/opinion/2542518/uzlyan-v-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (D.D.C. 2010). For three reasons, the Court will not\n\nexercise its discretion to take this \"drastic\" and \"disfavored\" step. First, the Court need not—and\n\ndid not—rely on the settlement figures included by EPIC in resolving this motion. See Ali v.\n\nDist. of Columbia Gov't, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 n.5 (D.D.C. 2011) (\"[T]he Court makes no use\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fof some of the documents to which the District objects, and thus does not address their\n\nadmissibility.\"). The fact that DHS offered to settle this dispute for an amount higher than they\n\nnow argue EPIC is entitled to is neither surprising nor relevant to the Court's decision. Second,\n\nthe courts in this circuit have refused to recognize a \"federal settlement privilege,\" in re\n\nSubpoena Issued to CFTC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2528822\"><a href=\"/opinion/2528822/in-re-subpoena-issued-to-commodity-futures-trading/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (D.D.C. 2005), aff'd in part on other\n\ngrounds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186648\"><a href=\"/opinion/186648/subpoena-duces-tecum/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2006), so DHS's interest in removing these paragraphs from the\n\npublic docket is less compelling than, say, improper disclosure of information protected by the\n\nattorney-client privilege. That is so even assuming that the settlement offers would have been\n\ninadmissible at trial—a question the Court does not decide. Third, it was DHS that made the\n\nfirst substantive argument based on the parties' failed settlement negotiations in their own\n\nopposition brief. Def.'s Opp'n at 18. Striking EPIC's response to those arguments potentially\n\nraises some fairness concerns. Cf. Koch v. Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186954\"><a href=\"/opinion/186954/koch-randolph-v-cox-christopher/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"The\n\nprohibition against selective disclosure of confidential materials derives from the appropriate\n\nconcern that parties do not employ privileges both as a sword and as a shield.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Hence, in exercising its discretion, the Court will deny\n\nDHS's motion to strike.\n\n                                        *       *      *\n\n       The Court's conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n\n       Final Fee Calculations\n       EPIC's original request: $36,847.75 in fees, $350 in costs\n\n       Deductions by the Court:\n             $1,040 for hourly rate of attorney Brody\n             $1,270 for hourly rate of attorney Horwitz (before bar admission)\n             $1,300 for hourly rate of attorney Scott\n             $775 for hourly rate of attorney Horwitz (after bar admission)\n             $922.80 for vague billing entries\n             $251 for failed opposition to motion for an extension\n\n\n                                               25\n\f              $1,447.28 for partial defeat in fee litigation\n\n              Total deduction: $7,006.08\n\n       Final award: $29,841.67 in fees, $350 in costs.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, EPIC's motion for attorney's fees will be granted in part and\n\ndenied in part; DHS will be ordered to pay $29,841.67 in attorney's fees, and $350.00 in costs.\n\nDHS's motion to strike will be denied. A separate order accompanies this memorandum opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                                  /s/\n                                                           JOHN D.
