Dept. of Justice, Washington, D. C., Frederick M. Coleman, U. S. Atty., Cleveland, Ohio, for the United States, amicus curiae.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ORDER</h2>\n<p>WALINSKI, District Judge.</p>\n<p>This cause came to be heard on joint oral motions for partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56(e), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and on a motion <i>sua sponte</i> for partial judgment following a hearing before the Court on August 26, 1974, through August 30, 1974. Brought as a class action, this suit seeks to secure, for those patients, present and future, of Lima State Hospital, the so-called Right-to-Treatment. The defendants have admitted, in their answer, that such a right exists and have called upon the Court to define its parameters within this factual setting.</p>\n<p>Although the Court intends to issue a further order supplementing this one in which that bundle of Constitutional rights guaranteed to involuntary mental patients will be more extensively discussed, it should be sufficient at this juncture to indicate that it agrees with the parties that the State, upon committing an individual \"until he regains his sanity\", incurs a responsibility to provide such care as is reasonably calculated to achieve that goal. The Court has carefully studied the opinion of Judge Johnson in Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373, 344 F.Supp. 387 (M.D.Ala.1972), 325 F.Supp. 781 (M.D.Ala.1971 [appeal pending 5th Cir.]), and agrees almost totally with the reasoning of that case and the remedies announced therein Many of these paragraphs have been excerpted verbatim from that opinion.</p>\n<p>The subsequent Order referred to above will deal with the twenty-three (23) issues outlined in the Court's Order of August 20, 1974, as reserved for trial as well as general conclusions of law and findings of fact.</p>\n<p>The Court would like to take this opportunity to commend the attorneys who participated in this action. Although conducted in the true adversary manner, these proceedings were marked with the spirit of cooperation and full disclosure contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It is almost inconceivable that a case of this complexity, yielding literally reams of discovery, stipulations of fact running to some one hundred and thirty-five pages, as well as countless legal memoranda could have been completed, from the date of filing to the completion of trial, in less than sixteen months.</p>\n<p>Although everyone who participated in this action deserves commendation, the Court would like particularly to point out the contribution of Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, a local legal services group. They entered the action upon a simple letter of request from the Court, at a point at which it had become apparent that it was not humanly possible for the private attorney, originally appointed, to single-handedly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1198</span> maintain this cause without sacrificing his entire practice. They entered with no hope or promise of compensation and pointedly reemphasized, by their ability and diligence, the very real benefit such groups can afford the communities in which they operate. The private bar, however well-intentioned, cannot be expected to bring to bear the massive amounts of sophisticated legal manpower necessary to pursue an action such as this.</p>\n<p>The attitude and performance of the public officials involved herein likewise deserve mention. Both the offices of Governor John Gilligan and Ohio Attorney General William Brown were extremely cooperative in providing the Court with the volumes of research data and alternative proposals so helpful in reaching a decision herein.</p>\n<p>It therefore appearing to the Court that the press of time requires at least an interim Order at this time and the evidence adduced allows the following, it is</p>\n<p>Ordered that the defendants immediately implement a program at Lima State Hospital that complies with the attached Appendix A, Pages 1 through 32, of this Order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.

Mentally ill or mentally retarded, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. That there is an extreme likelihood that if the individual is not confined he will do immediate harm to himself or to others, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. In need of placement in a maximum security psychiatric facility as defined <i>infra.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such determination shall be made beyond a reasonable doubt and the burden of proof shall be upon the person, agency or officials seeking commitment. The individual involved shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard, and shall have the right to be represented by plaintiffs' counsel or their designee if the individual is unable to afford counsel.</p>\n<p>6) In need of placement in a maximum security psychiatric facility means an individual likely, as evidenced by recent and past history of overt acts, to do immediate harm to others so that confinement in other existing civil (or where appropriate correctional) facilities is not feasible to ensure the safety of others.</p>\n<p>7) \"Maximum security psychiatric facility\", whenever used herein, shall mean Lima State Hospital or any other institution established by the State of Ohio to carry on the functions of that facility.</p>\n<p>8) \"Ascherman\", when used within this Order, (i. e., Ascherman Act, Ascherman commitment, Ascherman facility) shall mean those patients committed to Lima State Hospital pursuant to § 2947.24 et seq. or the facility used to house such patients.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1200</span> II.</h2>\n<p>The present population of Lima State Hospital shall be individually evaluated pursuant to the following programs. Such evaluations shall be commenced on September 15, 1974, and completed in compliance with the inplementation schedule established in this Order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A.

Mentally ill or mentally retarded; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. That there is an extreme likelihood that if the individual is not confined he/she will do immediate harm to him/herself or others.</blockquote>\n<p>2) A report of the teams' finding with respect to each patient shall issue within fourteen (14) days from the commencement of the evaluation procedure, and a copy of said report shall be forwarded to all parties to this action, and to the patient, to his or her attorney, and (if the patient should request) to his or her spouse, parent, or guardian. (Hereinafter, whenever this Order requires that a copy of any report prepared regarding a patient's present mental condition be given that patient, such a requirement is expressly waived in cases in which the evaluation team deems such notice to be psychologically inappropriate, by making such a reservation upon the report.)</p>\n<p>3) Unless the team finds that the patient is both mentally ill or retarded and dangerous, as defined in ¶¶ 1(a) and (b), <i>supra,</i> the patient shall be released pursuant to appropriate procedures.</p>\n<p>4) If the patient is found by the team to be both mentally ill or retarded and dangerous, as defined in ¶¶ 1(a) and (b), <i>supra,</i> the defendants shall notify the appropriate state or local authorities forthwith. Such officials shall determine whether further hospitalization is necessary.</p>\n<p>5) Notice of determinations that patients should be further hospitalized shall be served within five (5) days of the notifications referred to in ¶ 4 above, upon the patient, his or her attorney, his or her spouse, parent or guardian and the Master assigned by this Court to conduct a hearing to determine the disposition of such patients.</p>\n<p>6) The Master shall hold a hearing forthwith as to the disposition of the patient sought to be hospitalized, unless a reasonable delay is sought by any party.</p>\n<p>7) The Master shall issue a decision forthwith ordering either that the patient be released or that the patient be transferred within 21 days to an appropriate mental health or mental retardation facility within a reasonable distance of the patient's home.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Direct Civil Commitments; Transfers from Civil Institutions</i></h2>\n<p>1) Each person who on the date of this Order is a patient at Lima State Hospital, having been committed pursuant to §§ 5122.06 through 5122.15 and 5125.03, Ohio Revised Code, shall be evaluated by an evaluation team to determine whether or not he or she is:</p>\n<blockquote>a. Mentally ill or mentally retarded; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. That there is an extreme likelihood that if he/she is not confined he/she will do immediate harm to him/herself or others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. Mentally ill or retarded and in need of placement in a maximum security psychiatric facility.</blockquote>\n<p>2) A report of the teams' findings with respect to each patient shall issue within sixty (60) days from the commencement of the evaluation procedures, and a copy of said report shall be forwarded to all parties to this action, and to the patient, his or her attorney, his or her spouse, parents or guardian.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1201</span> 3) Unless the team finds that the patient is mentally ill or retarded and dangerous, or mentally ill or retarded and in need of placement in a maximum security psychiatric facility, as defined <i>supra,</i> those patients committed to Lima State Hospital pursuant to §§ 5122.06 through 5122.15 of the Ohio Revised Code shall be released forthwith.

Notice of such determination that patient should be further retained at Lima State Hospital shall be served within five (5) days of the decision to retain such patient, upon the patient, his or her attorney, his or her spouse, parent or guardian and the Master assigned by this Court to conduct the hearing to determine the disposition of such patients. After the notification, the Master shall hold a hearing forthwith as to the disposition of the patients sought to be hospitalized, unless a reasonable delay is sought by any party. The Master shall issue a decision forthwith ordering either that the patient be retained at Lima State Hospital, transferred to an appropriate mental health facility within a reasonable distance of his or her home, or released pursuant to appropriate procedures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C.

With respect to persons committed to Lima State Hospital for observation pursuant to § 2947.25 of the Ohio Revised Code for whom no report has been submitted to the committing court and a decision is pending in said court, the report required herein shall serve as the report required by § 2947.25, Ohio Revised Code. For such person for whom a report has already been submitted to the committing court pursuant to § 2947.25, Ohio Revised Code, and a decision is pending in said court, a copy of the report herein shall also be submitted to said court.</p>\n<p>3) With respect to such patients, unless the patient is found by the team to be subject to continued commitment under validly recognized legal and medical standards, the Superintendent of Lima State Hospital shall report to the coordinator of forensic psychiatry that the patient has recovered, or that his or her condition has improved to such an extent that he or she no longer needs the special custody, care, or treatment provided by Lima State Hospital. The defendant shall cause the coordinator of forensic psychiatry to certify said report to the committing court for probation or sentencing proceedings pursuant to § 2947.27, Ohio Revised Code, and to issue an appropriate order terminating the patient's indefinite commitment to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1202</span> Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>D.

All other patients shall be provided rights set forth in the executive order (G-22) promulgated by the Director of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation on August 23, 1974. (Attached hereto as Exhibit 1.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>F.

Mentally ill or mentally retarded; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b.

Such proceedings shall be initiated forthwith with respect to the patients described in this paragraph.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this Order shall affect any issue that is before the three-judge district Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. MINIMUM CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS FOR ADEQUATE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS COMMITTED TO LIMA STATE HOSPITAL</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Placement of Patients in the Least Restrictive Setting.</i></h2>\n<p>1) The defendants shall place all persons admitted to the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation in the Least Restrictive Confinement, which means the minimum limitation of movement or activity of a patient or resident necessary to provide reasonable assurance that his dangerousness would not constitute a significant risk to others and in which treatment or habilitation continues to the fullest extent possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Individualized Treatment Plans.</i></h2>\n<p>1) Each patient shall have a comprehensive physical and mental examination and a review of behavioral status by an appropriate specialist to determine if his admission is appropriate within 72 hours after admission to the hospital.</p>\n<p>2) Each patient shall have an initial individualized treatment plan. The plan shall be developed by appropriate qualified mental health professionals, including his ward psychiatrist, and implemented as soon as possible, but in no event later than three (3) to five (5) days after the patient's admission. Thereafter, each patient shall have a final individualized treatment plan which shall be developed and implemented within fourteen (14) days of the patient's admission. Each final treatment plan shall contain:</p>\n<blockquote>a. A statement of the nature of the specific limitations and abilities, specific problems, and specific needs of the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. A statement of the patient's current mental status and the least restrictive treatment conditions necessary to achieve the treatment purposes of his commitment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. The name and title of the qualified mental health professionals who are members of the patient's treatment team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>d. A statement and rationale for the plan of treatment for achieving these intermediate and long-range goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>e. A description of intermediate and long-range treatment goals, with a projected timetable for their attainment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>f. Criteria for release to less restrictive setting for habilitation, including criteria for discharge and a projected date for discharge with a post-discharge treatment program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>g. The name of the mental health professional responsible for implementation and monitoring of the initial and final individualized treatment plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>h. A notation of any therapeutic tasks to be performed by the patient.</blockquote>\n<p>3) The treatment plan shall be continuously reviewed by the treatment team responsible for the patient's individualized treatment plan. The treatment team shall evaluate the patient's treatment program with respect to the validity of the present course of treatment and his need for a maximum security psychiatric facility. An estimated time for release shall be determined at each such review and made part of his or her record. This review shall not be less than once a week for the first month, once a month for the first ninety (90) days, and then at least every ninety (90) days thereafter. A report of all such reviews shall be placed in the patient's medical files and sent to his or her attorney, and his or her spouse, parents or guardian.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1204</span> 4) In the interest of continuity of care, one qualified mental health professional shall be responsible for supervising the implementation of the treatment plan, integrating the various aspects of the treatment program and recording the patient's progress, as measured by objective indicators. This qualified mental health professional shall also be responsible for insuring that the patient is released when appropriate into a less restrictive rehabilitative setting.</p>\n<p>5) In addition to treatment for mental disorders, patients confined to Lima State Hospital are also entitled to and shall receive appropriate treatment for physical illnesses. In providing such medical care, the defendants shall establish a preventive medical evaluation program and the hospital shall take advantage of whatever community-based facilities are appropriate and available for the cure and treatment of patient's physical disorders and shall coordinate the patient's treatment for mental illness with his medical treatment. If community-based facilities do not have the equipment or appropriate resources available to treat the patient's medical disorder, the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation shall transfer such person to the nearest appropriate institution.</p>\n<p>6) Complete records of each patient shall be maintained on the ward in which the patient is placed and shall be available to qualified mental health professionals and to non-professional staff who are directly involved with the particular patient. All information contained in a resident's records shall be considered privileged and confidential, and shall be available to anyone properly authorized in writing by the patient to review such records, including the patient, his or her attorney, and his or her spouse, parents or guardian. These records shall include:</p>\n<blockquote>a. Identification data, including the patient's legal status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. Patient's history, including but not limited to: (1) family data, educational background, and employment record; (2) prior medical history, both physical and mental, including prior hospitalization or institutionalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. The chief complaints of the patient, and the chief complaints of others regarding the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>d. An inventory of the patient's life skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>e. An evaluation which notes the onset of illness, the circumstances leading to admission, attitudes, behavior, estimate of intellectual functioning, memory functioning, orientation, and an inventory of the patient's abilities in non-interpretative fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>f. Carry a record of each physical examination which describes the results of the examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>g. A copy of the individual habilitation plan and any modifications thereto, and an appropriate summary which will guide and assist the nonprofessional staff in implementing the residents' program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>h. A detailed summary of the findings made by the reviewing qualified mental health professional after each periodic review of the treatment plan, and detailed summaries of the findings of the reviewing staff, including the findings of the independent mental health professional, after each periodic review which analyzes the successes and failures of the treatment program and directs whatever modifications are necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i. A copy of the post-institutionalization plan and any modifications thereto, and a summary of the steps that have been taken to implement the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>j. A medication history and status, which includes the signed orders of prescribing physicians. Nurses shall indicate by signature that orders have been carried out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>k. A detailed summary of each significant contact by mental health professionals with the patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1205</span> <i>l.</i> A detailed summary on at least a weekly basis by a qualified mental health professional involved in the patient's treatment on the patient's progress along the treatment plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>m. A monthly summary of the extent and nature of the resident's work activities and educational and vocational activities and the effect of such activities upon the resident's progress along habilitation plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>n. A signed order by a qualified mental health professional for any physical restraints and isolation, in accordance with the procedure set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>o.</i> A detailed summary of any extraordinary incident in the hospital involving the patient to be entered by a staff member noting that he has personal knowledge of the incident by specifying his other source of information, and initialed within 24 hours by a qualified mental health professional, included in the reports of investigation of resident mistreatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>p. A summary of family visits and contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>q. A summary of attendance and leaves from the institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>r. A record of any seizures, illnesses, treatments, immunizations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>s. The identity of the author of all entries made into a patient's medical records should be made by the use of a mental health professional identity ledger. Symbols, initials, and abbreviations used in a patient's medical records file may be done only after approval by the medical staff and when there is an explanatory ledger available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>t. A summary by the Superintendent of the hospital or his appointed agent of his findings after the fifteen (15) day review which is set forth more fully in ¶ 8, <i>infra.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>7) In addition to complying with all of the standards herein, the hospital shall make special provision for the treatment of patients who are juveniles or young adults.

The kitchen and food services unit shall be regularly inspected by public health officials on the same basis as restaurants serving the public, and the recommendations or requirements made by the public health authorities as the result of such inspection shall be implemented by the defendants within the time allowed therefor by said public health authorities. Written policies and procedures governing dietary activity should cover a system to insure that patients receive correct prescribed diets.</p>\n<p>6) Food shall be served at proper temperatures, fresh, and in reasonable varieties.</p>\n<p>7) Food shall be protected from contamination and spoilage and should be distributed under safe and sanitary conditions.

Dept. of Justice, Washington, D. C., Frederick M. Coleman, U. S. Atty., Cleveland, Ohio, for the United States, amicus curiae.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ORDER</h2>\n<p>WALINSKI, District Judge.</p>\n<p>This cause came to be heard on joint oral motions for partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56(e), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and on a motion <i>sua sponte</i> for partial judgment following a hearing before the Court on August 26, 1974, through August 30, 1974. Brought as a class action, this suit seeks to secure, for those patients, present and future, of Lima State Hospital, the so-called Right-to-Treatment. The defendants have admitted, in their answer, that such a right exists and have called upon the Court to define its parameters within this factual setting.</p>\n<p>Although the Court intends to issue a further order supplementing this one in which that bundle of Constitutional rights guaranteed to involuntary mental patients will be more extensively discussed, it should be sufficient at this juncture to indicate that it agrees with the parties that the State, upon committing an individual \"until he regains his sanity\", incurs a responsibility to provide such care as is reasonably calculated to achieve that goal. The Court has carefully studied the opinion of Judge Johnson in Wyatt v. Stickney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2303083\"><a href=\"/opinion/2303083/wyatt-v-stickney/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2303861\"><a href=\"/opinion/2303861/wyatt-v-stickney/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span> (M.D.Ala.1972), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594259\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594259/wyatt-v-stickney/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span> (M.D.Ala.1971 [appeal pending 5th Cir.]), and agrees almost totally with the reasoning of that case and the remedies announced therein Many of these paragraphs have been excerpted verbatim from that opinion.</p>\n<p>The subsequent Order referred to above will deal with the twenty-three (23) issues outlined in the Court's Order of August 20, 1974, as reserved for trial as well as general conclusions of law and findings of fact.</p>\n<p>The Court would like to take this opportunity to commend the attorneys who participated in this action. Although conducted in the true adversary manner, these proceedings were marked with the spirit of cooperation and full disclosure contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It is almost inconceivable that a case of this complexity, yielding literally reams of discovery, stipulations of fact running to some one hundred and thirty-five pages, as well as countless legal memoranda could have been completed, from the date of filing to the completion of trial, in less than sixteen months.</p>\n<p>Although everyone who participated in this action deserves commendation, the Court would like particularly to point out the contribution of Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, a local legal services group. They entered the action upon a simple letter of request from the Court, at a point at which it had become apparent that it was not humanly possible for the private attorney, originally appointed, to single-handedly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1198</span> maintain this cause without sacrificing his entire practice. They entered with no hope or promise of compensation and pointedly reemphasized, by their ability and diligence, the very real benefit such groups can afford the communities in which they operate. The private bar, however well-intentioned, cannot be expected to bring to bear the massive amounts of sophisticated legal manpower necessary to pursue an action such as this.</p>\n<p>The attitude and performance of the public officials involved herein likewise deserve mention. Both the offices of Governor John Gilligan and Ohio Attorney General William Brown were extremely cooperative in providing the Court with the volumes of research data and alternative proposals so helpful in reaching a decision herein.</p>\n<p>It therefore appearing to the Court that the press of time requires at least an interim Order at this time and the evidence adduced allows the following, it is</p>\n<p>Ordered that the defendants immediately implement a program at Lima State Hospital that complies with the attached Appendix A, Pages 1 through 32, of this Order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.

An estimated time for release shall be determined at each such review and made part of his or her record. This review shall not be less than once a week for the first month, once a month for the first ninety (90) days, and then at least every ninety (90) days thereafter.
