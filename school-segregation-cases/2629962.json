If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. 1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, Ernest Lee Allen (defendant), an inmate serving a\nterm of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined\nby § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for\nrecall of sentence and request for resentencing under the Act. Finding defendant posed\nan unreasonable risk and danger to the community should he be resentenced, the trial\ncourt denied defendant’s petition.\n       We reject defendant’s claims, inter alia, that the trial court’s determination of\ndangerousness must be reviewed for substantial evidence, the court “misapprehend[ed]”\nthe burden of proof and scope of its discretion, the court had to explore placement\npossibilities for defendant and weigh fiscal considerations, and the court failed to\nconsider all relevant evidence and criteria. We further conclude recently enacted\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). We\nhold the court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant’s petition and we affirm.\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On September 2, 1997, defendant, and the woman who was the mother of his child\nand with whom he lived, went to the Department of Social Services in Fresno County.\nDefendant had been drinking. While waiting in line, he began to yell at the woman, then,\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\fafter threatening to beat her, grabbed her by the shirt and dragged her, kicking and\nscreaming, across the floor. He pushed her through the front doors and threw her down\non the sidewalk. A security guard intervened just as defendant raised his hand to strike\nthe woman. Defendant ran away, threatening to return later.\n       On January 23, 1998, a jury convicted defendant of felony spousal abuse.\n(§ 273.5.) Defendant pled guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge (§ 242) arising out of\nan incident that occurred August 31, 1996, and the court found he had suffered two prior\nstrike convictions (§ 667, subds. (b)-(i)). On February 20, 1998, defendant was sentenced\nto prison for 25 years to life.\n       On December 19, 2012, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence and\nrequest for resentencing hearing under section 1170.126. The trial court appointed\ncounsel for defendant, and directed the parties to submit briefs addressing all relevant\nissues including defendant’s criminal conviction history, disciplinary record and record\nof rehabilitation while incarcerated, and any other evidence the parties wished to submit\nregarding risk of danger to public safety.2\n       On February 26, 2013, defense counsel filed a more complete recall petition.\nCounsel asserted defendant’s prior strike offenses consisted of 1985 convictions for\nvoluntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon; and the remainder of\ndefendant’s criminal conviction history consisted of a 1992 conviction for sexual battery\n(with violations of probation in 1992 and 1997), a 1981 conviction for battery, a 1976\nviolation of a protective order, and a 1974 conviction for burglary. Defendant’s in-prison\ndisciplinary record was not yet available, but counsel submitted three certificates of\ncompletion/achievement. Counsel also submitted a letter from defendant, in which\n\n\n2      The judge who imposed defendant’s third strike sentence was no longer a member\nof the Fresno County bench, so the matter was handled by a different judge. (See\n§ 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fdefendant explained an in-prison fight. Counsel argued defendant’s two prior strike\noffenses occurred over 27 years before, and that they were related to drug and alcohol\nabuse.\n         The People requested additional time to obtain all relevant information,\nparticularly defendant’s prison records. They did, however, lodge information\nconcerning defendant’s prior convictions and related probation officer’s report. The\nreport listed defendant’s year of birth as 1956. It described an event that occurred on\nMarch 3, 1985, during which defendant shot a woman in the head causing her to lose an\neye. Defendant had previously cohabited with the woman and she was the mother of his\nthen-two-year-old child. Before shooting her, defendant told her, “‘If I can’t have you,\ncan’t nobody have you.’” Defendant also shot the woman’s mother twice, once in the\nchest, killing her. Defendant told the mother of his child, “‘This is going to hurt you\nmore than me,’” as he shot her mother the second time. He then left the residence,\nlocking the front door. He later turned himself in to the police and was charged with\nmurder. At the time of the offense, defendant had a blood-alcohol level of 0.23 percent.\nThe report listed an “indication” defendant had “a history of substance abuse including\nalcohol and inhalants.” Defendant reported a history of psychological problems.\n         Defense counsel subsequently filed a supplemental recall petition that contained\nadditional “chronos” showing defendant’s educational achievements in custody and a\nletter of support from defendant’s brother. Counsel represented defendant had been\nclassified with the Mental Health Services Delivery System and Enhanced Outpatient\nProgram (EOP) throughout his incarceration, but could take care of himself, and should\nbe able to do so once released. Defendant would, however, need assistance obtaining\ndisability income and housing.\n         The People opposed resentencing arguing it would pose an unreasonable danger to\npublic safety. They cited to defendant’s criminal history which, they argued, was lengthy\nand showed great violence in domestic circumstances. They pointed to his failure to\n\n                                              4.\n\fbenefit from repeated efforts by society to correct his behavior. They argued defendant’s\npersistent inability or unwillingness to program in a productive manner, his unresolved\nmental health issues, current need for psychotropic medications, and continued need for\nEOP or psychiatric services. They set out his in-prison disciplinary history arguing his\nproclivity toward violence in spite of medication. There were four findings of behavior\nconducive to violence: in 2011 defendant was involved in a race/gang-related incident\ninvolving a verbal argument that escalated to clenched fists and fighting stances; in 2004\ndefendant was involved in a mutual combat; in 2000 defendant disobeyed a direct order,\ntook a “bladed” stance and said he would not be taken to the acute care hospital for\npsychiatric evaluation; and in 1999 defendant and another inmate faced each other in a\nfighting stance and threatened to fight.3 The People acknowledged defendant’s prison\nclassification score was low, but argued he had failed to engage in any meaningful self-\nhelp, work, vocational training, or education. They also noted he had no postrelease\nplans.\n         Defense counsel subsequently submitted a number of defendant’s mental health\nand medication records. Counsel argued, while defendant had been diagnosed with major\ndepressive disorder and recurrent and psychotic disorder, he was not considered a danger\nto himself or others; he had participated in extensive therapy sessions while incarcerated;\nand he had a good record with his prescribed medications, which he had taken daily for\nover 15 years. Counsel furnished portions of defendant’s mental health treatment plans,\nshowing defendant’s participation in various self-help and similar programs for the years\n2001 through 2003. Counsel also submitted his own declaration, setting out a\nconversation he had with a staff psychiatrist and staff psychologist at San Quentin State\nPrison. Those persons represented that defendant was transferred to San Quentin in mid-\n\n3     For ease of reading, some formatting (such as boldface or capitalization) has been\nomitted from our quotations from the documentary evidence.\n\n\n\n                                            5.\n\f2012 due to the perception that a higher level of mental health care was required for him\nthan had been available at Corcoran. Since his transfer, it was the opinion of Dr. Miller,\nwho most recently treated defendant, that defendant’s mental health condition had\nstabilized to the point he would only require a basic level of mental health care — either\non a residential or out-patient basis — should he be released from prison. The records\nshowed defendant was on two primary medications: Risperidone, an antipsychotic\nmedication; and Zoloft, and antidepressant medication. He was also receiving Cogentin\nfor the possible side effects of Risperidone.\n       On June 28, 2013, the court referred the matter to the probation department for a\nsupplemental report that was to include information regarding the possibility of\nsupervision under postrelease community supervision (PRCS), and of mental health\nservices. The court also appointed Dr. Terrell, who was board certified in psychiatry and\nforensic psychiatry, to examine defendant.\n       Prior to the hearing on the petition, the court received a report from EIS-\nConsultation Services for the Criminal Justice System detailing that group’s efforts with\ndefense counsel to find community supportive services for defendant, should he be\nresentenced. The report outlined various possible living and treatment scenarios, but\nconcluded ongoing services could not be readily achieved.\n       Terrell conducted a 55-minute forensic psychiatric evaluation of defendant on\nJuly 6, 2013. In addition to the pleadings filed by the parties, Terrell considered\ndocumentation from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\n(CDCR). He noted defendant was 56 years old and had been incarcerated for most of his\nadult life. Defendant reported he last experienced hallucinations and paranoia around\n2000, and had not received antipsychotic medication since approximately March 2013\nalthough he continued to receive antidepressant medication. Defendant further related he\n\n\n\n\n                                                6.\n\flast used street drugs approximately 15 years earlier.4 Defendant stated that, if released,\nhe would live with his cousin. He received disability benefits for mental illness prior to\nhis incarceration, had done farm labor work in the past, and kitchen work while in\nCDCR. His brother had offered to help him financially. Defendant said he would report\nto Fresno County Mental Health to obtain psychiatric treatment if released, and would do\nwhatever the doctor recommended.\n       Terrell found defendant’s reality contact to be good and his judgment fair, but his\ninsight extremely poor. Terrell gave defendant a number of diagnoses, most of which\nwere in institutional remission. He determined the most likely cause of defendant’s\nviolent criminal behavior over the years was antisocial personality disorder combined\nwith a long-standing history of substance abuse, and complicated by major depressive\nepisodes with psychotic features. Terrell expressed “grave[] concern[]” over defendant’s\n“extremely poor insight and complete lack of remorse for his violent actions,” and found\ndefendant’s lack of insight, lack of guilt, and lack of any evidence of remorse represented\n“very ominous signs for the possibility of success” if defendant were released back into\nthe community. Because of the lack of evidence of remorse, guilt, or insight, Terrell\nopined defendant would be “a very high risk” of resuming his abuse of street drugs and\nalcohol which, combined with defendant’s antisocial personality, would put defendant at\n“an extremely-high risk” of paranoia, psychosis, and a repeat of “extremely violent”\nbehavior. Terrell believed there was an “extremely high likelihood” that, if released,\ndefendant would “resume his pathological behavior and soon become a very high risk of\nimminent danger to the community.” Accordingly, Terrell recommended “release be\ndenied.”\n\n\n4     Defendant reported sniffing paint off and on in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s,\nfrequently abusing alcohol in the 1970’s to 1990’s, using PCP in the 1980’s, and trying\ncocaine in the 1980’s.\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\f       The probation officer recommended that, although defendant was not disqualified\nfrom resentencing, he should not be resentenced because of his prior record (criminal\nbehavior with primarily violent crimes for almost 40 years), the circumstances of the\ncommitment offense, his behavior in custody, and Terrell’s report. The probation officer\npointed out that, after shooting the mother of one of his children and taking her mother’s\nlife, defendant continued to engage in behavior in prison that could lead to violence.\n       The petition was heard July 26, 2013. The People maintained their opposition to\nresentencing describing it as “amplified … by Dr. Terrell’s report” and stating “the\ninterest in community safety is the paramount consideration.” Defense counsel argued\ndefendant’s housing was “a work in progress,” and pointed out defendant might be able\nto live in Westcare and that it would be easier to provide things such as mental health\nservices once defendant’s social security benefits were reinstated. Defense counsel\nargued that Terrell spent little time with defendant, while defendant’s mental health\ncondition, though still “a work in progress,” impressed the CDCR doctors who had\nworked with him for a number of years. Counsel suggested Terrell’s concern with\ndefendant’s tendency to minimize and find justifications for the past incidents was a\nmoral judgment, rather than a professional one. Counsel argued defendant’s criminal\nhistory was not “exceptionally voluminous,” asserted most of defendant’s in-prison\nviolations were “early on in the process,” and noted defendant’s classification score still\nhad been reduced over time from 58 to 19, the lowest score that could be given a life\ninmate. Counsel also argued defendant was 57 years old and, according to statistics,\nbecame less of a risk as he aged.\n       The trial court denied the petition. It stated in part:\n\n       “Much of this is beyond [defendant’s] control, which is actually the\n       concern of the Court. [Defendant] suffers from substantial mental health\n       problems, significant mental health problems.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\f               “So the record is clear, his initial offense was a manslaughter in\n       1985. There is subsequent violent behavior in 1998, a 273.5, which was a\n       strike. But between the manslaughter and the third strike, he has more\n       assaultive behavior, a 243.4, 242, a violation of the Court’s stay away prior\n       to that. He has discipline in [prison] including mutual combat in 2004 and\n       an incident 8/13 of 2011, that was described as ‘could lead to violence.’\n\n              “Significantly, Dr. Terrell states, ‘his lack of insight, lack of guilt,\n       and lack of any evidence of remorse represents an ominous sign.’ I\n       understand your argument, [defense counsel], that that plays into his mental\n       health issue. But then Dr. Terrell continues, ‘That there is an extremely\n       highly [sic] likelihood if released from CDCR, that [defendant] will begin\n       pathological behavior, and soon become a high risk of eminent [sic]\n       danger.’\n\n               “I — this is perhaps a textbook example of the necessity of\n       appropriate mental health services to be provided to an inmate. I am not\n       saying from a judicial perspective that the Department of Corrections has\n       failed to provide those services to [defendant], but whatever services had\n       been provided to [defendant] has not assisted him in a recovery. He still\n       remains a significant danger to the community. For those reasons, his\n       petition for resentencing is denied, and the original sentence stands.\n       [¶] … [¶] … I’m finding … there is an unreasonable risk of danger to the\n       community should [defendant] be resentenced; therefore, his petition for\n       resentencing is denied.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                             APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.5 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979,\n\n5      “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is serving an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\nof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7. [¶] (2) The inmate’s current\nsentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii),\ninclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\n\n\n                                              9.\n\f989.) If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).)\n\n    A.   A TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION REGARDING DANGEROUSNESS LIES\n         WITHIN ITS DISCRETION; ITS RULING, THEREFORE, IS REVIEWED FOR ABUSE OF\n         DISCRETION.\n\n         Defendant argues the trial court’s decision regarding dangerousness should be\nreviewed for substantial evidence. 6 We disagree. The plain language of subdivisions (f)\nand (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an exercise of the sentencing court’s discretion.\n“‘Discretion is the power to make the decision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]”\n\n\nclauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12. [¶] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses\nappearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (e).)\n6       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                              10.\n\f(People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power\nis statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed\non appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary,\ncapricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\n[Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see\nPeople v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 162 [abuse-of-discretion review asks whether\nruling in question falls outside bounds of reason under applicable law and relevant\nfacts].)\n         Under the clear language of section 1170.126, the ultimate determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. We,\ntherefore, review that determination for abuse of discretion. Of course, if there is no\nevidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an abuse of\ndiscretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066.)\n\n    B.   THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE AND IT APPLIES TO\n         PROOF OF THE FACTS, NOT TO THE TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION.\n\n         Defendant asserts the trial court misapprehended the burden of proof; that\nApprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi) requires resentencing not be\ndenied due to dangerousness unless the People have proved dangerousness beyond a\nreasonable doubt.7\n\n                 “The standard of proof, the United States Supreme Court has said,\n         ‘serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the\n         relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.’ [Citation.] At one\n\n7      The Attorney General contends defendant forfeited any claims concerning the\nstandard/burden of proof by failing to present them in the trial court. We have the\nauthority to reach defendant’s claims, regardless. (People v. Smith (2003) 31 Cal.4th\n1207, 1215; People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161-162, fn. 6.) In light of the\nnewness of the Act at the time defendant’s petition was heard, as well as the potential for\nan allegation that failure to raise the issues constituted ineffective assistance of counsel,\nwe review the claims on the merits. (See People v. Crittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 146.)\n\n\n\n                                               11.\n\f       end of the spectrum is the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard, which\n       apportions the risk of error among litigants in roughly equal fashion.\n       [Citation.] At the other end of the spectrum is the ‘beyond a reasonable\n       doubt’ standard applied in criminal cases, in which ‘our society imposes\n       almost the entire risk of error upon itself.’ [Citation.] Between those two\n       standards is the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n       [Citation.] These three standards are codified in California’s Evidence\n       Code. Section 115 of that code states: ‘The burden of proof may require a\n       party to … establish the existence or nonexistence of a fact by a\n       preponderance of the evidence, by clear and convincing proof, or by proof\n       beyond a reasonable doubt. [¶] Except as otherwise provided by law, the\n       burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.’\n       (Italics added.)\n\n             “If the Legislature has not established a standard of proof, a court\n       must determine the appropriate standard by considering all aspects of the\n       law. [Citation.] No standard of proof is specified in section [1170.126] .…\n\n               “‘The standard of proof that is required in a given instance has been\n       said to reflect “… the degree of confidence our society thinks [the fact\n       finder] should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular\n       type of adjudication.” … The standard of proof may therefore vary,\n       depending upon the gravity of the consequences that would result from an\n       erroneous determination of the issue involved.’ [Citations.]” (People v.\n       Arriaga (2014) 58 Cal.4th 950, 961-962.)\n\n       “In enacting section 1170.126 as part of Proposition 36, the issue before the voters\nwas not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly for a particular\naspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to warrant an\nindeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now be eligible for\na lesser term.” (People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1036.) Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\n\n\n                                             12.\n\fimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother factors do. Because of the severe consequences to society that may result if a\ndangerous inmate is resentenced as a second strike offender and released to the\ncommunity upon completion of his or her term with little or no supervision (see, e.g.,\n§ 3451) and without undergoing any suitability assessment (see, e.g., In re Lawrence\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1204), we believe it appropriate to apportion the risk of error in\nroughly equal fashion.\n       Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has similarly so found. It\nhas stated that, where a court’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is\nconcerned, the People bear the burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301-\n1305 & fn. 25 (Kaulick); see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court determined this is so\nbecause “dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a\ndefendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be\ncrossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303.)\nKaulick explained:\n              “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly\n       situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life\n       term to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him\n       with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts\n       are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence\n       based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. As\n       such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\n       his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e.,\n       dangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a\n       reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Ibid.)\n\n       In People v. Blakely (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1059-1062 (Blakely), we\nrejected the claim an inmate seeking resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126 had a\nSixth Amendment right to a jury determination, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the\nquestion of conduct constituting a disqualifying factor. We concluded that Apprendi,\nsupra, 530 U.S. 466 and its progeny (e.g., Alleyne v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. ___\n\n                                            13.\n\f[133 S.Ct. 2151]; Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 (Cunningham); Blakely\nv. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296) “do not apply to a determination of eligibility for\nresentencing under the Act.” (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) We also\nrelied heavily on Kaulick.\n       In rejecting application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, Kaulick\ndiscussed the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion in Dillon v. United States (2010)\n560 U.S. 817, 828 (Dillon), that “a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward\nsentence modifications due to intervening laws.”8 (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1304.) Kaulick found Dillon’s language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the\nAct is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and\nprovides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any\nfacts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth\nAmendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1304-1305.)\n       Although in Blakely, we applied Kaulick’s analysis to the initial determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it\napplies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate’s petition does not\nincrease the penalty to which that inmate is already subject, but instead removes the\ninmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is\nnot constitutionally entitled. (Id. at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a determination\nof dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n8      Pepper v. United States (2011) 562 U.S. 476 [131 S.Ct. 1229] does not undermine\nDillon’s or Kaulick’s reliance thereon. Unlike Dillon, Pepper involved a plenary\nresentencing after the defendant’s sentence had been set aside on appeal. (Pepper, supra,\n562 U.S. at p. ___ [131 S.Ct. at p. 1236].)\n\n\n\n                                             14.\n\f        We hold preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of proof,\nregardless whether we analyze the issue as one of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence or due\nprocess. (See People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1076.)9\n        This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in making its\nultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review that\ndetermination for substantial evidence. Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness\nmust preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.\n        The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute does not say the\npetitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a\nrisk.\n        Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\n\n\n9      We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., People v.\nThomas (1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 637-638.) Defendant received the protections of that\nstandard of proof (and the right to a jury trial) at the time he was found to have suffered\nhis prior strike convictions, however. (People v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007, 1015;\nPeople v. Towers (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1277.)\n\n\n\n                                             15.\n\fat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself.10 Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme. 11 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham, “three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses.\nThe trial court’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by\nsection 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of\nthe middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the\ncrime.’” (People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 808, fn. omitted.) Trial courts had\n“broad discretion” to impose the lower or upper term instead of the middle term of\nimprisonment (People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 349), and generally were required by\n\n\n10      As noted, ante, we have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial\ndetermination whether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (Blakely,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n11     The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative …, and therefore … there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1362.)\n\n\n\n                                              16.\n\fthe statutes and sentencing rules to state reasons for their discretionary sentencing choices\n(ibid.). Such reasons had to be “supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the\nrecord” and reasonably related to the particular sentencing determination. (Ibid.; see\nformer Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and\namended in response to Cunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection\nof the appropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute,\nestablishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect\nto certain discretionary sentencing decisions. (See In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524,\n557-558.)12\n       In People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the\ntrial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’ [citation]; it is not required to identify\naggravating and mitigating factors, apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, or\nspecify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[] the term selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the\ncourt must ‘state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise\nof discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       The trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight\nof mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\n\n12      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                                17.\n\funreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n          To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\nfinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial\nevidence. 13 If a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is\nviolent due to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a\npreponderance of the evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.\n(See People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion\nwhen factual findings critical to decision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read\n(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 685, 689-691 [where trial court erroneously determined defendant\nwas statutorily ineligible for probation, reviewing court was required to determine\nwhether trial court gave sufficient other reasons, supported by facts of case, for probation\ndenial].)\n     C.   SECTION 1170.126 DOES NOT ESTABLISH OR CONTAIN A PRESUMPTION A\n          PETITIONER’S SENTENCE BE REDUCED.\n\n          Defendant essentially argues, however, that sentence reduction under the Act is\nnow the rule, not the exception. This being the case, he says, trial courts have only\n\n\n\n13     We agree with defendant that “substantial evidence,” not the significantly more\ndeferential “some evidence” standard applicable to review of executive branch decisions\nin parole cases (see In re Rosenkrantz (2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 658, 665), is the appropriate\nappellate standard.\n\n\n\n                                               18.\n\flimited or “narrowly-circumscribed” discretion in denying relief on the ground of\nunreasonable danger to public safety.\n       First, defendant argues a section 1170.126 resentencing “is the converse of” a\nRomero hearing and establishes a presumption that the life term be reduced to a second\nstrike sentence.\n       In People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 (Romero), the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that trial courts retain discretion to strike, in furtherance\nof justice under section 1385, subdivision (a), prior felony conviction allegations in cases\nbrought under the three strikes law. (Romero, supra, at pp. 529-530.) The court\nsubsequently clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do so, “the court in question\nmust consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies\nand prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background,\ncharacter, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in\nwhole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been\nconvicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams, supra, 17\nCal.4th at p. 161.)\n       Because the three strikes law was intended to restrict trial courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained:\n\n              “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it\n       carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\n       requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the\n       law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these\n       sentencing norms is both rational and proper.\n\n              “In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\n       discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited\n       circumstances. For example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial\n\n                                             19.\n\f       court was not ‘aware of its discretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the\n       court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation].\n       Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the Three Strikes law\n       may, as a matter of law,] produce[] an “arbitrary, capricious or patently\n       absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.]\n\n              “But ‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might\n       disagree about whether to strike one or more’ prior conviction allegations.\n       [Citation.] … Because the circumstances must be ‘extraordinary … by\n       which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\n       scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a\n       long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was\n       meant to attack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people\n       could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes\n       scheme must be even more extraordinary.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at p. 378.)\n       As we explained in Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1054, “The purpose of\nthe three strikes law has been variously stated as being ‘“to ensure longer prison\nsentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been\npreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses”’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Because\npublic safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject defendant’s\nassertion that a section 1170.126 proceeding is the converse of a Romero determination,\nso that any refusal to resentence an eligible inmate must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.14\n\n\n14     Because a trial court can deny resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), only upon a finding of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a trial\ncourt would abuse its discretion, as in a Romero situation, by refusing to resentence a\npetitioner because of antipathy toward the Act or a personal belief a particular defendant\ndeserved an indeterminate term for reasons other than dangerousness. (See People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 159, 161.)\n\n\n\n                                             20.\n\f       Second, defendant points to the syntax of section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\nRelying on People v. Guinn (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1141-1142, 1145 and its\nprogeny (e.g., People v. Murray (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 277, 282; People v. Ybarra\n(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1089), all of which deal with section 190.5,\nsubdivision (b), defendant contends the “shall”/“unless” formulation employed in\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 “establishes a presumption in favor of resentencing,\nwith a sentencing court’s discretion to depart from that generally mandatory prescription\nnarrowly circumscribed and reserved for extraordinary cases.”15 Because resentencing\nan eligible petitioner to a second strike term is the “‘generally mandatory’ disposition,”\ndefendant argues, a trial court retains only “‘circumscribed’ discretion upon proof of an\n‘unreasonable’ danger to ‘public safety’ to leave intact the more draconian punishment\nthat the … Act now abolishes.”\n       The California Supreme Court recently disapproved the cases relied on by\ndefendant. (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1370, 1387.) Leaving aside\nconstitutional questions raised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without\nparole for juveniles after the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Miller v. Alabama\n(2012) 567 U.S. ___ [132 S.Ct. 2455], the state high court’s review of the text of\nsection 190.5, subdivision (b) led it to conclude the syntax is ambiguous concerning any\npresumption. The court stated: “It is not unreasonable to read this text … to mean that a\ncourt ‘shall’ impose life without parole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence\nof 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to\n\n\n15     Section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “The penalty for a\ndefendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more\nspecial circumstances … has been found to be true …, who was 16 years of age or older\nand under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be\nconfinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the\ndiscretion of the court, 25 years to life.”\n\n\n\n                                             21.\n\fread the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords\nwith common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take\na final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the\nstudents to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of\nsection 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended\nto make life without parole the presumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Thus, we do not agree with defendant that resentencing to a second strike\nterm is the generally mandatory disposition, subject only to circumscribed discretion to\nretain the indeterminate third strike term. A court considering whether to resentence an\neligible petitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion in\nthe sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it.\nThis does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find\ndangerousness in extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which\nsuch a finding is rational under the totality of the circumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover, a\nconclusion there is a strong presumption in favor of resentencing that will only be\novercome in an extraordinary case, due to the trial court’s circumscribed discretion,\nwould run directly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act. (See People v.\nGutierrez, supra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter\nintent in attempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].) As we stated in People v. Osuna,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of\nthe Act’ [citation].” Thus, although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars\n(People v. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw\n\n                                             22.\n\fopen the prison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for\nserious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or\nposing little or no risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038, second italics added.) Had voters\nintended to permit retention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they\nwould have said so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing\nlanguage that affords courts broad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not\nhave afforded the court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to\nthe issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute.\n                                              II\n                               THE TRIAL COURT’S RULING\n       Applying the foregoing principles to the trial court’s ruling, we find no abuse of\ndiscretion. Several of defendant’s assertions require brief discussion, however.\n       First, defendant claims that, given the “strong basis” for his past behavior in his\nmental illness coupled with substance abuse and his low intellectual ability, the trial court\n“was required to explore the possibilities of placement for [defendant] upon resentencing\nthat could be available and which could address any concerns regarding unpredictability\ndue to his mental condition and low intellectual functioning before peremptorily\nslamming the door under the Act .…” The terms of the court’s referral of the matter to\nthe probation department for a supplemental report and its consideration of the EIS report\nshow the court did indeed explore the possibilities of appropriate placement.\n       Defendant appears to recognize this fact when he says “explorative efforts had\nbeen made to identify a residential group setting to which [defendant] could be released\nin which his life would be structured and supervised and he would receive support.” He\nargues, however, that the problems found by Terrell (e.g., the likelihood defendant would\nagain abuse substances once released) would have been ameliorated if social services\ncould place defendant in a supervised, structured group home where he could be\nmonitored and receive appropriate support services. Defendant says: “That such\n\n                                              23.\n\fplacement had not yet been found at the time of the hearing here did not mean that such\nplacement was forever unavailable”; hence, the trial court “was obliged to leave such\navenue open for a reasonable time.” But the section 1170.126 hearing had to be held at\nsome point or another. Moreover, it appears, from the EIS report, that even if an\nappropriate placement could have been found, it would have taken several months for\ndefendant to be admitted, either because of space considerations or because he could not\nafford to pay until his social security benefits were reinstated, something that could not\noccur until he was released from prison. The problem here is that if defendant relapsed\n— something Terrell, an expert, felt likely if defendant were simply released back into\nthe community — there was a strong probability defendant would not merely return to\nproperty crimes, but would revert to the sort of violent behavior that had marred his past\nand resulted in him being sentenced to a third strike term in the first place. Under the\ncircumstances, we do not believe the trial court was required to resentence him and then\ncross its fingers.16\n       Defendant also contends the trial court failed to credit the evidence defendant had\nnot used alcohol or drugs for the last 15 years, despite their wide availability in prison,\nand that he was compliant with the prescribed treatment program for his mental illness.\nDefendant also says the trial court failed to consider evidence with regard to the criteria\nset out in section 1170.126, subdivision (g), such as the remoteness of defendant’s crimes\nand his low classification score. These matters were, however, all before the court\nthrough reports, the parties’ pleadings, or argument. That the court did not expressly\n\n\n16     Had defendant been resentenced, he would have been subject to mandatory PRCS\nupon release. (People v. Tubbs (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 578, 585-586; People v.\nEspinoza (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 635, 637-638.) The trial court considered the\npossibility of PRCS, however, and nothing in the record suggests such supervision would\nhave been sufficient to meet defendant’s needs so as to allay public safety concerns,\nespecially in light of Terrell’s conclusions.\n\n\n\n                                             24.\n\fmention them does not mean it failed to consider them and, in the absence of any\nshowing to the contrary, we presume it did so. (Evid. Code, § 664; see Denham v.\nSuperior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564; cf. People v. Sparks (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d\n597, 600-601.)\n       Finally, defendant contends that, in light of the Act’s express purpose of “a more\nrational and cost-effective allocation of the crippling expenses of California’s prison\nsystem,” trial courts are required to weigh fiscal considerations in deciding resentencing\npetitions, something the trial court here did not do. In our view, the notion that the cost\nof incarceration has some bearing on whether resentencing a particular inmate would\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is a non sequitur. Although saving\nmoney is a goal of the Act, it does not override the primary purpose of the three strikes\nlaw and the Act as a whole — the protection of public safety. (See People v. Osuna,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036-1038.) The trial court was not required to take the\ncost of continued imprisonment into account or undertake the equivalent of a cost-benefit\nanalysis in determining whether resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety; the Act already did so, and the electorate has determined\nkeeping criminals who pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety behind bars\nfor their full three strikes sentence is more important than saving money.\n                                              III\n                            SECTION 1170.18, SUBDIVISION (C)\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\n\n                                              25.\n\fpetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)17\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n17     Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                26.\n\f              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.18\n       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014.) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the voters, “their\nintent governs. [Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n       To determine intent, “‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) We give the\nstatute’s words “‘a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however,\nconsider the statutory language “in isolation.” [Citation.] Rather, we look to “the entire\nsubstance of the statute … in order to determine the scope and purpose of the\n\n18     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n\n\n\n                                            27.\n\fprovision .… [Citation.]” [Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question “‘in\ncontext, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute .…’ [Citation.]”\n[Citation.] We must harmonize “the various parts of a statutory enactment … by\nconsidering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a\nwhole.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112.) We\n“accord[] significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the\nlegislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.…\n[S]tatutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both\ninternally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v.\nFair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387.)\n       “‘“When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nconstruction and courts should not indulge in it.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nHendrix (1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 512.) On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\nemployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47. (See People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153, 164-165, 166; see\nalso Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1254-\n1255; People v. Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.)\n       This does not mean, however, that the definition contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) must inexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf.\nMarshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1255.) “The\nliteral language of a statute does not prevail if it conflicts with the lawmakers’ intent .…\n[Citations.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1033-1034.) “‘The\napparent purpose of a statute will not be sacrificed to a literal construction.’ [Citation.]”\n(Cossack v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733.) Rather, “the literal meaning\nof a statute must be in accord with its purpose.” (People v. Mohammed (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 920, 927.) “[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a\n\n                                             28.\n\fliteral meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the [voters] did not\nintend” (In re Michele D. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606), or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]” (In re\nMichele D., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 606; accord, People v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90,\n95.)\n       Thus, “‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be\nachieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\ncontemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the\nstatute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘“refer to other indicia of the voters’\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We\nconsider “the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation” (Dyna-Med,\nInc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1387), as well as “the\nwider historical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’ enactment (ibid.). “‘Using\nthese extrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports most closely with the\napparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the\ngeneral purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd\nconsequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\n\n                                             29.\n\fthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-\n       824.)19\n\n\n\n19      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                             30.\n\f       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\n\n                                             31.\n\fthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110, original italics omitted, italics\nadded.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036,\n“Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public\nsafety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\n\n\n\n                                              32.\n\fstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n\n\n\n                                             33.\n\f       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n\n                                            34.\n\f2014) L.A. Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-\n20141106-story.html> [as of Jan. 30, 2015].) Looking at the information conveyed to\nvoters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is of no import.\n(Cf. People v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v. Bradley (2012)\n208 Cal.App.4th 64, 83; Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering,\nInc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 30.)\n       We are also mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed\nto be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; accord, In re\nLance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763,\n769-770; People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the\nballot materials for Proposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention the definition of the\nphrase contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) would apply to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to\nalter the Act in that respect. Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all\npotential effects of a proposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter\ninformation guides containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a\nneutral explanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of\nand in opposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials\nso much as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing\nunder the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th\n\n\n\n                                             35.\n\fat pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of enactment included information bill would add\ndefinition of particular term to Public Contract Code].)20\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 &\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\n\n20     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). (Cf. Re-Open Rambla, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1995) 39\nCal.App.4th 1499, 1511; In re Connie M. (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238.)\n\n\n\n                                            36.\n\fprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).21\n\n21      Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (2014) 231\nCal.App.4th 1391, 1395-1396, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Jan. 8, 2015.)\nChaney did not decide whether Proposition 47’s definition applies prospectively to such\npetitions. (Chaney, supra, at p. 1397, fn. 3.) Were we to conclude section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we would agree with Chaney\nthat it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that a finding of\nnonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only application, and\nthat prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to resentencing\npetitions under the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal protection\n\n\n                                             37.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                                _____________________\n                                                                          DETJEN, J.\nI CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n LEVY, Acting P.J.\n\n\n\n\nissues. “Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were we to\naccept a literal construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation wherever\npossible both to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so as to\npreserve their constitutionality [citations]” (People v. Skinner (1985) 39 Cal.3d 765, 769),\nwe rest our holding on the reasoning set out in our opinion, ante.\n\n\n\n                                            38.\n\fPEÑA, J.,\n       I concur in the judgment and the majority opinion with the exception of part III. I\nagree defendant Ernest Lee Allen may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly\nenacted definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal\nCode section 1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any\nambiguity in the language used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does\nnot mean what it says, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.”\nRather, in my view, there is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c),\nintended it to apply retroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the\nThree Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\f               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v. Kefauver (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371.) Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th\n294, 301.)\n       In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write\non a blank slate. For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119\nCal.App.4th 1241, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.”\n       In a similar vein, the court in People v. Leal (2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant cites In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 to argue retroactive\napplication.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\n\n\n                                             5.\n\frepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime. 2 Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.3 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                         ___________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n2For this reason, Holder v. Superior Court (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 314, also relied upon\nby defendant, does not apply because its analysis and conclusion were based on Estrada\nprior to its clarification by subsequent California Supreme Court cases.\n3Recently  in People v. Chaney (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1391, the Third District Court of\nAppeal held the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as provided\nin section 1170.18(c) does not apply retroactively. I agree.\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f",

(c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for\nrecall of sentence and request for resentencing under the Act. Finding defendant posed\nan unreasonable risk and danger to the community should he be resentenced, the trial\ncourt denied defendant’s petition.\n       We reject defendant’s claims, inter alia, that the trial court’s determination of\ndangerousness must be reviewed for substantial evidence, the court “misapprehend[ed]”\nthe burden of proof and scope of its discretion, the court had to explore placement\npossibilities for defendant and weigh fiscal considerations, and the court failed to\nconsider all relevant evidence and criteria. We further conclude recently enacted\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). We\nhold the court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant’s petition and we affirm.\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On September 2, 1997, defendant, and the woman who was the mother of his child\nand with whom he lived, went to the Department of Social Services in Fresno County.\nDefendant had been drinking. While waiting in line, he began to yell at the woman, then,\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\fafter threatening to beat her, grabbed her by the shirt and dragged her, kicking and\nscreaming, across the floor. He pushed her through the front doors and threw her down\non the sidewalk. A security guard intervened just as defendant raised his hand to strike\nthe woman. Defendant ran away, threatening to return later.\n       On January 23, 1998, a jury convicted defendant of felony spousal abuse.\n(§ 273.5.) Defendant pled guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge (§ 242) arising out of\nan incident that occurred August 31, 1996, and the court found he had suffered two prior\nstrike convictions (§ 667, subds. (b)-(i)). On February 20, 1998, defendant was sentenced\nto prison for 25 years to life.\n       On December 19, 2012, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence and\nrequest for resentencing hearing under section 1170.126. The trial court appointed\ncounsel for defendant, and directed the parties to submit briefs addressing all relevant\nissues including defendant’s criminal conviction history, disciplinary record and record\nof rehabilitation while incarcerated, and any other evidence the parties wished to submit\nregarding risk of danger to public safety.2\n       On February 26, 2013, defense counsel filed a more complete recall petition.\nCounsel asserted defendant’s prior strike offenses consisted of 1985 convictions for\nvoluntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon; and the remainder of\ndefendant’s criminal conviction history consisted of a 1992 conviction for sexual battery\n(with violations of probation in 1992 and 1997), a 1981 conviction for battery, a 1976\nviolation of a protective order, and a 1974 conviction for burglary. Defendant’s in-prison\ndisciplinary record was not yet available, but counsel submitted three certificates of\ncompletion/achievement. Counsel also submitted a letter from defendant, in which\n\n\n2      The judge who imposed defendant’s third strike sentence was no longer a member\nof the Fresno County bench, so the matter was handled by a different judge. (See\n§ 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fdefendant explained an in-prison fight. Counsel argued defendant’s two prior strike\noffenses occurred over 27 years before, and that they were related to drug and alcohol\nabuse.\n         The People requested additional time to obtain all relevant information,\nparticularly defendant’s prison records. They did, however, lodge information\nconcerning defendant’s prior convictions and related probation officer’s report. The\nreport listed defendant’s year of birth as 1956. It described an event that occurred on\nMarch 3, 1985, during which defendant shot a woman in the head causing her to lose an\neye. Defendant had previously cohabited with the woman and she was the mother of his\nthen-two-year-old child. Before shooting her, defendant told her, “‘If I can’t have you,\ncan’t nobody have you.’” Defendant also shot the woman’s mother twice, once in the\nchest, killing her. Defendant told the mother of his child, “‘This is going to hurt you\nmore than me,’” as he shot her mother the second time. He then left the residence,\nlocking the front door. He later turned himself in to the police and was charged with\nmurder. At the time of the offense, defendant had a blood-alcohol level of 0.23 percent.\nThe report listed an “indication” defendant had “a history of substance abuse including\nalcohol and inhalants.” Defendant reported a history of psychological problems.\n         Defense counsel subsequently filed a supplemental recall petition that contained\nadditional “chronos” showing defendant’s educational achievements in custody and a\nletter of support from defendant’s brother. Counsel represented defendant had been\nclassified with the Mental Health Services Delivery System and Enhanced Outpatient\nProgram (EOP) throughout his incarceration, but could take care of himself, and should\nbe able to do so once released. Defendant would, however, need assistance obtaining\ndisability income and housing.\n         The People opposed resentencing arguing it would pose an unreasonable danger to\npublic safety. They cited to defendant’s criminal history which, they argued, was lengthy\nand showed great violence in domestic circumstances. They pointed to his failure to\n\n                                              4.\n\fbenefit from repeated efforts by society to correct his behavior. They argued defendant’s\npersistent inability or unwillingness to program in a productive manner, his unresolved\nmental health issues, current need for psychotropic medications, and continued need for\nEOP or psychiatric services. They set out his in-prison disciplinary history arguing his\nproclivity toward violence in spite of medication. There were four findings of behavior\nconducive to violence: in 2011 defendant was involved in a race/gang-related incident\ninvolving a verbal argument that escalated to clenched fists and fighting stances; in 2004\ndefendant was involved in a mutual combat; in 2000 defendant disobeyed a direct order,\ntook a “bladed” stance and said he would not be taken to the acute care hospital for\npsychiatric evaluation; and in 1999 defendant and another inmate faced each other in a\nfighting stance and threatened to fight.3 The People acknowledged defendant’s prison\nclassification score was low, but argued he had failed to engage in any meaningful self-\nhelp, work, vocational training, or education. They also noted he had no postrelease\nplans.\n         Defense counsel subsequently submitted a number of defendant’s mental health\nand medication records. Counsel argued, while defendant had been diagnosed with major\ndepressive disorder and recurrent and psychotic disorder, he was not considered a danger\nto himself or others; he had participated in extensive therapy sessions while incarcerated;\nand he had a good record with his prescribed medications, which he had taken daily for\nover 15 years. Counsel furnished portions of defendant’s mental health treatment plans,\nshowing defendant’s participation in various self-help and similar programs for the years\n2001 through 2003. Counsel also submitted his own declaration, setting out a\nconversation he had with a staff psychiatrist and staff psychologist at San Quentin State\nPrison. Those persons represented that defendant was transferred to San Quentin in mid-\n\n3     For ease of reading, some formatting (such as boldface or capitalization) has been\nomitted from our quotations from the documentary evidence.\n\n\n\n                                            5.\n\f2012 due to the perception that a higher level of mental health care was required for him\nthan had been available at Corcoran. Since his transfer, it was the opinion of Dr. Miller,\nwho most recently treated defendant, that defendant’s mental health condition had\nstabilized to the point he would only require a basic level of mental health care — either\non a residential or out-patient basis — should he be released from prison. The records\nshowed defendant was on two primary medications: Risperidone, an antipsychotic\nmedication; and Zoloft, and antidepressant medication. He was also receiving Cogentin\nfor the possible side effects of Risperidone.\n       On June 28, 2013, the court referred the matter to the probation department for a\nsupplemental report that was to include information regarding the possibility of\nsupervision under postrelease community supervision (PRCS), and of mental health\nservices. The court also appointed Dr. Terrell, who was board certified in psychiatry and\nforensic psychiatry, to examine defendant.\n       Prior to the hearing on the petition, the court received a report from EIS-\nConsultation Services for the Criminal Justice System detailing that group’s efforts with\ndefense counsel to find community supportive services for defendant, should he be\nresentenced. The report outlined various possible living and treatment scenarios, but\nconcluded ongoing services could not be readily achieved.\n       Terrell conducted a 55-minute forensic psychiatric evaluation of defendant on\nJuly 6, 2013. In addition to the pleadings filed by the parties, Terrell considered\ndocumentation from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\n(CDCR). He noted defendant was 56 years old and had been incarcerated for most of his\nadult life. Defendant reported he last experienced hallucinations and paranoia around\n2000, and had not received antipsychotic medication since approximately March 2013\nalthough he continued to receive antidepressant medication. Defendant further related he\n\n\n\n\n                                                6.\n\flast used street drugs approximately 15 years earlier.4 Defendant stated that, if released,\nhe would live with his cousin. He received disability benefits for mental illness prior to\nhis incarceration, had done farm labor work in the past, and kitchen work while in\nCDCR. His brother had offered to help him financially. Defendant said he would report\nto Fresno County Mental Health to obtain psychiatric treatment if released, and would do\nwhatever the doctor recommended.\n       Terrell found defendant’s reality contact to be good and his judgment fair, but his\ninsight extremely poor. Terrell gave defendant a number of diagnoses, most of which\nwere in institutional remission. He determined the most likely cause of defendant’s\nviolent criminal behavior over the years was antisocial personality disorder combined\nwith a long-standing history of substance abuse, and complicated by major depressive\nepisodes with psychotic features. Terrell expressed “grave[] concern[]” over defendant’s\n“extremely poor insight and complete lack of remorse for his violent actions,” and found\ndefendant’s lack of insight, lack of guilt, and lack of any evidence of remorse represented\n“very ominous signs for the possibility of success” if defendant were released back into\nthe community. Because of the lack of evidence of remorse, guilt, or insight, Terrell\nopined defendant would be “a very high risk” of resuming his abuse of street drugs and\nalcohol which, combined with defendant’s antisocial personality, would put defendant at\n“an extremely-high risk” of paranoia, psychosis, and a repeat of “extremely violent”\nbehavior. Terrell believed there was an “extremely high likelihood” that, if released,\ndefendant would “resume his pathological behavior and soon become a very high risk of\nimminent danger to the community.” Accordingly, Terrell recommended “release be\ndenied.”\n\n\n4     Defendant reported sniffing paint off and on in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s,\nfrequently abusing alcohol in the 1970’s to 1990’s, using PCP in the 1980’s, and trying\ncocaine in the 1980’s.\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\f       The probation officer recommended that, although defendant was not disqualified\nfrom resentencing, he should not be resentenced because of his prior record (criminal\nbehavior with primarily violent crimes for almost 40 years), the circumstances of the\ncommitment offense, his behavior in custody, and Terrell’s report. The probation officer\npointed out that, after shooting the mother of one of his children and taking her mother’s\nlife, defendant continued to engage in behavior in prison that could lead to violence.\n       The petition was heard July 26, 2013. The People maintained their opposition to\nresentencing describing it as “amplified … by Dr. Terrell’s report” and stating “the\ninterest in community safety is the paramount consideration.” Defense counsel argued\ndefendant’s housing was “a work in progress,” and pointed out defendant might be able\nto live in Westcare and that it would be easier to provide things such as mental health\nservices once defendant’s social security benefits were reinstated. Defense counsel\nargued that Terrell spent little time with defendant, while defendant’s mental health\ncondition, though still “a work in progress,” impressed the CDCR doctors who had\nworked with him for a number of years. Counsel suggested Terrell’s concern with\ndefendant’s tendency to minimize and find justifications for the past incidents was a\nmoral judgment, rather than a professional one. Counsel argued defendant’s criminal\nhistory was not “exceptionally voluminous,” asserted most of defendant’s in-prison\nviolations were “early on in the process,” and noted defendant’s classification score still\nhad been reduced over time from 58 to 19, the lowest score that could be given a life\ninmate. Counsel also argued defendant was 57 years old and, according to statistics,\nbecame less of a risk as he aged.\n       The trial court denied the petition. It stated in part:\n\n       “Much of this is beyond [defendant’s] control, which is actually the\n       concern of the Court. [Defendant] suffers from substantial mental health\n       problems, significant mental health problems.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\f               “So the record is clear, his initial offense was a manslaughter in\n       1985. There is subsequent violent behavior in 1998, a 273.5, which was a\n       strike. But between the manslaughter and the third strike, he has more\n       assaultive behavior, a 243.4, 242, a violation of the Court’s stay away prior\n       to that. He has discipline in [prison] including mutual combat in 2004 and\n       an incident 8/13 of 2011, that was described as ‘could lead to violence.’\n\n              “Significantly, Dr. Terrell states, ‘his lack of insight, lack of guilt,\n       and lack of any evidence of remorse represents an ominous sign.’ I\n       understand your argument, [defense counsel], that that plays into his mental\n       health issue. But then Dr. Terrell continues, ‘That there is an extremely\n       highly [sic] likelihood if released from CDCR, that [defendant] will begin\n       pathological behavior, and soon become a high risk of eminent [sic]\n       danger.’\n\n               “I — this is perhaps a textbook example of the necessity of\n       appropriate mental health services to be provided to an inmate. I am not\n       saying from a judicial perspective that the Department of Corrections has\n       failed to provide those services to [defendant], but whatever services had\n       been provided to [defendant] has not assisted him in a recovery. He still\n       remains a significant danger to the community. For those reasons, his\n       petition for resentencing is denied, and the original sentence stands.\n       [¶] … [¶] … I’m finding … there is an unreasonable risk of danger to the\n       community should [defendant] be resentenced; therefore, his petition for\n       resentencing is denied.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                             APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.5 (People v.

If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd.

Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                              10.\n\f(People v.

Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\n\n\n                                             12.\n\fimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother factors do. Because of the severe consequences to society that may result if a\ndangerous inmate is resentenced as a second strike offender and released to the\ncommunity upon completion of his or her term with little or no supervision (see, e.g.,\n§ 3451) and without undergoing any suitability assessment (see, e.g., In re Lawrence\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1204), we believe it appropriate to apportion the risk of error in\nroughly equal fashion.\n       Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has similarly so found. It\nhas stated that, where a court’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is\nconcerned, the People bear the burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

That court determined this is so\nbecause “dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a\ndefendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be\ncrossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303.)\nKaulick explained:\n              “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly\n       situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life\n       term to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him\n       with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts\n       are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence\n       based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. As\n       such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\n       his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e.,\n       dangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a\n       reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Ibid.)\n\n       In People v.

We also\nrelied heavily on Kaulick.\n       In rejecting application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, Kaulick\ndiscussed the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion in Dillon v. United States (2010)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 (Dillon), that “a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward\nsentence modifications due to intervening laws.”8 (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1304.) Kaulick found Dillon’s language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the\nAct is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and\nprovides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any\nfacts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth\nAmendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1304-1305.)\n       Although in Blakely, we applied Kaulick’s analysis to the initial determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it\napplies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate’s petition does not\nincrease the penalty to which that inmate is already subject, but instead removes the\ninmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is\nnot constitutionally entitled. (Id. at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a determination\nof dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n8      Pepper v.

Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness\nmust preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.\n        The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute does not say the\npetitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a\nrisk.\n        Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence.

(Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself.10 Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme. 11 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham, “three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses.\nThe trial court’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by\nsection 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of\nthe middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the\ncrime.’” (People v.

Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions.

Even after the DSL was reformed and\namended in response to Cunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection\nof the appropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute,\nestablishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect\nto certain discretionary sentencing decisions.

(Romero, supra, at pp. 529-530.) The court\nsubsequently clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do so, “the court in question\nmust consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies\nand prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background,\ncharacter, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in\nwhole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been\nconvicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams, supra, 17\nCal.4th at p. 161.)\n       Because the three strikes law was intended to restrict trial courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained:\n\n              “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it\n       carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\n       requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the\n       law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these\n       sentencing norms is both rational and proper.\n\n              “In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\n       discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited\n       circumstances. For example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial\n\n                                             19.\n\f       court was not ‘aware of its discretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the\n       court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation].\n       Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the Three Strikes law\n       may, as a matter of law,] produce[] an “arbitrary, capricious or patently\n       absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.]\n\n              “But ‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might\n       disagree about whether to strike one or more’ prior conviction allegations.\n       [Citation.] … Because the circumstances must be ‘extraordinary … by\n       which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\n       scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a\n       long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was\n       meant to attack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people\n       could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes\n       scheme must be even more extraordinary.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at p. 378.)\n       As we explained in Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1054, “The purpose of\nthe three strikes law has been variously stated as being ‘“to ensure longer prison\nsentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been\npreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses”’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Because\npublic safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject defendant’s\nassertion that a section 1170.126 proceeding is the converse of a Romero determination,\nso that any refusal to resentence an eligible inmate must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.14\n\n\n14     Because a trial court can deny resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), only upon a finding of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a trial\ncourt would abuse its discretion, as in a Romero situation, by refusing to resentence a\npetitioner because of antipathy toward the Act or a personal belief a particular defendant\ndeserved an indeterminate term for reasons other than dangerousness. (See People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 159, 161.)\n\n\n\n                                             20.\n\f       Second, defendant points to the syntax of section 1170.126, subdivision (f).\nRelying on People v.

Leaving aside\nconstitutional questions raised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without\nparole for juveniles after the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Miller v. Alabama\n(2012) 567 U.S. ___ [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959737/miller-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court stated: “It is not unreasonable to read this text … to mean that a\ncourt ‘shall’ impose life without parole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence\nof 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to\n\n\n15     Section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “The penalty for a\ndefendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more\nspecial circumstances … has been found to be true …, who was 16 years of age or older\nand under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be\nconfinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the\ndiscretion of the court, 25 years to life.”\n\n\n\n                                             21.\n\fread the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords\nwith common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take\na final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the\nstudents to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of\nsection 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended\nto make life without parole the presumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Thus, we do not agree with defendant that resentencing to a second strike\nterm is the generally mandatory disposition, subject only to circumscribed discretion to\nretain the indeterminate third strike term. A court considering whether to resentence an\neligible petitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion in\nthe sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it.\nThis does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find\ndangerousness in extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which\nsuch a finding is rational under the totality of the circumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover, a\nconclusion there is a strong presumption in favor of resentencing that will only be\novercome in an extraordinary case, due to the trial court’s circumscribed discretion,\nwould run directly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act. (See People v.\nGutierrez, supra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter\nintent in attempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].) As we stated in People v. Osuna,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of\nthe Act’ [citation].” Thus, although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars\n(People v. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw\n\n                                             22.\n\fopen the prison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for\nserious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or\nposing little or no risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038, second italics added.) Had voters\nintended to permit retention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they\nwould have said so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing\nlanguage that affords courts broad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not\nhave afforded the court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to\nthe issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute.\n                                              II\n                               THE TRIAL COURT’S RULING\n       Applying the foregoing principles to the trial court’s ruling, we find no abuse of\ndiscretion. Several of defendant’s assertions require brief discussion, however.\n       First, defendant claims that, given the “strong basis” for his past behavior in his\nmental illness coupled with substance abuse and his low intellectual ability, the trial court\n“was required to explore the possibilities of placement for [defendant] upon resentencing\nthat could be available and which could address any concerns regarding unpredictability\ndue to his mental condition and low intellectual functioning before peremptorily\nslamming the door under the Act .…” The terms of the court’s referral of the matter to\nthe probation department for a supplemental report and its consideration of the EIS report\nshow the court did indeed explore the possibilities of appropriate placement.\n       Defendant appears to recognize this fact when he says “explorative efforts had\nbeen made to identify a residential group setting to which [defendant] could be released\nin which his life would be structured and supervised and he would receive support.” He\nargues, however, that the problems found by Terrell (e.g., the likelihood defendant would\nagain abuse substances once released) would have been ameliorated if social services\ncould place defendant in a supervised, structured group home where he could be\nmonitored and receive appropriate support services. Defendant says: “That such\n\n                                              23.\n\fplacement had not yet been found at the time of the hearing here did not mean that such\nplacement was forever unavailable”; hence, the trial court “was obliged to leave such\navenue open for a reasonable time.” But the section 1170.126 hearing had to be held at\nsome point or another. Moreover, it appears, from the EIS report, that even if an\nappropriate placement could have been found, it would have taken several months for\ndefendant to be admitted, either because of space considerations or because he could not\nafford to pay until his social security benefits were reinstated, something that could not\noccur until he was released from prison. The problem here is that if defendant relapsed\n— something Terrell, an expert, felt likely if defendant were simply released back into\nthe community — there was a strong probability defendant would not merely return to\nproperty crimes, but would revert to the sort of violent behavior that had marred his past\nand resulted in him being sentenced to a third strike term in the first place. Under the\ncircumstances, we do not believe the trial court was required to resentence him and then\ncross its fingers.16\n       Defendant also contends the trial court failed to credit the evidence defendant had\nnot used alcohol or drugs for the last 15 years, despite their wide availability in prison,\nand that he was compliant with the prescribed treatment program for his mental illness.\nDefendant also says the trial court failed to consider evidence with regard to the criteria\nset out in section 1170.126, subdivision (g), such as the remoteness of defendant’s crimes\nand his low classification score. These matters were, however, all before the court\nthrough reports, the parties’ pleadings, or argument. That the court did not expressly\n\n\n16     Had defendant been resentenced, he would have been subject to mandatory PRCS\nupon release. (People v. Tubbs (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637-638.) The trial court considered the\npossibility of PRCS, however, and nothing in the record suggests such supervision would\nhave been sufficient to meet defendant’s needs so as to allay public safety concerns,\nespecially in light of Terrell’s conclusions.\n\n\n\n                                             24.\n\fmention them does not mean it failed to consider them and, in the absence of any\nshowing to the contrary, we presume it did so. (Evid. Code, § 664; see Denham v.\nSuperior Court (1970) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564; cf.

In our view, the notion that the cost\nof incarceration has some bearing on whether resentencing a particular inmate would\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is a non sequitur. Although saving\nmoney is a goal of the Act, it does not override the primary purpose of the three strikes\nlaw and the Act as a whole — the protection of public safety. (See People v. Osuna,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036-1038.) The trial court was not required to take the\ncost of continued imprisonment into account or undertake the equivalent of a cost-benefit\nanalysis in determining whether resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety; the Act already did so, and the electorate has determined\nkeeping criminals who pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety behind bars\nfor their full three strikes sentence is more important than saving money.\n                                              III\n                            SECTION 1170.18, SUBDIVISION (C)\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\n\n                                              25.\n\fpetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)17\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n17     Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                26.\n\f              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.18\n       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law.

Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                             30.\n\f       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\n\n                                             31.\n\fthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110, original italics omitted, italics\nadded.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036,\n“Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public\nsafety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\n\n\n\n                                              32.\n\fstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n\n\n\n                                             33.\n\f       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n\n                                            34.\n\f2014) L.A.

Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Because nowhere in the\nballot materials for Proposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention the definition of the\nphrase contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) would apply to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to\nalter the Act in that respect. Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all\npotential effects of a proposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter\ninformation guides containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a\nneutral explanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of\nand in opposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials\nso much as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing\nunder the Act. (Cf. Marshall v.

We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings.

Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd.

I\nagree defendant Ernest Lee Allen may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly\nenacted definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal\nCode section 1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any\nambiguity in the language used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does\nnot mean what it says, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.”\nRather, in my view, there is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c),\nintended it to apply retroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the\nThree Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen.

The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant cites In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> to argue retroactive\napplication.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\n\n\n                                             5.\n\frepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime. 2 Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.3 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                         ___________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n2For this reason, Holder v.
