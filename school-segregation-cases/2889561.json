Vallone, Hin-\nshaw & Culbertson, San Francisco, California, for the\ndefendants-appellees.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nMcKEOWN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   We are faced here with the question whether claims for\nlosses allegedly suffered at the hands of a Nazi puppet regime\nduring World War II are cognizable in our courts today.\nBecause these claims, at least superficially, touch on foreign\nrelations and potentially controversial political issues, it is\ntempting to jump to the conclusion that such claims are barred\nby the political question doctrine. The Supreme Court has\ncounseled, however, that “it is error to suppose that every case\nor controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond\njudicial cognizance.” Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211\n(1962). The justiciability inquiry is limited to “ ‘political\nquestions,’ not . . . ‘political cases,’ ” id. at 217, and should\nbe made on a “case-by-case” basis, id. at 211.\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6651\n   Although the political question doctrine often lurks in the\nshadows of cases involving foreign relations, it is infrequently\naddressed head on. See, e.g., Hwang Geum Joo v. Japan, 332\nF.3d 679, 682 (D.C. Cir. 2003), vacated and remanded by 124\nS. Ct. 2835 (2004) (explaining that because the district court\ndid not have subject matter jurisdiction in case involving\nWorld War II-era claims against Japan, “[n]or . . . need we\nconsider whether the political question doctrine would also\nbar its adjudication”). The procedural posture of this case,\nhowever, places the issue squarely before us.\n\n   With these principles in mind, in determining the threshold\nissue of justiciability, we scrutinize each claim individually.\nIndeed, in our system of separation of powers, we should not\nabdicate the court’s Article III responsibility—the resolution\nof “cases” and “controversies”—in favor of the Executive\nBranch, particularly where, as here, the Executive has\ndeclined a long-standing invitation to involve itself in the dis-\npute. We conclude that some of the claims are barred by the\npolitical question doctrine and some of the claims are justicia-\nble. Although the parties have multiple procedural and sub-\nstantive challenges to overcome down the road, they are\nentitled to their day—or years—in court on the justiciable\nclaims.\n\n   A group of twenty-four individuals and four organizations\n(the “Holocaust Survivors”) claim that the Vatican Bank,\nknown by its official title Istituto per le Opere di Religione,\nthe Order of Friars Minor, and the Croatian Liberation Move-\nment (Hrvatski Oslobodilacki Pokret), profited from the geno-\ncidal acts of the Croatian Ustasha political regime (the\n“Ustasha”), which was supported throughout World War II by\nNazi forces. That profit allegedly passed through the Vatican\nBank in the form of proceeds from looted assets and slave\nlabor. The Holocaust Survivors brought suit in federal court\nclaiming conversion, unjust enrichment, restitution, the right\nto an accounting, and human rights violations and violations\nof international law arising out of the defendants’ alleged\n\f6652                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\ninvolvement with the Ustasha during and following World\nWar II.\n\n   The Vatican Bank and the Order of Friars Minor moved to\ndismiss the Holocaust Survivors’ complaint on multiple\ngrounds; by agreement of the parties the district court limited\nits discussion to the issue of whether the Holocaust Survivors’\nclaims should be dismissed under the political question doc-\ntrine. The district court reasoned that the political question\ndoctrine bars consideration of the merits of the claims in their\nentirety. The district court dismissed the action against the\nCroatian Liberation Movement, which never appeared in the\naction, on the grounds that the claims were barred by both the\npolitical question doctrine and the lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion over this defendant. We reverse in part because certain of\nthe Holocaust Survivors’ claims—those with respect to lost\nand looted property (conversion, unjust enrichment, restitu-\ntion, and an accounting)—are not barred by this doctrine. In\ncontrast, the broad human rights allegations tied to the Vati-\ncan Bank’s alleged assistance to the war objectives of the\nUstasha present nonjusticiable controversies. Like the district\ncourt, we hold that the court did not have personal jurisdiction\nover the Croatian Liberation Movement.1 Consequently, we\nsee no reason to reach the political question doctrine vis-à-vis\nthis defendant.\n\n   Bearing in mind that “[t]he decision to deny access to judi-\ncial relief is not one we make lightly,” Liu v. Republic of\n  1\n    Even though a plaintiff need make only a prima facie showing of juris-\ndiction at this stage in a litigation, Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v. Shiv-\nnath Rai Harnarain Co., 284 F.3d 1114, 1119 (9th Cir. 2002), the\nHolocaust Survivors’ bare-bones assertions that the Croatian Liberation\nMovement has been “active” within the United States at some point and\nat least a few members have ties to this country are insufficient for us to\nconclude that the exercise of jurisdiction “does not offend ‘traditional\nnotions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ” Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washing-\nton, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457,\n463 (1940)).\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6653\nChina, 892 F.2d 1419, 1433 (9th Cir. 1989) (quoting Int’l\nAss’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. OPEC, 649 F.2d\n1354, 1360 (9th Cir. 1981)), we conclude that the political\nquestion doctrine does not create an absolute barrier to the\nHolocaust Survivors’ property claims. To conclude otherwise\nwould be to shirk our judicial role as “[c]ourts in the United\nStates have the power, and ordinarily the obligation, to decide\ncases and controversies properly presented to them.” W.S.\nKirkpatrick & Co. v. Envtl. Tectonics Corp., Int’l, 493 U.S.\n400, 409 (1990).\n\n   That said, it bears noting that our initial determination of\njusticiability in no way reflects any judgment on the threshold\nlegal hurdles that must be overcome or the merits of the\nclaims. Much of the dissent focuses on downstream issues\nrelated to potential procedural and substantive pitfalls of the\nclaims. We do not discount the difficulties that may lie ahead;\nhowever, consideration of those issues is premature. Given\nthe passage of time, the generality of the allegations, the ques-\ntion of the applicability of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct, intricacies of the alleged claims, the class certification\nissues, whether the claimants have a cognizable legal claim,\nand a myriad of other procedural and jurisdictional hurdles,\nthe Holocaust Survivors may indeed face an uphill battle in\npursuing their claims. But this spectre of difficulty down the\nroad does not inform our justiciability determination at this\nearly stage of the proceedings.\n\n   Our conclusion is rooted in the principles of Baker v. Carr.\nDespite the dissent’s cataclysmic and speculative projections\nabout the sweep of our opinion, our decision boils down to\nletting the common law property claims proceed to the next\nstage and foreclosing the political, human rights, and war-\nrelated claims. In so doing, we respect the limits of our juris-\ndiction as a national court, recognize the role of the Executive\nin foreign relations, and stick to our role of interpreting the\nlaw.\n\f6654                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.     WORLD WAR II         AND THE    USTASHA TREASURY\n\n   The events at issue relate back to the actions of the Vatican\nduring and in the years following World War II.2 Following\nGermany’s blitzkrieg through Yugoslavia in 1941, a govern-\nment composed of members of the Ustasha was proclaimed\nthe head of a protectorate of Italy. See Ustasha Treasury Report3\nat 141. The Ustasha regime was supported throughout World\nWar II by German and Italian occupation forces. Id.\n  2\n    Regarding terminology, the Vatican City and the Holy See are closely\nrelated but not interchangeable entities:\n      The term “Holy See” refers to the composite of the authority,\n      jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisers\n      to direct the worldwide Roman Catholic Church. . . . . Created in\n      1929 to provide a territorial identity for the Holy See in Rome,\n      the State of the Vatican City is a recognized national territory\n      under international law. The Holy See, however, enters into inter-\n      national agreements and receives and sends diplomatic represen-\n      tatives.\nSee U.S. Dep’t of State, Background Note: The Holy See (Oct. 2004),\navailable at http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3819.htm (“Vatican Back-\nground Note”). See generally Robert John Araujo, The International Per-\nsonality and Sovereignty of the Holy See, 50 Cath. U. L. Rev. 291 (2001)\n(providing historical overview of the Holy See’s foreign relations and\narguing that it is a subject of international law). These nuances are not crit-\nical for purposes of this opinion. Therefore, for convenience, the term\n“Vatican” will be used to refer generally to the Catholic leadership cen-\ntered in the Vatican City.\n   3\n     In the late 1990s, the U.S. Government prepared a report on the\nUstasha wartime treasury as part of a larger effort “to confront the largely\nhidden history of Holocaust-related assets after five decades of neglect.”\nBureau of Public Affairs, U.S. Dep’t of State, Pub. No. 10557, U.S. Allied\nWartime and Postwar Relations and Negotiations With Argentina, Portu-\ngal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey on Looted Gold and German External\nAssets and U.S. Concerns About the Fate of the Wartime Ustasha Trea-\nsury, Supplement to the Preliminary Study on U.S. and Allied Efforts to\nRecover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany\nDuring World War II iii (1998) (“Ustasha Treasury Report”).\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6655\n   Although the United States and its allies were aware to\nsome extent of the Ustasha’s atrocities, “It is not clear if the\nAllied leaders clearly grasped that as many as 700,000 vic-\ntims, most of them Serbs, had been killed at the Ustasha death\ncamps . . . .” Id. at 142. The State Department’s report\ndescribes the Vatican’s role in less generous terms: “The Vat-\nican, which maintained an ‘Apostolic visitor’ in Zagreb from\nJune 1941 until the end of the War, was aware of the killing\ncampaign . . . . Croatian Catholic authorities condemned the\natrocities committed by the Ustashi, but remained otherwise\nsupportive of the regime.” Id. at 143.\n\n  The connections between the Vatican and the Ustasha\nreportedly continued in the years following World War II:\n\n    With the defeat in May 1945 of Hitler and his satel-\n    lites, including puppet Croatia, the leaders of the\n    Ustasha fled to Italy, where they found sanctuary at\n    the pontifical College of San Girolamo in Rome.\n    This College was most likely funded at least in part\n    by the remnants of the Ustasha treasury, and\n    appeared to operate with at least the tacit acquies-\n    cence of some Vatican officials.\n\nId. at xviii. It is unclear to what extent the Vatican was aware\nof these activities, but the State Department is dubious that\nthey were oblivious to the Ustasha’s presence:\n\n    Although no evidence has been found to directly\n    implicate the Pope or his advisers in the postwar\n    activities of the Ustasha in Italy, it seems unlikely\n    that they were entirely unaware of what was going\n    on. Vatican authorities have told us they have not\n    found any records that could shed light on the\n    Ustasha gold question.\n\nId. at 156.\n\f6656                  ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   The size and nature of the Ustasha treasury remains in con-\nsiderable doubt. According to the State Department, “The fig-\nure of 350 million Swiss francs (over $80 million) of Ustasha\ngold that U.S. intelligence reported in 1946 remains the only\nattempt to estimate the total financial resources available to\nthe Ustashi at the end of World War II.” Id. at 150. The State\nDepartment cautions that this estimate “remains unsubstan-\ntiated and may not include some or all of the sums reported\nelsewhere.” Id.\n\nB.     THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS’ CLAIMS\n\n   This background section on the claims is drawn from the\nHolocaust Survivors’ Third Amended Class Action Complaint\n(the “Complaint”), which is detailed and lengthy and refer-\nences a number of outside sources, such as the Ustasha Trea-\nsury Report. At this stage of the proceedings, we accept the\nallegations as true. See California v. United States, 104 F.3d\n1086, 1089 (9th Cir. 1997) (when reviewing a district court’s\ngrant of a motion to dismiss, this court accepts the facts\nalleged in the complaint as true).\n\n  1.     PLAINTIFFS\n\n  The Complaint was filed on behalf of the named plaintiffs\nand the following class:\n\n       [A]ll Serbs, Jews, and former Soviet Union citizens\n       (and their heirs and beneficiaries), who suffered\n       physical, monetary and/or property losses including\n       slave labor, due to the systematic and brutal extermi-\n       nation of Jews, Serbs, and Romani by the [Ustasha],\n       and as a result of the occupation of the former Soviet\n       Union by Croatian military forces in concert with\n       their German occupation forces.\n\n  The potential class is massive: Plaintiff Ukrainian Union of\nNazi Victims And Prisoners “represents over 300,000 former\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                          6657\nslave and forced laborers, prisoners, concentration camp, and\nghetto survivors.” The geographic scope of the class is also\nfar reaching with the Ustasha’s destruction extending beyond\nCroatia to Bosnia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, includ-\ning Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.\n\n   The jurisdictional bases of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims\nare similarly expansive. They claim jurisdiction pursuant to\nthe Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350 (“ATS”), the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (“FSIA”), 28\nU.S.C. § 1331, federal common law as it incorporates custom-\nary international law and treaties, diversity jurisdiction, and\nCalifornia state law.4\n  4\n    The viability of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims apart from the issue\nof the political question doctrine is not before us. Nevertheless, looking\nahead, we note that the statutory grounds on which the Holocaust Survi-\nvors base their claims have, for the most part, not fared well in recent liti-\ngation. Just last term, the Supreme Court limited the ATS in Sosa v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 2764 (2004) (curtailing the scope of\nactionable international norms under the ATS but explaining that “the\ndoor is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping”); see also Weiss v. Am.\nJewish Comm., 335 F. Supp. 2d 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (dismissing claim\nunder the ATS for injunctive relief in connection with the construction of\na Holocaust memorial in light of the Court’s holding in Sosa). The con-\ntours of the FSIA have also changed with the Supreme Court’s holding in\nRepublic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, 124 S. Ct. 2240 (2004), that\nthe FSIA applies retroactively. See also Abrams v. Societe Nationale des\nChemins de Fer Francais, 389 F.3d 61, 64-65 (2d Cir. 2004) (dismissing\ncase for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the French govern-\nment’s acquisition of defendant railroad company immunized it from suit\nunder the FSIA). In Deutsch v. Turner Corp., 324 F.3d 692, 719 (9th Cir.\n2003), we held that a California statute on which the Holocaust Survivors’\nclaims are based in part, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 354.6, unconstitutionally\nintruded on the foreign affairs power of the federal government. We leave\nthe district court to determine in the first instance to what extent the Holo-\ncaust Survivors have correctly invoked these and other jurisdictional\nbases.\n\f6658                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n  2.    DEFENDANTS\n\n   The Complaint does not name the Vatican itself as a defen-\ndant but rather focuses on a closely related entity, the Vatican\nBank.5 The exact relationship between the Vatican and the\nVatican Bank is less than clear at this stage of the proceed-\nings. We are in no position to make a substantive judgment\nabout the nature of the Vatican Bank.6 The Complaint, which\nwe accept at face value, distinguishes between the two enti-\nties. The Vatican Bank has its principal place of business in\nthe Vatican City and is headed by a Bishop, but it conducts\ntransactions worldwide including “for-profit merchant bank-\ning transactions in the United States, California, and else-\nwhere.”\n\n   The actual dealings of the bank, however, are murky.\nIndeed, the Vatican Bank’s holdings and its specific transac-\ntions are opaque. In his declaration in support of the Holo-\ncaust Survivors’ motion for early jurisdictional discovery,\nJohn Loftus—a former prosecutor with the U.S. Department\n  5\n     The Complaint also names “Unknown Catholic Religious Orders,” a\nnumber of banking institutions (both named institutions and “Does #1-\n100”) and “unknown recipients of Nazi and Ustasha loot” as defendants.\nThe Holocaust Survivors voluntarily dismissed their claims against defen-\ndant Swiss National Bank in 2002.\n   6\n     Like its other ominous projections, the dissent jumps ahead to conclude\nthat this suit is “functionally” against “the Vatican itself” and “the Vatican\nBank, which is an instrumentality of the sovereign state of the Vatican,”\nand possibly even the Pope. Dissent at 6705. But we are nowhere near the\npoint of making such an assessment. Because this case comes to us at the\nmotion to dismiss stage, we must accept the Complaint’s demarcation\nbetween the Vatican Bank, which is named as a defendant, and the Vati-\ncan, which is not named as a defendant. Further, the potential overtones\nthat this case may have on relations with the Vatican leadership do not,\nas the dissent suggests, warrant dismissal. See Antolok v. United States,\n873 F.2d 369, 392 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (Wald, C.J., concurring in judgment\nonly) (“I read [Baker v. Carr] as a reminder that our focus should be on\nthe particular issue presented for our consideration, not the ancillary\neffects which our decision may have on political actors.”).\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6659\nof Justice’s Nazi-hunting unit—attests, “The Vatican Bank is\none of the most secretive financial institutions in the world.\nThe exact nature and ownership of the Vatican Bank is diffi-\ncult to ascertain owing to the secrecy surrounding it.”\n\n  The bank’s dealings and ownership may be shrouded in\nmystery, but the Vatican considers itself to have a stake in the\noutcome of these proceedings. In specific reference to this\ncase, the Vatican’s Secretariat of State sent a Verbal Note of\nProtest, dated October 23, 2000, to the U.S. Embassy in Rome\nrequesting as follows:\n\n    Basing itself upon the diplomatic relations which\n    exist between the United States of America and the\n    Holy See, as well as the recognition which the Gov-\n    ernment of the United States has accorded to the\n    sovereignty of the Holy See and of Vatican City\n    State, the Secretariat of State requests the interven-\n    tion of the Federal Government of the United States\n    of America.\n\n   The Order of Friars Minor joined the Vatican Bank in\nbringing the motion to dismiss. A religious brotherhood\nfounded by St. Francis Assisi, the organization includes “sev-\neral Croatian Franciscan Orders in California, the United\nStates, Croatia, and Italy.” During World War II, “Many high\nofficials of the Ustasha government were Roman Catholic\nclergy and, in particular, Franciscans.” These ties continued\nafter the war with the Order of Friars Minor providing aid to\nformer Ustasha.\n\n   Neither the district court nor the Holocaust Survivors dis-\ntinguished between the Vatican Bank and Order of Friars\nMinor in the treatment of the political question doctrine. Like-\nwise, because no distinction can be made on the basis of the\npleadings, we also address the two defendants together. For\nease of reference, from this point on in the opinion we refer\nto them collectively as the “Vatican Bank.”\n\f6660               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   The third defendant, the Croatian Liberation Movement, is\nidentified “as the successor to the Ustasha government.” The\nCroatian Liberation Movement allegedly “functioned as a\ngovernment in exile and coordinated terrorist activities in the\nUnited States and elsewhere.”\n\n  3.   CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n   The Complaint describes in detail the atrocities inflicted on\nthe Holocaust Survivors during World War II by the Ustasha\nand, more generally, by allied Fascists “believed to be Cro-\natians.” In addition to describing the looting of assets, the\nComplaint recites genocidal acts of the Ustasha, including\nthose carried out at the “Jasenovac Concentration Camp com-\nplex, termed by historians as the ‘Auschwitz of the Bal-\nkans.’ ”\n\n   Upon the collapse of the Ustasha regime in 1945, the Holo-\ncaust Survivors maintain that “all or a portion of the Ustasha\nTreasury was transferred to cooperative Roman Catholic cler-\ngyman [sic] and Franciscans for transport to Rome where\nFranciscans sympathetic to the Ustasha were based.” These\nfunds eventually found their way into the hands of the Vatican\nBank, among other recipients. As alleged in the Complaint,\n“A 1948 U.S. Army Intelligence reports [sic] confirmed 2,400\nkilos of Ustasha stolen gold were moved from the Vatican to\none of the Vatican’s secret Swiss bank accounts.” In the dec-\nades following World War II, the Holocaust Survivors con-\ntend that the Vatican Bank and the Croatian Liberation\nMovement continued to profit from transactions involving the\nUstasha treasury.\n\n  Having set forth these general allegations, the Complaint\nadvances five causes of action:\n\n  Conversion: The Holocaust Survivors first allege, “Defen-\ndants . . . have willfully and wrongfully misappropriated and\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6661\nconverted the value of [property taken from the Holocaust\nSurvivors] and its derivative profits into their own property.”\n\n   Unjust Enrichment: Second, defendants were unjustly\nenriched by “receiv[ing] stolen property given to them by\nmembers of the Ustasha Regime, which rightfully belongs to\n[the Holocaust Survivors], as well as the value of slave labor\nperformed.”\n\n   Restitution: The Holocaust Survivors allege in their third\nclaim that their “goods and property have been taken, thus\ndenying [them] the use and enjoyment thereof; Defendants\nhave wrongfully used and profited from that property.” Main-\ntaining that “compensation in damages is inadequate in that\nthe property taken cannot be replaced and the harm inflicted\ncannot be undone by mere compensation,” the Holocaust Sur-\nvivors call for “equitable remedies.”\n\n   Accounting: Fourth, the Holocaust Survivors request “the\nequitable remedy of accounting,” alleging that “Defendants\nhave never accounted for or paid the value of Plaintiffs’ prop-\nerty or the profits which Defendants have derived from that\nproperty, either during World War II or since World War II\nended.”\n\n  Human Rights Violations and Violations of International\nLaw: Finally, the Holocaust Survivors allege:\n\n    Defendants participated in the activities of the\n    Ustasha Regime in furtherance of the commission of\n    war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against\n    peace, torture, rape, starvation, physical and mental\n    abuse, summary execution and genocide. Specifi-\n    cally, the actions and conduct of Defendants, in addi-\n    tion to being profitable, actively assisted the war\n    objectives of the Ustasha Regime.\n\f6662               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nThe Complaint condemns the defendants’ aiding and abetting\nof war criminals after World War II by helping them to evade\nprosecution and to preserve the Ustasha treasury.\n\n   The Holocaust Survivors cite a multitude of legal bases for\nthese claims: “Defendants’ actions were in violation of\nnumerous international treaties and the fundamental human\nrights laws prohibiting genocide, war crimes, crimes against\nhumanity and crimes against peace. Defendants’ actions vio-\nlated customary international law . . . .” They also claim that\n“Defendants committed torts under the laws of the United\nStates, requiring Defendants to pay . . . appropriate compensa-\ntory and punitive damages for . . . injuries and losses.”\n\nC.     OVERVIEW OF THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE\n\n   Our inquiry proceeds from the age-old observation of Chief\nJustice Marshall that “[q]uestions, in their nature political, or\nwhich are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the exec-\nutive, can never be made in this court.” Marbury v. Madison,\n5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 170 (1803). Although the principle\nbehind the political question doctrine was announced over\ntwo hundred years ago in Marbury, the Supreme Court has\naddressed the doctrine in surprisingly few cases. See Atlee v.\nLaird, 347 F. Supp. 689, 693-703 (E.D. Pa. 1972) (three-\njudge court), aff’d sub nom. mem., Atlee v. Richardson, 411\nU.S. 911 (1973), (detailed “case by case” analysis of the\ndevelopment of the doctrine).\n\n   [1] In the landmark case of Baker v. Carr, the Supreme\nCourt provided its most comprehensive discussion on the\napplication of the doctrine. Recognizing that the attributes of\nthe political question doctrine “diverge, combine, appear, and\ndisappear in seeming disorderliness” in various settings, the\nCourt set out to illuminate the “contours” of the doctrine. 369\nU.S. at 210-11; see also Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional\nLaw: Principles and Policies § 2.8.1 (1997) (“In many ways,\nthe political question doctrine is the most confusing of the jus-\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                    6663\nticiability doctrines.”). The Court explained that the political\nquestion doctrine has its roots in the separation of powers and\nset forth six formulations for courts to consider in determining\nwhether they should defer a case to the political branches:\n\n    Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve\n    a political question is found [1] a textually demon-\n    strable constitutional commitment of the issue to a\n    coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judi-\n    cially discoverable and manageable standards for\n    resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding\n    without an initial policy determination of a kind\n    clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossi-\n    bility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution\n    without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate\n    branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for\n    unquestioning adherence to a political decision\n    already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrass-\n    ment from multifarious pronouncements by various\n    departments on one question.\n\n369 U.S. at 217.\n\n   [2] Dismissal on the basis of the political question doctrine\nis appropriate only if one of these formulations is “inextrica-\nble” from the case. Id. Although termed as “formulations” in\nBaker, the plurality in Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 124\nS. Ct. 1769, 1776 (2004), recently described these criteria as\n“six independent tests.” But these tests are more discrete in\ntheory than in practice, with the analyses often collapsing into\none another. See Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224, 228-29\n(1993) (describing interplay between the first and second\nBaker tests). This overlap is not surprising given the common\nunderlying inquiry of whether the very nature of the question\nis one that can properly be decided by the judiciary.\n\n  Addressing foreign affairs specifically, Baker cautioned\nagainst “sweeping statements” that imply all questions involv-\n\f6664               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\ning foreign relations are political ones. 369 U.S. at 211 (citing\nOetjen v. Cent. Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302 (1918) (“The\nconduct of the foreign relations of our Government is com-\nmitted by the Constitution to the Executive and Legislative—\n‘the political’—Departments of the Government, and the pro-\npriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political\npower is not subject to judicial inquiry or decision.”)).\nInstead, the Court instructed that courts should undertake a\ndiscriminating case-by-case analysis to determine whether the\nquestion posed lies beyond judicial cognizance. 369 U.S. at\n211. Informing this inquiry are considerations of “the history\nof [the question’s] management by the political branches,” its\n“susceptibility to judicial handling,” and “the possible conse-\nquences of judicial action.” Id. at 211-12.\n\n   Despite this caution that it is impossible to decide cases\nraising the political question doctrine “by any semantic\ncataloguing,” id. at 217, certain families of cases have\nemerged in the foreign affairs realm. See, e.g., Japan Whaling\nAss’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc’y, 478 U.S. 221, 229-31 (1986)\n(interpretation of statutes involving foreign affairs is a justi-\nciable question); Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996, 1002-04\n(1979) (four-justice plurality concluding that a challenge to\nthe President’s unilateral termination of a treaty presents a\npolitical question); Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160, 168\n(1948) (termination of war is a political question); Oetjen, 246\nU.S. at 302 (Executive’s recognition of a foreign government\nis a political question). In general, however, Baker’s admoni-\ntion has proved true that most cases involving foreign affairs\nfail to fall neatly into categories on one side or the other of\nthe justiciable/nonjusticiable line. As a result, the overarching\nBaker tests remain the starting point of our inquiry.\n\n   Following Baker, the Supreme Court has not retreated from\nthe analytical framework it established. See Vieth, 124 S. Ct.\nat 1776 (reiterating Baker formulations); Davis v. Bandemer,\n478 U.S. 109, 121-27 (1986) (reciting Baker formulations and\ndeclining Justice O’Connor’s implicit invitation to rethink\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6665\nthat approach). Subsequent decisions have elaborated on the\nvarious criteria. In particular, the Vieth plurality’s observation\nthat the Baker tests “are probably listed in descending order\nof both importance and certainty,” 124 S. Ct. at 1776, is borne\nout by the disproportionate emphasis on the first two tests in\nboth Supreme Court and lower court cases. See, e.g., Powell\nv. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 548-49 (1969) (dismissing five\nBaker formulations as inapplicable in two paragraphs after an\nextensive discussion of the first test); see also El-Shifa\nPharm. Indus. Co. v. United States, 378 F.3d 1346, 1367\n(Fed. Cir. 2004) (focusing on first Baker formulation in hold-\ning that the Constitution, “in its text and by its structure, com-\nmits to the President the power to make extraterritorial enemy\nproperty designations”); Made in the USA Found. v. United\nStates, 242 F.3d 1300, 1312-19 (11th Cir. 2001) (briefly\naddressing “prudential considerations” after analyzing the\nfirst and second Baker formulations at length in concluding\nthat the question of what constitutes a treaty is a political\nquestion); In re African-American Slave Descendants Litig.,\n304 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1056-63 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (discussing\nfirst and second Baker formulations extensively in determin-\ning that slave reparation claims were not justiciable). But see\nUnited States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385, 390-93 (1990)\n(briefly dismissing other Baker formulations after explaining\nthat mere judicial scrutiny of a congressional enactment does\nnot show a lack of respect for Congress under the fourth\nBaker formulation). Similarly, the district court in this case\naddressed only the first and second considerations and found\nthat both counseled in favor of dismissal.\n\n   Perhaps not surprisingly, our analysis also focuses on the\nfirst two considerations because they are the most significant\nin the face of the specific allegations of the Complaint. Before\nwe proceed to evaluate the Holocaust Survivors’ claims, it is\nuseful to take a short detour through the World War II Holo-\ncaust claims cases as they pertain to the political question\ndoctrine.\n\f6666                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nD.     THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE               AND   WORLD WAR\n       II-ERA CLAIMS\n\n   The late 1990s saw a flurry of legal activity over\nHolocaust-era claims after years of quietude. See Michael J.\nBazyler, Nuremberg in America: Litigating the Holocaust in\nUnited States Courts, 34 U. Rich. L. Rev. 1, 19 (2000) (“A\ntotal of ten cases involving Holocaust-era claims were filed in\nthe United States between the end of World War II and Octo-\nber 1996, the start of the new era of Holocaust-claim litiga-\ntion.”).7 The cases break down into several categories: finding\nof justiciability, finding of no justiciability, and skirting the\npolitical question doctrine or not reaching the doctrine.\n\n   The Eleventh Circuit’s recent decision involving claims\nagainst banks falls into the first category. The court held that\nclaims against two German banks that profited from the prac-\ntice of Aryanization during World War II were not political\nquestions. See Ungaro-Banages v. Dresdner Bank AG, 379\nF.3d 1227, 1235-37 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n    In contrast, the district court in this case relied heavily on\nlitigation in federal district courts in New Jersey in which the\ncourts determined that various Holocaust claims raised non-\njusticiable political questions.8 See Burger-Fischer v. Degussa\n  7\n     In addition to Michael Bazyler’s comprehensive review of Holocaust-\nera litigation, Burt Neuborne, counsel to various parties in Holocaust liti-\ngation, provides a helpful overview of the path of these cases. See Burt\nNeuborne, Preliminary Reflections on Aspects of Holocaust-era Litigation\nin American Courts, 80 Wash. U. L.Q. 795 (2002).\n   8\n     The Holocaust Survivors argue that it was improper for the district\ncourt to rely on these out-of-circuit district court cases. Although these\ncases cannot be viewed as precedent, it certainly was not improper for the\ndistrict court to reference them and consider analogous principles. See\nHart v. Massanari, 266 F.3d 1155, 1169 (9th Cir. 2001) (acknowledging\npractice of considering out-of-circuit cases when ruling on a novel issue\nof law). The Holocaust Survivors further challenge the use of these cases\nas improper in light of Deutsch. See 324 F.3d at 713 n.11. In Deutsch, we\ndid not, however, reject the New Jersey cases wholesale but rather criti-\ncized the district court for invoking the political question doctrine when\nall that was required was “the simple application of the requirements of\na treaty to which the United States is a party.” Id.\n\f                      ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                      6667\nAG, 65 F. Supp. 2d 248 (D.N.J. 1999); Iwanowa v. Ford\nMotor Co., 67 F. Supp. 2d 424 (D.N.J. 1999).9\n\n   Other courts fielding Holocaust-era claims have skirted the\npolitical question doctrine. See, e.g., Garb v. Republic of\nPoland, 72 Fed. Appx. 850, 855 n.1 (2d Cir. 2003), vacated\nand remanded by 124 S. Ct. 2835 (2004) (cautioning in\nremanding claims brought by Jews against defendant states\nand their instrumentalities that the district court’s “necessary\nfactual inquiry should be conducted with appropriate attention\nto separation-of-powers concerns, inasmuch as the conduct of\nforeign relations is delegated to the political branches, and the\nadjudication of claims that risk significant interference with\nforeign relations policy may raise justiciability concerns”)\n(citations omitted); Goldstein v. United States, No. 01-0005,\n2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19266 (D.D.C. Apr. 23, 2003) (mem-\norandum opinion) (failing to reach political question doctrine\nbecause claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity in suit by Hungarian Jews against the United States\nfor failure to take action to prevent the deaths of Jews during\nWorld War II and for recovery of stolen assets); Bodner v.\nBanque Paribas, 114 F. Supp. 2d 117, 129 n.9 (E.D.N.Y.\n2000) (explaining in case alleging French banks had failed to\nreturn assets seized during the Holocaust that the political\nquestion doctrine was “not even raised by the defendants here\nand [is] irrelevant to these facts in any event”).\n\n   Still other courts have not reached the issue because the\ncases were settled prior to ruling on the defendants’ motions\nto dismiss. See In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust\nLitig., 80 F. Supp. 2d 164 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (overseeing settle-\n  9\n    Following the district courts’ dismissals of Burger-Fischer and Iwa-\nnowa, the plaintiffs pursued expedited appeals to the Third Circuit Court\nof Appeals.

Supp. 2d 139 (E.D.N.Y.\n2000) (overseeing settlement proceedings in Swiss Bank liti-\ngation).\n\n   With these varied views as a backdrop, we turn to consider-\nation of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims.\n\n                        II.   DISCUSSION\n\n   On appeal, the Holocaust Survivors address the first, sec-\nond, and sixth Baker tests. The Vatican Bank maintains that\nthe Holocaust Survivors’ claims present political questions\nunder all of the Baker tests. Because any single test can be\ndispositive, we address each in our discussion. Just as signifi-\ncantly, while we agree with the district court that certain types\nof claims arising out of World War II are properly left to the\npolitical branches, we take a surgical approach rather than a\nbroad brush in benchmarking the Baker formulations against\nthe individual claims. It is incumbent upon us to examine\neach of the claims with particularity.\n\n   The dissent would have the political question doctrine\nremove from our courts “all matters that fall by their constitu-\ntional DNA into this sphere [of conduct involving foreign\nrelations].” Dissent at 6705. This over-inclusive approach\nthreatens to sweep all cases touching foreign relations beyond\nthe purview of the courts—a practice warned against in\nBaker. See 369 U.S. at 210-11 (“Much confusion results from\nthe capacity of the ‘political question’ label to obscure the\nneed for case-by-case inquiry.”). The Court’s emphasis in\nBaker on “the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the\nprecise facts and posture of the particular case,” id. at 217, “is\nnot merely hortatory,” McMellon v. United States, 387 F.3d\n329, 374 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (Luttig, J., dissenting). We\ntherefore decline from reflexively invoking the doctrine\nmerely because the Holocaust Survivors’ claims implicate\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                         6669\nforeign relations and instead proceed with a discriminating\ninquiry.\n\n   We conclude that the claims for conversion, unjust enrich-\nment, restitution, and an accounting10 with respect to lost and\nlooted property are not committed to the political branches\n(the “Property Claims”). Recovery for lost and looted prop-\nerty, however, stands in stark contrast to the broad allegations\ntied to the Vatican Bank’s alleged assistance to the war objec-\ntives of the Ustasha, including the slave labor claims, which\nessentially call on us to make a retroactive political judgment\nas to the conduct of war (the “War Objectives Claims”). Such\njudgment calls are, by nature, political questions. With this\nbifurcation as a framework, we first address the Property\nClaims.\n\nA.    PROPERTY CLAIMS\n\n  None of the Baker formulations are inextricable from the\nProperty Claims. Simply because a foreign bank is involved\nand the case arises out of a “politically charged” context does\nnot transform the Property Claims into political questions. See\nKadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, 249 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding\n   10\n      The Holocaust Survivors are asking the court to order the Vatican\nBank to provide the necessary information to conduct an accounting. This\nrequest contrasts with cases in which plaintiffs have asked courts to\nrequire the political branches to take action. See, e.g., Earth Island Inst.\nv. Christopher, 6 F.3d 648, 653-54 (9th Cir. 1993) (denying request that\nthe court compel the Secretary of State to initiate negotiations with foreign\nnations); see also Koohi v. United States, 976 F.2d 1328, 1332 (9th Cir.\n1992) (“Damage actions are particularly judicially manageable” whereas\n“the framing of injunctive relief may require the courts to engage in the\ntype of operational decision-making . . . constitutionally committed to\nother branches.”). It is an open question whether the Holocaust Survivors\nwill be able to gain access to the information needed for an accounting\nwithout diplomatic intervention considering that “[a] full accounting of the\nevents of the Ustasha period . . . has to be found in the archives of other\nnations and possibly the Vatican.” Ustasha Treasury Report, supra note 3,\nat 154.\n\f6670              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nthat political question doctrine did not bar adjudication of\nclaims brought under the ATS against a Bosnian-Serb leader\nfor committing genocide and other atrocities).\n\n   As these excerpts from the Complaint demonstrate, the\nProperty Claims consist of garden-variety legal and equitable\nclaims for the recovery of property:\n\n    •   “Looted Assets” is defined in the Complaint as\n        including, inter alia, “cash, securities, silver,\n        gold, jewelry, businesses, art masterpieces,\n        equipment and intellectual property” that were\n        improperly taken by any person or entity acting\n        in furtherance of the Nazi or Ustasha regime.\n\n    •   The second largest apparel factory in Yugoslavia\n        was confiscated from the family of plaintiff Fred\n        Zlatko Harris, including “50 advanced industrial\n        Singer sewing machines.” The family’s invest-\n        ment real estate, car, and motorcycle were also\n        confiscated by Ustasha forces.\n\n    •   The “Ustasha and Germans” looted property\n        “valued by the Tito government in 1948 in excess\n        of $1,500,000 in prewar dollars” from the textile\n        manufacturing assets of plaintiff Allen Dolfi\n        Herskovich’s family.\n\n    •   Plaintiff Desa Tomasevic Wakeman describes\n        how “money and other belongings including\n        gold” were taken from her mother and grand-\n        mother by Ustasha forces.\n\n    •   The looted assets were collected from a wide\n        geographic area, with “[t]he Ustasha Treasury\n        contain[ing] plunder from Ukraine and assets\n        seized from the Ustasha victims in Yugoslavia.”\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                    6671\n       •    The Complaint lists whether the Vatican Bank\n            “improperly retained or converted looted assets”\n            belonging to the Holocaust Survivors as one of\n            the common questions of fact for the proposed\n            class.\n\n       •    The Vatican Bank was unjustly enriched by “re-\n            ceiv[ing] stolen property given to [it] by mem-\n            bers of the Ustasha Regime.” The Holocaust\n            Survivors further seek restitution for their “goods\n            and property” that the Vatican Bank “wrongfully\n            used and profited from.”\n\n       •    The Holocaust Survivors request that the court\n            direct the Vatican Bank “to return all identifiable\n            property looted from Plaintiffs and received by\n            Defendants” and pay “the value [plus interest] of\n            any identified property deposited by, or looted\n            from, Plaintiffs and received by Defendants.”\n\n  1.       TEXTUALLY DEMONSTRABLE COMMITMENT\n\n   [3] Beginning logically with the first Baker test, we divine\nno explicit constitutional reference that is applicable to this\ncase. Cf. Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 5-11 (1973) (noting\nthe Constitution’s explicit vesting of power in Congress to\n“organiz[e] . . . the Militia” in holding that a suit seeking to\nrestrain the Governor’s use of National Guard troops pre-\nsented political questions). More often, however, “there are\nfew, if any, explicit and unequivocal instances in the Consti-\ntution of this sort of textual commitment. . . . The courts\ntherefore are usually left to infer the presence of a political\nquestion from the text and structure of the Constitution.”\nNixon, 506 U.S. at 240-41 (White, J., concurring). In Nixon,\nthe Court undertook an expansive review of the history of the\nImpeachment Trial Clause in concluding that the language\nand structure of the Constitution textually commits impeach-\nment determinations to the Senate. Id. at 233-36; see also\n\f6672                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nPowell, 395 U.S. at 520-48 (1969) (engaging in a similarly\nextensive review of the text and history behind the expulsion\npower in Article I, Section 5, to discern whether it grants\nCongress judicially unreviewable power to set qualifications\nof membership).\n\n   Here we are not faced with analyzing a specific clause of\nthe Constitution but rather proceed from the understanding\nthat the management of foreign affairs predominantly falls\nwithin the sphere of the political branches and the courts con-\nsistently defer to those branches. See, e.g., Am. Ins. Ass’n v.\nGaramendi, 539 U.S. 396, 422 n.12 (2003) (“[I]n the field of\nforeign policy, the President has the ‘lead role.’ ”) (quoting\nFirst Nat’l City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba, 406 U.S.\n759, 767 (1972)); Oetjen, 246 U.S. at 302 (emphasizing that\nthe conduct of foreign relations is committed to the political\nbranches and is not subject to judicial inquiry); Mingtai Fire\n& Marine Ins. Co. v. United Parcel Service, 177 F.3d 1142,\n1144 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. Pink, 315 U.S.\n203, 222-23 (1942)) (“[T]he conduct of foreign relations is\ncommitted by the Constitution to the political departments of\nthe Federal Government; [and] . . . the propriety of the exer-\ncise of that power is not open to judicial review.”). Notwith-\nstanding this general commitment of foreign relations to the\npolitical branches, in Baker, the Court cautioned that whether\na court should defer to the political branches is a case-by-case\ninquiry because “it is error to suppose that every case or con-\ntroversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial\ncognizance.” 369 U.S. at 211.\n\n   Our inquiry is further based on the premise that, unlike\nsome World War II-era claims, the Holocaust Survivors’\nclaims are not expressly barred by treaty.11 U.S. Const. art. II,\n  11\n     The dissent suggests that the Treaty of Peace with Italy, Feb. 10, 1947,\nart. 75, 61 Stat. 1245, 1400-01, controls this case. See Dissent at 6709-10.\nThis emphasis is misplaced. The treaty was concluded with Italy, not the\nVatican. See Vatican Background Note, supra note 2 (“Lateran Pacts con-\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                         6673\n§ 2, cl. 1 (granting the President the power to make treaties);\nsee, e.g., In re World War II Era Japanese Forced Labor\nLitig., 114 F. Supp. 2d 939, 945 (N.D. Cal. 2000), aff’d,\nDeutsch v. Turner Corp., 324 F.3d 692 (9th Cir. 2003), (deter-\nmining that the 1951 Peace Treaty with Japan essentially pre-\ncludes all claims arising out of actions taken by Japan and its\nnationals during World War II).\n\n   Nor are the Holocaust Survivors’ claims against the Vati-\ncan Bank the subject of an executive agreement. See Gara-\nmendi, 539 U.S. at 415-16 (“Historically, wartime claims\nagainst even nominally private entities have become issues in\ninternational diplomacy, and three of the postwar settlements\ndealing with reparations implicating private parties were\nmade by the Executive alone.”); Dames & Moore v. Regan,\n453 U.S. 654, 680 (1981) (“Crucial to our decision today is\nthe conclusion that Congress has implicitly approved the prac-\ntice of claim settlement by executive agreement.”).\n\n   In other circumstances, the Executive Branch has taken for-\nmal steps to intervene in certain claims arising out of the\nHolocaust. Most notably, the United States and Germany\nsigned an executive agreement in July 2000 in which Ger-\nmany agreed to enact legislation establishing a foundation\n(the “Foundation”) to oversee the compensation of those\n“who suffered at the hands of German companies during the\nNational Socialist era and World War II.” Agreement Con-\ncerning the Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and\n\nfirming independence and sovereignty of The Holy See signed with Italy\non February 11, 1929.”). Further, as previously noted, because this case\ncomes to us at the motion to dismiss stage, we must accept the Com-\nplaint’s demarcation between the Vatican Bank, which is named as a\ndefendant, and the Vatican, which is not named as a defendant. To the\nextent further discovery resolves the legal and political status of the Vati-\ncan bank vis-à-vis the Vatican and/or Italy, the treaty could have some\nbearing. At this juncture, however, it is not applicable to the claims as\nplead.\n\f6674                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nthe Future,” July 17, 2000, U.S.-F.R.G., 39 I.L.M. 1298, 1298\n(“Foundation Agreement”);12 see also Garamendi, 539 U.S. at\n405-08 (describing the Foundation Agreement and similar\nagreements concluded with Austria and France).\n\n   The Holocaust Survivors’ case is distinguishable from\nthose involving the Foundation in that there is no analogous\nexecutive agreement covering claims to the Ustasha treasury.\nDespite the dearth of formalized accords, the Vatican Bank\ncounters—and the district court agreed—that the absence of\nan agreement covering the Holocaust Survivors’ claims is not\ndispositive of the issue. We agree. The question then comes\nback to whether the Property Claims are the type of claims\ncommitted to the political branches for resolution.\n\n   [4] We do not have much guidance in evaluating the nature\nof the non-treaty, non-executive agreement claims. At bottom,\nthe Property Claims simply seek restitution for looted assets\nbelonging to purported class members. Reparation for steal-\ning, even during wartime, is not a claim that finds textual\ncommitment in the Constitution.\n\n  The Holocaust Survivors do not, for example, seek back\nrent due a New York landlord from a country whose diplo-\n  12\n     Courts have been inconsistent as to whether the Foundation Agree-\nment precludes private litigation. Compare Ungaro-Banages, 379 F.3d at\n1235 (explaining in holding that the political question doctrine did not act\nas a bar that “the plain text of the Foundation Agreement anticipates that\nfederal courts will consider claims against German corporations”) with In\nre Nazi Era Cases Against German Defendants Litig., 334 F. Supp. 2d\n690, 696-97 (D.N.J. 2004) (holding claim against German company aris-\ning out of so-called Nazi “medical experiments” was nonjusticiable on the\nbasis of “[t]he history of foreign policy commitments devoted to the reso-\nlution of Holocaust-era claims, coupled with the relatively recent creation\nof the Foundation”); see also Neuborne, supra note 7, at 824 n.101\n(“[The] precatory Statement of Interest [called for in the Foundation\nAgreement] has no preclusive effect. It leaves to the discretion of an Arti-\ncle III court whether additional Holocaust-era litigation should be enter-\ntained.”).\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                6675\nmats were expelled from the United States, 767 Third Ave.\nAssocs. v. Consulate Gen. of the Socialist Fed.

Supp. 2d 251 (D.D.C. 2004), or\nquestion the recognition of a foreign government, Antolok,\n873 F.2d at 379-85.\n\n   Instead, the claims here bear more similarities to the prop-\nerty claims considered by the Supreme Court last year in Alt-\nmann. See 124 S. Ct. at 2243. Altmann brought suit against\nAustria and its national art gallery seeking to recover six\nKlimt paintings that were allegedly wrongfully obtained by\nthe gallery after Nazi forces seized them during World War\nII. Id. The Court granted certiorari on the limited question of\nwhether the FSIA applies retroactively, id., and did not\naddress the political question doctrine. Nonetheless, that the\nCourt allowed the case to proceed underscores that courts\nhave a place in deciding Holocaust-era claims concerning\nlooted assets. Cf. Rosner v. United States, 231 F. Supp. 2d\n1202, 1204 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (denying motion to dismiss, in\npart, in case alleging that the United States seized valuables\nbelonging to Hungarian Jews after World War II).\n\n  Significantly, the United States itself brought an action in\nfederal district court in New York seeking civil forfeiture of\na painting that the United States claimed was about to be\nexported in violation of the National Stolen Property Act. See\nUnited States v. Portrait of Wally, No. 99 Civ. 9940, 2002\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 6445 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2002). “Wally,”\nwhich was on loan from a museum in Austria, was taken from\n\f6676               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nvictims of the Holocaust during World War II. Id. at *6. The\ncourt rejected Austria’s argument, as amicus curiae, that the\ncourt should not hear the case because of the political ques-\ntion doctrine. Id. at *38 (determining that none of the six\nBaker formulations was present). Although the claim was in\nrem in nature, rather than for damages, the consideration\nunder Baker’s first test is the same.\n\n   [5] As with Portrait of Wally and Altmann, the Property\nClaims ultimately boil down to whether the Vatican Bank is\nwrongfully holding assets. Deciding this sort of controversy\nis exactly what courts do. The presence of a foreign defendant\nwith some relationship to a foreign government and claims\nstemming from World War II atrocities tinge this case with\npolitical overtones, but the underlying property issues are not\n“political questions” that are constitutionally committed to the\npolitical branches.\n\n   The dissent’s rhetoric aside, the question here is whether\nthe suit should be stopped dead because of the political ques-\ntion doctrine. If Judge Trott contests the broad jurisdiction of\nU.S. courts to hear suits involving foreigners, or the scope of\nthe FSIA—issues that are not even presented at this stage of\nthe proceeding—then his recourse is with Congress, not a\nquarrel with the majority. Our holding does not, as the dissent\ncontends, “extend[ ] the concept of judicial authority into\nunknown territory and mistakenly exercise[ ] power and com-\npetence that plainly belongs to the President and to Con-\ngress.” Dissent at 6715-16. Nor does it raise the spectre of a\n“World Court . . . with breathtaking and limitless jurisdiction\nto entertain the World’s failures.” Dissent at 6712. Rather, we\nhold true to a fundamental principle behind our separation of\npowers design, namely that “[i]t is emphatically the province\nand duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”\nMarbury, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177. Because the Property\nClaims do not raise questions “entrusted to one of the political\nbranches or involv[ing] no judicially enforceable rights,”\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                         6677\nVieth, 124 S. Ct. at 1776, we fulfill our duty to say what the\nlaw is.\n\n  2.    JUDICIALLY         DISCOVERABLE           AND       MANAGEABLE\n        STANDARDS\n\n   The Supreme Court discussed the second Baker test at\nlength last term in Vieth. The plurality explained that political\ngerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable because no judi-\ncially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating\nsuch claims exist: “One of the most obvious limitations\nimposed by that requirement is that judicial action must be\ngoverned by standard, by rule.” 124 S. Ct. at 1777. In\nresponse to Justice Kennedy’s concern that the plurality’s\ndecision was premature,13 Justice Scalia replied, “But it is the\nfunction of the courts to provide relief, not hope.” Id. at 1791.\nThe crux of this inquiry is thus not whether the case is unman-\nageable in the sense of being large, complicated, or otherwise\ndifficult to tackle from a logistical standpoint. Rather, courts\nmust ask whether they have the legal tools to reach a ruling\nthat is “principled, rational, and based upon reasoned distinc-\ntions.” Id. at 1777.\n\n  In conducting this inquiry, the refusal of five Justices in\nVieth to hold that no manageable standard existed despite\nwhat the plurality termed “[e]ighteen years of essentially\n  13\n     Abiding by the rule that when “no single rationale explaining the\nresult enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be\nviewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the\njudgments on the narrowest grounds,” Marks v. United States, 430 U.S.\n188, 193 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted), we treat the position\nenunciated in Justice Kennedy’s concurrence as controlling. Although\nagreeing with the majority that the Court should refrain from intervention\nin the case at bar, Justice Kennedy declined to join the plurality in holding\nthat all political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable. Vieth, 124\nS. Ct. at 1793 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“I would not foreclose all possi-\nbility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to\ncorrect an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting\ncases.”).\n\f6678               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\npointless litigation,” id. at 1792, counsels against holding a\ncase nonjusticiable under the second Baker test without first\nundertaking an exhaustive search for applicable standards. See\nid. at 1795-96 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (calling for “err[ing]\non the side of caution” in refraining from concluding that no\nmanageable standards will emerge in the future). As Justice\nGinsburg optimistically wrote, although “courts have been\ntrying to devise practical criteria for political gerrymandering\nfor nearly 20 years” without reaching a workable solution, “I\ndo not accept it as sound counsel for despair.” Id. at 1815-16\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n\n   The district court determined that the second Baker test\nrequired dismissal, explaining that the Holocaust Survivors’\ncase presents “intractable problems,” including the task of\nidentifying and notifying potential class members, the “multi-\ntude of sources” from which relevant materials would be\ngathered, and the likelihood that the parties would be able to\ngather all of the “pertinent data.” It is not surprising that the\ndistrict court zeroed in on “manageable standards” for decid-\ning the case. The Baker language is not crystal clear in this\nregard and, understandably, other courts have similarly\nfocused on case management. See, e.g., Iwanowa, 67\nF. Supp. 2d at 488-89 (“[T]he relevant materials come from a\nmultitude of sources, which . . . are voluminous and poten-\ntially unmanageable for individual courts to handle.”)\n\n   Lest there be any doubt, Vieth refines and redirects the\ninquiry. In light of the Court’s clarification in Vieth, we take\na slightly different approach to interpreting the phrase “judi-\ncially discoverable and manageable standards.” Instead of\nfocusing on the logistical obstacles, we ask whether the courts\nare capable of granting relief in a reasoned fashion or, on the\nother hand, whether allowing the Property Claims to go for-\nward would merely provide “hope” without a substantive\nlegal basis for a ruling. See Vieth, 124 S. Ct. at 1791. We con-\nclude that there are sound bases for providing relief.\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6679\n   The Holocaust Survivors’ most straightforward claims\ninvolve identifiable personal property for which federal stat-\nutes, common law, state law, and well-established case law\nprovide concrete legal bases for courts to reach a reasoned\ndecision. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(3) (providing an\nexpropriation exception to sovereign immunity in certain\ncases involving “rights in property taken in violation of inter-\nnational law”); Altmann, 124 S. Ct. at 2245 (asserting juris-\ndiction under the FSIA’s expropriation exception for return of\nartwork taken by Nazi forces); Gruber v. Pac. States Sav. &\nLoan Co., 88 P.2d 137, 139 (Cal. 1939) (“It is settled that\nconversion is any act of dominion wrongfully exerted over\nanother’s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with\nhis rights therein.”).\n\n   [6] Altmann involved six paintings that were linked to a\nsingle plaintiff through an imperfect, but at least fairly well\ndocumented, chain of ownership. More difficult is tracking\ngold, silver, and other fungible assets, like money, especially\nthose without bank account records or other reliable docu-\nmentation. We are well aware that the Holocaust Survivors\nhave a difficult task ahead of them in establishing the path\nthat the looted funds followed. See Ustasha Treasury Report,\nsupra note 3, at 154-55 (“The Croatian delegation [at the Lon-\ndon Conference on Nazi Gold held in December 1997] stated\nthat there were 22 lists specifying the gold [of the Ustasha],\nbut the lists have not been found, and further documentation\nregarding the gold was assumed to be with the National Bank\nof Yugoslavia.”); id. at 155 (“There is some evidence that at\nleast part of the Croat Foreign Ministry archives was sent to\nthe Vatican at the end of the War.”). These looming evidenti-\nary and proof obstacles do not change the fact that, at heart,\nthe Holocaust Survivors seek compensation for stolen prop-\nerty, a claim that is very familiar in our courts. Cf. Klinghoffer\nv. S.N.C. Achille Lauro, 937 F.2d 44, 49 (2d Cir. 1991) (con-\ncluding that the second Baker test did not act as a bar in case\nagainst the Palestine Liberation Organization “because the\n\f6680               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\ncommon law of tort provides clear and well-settled rules on\nwhich the district court can easily rely”).\n\n   It would be premature for us to foreclose the Holocaust\nSurvivors’ claims because of such impending hurdles: The\nsecond Baker prong is not a proxy for the class certification\nanalysis. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. As with every prospective\nclass action, this one must pass through the Rule 23 filter, a\nprocess that could preclude the class or perhaps result in the\nreshaping of the class or in some other modification of the\ndispute. Concerns about class composition and size, as well as\nquestions about access to relevant documents, should be left\nto Rule 23 proceedings and the discovery process.\n\n   Accordingly, the district court was misplaced in its reliance\non the somewhat anachronistic Kelberine v. Societe Interna-\ntionale, 363 F.2d 989 (D.C. Cir. 1966), to support the view\nthat the Holocaust Survivors’ claims present “intractable\nproblems” that defy manageable judicial resolution. In Kel-\nberine, the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the dismissal\nof World War II-era claims against a Swiss holding corpora-\ntion “for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.” 363 F.2d at 995. Without mentioning the political\nquestion doctrine, the court explained, “The procedure sought\n—adjudication of some two hundred thousand claims for mul-\ntifarious damages inflicted twenty to thirty years ago in a\nEuropean area by a government then in power—is too com-\nplicated, too costly, to justify undertaking by a court without\nlegislative provision of the means wherewith to proceed.” Id.\nMost significantly, Kelberine does not address the second\nBaker test. Nor can Kelberine serve as a guide to logistical\ninfringement.\n\n   Since Kelberine was decided in 1966, the class action land-\nscape has changed dramatically. Coincidentally, this same\nyear marked the emergence of “modern class action practice,”\nOrtiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 833 (1999), with the\n“innovative 1966 revision” to Rule 23, Amchem Prods., Inc.\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                 6681\nv. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997). Kelberine was also\ndecided prior to creation of the Manual for Complex Litiga-\ntion which, first published in 1969, is now in its fourth incar-\nnation. See Fed. Judicial Ctr., Manual For Complex\nLitigation, Fourth (2004). This manual offers “an array of liti-\ngation management techniques and procedures,” and recog-\nnizes that due to the presence of much “sparsely charted\nterrain[,] . . . judges are encouraged to be innovative and cre-\native to meet the needs of their cases.” Id. at 2-3.\n\n   While acknowledging the innovative and creative means\nthat the judiciary has employed to tackle class actions, we are\nwell aware that this is a behemoth of a case. Even so, courts\nhave repeatedly risen to the challenge of handling cases\ninvolving international elements as well as massive, complex\nclass actions. See generally Kenneth R. Feinberg, Reporting\nFrom the Front Line — One Mediator’s Experience With\nMass Torts, 31 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 359, 371 (1998) (discussing\n“some of the practical problems which arise in attempting to\nresolve [mass tort] litigation and the pragmatic solutions\noffered to deal with these problems”). Courts also have fash-\nioned innovative solutions to surmount similar obstacles in\nthe Holocaust-claims context. See, e.g., D’Amato v. Deutsche\nBank, 236 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 2001) (explaining in class\naction against German and Austrian banks that “the notice\ncampaign also utilized newspaper advertisements, direct mail-\ning to organizations throughout the world, and a world wide\nweb home page”); In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., 105\nF. Supp. 2d at 147 (noting in context of reviewing settlement\nagreement that “some 550,000 Initial Questionnaires had been\nreceived from class members worldwide”). Our conclusion\nthat this case is judicially “manageable” does not diminish our\nunderstanding that burdening a district court with a case of\nthis magnitude and complexity may prove to present a Sisy-\nphean task: Just when the court appears to be making progress\ntowards reaching legal peace, the rock rolls back down and\nthe court must tackle the next issue.\n\f6682               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   [7] The Holocaust Survivors unrealistically “anticipate that\nthere will be no difficulty in the management of this litiga-\ntion.” Of course there will be litigation management difficul-\nties, but that does not mean that courts “lack . . . judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards” for resolving the\nProperty Claims. Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. Concerns about\nclass certification, discovery, and allocation, among other\nissues, are matters to be resolved at a later time. Today we\nconclude only that a legal framework exists by which courts\ncan evaluate these claims in a reasoned manner.\n\fALPERIN v.

INITIAL POLICY DETERMINATION\n\n   [8] Nor do we think that adjudicating the Property Claims\nwill be impossible “without [making] an initial policy deter-\nmination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.” Baker,\n369 U.S. at 217. The Property Claims focus on the extent to\nwhich the Holocaust Survivors were wrongfully deprived of\npersonal property and the value of such property that was\ntransferred to the Vatican Bank. Adjudicating these discrete\nissues will not require the court to make pronouncements on\nforeign policy or otherwise trigger the third Baker test. Cf.\nAktepe, 105 F.3d at 1404 (wrongful death claims arising out\nof a NATO training exercise raised nonjusticiable political\nquestions in part because a decision would require “a policy\ndetermination regarding the necessity of simulating actual\nbattle conditions”).\n\n4.        LACK OF RESPECT FOR COORDINATE BRANCHES\n\n   The fourth Baker test requires us to consider whether it\nwould be impossible for the courts to resolve the Property\nClaims without expressing a lack of respect for the political\nbranches. See Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. As evidenced by the\nVatican’s protest to the State Department, this case implicates\nforeign relations. Whether the court’s involvement would\ninevitably express a lack of respect for the Executive\nBranch’s handling of U.S.-Vatican relations,14 as well as rela-\ntions with other foreign states, is a separate matter.15 We con-\nclude that judicial handling of the Property Claims will not\nrun afoul of this fourth test.\n     14\n     The United States and the Vatican established diplomatic relations on\nJanuary 10, 1984. Vatican Background Note, supra note 2.\n  15\n     In addition to relations with the Vatican, we recognize that, theoreti-\ncally, this case could bear on the United States’ relationship with Croatia,\nas well as other countries. But this theoretical possibility—even if com-\nmon sense—does not dictate the confines of a political question.\n\f6688                ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   More than four years have passed since the Vatican sent its\nprotest to the State Department. The Holocaust Survivors rep-\nresented to the court that the State Department has been\napprised of this appeal but has said that its decision not to\nintervene is not reflective of its view on the merits of this\ncase.\n\n   [9] Had the State Department expressed a view, that fact\nwould certainly weigh in evaluating this fourth Baker formu-\nlation. In Altmann, the Court explained that “should the State\nDepartment choose to express its opinion on the implications\nof exercising jurisdiction over particular petitioners in con-\nnection with their alleged conduct, that opinion might well be\nentitled to deference as the considered judgment of the Execu-\ntive on a particular question of foreign policy.” 124 S. Ct. at\n2255 (footnote omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. § 517 (“The\nSolicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice,\nmay be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district\nin the United States to attend to the interests of the United\nStates in a suit pending in a court of the United States . . . .”).\nIt is unclear, however, how courts should construe executive\nsilence. We are not mind readers. And, thus, we cannot dis-\ncern whether the State Department’s decision not to intervene\nis an implicit endorsement, an objection, or simple indiffer-\nence. At best, this silence is a neutral factor.\n\n   A few weeks after Altmann was decided, the Supreme\nCourt considered “a policy of case-specific deference to the\npolitical branches” as a possible limitation on the determina-\ntion whether an international norm is sufficiently definite to\nsupport a cause of action. Sosa, 124 S. Ct. at 2766 n.21. The\nCourt saw no need to apply this policy in Sosa. Nonetheless,\nthe Court pointed to “several class actions” pending in federal\ndistrict court seeking damages from corporations in connec-\ntion with South Africa’s former apartheid regime. Id. (citing\nIn re South African Apartheid Litig., 238 F. Supp. 2d 1379\n(J.P.M.L. 2002) (granting a motion to transfer the cases to the\nSouthern District of New York)). In the South Africa cases,\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                 6689\nthe State Department filed a statement in support of South\nAfrica’s position that the cases interfered with the policy\nembodied by its Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 124\nS. Ct. at 2766 n.21. The Court concluded, “In such cases,\nthere is a strong argument that federal courts should give seri-\nous weight to the Executive Branch’s view of the case’s\nimpact on foreign policy.” Id.\n\n   Such case-specific intervention is not uncommon in cases\ninvolving foreign affairs. See Sarei v. Rio Tinto PLC, 221\nF. Supp. 2d 1116, 1179-80 (C.D. Cal 2002) (listing numerous\nexamples where the Executive Branch submitted its opinion\nin cases involving foreign affairs). In the Holocaust-era\nclaims context, the United States agreed as part of the Foun-\ndation Agreement that whenever a German company was\nsued in a U.S. court over a Holocaust-era claim, the U.S. Gov-\nernment would submit a statement that foreign policy interests\nrecommend recognition of the Foundation as the exclusive\nforum for such claims and “that U.S. policy interests favor\ndismissal on any valid legal ground.” Foundation Agreement,\n39 I.L.M. at 1304. The United States stopped short, however,\nof expressly precluding all claims. See Garamendi, 539 U.S.\nat 436 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“The [Foundation] agree-\nment makes clear, however, that ‘the United States does not\nsuggest that its policy interests concerning the Foundation in\nthemselves provide an independent legal basis for dismiss-\nal.’ ”) (quoting Foundation Agreement, 39 I.L.M. at 1304).\nCourts have varied in their interpretation of the amount of\ndeference these statements merit. Compare Ungaro-Benages,\n379 F.3d at 1236 n.12 (statement of interest filed by U.S.\nGovernment under the Foundation Agreement is “entitled to\ndeference, [but] does not make the litigation non-justiciable”)\nwith Frumkin v. JA Jones, Inc. (In re Nazi Era Cases Against\nGerman Defendants Litig.), 129 F. Supp. 2d 370, 388-89\n(D.N.J. 2001) (“If [the statement of interest filed by U.S.\nGovernment under the Foundation Agreement] does not\nclearly demonstrate that the claims against German Industry\npresently before the Court constitute political questions best\n\f6690               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nleft to the political branches, it is unclear to the Court what\nwould.”). Here, we are not even faced with evaluating the\nState Department’s position because the Department has\nissued no statement in this case.\n\n   [10] Nor does allowing the Holocaust Survivors’ claims to\nproceed mean that the political branches will be shut out from\nhaving any input as the case develops. As a State Department\nDeputy Legal Adviser explained: “Whether the U.S. Govern-\nment agrees to facilitate the resolution of [future Holocaust-\nera disputes that are between private parties], will be, I think,\na case-by-case decision, based on a judgement of the United\nStates government interests involved in the circumstances\npresented.” Ronald J. Bettauer, The Role of the United States\nGovernment In Recent Holocaust Claims Resolution, Keynote\nAddress at the Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium 2001 (Mar.\n8-9, 2001), in 20 Berkeley J. Int’l L. 1, 10 (2002). Such gov-\nernment involvement is not limited to a specified period dur-\ning the judicial process, such as the motion to dismiss stage.\nCf. Kadic, 70 F.3d at 250 (describing statement of interest\nfiled by the government after oral argument on appeal).\nAccordingly, going forward, we respect the political\nbranches’ right to weigh in and to play a role in the resolution\nof the Holocaust Survivors’ claims. See generally Neuborne,\nsupra note 7, at 796 (analogizing process of resolving\nHolocaust-era claims to a “three-legged stool” made up of\nclass action litigation, diplomacy, and community involve-\nment). Given the Executive Branch’s continuing silence on\nthe Holocaust Survivors’ claims, however, we follow Sosa’s\nlead that at this time “we need not apply here . . . a policy of\ncase-specific deference to the political branches.” 124 S. Ct.\nat 2766 n.21.\n\n   This case will proceed with foreign relations considerations\nas a backdrop, and the district court should and “can consider\nthe nation’s foreign policy interests and international comity\nconcerns in [its] decisions.” Ungaro-Banages, 379 F.3d at\n1237; see also Abu Ali v. Ashcroft, 350 F. Supp. 2d 28, 65\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6691\n(D.D.C. 2004) (refusing to dismiss case but commenting that\nthe court “will carefully construct the future course of this\nproceeding” bearing “concerns founded in the principles of\nthe political question, separation of powers, and act of state\ndoctrines firmly in mind”). Despite these delicate consider-\nations, the district court is fully capable of resolving the Prop-\nerty Claims without expressing a lack of respect for the\npolitical branches.\n\n  5.   ADHERENCE TO A POLICY DECISION\n\n   [11] We see no concern that judicial handling of the Prop-\nerty Claims will involve “an unusual need for unquestioning\nadherence to a political decision already made.” Baker, 369\nU.S. at 217; cf. Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 50 (concluding that\nthe fifth Baker test did not bar adjudication “because no prior\npolitical decisions are questioned—or even implicated—by\nthe matter before us”). Indeed, this case is before us not\nbecause the Holocaust Survivors disagree with a political\ndecision made regarding their claims, but rather because there\nsimply has been no decision. See Northrop Corp. v. McDon-\nnell Douglas Corp., 705 F.2d 1030, 1047 (9th Cir. 1983)\n(adjudicating case would not require the court to “challenge\nthe wisdom or legality of any governmental act or decision”).\nBecause of the lack of a policy decision on point, we do not\nreach the question posed by the fifth Baker test whether there\nis an “unusual need for unquestioning adherence” thereto.\nBaker, 369 U.S. at 217.\n\n  6.   MULTIFARIOUS PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n   [12] The only question remaining is whether adjudicating\nthe Property Claims would “cause the potentiality of embar-\nrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various\ndepartments on one question.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 217; see\nalso Japan Whaling Ass’n., 478 U.S. at 230 (rejecting argu-\nment that the Court should defer adjudication on the basis of\nthe sixth Baker test). On the contrary, this case is marked by\n\f6692               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nthe absence of “pronouncements” by the political branches\nregarding the resolution of claims to the Ustasha treasury.\n\n    We reject the Vatican Bank’s argument that despite this\nvacuum, any adjudication of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims\nwould cause potential embarrassment because it would be\ninconsistent with the political branches’ stated intent to\nresolve claims arising out of World War II by way of inter-\ngovernmental negotiations and diplomacy. See Garamendi,\n539 U.S. at 421 (explaining that the “consistent Presidential\nforeign policy has been to encourage European governments\nand companies to volunteer settlement funds in preference to\nlitigation or coercive sanctions”).\n\n   [13] We are mindful of stepping on the toes of the political\nbranches, but we disagree that any adjudication of the claims\nwould implicate this final test. As discussed with regard to the\nWar Objectives Claims, the district court should refrain from\nhearing those claims that require passing judgment on foreign\npolicy decisions. On the other hand, fulfilling our\nconstitutionally-mandated role to hear controversies properly\nbefore us does not threaten to cause embarrassment or multi-\nple pronouncements. Cf. Johnson v. Collins Entm’t Co., 199\nF.3d 710, 729 (4th Cir. 1999) (Luttig, J., concurring in the\njudgment) (“If the Congress sees fit to provide citizens with\na particular cause of action, then we as federal courts should\nentertain that action—and unbegrudgingly.”).\n\n   In the landscape before us, this lawsuit is the only game in\ntown with respect to claimed looting and profiteering by the\nVatican Bank. No ongoing government negotiations, agree-\nments, or settlements are on the horizon. The outside chance\nthat the Executive Branch will issue a statement in the future\nthat has the “potentiality of embarrassment” when viewed\nagainst our decision today does not justify foreclosing the\nHolocaust Survivors’ claims, especially when “[t]he age and\nhealth of many of the class members also presses for a prompt\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                         6693\nresolution.” In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., 105\nF. Supp. 2d at 148.\n\n   [14] In sum, none of the Baker formulations is “inextrica-\nble” from the Property Claims. See Baker, 369 U.S. at 217.\nThe Holocaust Survivors have presented a justiciable controver-\nsy.16\n\nB.     WAR OBJECTIVES CLAIMS\n\n   In contrast to the Property Claims, the Holocaust Survi-\nvors’ allegations that “[t]he actions and conduct of Defen-\ndants, in addition to being profitable, actively assisted the war\nobjectives of the Ustasha Regime” strike at the heart of the\nUstasha’s wartime conduct. The Holocaust Survivors catalog\na litany of claimed international law violations:\n\n       •   “Defendants knowingly facilitated and aided and\n           abetted the activities of war criminals . . . .\n           Defendants created a ‘ratline’ or ‘pipeline’ to\n           help the war criminals flee from prosecution.”\n\n       •   “Defendants . . . by assisting the Nazi backed\n           Ustasha Regime in preserving their Treasury for\n           the purpose of continuing a Government in Exile\n           . . . and evading justice for genocidal war\n           crimes[,] . . . committed war crimes, crimes\n           against peace and crimes against humanity . . . .”\n\n       •   “The [Vatican Bank] abused its position as the\n  16\n     Despite the dissent’s protest that “[t]his is not our ‘game,’ period,”\nDissent at 6705, the Constitution does not relegate us to the sidelines. We\nare a player in adjudicating claims, and a crucial one at that. Abdicating\nthat role and reflexively tossing the ball into the political branches’ court\nwithout the requisite analysis of the individual claims would be tanta-\nmount to shirking our “obligation[ ] to decide cases and controversies\nproperly presented to [us].” W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co., 493 U.S. at 409.\n\f6694                  ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n           Papal bank of Vatican City by a clear pattern of\n           violation of diplomatic norms . . . .”\n\n       •   “Serbs, Jews, and the Roma were slaughtered in\n           their villages after unspeakable tortures or burned\n           alive in their churches. . . . Many were used as\n           slave laborers. The remaining people were taken\n           to concentration camps where the majority per-\n           ished.”\n\n       •   “Jasenovac Concentration Camp complex . . .\n           was the home of indescribable brutality . . . . Not\n           only were inmates butchered but slave and forced\n           labor was performed for the benefit of the\n           Ustasha regime.”\n\nThese claims, which we have denominated as the “War\nObjectives Claims,” present a nonjusticiable political ques-\ntion.\n\n   [15] It is axiomatic that the Constitution vests the power to\nwage war in the President as Commander in Chief, U.S.\nConst. art. II, § 2, cl. 1, and the ability to “seize and subject\nto disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt\nto thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law\nof war” is “an important incident to [this power].” Ex parte\nQuirin, 317 U.S. 1, 28-29 (1942); Doe v. Bush, 323 F.3d 133,\n137 (1st Cir. 2003) (“The Constitution reserves the war pow-\ners to the legislative and executive branches.”). A plurality of\nthe Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that the judicial branch\n“accord[s] the greatest respect and consideration to the judg-\nments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual\nprosecution of a war, and recognize[s] that the scope of that\ndiscretion necessarily is wide.” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 124 S. Ct.\n2633, 2649 (2004).17 Wartime context aside, as discussed pre-\n  17\n    We stress, however, that courts are not powerless to review the politi-\ncal branches’ actions during wartime for, as the plurality cautioned in\n\f                      ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                      6695\nviously, “cases interpreting the broad textual grants of author-\nity to the President and Congress in the areas of foreign\naffairs leave only a narrowly circumscribed role for the Judi-\nciary.” Made in the USA Found., 242 F.3d at 1313.\n\n   Following World War II, the Executive Branch exercised\nits authority in a number of ways, including through the\nNuremberg Trials, which included prosecution for “murder,\nextermination, enslavement, [and] deportation” among other\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against\npeace. Charter of the International Military Tribunal, Aug. 8,\n1945, 59 Stat. 1546, 1547, 82 U.N.T.S. 279 (“Nuremberg\nCharter”). See generally Steven Fogelson, Note, The Nurem-\nberg Legacy: An Unfulfilled Promise, 63 S. Cal. L. Rev. 833\n(1990). Simply because the Nuremberg Charter does not\nexpressly preclude national courts from trying war criminals,\nNuremberg Charter, supra, 59 Stat. at 1545, does not mean\nthat it is our place to step in a half-century later and condemn\nthe Vatican Bank and related parties for “participat[ing] in the\nactivities of the Ustasha Regime in furtherance of the com-\nmission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, [and] crimes\nagainst peace.” We are not a war crimes tribunal. To act as\nsuch would require us to “intrud[e] unduly on certain policy\nchoices and value judgments that are constitutionally commit-\nted to [the political branches,]” Koohi, 976 F.2d at 1331, for\nwe do not and cannot know why the Allies made the policy\nchoice not to prosecute the Ustasha and the Vatican Bank. See\nCrosby v. Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 386\n(2000) (acknowledging that “the ‘nuances’ of ‘the foreign\npolicy of the United States . . . are much more the province\nof the Executive Branch and Congress than of this Court’ ”)\n(quoting Container Corp. of Am. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463\nU.S. 159, 196 (1983)).\n\nHamdi, “Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the\nExecutive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations\nin times of conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three\nbranches when individual liberties are at stake.” Hamdi, 124 S. Ct. at\n2650.\n\f6696               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   Indeed, the Holocaust Survivors’ allegations that the Vati-\ncan Bank violated international law by “creat[ing] a ‘ratline’\nor ‘pipeline’ to help the war criminals flee from prosecution”\ncould also be levied against the United States, which provided\nsimilar aid driven by the sudden shift in priorities from fight-\ning the Nazis to driving back Communism:\n\n    [The College of San Girolamo in Rome] helped fugi-\n    tive Croatian war criminals escape to the Western\n    Hemisphere in the early postwar years, and cooper-\n    ated with the “rat line” being used by the U.S. Army\n    Counter Intelligence Corps after the War to assist the\n    escape from Europe of anti-Communists. The fact\n    that the “rat line” later facilitated the escape even of\n    a Nazi war criminal like Klaus Barbie underscores\n    the shift in the Allies’ attitudes: World War II was\n    over; the Cold War was on.\n\nUstasha Treasury Report, supra note 3, at xviii. The United\nStates has acknowledged that “conflicting priorities on the\npart of the Allies—particularly the need to rebuild a war-torn\nEurope and assemble a Western coalition against Soviet\naggression with the onset of the Cold War—led to an insuffi-\ncient recovery of looted gold and other assets.” Id. at iv. It is\nnot our role to sit in judgment as to whether the perceived\nCommunist threat justified assisting alleged war criminals.\nRather, we are mindful of the Supreme Court’s admonition\nthat it is up to the political branches to come to terms with\nthese “delicate [and] complex” foreign policy decisions “for\nwhich the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor respon-\nsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain\nof political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.”\nChicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333\nU.S. 103, 111 (1948).\n\n   Whether the Holocaust Survivors’ claims related to slave\nlabor are justiciable is a more nettlesome question. The exact\nnature of the slave labor claims against the Vatican Bank is\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                        6697\nnot entirely clear from the Complaint. The Holocaust Survi-\nvors allege that class members share a common question of\nfact whether “Defendants were directly and/or indirectly\ninvolved with the . . . conversion of . . . Plaintiffs’ labor” and\nfurther allege that “Defendants have failed to . . . pay to Plain-\ntiffs . . . the value of slave labor performed.” Although the\nComplaint maintains that many of the Ustasha officials were\nRoman Catholic clergy, it does not indicate that the Vatican\nBank itself directly exploited the slave labor. Unlike cases in\nwhich the defendants were the enslaving entities, the slave\nlabor claims against the Vatican Bank are, in effect, derivative\nclaims: The Ustasha profited from slave labor, these profits\nbenefitted the Ustasha treasury, and portions of these tainted\nfunds were transferred to the Vatican Bank. Cf. Deutsch, 324\nF.3d at 704 (plaintiffs “were forced to work as slaves” for\ndefendant corporation); Iwanowa, 67 F. Supp. 2d at 431\n(defendants forced plaintiffs “to perform forced labor under\ninhuman conditions”).\n\n   [16] Determining whether the Vatican Bank was unjustly\nenriched by profits derived from slave labor would therefore\nnecessitate that we look behind the Vatican Bank and indict\nthe Ustasha regime for its wartime conduct.18 We are not will-\ning to take this leap. Condemning—for its wartime actions—\na foreign government with which the United States was at war\nwould require us to “review[ ] an exercise of foreign policy\njudgment by the coordinate political branch to which author-\nity to make that judgment has been ‘constitutional[ly] com-\n  18\n     In rejecting the Holocaust Survivors’ slave labor claims, we distin-\nguish profits derived from slave labor from those derived from investing\nseized assets. In the former case, the court would need to evaluate the\nUstasha’s wartime use of slave labor, quantify the monetary value of this\nlabor, and then determine the portion thereof that flowed to the Vatican\nBank. In contrast, if the Holocaust Survivors can surmount the daunting\nevidentiary obstacles and establish that seized assets came to rest with the\nVatican Bank, then the Property Claims could encompass both the value\nof the assets themselves as well as any profits earned by the Vatican Bank\nfrom the subsequent investment of the seized assets.\n\f6698                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nmit[ted].’ ” Goldwater, 444 U.S. at 1006 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting Baker, 369 U.S. at 217); cf. Linder v.\nPortocarrero, 963 F.2d 332, 337 (11th Cir. 1992) (holding in\ncase involving the murder of an American by the Nicaraguan\nContras that “the broad allegations . . . which comprise the\nentire military and political opposition in Nicaragua, are non-\njusticiable”).\n\n   [17] This determination that the slave labor claims run\nafoul of the first Baker test is reinforced by the third Baker\ntest, which asks whether the issue can be decided “without an\ninitial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial\ndiscretion.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. It is not our place to\nspeak for the U.S. Government by declaring that a foreign\ngovernment is at fault for using forced labor during World\nWar II. Any such policy condemning the Ustasha regime must\nfirst emanate from the political branches.\n\n   Our conclusion that the slave labor claims are not justicia-\nble comports with our decision in Deutsch. The two cases are\nsuperficially similar in that they address the same general sub-\nject matter of Holocaust-era slave labor claims. In Deutsch,\nhowever, we based our holding on federal-state relations\nrather than separation of powers concerns.19 324 F.3d at 705-\n16. And, unlike this case where there are no treaties on point,\nwe emphasized in Deutsch that “the United States resolved\nthe war against Germany by becoming a party to a number of\ntreaties and international agreements.” Id. at 712 n.15. Conse-\nquently, although in both cases we reach the same ultimate\nconclusion that the slave labor claims cannot proceed, we do\nso here because adjudicating these claims would entail med-\n  19\n     The district court in Deutsch dismissed the action as presenting a non-\njusticiable political question. See Deutsch, 324 F.3d at 705 (citing Deutsch\nv. Turner, No. CV 00-4405 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2000)). On appeal, we dis-\nagreed with the court’s application of the doctrine on the basis that the\nmere application of treaties concluded with Germany did not raise a politi-\ncal question. 324 F.3d at 713 n.11.\n\f                      ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                        6699\ndling in matters reserved to the political branches and not\nbecause this result is compelled by treaties.\n\n   Nor does our decision conflict with the Second Circuit’s\nreasoning in Kadic, a case which, in addition to geographic\nparallels, involved claims tied to similar genocidal acts. See\n70 F.3d at 236-37. In Kadic, Croats and Muslims brought suit\nagainst Radovan Karadzic under the ATS alleging that he\noversaw the genocidal campaign conducted by Bosnian-Serb\nmilitary forces. Id. In holding that the claims were not barred\nby the political question doctrine, the court cautioned that\n“judges should not reflexively invoke the[ ] doctrine[ ] to\navoid difficult and somewhat sensitive decisions in the con-\ntext of human rights.” Id. at 249. We agree. Unlike in Kadic,\nhowever, we think that “weigh[ing] carefully the relevant\nconsiderations” at stake in this particular case, adjudicating\nthe slave labor claims in the context presented here would\n“compromis[e] the primacy of the political branches in for-\neign affairs.” Id. Not only did the State Department “ex-\npressly disclaim[ ] any concern that the political question\ndoctrine should be invoked” in Kadic, id. at 250, but the\nclaims in Kadic focused on the acts of a single individual dur-\ning a localized conflict rather than asking the court to under-\ntake the complex calculus of assigning fault for actions taken\nby a foreign regime during the morass of a world war. The\nslave labor claims present no mere tort suit. On the contrary,\nthese claims fundamentally rest on “controversies which\nrevolve around policy choices and value determinations con-\nstitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of Congress\nor the confines of the Executive Branch.” Japan Whaling\nAss’n, 478 U.S. at 230.\n\n   [18] Our decision to affirm the district court’s dismissal of\nthe War Objectives Claims is not a result we reach lightly.20\n  20\n    We caution that our holding does not signify that slave labor claims\nautomatically raise issues that are committed to the political branches. As\nwith all claims, this determination must be based on the circumstances of\n\f6700                  ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nWe do not wish to imply in the slightest that these claims do\nnot represent gravely serious harms for which the Holocaust\nSurvivors deserve relief. The difficulty is that relief lies else-\nwhere. As the court observed in In re Austrian and German\nBank Holocaust Litigation, “Those persecuted by the Nazis\nwere the victims of unspeakable acts of inhumanity. At the\nsame time, however, it must be understood that the law is a\ntool of limited capacity. Not every wrong, even the worst, is\ncognizable as a legal claim.” 80 F. Supp. 2d at 177. In this\ncase, the Holocaust Survivors must look to the political\nbranches for resolution of the War Objectives Claims which,\nat base, are political questions.\n\n                          III.   CONCLUSION\n\n   We REVERSE the district court’s grant of the Vatican\nBank’s motion to dismiss with regard to the Holocaust Survi-\nvors’ Property Claims for conversion, unjust enrichment, res-\ntitution, and an accounting. We AFFIRM the district court’s\ngrant of the Vatican Bank’s motion to dismiss with regard to\nall other claims in the Complaint, specifically the War Objec-\ntives Claims. We also AFFIRM the district court’s order dis-\nmissing the action against the Croatian Liberation Movement\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and\nREMANDED. Costs shall be awarded to appellants.\n\n\n\nTROTT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part, and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   It is unlikely that a better case could be made for the major-\nity’s view that some of these matters are justiciable than the\n\nthe particular case. See, e.g., In re African-American, 304 F. Supp. 2d at\n1056-60 (concluding that slave reparation claims were not justiciable in\npart because “reparations to former slaves following the Civil War[ ] was\nconsidered and rejected by the Representative Branches”).\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6701\none made by Judge McKeown in her well written opinion.\nNevertheless, and with all due respect to my esteemed col-\nleagues, I find part of their analysis unconvincing. In the\nmain, the segregation for analytical purposes of the plaintiffs’\nclaims into two distinct groups — “Property Claims” as dis-\ntinguished from “War Objective Claims” — splits the atom\nwhere it is not divisible. In this respect, I agree with the\ndefendants/appellees: “All claims asserted by plaintiffs are\n‘inextricably intertwined’ with the Executive Branch’s powers\nover war-related crimes, such that the judiciary is powerless\nto adjudicate them.” Accordingly, although I agree that the\nso-called War Objective Claims are not justiciable, I respect-\nfully dissent as to the others.\n\n   I concur in and adopt the district court’s view that appel-\nlants’ complaint unmistakably and inextricably raises issues\nthat our Constitution commits to the legislative and executive\nbranches of our government, not to the judiciary. Alperin v.\nVatican Bank, 242 F. Supp. 2d 686 (N.D. Cal. 2003). This\ncase fatally falls into at least two of the off-limits political\nquestion categories — defined as “formulations” — in Baker\nv. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962): (1) “a textually demonstra-\nble constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate\npolitical department;” and (2) “a lack of judicially discover-\nable and manageable standards for resolving it.” Id.\n\n                                I\n\n   As to the primary formulation — a constitutional commit-\nment of the issue to a political department — the record com-\npels us to take our lead from Chief Justice Marshall who said\nthat “[q]uestions, in their nature political, or which are, by the\nConstitution and laws, submitted to the executive, can never\nbe made in this court.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1\nCranch) 137, 170 (1803) (emphasis added). The Baker court\nrepeated this “clearly settled” principle, which emanates from\nour Constitution’s careful allocation and separation of powers\nbetween our three branches, and in so doing identified “for-\n\f6702               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\neign relations” as one of the areas in which nonjusticiable\npolitical questions routinely arise, citing Oetjen v. Cent.\nLeather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302 (1918): “The conduct of the\nforeign relations of our Government is committed by the Con-\nstitution to the executive and legislative — ‘the political’ —\ndepartments of the government, and the propriety of what\nmay be done in the exercise of this political power is not sub-\nject to judicial inquiry or decision.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 211 n.\n31. In elaboration of this doctrine, the Oetjen court said,\n\n       The principle that the conduct of one independent\n    government cannot be successfully questioned in the\n    courts of another is as applicable to a case involving\n    the title to property brought within the custody of a\n    court, such as we have here, as it was held to be to\n    the cases cited, in which claims for damages were\n    based upon acts done in a foreign country, for it rests\n    at last upon the highest considerations of interna-\n    tional comity and expediency. To permit the validity\n    of the acts of one sovereign state to be reexamined\n    and perhaps condemned by the courts of another\n    would very certainly “imperil the amicable relations\n    between governments and vex the peace of nations.”\n\n246 U.S. at 303-04.\n\n   One of the earliest cases involving the respective authority\nof courts and Congress appears to be United States v. Palmer,\n16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610 (1818), a case involving inter alia a\nrobbery committed on the high seas by a non-citizen on board\na ship belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state. The\nCourt held (1) that a specific act of Congress criminalizing\npiracy did not give authority to our federal courts to take cog-\nnizance of, try, and punish such an act on the high seas as rob-\nbery, and (2) that the courts are not empowered to so act\nwithout authority from Congress. Id. at 633-35. In explanation\nof this decision, Chief Justice Marshall said,\n\f               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                     6703\nThose questions which respect the rights of a part of\na foreign empire, which asserts, and is contending\nfor its independence, and the conduct which must be\nobserved by the courts of the union towards the sub-\njects of such section of an empire who may be\nbrought before the tribunals of this country, are\nequally delicate and difficult.\n\n    As it is understood that the construction which has\nbeen given to the act of Congress, will render a par-\nticular answer to them unnecessary, the court will\nonly observe, that such questions are generally rather\npolitical than legal in their character. They belong\nmore properly to those who can declare what the\nlaw shall be; who can place the nation in such a\nposition with respect to foreign powers as to their\nown judgment shall appear wise; to whom are\nentrusted all its foreign relations; than to that tribu-\nnal whose power as well as duty is confined to the\napplication of the rule which the legislature may\nprescribe for it. In such contests a nation may\nengage itself with the one party or the other — may\nobserve absolute neutrality — may recognize the\nnew state absolutely — or may make a limited rec-\nognition of it. The proceeding in courts must depend\nso entirely on the course of the government, that it\nis difficult to give a precise answer to questions\nwhich do not refer to a particular nation. It may be\nsaid, generally, that if the government remains neu-\ntral, and recognizes the existence of a civil war, its\ncourts cannot consider as criminal those acts of hos-\ntility which war authorizes, and which the new gov-\nernment may direct against its enemy. To decide\notherwise, would be to determine that the war prose-\ncuted by one of the parties was unlawful, and would\nbe to arrange the nation to which the court belongs\nagainst that party. This would transcend the limits\nprescribed to the judicial department.\n\f6704               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nId. at 634-35 (emphasis added).\n\n  The Court registered a similar observation in Foster v. Neil-\nson:\n\n       In a controversy between two nations concerning\n    national boundary, it is scarcely possible that the\n    courts of either should refuse to abide by the mea-\n    sures adopted by its own government. There being\n    no common tribunal to decide between them, each\n    determines for itself on its own rights, and if they\n    cannot adjust their differences peaceably, the right\n    remains with the strongest. The judiciary is not that\n    department of the government to which the assertion\n    of its interests against foreign powers is confided;\n    and its duty commonly is to decide upon individual\n    rights, according to those principles which the polit-\n    ical departments of the nation have established.\n\n27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 307-08 (1829), overruled on other\ngrounds by United States v. Percheman, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 51\n(1833) (emphasis added).\n\n   The Supreme Court has spoken frequently about this issue,\nand each time it has reiterated the structural and prudential\nproposition that the “President also possesses in his own right\ncertain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as\nCommander-in-Chief and as the Nation’s organ in foreign\naffairs.” Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp.,\n333 U.S. 103, 109 (1948). Accordingly, the Court has made\nit clear that\n\n    the very nature of executive decisions as to foreign\n    policy is political, not judicial. Such decisions are\n    wholly confided by our Constitution to the political\n    departments of the government, Executive and Leg-\n    islative. . . . They are decisions of a kind for which\n    the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6705\n    responsibility and have long been held to belong in\n    the domain of political power not subject to judicial\n    intrusion or inquiry.\n\nId. 333 U.S. at 111. See also Schroeder v. Bush, 263 F.3d\n1169, 1175 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\n   Parenthetically, unlike the majority, I read this principle to\ninclude all matters that fall by their constitutional DNA into\nthis sphere, whether the political branches have done anything\nabout them or not. With all respect to my valued colleagues,\nI see it as a mistake to measure this issue of justifiability by\na “this lawsuit is the only game in town” standard. This is not\nour “game,” period, and we do not become vested with juris-\ndiction by default of the other branches. The majority opinion\nindicates that Executive silence is somehow relevant. I hum-\nbly disagree. The silence of another Branch cannot give us\njurisdiction we do not otherwise have. The non-existence of\nan executive agreement is meaningless.\n\n   Notwithstanding appellants’ lawyers’ ability to cast this\ndispute in “garden-variety” legal terms, i.e., conversion,\nunjust enrichment, restitution, etc., the ineffable fact remains\nthat this functionally is a lawsuit against (1) the Vatican itself,\n(2) the Vatican Bank, which is an instrumentality of the sov-\nereign state of the Vatican, and (3) untold others — including\nprobably the Pope — seeking relief for World War II wrongs\nagainst foreigners committed by the Nazis and their allies in\nEurope almost sixty years ago. As Judge Debevoise said in\nBurger-Fischer v. DeGussa AG, 65 F. Supp. 2d 248, 281\n(D.N.J. 1999), “It is not accurate to characterize the present\nactions as simply [typical] controversies between private par-\nties.” Much more is clearly at stake. Stripped to its essentials,\nthis is a derivative lawsuit against a sovereign seeking “repa-\nrations” for injuries and losses suffered during wartime at the\nhands of the Nazis and their alleged accomplices. As\nacknowledged by the majority, the Vatican has filed a note of\nprotest and asked our State Department to intervene. This set\n\f6706               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nof facts and circumstances involving a foreign sovereign\nstrikes me as demanding a “single-voiced statement” of our\ngovernment’s views, not a series of judgments by our courts.\nBaker, 369 U.S. at 211. I conclude, therefore, that the foreign\npolicy quintessence of this case renders it as a subject matter\nbeyond the power of the judiciary to intrude or to inquire.\n\n Judge Greenaway’s astute analysis in Iwanowa v. Ford\nMotor Company, 67 F. Supp. 2d 424, 485 (1999) is apposite:\n\n       The executive branch has always addressed claims\n    for reparations as claims between governments. His-\n    torically, at the end of a war, there has always been\n    a declaration of victorious nations and defeated\n    nations. As part of that process, the victorious\n    nations invariably discuss the reparations that the\n    defeated nations must pay to compensate the prevail-\n    ing countries and their nationals for the loss that the\n    aggressor country has caused. The nature of war is\n    such that the governments of the victorious nations\n    determine and negotiate the resolution of the claims\n    of their nationals by way of agreements between the\n    nations involved or affected by the war. This is evi-\n    dent from the reparations provisions in the Treaty of\n    Versailles following World War I, and the discussion\n    of reparations in the Yalta Conference, the Potsdam\n    Conference and the Paris Reparations Treaty at the\n    end of World War II. More recently, at the end of the\n    Gulf War, the United Nations established an interna-\n    tional claims resolution tribunal to resolve claims\n    against Iraq. See Elyse J. Garmise, The Iraqi Claims\n    Process and the Ghost of Versailles, 67\n    N.Y.U.L.Rev. 840, 841 (1992). Thus, it is evident\n    that responsibility for resolving forced labor claims\n    arising out of a war is constitutionally committed to\n    the political branches of government, not the judi-\n    ciary.\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6707\n   In a footnote to this discussion, the court observed that the\n“ ‘concept of reparations encompasses all international law\nclaims for compensation related to war [including] individual\nclaims by injured citizens of victorious powers.’ ” Id. at 485\nn.84 (quoting Ministerial Director Horst Teltschik).\n\n   When California attempted by legislation to insert itself\ninto Holocaust-era insurance policies, the Supreme Court\nstepped in and held that California’s law was preempted\nbecause it interfered with the President’s conduct of our\nNation’s foreign policy. In reversing our Ninth Circuit opin-\nion to the contrary, see Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of\nAm. v. Low, 296 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. 2002), the Court made cer-\ntain observations about the authority of the President that add\nconsiderable weight against the view that Alperin’s claims are\njusticiable:\n\n       Nor is there any question generally that there is\n    executive authority to decide what that [foreign rela-\n    tions] policy should be. Although the source of the\n    President’s power to act in foreign affairs does not\n    enjoy any textual detail, the historical gloss on the\n    “executive Power” vested in Article II of the Consti-\n    tution has recognized the President’s “vast share of\n    responsibility for the conduct of our foreign rela-\n    tions.”\n\nAm. Ins. Ass’n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 414 (2003) (cita-\ntion omitted). The Garamendi court continued:\n\n       At a more specific level, our cases have recog-\n    nized that the President has authority to make “exec-\n    utive agreements” with other countries, requiring no\n    ratification by the Senate or approval by Congress,\n    this power having been exercised since the early\n    years of the Republic. See Dames & Moore v.\n    Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 679, 682-683, 101 S.Ct. 2972,\n    69 L.Ed.2d 918 (1981); United States v. Pink, 315\n\f6708              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n    U.S. 203, 223, 230, 62 S.Ct. 552, 86 L.Ed. 796\n    (1942); United States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324, 330-\n    331, 57 S.Ct. 758, 81 L.Ed. 1134 (1937); see also L.\n    Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United States Con-\n    stitution 219, 496, n. 163 (2d ed.1996) (“Presidents\n    from Washington to Clinton have made many thou-\n    sands of agreements . . . on matters running the\n    gamut of U.S. foreign relations”). Making executive\n    agreements to settle claims of American nationals\n    against foreign governments is a particularly long-\n    standing practice, the first example being as early as\n    1799, when the Adams administration settled\n    demands against the Dutch Government by Ameri-\n    can citizens who lost their cargo when Dutch priva-\n    teers overtook the schooner Wilmington Packet. See\n    Dames & Moore, supra, at 679-680, and n. 8, 101\n    S.Ct. 2972.\n\n                          *   *   *\n\n    To begin with, resolving Holocaust-era insurance\n    claims that may be held by residents of this country\n    is a matter well within the Executive’s responsibility\n    for foreign affairs. Since claims remaining in the\n    aftermath of hostilities may be “sources of friction”\n    acting as an “impediment to resumption of friendly\n    relations” between the countries involved, Pink,\n    supra, at 225, 62 S.Ct. 552, there is a “longstanding\n    practice” of the national Executive to settle them in\n    discharging its responsibility to maintain the\n    Nation’s relationships with other countries, Dames\n    & Moore, 453 U.S., at 679, 101 S.Ct. 2972. The\n    issue of restitution for Nazi crimes has in fact been\n    addressed in Executive Branch diplomacy and for-\n    malized in treaties and executive agreements over\n    the last half century, and although resolution of pri-\n    vate claims was postponed by the Cold War, secur-\n    ing private interests is an express object of\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6709\n    diplomacy today, just as it was addressed in agree-\n    ments soon after the Second World War. Vindicating\n    victims injured by acts and omissions of enemy cor-\n    porations in wartime is thus within the traditional\n    subject matter of foreign policy in which national,\n    not state, interests are overriding, and which the\n    National Government has addressed.\n\nId. at 415, 420-21 (emphasis added).\n\n  Finally, as we recognized in Deutsch v. Turner Corp., 324\nF.3d 692, 712-13 (9th Cir. 2003),\n\n       The United States has already exercised its own\n    exclusive authority to resolve the war, including\n    claims arising out of it. It did not choose, however,\n    to incorporate into that resolution a private right of\n    action against our wartime enemies or their nation-\n    als. The United States resolved the war against Ger-\n    many by becoming a party to a number of treaties\n    and international agreements, beginning with the\n    1945 agreements at Yalta and Potsdam, in which the\n    United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed\n    to extract reparations from Germany and its nation-\n    als but did not include a private right of action\n    against either. . . . Most recently, the Foundation\n    Agreement of July 17, 2000, an executive agreement\n    between the governments of Germany and the\n    United States, provided a limited form of remedy for\n    claimants such as Deutsch.\n\n   I would add that we entered into a similar treaty with Italy\nin 1947. Article 75 of that Treaty provides with respect to res-\ntitution as follows:\n\n       1. Italy accepts the principles of the United\n    Nations Declaration of January 5, 1943, and shall\n    return, in the shortest possible time, property\n\f6710               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n    removed from the territory of any of the United\n    Nations.\n\n       2. The obligation to make restitution applies to\n    all identifiable property at present in Italy which was\n    removed by force or duress by any of the Axis Pow-\n    ers from the territory of any of the United Nations,\n    irrespective of any subsequent transactions by which\n    the present holder of any such property has secured\n    possession.\n\n       ....\n\n       8. The Italian Government shall restore to [the\n    United Nation] all monetary gold looted or wrong-\n    fully removed to Italy.\n\nTreaty of Peace with Italy, Feb. 10, 1947, U.S.-Italy, United\nStates Statutes At Large, Vol. 61, pp. 1400-01.\n\n                               II\n\n   As recognized by the majority, “the potential class is mas-\nsive,” and, as the district court concluded, the case as pleaded\nwould be unmanageable. This unimpeachable observation\nbrings this lawsuit within Baker’s second category: the task is\nbeyond the competence of a court of law. The district court\nrelied, in this respect, on Kelberine v. Societe Internationale,\n363 F.2d 989 (D.C. Cir. 1966), which correctly said,\n\n    The span between the doing of the damage and the\n    application of the claimed assuagement is too vague.\n    The time is too long. The identity of the alleged tort-\n    feasors is too indefinite. The procedure sought —\n    adjudication of some two hundred thousand claims\n    for multifarious damages inflicted twenty to thirty\n    years ago in a European area by a government then\n    in power — is too complicated, too costly, to justify\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6711\n    undertaking by a court without legislative provision\n    of the means wherewith to proceed.\n\nId. at 995.\n\n   I agree with our prudent district court’s carefully consid-\nered opinion, which echos the Supreme Court’s concerns in\nWaterman about the aptitude and facilities in this context, that\nthis case as presented would lack judicial reins:\n\n       Here, by contrast, plaintiffs do not seek recovery\n    of money and assets withheld from specific accounts\n    but, rather, the undetermined value of property\n    stolen in untold ways in a multiplicity of regions by\n    both military personnel and civilians. Moreover,\n    plaintiffs seek such recovery out of an undivided\n    portion of the Ustasha Treasury transferred to the\n    IOR. Such claims require a review of materials from\n    a multitude of foreign sources that, “by sheer bulk\n    alone,” are likely to be unmanageable. See Atlee, 347\n    F. Supp. [689, 701 (E.D. Pa. 1972)]. Compounding\n    the problem, “there is a distinct possibility that the\n    parties might not be able to compile all of the rele-\n    vant information, thus making any attempt to justify\n    a ruling on the merits of an issue that will affect the\n    nation difficult and imprudent.” See Iwanowa, 67\n    F. Supp. 2d [424, 483-84 (D.N.J. 1999)]; see also\n    Atlee, 347 F. Supp. at 702 (noting “the inherent\n    inability of a court to predict the international conse-\n    quences flowing from a decision on the merits.”)\n    Further, plaintiffs’ claims require this Court to\n    resolve the competing rights to the Ustasha Treasury\n    of potentially hundreds of thousands of citizens of\n    various nations, funds as to which any number of\n    persons harmed by the Ustasha regime, both repre-\n    sented and not represented in these proceedings,\n    might equally assert a claim.\n\f6712               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nAlperin, 242 F. Supp. 2d at 694-95. It will be interesting to\nsay the least to watch the district court struggle on remand to\nenforce its rulings against the Vatican. Based on my experi-\nence with litigation involving foreign nations, it will be just\na matter of time until the State and Justice Departments are\ndragged into this case as the district court begins to reach out\nfor evidence and witnesses and to exercise its power to\nenforce its orders.\n\n                              III\n\n   No one could possibly be comfortable identifying a barrier\nto the relief sought by these plaintiffs, persons who suffered\nsome of the most unspeakably grievous injuries to their lives\nand families. As Judge Reinhardt said in Deutsch, the Holo-\ncaust was “the most atrocious act ever perpetrated by a civi-\nlized (or uncivilized) people, an act unparalleled in history.”\n324 F.3d at 704. Nevertheless, our courts are not the appropri-\nate fora for redress. What the majority has unintentionally\naccomplished in embracing this case is nothing less than the\nwholesale creation of a World Court, an international tribunal\nwith breathtaking and limitless jurisdiction to entertain the\nWorld’s failures, no matter where they happen, when they\nhappen, to whom they happen, the identity of the wrongdoer,\nand the sovereignty of one of the parties. The consequences\nof this holding are overwhelming. I need go no deeper than\nthe third amended class action complaint to illustrate this\npoint:\n\n       1. This is a civil action arising under customary\n    international law and the laws of the United States of\n    America on behalf of named Plaintiffs and a class of\n    all Serbs, Jews, and former Soviet Union citizens\n    (and their heirs and beneficiaries), who suffered\n    physical, monetary and/or property losses including\n    slave labor, due to the systematic and brutal extermi-\n    nation of Jews, Serbs, and Romani by the Nazi pup-\n    pet Regime, The Independent State of Croatia\n\f              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                     6713\n(NDH) led by Pavelic’s Ustasha Regime, and as a\nresult of the occupation of the former Soviet Union\nby Croatian military forces in concert with their Ger-\nman occupation forces. This is an action against the\nVatican Bank, Franciscan Order and Unknown Cath-\nolic Religious Orders, Croatian Liberation Move-\nment (HOP), Swiss National Bank (SNB) and as yet\nunnamed recipients of Nazi and Ustasha Loot,\nSwiss, Austrian, Argentine, Spanish, Italian, Portu-\nguese, and German banking institutions and Califor-\nnia and other United States correspondent banks for\ntheir participation in and benefit from the Ustasha\nRegime’s acts of cruelty and violence.\n\n   2. Plaintiffs and their heirs and beneficiaries seek\naccounting, restitution, disgorgement, and to recover\ndamages arising out of the participation of Defen-\ndants, Vatican Bank or Istituto Per Le Opere Di\nReligione (hereinafter referred to as IOR), the Fran-\nciscan Order (OFM) and Unknown Catholic Reli-\ngious Orders, Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP),\nSwiss National Bank (SNB), unknown recipients of\nNazi and Ustasha loot, and other banking institutions\nand correspondent banks and religious orders and\norganizations in a common scheme and course of\nconduct: (a) to profit from, both directly and indi-\nrectly, the inhumane and genocidal system instituted\nby the Nazi-directed Ustasha Regime in Croatia and\nterritories subject to Croatian civil or military occu-\npation upon those peoples that it viewed, not as\nhuman beings, but as subhuman according to Nazi\nand Ustasha ideology; (b) to obtain, accept, conceal,\nconvert and profit from assets looted by the Ustasha\nRegime and deposited in, or liquidated through, the\nIOR, SNB, unnamed Doe Defendant Banks, and\nFranciscan Order during the ascendancy of the\nUstasha Regime and following the demise of the\nRegime at the behest of the former Ustasha and Nazi\n\f6714              ALPERIN v.

Defendants committed, conspired to commit,\n    and aided and abetted others who committed crimes\n    against peace, war crimes and crimes against human-\n    ity. Defendants assisted the Ustasha Regime and its\n    leaders as well as prominent Nazis to successfully\n    evade justice for their genocidal crimes by conceal-\n    ing and making available the considerable assets of\n    the Ustasha Treasury.\n\n                          *   *   *\n\n       WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court:\n\n       1.

Award Plaintiffs the value of any identified\n    property deposited by, or looted from, Plaintiffs and\n    received by Defendants plus interest compounded\n    annually since 1941.\n\n       6. Award Plaintiffs compensatory and punitive\n    damages arising out of Defendants’ unlawful behav-\n    ior in trafficking in, retaining, disposing and con-\n    cealing Looted Assets or profits of the Ustasha\n    Regime with knowledge that the assets or profits\n    were the fruits of Nazi-Ustasha violations of interna-\n    tional law and were used to assist war criminals to\n    evade justice.\n\n       7. Order Defendants to disgorge any profits\n    earned by trafficking in, disposing of or concealing\n    the Ustasha Treasury which was the fruits of viola-\n    tions of international law.\n\n      8. Grant Plaintiffs a jury trial on all issues so tri-\n    able.\n\n       9. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action,\n    including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expert fees;\n    and,\n\n      10. Grant such other and further relief as shall\n    seem just to the Court.\n\n   Our unauthorized transformation of our district courts into\nan open-door international tribunal far overreaches the author-\nity of “the least dangerous branch” of our government. This\nopinion, albeit well-intentioned, extends the concept of judi-\ncial authority into unknown territory and mistakenly exercises\n\f6716              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\npower and competence that plainly belongs to the President\nand to Congress. Today, it is the Vatican and the Holocaust.\nTomorrow, will it be horrors from Haiti, Cuba, Rwanda,\nSouth Africa, the Soviet Union, Bosnia, Sudan, Somalia,\nNorth Korea, Iraq, and who knows where? The majority opin-\nion sends our district judges on a crusade from which they are\nnot equipped and which is doomed to flounder. As a class\naction, it will make all others seem like cakewalks. One can\nonly wonder if the filing of this lawsuit is nothing more than\na ploy to force the President and the State Department to take\naction. Similarly, one can only wonder why the beleaguered\nState Department would stand silently by and allow this case\nto continue — in the Ninth Circuit no less, where mistakenly\nwe would have allowed the Garamendi litigation to proceed.\n\n  Thus, I respectfully disagree that Alperin’s unseverable\n“garden-variety” claims are justiciable.\n\f",

The Supreme Court has\ncounseled, however, that “it is error to suppose that every case\nor controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond\njudicial cognizance.” Baker v.

The justiciability inquiry is limited to “ ‘political\nquestions,’ not . . . ‘political cases,’ ” id. at 217, and should\nbe made on a “case-by-case” basis, id. at 211.\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6651\n   Although the political question doctrine often lurks in the\nshadows of cases involving foreign relations, it is infrequently\naddressed head on.

The procedural posture of this case,\nhowever, places the issue squarely before us.\n\n   With these principles in mind, in determining the threshold\nissue of justiciability, we scrutinize each claim individually.\nIndeed, in our system of separation of powers, we should not\nabdicate the court’s Article III responsibility—the resolution\nof “cases” and “controversies”—in favor of the Executive\nBranch, particularly where, as here, the Executive has\ndeclined a long-standing invitation to involve itself in the dis-\npute. We conclude that some of the claims are barred by the\npolitical question doctrine and some of the claims are justicia-\nble. Although the parties have multiple procedural and sub-\nstantive challenges to overcome down the road, they are\nentitled to their day—or years—in court on the justiciable\nclaims.\n\n   A group of twenty-four individuals and four organizations\n(the “Holocaust Survivors”) claim that the Vatican Bank,\nknown by its official title Istituto per le Opere di Religione,\nthe Order of Friars Minor, and the Croatian Liberation Move-\nment (Hrvatski Oslobodilacki Pokret), profited from the geno-\ncidal acts of the Croatian Ustasha political regime (the\n“Ustasha”), which was supported throughout World War II by\nNazi forces. That profit allegedly passed through the Vatican\nBank in the form of proceeds from looted assets and slave\nlabor. The Holocaust Survivors brought suit in federal court\nclaiming conversion, unjust enrichment, restitution, the right\nto an accounting, and human rights violations and violations\nof international law arising out of the defendants’ alleged\n\f6652                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\ninvolvement with the Ustasha during and following World\nWar II.\n\n   The Vatican Bank and the Order of Friars Minor moved to\ndismiss the Holocaust Survivors’ complaint on multiple\ngrounds; by agreement of the parties the district court limited\nits discussion to the issue of whether the Holocaust Survivors’\nclaims should be dismissed under the political question doc-\ntrine. The district court reasoned that the political question\ndoctrine bars consideration of the merits of the claims in their\nentirety. The district court dismissed the action against the\nCroatian Liberation Movement, which never appeared in the\naction, on the grounds that the claims were barred by both the\npolitical question doctrine and the lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion over this defendant. We reverse in part because certain of\nthe Holocaust Survivors’ claims—those with respect to lost\nand looted property (conversion, unjust enrichment, restitu-\ntion, and an accounting)—are not barred by this doctrine. In\ncontrast, the broad human rights allegations tied to the Vati-\ncan Bank’s alleged assistance to the war objectives of the\nUstasha present nonjusticiable controversies. Like the district\ncourt, we hold that the court did not have personal jurisdiction\nover the Croatian Liberation Movement.1 Consequently, we\nsee no reason to reach the political question doctrine vis-à-vis\nthis defendant.\n\n   Bearing in mind that “[t]he decision to deny access to judi-\ncial relief is not one we make lightly,” Liu v.

Much of the dissent focuses on downstream issues\nrelated to potential procedural and substantive pitfalls of the\nclaims. We do not discount the difficulties that may lie ahead;\nhowever, consideration of those issues is premature. Given\nthe passage of time, the generality of the allegations, the ques-\ntion of the applicability of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct, intricacies of the alleged claims, the class certification\nissues, whether the claimants have a cognizable legal claim,\nand a myriad of other procedural and jurisdictional hurdles,\nthe Holocaust Survivors may indeed face an uphill battle in\npursuing their claims. But this spectre of difficulty down the\nroad does not inform our justiciability determination at this\nearly stage of the proceedings.\n\n   Our conclusion is rooted in the principles of Baker v. Carr.\nDespite the dissent’s cataclysmic and speculative projections\nabout the sweep of our opinion, our decision boils down to\nletting the common law property claims proceed to the next\nstage and foreclosing the political, human rights, and war-\nrelated claims. In so doing, we respect the limits of our juris-\ndiction as a national court, recognize the role of the Executive\nin foreign relations, and stick to our role of interpreting the\nlaw.\n\f6654                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.     WORLD WAR II         AND THE    USTASHA TREASURY\n\n   The events at issue relate back to the actions of the Vatican\nduring and in the years following World War II.2 Following\nGermany’s blitzkrieg through Yugoslavia in 1941, a govern-\nment composed of members of the Ustasha was proclaimed\nthe head of a protectorate of Italy. See Ustasha Treasury Report3\nat 141. The Ustasha regime was supported throughout World\nWar II by German and Italian occupation forces. Id.\n  2\n    Regarding terminology, the Vatican City and the Holy See are closely\nrelated but not interchangeable entities:\n      The term “Holy See” refers to the composite of the authority,\n      jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisers\n      to direct the worldwide Roman Catholic Church. . . . . Created in\n      1929 to provide a territorial identity for the Holy See in Rome,\n      the State of the Vatican City is a recognized national territory\n      under international law. The Holy See, however, enters into inter-\n      national agreements and receives and sends diplomatic represen-\n      tatives.\nSee U.S. Dep’t of State, Background Note: The Holy See (Oct. 2004),\navailable at http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3819.htm (“Vatican Back-\nground Note”). See generally Robert John Araujo, The International Per-\nsonality and Sovereignty of the Holy See, 50 Cath. U. L. Rev. 291 (2001)\n(providing historical overview of the Holy See’s foreign relations and\narguing that it is a subject of international law). These nuances are not crit-\nical for purposes of this opinion. Therefore, for convenience, the term\n“Vatican” will be used to refer generally to the Catholic leadership cen-\ntered in the Vatican City.\n   3\n     In the late 1990s, the U.S. Government prepared a report on the\nUstasha wartime treasury as part of a larger effort “to confront the largely\nhidden history of Holocaust-related assets after five decades of neglect.”\nBureau of Public Affairs, U.S. Dep’t of State, Pub. No. 10557, U.S. Allied\nWartime and Postwar Relations and Negotiations With Argentina, Portu-\ngal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey on Looted Gold and German External\nAssets and U.S. Concerns About the Fate of the Wartime Ustasha Trea-\nsury, Supplement to the Preliminary Study on U.S. and Allied Efforts to\nRecover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany\nDuring World War II iii (1998) (“Ustasha Treasury Report”).\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6655\n   Although the United States and its allies were aware to\nsome extent of the Ustasha’s atrocities, “It is not clear if the\nAllied leaders clearly grasped that as many as 700,000 vic-\ntims, most of them Serbs, had been killed at the Ustasha death\ncamps . . . .” Id. at 142. The State Department’s report\ndescribes the Vatican’s role in less generous terms: “The Vat-\nican, which maintained an ‘Apostolic visitor’ in Zagreb from\nJune 1941 until the end of the War, was aware of the killing\ncampaign . . . . Croatian Catholic authorities condemned the\natrocities committed by the Ustashi, but remained otherwise\nsupportive of the regime.” Id. at 143.\n\n  The connections between the Vatican and the Ustasha\nreportedly continued in the years following World War II:\n\n    With the defeat in May 1945 of Hitler and his satel-\n    lites, including puppet Croatia, the leaders of the\n    Ustasha fled to Italy, where they found sanctuary at\n    the pontifical College of San Girolamo in Rome.\n    This College was most likely funded at least in part\n    by the remnants of the Ustasha treasury, and\n    appeared to operate with at least the tacit acquies-\n    cence of some Vatican officials.\n\nId. at xviii. It is unclear to what extent the Vatican was aware\nof these activities, but the State Department is dubious that\nthey were oblivious to the Ustasha’s presence:\n\n    Although no evidence has been found to directly\n    implicate the Pope or his advisers in the postwar\n    activities of the Ustasha in Italy, it seems unlikely\n    that they were entirely unaware of what was going\n    on. Vatican authorities have told us they have not\n    found any records that could shed light on the\n    Ustasha gold question.\n\nId. at 156.\n\f6656                  ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   The size and nature of the Ustasha treasury remains in con-\nsiderable doubt. According to the State Department, “The fig-\nure of 350 million Swiss francs (over $80 million) of Ustasha\ngold that U.S. intelligence reported in 1946 remains the only\nattempt to estimate the total financial resources available to\nthe Ustashi at the end of World War II.” Id. at 150. The State\nDepartment cautions that this estimate “remains unsubstan-\ntiated and may not include some or all of the sums reported\nelsewhere.” Id.\n\nB.     THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS’ CLAIMS\n\n   This background section on the claims is drawn from the\nHolocaust Survivors’ Third Amended Class Action Complaint\n(the “Complaint”), which is detailed and lengthy and refer-\nences a number of outside sources, such as the Ustasha Trea-\nsury Report. At this stage of the proceedings, we accept the\nallegations as true. See California v.

VATICAN BANK                          6657\nslave and forced laborers, prisoners, concentration camp, and\nghetto survivors.” The geographic scope of the class is also\nfar reaching with the Ustasha’s destruction extending beyond\nCroatia to Bosnia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, includ-\ning Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.\n\n   The jurisdictional bases of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims\nare similarly expansive. They claim jurisdiction pursuant to\nthe Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350 (“ATS”), the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (“FSIA”), 28\nU.S.C. § 1331, federal common law as it incorporates custom-\nary international law and treaties, diversity jurisdiction, and\nCalifornia state law.4\n  4\n    The viability of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims apart from the issue\nof the political question doctrine is not before us.

VATICAN BANK\n  2.    DEFENDANTS\n\n   The Complaint does not name the Vatican itself as a defen-\ndant but rather focuses on a closely related entity, the Vatican\nBank.5 The exact relationship between the Vatican and the\nVatican Bank is less than clear at this stage of the proceed-\nings. We are in no position to make a substantive judgment\nabout the nature of the Vatican Bank.6 The Complaint, which\nwe accept at face value, distinguishes between the two enti-\nties. The Vatican Bank has its principal place of business in\nthe Vatican City and is headed by a Bishop, but it conducts\ntransactions worldwide including “for-profit merchant bank-\ning transactions in the United States, California, and else-\nwhere.”\n\n   The actual dealings of the bank, however, are murky.\nIndeed, the Vatican Bank’s holdings and its specific transac-\ntions are opaque. In his declaration in support of the Holo-\ncaust Survivors’ motion for early jurisdictional discovery,\nJohn Loftus—a former prosecutor with the U.S. Department\n  5\n     The Complaint also names “Unknown Catholic Religious Orders,” a\nnumber of banking institutions (both named institutions and “Does #1-\n100”) and “unknown recipients of Nazi and Ustasha loot” as defendants.\nThe Holocaust Survivors voluntarily dismissed their claims against defen-\ndant Swiss National Bank in 2002.\n   6\n     Like its other ominous projections, the dissent jumps ahead to conclude\nthat this suit is “functionally” against “the Vatican itself” and “the Vatican\nBank, which is an instrumentality of the sovereign state of the Vatican,”\nand possibly even the Pope. Dissent at 6705. But we are nowhere near the\npoint of making such an assessment. Because this case comes to us at the\nmotion to dismiss stage, we must accept the Complaint’s demarcation\nbetween the Vatican Bank, which is named as a defendant, and the Vati-\ncan, which is not named as a defendant. Further, the potential overtones\nthat this case may have on relations with the Vatican leadership do not,\nas the dissent suggests, warrant dismissal. See Antolok v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522133\"><a href=\"/opinion/522133/cathelina-antolok-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (Wald, C.J., concurring in judgment\nonly) (“I read [Baker v. Carr] as a reminder that our focus should be on\nthe particular issue presented for our consideration, not the ancillary\neffects which our decision may have on political actors.”).\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6659\nof Justice’s Nazi-hunting unit—attests, “The Vatican Bank is\none of the most secretive financial institutions in the world.\nThe exact nature and ownership of the Vatican Bank is diffi-\ncult to ascertain owing to the secrecy surrounding it.”\n\n  The bank’s dealings and ownership may be shrouded in\nmystery, but the Vatican considers itself to have a stake in the\noutcome of these proceedings. In specific reference to this\ncase, the Vatican’s Secretariat of State sent a Verbal Note of\nProtest, dated October 23, 2000, to the U.S. Embassy in Rome\nrequesting as follows:\n\n    Basing itself upon the diplomatic relations which\n    exist between the United States of America and the\n    Holy See, as well as the recognition which the Gov-\n    ernment of the United States has accorded to the\n    sovereignty of the Holy See and of Vatican City\n    State, the Secretariat of State requests the interven-\n    tion of the Federal Government of the United States\n    of America.\n\n   The Order of Friars Minor joined the Vatican Bank in\nbringing the motion to dismiss. A religious brotherhood\nfounded by St. Francis Assisi, the organization includes “sev-\neral Croatian Franciscan Orders in California, the United\nStates, Croatia, and Italy.” During World War II, “Many high\nofficials of the Ustasha government were Roman Catholic\nclergy and, in particular, Franciscans.” These ties continued\nafter the war with the Order of Friars Minor providing aid to\nformer Ustasha.\n\n   Neither the district court nor the Holocaust Survivors dis-\ntinguished between the Vatican Bank and Order of Friars\nMinor in the treatment of the political question doctrine. Like-\nwise, because no distinction can be made on the basis of the\npleadings, we also address the two defendants together. For\nease of reference, from this point on in the opinion we refer\nto them collectively as the “Vatican Bank.”\n\f6660               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   The third defendant, the Croatian Liberation Movement, is\nidentified “as the successor to the Ustasha government.” The\nCroatian Liberation Movement allegedly “functioned as a\ngovernment in exile and coordinated terrorist activities in the\nUnited States and elsewhere.”\n\n  3.   CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n   The Complaint describes in detail the atrocities inflicted on\nthe Holocaust Survivors during World War II by the Ustasha\nand, more generally, by allied Fascists “believed to be Cro-\natians.” In addition to describing the looting of assets, the\nComplaint recites genocidal acts of the Ustasha, including\nthose carried out at the “Jasenovac Concentration Camp com-\nplex, termed by historians as the ‘Auschwitz of the Bal-\nkans.’ ”\n\n   Upon the collapse of the Ustasha regime in 1945, the Holo-\ncaust Survivors maintain that “all or a portion of the Ustasha\nTreasury was transferred to cooperative Roman Catholic cler-\ngyman [sic] and Franciscans for transport to Rome where\nFranciscans sympathetic to the Ustasha were based.” These\nfunds eventually found their way into the hands of the Vatican\nBank, among other recipients. As alleged in the Complaint,\n“A 1948 U.S. Army Intelligence reports [sic] confirmed 2,400\nkilos of Ustasha stolen gold were moved from the Vatican to\none of the Vatican’s secret Swiss bank accounts.” In the dec-\nades following World War II, the Holocaust Survivors con-\ntend that the Vatican Bank and the Croatian Liberation\nMovement continued to profit from transactions involving the\nUstasha treasury.\n\n  Having set forth these general allegations, the Complaint\nadvances five causes of action:\n\n  Conversion: The Holocaust Survivors first allege, “Defen-\ndants . . . have willfully and wrongfully misappropriated and\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6661\nconverted the value of [property taken from the Holocaust\nSurvivors] and its derivative profits into their own property.”\n\n   Unjust Enrichment: Second, defendants were unjustly\nenriched by “receiv[ing] stolen property given to them by\nmembers of the Ustasha Regime, which rightfully belongs to\n[the Holocaust Survivors], as well as the value of slave labor\nperformed.”\n\n   Restitution: The Holocaust Survivors allege in their third\nclaim that their “goods and property have been taken, thus\ndenying [them] the use and enjoyment thereof; Defendants\nhave wrongfully used and profited from that property.” Main-\ntaining that “compensation in damages is inadequate in that\nthe property taken cannot be replaced and the harm inflicted\ncannot be undone by mere compensation,” the Holocaust Sur-\nvivors call for “equitable remedies.”\n\n   Accounting: Fourth, the Holocaust Survivors request “the\nequitable remedy of accounting,” alleging that “Defendants\nhave never accounted for or paid the value of Plaintiffs’ prop-\nerty or the profits which Defendants have derived from that\nproperty, either during World War II or since World War II\nended.”\n\n  Human Rights Violations and Violations of International\nLaw: Finally, the Holocaust Survivors allege:\n\n    Defendants participated in the activities of the\n    Ustasha Regime in furtherance of the commission of\n    war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against\n    peace, torture, rape, starvation, physical and mental\n    abuse, summary execution and genocide. Specifi-\n    cally, the actions and conduct of Defendants, in addi-\n    tion to being profitable, actively assisted the war\n    objectives of the Ustasha Regime.\n\f6662               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nThe Complaint condemns the defendants’ aiding and abetting\nof war criminals after World War II by helping them to evade\nprosecution and to preserve the Ustasha treasury.\n\n   The Holocaust Survivors cite a multitude of legal bases for\nthese claims: “Defendants’ actions were in violation of\nnumerous international treaties and the fundamental human\nrights laws prohibiting genocide, war crimes, crimes against\nhumanity and crimes against peace. Defendants’ actions vio-\nlated customary international law . . . .” They also claim that\n“Defendants committed torts under the laws of the United\nStates, requiring Defendants to pay . . . appropriate compensa-\ntory and punitive damages for . . . injuries and losses.”\n\nC.     OVERVIEW OF THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE\n\n   Our inquiry proceeds from the age-old observation of Chief\nJustice Marshall that “[q]uestions, in their nature political, or\nwhich are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the exec-\nutive, can never be made in this court.” Marbury v. Madison,\n5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 170 (1803). Although the principle\nbehind the political question doctrine was announced over\ntwo hundred years ago in Marbury, the Supreme Court has\naddressed the doctrine in surprisingly few cases. See Atlee v.\nLaird, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1404384\"><a href=\"/opinion/1404384/atlee-v-laird/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Carr, the Supreme\nCourt provided its most comprehensive discussion on the\napplication of the doctrine. Recognizing that the attributes of\nthe political question doctrine “diverge, combine, appear, and\ndisappear in seeming disorderliness” in various settings, the\nCourt set out to illuminate the “contours” of the doctrine. 369\nU.S. at 210-11; see also Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional\nLaw: Principles and Policies § 2.8.1 (1997) (“In many ways,\nthe political question doctrine is the most confusing of the jus-\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                    6663\nticiability doctrines.”). The Court explained that the political\nquestion doctrine has its roots in the separation of powers and\nset forth six formulations for courts to consider in determining\nwhether they should defer a case to the political branches:\n\n    Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve\n    a political question is found [1] a textually demon-\n    strable constitutional commitment of the issue to a\n    coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judi-\n    cially discoverable and manageable standards for\n    resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding\n    without an initial policy determination of a kind\n    clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossi-\n    bility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution\n    without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate\n    branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for\n    unquestioning adherence to a political decision\n    already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrass-\n    ment from multifarious pronouncements by various\n    departments on one question.\n\n369 U.S. at 217.\n\n   [2] Dismissal on the basis of the political question doctrine\nis appropriate only if one of these formulations is “inextrica-\nble” from the case.

This overlap is not surprising given the common\nunderlying inquiry of whether the very nature of the question\nis one that can properly be decided by the judiciary.\n\n  Addressing foreign affairs specifically, Baker cautioned\nagainst “sweeping statements” that imply all questions involv-\n\f6664               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\ning foreign relations are political ones. 369 U.S. at 211 (citing\nOetjen v. Cent.

In general, however, Baker’s admoni-\ntion has proved true that most cases involving foreign affairs\nfail to fall neatly into categories on one side or the other of\nthe justiciable/nonjusticiable line. As a result, the overarching\nBaker tests remain the starting point of our inquiry.\n\n   Following Baker, the Supreme Court has not retreated from\nthe analytical framework it established. See Vieth, 124 S. Ct.\nat 1776 (reiterating Baker formulations); Davis v. Bandemer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111737\"><a href=\"/opinion/111737/davis-v-bandemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121-27 (1986) (reciting Baker formulations and\ndeclining Justice O’Connor’s implicit invitation to rethink\n\f                    ALPERIN v.

In particular, the Vieth plurality’s observation\nthat the Baker tests “are probably listed in descending order\nof both importance and certainty,” 124 S.

VATICAN BANK\nD.     THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE               AND   WORLD WAR\n       II-ERA CLAIMS\n\n   The late 1990s saw a flurry of legal activity over\nHolocaust-era claims after years of quietude. See Michael J.\nBazyler, Nuremberg in America: Litigating the Holocaust in\nUnited States Courts, 34 U. Rich. L. Rev. 1, 19 (2000) (“A\ntotal of ten cases involving Holocaust-era claims were filed in\nthe United States between the end of World War II and Octo-\nber 1996, the start of the new era of Holocaust-claim litiga-\ntion.”).7 The cases break down into several categories: finding\nof justiciability, finding of no justiciability, and skirting the\npolitical question doctrine or not reaching the doctrine.\n\n   The Eleventh Circuit’s recent decision involving claims\nagainst banks falls into the first category. The court held that\nclaims against two German banks that profited from the prac-\ntice of Aryanization during World War II were not political\nquestions. See Ungaro-Banages v. Dresdner Bank AG, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76720\"><a href=\"/opinion/76720/ursula-ungaro-benages-v-dresdner-bank-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1235-37 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n    In contrast, the district court in this case relied heavily on\nlitigation in federal district courts in New Jersey in which the\ncourts determined that various Holocaust claims raised non-\njusticiable political questions.8 See Burger-Fischer v. Degussa\n  7\n     In addition to Michael Bazyler’s comprehensive review of Holocaust-\nera litigation, Burt Neuborne, counsel to various parties in Holocaust liti-\ngation, provides a helpful overview of the path of these cases. See Burt\nNeuborne, Preliminary Reflections on Aspects of Holocaust-era Litigation\nin American Courts, 80 Wash. U. L.Q. 795 (2002).\n   8\n     The Holocaust Survivors argue that it was improper for the district\ncourt to rely on these out-of-circuit district court cases. Although these\ncases cannot be viewed as precedent, it certainly was not improper for the\ndistrict court to reference them and consider analogous principles. See\nHart v.

In Deutsch, we\ndid not, however, reject the New Jersey cases wholesale but rather criti-\ncized the district court for invoking the political question doctrine when\nall that was required was “the simple application of the requirements of\na treaty to which the United States is a party.” Id.\n\f                      ALPERIN v.

DISCUSSION\n\n   On appeal, the Holocaust Survivors address the first, sec-\nond, and sixth Baker tests. The Vatican Bank maintains that\nthe Holocaust Survivors’ claims present political questions\nunder all of the Baker tests. Because any single test can be\ndispositive, we address each in our discussion. Just as signifi-\ncantly, while we agree with the district court that certain types\nof claims arising out of World War II are properly left to the\npolitical branches, we take a surgical approach rather than a\nbroad brush in benchmarking the Baker formulations against\nthe individual claims. It is incumbent upon us to examine\neach of the claims with particularity.\n\n   The dissent would have the political question doctrine\nremove from our courts “all matters that fall by their constitu-\ntional DNA into this sphere [of conduct involving foreign\nrelations].” Dissent at 6705. This over-inclusive approach\nthreatens to sweep all cases touching foreign relations beyond\nthe purview of the courts—a practice warned against in\nBaker. See 369 U.S. at 210-11 (“Much confusion results from\nthe capacity of the ‘political question’ label to obscure the\nneed for case-by-case inquiry.”).

Recovery for lost and looted prop-\nerty, however, stands in stark contrast to the broad allegations\ntied to the Vatican Bank’s alleged assistance to the war objec-\ntives of the Ustasha, including the slave labor claims, which\nessentially call on us to make a retroactive political judgment\nas to the conduct of war (the “War Objectives Claims”). Such\njudgment calls are, by nature, political questions. With this\nbifurcation as a framework, we first address the Property\nClaims.\n\nA.    PROPERTY CLAIMS\n\n  None of the Baker formulations are inextricable from the\nProperty Claims. Simply because a foreign bank is involved\nand the case arises out of a “politically charged” context does\nnot transform the Property Claims into political questions. See\nKadic v.

The\ncourt rejected Austria’s argument, as amicus curiae, that the\ncourt should not hear the case because of the political ques-\ntion doctrine. Id. at *38 (determining that none of the six\nBaker formulations was present). Although the claim was in\nrem in nature, rather than for damages, the consideration\nunder Baker’s first test is the same.\n\n   [5] As with Portrait of Wally and Altmann, the Property\nClaims ultimately boil down to whether the Vatican Bank is\nwrongfully holding assets. Deciding this sort of controversy\nis exactly what courts do. The presence of a foreign defendant\nwith some relationship to a foreign government and claims\nstemming from World War II atrocities tinge this case with\npolitical overtones, but the underlying property issues are not\n“political questions” that are constitutionally committed to the\npolitical branches.\n\n   The dissent’s rhetoric aside, the question here is whether\nthe suit should be stopped dead because of the political ques-\ntion doctrine. If Judge Trott contests the broad jurisdiction of\nU.S. courts to hear suits involving foreigners, or the scope of\nthe FSIA—issues that are not even presented at this stage of\nthe proceeding—then his recourse is with Congress, not a\nquarrel with the majority. Our holding does not, as the dissent\ncontends, “extend[ ] the concept of judicial authority into\nunknown territory and mistakenly exercise[ ] power and com-\npetence that plainly belongs to the President and to Con-\ngress.” Dissent at 6715-16. Nor does it raise the spectre of a\n“World Court . . . with breathtaking and limitless jurisdiction\nto entertain the World’s failures.” Dissent at 6712. Rather, we\nhold true to a fundamental principle behind our separation of\npowers design, namely that “[i]t is emphatically the province\nand duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”\nMarbury, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177.

JUDICIALLY         DISCOVERABLE           AND       MANAGEABLE\n        STANDARDS\n\n   The Supreme Court discussed the second Baker test at\nlength last term in Vieth. The plurality explained that political\ngerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable because no judi-\ncially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating\nsuch claims exist: “One of the most obvious limitations\nimposed by that requirement is that judicial action must be\ngoverned by standard, by rule.” 124 S. Ct. at 1777. In\nresponse to Justice Kennedy’s concern that the plurality’s\ndecision was premature,13 Justice Scalia replied, “But it is the\nfunction of the courts to provide relief, not hope.” Id. at 1791.\nThe crux of this inquiry is thus not whether the case is unman-\nageable in the sense of being large, complicated, or otherwise\ndifficult to tackle from a logistical standpoint. Rather, courts\nmust ask whether they have the legal tools to reach a ruling\nthat is “principled, rational, and based upon reasoned distinc-\ntions.” Id. at 1777.\n\n  In conducting this inquiry, the refusal of five Justices in\nVieth to hold that no manageable standard existed despite\nwhat the plurality termed “[e]ighteen years of essentially\n  13\n     Abiding by the rule that when “no single rationale explaining the\nresult enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be\nviewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the\njudgments on the narrowest grounds,” Marks v.

Although\nagreeing with the majority that the Court should refrain from intervention\nin the case at bar, Justice Kennedy declined to join the plurality in holding\nthat all political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable. Vieth, 124\nS. Ct. at 1793 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“I would not foreclose all possi-\nbility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to\ncorrect an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting\ncases.”).\n\f6678               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\npointless litigation,” id. at 1792, counsels against holding a\ncase nonjusticiable under the second Baker test without first\nundertaking an exhaustive search for applicable standards. See\nid. at 1795-96 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (calling for “err[ing]\non the side of caution” in refraining from concluding that no\nmanageable standards will emerge in the future). As Justice\nGinsburg optimistically wrote, although “courts have been\ntrying to devise practical criteria for political gerrymandering\nfor nearly 20 years” without reaching a workable solution, “I\ndo not accept it as sound counsel for despair.” Id. at 1815-16\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n\n   The district court determined that the second Baker test\nrequired dismissal, explaining that the Holocaust Survivors’\ncase presents “intractable problems,” including the task of\nidentifying and notifying potential class members, the “multi-\ntude of sources” from which relevant materials would be\ngathered, and the likelihood that the parties would be able to\ngather all of the “pertinent data.” It is not surprising that the\ndistrict court zeroed in on “manageable standards” for decid-\ning the case. The Baker language is not crystal clear in this\nregard and, understandably, other courts have similarly\nfocused on case management. See, e.g., Iwanowa, 67\nF. Supp. 2d at 488-89 (“[T]he relevant materials come from a\nmultitude of sources, which . . . are voluminous and poten-\ntially unmanageable for individual courts to handle.”)\n\n   Lest there be any doubt, Vieth refines and redirects the\ninquiry. In light of the Court’s clarification in Vieth, we take\na slightly different approach to interpreting the phrase “judi-\ncially discoverable and manageable standards.” Instead of\nfocusing on the logistical obstacles, we ask whether the courts\nare capable of granting relief in a reasoned fashion or, on the\nother hand, whether allowing the Property Claims to go for-\nward would merely provide “hope” without a substantive\nlegal basis for a ruling. See Vieth, 124 S. Ct. at 1791. We con-\nclude that there are sound bases for providing relief.\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6679\n   The Holocaust Survivors’ most straightforward claims\ninvolve identifiable personal property for which federal stat-\nutes, common law, state law, and well-established case law\nprovide concrete legal bases for courts to reach a reasoned\ndecision. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(3) (providing an\nexpropriation exception to sovereign immunity in certain\ncases involving “rights in property taken in violation of inter-\nnational law”); Altmann, 124 S. Ct. at 2245 (asserting juris-\ndiction under the FSIA’s expropriation exception for return of\nartwork taken by Nazi forces); Gruber v. Pac.

More difficult is tracking\ngold, silver, and other fungible assets, like money, especially\nthose without bank account records or other reliable docu-\nmentation. We are well aware that the Holocaust Survivors\nhave a difficult task ahead of them in establishing the path\nthat the looted funds followed. See Ustasha Treasury Report,\nsupra note 3, at 154-55 (“The Croatian delegation [at the Lon-\ndon Conference on Nazi Gold held in December 1997] stated\nthat there were 22 lists specifying the gold [of the Ustasha],\nbut the lists have not been found, and further documentation\nregarding the gold was assumed to be with the National Bank\nof Yugoslavia.”); id. at 155 (“There is some evidence that at\nleast part of the Croat Foreign Ministry archives was sent to\nthe Vatican at the end of the War.”). These looming evidenti-\nary and proof obstacles do not change the fact that, at heart,\nthe Holocaust Survivors seek compensation for stolen prop-\nerty, a claim that is very familiar in our courts.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. As with every prospective\nclass action, this one must pass through the Rule 23 filter, a\nprocess that could preclude the class or perhaps result in the\nreshaping of the class or in some other modification of the\ndispute. Concerns about class composition and size, as well as\nquestions about access to relevant documents, should be left\nto Rule 23 proceedings and the discovery process.\n\n   Accordingly, the district court was misplaced in its reliance\non the somewhat anachronistic Kelberine v.

Without mentioning the political\nquestion doctrine, the court explained, “The procedure sought\n—adjudication of some two hundred thousand claims for mul-\ntifarious damages inflicted twenty to thirty years ago in a\nEuropean area by a government then in power—is too com-\nplicated, too costly, to justify undertaking by a court without\nlegislative provision of the means wherewith to proceed.” Id.\nMost significantly, Kelberine does not address the second\nBaker test. Nor can Kelberine serve as a guide to logistical\ninfringement.\n\n   Since Kelberine was decided in 1966, the class action land-\nscape has changed dramatically.

Kelberine was also\ndecided prior to creation of the Manual for Complex Litiga-\ntion which, first published in 1969, is now in its fourth incar-\nnation. See Fed. Judicial Ctr., Manual For Complex\nLitigation, Fourth (2004). This manual offers “an array of liti-\ngation management techniques and procedures,” and recog-\nnizes that due to the presence of much “sparsely charted\nterrain[,] . . . judges are encouraged to be innovative and cre-\native to meet the needs of their cases.” Id. at 2-3.\n\n   While acknowledging the innovative and creative means\nthat the judiciary has employed to tackle class actions, we are\nwell aware that this is a behemoth of a case. Even so, courts\nhave repeatedly risen to the challenge of handling cases\ninvolving international elements as well as massive, complex\nclass actions. See generally Kenneth R. Feinberg, Reporting\nFrom the Front Line — One Mediator’s Experience With\nMass Torts, 31 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 359, 371 (1998) (discussing\n“some of the practical problems which arise in attempting to\nresolve [mass tort] litigation and the pragmatic solutions\noffered to deal with these problems”). Courts also have fash-\nioned innovative solutions to surmount similar obstacles in\nthe Holocaust-claims context. See, e.g., D’Amato v. Deutsche\nBank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771571\"><a href=\"/opinion/771571/alfonse-m-damato-special-master-harold-watman-on-behalf-of-himself-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82 (2d Cir. 2001) (explaining in class\naction against German and Austrian banks that “the notice\ncampaign also utilized newspaper advertisements, direct mail-\ning to organizations throughout the world, and a world wide\nweb home page”); In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., 105\nF. Supp. 2d at 147 (noting in context of reviewing settlement\nagreement that “some 550,000 Initial Questionnaires had been\nreceived from class members worldwide”). Our conclusion\nthat this case is judicially “manageable” does not diminish our\nunderstanding that burdening a district court with a case of\nthis magnitude and complexity may prove to present a Sisy-\nphean task: Just when the court appears to be making progress\ntowards reaching legal peace, the rock rolls back down and\nthe court must tackle the next issue.\n\f6682               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   [7] The Holocaust Survivors unrealistically “anticipate that\nthere will be no difficulty in the management of this litiga-\ntion.” Of course there will be litigation management difficul-\nties, but that does not mean that courts “lack . . . judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards” for resolving the\nProperty Claims. Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. Concerns about\nclass certification, discovery, and allocation, among other\nissues, are matters to be resolved at a later time. Today we\nconclude only that a legal framework exists by which courts\ncan evaluate these claims in a reasoned manner.\n\fALPERIN v.

INITIAL POLICY DETERMINATION\n\n   [8] Nor do we think that adjudicating the Property Claims\nwill be impossible “without [making] an initial policy deter-\nmination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.” Baker,\n369 U.S. at 217. The Property Claims focus on the extent to\nwhich the Holocaust Survivors were wrongfully deprived of\npersonal property and the value of such property that was\ntransferred to the Vatican Bank. Adjudicating these discrete\nissues will not require the court to make pronouncements on\nforeign policy or otherwise trigger the third Baker test. Cf.\nAktepe, 105 F.3d at 1404 (wrongful death claims arising out\nof a NATO training exercise raised nonjusticiable political\nquestions in part because a decision would require “a policy\ndetermination regarding the necessity of simulating actual\nbattle conditions”).\n\n4.        LACK OF RESPECT FOR COORDINATE BRANCHES\n\n   The fourth Baker test requires us to consider whether it\nwould be impossible for the courts to resolve the Property\nClaims without expressing a lack of respect for the political\nbranches. See Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. As evidenced by the\nVatican’s protest to the State Department, this case implicates\nforeign relations. Whether the court’s involvement would\ninevitably express a lack of respect for the Executive\nBranch’s handling of U.S.-Vatican relations,14 as well as rela-\ntions with other foreign states, is a separate matter.15 We con-\nclude that judicial handling of the Property Claims will not\nrun afoul of this fourth test.\n     14\n     The United States and the Vatican established diplomatic relations on\nJanuary 10, 1984. Vatican Background Note, supra note 2.\n  15\n     In addition to relations with the Vatican, we recognize that, theoreti-\ncally, this case could bear on the United States’ relationship with Croatia,\nas well as other countries. But this theoretical possibility—even if com-\nmon sense—does not dictate the confines of a political question.\n\f6688                ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n   More than four years have passed since the Vatican sent its\nprotest to the State Department. The Holocaust Survivors rep-\nresented to the court that the State Department has been\napprised of this appeal but has said that its decision not to\nintervene is not reflective of its view on the merits of this\ncase.\n\n   [9] Had the State Department expressed a view, that fact\nwould certainly weigh in evaluating this fourth Baker formu-\nlation. In Altmann, the Court explained that “should the State\nDepartment choose to express its opinion on the implications\nof exercising jurisdiction over particular petitioners in con-\nnection with their alleged conduct, that opinion might well be\nentitled to deference as the considered judgment of the Execu-\ntive on a particular question of foreign policy.” 124 S. Ct. at\n2255 (footnote omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. § 517 (“The\nSolicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice,\nmay be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district\nin the United States to attend to the interests of the United\nStates in a suit pending in a court of the United States . . . .”).\nIt is unclear, however, how courts should construe executive\nsilence. We are not mind readers. And, thus, we cannot dis-\ncern whether the State Department’s decision not to intervene\nis an implicit endorsement, an objection, or simple indiffer-\nence. At best, this silence is a neutral factor.\n\n   A few weeks after Altmann was decided, the Supreme\nCourt considered “a policy of case-specific deference to the\npolitical branches” as a possible limitation on the determina-\ntion whether an international norm is sufficiently definite to\nsupport a cause of action. Sosa, 124 S. Ct. at 2766 n.21. The\nCourt saw no need to apply this policy in Sosa. Nonetheless,\nthe Court pointed to “several class actions” pending in federal\ndistrict court seeking damages from corporations in connec-\ntion with South Africa’s former apartheid regime. Id.

Bettauer, The Role of the United States\nGovernment In Recent Holocaust Claims Resolution, Keynote\nAddress at the Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium 2001 (Mar.\n8-9, 2001), in 20 Berkeley J. Int’l L. 1, 10 (2002). Such gov-\nernment involvement is not limited to a specified period dur-\ning the judicial process, such as the motion to dismiss stage.\nCf. Kadic, 70 F.3d at 250 (describing statement of interest\nfiled by the government after oral argument on appeal).\nAccordingly, going forward, we respect the political\nbranches’ right to weigh in and to play a role in the resolution\nof the Holocaust Survivors’ claims. See generally Neuborne,\nsupra note 7, at 796 (analogizing process of resolving\nHolocaust-era claims to a “three-legged stool” made up of\nclass action litigation, diplomacy, and community involve-\nment). Given the Executive Branch’s continuing silence on\nthe Holocaust Survivors’ claims, however, we follow Sosa’s\nlead that at this time “we need not apply here . . . a policy of\ncase-specific deference to the political branches.” 124 S. Ct.\nat 2766 n.21.\n\n   This case will proceed with foreign relations considerations\nas a backdrop, and the district court should and “can consider\nthe nation’s foreign policy interests and international comity\nconcerns in [its] decisions.” Ungaro-Banages, 379 F.3d at\n1237; see also Abu Ali v.

Despite these delicate consider-\nations, the district court is fully capable of resolving the Prop-\nerty Claims without expressing a lack of respect for the\npolitical branches.\n\n  5.   ADHERENCE TO A POLICY DECISION\n\n   [11] We see no concern that judicial handling of the Prop-\nerty Claims will involve “an unusual need for unquestioning\nadherence to a political decision already made.” Baker, 369\nU.S. at 217; cf. Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 50 (concluding that\nthe fifth Baker test did not bar adjudication “because no prior\npolitical decisions are questioned—or even implicated—by\nthe matter before us”). Indeed, this case is before us not\nbecause the Holocaust Survivors disagree with a political\ndecision made regarding their claims, but rather because there\nsimply has been no decision.

MULTIFARIOUS PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n   [12] The only question remaining is whether adjudicating\nthe Property Claims would “cause the potentiality of embar-\nrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various\ndepartments on one question.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 217; see\nalso Japan Whaling Ass’n., 478 U.S. at 230 (rejecting argu-\nment that the Court should defer adjudication on the basis of\nthe sixth Baker test). On the contrary, this case is marked by\n\f6692               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nthe absence of “pronouncements” by the political branches\nregarding the resolution of claims to the Ustasha treasury.\n\n    We reject the Vatican Bank’s argument that despite this\nvacuum, any adjudication of the Holocaust Survivors’ claims\nwould cause potential embarrassment because it would be\ninconsistent with the political branches’ stated intent to\nresolve claims arising out of World War II by way of inter-\ngovernmental negotiations and diplomacy. See Garamendi,\n539 U.S. at 421 (explaining that the “consistent Presidential\nforeign policy has been to encourage European governments\nand companies to volunteer settlement funds in preference to\nlitigation or coercive sanctions”).\n\n   [13] We are mindful of stepping on the toes of the political\nbranches, but we disagree that any adjudication of the claims\nwould implicate this final test. As discussed with regard to the\nWar Objectives Claims, the district court should refrain from\nhearing those claims that require passing judgment on foreign\npolicy decisions. On the other hand, fulfilling our\nconstitutionally-mandated role to hear controversies properly\nbefore us does not threaten to cause embarrassment or multi-\nple pronouncements. Cf. Johnson v.

No ongoing government negotiations, agree-\nments, or settlements are on the horizon. The outside chance\nthat the Executive Branch will issue a statement in the future\nthat has the “potentiality of embarrassment” when viewed\nagainst our decision today does not justify foreclosing the\nHolocaust Survivors’ claims, especially when “[t]he age and\nhealth of many of the class members also presses for a prompt\n\f                       ALPERIN v.

It is\nnot our role to sit in judgment as to whether the perceived\nCommunist threat justified assisting alleged war criminals.\nRather, we are mindful of the Supreme Court’s admonition\nthat it is up to the political branches to come to terms with\nthese “delicate [and] complex” foreign policy decisions “for\nwhich the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor respon-\nsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain\nof political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.”\nChicago & S.

The exact\nnature of the slave labor claims against the Vatican Bank is\n\f                       ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                        6697\nnot entirely clear from the Complaint. The Holocaust Survi-\nvors allege that class members share a common question of\nfact whether “Defendants were directly and/or indirectly\ninvolved with the . . . conversion of . . . Plaintiffs’ labor” and\nfurther allege that “Defendants have failed to . . . pay to Plain-\ntiffs . . . the value of slave labor performed.” Although the\nComplaint maintains that many of the Ustasha officials were\nRoman Catholic clergy, it does not indicate that the Vatican\nBank itself directly exploited the slave labor. Unlike cases in\nwhich the defendants were the enslaving entities, the slave\nlabor claims against the Vatican Bank are, in effect, derivative\nclaims: The Ustasha profited from slave labor, these profits\nbenefitted the Ustasha treasury, and portions of these tainted\nfunds were transferred to the Vatican Bank. Cf. Deutsch, 324\nF.3d at 704 (plaintiffs “were forced to work as slaves” for\ndefendant corporation); Iwanowa, 67 F. Supp. 2d at 431\n(defendants forced plaintiffs “to perform forced labor under\ninhuman conditions”).\n\n   [16] Determining whether the Vatican Bank was unjustly\nenriched by profits derived from slave labor would therefore\nnecessitate that we look behind the Vatican Bank and indict\nthe Ustasha regime for its wartime conduct.18 We are not will-\ning to take this leap. Condemning—for its wartime actions—\na foreign government with which the United States was at war\nwould require us to “review[ ] an exercise of foreign policy\njudgment by the coordinate political branch to which author-\nity to make that judgment has been ‘constitutional[ly] com-\n  18\n     In rejecting the Holocaust Survivors’ slave labor claims, we distin-\nguish profits derived from slave labor from those derived from investing\nseized assets. In the former case, the court would need to evaluate the\nUstasha’s wartime use of slave labor, quantify the monetary value of this\nlabor, and then determine the portion thereof that flowed to the Vatican\nBank. In contrast, if the Holocaust Survivors can surmount the daunting\nevidentiary obstacles and establish that seized assets came to rest with the\nVatican Bank, then the Property Claims could encompass both the value\nof the assets themselves as well as any profits earned by the Vatican Bank\nfrom the subsequent investment of the seized assets.\n\f6698                   ALPERIN v.

It is not our place to\nspeak for the U.S. Government by declaring that a foreign\ngovernment is at fault for using forced labor during World\nWar II. Any such policy condemning the Ustasha regime must\nfirst emanate from the political branches.\n\n   Our conclusion that the slave labor claims are not justicia-\nble comports with our decision in Deutsch. The two cases are\nsuperficially similar in that they address the same general sub-\nject matter of Holocaust-era slave labor claims. In Deutsch,\nhowever, we based our holding on federal-state relations\nrather than separation of powers concerns.19 324 F.3d at 705-\n16.

VATICAN BANK                        6699\ndling in matters reserved to the political branches and not\nbecause this result is compelled by treaties.\n\n   Nor does our decision conflict with the Second Circuit’s\nreasoning in Kadic, a case which, in addition to geographic\nparallels, involved claims tied to similar genocidal acts. See\n70 F.3d at 236-37. In Kadic, Croats and Muslims brought suit\nagainst Radovan Karadzic under the ATS alleging that he\noversaw the genocidal campaign conducted by Bosnian-Serb\nmilitary forces. Id. In holding that the claims were not barred\nby the political question doctrine, the court cautioned that\n“judges should not reflexively invoke the[ ] doctrine[ ] to\navoid difficult and somewhat sensitive decisions in the con-\ntext of human rights.” Id. at 249. We agree. Unlike in Kadic,\nhowever, we think that “weigh[ing] carefully the relevant\nconsiderations” at stake in this particular case, adjudicating\nthe slave labor claims in the context presented here would\n“compromis[e] the primacy of the political branches in for-\neign affairs.” Id. Not only did the State Department “ex-\npressly disclaim[ ] any concern that the political question\ndoctrine should be invoked” in Kadic, id. at 250, but the\nclaims in Kadic focused on the acts of a single individual dur-\ning a localized conflict rather than asking the court to under-\ntake the complex calculus of assigning fault for actions taken\nby a foreign regime during the morass of a world war. The\nslave labor claims present no mere tort suit. On the contrary,\nthese claims fundamentally rest on “controversies which\nrevolve around policy choices and value determinations con-\nstitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of Congress\nor the confines of the Executive Branch.” Japan Whaling\nAss’n, 478 U.S. at 230.\n\n   [18] Our decision to affirm the district court’s dismissal of\nthe War Objectives Claims is not a result we reach lightly.20\n  20\n    We caution that our holding does not signify that slave labor claims\nautomatically raise issues that are committed to the political branches. As\nwith all claims, this determination must be based on the circumstances of\n\f6700                  ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nWe do not wish to imply in the slightest that these claims do\nnot represent gravely serious harms for which the Holocaust\nSurvivors deserve relief. The difficulty is that relief lies else-\nwhere. As the court observed in In re Austrian and German\nBank Holocaust Litigation, “Those persecuted by the Nazis\nwere the victims of unspeakable acts of inhumanity. At the\nsame time, however, it must be understood that the law is a\ntool of limited capacity. Not every wrong, even the worst, is\ncognizable as a legal claim.” 80 F. Supp. 2d at 177. In this\ncase, the Holocaust Survivors must look to the political\nbranches for resolution of the War Objectives Claims which,\nat base, are political questions.\n\n                          III.   CONCLUSION\n\n   We REVERSE the district court’s grant of the Vatican\nBank’s motion to dismiss with regard to the Holocaust Survi-\nvors’ Property Claims for conversion, unjust enrichment, res-\ntitution, and an accounting. We AFFIRM the district court’s\ngrant of the Vatican Bank’s motion to dismiss with regard to\nall other claims in the Complaint, specifically the War Objec-\ntives Claims.

See, e.g., In re African-American, 304 F. Supp. 2d at\n1056-60 (concluding that slave reparation claims were not justiciable in\npart because “reparations to former slaves following the Civil War[ ] was\nconsidered and rejected by the Representative Branches”).\n\f                    ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                  6701\none made by Judge McKeown in her well written opinion.\nNevertheless, and with all due respect to my esteemed col-\nleagues, I find part of their analysis unconvincing. In the\nmain, the segregation for analytical purposes of the plaintiffs’\nclaims into two distinct groups — “Property Claims” as dis-\ntinguished from “War Objective Claims” — splits the atom\nwhere it is not divisible. In this respect, I agree with the\ndefendants/appellees: “All claims asserted by plaintiffs are\n‘inextricably intertwined’ with the Executive Branch’s powers\nover war-related crimes, such that the judiciary is powerless\nto adjudicate them.” Accordingly, although I agree that the\nso-called War Objective Claims are not justiciable, I respect-\nfully dissent as to the others.\n\n   I concur in and adopt the district court’s view that appel-\nlants’ complaint unmistakably and inextricably raises issues\nthat our Constitution commits to the legislative and executive\nbranches of our government, not to the judiciary.

The Baker court\nrepeated this “clearly settled” principle, which emanates from\nour Constitution’s careful allocation and separation of powers\nbetween our three branches, and in so doing identified “for-\n\f6702               ALPERIN v.

In elaboration of this doctrine, the Oetjen court said,\n\n       The principle that the conduct of one independent\n    government cannot be successfully questioned in the\n    courts of another is as applicable to a case involving\n    the title to property brought within the custody of a\n    court, such as we have here, as it was held to be to\n    the cases cited, in which claims for damages were\n    based upon acts done in a foreign country, for it rests\n    at last upon the highest considerations of interna-\n    tional comity and expediency. To permit the validity\n    of the acts of one sovereign state to be reexamined\n    and perhaps condemned by the courts of another\n    would very certainly “imperil the amicable relations\n    between governments and vex the peace of nations.”\n\n246 U.S. at 303-04.\n\n   One of the earliest cases involving the respective authority\nof courts and Congress appears to be United States v. Palmer,\n16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610 (1818), a case involving inter alia a\nrobbery committed on the high seas by a non-citizen on board\na ship belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state. The\nCourt held (1) that a specific act of Congress criminalizing\npiracy did not give authority to our federal courts to take cog-\nnizance of, try, and punish such an act on the high seas as rob-\nbery, and (2) that the courts are not empowered to so act\nwithout authority from Congress. Id. at 633-35. In explanation\nof this decision, Chief Justice Marshall said,\n\f               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                     6703\nThose questions which respect the rights of a part of\na foreign empire, which asserts, and is contending\nfor its independence, and the conduct which must be\nobserved by the courts of the union towards the sub-\njects of such section of an empire who may be\nbrought before the tribunals of this country, are\nequally delicate and difficult.\n\n    As it is understood that the construction which has\nbeen given to the act of Congress, will render a par-\nticular answer to them unnecessary, the court will\nonly observe, that such questions are generally rather\npolitical than legal in their character. They belong\nmore properly to those who can declare what the\nlaw shall be; who can place the nation in such a\nposition with respect to foreign powers as to their\nown judgment shall appear wise; to whom are\nentrusted all its foreign relations; than to that tribu-\nnal whose power as well as duty is confined to the\napplication of the rule which the legislature may\nprescribe for it. In such contests a nation may\nengage itself with the one party or the other — may\nobserve absolute neutrality — may recognize the\nnew state absolutely — or may make a limited rec-\nognition of it. The proceeding in courts must depend\nso entirely on the course of the government, that it\nis difficult to give a precise answer to questions\nwhich do not refer to a particular nation. It may be\nsaid, generally, that if the government remains neu-\ntral, and recognizes the existence of a civil war, its\ncourts cannot consider as criminal those acts of hos-\ntility which war authorizes, and which the new gov-\nernment may direct against its enemy. To decide\notherwise, would be to determine that the war prose-\ncuted by one of the parties was unlawful, and would\nbe to arrange the nation to which the court belongs\nagainst that party. This would transcend the limits\nprescribed to the judicial department.\n\f6704               ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\nId. at 634-35 (emphasis added).\n\n  The Court registered a similar observation in Foster v. Neil-\nson:\n\n       In a controversy between two nations concerning\n    national boundary, it is scarcely possible that the\n    courts of either should refuse to abide by the mea-\n    sures adopted by its own government. There being\n    no common tribunal to decide between them, each\n    determines for itself on its own rights, and if they\n    cannot adjust their differences peaceably, the right\n    remains with the strongest. The judiciary is not that\n    department of the government to which the assertion\n    of its interests against foreign powers is confided;\n    and its duty commonly is to decide upon individual\n    rights, according to those principles which the polit-\n    ical departments of the nation have established.\n\n27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 307-08 (1829), overruled on other\ngrounds by United States v. Percheman, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 51\n(1833) (emphasis added).\n\n   The Supreme Court has spoken frequently about this issue,\nand each time it has reiterated the structural and prudential\nproposition that the “President also possesses in his own right\ncertain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as\nCommander-in-Chief and as the Nation’s organ in foreign\naffairs.” Chicago & S.

Accordingly, the Court has made\nit clear that\n\n    the very nature of executive decisions as to foreign\n    policy is political, not judicial.

With all respect to my valued colleagues,\nI see it as a mistake to measure this issue of justifiability by\na “this lawsuit is the only game in town” standard. This is not\nour “game,” period, and we do not become vested with juris-\ndiction by default of the other branches. The majority opinion\nindicates that Executive silence is somehow relevant.

The non-existence of\nan executive agreement is meaningless.\n\n   Notwithstanding appellants’ lawyers’ ability to cast this\ndispute in “garden-variety” legal terms, i.e., conversion,\nunjust enrichment, restitution, etc., the ineffable fact remains\nthat this functionally is a lawsuit against (1) the Vatican itself,\n(2) the Vatican Bank, which is an instrumentality of the sov-\nereign state of the Vatican, and (3) untold others — including\nprobably the Pope — seeking relief for World War II wrongs\nagainst foreigners committed by the Nazis and their allies in\nEurope almost sixty years ago.

His-\n    torically, at the end of a war, there has always been\n    a declaration of victorious nations and defeated\n    nations. As part of that process, the victorious\n    nations invariably discuss the reparations that the\n    defeated nations must pay to compensate the prevail-\n    ing countries and their nationals for the loss that the\n    aggressor country has caused. The nature of war is\n    such that the governments of the victorious nations\n    determine and negotiate the resolution of the claims\n    of their nationals by way of agreements between the\n    nations involved or affected by the war. This is evi-\n    dent from the reparations provisions in the Treaty of\n    Versailles following World War I, and the discussion\n    of reparations in the Yalta Conference, the Potsdam\n    Conference and the Paris Reparations Treaty at the\n    end of World War II. More recently, at the end of the\n    Gulf War, the United Nations established an interna-\n    tional claims resolution tribunal to resolve claims\n    against Iraq. See Elyse J. Garmise, The Iraqi Claims\n    Process and the Ghost of Versailles, 67\n    N.Y.U.L.Rev. 840, 841 (1992). Thus, it is evident\n    that responsibility for resolving forced labor claims\n    arising out of a war is constitutionally committed to\n    the political branches of government, not the judi-\n    ciary.\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                   6707\n   In a footnote to this discussion, the court observed that the\n“ ‘concept of reparations encompasses all international law\nclaims for compensation related to war [including] individual\nclaims by injured citizens of victorious powers.’ ” Id. at 485\nn.84 (quoting Ministerial Director Horst Teltschik).\n\n   When California attempted by legislation to insert itself\ninto Holocaust-era insurance policies, the Supreme Court\nstepped in and held that California’s law was preempted\nbecause it interfered with the President’s conduct of our\nNation’s foreign policy.

Although the source of the\n    President’s power to act in foreign affairs does not\n    enjoy any textual detail, the historical gloss on the\n    “executive Power” vested in Article II of the Consti-\n    tution has recognized the President’s “vast share of\n    responsibility for the conduct of our foreign rela-\n    tions.”\n\nAm.

It did not choose, however,\n    to incorporate into that resolution a private right of\n    action against our wartime enemies or their nation-\n    als. The United States resolved the war against Ger-\n    many by becoming a party to a number of treaties\n    and international agreements, beginning with the\n    1945 agreements at Yalta and Potsdam, in which the\n    United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed\n    to extract reparations from Germany and its nation-\n    als but did not include a private right of action\n    against either. . . . Most recently, the Foundation\n    Agreement of July 17, 2000, an executive agreement\n    between the governments of Germany and the\n    United States, provided a limited form of remedy for\n    claimants such as Deutsch.\n\n   I would add that we entered into a similar treaty with Italy\nin 1947.

Moreover,\n    plaintiffs seek such recovery out of an undivided\n    portion of the Ustasha Treasury transferred to the\n    IOR. Such claims require a review of materials from\n    a multitude of foreign sources that, “by sheer bulk\n    alone,” are likely to be unmanageable. See Atlee, 347\n    F. Supp. [689, 701 (E.D. Pa. 1972)]. Compounding\n    the problem, “there is a distinct possibility that the\n    parties might not be able to compile all of the rele-\n    vant information, thus making any attempt to justify\n    a ruling on the merits of an issue that will affect the\n    nation difficult and imprudent.” See Iwanowa, 67\n    F.

Supp. at 702 (noting “the inherent\n    inability of a court to predict the international conse-\n    quences flowing from a decision on the merits.”)\n    Further, plaintiffs’ claims require this Court to\n    resolve the competing rights to the Ustasha Treasury\n    of potentially hundreds of thousands of citizens of\n    various nations, funds as to which any number of\n    persons harmed by the Ustasha regime, both repre-\n    sented and not represented in these proceedings,\n    might equally assert a claim.\n\f6712               ALPERIN v.

Based on my experi-\nence with litigation involving foreign nations, it will be just\na matter of time until the State and Justice Departments are\ndragged into this case as the district court begins to reach out\nfor evidence and witnesses and to exercise its power to\nenforce its orders.\n\n                              III\n\n   No one could possibly be comfortable identifying a barrier\nto the relief sought by these plaintiffs, persons who suffered\nsome of the most unspeakably grievous injuries to their lives\nand families. As Judge Reinhardt said in Deutsch, the Holo-\ncaust was “the most atrocious act ever perpetrated by a civi-\nlized (or uncivilized) people, an act unparalleled in history.”\n324 F.3d at 704. Nevertheless, our courts are not the appropri-\nate fora for redress. What the majority has unintentionally\naccomplished in embracing this case is nothing less than the\nwholesale creation of a World Court, an international tribunal\nwith breathtaking and limitless jurisdiction to entertain the\nWorld’s failures, no matter where they happen, when they\nhappen, to whom they happen, the identity of the wrongdoer,\nand the sovereignty of one of the parties. The consequences\nof this holding are overwhelming. I need go no deeper than\nthe third amended class action complaint to illustrate this\npoint:\n\n       1. This is a civil action arising under customary\n    international law and the laws of the United States of\n    America on behalf of named Plaintiffs and a class of\n    all Serbs, Jews, and former Soviet Union citizens\n    (and their heirs and beneficiaries), who suffered\n    physical, monetary and/or property losses including\n    slave labor, due to the systematic and brutal extermi-\n    nation of Jews, Serbs, and Romani by the Nazi pup-\n    pet Regime, The Independent State of Croatia\n\f              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                     6713\n(NDH) led by Pavelic’s Ustasha Regime, and as a\nresult of the occupation of the former Soviet Union\nby Croatian military forces in concert with their Ger-\nman occupation forces. This is an action against the\nVatican Bank, Franciscan Order and Unknown Cath-\nolic Religious Orders, Croatian Liberation Move-\nment (HOP), Swiss National Bank (SNB) and as yet\nunnamed recipients of Nazi and Ustasha Loot,\nSwiss, Austrian, Argentine, Spanish, Italian, Portu-\nguese, and German banking institutions and Califor-\nnia and other United States correspondent banks for\ntheir participation in and benefit from the Ustasha\nRegime’s acts of cruelty and violence.\n\n   2. Plaintiffs and their heirs and beneficiaries seek\naccounting, restitution, disgorgement, and to recover\ndamages arising out of the participation of Defen-\ndants, Vatican Bank or Istituto Per Le Opere Di\nReligione (hereinafter referred to as IOR), the Fran-\nciscan Order (OFM) and Unknown Catholic Reli-\ngious Orders, Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP),\nSwiss National Bank (SNB), unknown recipients of\nNazi and Ustasha loot, and other banking institutions\nand correspondent banks and religious orders and\norganizations in a common scheme and course of\nconduct: (a) to profit from, both directly and indi-\nrectly, the inhumane and genocidal system instituted\nby the Nazi-directed Ustasha Regime in Croatia and\nterritories subject to Croatian civil or military occu-\npation upon those peoples that it viewed, not as\nhuman beings, but as subhuman according to Nazi\nand Ustasha ideology; (b) to obtain, accept, conceal,\nconvert and profit from assets looted by the Ustasha\nRegime and deposited in, or liquidated through, the\nIOR, SNB, unnamed Doe Defendant Banks, and\nFranciscan Order during the ascendancy of the\nUstasha Regime and following the demise of the\nRegime at the behest of the former Ustasha and Nazi\n\f6714              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\n    leaders through the offices of the Franciscan Order;\n    and (c) to retain and convert assets deposited in their\n    institutions by the Croatian Liberation Movement,\n    Ustasha and/or the Franciscan Order and Unknown\n    Catholic Religious Orders.\n\n       3. Defendants committed, conspired to commit,\n    and aided and abetted others who committed crimes\n    against peace, war crimes and crimes against human-\n    ity. Defendants assisted the Ustasha Regime and its\n    leaders as well as prominent Nazis to successfully\n    evade justice for their genocidal crimes by conceal-\n    ing and making available the considerable assets of\n    the Ustasha Treasury.\n\n                          *   *   *\n\n       WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court:\n\n       1. Certify this action as a class action pursuant to\n    FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 23, and\n    designating named Plaintiffs as the class representa-\n    tives and counsel for Plaintiffs as Class counsel.\n\n       2. Declare that Defendants by trafficking in,\n    retaining, disposing of and concealing assets looted\n    from targets of the Ustasha Regime with knowledge\n    that the assets had been obtained through the system-\n    atic persecution, torture, slave labor, force, and mur-\n    der, violated international treaties and customary\n    international law enforceable in this Court as federal\n    common law, the law of the nations and international\n    law.\n\n      3. Order Defendants to make available all infor-\n    mation relating to the Ustasha Treasury in order that\n    an accounting of assets may be realized.\n\f                   ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK                     6715\n      4. Direct Defendants to return all identifiable\n    property looted from Plaintiffs and received by\n    Defendants.\n\n       5. Award Plaintiffs the value of any identified\n    property deposited by, or looted from, Plaintiffs and\n    received by Defendants plus interest compounded\n    annually since 1941.\n\n       6. Award Plaintiffs compensatory and punitive\n    damages arising out of Defendants’ unlawful behav-\n    ior in trafficking in, retaining, disposing and con-\n    cealing Looted Assets or profits of the Ustasha\n    Regime with knowledge that the assets or profits\n    were the fruits of Nazi-Ustasha violations of interna-\n    tional law and were used to assist war criminals to\n    evade justice.\n\n       7. Order Defendants to disgorge any profits\n    earned by trafficking in, disposing of or concealing\n    the Ustasha Treasury which was the fruits of viola-\n    tions of international law.\n\n      8. Grant Plaintiffs a jury trial on all issues so tri-\n    able.\n\n       9. Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action,\n    including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expert fees;\n    and,\n\n      10. Grant such other and further relief as shall\n    seem just to the Court.\n\n   Our unauthorized transformation of our district courts into\nan open-door international tribunal far overreaches the author-\nity of “the least dangerous branch” of our government. This\nopinion, albeit well-intentioned, extends the concept of judi-\ncial authority into unknown territory and mistakenly exercises\n\f6716              ALPERIN v. VATICAN BANK\npower and competence that plainly belongs to the President\nand to Congress. Today, it is the Vatican and the Holocaust.\nTomorrow, will it be horrors from Haiti, Cuba, Rwanda,\nSouth Africa, the Soviet Union, Bosnia, Sudan, Somalia,\nNorth Korea, Iraq, and who knows where? The majority opin-\nion sends our district judges on a crusade from which they are\nnot equipped and which is doomed to flounder. As a class\naction, it will make all others seem like cakewalks. One can\nonly wonder if the filing of this lawsuit is nothing more than\na ploy to force the President and the State Department to take\naction. Similarly, one can only wonder why the beleaguered\nState Department would stand silently by and allow this case\nto continue — in the Ninth Circuit no less, where mistakenly\nwe would have allowed the Garamendi litigation to proceed.\n\n  Thus, I respectfully disagree that Alperin’s unseverable\n“garden-variety” claims are justiciable.\n\f</pre>",
