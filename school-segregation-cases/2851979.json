          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNos. 98-2682, 98-2819 & 99-1817\n\nDale M., by his mother and next friend, Alice M.,\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellees, Cross-Appellants,\n\nv.\n\nBoard of Education of Bradley-Bourbonnais\nHigh School District No. 307, et al.,\n\nDefendants-Appellants, Cross-Appellees.\n\n\n\nAppeals from the United States District Court\nfor the Central District of Illinois.\nNo. 96-2254--Michael P. McCuskey, Judge.\n\n\nArgued June 7, 2000--Decided January 12, 2001\n\n\n\n Before Posner, Coffey, and Ripple, Circuit Judges.\n\n Posner, Circuit Judge. The district judge held\nthat a public school district in Illinois had\nviolated its duty under the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act to provide Dale M.\nwith \"a free appropriate public education that\nemphasizes special education and related services\ndesigned to meet [disabled children’s] unique\nneeds,\" where \"related services\" include\n\"transportation, and such developmental,\ncorrective, and other supportive services\n(including . . . psychological services . . .\n[and] social work services . . .) as may be\nrequired to assist a child with a disability to\nbenefit from special education.\" 20 U.S.C.\nsec.sec. 1400(d)(1)(A), 1401(22). Dale became a\nstudent in the district in 1993, when he was 14\nyears old. He soon became a serious disciplinary\nproblem. He disrupted classes and was truant. The\nfollowing year he was placed in a \"therapeutic\nday school\" designed to deal with disruptive and\ntruant students, but in his first four months he\nattended school only 20 days, though when he did\nattend he behaved himself, did the assigned work,\nand got good grades. For some time he had been\ndrinking alcohol to excess and also consuming\nmarijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs, and\nin January of 1995 he was hospitalized for\ndepression and at the same time charged with\nresidential burglary and theft of a car. He was\n\fplaced on probation for these offenses. When he\ngot out of the hospital he refused to return to\nschool, but received home instruction until\nNovember, when he was again charged with\nresidential burglary and this time sent to jail.\nHe was examined by a psychologist who found that\nDale has no learning disability but instead what\nthe psychologist called a \"conduct disorder,\"\nalong with depression and substance abuse.\n\n The school district wanted to send Dale back to\nthe therapeutic day school. Instead, his mother,\nwith whom he was living (his parents are\ndivorced), obtained Dale’s release from jail and\nplaced him in a residential school, the Elan\nSchool, in Maine. She demanded that the school\ndistrict pay for Dale’s attending Elan, as\notherwise he would not be getting the free\nappropriate public education to which he was\nentitled. The school district refused. The Elan\nSchool does not offer psychiatric or other\nmedical treatment for substance abuse or\ndepression. As far as we can determine, it’s just\na boarding school for difficult children. Dale\ndid not like the school, and was excluded from\nmost school activities because of his belligerent\nattitude.\n\n The mother sought reimbursement of the expense\nof Dale’s attending Elan. Her claim was\nadjudicated in succession by two hearing officers\nappointed by the state. The first ordered the\npublic school district to pay but the second, the\nreviewing officer, reversed the order of the\nfirst. He could find no evidence that Elan\nprovided a superior educational experience for\nDale to the therapeutic day school, let alone any\ntreatment for his \"conduct disorder\" or his\ndepression and substance abuse; it merely\nprovided confinement, thus solving the problem of\nhis truancy. The hearing officer did not think\nthat the statute required the school district to\npay for confining a truant student.\n\n The district judge reversed and ordered\nreimbursement. The school district has paid\npursuant to the district court’s order, and the\nplaintiffs argue that this makes the school\ndistrict’s appeal moot, but that is wrong. A\njudgment creditor who pays the judgment pending\nappeal instead of posting a supersedeas bond\n(which would automatically stay collection, see\nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(d)) is entitled to the return\nof its money if the decision is reversed, and so\nthe payment does not moot the appeal unless the\nappellant has relinquished his right to seek\nrepayment if he wins. In re Farrell Lines Co.,\n761 F.2d 796 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam); 11\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure sec. 2905,\n\fpp. 525-26 (2d ed.1995); cf. United States v.\nHougham, 364 U.S. 310, 312-13 (1960); United\nStates for Use and Benefit of H & S Industries,\nInc. v. F.D. Rich Co., 525 F.2d 760, 764-65 (7th\nCir. 1975). The school district has not\nrelinquished that right.\n\n So we must decide whether the district court’s\ndecision was correct. As we explained in Morton\nCommunity Unit School Dist. No. 709 v. J.M., 152\nF.3d 583, 587-88 (7th Cir. 1998), when the\ndistrict judge does not take fresh evidence but\ninstead bases his review of the hearing officer’s\ndecision on the record compiled in the\nadministrative proceedings, he is required to\ngive \"due deference\" to that decision. That is,\nthe fact that he disagrees with the officer is\nnot enough to justify setting aside the latter’s\norder; he must be strongly convinced that the\norder is erroneous. See also Board of Education\nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982); Patricia P.\nv. Board of Education, 203 F.3d 462, 466-67 (7th\nCir. 2000); Linda W. v. Indiana Dept. of\nEducation, 200 F.3d 504, 506 (7th Cir. 1999);\nBoard of Education v. Illinois State Board of\nEducation, 41 F.3d 1162, 1167 (7th Cir. 1994);\nSusan N. v. Wilson School District, 70 F.3d 751,\n757 (3d Cir. 1995). The hearing officer to whom\nthe judge is to defer is the second, that is, the\nappellate officer, Board of Education v. Illinois\nState Board of Education, 184 F.3d 912, 915 (7th\nCir. 1999); Heather S. v. Wisconsin, 125 F.3d\n1045, 1053-54 (7th Cir. 1997); Thomas v.\nCincinnati Board of Education, 918 F.2d 618, 624\n(6th Cir. 1990), just as, when the National Labor\nRelations Board reverses one of its\nadministrative law judges, the reviewing court\ndefers to the board, not to the ALJ, e.g.,\nUniversal Camera Corp. v NLRB, 340 U.S. 474\n(1951); Dilling Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 107 F.3d 521, 523-24 (7th Cir. 1997); Webco\nIndustries, Inc. v. NLRB, 217 F.3d 1306, 1311\n(10th Cir. 2000), and unlike, for example,\njudicial review of benefits determinations in\nblack lung cases, where the courts defer to the\nALJ’s decision rather than to the decision of the\nBenefits Review Board on appeal from the ALJ to\nit. E.g., Old Ben Coal Co. v. Prewitt, 755 F.2d\n588, 589-90 (7th Cir. 1985).\n\n But, by further analogy to the rule in judicial\nreview of Labor Board decisions, Universal Camera\nCorp. v NLRB, supra, 340 U.S. at 491-97; Dilling\nMechanical Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, 107\nF.3d at 524, we believe that the reviewing court,\nin deciding whether to uphold a reversal by the\nsecond hearing officer of the first hearing\nofficer’s decision, must give considerable weight\nto any credibility determinations made by the\nfirst hearing officer, since the second officer,\n\fexercising as he does an appellate rather than a\ntrial function, will generally not have been in a\nposition to second guess those determinations.\nSee Heather S. v. Wisconsin, supra, 125 F.3d at\n1053-54.\n\n Evidence was presented to the district judge, in\nthe form of affidavits and other documents\nattached to the summary-judgment papers, but\nthere is no indication in his opinion that he\nconsidered any of it. Cross-motions for summary\njudgment are the standard method for presenting a\ncase to a district court for decision on the\nrecord compiled by the administrative tribunal\nthat the court is reviewing. Patricia P. v. Board\nof Education, supra, 203 F.3d at 466; Heather S.\nv. Wisconsin, supra, 125 F.3d at 1052; Hunger v.\nLeininger, 15 F.3d 664, 669-70 (7th Cir. 1994);\nKirkpatrick v. Lenoir County Board of Education,\n216 F.3d 380, 385 (4th Cir. 2000). The grant of\nthe plaintiffs’ motion thus implied that the\njudge was not considering any evidence not\npresented in the administrative proceedings. The\nevidence that had been submitted for the first\ntime in the district court indicated, for\nexample, that after the decision by the second\nhearing officer Dale graduated from Elan. But the\njudge said that \"Dale is receiving an educational\nbenefit from Elan\" (emphasis added), implying\nthat Dale was still at the school. This is a\nfurther indication that the judge didn’t consider\nany of the new evidence.\n\n The judge recited the correct, the deferential,\nstandard of review for the case where no new\nevidence is considered (still another indication\nthat he did not consider the new evidence), but\nwhen he came to actually discuss the second\nhearing officer’s decision, he applied an\nincorrect standard. He said for example that he\n\"disagrees with the reviewing officer’s\nconclusion that Elan was inappropriate\" and \"a\npreponderance of the evidence shows that Elan is\nan appropriate placement for Dale.\" That is the\nlanguage of de novo determination of contested\nfactual issues. The judge may have been confused\nby the language of the statute: \"In any action\nbrought under this paragraph the court shall\nreceive the records of the administrative\nproceedings, shall hear additional evidence at\nthe request of a party, and, basing its decision\non the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant\nsuch relief as the court determines is\nappropriate.\" 20 U.S.C. sec. 1415(i) (2)(B). When\nthe court has before it evidence that was not\nbefore the hearing officers, the amount of\ndeference due the reviewing officer declines,\nsince the latter’s decision was based on an\nincomplete record. But when there either is no\nnew evidence or the judge for some reason doesn’t\n\fconsider it, he owes considerable deference to\nthe reviewing officer.\n\n When due deference is given that officer, we\nthink it plain that his determination that\nplacement in the Elan school was not the \"free\nappropriate education\" to which the statute\nrefers should not have been disturbed. It is true\nthat Dale has psychological problems that\ninterfered with his obtaining an education, even\nthough he has no learning disability or\nretardation. And the statute refers explicitly to\n\"psychological services\" as one type of \"related\nservices\" that the statute may require a school\ndistrict to pay for if, without them, the\ndisabled child--and we do not understand the\nschool district to be denying that Dale’s\nproblems add up to a disability within the\nmeaning of the statute, 20 U.S.C. sec. 1401(3);\n34 C.F.R. sec. 300.7; Board of Education v.\nNathan R., 199 F.3d 377, 379 n. 2 (7th Cir.\n2000); compare Rodiriecus L. v. Waukegan School\nDistrict No. 60, 90 F.3d 249, 254 (7th Cir.\n1996)--cannot obtain an education. But the Elan\nSchool does not provide psychological services,\nat least to Dale. For him all it provides is\nconfinement. He was placed in Elan not from any\nschool in the defendant school district, but from\njail. Elan is a jail substitute. An incorrigible\ntruant and lawbreaker, Dale does better in every\nrespect when he is in a custodial setting than\nwhen he lives at home.\n\n The only difference between the therapeutic day\nschool in which the school district put him (and\nwanted to return him to, despite his history of\ntruancy) and Elan is that Elan is a boarding\nschool specializing in anfractuous kids. So at\nleast the second hearing officer determined, and\nthe district court was obliged to defer to that\ndetermination, which was both supported by the\nevidence and within the presumed superior\ncompetence of the administrative process to\nresolve matters of educational policy. Hence Elan\nwas the \"appropriate\" placement for Dale, within\nthe meaning of the statute, only if confinement\nis a related service within that meaning, since\nobviously it is not an educational service. We\nthink--and this is a pure legal issue, as to\nwhich we owe no deference to the hearing officer,\nMorton Community Unit School District No. 709 v.\nJ.M., supra, 152 F.3d at 587--that it stretches\nthe statute too far to classify confinement thus.\n\n The essential distinction is between services\nprimarily oriented toward enabling a disabled\nchild to obtain an education and services\noriented more toward enabling the child to engage\nin noneducational activities. The former are\n\"related services\" within the meaning of the\n\fstatute, the latter not. Butler v. Evans, No. 99-\n3135, 2000 WL 1231053, at *4-*6 (7th Cir. Aug 31,\n2000). In our Morton case, for example, the\nmedical-support services rendered the plaintiff\nwere for the purpose of enabling him to attend\nschool. 152 F.3d at 583. In contrast, the purpose\nof the \"service\" that the school district is\nbeing asked to pay for is to keep Dale out of\njail, both directly, because the judge was\nwilling to release him from jail to Elan, and\nindirectly, because Dale is less likely to commit\nburglary and other crimes when he is in a\nresidential facility than when he is living at\nhome with only his mother to keep an eye on him.\n\n Another way to put this is that Dale’s problems\nare not primarily educational. He has the\nintelligence to perform well as a student and no\ncognitive defect or disorder such as dyslexia\nthat prevents him from applying his intelligence\nto the acquisition of an education, without\nspecial assistance. His problem is a lack of\nproper socialization, as a result of which,\ndespite his tender age, he has compiled a\nsignificant criminal record. His substance abuse\ninterferes with his schooling; that is true; but\nit interferes with much else besides, such as\nability to conform to the law and avoid jail.\nSupposing that the most effective educational\nprogram for Dale would be to take correspondence\ncourses while confined in a prison, we do not\nthink his mother would be arguing that the school\ndistrict would have to pay the prison authorities\nfor the expense of incarcerating him. But that is\nclose to what she is arguing--that since\nconfinement, among its other benefits to Dale,\nwill make it easier for him to obtain an\neducation, the school district is responsible for\nthe cost of confinement. That, we conclude, goes\ntoo far.\n\n This is not a case like Kruelle v. New Castle\nCounty School District, 642 F.2d 687 (3d Cir.\n1981), where residential placement was necessary\nfor educational reasons. The case involved a\nthirteen year old who had an IQ below 30 and\ncould not walk, dress, or eat without assistance.\nUnder stress, he would self-induce vomiting and\nchoking; inconsistent approaches or environments\nwould trigger this behavior. For that child, an\neducation meant training in the basic social\nskills of using the toilet, dressing, feeding,\nand simple communication. That education required\nresidential placement, which was therefore a\n\"necessary predicate for learning\" as opposed to\nbeing--a good description of the present case, as\nof Burke County Board of Education v. Denton, 895\nF.2d 973 (4th Cir. 1990)--a \"response to\nmedical, social or emotional problems that are\nsegregable from the learning process.\" 642 F.2d\n\fat 693; cf. Tennessee Dep’t of Mental Health &\nMental Retardation v. Paul B., 88 F.3d 1466 (6th\nCir. 1996); McKenzie v. Smith, 771 F.2d 1527\n(D.C. Cir. 1985). Although Teague Independent\nSchool District v. Todd L., 999 F.3d 127, 132\n(5th Cir. 1993), could be read to leave open the\npossibility that \"twenty-four hour supervision in\na locked unit\" might be a related service, the\ncourt pointedly remarked that the \"focus\" of the\nhighly restrictive facility that Todd’s parents\npreferred \"was on behavior management,\" not\neducation.\n\n No other issues need be discussed. The judgment\nin favor of the plaintiffs, and the award of\nattorneys’ fees to them, are reversed with\ndirections to enter judgment for the defendants.\nThe dismissal of the other counts in the\ncomplaint is affirmed. The motion to dismiss the\nschool district’s appeal on the ground of\nmootness is denied, and the plaintiffs’ cross-\nappeals are denied because they have no merit in\nlight of our decision of the school district’s\nappeal.\n\nAffirmed in Part, Reversed in Part.\n\n\n\n\n RIPPLE, Circuit Judge, dissenting. While chiding\nthe district court (unfairly in my view) for not\nhaving given sufficient deference to the\nsuperficial analysis of the Level II hearing\nexaminer, the majority fails itself to give\nadequate deference of a far more fundamental\ncharacter--deference to the manifest will of the\nCongress that the District must provide support\nservices that are necessary for the meaningful\ndelivery of educational services. By holding\nthat, as a matter of law, the residential program\nat Elan does not come within the ambit of the\nAct, the majority not only dooms Dale M.’s case\nbut also sets this circuit on a course different\nfrom that of all the courts that have interpreted\nthis provision.\n\n Recognizing that the nature of support services\nnecessarily will be varied and, in the case of\nsome children, broad, every circuit that has\naddressed the question has held that the\nCongressional mandate requires the provision of a\nsupport service that is \"a necessary predicate\nfor learning,\" Kruelle v. New Castle County Sch.\nDist., 642 F.2d 687, 693 (3d Cir. 1981), and not\n\"segregable from the learning process,\" id. See\nTennessee Dep’t of Mental Health & Mental\nRetardation v. Paul B., 88 F.3d 1466, 1471 (6th\nCir. 1996) (stating that districts are not\nresponsible for residential placement \"separable\n\ffrom the learning process\" and citing Kruelle);\nBurke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, 895 F.2d\n973, 980 (4th Cir. 1990) (\"Where medical, social\nor emotional problems are intertwined with\neducational problems, courts recognize that the\nlocal education agency must fund residential\nprograms . . . .\") (citing Kruelle); McKenzie v.\nSmith, 771 F.2d 1527, 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1985)\n(quoting Kruelle standard). Today, this circuit\nsubstitutes for that test a very different\nformulation: Costs are to be disallowed if the\nsupport services are not aimed at a problem that\nis \"primarily educational.\" Slip op. at 7. That\nthe difference between the panel majority’s\nformulation and that of our sister circuits is\nnot just one of semantics but a chasm of\nsubstance is made starkly clear by the analysis\nof the Third Circuit in Kruelle. There, it noted\nthat \"basic self-help and social skills such as\ntraining, dressing, feeding and communication\"\ncan be part of the necessary process of\neducation. Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693 (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n Dale M.’s truancy is no doubt complex in its\ncausation and therefore in the degree of its\ninterrelatedness with his capacity to cope with\nthe usual demands of education. We lack the\ninstitutional capacity to conduct an independent\nanalysis of Dale M.’s educational needs. Indeed,\nwe previously have been \"cautioned that courts\nlack the specialized knowledge and experience\nnecessary to resolve persistent and difficult\nquestions of educational policy.\" Board of Educ.\nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Notably,\nhere the District itself considered Dale M.’s\ntruancy to be related to his educational progress\nuntil the need for a residential placement, and\nthe attendant expense, became an issue. It was\nonly at that point that the District took the\nposition that such a program was beyond it\nobligations under the Act.\n\n In determining that the Elan program goes \"too\nfar\" to be within the coverage of the Act, the\nmajority takes issue with the characterization of\nDale M. reached by the professional educators\nand, indeed, by the administrative tribunals and\nthe district court. In the majority’s view, he is\na delinquent deserving of punishment, not\neducation. The majority is entitled to its view;\nin deciding this case, however, it must stay\nwithin the record, a record that includes the\nconclusions of professional educators who viewed\nhis situation in a very different light. For\ninstance, in evaluating the program at Elan, the\nmajority characterizes the program as one that\nsimply provides \"confinement.\" Slip op. at 6.\nYet, the record makes clear that the program at\n\fElan involves three separate components, life\nskills, counseling and class work. Reasonable\npeople can disagree about the effectiveness of\nproviding a structured environment that demands\ncontributing labor to a communal living\nenvironment; however, none of us who wear black\nrobes are in an institutional position to second\nguess the Illinois Department of Education that\napproved the program as a permissible placement\nfor Illinois school children. See Butler v.\nEvans, 225 F.3d 887, 894 (noting that residential\ntreatment at a psychiatric hospital could not be\ncompensable as an educational placement because\nit was not an accredited educational\ninstitution); Seattle Sch. Dist., No. 1 v. A.S.,\n82 F.3d 1493, 1502 (9th Cir. 1996) (rejecting\nschool district’s argument that it should not be\nresponsible for residential placement in part\nbecause residential facility was \"an accredited\neducational institution under state law\"); Clovis\nUnified Sch. Dist. v. California Office of Admin.\nHearings, 903 F.2d 635, 646 (finding that school\ndistrict was not financially responsible for\nplacement because the facility was \"not included\nas [an] educational placement option[ ] for\nhandicapped pupils in that state\").\n\n In sum, I must conclude that the court has\nimprovidently and erroneously parted company with\nthe other circuits that have defined when a\nresidential placement is permissible. In doing\nso, it has set the courts of this circuit on a\ncourse at odds with the course set throughout the\nUnited States for the provision of support\nservices under the Act. It has compounded that\nerror by substituting its own view for that of\nprofessional educators as to the needs of Dale M.\nand the merits of the Elan program. Accordingly,\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f",

She demanded that the school\ndistrict pay for Dale’s attending Elan, as\notherwise he would not be getting the free\nappropriate public education to which he was\nentitled. The school district refused. The Elan\nSchool does not offer psychiatric or other\nmedical treatment for substance abuse or\ndepression. As far as we can determine, it’s just\na boarding school for difficult children. Dale\ndid not like the school, and was excluded from\nmost school activities because of his belligerent\nattitude.\n\n The mother sought reimbursement of the expense\nof Dale’s attending Elan. Her claim was\nadjudicated in succession by two hearing officers\nappointed by the state. The first ordered the\npublic school district to pay but the second, the\nreviewing officer, reversed the order of the\nfirst. He could find no evidence that Elan\nprovided a superior educational experience for\nDale to the therapeutic day school, let alone any\ntreatment for his \"conduct disorder\" or his\ndepression and substance abuse; it merely\nprovided confinement, thus solving the problem of\nhis truancy. The hearing officer did not think\nthat the statute required the school district to\npay for confining a truant student.\n\n The district judge reversed and ordered\nreimbursement. The school district has paid\npursuant to the district court’s order, and the\nplaintiffs argue that this makes the school\ndistrict’s appeal moot, but that is wrong. A\njudgment creditor who pays the judgment pending\nappeal instead of posting a supersedeas bond\n(which would automatically stay collection, see\nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(d)) is entitled to the return\nof its money if the decision is reversed, and so\nthe payment does not moot the appeal unless the\nappellant has relinquished his right to seek\nrepayment if he wins.

The grant of\nthe plaintiffs’ motion thus implied that the\njudge was not considering any evidence not\npresented in the administrative proceedings. The\nevidence that had been submitted for the first\ntime in the district court indicated, for\nexample, that after the decision by the second\nhearing officer Dale graduated from Elan. But the\njudge said that \"Dale is receiving an educational\nbenefit from Elan\" (emphasis added), implying\nthat Dale was still at the school. This is a\nfurther indication that the judge didn’t consider\nany of the new evidence.\n\n The judge recited the correct, the deferential,\nstandard of review for the case where no new\nevidence is considered (still another indication\nthat he did not consider the new evidence), but\nwhen he came to actually discuss the second\nhearing officer’s decision, he applied an\nincorrect standard. He said for example that he\n\"disagrees with the reviewing officer’s\nconclusion that Elan was inappropriate\" and \"a\npreponderance of the evidence shows that Elan is\nan appropriate placement for Dale.\" That is the\nlanguage of de novo determination of contested\nfactual issues. The judge may have been confused\nby the language of the statute: \"In any action\nbrought under this paragraph the court shall\nreceive the records of the administrative\nproceedings, shall hear additional evidence at\nthe request of a party, and, basing its decision\non the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant\nsuch relief as the court determines is\nappropriate.\" 20 U.S.C. sec. 1415(i) (2)(B). When\nthe court has before it evidence that was not\nbefore the hearing officers, the amount of\ndeference due the reviewing officer declines,\nsince the latter’s decision was based on an\nincomplete record. But when there either is no\nnew evidence or the judge for some reason doesn’t\n\fconsider it, he owes considerable deference to\nthe reviewing officer.\n\n When due deference is given that officer, we\nthink it plain that his determination that\nplacement in the Elan school was not the \"free\nappropriate education\" to which the statute\nrefers should not have been disturbed. It is true\nthat Dale has psychological problems that\ninterfered with his obtaining an education, even\nthough he has no learning disability or\nretardation. And the statute refers explicitly to\n\"psychological services\" as one type of \"related\nservices\" that the statute may require a school\ndistrict to pay for if, without them, the\ndisabled child--and we do not understand the\nschool district to be denying that Dale’s\nproblems add up to a disability within the\nmeaning of the statute, 20 U.S.C. sec. 1401(3);\n34 C.F.R. sec. 300.7; Board of Education v.\nNathan R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767121\"><a href=\"/opinion/767121/board-of-education-of-oak-park-river-forest-high-school-district-200-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379 n. 2 (7th Cir.\n2000); compare Rodiriecus L. v.

But the Elan\nSchool does not provide psychological services,\nat least to Dale. For him all it provides is\nconfinement. He was placed in Elan not from any\nschool in the defendant school district, but from\njail. Elan is a jail substitute. An incorrigible\ntruant and lawbreaker, Dale does better in every\nrespect when he is in a custodial setting than\nwhen he lives at home.\n\n The only difference between the therapeutic day\nschool in which the school district put him (and\nwanted to return him to, despite his history of\ntruancy) and Elan is that Elan is a boarding\nschool specializing in anfractuous kids. So at\nleast the second hearing officer determined, and\nthe district court was obliged to defer to that\ndetermination, which was both supported by the\nevidence and within the presumed superior\ncompetence of the administrative process to\nresolve matters of educational policy. Hence Elan\nwas the \"appropriate\" placement for Dale, within\nthe meaning of the statute, only if confinement\nis a related service within that meaning, since\nobviously it is not an educational service. We\nthink--and this is a pure legal issue, as to\nwhich we owe no deference to the hearing officer,\nMorton Community Unit School District No. 709 v.\nJ.M., supra, 152 F.3d at 587--that it stretches\nthe statute too far to classify confinement thus.\n\n The essential distinction is between services\nprimarily oriented toward enabling a disabled\nchild to obtain an education and services\noriented more toward enabling the child to engage\nin noneducational activities. The former are\n\"related services\" within the meaning of the\n\fstatute, the latter not. Butler v. Evans, No. 99-\n3135, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1231053</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4-*6 (7th Cir. Aug 31,\n2000). In our Morton case, for example, the\nmedical-support services rendered the plaintiff\nwere for the purpose of enabling him to attend\nschool. 152 F.3d at 583. In contrast, the purpose\nof the \"service\" that the school district is\nbeing asked to pay for is to keep Dale out of\njail, both directly, because the judge was\nwilling to release him from jail to Elan, and\nindirectly, because Dale is less likely to commit\nburglary and other crimes when he is in a\nresidential facility than when he is living at\nhome with only his mother to keep an eye on him.\n\n Another way to put this is that Dale’s problems\nare not primarily educational. He has the\nintelligence to perform well as a student and no\ncognitive defect or disorder such as dyslexia\nthat prevents him from applying his intelligence\nto the acquisition of an education, without\nspecial assistance. His problem is a lack of\nproper socialization, as a result of which,\ndespite his tender age, he has compiled a\nsignificant criminal record. His substance abuse\ninterferes with his schooling; that is true; but\nit interferes with much else besides, such as\nability to conform to the law and avoid jail.\nSupposing that the most effective educational\nprogram for Dale would be to take correspondence\ncourses while confined in a prison, we do not\nthink his mother would be arguing that the school\ndistrict would have to pay the prison authorities\nfor the expense of incarcerating him. But that is\nclose to what she is arguing--that since\nconfinement, among its other benefits to Dale,\nwill make it easier for him to obtain an\neducation, the school district is responsible for\nthe cost of confinement. That, we conclude, goes\ntoo far.\n\n This is not a case like Kruelle v. New Castle\nCounty School District, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n1981), where residential placement was necessary\nfor educational reasons. The case involved a\nthirteen year old who had an IQ below 30 and\ncould not walk, dress, or eat without assistance.\nUnder stress, he would self-induce vomiting and\nchoking; inconsistent approaches or environments\nwould trigger this behavior. For that child, an\neducation meant training in the basic social\nskills of using the toilet, dressing, feeding,\nand simple communication.

Today, this circuit\nsubstitutes for that test a very different\nformulation: Costs are to be disallowed if the\nsupport services are not aimed at a problem that\nis \"primarily educational.\" Slip op. at 7. That\nthe difference between the panel majority’s\nformulation and that of our sister circuits is\nnot just one of semantics but a chasm of\nsubstance is made starkly clear by the analysis\nof the Third Circuit in Kruelle.

We lack the\ninstitutional capacity to conduct an independent\nanalysis of Dale M.’s educational needs. Indeed,\nwe previously have been \"cautioned that courts\nlack the specialized knowledge and experience\nnecessary to resolve persistent and difficult\nquestions of educational policy.\" Board of Educ.\nv.

Notably,\nhere the District itself considered Dale M.’s\ntruancy to be related to his educational progress\nuntil the need for a residential placement, and\nthe attendant expense, became an issue. It was\nonly at that point that the District took the\nposition that such a program was beyond it\nobligations under the Act.\n\n In determining that the Elan program goes \"too\nfar\" to be within the coverage of the Act, the\nmajority takes issue with the characterization of\nDale M. reached by the professional educators\nand, indeed, by the administrative tribunals and\nthe district court. In the majority’s view, he is\na delinquent deserving of punishment, not\neducation. The majority is entitled to its view;\nin deciding this case, however, it must stay\nwithin the record, a record that includes the\nconclusions of professional educators who viewed\nhis situation in a very different light. For\ninstance, in evaluating the program at Elan, the\nmajority characterizes the program as one that\nsimply provides \"confinement.\" Slip op. at 6.\nYet, the record makes clear that the program at\n\fElan involves three separate components, life\nskills, counseling and class work. Reasonable\npeople can disagree about the effectiveness of\nproviding a structured environment that demands\ncontributing labor to a communal living\nenvironment; however, none of us who wear black\nrobes are in an institutional position to second\nguess the Illinois Department of Education that\napproved the program as a permissible placement\nfor Illinois school children.

In doing\nso, it has set the courts of this circuit on a\ncourse at odds with the course set throughout the\nUnited States for the provision of support\nservices under the Act. It has compounded that\nerror by substituting its own view for that of\nprofessional educators as to the needs of Dale M.\nand the merits of the Elan program. Accordingly,\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
