INTRODUCTION\n             The Alaska Board of Game promulgated regulations managing caribou\nhunting in Game Management Unit 13. The regulations allow hunting under three types\nof permits: a community harvest subsistence permit, an individual subsistence permit,\nor a non-subsistence drawing permit.        A hunter challenged the regulations on\nconstitutional and statutory grounds, arguing that they wrongfully interfered with his\nsubsistence hunting rights, and also sought a judicially imposed public reprimand of an\nassistant attorney general representing the Board. The superior court dismissed the claim\nagainst the attorney, granted summary judgment upholding the regulations, and awarded\npartial attorney’s fees to the State and an intervenor defendant. The hunter appeals. We\naffirm the dismissal and summary judgment orders, but vacate the attorney’s fees awards\nand remand for further proceedings.\nII.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n             This case involves a challenge to the Board of Game’s 2010 amendments\nto regulations for subsistence caribou hunting in Game Management Unit 13, known as\nthe Nelchina basin.1 Under the governing statute, if a game population can be harvested\nconsistent with sustained yield principles, the Board must “determine the amount of the\nharvestable portion that is reasonably necessary for subsistence uses.”2        (This is\n\n\n\n      1\n              We recently discussed the history of caribou hunting regulation in the\nNelchina basin in Alaska Fish & Wildlife Conservation Fund v.

No. 6992 at 2-5, 2015 WL 1393374, at *1-2 (Alaska Mar. 27, 2015)\n(concerning subsistence moose and caribou hunting in Game Management Units 11, 12,\nand 13, collectively referred to therein as the “Copper Basin”) and Ahtna Tene Nené v.\nState, Department of Fish & Game, 288 P.3d 452, 455-57 (Alaska 2012) (concerning\nsubsistence moose and caribou hunting in Game Management Unit 13 only, referred to\ntherein as the “Nelchina basin”).\n      2\n             AS 16.05.258(b).\n\n                                           -2-                                     7008\n\n\fcommonly called the “amount reasonably necessary for subsistence,” or “ANS.”3)\nSubsistence uses are managed at either the Tier I or Tier II level.4 Tier I management is\nappropriate when the Board concludes that the allowable harvest is sufficient to provide\na reasonable opportunity for all subsistence uses; otherwise Tier II management is\nappropriate.5 Subsistence hunting under Tier II is more limited, with permits allocated\nbased on specific eligibility criteria.6\n              In 1993 the Board determined that the ANS for Nelchina caribou was\n“100% of the allowable harvest” because the demand for subsistence hunting\n“exceed[ed] supply.” The Board therefore managed the Nelchina caribou hunt under\nTier II. Following a stream of complaints that the Tier II system did not provide\nsufficient subsistence opportunity for Nelchina caribou, the Board began developing new\nregulations in 2006. The Board made new findings about the customary and traditional\nuses of Nelchina caribou and adopted regulations requiring that hunters conform to\nidentified practices. In March 2009 the Board determined the ANS to be 600-1,000\nanimals, accounting for the demand of only those hunters following the customary and\ntraditional use practices identified in its findings. Based on the revised ANS and that\nyear’s estimated allowable harvest of 1,000 animals, the Board transitioned management\nof the Nelchina caribou hunt from a Tier II to a Tier I system. The regulations created\ntwo types of subsistence hunting permits: a community harvest permit and an individual\n\n\n\n        3\n              See 5 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 99.025(c)(1) (2014).\n        4\n            AS 16.05.258(b); State, Dep’t of Fish & Game v.

After reviewing extensive evidence on population and hunting trends for\nNelchina caribou, the Board again calculated the ANS at 600-1,000 animals. Because\nthe estimated allowable harvest of 2,300 caribou was greater than the ANS, the Board\nconcluded that the Nelchina caribou subsistence hunt must be managed under Tier I.\nThe Board then reinstated the bifurcated community/individual subsistence hunt system,\nwith revisions, and also allowed issuance of non-subsistence hunt drawing permits.9\n             The regulations establish that any group of 25 or more persons may apply\nfor a community harvest subsistence permit entitling each group member to harvest one\ncaribou during the regulatory year.10 The group must follow the customary and\ntraditional use pattern identified by the Board for community subsistence hunts.11\nIndividual subsistence permit holders also are entitled to harvest one caribou per\nhousehold during the regulatory year, but are not subject to the community harvest\n\n\n      7\n            See Ahtna Tene Nené v.

Manning\nsought an injunction preventing the Department from implementing the Nelchina caribou\ncommunity subsistence hunt regulations on various constitutional and statutory grounds,\nand sought a judicially imposed reprimand of Saxby for alleged violations of law while\nhe was representing the Board. Ahtna Tene Nené (Ahtna) was permitted to intervene as\na defendant. Shortly thereafter the superior court dismissed the claim against Saxby,\nconcluding that he was entitled to discretionary and qualified immunity and that the court\ncould not grant the specific relief Manning sought.\n             In late October 2011 the Department issued an emergency order closing the\nNelchina caribou hunt to non-subsistence drawing permit holders. Manning, who held\nan individual subsistence hunt permit, moved for an “emergency expedited ex parte\npreliminary injunction” enjoining the closure, but the superior court denied the motion\nbecause Manning lacked standing. In early December 2011 the Department closed the\n\n\n\n      12\n             5 AAC 85.025(a)(8), 92.071(a).\n      13\n             5 AAC 85.025(a)(8).\n      14\n             Id.; 5 AAC 92.072(d).\n      15\n             5 AAC 92.050(a)(4)(I).\n\n                                           -5-                                      7008\n\n\findividual subsistence hunt, and three days later the Department closed the community\nharvest subsistence hunt.\n             Manning filed a summary judgment motion in June 2012, and the\nDepartment and Ahtna filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In April 2013 the\nsuperior court denied Manning’s motion and granted the Department’s and Ahtna’s\ncross-motions, concluding that the Board’s decision to change the Nelchina caribou hunt\nfrom a Tier II hunt to a Tier I hunt was reasonable and consistent with statute16 and that\nthe new regulations were constitutional and did not violate the public trust doctrine. The\ncourt also rejected Manning’s argument that the Department provided insufficient notice\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act before it closed the individual and community\nharvest subsistence hunts by emergency order.\n             During and following the summary judgment proceedings Manning filed\nseveral motions to disqualify the presiding judge and a motion for new proceedings,\nalleging the judge was biased and incompetent. Each motion was denied.\n             The Department and Ahtna moved for attorney’s fees, and the superior\ncourt awarded them partial fees as prevailing parties under Alaska Civil Rule 82. The\ncourt concluded that 15 of the 30 counts in Manning’s complaint requested constitutional\nrelief and were not frivolous, so Manning could not be liable for attorney’s fees incurred\nin connection with those claims under AS 09.60.010.17 The court awarded attorney’s\n\n      16\n              Specifically the superior court concluded: (1) the decision to change the\nANS for Nelchina caribou was reasonable and supported by sufficient evidence; (2) the\nANS range calculated by the Board in October 2010 was reasonable and supported by\nsufficient evidence; and (3) the Board’s decision to transition from a Tier II to a Tier I\nhunt was supported by sufficient evidence.\n      17\n             AS 09.60.010(c)(2) provides that a court:\n             [M]ay not order a claimant to pay the attorney fees of the\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                           -6-                                      7008\n\n\ffees for all time spent on “non-constitutional, procedural issues,” and for 50% of the time\nspent on work in which the type of claim could not be identified. The court also reduced\nthe hourly rates the Department and Ahtna claimed by half because Manning was\nindigent, resulting in final awards of $4,573 to the Department and $1,080 to Ahtna.\n               Manning appeals.\nIII.\t   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n               “We review grants of motions to dismiss and grants of summary judgment\nde novo . . . .”18\n               “We presume that regulations are valid and we place the burden of proving\notherwise on the challenging party”:19\n               We review an agency’s regulation for whether it is\n               “consistent with and reasonably necessary to implement the\n               statutes authorizing [its] adoption.” Toward this end we\n               consider: (1) whether [the agency] exceeded its statutory\n               authority in promulgating the regulation; (2) whether the\n               regulation is reasonable and not arbitrary; and (3) whether the\n\n\n\n\n        17\t\n               (...continued)\n               opposing party devoted to claims concerning constitutional\n               rights if the claimant . . . did not prevail in asserting the right,\n               the action or appeal asserting the right was not frivolous, and\n               the claimant did not have sufficient economic incentive to\n               bring the action or appeal regardless of the constitutional\n               claims involved.\n        18\n             Smith v.

But the Board’s decision is lawful so long as\n5 AAC 85.025(a)(8) is consistent with the statute and is reasonable and not arbitrary.27\nAlaska Statute 16.05.258(b) requires the Board to adopt regulations managing a game\npopulation under Tier II only “if the harvestable portion of the . . . population is not\nsufficient to provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses.”28 We construe\nManning’s argument to be that 5 AAC 85.025(a)(8) is inconsistent with its authorizing\nstatute — AS 16.05.258(b) — because it impermissibly allows the Board to manage the\nsubsistence hunt under Tier I when the allowable harvest of Nelchina caribou is\ninsufficient to provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses.

It is\nundisputed that the Board has statutory authority to promulgate regulations managing\nsubsistence game hunts. See AS 16.05.258. The fact that the Board previously\ndetermined the Nelchina caribou hunt had to be managed under Tier II does not affect\nthe standard of review or analysis.

The meaning of “reasonable opportunity for\nsubsistence uses” involves the Board’s expertise and is committed to the Board’s\ndiscretion by statute,29 so the Board’s determination that a reasonable opportunity exists\nis consistent with statute if the determination has a reasonable basis.30\n              Manning argues the Board cannot conclude that a reasonable opportunity\nfor subsistence uses exists because the Board relied on an ANS value it had “unlawfully\nreduce[d].” And because the Board must manage a hunt at the Tier II level if the\nharvestable surplus is below the ANS,31 the Board could not reasonably conclude that\na reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses existed if it relied on an improper ANS\nvalue.\n              Manning argues the ANS determination is unlawful in two ways: (1) the\nBoard violated the Alaska Constitution by relying on impermissible user characteristics\nin its ANS calculation; and (2) the ANS determination is unreasonable. Although the\nANS determination was published as a regulation — 5 AAC 99.025(a)(4) — the\n\n\n\n         29\n              See AS 16.05.258(f) (“For purposes of this section, ‘reasonable\nopportunity’ means an opportunity, as determined by the appropriate board, that allows\na subsistence user to participate in a subsistence hunt or fishery that provides a normally\ndiligent participant with a reasonable expectation of success of taking of fish or game.”\n(emphasis added)).\n         30\n            See Davis Wright Tremaine LLP v.

(Emphasis in original.)      But\nAS 16.05.258(b) refers to ANS in terms of subsistence uses, not users.34 The record\nreveals that the Board included a broad variety of subsistence uses in its ANS\ncalculation. And even if the Board had defined subsistence uses of Nelchina caribou to\ninclude only local community hunting practices, it would not necessarily have violated\nthe Alaska Constitution — considering certain users’ patterns to define the subsistence\nuses placing demand on a game population affects only that game population’s\nclassification; it “does not affect any individual’s ability to obtain a subsistence permit\n\n\n\n       32\n               See AFWCF I, 289 P.3d at 907 (citing Koyukuk River Basin Moose Co-\nMgmt.

Accordingly, the Board’s ANS calculation\ndoes not implicate, nor violate, the equal access, uniform application, or equal protection\nclauses of the Alaska Constitution.36\n              2.      The Board’s ANS calculation is reasonable.\n              Manning also asserts that the ANS calculation was improperly reduced for\nthe purpose of converting the hunt to Tier I and implementing a community subsistence\nhunt. But Manning points to nothing in the record indicating the Board “manipulate[d]”\nthe ANS “simply to achieve a predetermined outcome.”37 On the contrary, considerable\nevidence in the record justifies the Board’s ANS calculation and demonstrates that the\nBoard took “a hard look at the salient problems and . . . genuinely engaged in reasoned\ndecision making.”38\n              The Board reviewed extensive evidence on long-term harvest, customary\nand traditional use patterns, and caribou population trends, and it considered a number\nof proposals for defining subsistence uses of Nelchina caribou in making its ANS\ndetermination.     It concluded the 600-1,000 ANS best fit the available data after\nconsidering at least eight possible ANS options. The Board identified substantial\nevidentiary support justifying the customary and traditional use definition applied in its\nANS determination. And the Board continued to consider a number of proposed\n\n\n\n       35\n              AFWCF I, 289 P.3d at 910.\n       36\n              See id.\n       37\n              Native Vill. of Elim, 990 P.2d at 11.\n       38\n             Interior Alaska Airboat Ass’n v.

The Board\nconcluded that “Tier II is off [the] table” only after comparing the adopted ANS to the\nharvestable surplus.\n             Although there is some evidence that the Board preferred that the ANS\ndetermination ultimately allow for a Tier I hunt, it does not appear that the ANS was\nimproperly manipulated to achieve a predetermined outcome. The record provides\nsufficient evidentiary support demonstrating that the Board’s ANS calculation is both\nprocedurally and substantively reasonable. Accordingly the Board reasonably concluded\nthat there is a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses. Managing the Nelchina\ncaribou hunt under Tier I through 5 AAC 85.025(a)(8) is consistent with the statute and\nis reasonable and not arbitrary.\n      B.\t    The 2011 Closures By Emergency Order Did Not Violate The\n             Administrative Procedure Act’s Notice Requirements.\n             Manning contends that the Department violated the Administrative\nProcedure Act by failing to give permit applicants sufficient notice that the individual\nsubsistence and the non-subsistence drawing hunts “may be closed by Emergency Order\nprior to achieving the annual harvest quota, while allowing or granting a priority\npreference for ‘community’ permit hunters (CHP) to continue to hunt the same resource\nprior to the annual harvest quota.” (Emphasis in original.) Manning appears to be\nreferring to the emergency closures of the Nelchina caribou hunt in 2011.39\n\n\n      39\n              Although Manning refers to the individual subsistence and non-subsistence\ndrawing hunt closures in his brief, Manning’s Administrative Procedure Act challenge\nin the superior court involved only the individual and community harvest subsistence\nhunt closures; the court previously had denied Manning standing to challenge the\ndrawing hunt closure. Accordingly we consider Manning’s Administrative Procedure\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                         -13-\t                                    7008\n\n\fAlaska Statute 16.05.060 authorizes closures by emergency orders, which have the force\nof law.40 Emergency orders are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, so no\nnotice is required prior to their issuance.41 Manning’s concern about the three-day\ndifference in the emergency closures of the individual subsistence hunt and the\ncommunity subsistence hunt has little to do with notice; to the extent his concern is about\nequal protection, his argument is undeveloped and we do not consider it.\n       C.     The Claim Against Saxby Was Properly Dismissed.\n              The superior court dismissed Manning’s claim against Saxby on the\nalternative grounds of discretionary function immunity, official immunity, and the\ncourt’s lack of authority to grant the relief requested. Manning provides no authority\nestablishing that the superior court has general jurisdiction to issue a public reprimand\nfor attorney misconduct extrinsic to court proceedings.42 Nor does Manning cite any\nauthority that the superior court has general jurisdiction to issue a reprimand against a\npublic official for conduct extrinsic to court proceedings. Insofar as Manning may have\nbeen requesting declaratory relief against Saxby, such relief is not available in this case:\n\n\n\n\n       39\n             (...continued)\nAct challenge on appeal to relate only to the individual and community harvest\nsubsistence hunt emergency closures.\n       40\n              We note that Manning’s 2011 individual subsistence hunt permit expressly\nstates: “This caribou hunt may be closed by Emergency Order (EO). It is your\nresponsibility to be aware of hunt closures.”\n       41\n              AS 16.05.060(c), 44.62.190.\n       42\n              The proper forum for seeking attorney discipline for such misconduct is the\nAlaska Bar Association. See Alaska Bar R. 10(c). A superior court may, of course,\nsanction an attorney for misconduct occurring in the course of court proceedings. See,\ne.g., Alaska R. Civ. P. 16(f), 77(j); see also Alaska Bar R. 9(c).\n\n                                           -14-                                       7008\n\n\fsimply asking that a public official be reprimanded does not present a justiciable\ncontroversy.43\n       D.     Manning’s Other Issues Lack Merit.\n              Manning argues that conditioning Tier I eligibility on “community criteria”\nviolates article I, section 1 and article VIII, sections 3, 15, and 17 of the Alaska\nConstitution, and that these arguments must be reviewed under strict scrutiny.44 We\nconstrue these arguments to allege that the community harvest permit eligibility criteria\nare unconstitutional. But we upheld the constitutionality of these criteria in AFWCF II.45\n              Manning also argues that the superior court erred by denying him standing\nto challenge the 2011 drawing hunt emergency closure order. The issue is now moot,\n\n\n\n\n       43\n              See State v. Am. Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, 204 P.3d 364, 368 (Alaska\n2009) (noting that under Alaska’s declaratory judgment statute, AS 22.10.020(g),\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate only when an “actual controversy” exists); see also\nThuma v. Kroschel, 506 N.W.2d 14, 21 (Minn. App. 1993) (holding allegation that city\nmayor acted “ultra vires,” without more, could not support an action for declaratory\njudgment because there was no genuine, adversarial conflict); Port Isabel/S.

Specifically he\ncontends that: the regulations violate the sustainable yield requirement of article VIII,\nsection 4 of the Alaska Constitution; the prohibition on Unit 13 permit holders hunting\ncaribou or moose elsewhere in the state is unconstitutional; the restrictions on a killed\ncaribou’s use are unlawful; the regulations “unlawfully grant and provide a special\npreference priority granting new aboriginal rights in violation [of the] Alaska Native\nClaims Settlement Act”; and the denials of his motions regarding the presiding judge’s\nalleged bias were erroneous. But because his arguments on these points are conclusory\nand inadequately developed, we consider them waived.47\n       E.\t      The Attorney’s Fees Awards Were Calculated Improperly And Must\n                Be Vacated.\n                The superior court awarded the Department and Ahtna attorney’s fees under\nAlaska Civil Rule 82 for defending 15 of the 30 counts in the complaint, reasoning that\nManning was immune under AS 09.60.010(c)(2) from paying fees related to the 15\ncounts the court believed concerned constitutional claims. Manning argues that the court\nerred because each of the 30 counts concerns a constitutional right.\n                The superior court did not indicate which counts of Manning’s complaint\nconcerned constitutional rights. But based on our de novo review, we conclude that 19\n\n\n\n\n       46\n             See Ahtna Tene Nené v. State, Dep’t of Fish & Game, 288 P.3d 452, 457\n(Alaska 2012) (“A claim is moot if it ‘has lost its character as a present, live\ncontroversy.’ ” (quoting Kleven v. Yukon-Koyukuk Sch. Dist., 853 P.2d 518, 523 (Alaska\n1993))).\n       47\n                See Adamson v. Univ. of Alaska, 819 P.2d 886, 889 n.3 (Alaska 1991).\n\n                                           -16-\t                                    7008\n\n\fof the 30 counts concerned protection of constitutional rights.48 Fifteen counts clearly\nconcerned protection of constitutional rights to subsistence hunting access, sustainable\nyield management, and equal protection.49 Other counts present closer questions. Three\ncounts involved claims that the Board failed to consider relevant statutory factors and\nthat its administrative process was flawed, leading to its promulgation of the allegedly\nunconstitutional community harvest system and the alleged “elimination” of individual\nsubsistence rights. Although these claims can be construed to assert a statutory right to\na lawful administrative process, they are more correctly viewed as seeking to protect the\nconstitutional common use right from improper infringement by agency action.\nLikewise, Manning alleged in one count that under AS 16.05.258(b) — requiring that\ngame management provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses — the\nregulations exceeded the Board’s statutory authority. Although this facially is a statutory\nargument, AS 16.05.258(b) functions to protect Alaskans’ constitutional rights to\nsubsistence hunting access — even absent this statute, Manning would have a\nconstitutional basis for his claim against the Board for failing to protect subsistence\nhunting access.50    But it is not evident that the remaining 11 counts concerned\nconstitutional rights, so Rule 82 attorney’s fees might be awarded for those claims.\n\n\n\n       48\n             Specifically, counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26, 27,\n28, and 29 concerned constitutional rights.\n       49\n              See Alaska Const. art.

Rule 82 attorney’s fees are allowable only\nfor the former. Work on general procedural issues, such as the motions to disqualify the\npresiding judge, cannot be disconnected from Manning’s constitutional claims. Unless\nthe Department or Ahtna can provide sufficiently detailed documentation segregating the\ntime spent on specific procedural work by claim type, the court must assume that the\n\n\n\n       51\n              Id. (emphasis added).\n       52\n               Id. at 228 (citing Fox v. Vice, 131 S. Ct. 2205, 2215 (2011)). Fox v. Vice\ninvolved the federal rule that a plaintiff cannot be liable for attorney’s fees under\n42 U.S.C. § 1988 unless the “ ‘action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without\nfoundation.’ ” 131 S. Ct. at 2213 (quoting Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434\nU.S. 412, 421 (1978)). That rule and AS 09.60.010(c)(2) are analogous in that both\nserve to protect plaintiffs seeking to protect important rights from paying attorney’s fees\nif they do not prevail, unless the defendant incurred the fees defending against a claim\nthat did not concern protection of an important right — e.g., a frivolous or non-\nconstitutional claim. Compare id. (stating § 1988 intended to remove cost barrier of\nvindicating one’s civil rights), with Debate on C.S.H.B. 145 (FIN) Before the Senate,\n23d Leg., 1st Sess. (May 20, 2003) (statements of Sen. Seekins) (“What [AS 09.60.010]\nreally does is it retains the essence of the public interest litigant doctrine for the cases that\nrelate to our most important rights, the constitutional rights. And actually it enlarges\nthose protections.”).\n\n                                              -18-                                         7008\n\n\fbilled time for procedural work was all connected to Manning’s constitutional claims.\nThis assumption protects against the possibility of improperly awarding fees for work\nresponding to constitutional claims. On remand, the superior court should not award\nattorney’s fees for work on a procedural issue unless the applicant provides the requisite\ndocumentation that the procedural issue is related solely to a non-constitutional claim.\n              Based on its conclusion that 15 of Manning’s 30 counts involved\nconstitutional claims, the superior court also awarded the Department and Ahtna\nattorney’s fees for 50% of work for which the nature of the claim involved was not\nidentified. Such a pro rata approach is improper. Although we do not hold that a\nsuperior court can never award partial fees for work when the type of claim cannot be\nclearly identified, the court must ensure that fees are not awarded for work involving\nconstitutional claims.53 Simply awarding a pro rata share of attorney’s fees based on the\nratio of non-constitutional to constitutional claims “would be to risk requiring a plaintiff\nto pay defendants’ attorney[’]s fees incurred in defeating his [constitutional] claims.”54\n\n\n       53\n              As the United States Supreme Court explained in Fox:\n              The essential goal in shifting fees [under 42 U.S.C. § 1988]\n              is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So\n              trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a suit,\n              and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an\n              attorney’s time. . . .\n                       But the trial court must apply the correct standard . . . .\n              That means the trial court must determine whether the fees\n              requested would not have accrued but for the frivolous claim.\n              . . .

INTRODUCTION\n             The Alaska Board of Game promulgated regulations managing caribou\nhunting in Game Management Unit 13. The regulations allow hunting under three types\nof permits: a community harvest subsistence permit, an individual subsistence permit,\nor a non-subsistence drawing permit.        A hunter challenged the regulations on\nconstitutional and statutory grounds, arguing that they wrongfully interfered with his\nsubsistence hunting rights, and also sought a judicially imposed public reprimand of an\nassistant attorney general representing the Board. The superior court dismissed the claim\nagainst the attorney, granted summary judgment upholding the regulations, and awarded\npartial attorney’s fees to the State and an intervenor defendant. The hunter appeals. We\naffirm the dismissal and summary judgment orders, but vacate the attorney’s fees awards\nand remand for further proceedings.\nII.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n             This case involves a challenge to the Board of Game’s 2010 amendments\nto regulations for subsistence caribou hunting in Game Management Unit 13, known as\nthe Nelchina basin.1 Under the governing statute, if a game population can be harvested\nconsistent with sustained yield principles, the Board must “determine the amount of the\nharvestable portion that is reasonably necessary for subsistence uses.”2        (This is\n\n\n\n      1\n              We recently discussed the history of caribou hunting regulation in the\nNelchina basin in Alaska Fish & Wildlife Conservation Fund v.

Following a stream of complaints that the Tier II system did not provide\nsufficient subsistence opportunity for Nelchina caribou, the Board began developing new\nregulations in 2006. The Board made new findings about the customary and traditional\nuses of Nelchina caribou and adopted regulations requiring that hunters conform to\nidentified practices. In March 2009 the Board determined the ANS to be 600-1,000\nanimals, accounting for the demand of only those hunters following the customary and\ntraditional use practices identified in its findings. Based on the revised ANS and that\nyear’s estimated allowable harvest of 1,000 animals, the Board transitioned management\nof the Nelchina caribou hunt from a Tier II to a Tier I system. The regulations created\ntwo types of subsistence hunting permits: a community harvest permit and an individual\n\n\n\n        3\n              See 5 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 99.025(c)(1) (2014).\n        4\n            AS 16.05.258(b); State, Dep’t of Fish & Game v.

After reviewing extensive evidence on population and hunting trends for\nNelchina caribou, the Board again calculated the ANS at 600-1,000 animals. Because\nthe estimated allowable harvest of 2,300 caribou was greater than the ANS, the Board\nconcluded that the Nelchina caribou subsistence hunt must be managed under Tier I.\nThe Board then reinstated the bifurcated community/individual subsistence hunt system,\nwith revisions, and also allowed issuance of non-subsistence hunt drawing permits.9\n             The regulations establish that any group of 25 or more persons may apply\nfor a community harvest subsistence permit entitling each group member to harvest one\ncaribou during the regulatory year.10 The group must follow the customary and\ntraditional use pattern identified by the Board for community subsistence hunts.11\nIndividual subsistence permit holders also are entitled to harvest one caribou per\nhousehold during the regulatory year, but are not subject to the community harvest\n\n\n      7\n            See Ahtna Tene Nené v.

Manning\nsought an injunction preventing the Department from implementing the Nelchina caribou\ncommunity subsistence hunt regulations on various constitutional and statutory grounds,\nand sought a judicially imposed reprimand of Saxby for alleged violations of law while\nhe was representing the Board. Ahtna Tene Nené (Ahtna) was permitted to intervene as\na defendant. Shortly thereafter the superior court dismissed the claim against Saxby,\nconcluding that he was entitled to discretionary and qualified immunity and that the court\ncould not grant the specific relief Manning sought.\n             In late October 2011 the Department issued an emergency order closing the\nNelchina caribou hunt to non-subsistence drawing permit holders. Manning, who held\nan individual subsistence hunt permit, moved for an “emergency expedited ex parte\npreliminary injunction” enjoining the closure, but the superior court denied the motion\nbecause Manning lacked standing. In early December 2011 the Department closed the\n\n\n\n      12\n             5 AAC 85.025(a)(8), 92.071(a).\n      13\n             5 AAC 85.025(a)(8).\n      14\n             Id.; 5 AAC 92.072(d).\n      15\n             5 AAC 92.050(a)(4)(I).\n\n                                           -5-                                      7008\n\n\findividual subsistence hunt, and three days later the Department closed the community\nharvest subsistence hunt.\n             Manning filed a summary judgment motion in June 2012, and the\nDepartment and Ahtna filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In April 2013 the\nsuperior court denied Manning’s motion and granted the Department’s and Ahtna’s\ncross-motions, concluding that the Board’s decision to change the Nelchina caribou hunt\nfrom a Tier II hunt to a Tier I hunt was reasonable and consistent with statute16 and that\nthe new regulations were constitutional and did not violate the public trust doctrine. The\ncourt also rejected Manning’s argument that the Department provided insufficient notice\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act before it closed the individual and community\nharvest subsistence hunts by emergency order.\n             During and following the summary judgment proceedings Manning filed\nseveral motions to disqualify the presiding judge and a motion for new proceedings,\nalleging the judge was biased and incompetent. Each motion was denied.\n             The Department and Ahtna moved for attorney’s fees, and the superior\ncourt awarded them partial fees as prevailing parties under Alaska Civil Rule 82. The\ncourt concluded that 15 of the 30 counts in Manning’s complaint requested constitutional\nrelief and were not frivolous, so Manning could not be liable for attorney’s fees incurred\nin connection with those claims under AS 09.60.010.17 The court awarded attorney’s\n\n      16\n              Specifically the superior court concluded: (1) the decision to change the\nANS for Nelchina caribou was reasonable and supported by sufficient evidence; (2) the\nANS range calculated by the Board in October 2010 was reasonable and supported by\nsufficient evidence; and (3) the Board’s decision to transition from a Tier II to a Tier I\nhunt was supported by sufficient evidence.\n      17\n             AS 09.60.010(c)(2) provides that a court:\n             [M]ay not order a claimant to pay the attorney fees of the\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                           -6-                                      7008\n\n\ffees for all time spent on “non-constitutional, procedural issues,” and for 50% of the time\nspent on work in which the type of claim could not be identified. The court also reduced\nthe hourly rates the Department and Ahtna claimed by half because Manning was\nindigent, resulting in final awards of $4,573 to the Department and $1,080 to Ahtna.\n               Manning appeals.\nIII.\t   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n               “We review grants of motions to dismiss and grants of summary judgment\nde novo . . . .”18\n               “We presume that regulations are valid and we place the burden of proving\notherwise on the challenging party”:19\n               We review an agency’s regulation for whether it is\n               “consistent with and reasonably necessary to implement the\n               statutes authorizing [its] adoption.” Toward this end we\n               consider: (1) whether [the agency] exceeded its statutory\n               authority in promulgating the regulation; (2) whether the\n               regulation is reasonable and not arbitrary; and (3) whether the\n\n\n\n\n        17\t\n               (...continued)\n               opposing party devoted to claims concerning constitutional\n               rights if the claimant . . . did not prevail in asserting the right,\n               the action or appeal asserting the right was not frivolous, and\n               the claimant did not have sufficient economic incentive to\n               bring the action or appeal regardless of the constitutional\n               claims involved.\n        18\n             Smith v.

But the Board’s decision is lawful so long as\n5 AAC 85.025(a)(8) is consistent with the statute and is reasonable and not arbitrary.27\nAlaska Statute 16.05.258(b) requires the Board to adopt regulations managing a game\npopulation under Tier II only “if the harvestable portion of the . . . population is not\nsufficient to provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses.”28 We construe\nManning’s argument to be that 5 AAC 85.025(a)(8) is inconsistent with its authorizing\nstatute — AS 16.05.258(b) — because it impermissibly allows the Board to manage the\nsubsistence hunt under Tier I when the allowable harvest of Nelchina caribou is\ninsufficient to provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses.

It is\nundisputed that the Board has statutory authority to promulgate regulations managing\nsubsistence game hunts. See AS 16.05.258.

The meaning of “reasonable opportunity for\nsubsistence uses” involves the Board’s expertise and is committed to the Board’s\ndiscretion by statute,29 so the Board’s determination that a reasonable opportunity exists\nis consistent with statute if the determination has a reasonable basis.30\n              Manning argues the Board cannot conclude that a reasonable opportunity\nfor subsistence uses exists because the Board relied on an ANS value it had “unlawfully\nreduce[d].” And because the Board must manage a hunt at the Tier II level if the\nharvestable surplus is below the ANS,31 the Board could not reasonably conclude that\na reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses existed if it relied on an improper ANS\nvalue.\n              Manning argues the ANS determination is unlawful in two ways: (1) the\nBoard violated the Alaska Constitution by relying on impermissible user characteristics\nin its ANS calculation; and (2) the ANS determination is unreasonable.

But\nAS 16.05.258(b) refers to ANS in terms of subsistence uses, not users.34 The record\nreveals that the Board included a broad variety of subsistence uses in its ANS\ncalculation.

The Board\nconcluded that “Tier II is off [the] table” only after comparing the adopted ANS to the\nharvestable surplus.\n             Although there is some evidence that the Board preferred that the ANS\ndetermination ultimately allow for a Tier I hunt, it does not appear that the ANS was\nimproperly manipulated to achieve a predetermined outcome. The record provides\nsufficient evidentiary support demonstrating that the Board’s ANS calculation is both\nprocedurally and substantively reasonable. Accordingly the Board reasonably concluded\nthat there is a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses. Managing the Nelchina\ncaribou hunt under Tier I through 5 AAC 85.025(a)(8) is consistent with the statute and\nis reasonable and not arbitrary.\n      B.\t    The 2011 Closures By Emergency Order Did Not Violate The\n             Administrative Procedure Act’s Notice Requirements.\n             Manning contends that the Department violated the Administrative\nProcedure Act by failing to give permit applicants sufficient notice that the individual\nsubsistence and the non-subsistence drawing hunts “may be closed by Emergency Order\nprior to achieving the annual harvest quota, while allowing or granting a priority\npreference for ‘community’ permit hunters (CHP) to continue to hunt the same resource\nprior to the annual harvest quota.” (Emphasis in original.) Manning appears to be\nreferring to the emergency closures of the Nelchina caribou hunt in 2011.39\n\n\n      39\n              Although Manning refers to the individual subsistence and non-subsistence\ndrawing hunt closures in his brief, Manning’s Administrative Procedure Act challenge\nin the superior court involved only the individual and community harvest subsistence\nhunt closures; the court previously had denied Manning standing to challenge the\ndrawing hunt closure. Accordingly we consider Manning’s Administrative Procedure\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                         -13-\t                                    7008\n\n\fAlaska Statute 16.05.060 authorizes closures by emergency orders, which have the force\nof law.40 Emergency orders are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, so no\nnotice is required prior to their issuance.41 Manning’s concern about the three-day\ndifference in the emergency closures of the individual subsistence hunt and the\ncommunity subsistence hunt has little to do with notice; to the extent his concern is about\nequal protection, his argument is undeveloped and we do not consider it.\n       C.     The Claim Against Saxby Was Properly Dismissed.\n              The superior court dismissed Manning’s claim against Saxby on the\nalternative grounds of discretionary function immunity, official immunity, and the\ncourt’s lack of authority to grant the relief requested. Manning provides no authority\nestablishing that the superior court has general jurisdiction to issue a public reprimand\nfor attorney misconduct extrinsic to court proceedings.42 Nor does Manning cite any\nauthority that the superior court has general jurisdiction to issue a reprimand against a\npublic official for conduct extrinsic to court proceedings. Insofar as Manning may have\nbeen requesting declaratory relief against Saxby, such relief is not available in this case:\n\n\n\n\n       39\n             (...continued)\nAct challenge on appeal to relate only to the individual and community harvest\nsubsistence hunt emergency closures.\n       40\n              We note that Manning’s 2011 individual subsistence hunt permit expressly\nstates: “This caribou hunt may be closed by Emergency Order (EO). It is your\nresponsibility to be aware of hunt closures.”\n       41\n              AS 16.05.060(c), 44.62.190.\n       42\n              The proper forum for seeking attorney discipline for such misconduct is the\nAlaska Bar Association. See Alaska Bar R. 10(c). A superior court may, of course,\nsanction an attorney for misconduct occurring in the course of court proceedings. See,\ne.g., Alaska R. Civ. P. 16(f), 77(j); see also Alaska Bar R. 9(c).\n\n                                           -14-                                       7008\n\n\fsimply asking that a public official be reprimanded does not present a justiciable\ncontroversy.43\n       D.     Manning’s Other Issues Lack Merit.\n              Manning argues that conditioning Tier I eligibility on “community criteria”\nviolates article I, section 1 and article VIII, sections 3, 15, and 17 of the Alaska\nConstitution, and that these arguments must be reviewed under strict scrutiny.44 We\nconstrue these arguments to allege that the community harvest permit eligibility criteria\nare unconstitutional. But we upheld the constitutionality of these criteria in AFWCF II.45\n              Manning also argues that the superior court erred by denying him standing\nto challenge the 2011 drawing hunt emergency closure order.

But because his arguments on these points are conclusory\nand inadequately developed, we consider them waived.47\n       E.\t      The Attorney’s Fees Awards Were Calculated Improperly And Must\n                Be Vacated.\n                The superior court awarded the Department and Ahtna attorney’s fees under\nAlaska Civil Rule 82 for defending 15 of the 30 counts in the complaint, reasoning that\nManning was immune under AS 09.60.010(c)(2) from paying fees related to the 15\ncounts the court believed concerned constitutional claims.

Three\ncounts involved claims that the Board failed to consider relevant statutory factors and\nthat its administrative process was flawed, leading to its promulgation of the allegedly\nunconstitutional community harvest system and the alleged “elimination” of individual\nsubsistence rights. Although these claims can be construed to assert a statutory right to\na lawful administrative process, they are more correctly viewed as seeking to protect the\nconstitutional common use right from improper infringement by agency action.\nLikewise, Manning alleged in one count that under AS 16.05.258(b) — requiring that\ngame management provide a reasonable opportunity for subsistence uses — the\nregulations exceeded the Board’s statutory authority. Although this facially is a statutory\nargument, AS 16.05.258(b) functions to protect Alaskans’ constitutional rights to\nsubsistence hunting access — even absent this statute, Manning would have a\nconstitutional basis for his claim against the Board for failing to protect subsistence\nhunting access.50    But it is not evident that the remaining 11 counts concerned\nconstitutional rights, so Rule 82 attorney’s fees might be awarded for those claims.\n\n\n\n       48\n             Specifically, counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26, 27,\n28, and 29 concerned constitutional rights.\n       49\n              See Alaska Const. art.

Rule 82 attorney’s fees are allowable only\nfor the former. Work on general procedural issues, such as the motions to disqualify the\npresiding judge, cannot be disconnected from Manning’s constitutional claims. Unless\nthe Department or Ahtna can provide sufficiently detailed documentation segregating the\ntime spent on specific procedural work by claim type, the court must assume that the\n\n\n\n       51\n              Id.

Vice\ninvolved the federal rule that a plaintiff cannot be liable for attorney’s fees under\n42 U.S.C. § 1988 unless the “ ‘action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without\nfoundation.’ ” 131 S. Ct. at 2213 (quoting Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109769\"><a href=\"/opinion/109769/christiansburg-garment-co-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 (1978)). That rule and AS 09.60.010(c)(2) are analogous in that both\nserve to protect plaintiffs seeking to protect important rights from paying attorney’s fees\nif they do not prevail, unless the defendant incurred the fees defending against a claim\nthat did not concern protection of an important right — e.g., a frivolous or non-\nconstitutional claim. Compare id. (stating § 1988 intended to remove cost barrier of\nvindicating one’s civil rights), with Debate on C.S.H.B. 145 (FIN) Before the Senate,\n23d Leg., 1st Sess. (May 20, 2003) (statements of Sen. Seekins) (“What [AS 09.60.010]\nreally does is it retains the essence of the public interest litigant doctrine for the cases that\nrelate to our most important rights, the constitutional rights. And actually it enlarges\nthose protections.”).\n\n                                              -18-                                         7008\n\n\fbilled time for procedural work was all connected to Manning’s constitutional claims.\nThis assumption protects against the possibility of improperly awarding fees for work\nresponding to constitutional claims. On remand, the superior court should not award\nattorney’s fees for work on a procedural issue unless the applicant provides the requisite\ndocumentation that the procedural issue is related solely to a non-constitutional claim.\n              Based on its conclusion that 15 of Manning’s 30 counts involved\nconstitutional claims, the superior court also awarded the Department and Ahtna\nattorney’s fees for 50% of work for which the nature of the claim involved was not\nidentified. Such a pro rata approach is improper. Although we do not hold that a\nsuperior court can never award partial fees for work when the type of claim cannot be\nclearly identified, the court must ensure that fees are not awarded for work involving\nconstitutional claims.53 Simply awarding a pro rata share of attorney’s fees based on the\nratio of non-constitutional to constitutional claims “would be to risk requiring a plaintiff\nto pay defendants’ attorney[’]s fees incurred in defeating his [constitutional] claims.”54\n\n\n       53\n              As the United States Supreme Court explained in Fox:\n              The essential goal in shifting fees [under 42 U.S.C. § 1988]\n              is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So\n              trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a suit,\n              and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an\n              attorney’s time. . . .\n                       But the trial court must apply the correct standard . . . .\n              That means the trial court must determine whether the fees\n              requested would not have accrued but for the frivolous claim.\n              . . . A trial court has wide discretion when, but only when, it\n              calls the game by the right rules.\n131 S. Ct. at 2216-17 (citations omitted).\n       54\n              Harris v.
