City ofShoreline, 170 Wn.2d 138, 150, 240 P.3d 1149 (2010). Today we\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nconsider if the PRA similarly applies when a public employee uses a private cell\n\nphone to conduct government business.                  We hold that text messages sent and\n\nreceived by a public employee in the employee's official capacity are public records\n\nof the employer, even if the employee uses a private cell phone.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n      This case involves two requests for public records that Glenda Nissen, a\n\nsheriffs detective, sent to Pierce County (County). Both requests asked for records\n\nrelated to Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist. One request stated:\n\n      Please produce any and all of Mark Lindquist's cellular telephone\n      records for number 253-861-[XXXX 1] or any other cellular telephone\n      he uses to conduct his business including text messages from August 2,\n      2011.\n\nClerk's Papers (CP) at 15. The other stated:\n\n      The new public records request is for Mark Lindquist's cellular\n      telephone records for number 253-861-[XXXX] for June 7, [2010]J2]\n\nId. at 17 (second alteration in original). The telephone number identified in these\n\nrequests is connected to Lindquist's private cell phone. There is no dispute that\n\nLindquist personally bought the phone, pays for its monthly service, and sometimes\n\nuses it in the course of his job.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           Though redacted in the record before us, the requests contained the full 10-digit telephone\nnumber.\n       2 The County has not challenged the breadth or specificity of these requests, and we pass\nno opinion.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      In response to these requests, Lindquist obtained and provided the County\n\nwith two types of records. The first, which the parties refer to as the \"call log,\" is\n\nsimilar to an itemized statement customers might receive from their service provider\n\neach month. It contains information about the dates and times of calls made and\n\nreceived, the length of those calls, and the telephone number of the incoming or\n\noutgoing call. Lindquist's service provider, Verizon Wireless, generated the call log\n\nand provided it to Lindquist at his request. He voluntarily produced it to the County.\n\n      The second type of record reveals information about text messages Lindquist\n\nsent and received over two days (\"text message log\"). The text message log does\n\nnot reveal the content of those messages. Instead, similar to the call log, it itemizes\n\nthe date and time of each message and provides the telephone number of the\n\ncorresponding party. Lindquist also obtained the text message log from Verizon\n\nafter receiving Nissen's PRA requests and produced it to the County.\n\n       The County reviewed the call and text message logs and disclosed partially\n\nredacted copies to Nissen.     Accompanied by an exemption log, the redactions\n\nconceal line items for calls and text messages that Lindquist self-described as\n\npersonal in nature.    The remaining unredacted portions relate to calls and text\n\nmessages that the County and Lindquist admit might be work related. See CP at 490\n\n(Decl. of Mark Lindquist in Supp. of Mot. To Intervene & Join) (\"I authorized the\n\nrelease of records of calls that were related to the conduct of government or the\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nperformance of any governmental or proprietary function.\"); Pierce County's Pet.\n\nfor Review at 3 (\"[T]he Prosecutor authorized the release of records of calls that\n\n'may be work related.\"'); Lindquist's Pet. for Review at 10 (\"[T]he Petitioner\n\nprovided those communications that may be 'work related.\"'). Thus nearly half of\n\nthe text messages Lindquist sent or received and many of his phone calls during the\n\nrelevant period potentially related to his job as the elected prosecutor. The County\n\ndid not produce the contents of any text message, however, though copies of them\n\nexist on V erizon' s servers. 3\n\n       Dissatisfied with the County's disclosures, Nissen sued the County in\n\nThurston County Superior Court. She sought an in camera review of Lindquist's\n\ntext messages and the call and text message logs to determine if all of the information\n\nis a public record. Lindquist intervened and moved for a temporary restraining order\n\nand preliminary injunction to enjoin further disclosure of records related to his cell\n\nphone. He argued that compelling him to disclose his text messages would violate\n\nthe state and federal constitutions and was prohibited by state and federal statutes.\n\nCP at 502-18. That same day the County moved to dismiss Nissen's complaint under\n\n\n\n\n       3 The messages apparently no longer exist on Lindquist's phone. In conjunction with her\nPRA requests, however, Nissen's lawyer contacted Verizon and asked it to preserve all\n\"communications and data [on Lindquist's account] ... pending the issuance of a subpoena or\nother legal process.\" CP at 200. The propriety of that request is not before us.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nCR 12(b)(6). It argued the records at issue could not be public records as a matter\n\noflaw, because they related to a personal cell phone rather than a county-issued one.\n\n      The trial court consolidated the two motions for a hearing. After argument,\n\nthe trial judge granted the County's CR 12(b)(6) motion, determining as a matter of\n\nlaw that records of private cell phone use can never be public records under the PRA.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed. Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn. App. 581, 333\n\nP.3d 577 (2014). Applying the PRA's definition of \"public record,\" the Court of\n\nAppeals held that Lindquist's text messages were public records because he\n\n\"prepared\" them in his official capacity. Id. at 593-94 (citing RCW 42.56.010(3)).\n\nThe court further held that the factual record was not sufficiently developed on the\n\nissue of whether the call logs also qualify as \"public record[s],\" noting that the issue\n\nturned on whether Lindquist used or retained the logs in his capacity as prosecuting\n\nattorney. Id. at 595.\n\n      We granted the County's and Lindquist's petitions for review, Nissen v.\n\nPierce County, 182 Wn.2d 1008, 343 P.3d 759 (2015), and now affirm in part and\n\nremand with further instructions.\n\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review de novo a CR 12(b)(6) order dismissing a complaint. Dismissal is\n\nproper only if we conclude that \"the plaintiff cannot prove 'any set of facts which\n\nwould justify recovery.\"' Kinney v. Cook, 159 Wn.2d 837, 842, 154 P.3d 206 (2007)\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n(quoting Tenore v. AT&T Wireless Servs., 136 Wn.2d 322, 330, 962 P.2d 104\n\n(1998)). Motions to dismiss are granted \"only in the unusual case in which plaintiff\n\nincludes allegations that show on the face of the complaint that there is some\n\ninsuperable bar to relief.\" Hoffer v. State, 110 Wn.2d 415,420,755 P.2d 781 (1988)\n\n(quoting 5 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICEÂ§\n\n357, at 604 (1969)).\n\n      Our standard of review in PRA cases is also de novo. Neigh. All. of Spokane\n\nCounty v. Spokane County, 172 Wn.2d 702, 715, 261 P.3d 119 (2011).\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n      Before turning to the questions this case presents, it is helpful to clarify the\n\nquestions it does not. This case does not involve a public employer seizing an\n\nemployee's private cell phone to search for public records. It does not involve a\n\nrecords request for every piece of data on a smartphone. And it does not involve a\n\ncitizen suing a public employee for access to the employee's phone. Instead, this is\n\nan action against an agency for two types of records that, while potentially related\n\nto the agency's public business, are in the exclusive control of the agency's\n\nemployee. This case asks whether those records can nonetheless be \"public records\"\n\nthe agency must disclose and, if so, whether there are limits to how the agency may\n\nsearch for and review those records.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      With that in mind, we first interpret the PRA to determine if a record of\n\ngovernment business conducted on a private cell phone is a \"public record,\" as the\n\nPRA defines the term. We then apply that definition to the specific records here-\n\nthe call and text message logs and text messages. Finally, we address the mechanics\n\nof searching for and obtaining public records held by or in the control of public\n\nemployees. As explained below, we hold that text messages sent or received by\n\nLindquist in his official capacity can be public records of the County, regardless of\n\nthe public or private nature of the device used to create them; and we order Lindquist\n\nto obtain, segregate, and produce those public records to the County.\n\nI. THE PRA REACHES EMPLOYEE-OWNED CELL PHONES WHEN USED FOR AGENCY\n                             BUSINESS\n\n      Our analysis begins with the text of the PRA. By its plain language, the PRA\n\napplies \"when an 'agency' is requested to disclose 'public records.'\" Dawson v.\n\nDaly, 120 Wn.2d 782, 788, 845 P.2d 995 (1993). Because those are both defined\n\nterms, we must interpret the statutory definitions to decide if records of public\n\nbusiness an employee conducts on his or her private cell phone are public records.\n\nSenate Republican Campaign Comm. v. Pub. Disclosure Comm 'n, 133 Wn.2d 229,\n\n239, 943 P.2d 1358 (1997). The PRA defines \"agency\" very broadly as\n\n       all state agencies and all local agencies. \"State agency\" includes every\n       state office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other\n       state agency. \"Local agency\" includes every county, city, town,\n       municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, or special purpose\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      district, or any office, department, division, bureau, board, commission,\n      or agency thereof, or other local public agency.\n\nRCW 42.56.010(1). This definition in turn affects what information is a \"public\n\nrecord\" since it is incorporated into the statutory definition of that term. Under the\n\nPRA, a \"public record\" is\n\n      any writing containing information relating to the conduct of\n      government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary\n      function prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local\n      agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.\n\nRCW 42.56.010(3) (emphasis added).\n\n            The definitions of \"agency\" and \"public record\" are each comprehensive\n\non their own and, when taken together, mean the PRA subjects \"virtually any record\n\nrelated to the conduct of government\" to public disclosure. 4 0 'Neill, 170 Wn.2d at\n\n147. This broad construction is deliberate and meant to give the public access to\n\ninformation about every aspect of state and local government. See LAws                 OF   1973,\n\nch. 1, Â§ 1(11 ). As we so often summarize, the PRA \"is a strongly worded mandate\n\nfor broad disclosure of public records.\" Yakima County v. Yakima Herald-Republic,\n\n170 Wn.2d 775,791,246 P.3d 768 (2011) (quoting Soter v. Cowles Publ'g Co., 162\n\nWn.2d 716, 731, 174 P.3d 60 (2007) (quoting Hearst Corp. v. Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d\n\n123, 127, 580 P.2d 246 (1978))).\n\n\n\n       4\n          Disclosing that a public record exists in response to a request does not mean the record\nwill ultimately be produced. Agencies must consider whether any applicable exemption precludes\nproduction of part or all of a record. Sanders v. State, 169 Wn.2d 827, 836, 240 P.3d 120 (2010).\n\n\n                                                8\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n A. Agency Employees Working within the Scope of Employment Create Public\n                                Records\n\n      Despite that mandate, the County argues public employees can avoid the PRA\n\nsimply by using a private cell phone, even if they use it for public business and even\n\nif the same information would be a public record had they used a government-issued\n\nphone instead. 5 The County finds this large gap in the PRA by isolating the statute's\n\ndefinition of \"agency,\" which does not expressly refer to individual employees as\n\nagencies.    RCW 42.56.01 0(1 ).        Since county employees like Lindquist are not\n\nliterally a \"county,\" the County argues its employees and the records they control\n\nare completely removed from the PRA's scope.\n\n       While that reasoning may have superficial appeal, it misses the central\n\nquestion here. We cannot interpret statutory terms oblivious to the context in which\n\nthey are used. Dep't of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 10-11,\n\n43 P.3d 4 (2002). As this case does not ask if a public employee is an \"agency\" with\n\nindependent obligations separate from those the PRA imposes on the employer,\n\ninterpreting \"agency\" in isolation is unhelpful. Nissen's request was directed at the\n\nCounty, not Lindquist. 6 Our task instead is to decide if records that a public\n\n\n       5\n          The County admits that this is the natural result of its interpretation of the PRA. Wash.\nSupreme Court oral argument, Nissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3 (June 11, 2015), at 3 min., 4\nsec., and 6 min., 57 sec., audio recording by TVW, Washington State's Public Affairs Network,\nhttp://www.tvw.org.\n        6 Whether an elected official is independently subject to the PRA is an unsettled question.\n\nSee Bldg. Indus. Ass 'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 746, 218 P.3d 196 (2009). Here,\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nemployee generates while working for an agency are \"public records\" that the\n\nagency must disclose. Thus we must interpret the statutory definitions of \"agency\"\n\nand \"public record\" together, keeping in mind the purpose those definitions are\n\nintended to further. See Hearst Corp., 90 Wn.2d at 128.\n\n       One characteristic of a public record is that it is \"prepared, owned, used, or\n\nretained by any state or local agency.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). The County is correct\n\nthat every agency the PRA identifies is a political body arising under law (e.g., a\n\ncounty). But those bodies lack an innate ability to prepare, own, use, or retain any\n\nrecord. They instead act exclusively through their employees and other agents, and\n\nwhen an employee acts within the scope of his or her employment, the employee's\n\nactions are tantamount to \"the actions of the [body] itself.\" Houser v. City of\n\nRedmond, 91 Wn.2d 36, 40, 586 P.2d 482 (1978) (as to cities); Hailey v. King\n\nCounty, 21 Wn.2d 53, 58, 149 P.2d 823 (1944) (as to counties). Integrating this\n\nbasic common law concept into the PRA, a record that an agency employee prepares,\n\nowns, uses, or retains in the scope of employment is necessarily a record \"prepared,\n\nowned, used, or retained by [a] state or local agency.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\n\n\n\nhowever, Nissen did not sue Lindquist, either in his individual or official capacity. She instead\nsued the County, alleging that Lindquist's use of his cell phone resulted in public records of the\nCounty; Lindquist is a party only because he intervened to enjoin disclosure. The relevant question\nthen is not whether Lindquist is individually subject to the PRA but, rather, whether records he\nhandles in his capacity as the prosecutor are county public records.\n\n\n                                                10\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n       That interpretation is the only logical one considering how agencies conduct\n\nbusiness and carry out their obligations under the PRA. See Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at\n\n789 (public records were \"prepared by the prosecutor's office\" because two\n\nemployees created and compiled them).          If the PRA did not capture records\n\nindividual employees prepare, own, use, or retain in the course of their jobs, the\n\npublic would be without information about much of the daily operation of\n\ngovernment. Such a result would be an affront to the core policy underpinning the\n\nPRA-the public's right to a transparent government. That policy, itself embodied\n\nin the statutory text, guides our interpretation of the PRA. RCW 42.56.030; LAWS\n\nOF   1973, ch. 1, Â§ 1(11); Hearst Corp., 90 Wn.2d at 128.\n\n           B. The PRA Captures Work Product on Employee Cell Phones\n\n        With that understanding, it is clear that an agency's \"public records\" include\n\nthe work product of its employees. And we find nothing in the text or purpose of\n\nthe PRA supporting the County's suggestion that only work product made using\n\nagency property can be a public record. To the contrary, the PRA is explicit that\n\ninformation qualifies as a public record \"regardless of [its] physical form or\n\ncharacteristics.\" RCW 42.56.01 0(3 ). In 0 'Neill we held that a city official stored a\n\npublic record on a private computer in her home by using the computer for city\n\nbusiness, 170 Wn.2d at 150, which is consistent with the idea that employees can\n\nuse their own property and still be within the scope of their employment.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nDickinson v. Edwards, 105 Wn.2d 457, 467-68, 716 P.2d 814 (1986). There is no\n\nreason to treat cell phones differently. We hold that records an agency employee\n\nprepares, owns, uses, or retains on a private cell phone within the scope of\n\nemployment can be a public record if they also meet the other requirements ofRCW\n\n42.56.010(3).\n\n      Applying the PRAto employee cell phone use is not new. Though an issue\n\nof first impression in this court, many state and local agencies implementing the\n\nPRA already conclude that using a private cell phone to conduct public business can\n\ncreate a public record. Over the last several years, agencies have begun adopting\n\npolicies about private cell phone use and advising employees of the agencies'\n\nobligation to preserve all public records. Just as examples:\n\n   â¢ \"Employees utilizing cell phones for City business must not utilize\n     written cell phone capabilities such as text messaging or email for City\n     business unless such phone is synchronized with the City's computer\n     system so that such electronic records can be maintained according to\n     the State records retention requirements.\"         CITY OF PROSSER,\n     PERSONNEL POLICY MANUAL 32 (2009) (Policy 403: Cell Phone\n     Allowance).\n\n   â¢ \"All county business generated on personal mobile devices are subject\n     to the Public Records Act. ... Text messages sent and received on a\n     personal mobile device are not stored in any other form. Employees\n     shall not use texting for any County business.\" THURSTON COUNTY\n     ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL (2012) Â§ 10 (Personal Mobile Device\n     Policy).\n\n   â¢ \"Employees should be aware that work-related texts and voice\n     messages on cell phones are public records subject to the Public\n     Records Act. Employees have a duty to maintain such records in\n\n                                         12\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      accordance with the Washington Local Government Record Retention\n      Schedules.\" CITY OF GRANDVIEW, PERSONNEL POLICY MANUAL 88\n      (2013) (use of personal cellular telephones to conduct city business),\n      http://www.grandview.wa.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/\n      Personnel-Policy-Manuall.pdf.\n\nThese policies are comparable to many others around the state and are consistent\n\nwith the attorney general's understanding of the PRA. See WAC 44-14-03001(3).\n\nWhile these interpretations do not bind us, 0 'Neill, 170 Wn.2d at 149, they discredit\n\nthe County's assertion that private cell phone use has always been treated as outside\n\nthe PRA.\n\n      Similarly unpersuasive is the County's warning that every \"work-related\"\n\npersonal communication is now a public record subject to disclosure. Traditional\n\nnotions of principal-agency law alleviate this concern. For information to be a public\n\nrecord, an employee must prepare, own, use, or retain it within the scope of\n\nemployment. An employee's communication is \"within the scope of employment\"\n\nonly when the job requires it, the employer directs it, or it furthers the employer's\n\ninterests. Greene v. St. Paul-Mercury Inde.m. Co., 51 Wn.2d 569, 573, 320 P.2d 311\n\n(1958) (citingLunz v. Dep 't ofLabor &Indus., 50 Wn.2d 273, 310 P.2d 880 (1957);\n\nRoletto v. Dep 't Stores Garage Co., 30 Wn.2d 439, 191 P.2d 875 (1948)). This\n\nlimits the reach of the PRA to records related to the employee's public\n\nresponsibilities. For instance, employees do not generally act within the scope of\n\nemployment when they text their spouse about working late or discuss their job on\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nsocial media. Nor do they typically act within the scope of employment by creating\n\nor keeping records purely for private use, like a diary. None of these examples would\n\nresult in a public record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by the employer\n\nagency in the usual case. 7\n\n      Agencies can act only through their employee-agents. With respect to an\n\nagency's obligations under the PRA, the acts of an employee in the scope of\n\nemployment are necessarily acts of the \"state and local agenc[ies]\" under RCW\n\n42.56.010(3). We therefore reject the County's argument that records related to an\n\nemployee's private cell phone can never be public records as a matter of law.\n\nInstead, records an employee prepares, owns, uses, or retains within the scope of\n\nemployment are public records if they meet all the requirements of RCW\n\n42.56.010(3). This inquiry is always case- and record-specific. Cf Predisik v.\n\nSpokane Sch. Dist. No. 81, 182 Wn.2d 896, 906, 346 P.3d 737 (2015).\n\n     II. APPLYING THE PRATO THE CALL AND TEXT MESSAGE LOGS AND TEXT\n                                MESSAGES\n\n       We next apply RCW 42.56.010(3) to the records at issue here-the call and\n\ntext message logs and text messages.                To be a public record under RCW\n\n42.56.010(3), information must be (1) a writing (2) related to the conduct of\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        We offer these generic illustrations in response to hypotheticals raised by the County and\nsome amici. Of course, the facts of every case vary. We do not intend these illustrations to have\nprecedential effect.\n\n\n                                               14\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\ngovernment or the performance of government functions that is (3) prepared, owned,\n\nused, or retained by a state or local agency. Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis\n\nReservation v. Johnson, 135 Wn.2d 734,746, 958 P.2d 260 (1998). The first element\n\nis not in dispute-the parties agree that the call and text message logs and text\n\nmessages are \"writings\" under the PRA. See RCW 42.56.010(4). The remaining\n\ntwo elements are discussed in turn.\n\n               A. Records Relating to the Conduct of Government\n\n      Public records must \"relat[ e] to the conduct of government or the performance\n\nof any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). This language\n\ncasts a wide net. In Confederated Tribes, for example, we held that records of money\n\npaid by Indian tribes into a common fund related to the conduct of the government\n\neven though the records related primarily to tribal gaming operations. 135 Wn.2d at\n\n739-43. Since the state received money from the common fund, we determined tribal\n\ncontributions impacted state government and therefore records of those\n\ncontributions were public records. Id. at 748.\n\n      We adopted a similarly broad interpretation in Oliver v. Harborview Med.\n\nCtr., 94 Wn.2d 559, 618 P.2d 76 (1980), which involved medical records ofpatients\n\nhospitalized at a state-owned facility. The records there unquestionably related to\n\nindividual patients and did not explicitly discuss government operations, but we still\n\nheld that the records \"relat[ ed] to the conduct of government\" under RCW\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n42.56.010(3). From them the public could learn about the \"administration of health\n\ncare services, facility availability, use and care, methods of diagnosis, analysis,\n\ntreatment and costs, all of which are carried out or relate to the performance of a\n\ngovernmental or proprietary function.\" Oliver, 94 Wn.2d at 566.\n\n      Together these cases suggest records can qualify as public records if they\n\ncontain any information that refers to or impacts the actions, processes, and functions\n\nof government. 8\n\n           B. Records Prepared, Owned, Used, or Retained by an Agency\n\n      As explained previously, a public record must also be \"prepared, owned, used,\n\nor retained\" by an agency, which includes an agency employee acting within the\n\nscope of employment. But the parties still quarrel over the meaning of these verbs,\n\nwhich requires that we further interpret RCW 42.56.010(3). Statutory interpretation\n\nstarts with the plain meaning of the language; the plain meaning controls if it is\n\nunambiguous. Campbell, 146 Wn.2d at 11-12. We may use a dictionary to discern\n\nthe plain meaning of an undefined statutory term. HomeStreet, Inc. v. Dep 't of\n\nRevenue, 166 Wn.2d 444,451,210 P.3d 297 (2009) (citing Garrison v. Wash. State\n\nNursing Bd., 87 Wn.2d 195, 196, 550 P.2d 7 (1996)).\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         It is worth repeating that records an employee maintains in a personal capacity will not\nqualify as public records, even if they refer to, comment on, or mention the employee's public\nduties.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      \"Prepared.\" \"Prepare\" is defined as \"to put together\"; to \"MAKE, PRODUCE\";\n\n\"to put into written form.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY\n\n1790 (2002).    This interpretation is consistent with previous cases that treat\n\n\"preparing\" a record as creating it. See Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 787 (agency prepared\n\nrecord by \"creat[ing] one ofthe files\"); Oliver, 94 Wn.2d at 566 (records of patient's\n\nhospitalization prepared by the hospital).\n\n      \"Owned.\" To \"own\" a record means \"to have or hold [it] as property.\"\n\nWEBSTER's, supra, at 1612; see also 0 'Neill v. City ofShoreline, 145 Wn. App. 913,\n\n925, 187 P.3d 822 (2008).\n\n       \"Used.\" We previously addressed what it means for an agency to \"use\" a\n\nrecord. We broadly interpreted the term in Concerned Ratepayers Ass 'n v. Pub. Uti!.\n\nDist. No. 1 of Clark County, 138 Wn.2d 950, 960,983 P.2d 635 (1999), holding that\n\nthe \"critical inquiry is whether the requested information bears a nexus with the\n\nagency's decision-making process.\" A record that is prepared and held by a third\n\nparty, without more, is not a public record. But if an agency \"evaluat[es], review[s],\n\nor refer[ s]\" to a record in the course of its business, the agency \"uses\" the record\n\nwithin the meaning of the PRA. Id. at 962.\n\n      \"Retained.\" To \"retain\" a record means \"to hold or continue to hold [it] in\n\npossession or use.\" WEBSTER'S, supra, at 1938.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nC. The Text Messages Are Potentially Public Records; the Call and Text Message\n                               Logs Are Not\n\n      We now apply those definitions to decide if the complaint sufficiently alleges\n\nthat the call logs and text messages are \"public records.\" Absent an allegation that\n\nthe County used the call and text message logs, the logs in this case are not public\n\nrecords. The call and text message logs were prepared and retained by Verizon, and\n\nNissen does not contend that the County evaluated, reviewed, or took any other\n\naction with the logs necessary to \"use\" them. Concerned Ratepayers, 138 Wn.2d at\n\n962. Though they evidence the acts of a public employee, the call and text message\n\nlogs played no role in County business as records themselves. We hold that the\n\ncomplaint fails to allege the call and text message logs are \"public records\" of the\n\nCounty within the meaning of RCW 42.56.010(3) because the County did nothing\n\nwith them.\n\n      We reach a different conclusion as to text messages. Nissen sufficiently\n\nalleges that Lindquist sent and received text messages in his official capacity \"to\n\ntake actions retaliating against her and other official misconduct.\" CP at 14. When\n\nacting within the scope of his employment, Lindquist prepares outgoing text\n\nmessages by \"putting them into written form\" and sending them. Similarly, he\n\n\"used\" incoming text messages when he reviewed and replied to them while within\n\nthe scope of employment. Since the County and Lindquist admit that some text\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nmessages might be \"work related,\" the complaint sufficiently alleges that those\n\nmessages meet all three elements of a \"public record\" under RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\n       Transcripts of the content of those text messages are thus potentially public\n\nrecords subject to disclosure, consistent with the procedure discussed below.\n\n                      III. SEARCHING FOR PUBLIC RECORDS WITHIN\n                                 AN EMPLOYEE'S CONTROL\n\n       We finally turn to the mechanics of searching for and obtaining public records\n\nstored by or in the control of an employee. The County and Lindquist suggest that\n\nvarious provisions of the state and federal constitutions categorically prohibit a\n\npublic employer from obtaining public records related to private cell phone use\n\nwithout consent. 9 Because an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in a\n\npublic record, 10 Lindquist's challenge is necessarily grounded in the constitutional\n\nrights he has in personal information comingled with those public records. We are\n\nmindful that today's mobile devices often contain \"a 'wealth of detail about [a\n\nperson's] familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\"'\n\nState v. Hinton, 179 Wn.2d 862, 869, 319 P.3d 9 (2014) (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting United States v. Jones, 565 U.S._, 132 S. Ct. 945, 955, 181 L. Ed. 2d\n\n911 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring)).

Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nnow communicate, access the Internet, store documents, and manage appointments\n\non their smartphone, cell phones are fast becoming an indispensable fixture in\n\npeople's private and professional lives. Text messaging is the most widely used\n\nsmartphone feature; e-mail is not far behind. Aaron Smith, US. Smartphone Use in\n\n2015, PEW RESEARCH CTR. (Apr. 1, 2015), http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/\n\nus-smartphone-use-in-2015.\n\n      Yet the ability of public employees to use cell phones to conduct public\n\nbusiness by creating and exchanging public records-text messages, e-mails, or\n\nanything else-is why the PRA must offer the public a way to obtain those records.\n\nWithout one, the PRA cannot fulfill the people's mandate to have \"full access to\n\ninformation concerning the conduct of government on every level.\" LAws OF 1973,\n\nch. 1, Â§ 1( 11 ). As noted earlier, many counties, cities, and agencies around the state\n\nrecognize the need to capture and retain public records created on personal devices.\n\nSome of those entities provide employees with a way to preserve public records and\n\navoid any inquiry into their private affairs by, for example, syncing work-related\n                                                I\n\n\ndocuments, e-mails, and text messages to an agency server or other place accessible\n\nto the employer. The County apparently has no such policy.\n\n      While a policy easing the burden on employees of preserving public records\n\nis certainly helpful, it cannot be a precondition to the public's right to access those\n\nrecords. If it were, the effectiveness of the PRA would hinge on \"the whim of the\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\npublic officials whose activities it is designed to regulate.\" Mead Sch. Dist. No.\n\n354 v. Mead Educ. Ass 'n, 85 Wn.2d 140, 145, 530 P.2d 302 (1975). The legislature\n\ntasks us with interpreting the PRA liberally and in light of the people's insistence\n\nthat they have information about the workings of the government they created. RCW\n\n42.56.030.   Of course, the public's statutory right to public records does not\n\nextinguish an individual's constitutional rights in private information. But we do\n\nnot read the PRA as a zero-sum choice between personal liberty and government\n\naccountability. Instead, we turn to well-settled principles of public disclosure law\n\nand hold that an employee's good-faith search for public records on his or her\n\npersonal device can satisfy an agency's obligations under the PRA.\n\n      Though technology evolves, segregating public records from nonpublic ones\n\nis nothing new for agencies responding to a PRA request. Whether stored in a file\n\ncabinet or a cell phone, the PRA has never authorized \"unbridled searches\" of every\n\npiece of information held by an agency or its employees to find records the citizen\n\nbelieves are responsive to a request. Hangartner v. City of Seattle, 151 Wn.2d 439,\n\n448, 90 P.3d 26 (2004). The onus is instead on the agency-necessarily through its\n\nemployees-to perform \"an adequate search\" for the records requested. Neigh. All.,\n\n172 Wn.2d at 720-21. To satisfy the agency's burden to show it conducted an\n\nadequate search for records, we permit employees in good faith to submit\n\n\"reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits\" attesting to the nature and extent of\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\ntheir search. Id. at 721. The PRA allows a trial court to resolve disputes about the\n\nnature of a record \"based solely on affidavits,\" RCW 42.56.550(3), without an in\n\ncamera review, without searching for records itself, and without infringing on an\n\nindividual's constitutional privacy interest in private information he or she keeps at\n\nwork.\n\n        Federal courts implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 89-487, 80 Stat. 250, allow individual employees to use the same method to self-\n\nsegregate private and public records. See, e.g., Media Research Ctr. v. US. Dep 't\n\nof Justice, 818 F. Supp. 2d 131, 139-40 (D.D.C. 2011) (declarations sufficient to\n\ndetermine e-mails were not sent in employee's official capacity); Consumer Fed'n\n\nofAm. v. Dep 't of Agric., 455 F.3d 283, 288-89 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (affidavits from\n\nemployees about character of electronic calendars); Bloomberg, LP v. US. Sec. &\n\nExch. Comm 'n, 357 F. Supp. 2d 156, 163 (D.D.C. 2004) (affidavits about \"telephone\n\nlogs\" and message slips); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Clinton, 880 F. Supp. 1, 11-12\n\n(D.D.C. 1995); Gallant v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd., 26 F.3d 168, 171 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1994). While \"[a]n agency cannot require an employee to produce and submit for\n\nreview a purely personal document when responding to a FOIA request[,] ... it does\n\ncontrol the employee to the extent that the employee works for the agency on agency\n\nmatters.\" Ethyl Corp. v. US. Envt'l Prot. Agency, 25 F.3d 1241, 1247 (4th Cir.\n\n1994). Thus, where a federal employee asserts a potentially responsive record is\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\npersonal, he or she must provide the employer and \"the courts with the opportunity\n\nto evaluate the facts and reach their own conclusions\" about whether the record is\n\nsubject to FOIA. Grand Cent. P'ship, Inc. v. Cuomo, 166 F.3d 473, 480-81 (2d Cir.\n\n1999). We already incorporate FO IA' s standard for adequate searches into the PRA,\n\nNeigh. All., 172 Wn.2d at 720, and we similarly adopt FOIA's affidavit procedure\n\nfor an employee's personally held public records.\n\n      Therefore, we hold agency employees are responsible for searching their files,\n\ndevices, and accounts for records responsive to a relevant PRA request. Employees\n\nmust produce any public records (e-mails, text messages, and any other type of data)\n\nto the employer agency. The agency then proceeds just as it would when responding\n\nto a request for public records in the agency's possession by reviewing each record,\n\ndetermining if some or all of the record is exempted from production, and disclosing\n\nthe record to the requester. See generally Resident Action Council v. Seattle Hous.\n\nAuth., 177 Wn.2d 417, 436-37, 327 P.3d 600 (2013).\n\n       Where an employee withholds personal records from the employer, he or she\n\nmust submit an affidavit with facts sufficient to show the information is not a \"public\n\nrecord\" under the PRA. So long as the affidavits give the requester and the trial\n\ncourt a sufficient factual basis to determine that withheld material is indeed\n\nnonresponsive, the agency has performed an adequate search under the PRA. When\n\ndone in good faith, this procedure allows an agency to fulfill its responsibility to\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nsearch for and disclose public records without unnecessarily treading on the\n\nconstitutional rights of its employees.\n\n      We recognize this procedure might be criticized as too easily abused or too\n\ndeferential to employees' judgment. Certainly the same can be said of any search\n\nfor public records, not just for records related to employee cell phone use. But we\n\noffer two specific responses. First, an employee's judgment would often be required\n\nto help identify public records on a cell phone, even in an in camera review. Text\n\nmessages, for example, are short communications whose meaning may not be self-\n\napparent.   Unlike a chain of e-mails where the preceding messages are often\n\nreplicated in the body of each new reply, text messages may contain only a few\n\nwords. The employee then might be needed to put that message into context to\n\ndetermine if it meets the statutory definition of a \"public record.\"\n\n       Second, those criticisms spotlight why agencies should develop ways to\n\ncapture public records related to employee cell phone use. The people enacted the\n\nPRA \"mindful ofthe right of individuals to privacy,\" LAWS OF 1973, ch. 1, Â§ 1(11),\n\nand individuals do not sacrifice all constitutional protection by accepting public\n\nemployment. City of Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.S. 746, 756, 130 S. Ct. 2619, 177 L.\n\nEd. 2d 216 (20 10). Agencies are in the best position to implement policies that fulfill\n\ntheir obligations under the PRA yet also preserve the privacy rights of their\n\nemployees. E-mails can be routed through agency servers, documents can be cached\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nto agency-controlled cloud services, and instant messagmg apps can store\n\nconversations. Agencies could provide employees with an agency-issued device that\n\nthe agency retains a right to access, or they could prohibit the use of personal devices\n\naltogether. That these may be more effective ways to address employee cell phone\n\nuse, however, does not diminish the PRA's directive that we liberally construe it\n\nhere to promote access to all public records. RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the Court of Appeals in part. Records that an agency employee\n\nprepares, owns, uses, or retains on a private cell phone within the scope of\n\nemployment can be \"public records\" of the agency under RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\nNissen's complaint thus sufficiently alleges that at least some of the text messages\n\nat issue may be public records subject to disclosure. Because it is impossible at this\n\nstage to determine if any messages are in fact public records, on remand the parties\n\nare directed as follows.

Today we\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nconsider if the PRA similarly applies when a public employee uses a private cell\n\nphone to conduct government business.                  We hold that text messages sent and\n\nreceived by a public employee in the employee's official capacity are public records\n\nof the employer, even if the employee uses a private cell phone.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n      This case involves two requests for public records that Glenda Nissen, a\n\nsheriffs detective, sent to Pierce County (County). Both requests asked for records\n\nrelated to Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist. One request stated:\n\n      Please produce any and all of Mark Lindquist's cellular telephone\n      records for number 253-861-[XXXX 1] or any other cellular telephone\n      he uses to conduct his business including text messages from August 2,\n      2011.\n\nClerk's Papers (CP) at 15. The other stated:\n\n      The new public records request is for Mark Lindquist's cellular\n      telephone records for number 253-861-[XXXX] for June 7, [2010]J2]\n\nId. at 17 (second alteration in original). The telephone number identified in these\n\nrequests is connected to Lindquist's private cell phone. There is no dispute that\n\nLindquist personally bought the phone, pays for its monthly service, and sometimes\n\nuses it in the course of his job.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           Though redacted in the record before us, the requests contained the full 10-digit telephone\nnumber.\n       2 The County has not challenged the breadth or specificity of these requests, and we pass\nno opinion.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      In response to these requests, Lindquist obtained and provided the County\n\nwith two types of records. The first, which the parties refer to as the \"call log,\" is\n\nsimilar to an itemized statement customers might receive from their service provider\n\neach month. It contains information about the dates and times of calls made and\n\nreceived, the length of those calls, and the telephone number of the incoming or\n\noutgoing call. Lindquist's service provider, Verizon Wireless, generated the call log\n\nand provided it to Lindquist at his request. He voluntarily produced it to the County.\n\n      The second type of record reveals information about text messages Lindquist\n\nsent and received over two days (\"text message log\"). The text message log does\n\nnot reveal the content of those messages. Instead, similar to the call log, it itemizes\n\nthe date and time of each message and provides the telephone number of the\n\ncorresponding party. Lindquist also obtained the text message log from Verizon\n\nafter receiving Nissen's PRA requests and produced it to the County.\n\n       The County reviewed the call and text message logs and disclosed partially\n\nredacted copies to Nissen.     Accompanied by an exemption log, the redactions\n\nconceal line items for calls and text messages that Lindquist self-described as\n\npersonal in nature.    The remaining unredacted portions relate to calls and text\n\nmessages that the County and Lindquist admit might be work related. See CP at 490\n\n(Decl. of Mark Lindquist in Supp. of Mot. To Intervene & Join) (\"I authorized the\n\nrelease of records of calls that were related to the conduct of government or the\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fNissen v.

Thus nearly half of\n\nthe text messages Lindquist sent or received and many of his phone calls during the\n\nrelevant period potentially related to his job as the elected prosecutor. The County\n\ndid not produce the contents of any text message, however, though copies of them\n\nexist on V erizon' s servers. 3\n\n       Dissatisfied with the County's disclosures, Nissen sued the County in\n\nThurston County Superior Court. She sought an in camera review of Lindquist's\n\ntext messages and the call and text message logs to determine if all of the information\n\nis a public record. Lindquist intervened and moved for a temporary restraining order\n\nand preliminary injunction to enjoin further disclosure of records related to his cell\n\nphone. He argued that compelling him to disclose his text messages would violate\n\nthe state and federal constitutions and was prohibited by state and federal statutes.\n\nCP at 502-18. That same day the County moved to dismiss Nissen's complaint under\n\n\n\n\n       3 The messages apparently no longer exist on Lindquist's phone. In conjunction with her\nPRA requests, however, Nissen's lawyer contacted Verizon and asked it to preserve all\n\"communications and data [on Lindquist's account] ... pending the issuance of a subpoena or\nother legal process.\" CP at 200. The propriety of that request is not before us.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nCR 12(b)(6). It argued the records at issue could not be public records as a matter\n\noflaw, because they related to a personal cell phone rather than a county-issued one.\n\n      The trial court consolidated the two motions for a hearing. After argument,\n\nthe trial judge granted the County's CR 12(b)(6) motion, determining as a matter of\n\nlaw that records of private cell phone use can never be public records under the PRA.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed.

This case does not involve a public employer seizing an\n\nemployee's private cell phone to search for public records. It does not involve a\n\nrecords request for every piece of data on a smartphone. And it does not involve a\n\ncitizen suing a public employee for access to the employee's phone. Instead, this is\n\nan action against an agency for two types of records that, while potentially related\n\nto the agency's public business, are in the exclusive control of the agency's\n\nemployee. This case asks whether those records can nonetheless be \"public records\"\n\nthe agency must disclose and, if so, whether there are limits to how the agency may\n\nsearch for and review those records.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n      With that in mind, we first interpret the PRA to determine if a record of\n\ngovernment business conducted on a private cell phone is a \"public record,\" as the\n\nPRA defines the term. We then apply that definition to the specific records here-\n\nthe call and text message logs and text messages. Finally, we address the mechanics\n\nof searching for and obtaining public records held by or in the control of public\n\nemployees. As explained below, we hold that text messages sent or received by\n\nLindquist in his official capacity can be public records of the County, regardless of\n\nthe public or private nature of the device used to create them; and we order Lindquist\n\nto obtain, segregate, and produce those public records to the County.\n\nI. THE PRA REACHES EMPLOYEE-OWNED CELL PHONES WHEN USED FOR AGENCY\n                             BUSINESS\n\n      Our analysis begins with the text of the PRA. By its plain language, the PRA\n\napplies \"when an 'agency' is requested to disclose 'public records.'\" Dawson v.\n\nDaly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201996\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201996/dawson-v-daly/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201996\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201996/dawson-v-daly/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Because those are both defined\n\nterms, we must interpret the statutory definitions to decide if records of public\n\nbusiness an employee conducts on his or her private cell phone are public records.\n\nSenate Republican Campaign Comm. v.

The PRA defines \"agency\" very broadly as\n\n       all state agencies and all local agencies. \"State agency\" includes every\n       state office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other\n       state agency. \"Local agency\" includes every county, city, town,\n       municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, or special purpose\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fNissen v.

This definition in turn affects what information is a \"public\n\nrecord\" since it is incorporated into the statutory definition of that term. Under the\n\nPRA, a \"public record\" is\n\n      any writing containing information relating to the conduct of\n      government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary\n      function prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local\n      agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.\n\nRCW 42.56.010(3) (emphasis added).\n\n            The definitions of \"agency\" and \"public record\" are each comprehensive\n\non their own and, when taken together, mean the PRA subjects \"virtually any record\n\nrelated to the conduct of government\" to public disclosure. 4 0 'Neill, 170 Wn.2d at\n\n147. This broad construction is deliberate and meant to give the public access to\n\ninformation about every aspect of state and local government. See LAws                 OF   1973,\n\nch. 1, Â§ 1(11 ).

Agency Employees Working within the Scope of Employment Create Public\n                                Records\n\n      Despite that mandate, the County argues public employees can avoid the PRA\n\nsimply by using a private cell phone, even if they use it for public business and even\n\nif the same information would be a public record had they used a government-issued\n\nphone instead. 5 The County finds this large gap in the PRA by isolating the statute's\n\ndefinition of \"agency,\" which does not expressly refer to individual employees as\n\nagencies.    RCW 42.56.01 0(1 ).        Since county employees like Lindquist are not\n\nliterally a \"county,\" the County argues its employees and the records they control\n\nare completely removed from the PRA's scope.\n\n       While that reasoning may have superficial appeal, it misses the central\n\nquestion here.

Thus we must interpret the statutory definitions of \"agency\"\n\nand \"public record\" together, keeping in mind the purpose those definitions are\n\nintended to further. See Hearst Corp., 90 Wn.2d at 128.\n\n       One characteristic of a public record is that it is \"prepared, owned, used, or\n\nretained by any state or local agency.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). The County is correct\n\nthat every agency the PRA identifies is a political body arising under law (e.g., a\n\ncounty). But those bodies lack an innate ability to prepare, own, use, or retain any\n\nrecord. They instead act exclusively through their employees and other agents, and\n\nwhen an employee acts within the scope of his or her employment, the employee's\n\nactions are tantamount to \"the actions of the [body] itself.\" Houser v.

Integrating this\n\nbasic common law concept into the PRA, a record that an agency employee prepares,\n\nowns, uses, or retains in the scope of employment is necessarily a record \"prepared,\n\nowned, used, or retained by [a] state or local agency.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\n\n\n\nhowever, Nissen did not sue Lindquist, either in his individual or official capacity. She instead\nsued the County, alleging that Lindquist's use of his cell phone resulted in public records of the\nCounty; Lindquist is a party only because he intervened to enjoin disclosure. The relevant question\nthen is not whether Lindquist is individually subject to the PRA but, rather, whether records he\nhandles in his capacity as the prosecutor are county public records.\n\n\n                                                10\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n       That interpretation is the only logical one considering how agencies conduct\n\nbusiness and carry out their obligations under the PRA. See Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at\n\n789 (public records were \"prepared by the prosecutor's office\" because two\n\nemployees created and compiled them).          If the PRA did not capture records\n\nindividual employees prepare, own, use, or retain in the course of their jobs, the\n\npublic would be without information about much of the daily operation of\n\ngovernment. Such a result would be an affront to the core policy underpinning the\n\nPRA-the public's right to a transparent government. That policy, itself embodied\n\nin the statutory text, guides our interpretation of the PRA. RCW 42.56.030; LAWS\n\nOF   1973, ch. 1, Â§ 1(11); Hearst Corp., 90 Wn.2d at 128.\n\n           B. The PRA Captures Work Product on Employee Cell Phones\n\n        With that understanding, it is clear that an agency's \"public records\" include\n\nthe work product of its employees. And we find nothing in the text or purpose of\n\nthe PRA supporting the County's suggestion that only work product made using\n\nagency property can be a public record. To the contrary, the PRA is explicit that\n\ninformation qualifies as a public record \"regardless of [its] physical form or\n\ncharacteristics.\" RCW 42.56.01 0(3 ). In 0 'Neill we held that a city official stored a\n\npublic record on a private computer in her home by using the computer for city\n\nbusiness, 170 Wn.2d at 150, which is consistent with the idea that employees can\n\nuse their own property and still be within the scope of their employment.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fNissen v.

There is no\n\nreason to treat cell phones differently. We hold that records an agency employee\n\nprepares, owns, uses, or retains on a private cell phone within the scope of\n\nemployment can be a public record if they also meet the other requirements ofRCW\n\n42.56.010(3).\n\n      Applying the PRAto employee cell phone use is not new. Though an issue\n\nof first impression in this court, many state and local agencies implementing the\n\nPRA already conclude that using a private cell phone to conduct public business can\n\ncreate a public record. Over the last several years, agencies have begun adopting\n\npolicies about private cell phone use and advising employees of the agencies'\n\nobligation to preserve all public records. Just as examples:\n\n   â¢ \"Employees utilizing cell phones for City business must not utilize\n     written cell phone capabilities such as text messaging or email for City\n     business unless such phone is synchronized with the City's computer\n     system so that such electronic records can be maintained according to\n     the State records retention requirements.\"         CITY OF PROSSER,\n     PERSONNEL POLICY MANUAL 32 (2009) (Policy 403: Cell Phone\n     Allowance).\n\n   â¢ \"All county business generated on personal mobile devices are subject\n     to the Public Records Act. ... Text messages sent and received on a\n     personal mobile device are not stored in any other form. Employees\n     shall not use texting for any County business.\" THURSTON COUNTY\n     ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL (2012) Â§ 10 (Personal Mobile Device\n     Policy).\n\n   â¢ \"Employees should be aware that work-related texts and voice\n     messages on cell phones are public records subject to the Public\n     Records Act. Employees have a duty to maintain such records in\n\n                                         12\n\fNissen v.

See WAC 44-14-03001(3).\n\nWhile these interpretations do not bind us, 0 'Neill, 170 Wn.2d at 149, they discredit\n\nthe County's assertion that private cell phone use has always been treated as outside\n\nthe PRA.\n\n      Similarly unpersuasive is the County's warning that every \"work-related\"\n\npersonal communication is now a public record subject to disclosure. Traditional\n\nnotions of principal-agency law alleviate this concern. For information to be a public\n\nrecord, an employee must prepare, own, use, or retain it within the scope of\n\nemployment. An employee's communication is \"within the scope of employment\"\n\nonly when the job requires it, the employer directs it, or it furthers the employer's\n\ninterests. Greene v.

This\n\nlimits the reach of the PRA to records related to the employee's public\n\nresponsibilities. For instance, employees do not generally act within the scope of\n\nemployment when they text their spouse about working late or discuss their job on\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nsocial media. Nor do they typically act within the scope of employment by creating\n\nor keeping records purely for private use, like a diary. None of these examples would\n\nresult in a public record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by the employer\n\nagency in the usual case. 7\n\n      Agencies can act only through their employee-agents. With respect to an\n\nagency's obligations under the PRA, the acts of an employee in the scope of\n\nemployment are necessarily acts of the \"state and local agenc[ies]\" under RCW\n\n42.56.010(3). We therefore reject the County's argument that records related to an\n\nemployee's private cell phone can never be public records as a matter of law.\n\nInstead, records an employee prepares, owns, uses, or retains within the scope of\n\nemployment are public records if they meet all the requirements of RCW\n\n42.56.010(3). This inquiry is always case- and record-specific. Cf Predisik v.\n\nSpokane Sch. Dist.

APPLYING THE PRATO THE CALL AND TEXT MESSAGE LOGS AND TEXT\n                                MESSAGES\n\n       We next apply RCW 42.56.010(3) to the records at issue here-the call and\n\ntext message logs and text messages.                To be a public record under RCW\n\n42.56.010(3), information must be (1) a writing (2) related to the conduct of\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        We offer these generic illustrations in response to hypotheticals raised by the County and\nsome amici.

The first element\n\nis not in dispute-the parties agree that the call and text message logs and text\n\nmessages are \"writings\" under the PRA. See RCW 42.56.010(4). The remaining\n\ntwo elements are discussed in turn.\n\n               A. Records Relating to the Conduct of Government\n\n      Public records must \"relat[ e] to the conduct of government or the performance\n\nof any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). This language\n\ncasts a wide net. In Confederated Tribes, for example, we held that records of money\n\npaid by Indian tribes into a common fund related to the conduct of the government\n\neven though the records related primarily to tribal gaming operations. 135 Wn.2d at\n\n739-43. Since the state received money from the common fund, we determined tribal\n\ncontributions impacted state government and therefore records of those\n\ncontributions were public records. Id. at 748.\n\n      We adopted a similarly broad interpretation in Oliver v. Harborview Med.\n\nCtr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1391745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1391745/oliver-v-harborview-med-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1391745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1391745/oliver-v-harborview-med-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980), which involved medical records ofpatients\n\nhospitalized at a state-owned facility. The records there unquestionably related to\n\nindividual patients and did not explicitly discuss government operations, but we still\n\nheld that the records \"relat[ ed] to the conduct of government\" under RCW\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\n42.56.010(3). From them the public could learn about the \"administration of health\n\ncare services, facility availability, use and care, methods of diagnosis, analysis,\n\ntreatment and costs, all of which are carried out or relate to the performance of a\n\ngovernmental or proprietary function.\" Oliver, 94 Wn.2d at 566.\n\n      Together these cases suggest records can qualify as public records if they\n\ncontain any information that refers to or impacts the actions, processes, and functions\n\nof government. 8\n\n           B. Records Prepared, Owned, Used, or Retained by an Agency\n\n      As explained previously, a public record must also be \"prepared, owned, used,\n\nor retained\" by an agency, which includes an agency employee acting within the\n\nscope of employment. But the parties still quarrel over the meaning of these verbs,\n\nwhich requires that we further interpret RCW 42.56.010(3). Statutory interpretation\n\nstarts with the plain meaning of the language; the plain meaning controls if it is\n\nunambiguous. Campbell, 146 Wn.2d at 11-12. We may use a dictionary to discern\n\nthe plain meaning of an undefined statutory term. HomeStreet, Inc. v. Dep 't of\n\nRevenue, 166 Wn.2d 444,451,210 P.3d 297 (2009) (citing Garrison v. Wash.

This interpretation is consistent with previous cases that treat\n\n\"preparing\" a record as creating it. See Dawson, 120 Wn.2d at 787 (agency prepared\n\nrecord by \"creat[ing] one ofthe files\"); Oliver, 94 Wn.2d at 566 (records of patient's\n\nhospitalization prepared by the hospital).\n\n      \"Owned.\" To \"own\" a record means \"to have or hold [it] as property.\"\n\nWEBSTER's, supra, at 1612; see also 0 'Neill v.

We broadly interpreted the term in Concerned Ratepayers Ass 'n v. Pub. Uti!.\n\nDist. No. 1 of Clark County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960,983 P.2d 635 (1999), holding that\n\nthe \"critical inquiry is whether the requested information bears a nexus with the\n\nagency's decision-making process.\" A record that is prepared and held by a third\n\nparty, without more, is not a public record. But if an agency \"evaluat[es], review[s],\n\nor refer[ s]\" to a record in the course of its business, the agency \"uses\" the record\n\nwithin the meaning of the PRA. Id. at 962.\n\n      \"Retained.\" To \"retain\" a record means \"to hold or continue to hold [it] in\n\npossession or use.\" WEBSTER'S, supra, at 1938.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nC. The Text Messages Are Potentially Public Records; the Call and Text Message\n                               Logs Are Not\n\n      We now apply those definitions to decide if the complaint sufficiently alleges\n\nthat the call logs and text messages are \"public records.\" Absent an allegation that\n\nthe County used the call and text message logs, the logs in this case are not public\n\nrecords. The call and text message logs were prepared and retained by Verizon, and\n\nNissen does not contend that the County evaluated, reviewed, or took any other\n\naction with the logs necessary to \"use\" them. Concerned Ratepayers, 138 Wn.2d at\n\n962. Though they evidence the acts of a public employee, the call and text message\n\nlogs played no role in County business as records themselves. We hold that the\n\ncomplaint fails to allege the call and text message logs are \"public records\" of the\n\nCounty within the meaning of RCW 42.56.010(3) because the County did nothing\n\nwith them.\n\n      We reach a different conclusion as to text messages. Nissen sufficiently\n\nalleges that Lindquist sent and received text messages in his official capacity \"to\n\ntake actions retaliating against her and other official misconduct.\" CP at 14. When\n\nacting within the scope of his employment, Lindquist prepares outgoing text\n\nmessages by \"putting them into written form\" and sending them. Similarly, he\n\n\"used\" incoming text messages when he reviewed and replied to them while within\n\nthe scope of employment. Since the County and Lindquist admit that some text\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nmessages might be \"work related,\" the complaint sufficiently alleges that those\n\nmessages meet all three elements of a \"public record\" under RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\n       Transcripts of the content of those text messages are thus potentially public\n\nrecords subject to disclosure, consistent with the procedure discussed below.\n\n                      III. SEARCHING FOR PUBLIC RECORDS WITHIN\n                                 AN EMPLOYEE'S CONTROL\n\n       We finally turn to the mechanics of searching for and obtaining public records\n\nstored by or in the control of an employee. The County and Lindquist suggest that\n\nvarious provisions of the state and federal constitutions categorically prohibit a\n\npublic employer from obtaining public records related to private cell phone use\n\nwithout consent. 9 Because an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in a\n\npublic record, 10 Lindquist's challenge is necessarily grounded in the constitutional\n\nrights he has in personal information comingled with those public records. We are\n\nmindful that today's mobile devices often contain \"a 'wealth of detail about [a\n\nperson's] familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\"'\n\nState v.

As noted earlier, many counties, cities, and agencies around the state\n\nrecognize the need to capture and retain public records created on personal devices.\n\nSome of those entities provide employees with a way to preserve public records and\n\navoid any inquiry into their private affairs by, for example, syncing work-related\n                                                I\n\n\ndocuments, e-mails, and text messages to an agency server or other place accessible\n\nto the employer. The County apparently has no such policy.\n\n      While a policy easing the burden on employees of preserving public records\n\nis certainly helpful, it cannot be a precondition to the public's right to access those\n\nrecords. If it were, the effectiveness of the PRA would hinge on \"the whim of the\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fNissen v.

The legislature\n\ntasks us with interpreting the PRA liberally and in light of the people's insistence\n\nthat they have information about the workings of the government they created. RCW\n\n42.56.030.   Of course, the public's statutory right to public records does not\n\nextinguish an individual's constitutional rights in private information. But we do\n\nnot read the PRA as a zero-sum choice between personal liberty and government\n\naccountability. Instead, we turn to well-settled principles of public disclosure law\n\nand hold that an employee's good-faith search for public records on his or her\n\npersonal device can satisfy an agency's obligations under the PRA.\n\n      Though technology evolves, segregating public records from nonpublic ones\n\nis nothing new for agencies responding to a PRA request. Whether stored in a file\n\ncabinet or a cell phone, the PRA has never authorized \"unbridled searches\" of every\n\npiece of information held by an agency or its employees to find records the citizen\n\nbelieves are responsive to a request.

To satisfy the agency's burden to show it conducted an\n\nadequate search for records, we permit employees in good faith to submit\n\n\"reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits\" attesting to the nature and extent of\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fNissen v.

We already incorporate FO IA' s standard for adequate searches into the PRA,\n\nNeigh. All., 172 Wn.2d at 720, and we similarly adopt FOIA's affidavit procedure\n\nfor an employee's personally held public records.\n\n      Therefore, we hold agency employees are responsible for searching their files,\n\ndevices, and accounts for records responsive to a relevant PRA request. Employees\n\nmust produce any public records (e-mails, text messages, and any other type of data)\n\nto the employer agency. The agency then proceeds just as it would when responding\n\nto a request for public records in the agency's possession by reviewing each record,\n\ndetermining if some or all of the record is exempted from production, and disclosing\n\nthe record to the requester. See generally Resident Action Council v. Seattle Hous.\n\nAuth., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436-37, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013).\n\n       Where an employee withholds personal records from the employer, he or she\n\nmust submit an affidavit with facts sufficient to show the information is not a \"public\n\nrecord\" under the PRA. So long as the affidavits give the requester and the trial\n\ncourt a sufficient factual basis to determine that withheld material is indeed\n\nnonresponsive, the agency has performed an adequate search under the PRA. When\n\ndone in good faith, this procedure allows an agency to fulfill its responsibility to\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nsearch for and disclose public records without unnecessarily treading on the\n\nconstitutional rights of its employees.\n\n      We recognize this procedure might be criticized as too easily abused or too\n\ndeferential to employees' judgment. Certainly the same can be said of any search\n\nfor public records, not just for records related to employee cell phone use. But we\n\noffer two specific responses. First, an employee's judgment would often be required\n\nto help identify public records on a cell phone, even in an in camera review. Text\n\nmessages, for example, are short communications whose meaning may not be self-\n\napparent.   Unlike a chain of e-mails where the preceding messages are often\n\nreplicated in the body of each new reply, text messages may contain only a few\n\nwords. The employee then might be needed to put that message into context to\n\ndetermine if it meets the statutory definition of a \"public record.\"\n\n       Second, those criticisms spotlight why agencies should develop ways to\n\ncapture public records related to employee cell phone use. The people enacted the\n\nPRA \"mindful ofthe right of individuals to privacy,\" LAWS OF 1973, ch. 1, Â§ 1(11),\n\nand individuals do not sacrifice all constitutional protection by accepting public\n\nemployment.

Agencies are in the best position to implement policies that fulfill\n\ntheir obligations under the PRA yet also preserve the privacy rights of their\n\nemployees. E-mails can be routed through agency servers, documents can be cached\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nto agency-controlled cloud services, and instant messagmg apps can store\n\nconversations. Agencies could provide employees with an agency-issued device that\n\nthe agency retains a right to access, or they could prohibit the use of personal devices\n\naltogether. That these may be more effective ways to address employee cell phone\n\nuse, however, does not diminish the PRA's directive that we liberally construe it\n\nhere to promote access to all public records. RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the Court of Appeals in part. Records that an agency employee\n\nprepares, owns, uses, or retains on a private cell phone within the scope of\n\nemployment can be \"public records\" of the agency under RCW 42.56.010(3).\n\nNissen's complaint thus sufficiently alleges that at least some of the text messages\n\nat issue may be public records subject to disclosure. Because it is impossible at this\n\nstage to determine if any messages are in fact public records, on remand the parties\n\nare directed as follows. Lindquist must obtain a transcript of the content of all the\n\ntext messages at issue, review them, and produce to the County any that are public\n\nrecords consistent with our opinion. The County must then review those messages-\n\njust as it would any other public record-and apply any applicable exemptions,\n\nredact information if necessary, and produce the records and any exemption log to\n\nNissen. As to text messages that Lindquist in good faith determines are not public\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fNissen v. Pierce County, No. 90875-3\n\nrecords, he must submit an affidavit to the County attesting to the personal character\n\nof those messages. The County must also produce that affidavit to Nissen.\n\n      We note that the County responded to Nissen's records requests and produced\n\nrecords in a timely manner based on what we presume was its good-faith\n\ninterpretation of the PRA. Though we now hold that interpretation is incorrect,\n\npenalties are not warranted at this early stage before the County has had the\n\nopportunity to comply with our opinion and supplement its response to Nissen's\n\nrequests accordingly. We reserve for the trial court the issue of penalties going\n\nforward.\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\fNissen v.
