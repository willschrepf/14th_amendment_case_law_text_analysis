Her employer of 20 years, the City of Aurora (the City),\n\nterminated plaintiff’s employment after she made a statement to a coworker in which she used\n\nthe word “idiots.” Plaintiff sued the City, alleging violations of the Illinois Human Rights Act\n\n(Human Rights Act) (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (West 2014)), including refusal to accommodate,\n\ndisparate treatment, retaliation, and hostile work environment. Following several interlocutory\n\ntrial court orders, the City petitioned for leave to appeal under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 308\n\n(eff. Feb. 26, 2010) (permissive interlocutory appeals), asking that we answer the following\n\ncertified questions:\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n                (1) Does section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act prohibit “disability\n\n       harassment” as a civil rights violation?         Alternatively, do counts I (refusal to\n\n       accommodate) and IV (hostile work environment) of plaintiff’s complaint state\n\n       cognizable civil rights violations under that section?\n\n                (2) If section 2-102(A) permits a cause of action for disability harassment, does\n\n       the provision in section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act “that an employer shall be\n\n       held responsible for sexual harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or\n\n       nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the\n\n       conduct and fails to take reasonable corrective measures” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West\n\n       2014)) similarly apply to a cause of action for disability harassment brought under\n\n       section 2-102(A)?     If yes, does the employee or the employer bear the burden of\n\n       alleging and proving that the employer: (a) is aware of the conduct by its nonmanagerial\n\n       and nonsupervisory employees; and (b) fails to take reasonable corrective measures?      If\n                                                                   1\n       no, can an employer assert the Faragher-Ellerth                 affirmative defense to a\n\n       hostile-work-environment harassment claim brought under section 2-102(A)?\n\n\n\n       1\n           With respect to claims brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n(Title VII) (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (2012)), where the harassing employee is a supervisor, but\n\nthe harassment does not result in tangible employment action, an employer may raise the\n\nFaragher-Ellerth affirmative defense that: (1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\n\nthe harassment; and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or\n\ncorrective opportunities the employer provided.      See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S.\n\n775, 807 (1998); Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n               (3) Does the Local Government and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act\n\n       (Tort Immunity Act) (745 ILCS 10/1-101 et seq. (West 2014)) apply to a civil action\n\n       under the Human Rights Act where the plaintiff seeks damages, reasonable attorney fees,\n\n       and costs?   If yes, should this court modify, reject, or overrule its holdings, in People ex.\n\n       rel. Birkett v. City of Chicago, 325 Ill. App. 3d 196, 202 (2001), Firestone v. Fritz, 119\n\n       Ill. App. 3d 685, 689 (1983), and Streeter v. County of Winnebago, 44 Ill. App. 3d 392,\n\n       394-95 (1976), that “the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does not bar\n\n       actions for constitutional violations” (Birkett, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 202)?\n\n¶2     We granted the petition, and, for the reasons set forth herein, we answer the certified\n\nquestions as follows: (1) section 2-102(A) of the Human                     Rights Act prohibits\n\nhostile-work-environment disability harassment, and a reasonable-accommodation claim may be\n\nbrought as a separate claim under that provision; (2) section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act\n\napplies to hostile-work-environment disability-harassment claims brought under section\n\n2-102(A), and the employee always bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in such a case; and\n\n(3) the Tort Immunity Act applies to actions under the Human Rights Act; the City thus can\n\nassert immunity with respect to plaintiff’s request for damages but not to her request for\n\nequitable relief; and we acknowledge that the supreme court has impliedly rejected our holdings\n\nthat the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does not apply to constitutional\n\nclaims and, thus, we do not follow that precedent.\n\n¶3                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4                                   A. Plaintiff’s Complaint\n\n¶5     Plaintiff sued the City on January 22, 2014. She had worked for the City from 1992 to\n\nJuly 13, 2012, most recently as a property maintenance compliance officer (reporting to Dave\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nDykstra and Mark Anderson). Plaintiff alleged that she had a medical history of unipolar\n\ndepression, anxiety, panic attacks, and partial hearing loss, which together constituted a\n\n“disability” under section 1-103(I) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1-103(I) (West 2014)).\n\nHer conditions did not prevent her from performing her job duties. However, when she was\n\nprovoked, she was particularly likely to react strongly, though never in a physical manner.\n\nPlaintiff would speak loudly or in a fast-paced manner, especially when provoked or agitated.\n\n¶6     Plaintiff further alleged that she notified the City of her medical conditions, asking it to\n\ntake them into consideration in her requests and attempts to maintain a reasonable and professional\n\nwork environment. The City “failed and refused to take any action.” According to plaintiff, her\n\ncoworkers engaged in an intentional pattern and practice to “agitate, embarrass, humiliate,\n\ndegrade, harass, discriminate and provoke” her, creating a hostile and offensive work\n\nenvironment. This conduct included name-calling (e.g., cuckoo, Shutter’s Island, prostitute,\n\nbitch, ignorant, nuts, crazy, weird, whacko), notes, spitting on her car window, and creating false\n\nrumors. Plaintiff alleged that this was a purposeful effort to cause her emotional distress and\n\nagitate her. She also alleged that certain staff and coworkers falsely claimed that plaintiff was a\n\nphysical threat even though she was not, and never had been, violent.\n\n¶7     Plaintiff alleged that she repeatedly complained to the City (specifically, to Dykstra and\n\nAnderson) and her union representative, but they “failed and refused to take any action” to stop the\n\nbehavior. As a result, plaintiff sustained further emotional harm and aggravation of her medical\n\nconditions. Also, the behavior impacted her ability to concentrate at work. She suffered from\n\ndepression, including fatigue, sadness, helplessness, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, sleep\n\ndisorders, and body aches.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶8      The City asked the union president to guarantee that plaintiff would not engage in physical\n\nviolence in the workplace and the union responded that plaintiff’s counselors and doctors did not\n\ndeem her to be a physical threat but that the union could never guarantee that anyone would never\n\ncommit an act of physical violence in the workplace.\n\n¶9      As of July 2012, a counselor had diagnosed plaintiff as being in the throes of depressive\n\nand panic disorders. On July 3, 2012, plaintiff made a statement to a coworker, using the word\n\n“idiots.” The City then terminated her employment. Plaintiff alleged that other employees had\n\nused far worse words and had not been disciplined. She argued that, if the City had taken\n\nreasonable steps to prevent the harassment, she would not have been in a vulnerable position.\n\nAlso, the City perceived plaintiff as being a risk or a threat to her coworkers and she was\n\ndiscriminated against based on this and her medical history.\n\n¶ 10    Plaintiff’s four-count complaint alleged: (1) refusal to accommodate; (2) disparate\n\ntreatment; (3) retaliation; and (4) hostile work environment. She sought back pay, front pay, the\n\nvalue of lost benefits, compensatory damages, reinstatement with full seniority, attorney fees, and\n\nthe costs of her suit. 2\n\n¶ 11    In answers to interrogatories, plaintiff responded that she never filed a harassment\n\ncomplaint pursuant to the City’s anti-harassment policy 3 or initiated with the City’s human\n\n        2\n            Plaintiff first filed her discrimination charge with the Department of Human Rights\n\n(Department). Because the Department did not complete its investigation of her case within 365\n\ndays from the date she filed her charge, it issued a notice authorizing plaintiff to file a civil action\n\nin the appropriate circuit court as of November 18, 2013. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(G) (West 2014).\n        3\n            The policy provides that: “If an employee feels that he/she has experienced or witnessed\n\nharassment, the employee is to immediately report the act of harassment to his/her Immediate\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nresources department a request for a reasonable accommodation under the City’s\n\nreasonable-accommodations policy. 4        However, she stated that she made numerous oral\n\ncomplaints to the City about the harassment.             In count I, she alleged that she reasonably\n\ncommunicated to the City that she was seeking an accommodation due to her medical conditions\n\nand that she made repeated requests to management to take action to stop the harassing and\n\ndemeaning conduct. According to plaintiff, she and her union representative were told that\n\nplaintiff had to “live with it,” “deal with it,” and “ignore it.” They were also told, “I don’t think\n\nthat’s harassment” and “do what you gotta do.”\n\n¶ 12                     B. The City’s Answer and Affirmative Defenses\n\n¶ 13   The City admitted that, prior to July 2012, it had received documentation that reflected\n\nthat plaintiff had been diagnosed with unipolar depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and partial\n\nhearing loss.   However, it denied most of plaintiff’s allegations, including that her medical\n\nconditions constituted a disability or that they caused her difficulty at work.\n\n¶ 14   The City also raised several affirmative defenses: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\n(all counts); (2) the existence of a policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation\n\nSupervisor, Division Director, Department Head, Corporation Counsel or Director of Human\n\nResources.” The policy does not specify that the report must be in writing.\n       4\n           That policy provides that, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n(ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (2012)), an “employee with a known disability shall request an\n\naccommodation from his immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor, in concert with the\n\nDepartment Head and the Reasonable Accommodation Committee, shall determine if the\n\naccommodation is reasonable and provide the accommodation as provided herein.” The policy\n\ndoes not specify that the request be in writing.\n\n\n\n                                                   -6-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\non the basis of disability (per its collective bargaining agreement with the union and its employee\n\nhandbook) and plaintiff’s failure to pursue corrective opportunities thereunder, to request an\n\naccommodation, or to report any harassment; and the lack of any harassment by any supervisory\n\nor managerial employee, and the City’s lack of knowledge about any harassment by\n\nnonsupervisory, nonmanagerial coworkers (counts I and IV); (3) supervisory immunity under\n\nsection 3-108 of the Tort Immunity Act (745 ILCS 10/3-108 (West 2014)) (counts I and IV); (4)\n\ndiscretionary immunity under section 2-201 of the Tort Immunity Act (745 ILCS 10/2-201 (West\n\n2014)) (counts I and IV); (5) plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the adoption of, or failure to\n\nadopt, an enactment under section 2-103 of the Tort Immunity Act (745 ILCS 10/2-103 (West\n\n2014)) (all counts); and (6) preemption by the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act (820 ILCS\n\n305/5(a) (West 2014) (counts I and IV).    The City asked that the court strike and/or dismiss the\n\ncounts in plaintiff’s complaint.\n\n¶ 15                                  B. Trial Court Orders\n\n¶ 16   On October 17, 2014, the trial court struck and dismissed counts I and IV of plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint, finding that disability harassment (as opposed to disability discrimination) was not a\n\ncivil rights violation under the Human Rights Act.     On January 23, 2015, however, the court\n\ngranted plaintiff’s motion to reconsider, reinstated counts I and IV, and gave the City leave to\n\nfile amended affirmative defenses.    On April 22, 2015, the trial court denied plaintiff’s motion\n\nto strike the City’s first and second affirmative defenses (subject matter jurisdiction and\n\nexistence of employer policy), but granted the motion to strike the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth\n\naffirmative defenses (raising the tort immunity and workers’ compensation statutes).\n\n¶ 17   On April 29, 2015, the court entered an order finding that its aforementioned\n\ninterlocutory orders involved questions of law as to which there were substantial grounds for\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\ndifference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from said orders may materially advance the\n\nultimate termination of the litigation.    Ill. S. Ct. R. 308 (eff. Jan. 1, 2015).   It certified the\n\nquestions noted above.\n\n¶ 18    On June 23, 2015, we granted the City’s petition for leave to appeal. 5\n\n¶ 19                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 20                                    A. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 21    An interlocutory appeal pursuant to Rule 308 is ordinarily limited to the question\n\ncertified by the trial court, which, because it must be a question of law, is reviewed de novo.\n\nThompson v. Gordon, 221 Ill. 2d 414, 426 (2006).          Similarly, we review de novo statutory\n\nconstruction issues (Boaden v. Department of Law Enforcement, 171 Ill. 2d 230, 237 (1996)),\n\nand the question whether a pleading is substantially insufficient in law (Powell v. American\n\nService Insurance Co., 2014 IL App (1st) 123643, ¶ 13).\n\n¶ 22                           B. Principles of Statutory Construction\n\n¶ 23    Our primary objective in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the\n\nlegislature’s intent. MidAmerica Bank, FSB v. Charter One Bank, FSB, 232 Ill. 2d 560, 565\n\n(2009). The plain language of a statute is the most reliable indication of legislative intent.\n\nDeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006).      “[W]hen the language of the statute is clear, it\n\nmust be applied as written without resort to aids or tools of interpretation.” Id.      The statute\n\nshould be read as a whole and construed “so that no term is rendered superfluous or\n\nmeaningless.” In re Marriage of Kates, 198 Ill. 2d 156, 163 (2001).         We do not depart from\n\nthe plain language of a statute by reading into it exceptions, limitations, or conditions that\n\n        5\n            Further, we subsequently granted the Department’s motion for leave to file an amicus\n\ncuriae brief in support of plaintiff.\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nconflict with the legislative intent. Harrisonville Telephone Co. v. Illinois Commerce Comm’n,\n\n212 Ill. 2d 237, 251 (2004).\n\n¶ 24   If the words used in a statute are ambiguous or if the meaning is unclear, a court may\n\nconsider the legislative history as an aid to construction. Armstrong v. Hedlund Corp., 316 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 1097, 1106 (2000).       A statute is ambiguous if it is capable of two reasonable and\n\nconflicting interpretations.   Tri-State Coach Lines, Inc. v. Metropolitan Pier & Exposition\n\nAuthority, 315 Ill. App. 3d 179, 190 (2000).       Our supreme court has instructed that, “[i]f the\n\nlanguage of a statute is susceptible to two constructions, one of which will carry out its purpose\n\nand another which will defeat it, the statute will receive the former construction.” Harvel v.\n\nCity of Johnston City, 146 Ill. 2d 277, 284 (1992).      A court should not construe a statute in a\n\nmanner that would lead to consequences that are absurd, inconvenient, or unjust. McMahan v.\n\nIndustrial Comm’n, 183 Ill. 2d 499, 513-14 (1998).              Further, a court should avoid an\n\ninterpretation of a statute that would render any portion of it meaningless or void. McNamee v.\n\nFederated Equipment & Supply Co., 181 Ill. 2d 415, 422 (1998).\n\n¶ 25                             C. Human Rights Act Framework\n\n¶ 26   The Human Rights Act expressly implements the guarantees provided by article I,\n\nsections 17, 18, and 19, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, §§ 17, 18, 19).   775\n\nILCS 5/1-102(F) (West 2014). The statute provides a comprehensive scheme to “secure for all\n\nindividuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination against any individual because of his\n\nor her race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, marital\n\nstatus, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or\n\nunfavorable discharge from military service in connection with employment, real estate\n\ntransactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.”\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n(Emphases added.) 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) (West 2014).             The Human Rights Act is remedial\n\nlegislation.   Arlington Park Race Track Corp. v. Human Rights Comm’n, 199 Ill. App. 3d 698,\n\n703 (1990).    Accordingly, we liberally construe it to effectuate its purposes.   Id.\n\n¶ 27    Sections 2-102 and 6-101 of the Human Rights Act set forth what constitute civil rights\n\nviolations in employment.     Section 2-102(A) provides that it is a civil rights violation “[f]or any\n\nemployer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with respect to recruitment, hiring, promotion,\n\nrenewal of employment, selection for training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure or\n\nterms, privileges or conditions of employment on the basis of unlawful discrimination or\n\ncitizenship status.” (Emphases added.) 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2014). Other subsections\n\nof section 2-102 prohibit: employers’ restrictions on use of a language in communications\n\nunrelated to the employee’s duties (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A-5) (West 2014)), employment agency\n\ndiscrimination (775 ILCS 5/2-102(B) (West 2014)), labor organization discrimination (775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(C) (West 2014)), sexual harassment by various entities/persons, including employers\n\nand employees (775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014)), public employers’ restrictions on\n\nemployees’ practice of their religious beliefs (775 ILCS 5/2-102(E) (West 2014)), age\n\ndiscrimination by employers or labor organizations with respect to selection for or conduct of\n\napprenticeship    or   training   programs   (775    ILCS    5/2-102(F)    (West    2014));   certain\n\nimmigration-related practices (775 ILCS 5/2-102(G) (West 2014)); pregnancy discrimination\n\nand refusals of pregnancy-related requests for reasonable accommodations (775 ILCS 5/2-102(I),\n\n(J) (West 2014)); and the failure to post notices concerning employees’ rights under the statute\n\n(775 ILCS 5/2-102(K) (West 2014)). The statute also prohibits retaliation against a person\n\nbecause he or she has opposed, inter alia, unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment, because\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nhe or she has filed a charge, or because he or she has requested a reasonable accommodation.\n\n775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 28     “Unlawful discrimination” is defined as “discrimination against a person because of his\n\nor her race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, order of protection\n\nstatus, disability, military status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or unfavorable discharge from\n\nmilitary service as those terms are defined in this Section.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS\n\n5/1-103(Q) (West 2014).      “Disability,” in turn, is defined, in part, as “a determinable physical\n\nor mental characteristic of a person *** which may result from disease, injury, congenital\n\ncondition of birth or functional disorder” and “is unrelated to the person’s ability to perform the\n\nduties of a particular job or position.” 775 ILCS 5/1-103(I)(1) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 29     The term “harassment” explicitly appears in the Human Rights Act in the employment\n\ncontext only with respect to “sexual harassment,” which is defined as “any unwelcome sexual\n\nadvances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when (1) submission to\n\nsuch conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s\n\nemployment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis\n\nfor employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect\n\nof substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,\n\nhostile or offensive working environment.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS 5/2-101(E) (West\n\n2014).    Similarly, the term “hostile or offensive working environment” explicitly appears only\n\nin this context.   The Human Rights Act explicitly prohibits sexual harassment.       It provides that\n\nit is a civil rights violation “[f]or any employer, employee, agent of any employer, employment\n\nagency or labor organization to engage in sexual harassment; provided, that an employer shall be\n\nresponsible for sexual harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nnonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the\n\nconduct and fails to take reasonable corrective measures.” 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014);\n\nsee also Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department v. Human Rights Comm’n, 233 Ill. 2d 125,\n\n138-41 (2009) (employers are strictly liable for sexual harassment by supervisory employees,\n\neven where the supervisory worker has no authority to affect the terms and conditions of the\n\ncomplaining employee’s employment and regardless of whether the employer was aware of the\n\nharassment or took measures to correct it).\n\n¶ 30                                D. First Certified Question\n\n¶ 31   The first certified question asks: “Does section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act\n\nprohibit ‘disability harassment’ as a civil rights violation?   Alternatively, do counts I and IV of\n\nplaintiff’s complaint state cognizable civil rights violations under that section?” For clarity and\n\nto more accurately reflect the parties’ arguments, we address whether the following claims are\n\ncognizable under the statute: (1) hostile-work-environment disability harassment (count IV); and\n\n(2) refusal to provide reasonable accommodation (count I).\n\n¶ 32                  (1) Hostile-Work-Environment Disability Harassment\n\n¶ 33   In count IV, plaintiff alleged that the City violated her civil rights by failing to take\n\nactions to stop the harassment/hostile work environment based upon her disability. This claim\n\nrelies on section 2-102(A).\n\n¶ 34   As noted above, although the Human Rights Act explicitly references disability\n\ndiscrimination (in section 2-102(A)), it does not, with respect to employment, explicitly refer to\n\ndisability harassment.     Rather, it explicitly makes only sexual harassment a civil rights\n\nviolation.   775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014); see also 775 ILCS 5/5A-102 (West 2014)\n\n(prohibiting sexual harassment in education, but not referring to disability harassment in that\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\ncontext). 6    Also, in the statute’s declaration of policy, the General Assembly explicitly\n\nrecognized the public policies to secure freedom from unlawful discrimination (in section\n\n1-102(A)) and, separately, freedom from sexual harassment in employment and education (in\n\nsection 1-102(B)). 7\n\n¶ 35    The City contends that the Human Rights Act unambiguously reflects that discrimination\n\nand (only sexual) harassment are separate and distinct civil rights violations.   It further asserts\n\nthat, had the General Assembly intended to prohibit a hostile work environment based on\n\ndisability (i.e., disability harassment), it would have done so by making disability harassment a\n\nseparate civil rights violation, just as it did for sexual harassment.    (In 1983, the General\n\nAssembly amended the Human Rights Act to add a provision addressing “sexual harassment”\n\nunder sections 2-102(D) (in employment) and 5A-102(A) (in education).        Pub. Act 83-89 (eff.\n\nJan. 1, 1984 (amending section 2-102); Pub. Act 83-91 (eff. Jan. 1, 1984) (amending section\n\n        6\n            However, by rule, the Department and the Human Rights Commission (Commission)\n\nhave proscribed national-origin harassment. 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900 (1986).\n        7\n            In the same provision, the legislature also listed as public policies: freedom from\n\nemployment discrimination based on citizenship status (775 ILCS 5/1-102(C) (West 2014));\n\nfreedom from discrimination based on familial status in real estate transactions (775 ILCS\n\n5/1-102(D) (West 2014)); public health, welfare, and safety (775 ILCS 5/1-102(E) (West 2014));\n\nimplementation of the aforementioned constitutional guarantees (775 ILCS 5/1-102(F) (West\n\n2014)); equal opportunity and affirmative action by the State (775 ILCS 5/1-102(G) (West 2014));\n\nand freedom from unfounded charges of discrimination, sexual harassment in employment or\n\neducation, and employment discrimination based on citizenship status (775 ILCS 5/1-102(H)\n\n(West 2014)).\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n5A-102).) Alternatively, the City contends that the General Assembly could have amended\n\nsection 2-102(A) to expressly clarify that unlawful discrimination includes harassment/hostile\n\nwork environment, but it did not do so.\n\n¶ 36   Pointing to foreign authority, the City contends that there is a well-recognized distinction\n\nbetween discrimination and harassment.     See Roby v. McKesson Corp., 219 P.3d 749, 762 (Cal.\n\n2009) (noting the distinction in California’s civil rights statute; discrimination involves explicit\n\nchanges in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment—changes involving official action\n\ntaken by the employer; harassment, in contrast, focuses on situations where the workplace’s\n\nsocial environment becomes intolerable because the harassment communicates an offensive\n\nmessage to the harassed employee).\n\n¶ 37   Plaintiff and the Department respond that a disability harassment claim is legally\n\ncognizable as a civil rights violation under the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment”\n\nprong of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act.      In support, they point to: (1) case law that\n\nrecognized harassment/hostile work environment claims before the enactment of section\n\n2-102(D); (2) Commission interpretations; and (3) longstanding case law addressing racial\n\nharassment claims (which they note would not constitute viable civil rights violations if the\n\nCity’s argument were correct).\n\n¶ 38   We turn first to the cases upon which plaintiff and the Department rely.         In Old Ben\n\nCoal Co. v. Human Rights Comm’n, 150 Ill. App. 3d 304, 309 (1987), the Fifth District held that,\n\neven before the 1983 amendment that added section 2-102(D) to the Human Rights Act, the\n\nstatute prohibited sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.     It noted that, although a\n\nstatutory amendment creates a presumption that the legislature intended to change the law, the\n\npresumption may be rebutted by demonstrating that the amendment reflects the legislature’s\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nintent to clarify the law as it previously existed. Id. at 306.   After concluding that the statute\n\nwas subject to differing interpretations, the court determined that the presumption was rebutted\n\nbecause: (1) the legislative history reflected that both proponents and opponents of the\n\namendment considered sexual harassment to be a form of sex discrimination and that an\n\namendment was necessary to clarify the prohibition; (2) federal decisions interpreting Title VII,\n\nalthough considering a statute that did not contain a separate amendment specifically addressing\n\nsexual harassment, did “not dissuade” the court from finding support therein in the cases’\n\nrationale that “terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” is an expansive concept that\n\nincludes sexual harassment; (3) the Commission’s interpretation of the statute, under which it\n\nconsidered sexual harassment allegations prior to the amendment, should be accorded\n\nsignificance; and (4) the interpretation of sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination with\n\nrespect to the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West\n\n2014)) was consistent with the Human Rights Act’s purpose to secure freedom from sex\n\ndiscrimination in connection with employment. Old Ben Coal, 150 Ill. App. 3d 304 at 308-09;\n\nsee also Board of Directors, Green Hills Country Club v. Human Rights Comm’n, 162 Ill. App.\n\n3d 216, 221 (1987) (Fifth District, relying on Old Ben Coal, further held that, prior to effective\n\ndate of section 2-102(D), employers were strictly liable for sexual harassment by supervisory\n\npersonnel regardless of whether they knew of such conduct).\n\n¶ 39   Similarly, in Village of Bellwood Board of Fire & Police Commissioners v. Human\n\nRights Comm’n, 184 Ill. App. 3d 339, 351 (1989), the First District upheld the Commission’s\n\ndetermination that a racially charged atmosphere in a police department “amounted to racial\n\nharassment, and thus, constituted discrimination based on race within the meaning of the\n\n[Human Rights Act].”       (Racial harassment, like disability harassment, is not explicitly\n\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\naddressed in the statute.)   Noting that the former employee had been continuously subjected to\n\nracially derogatory comments and that his supervisors were aware of the problem but did nothing\n\nto correct it, the court noted that “this is exactly the type of racial harassment which the [Human\n\nRights Act] seeks to prevent.” Id. at 350-51 (further noting that racial harassment involves\n\nmore than a few isolated incidents of harassment; it must be severe and pervasive 8); see also ISS\n\nInternational Service System, Inc. v. Human Rights Comm’n, 272 Ill. App. 3d 969, 975 (1995)\n\n(assessing national origin harassment allegations as discrimination claim under section\n\n2-102(A)); Hautpave, Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n Rep. 1980SF0097 (Jan. 6, 1984) (assessing racial\n\ndiscrimination in the form of racial harassment); Korshak, Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n Rep.\n\n\n\n       8\n           Likewise, to create a hostile work environment, the misconduct “must be sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive ‘to alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an abusive\n\nwork environment.’ ” Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) (quoting\n\nHenson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 1982)). The work environment “must be\n\nhostile or abusive to a reasonable person and the individual alleging sexual harassment must have\n\nactually perceived the environment to be hostile or abusive.” Trayling v. Board of Fire & Police\n\nCommissioners of the Village of Bensenville, 273 Ill. App. 3d 1, 12 (1995) (sexual harassment\n\ncase). A court examines all of the circumstances in determining whether an environment is\n\nhostile or abusive, including factors such as the “ ‘frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its\n\nseverity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and\n\nwhether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.’ ” Crittenden v. Cook\n\nCounty Comm’n on Human Rights, 2012 IL App (1st) 112437, ¶ 55 (quoting Harris v. Forklift\n\nSystems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)).\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n1980CF1267 (June 11, 1982) (religious harassment constitutes discrimination on basis of\n\nreligion).\n\n¶ 40    In response, the City contends that Old Ben Coal was overruled sub silentio by two\n\nsubsequent supreme court decisions: Board of Trustees of Southern Illinois University v.\n\nDepartment of Human Rights, 159 Ill. 2d 206, 213 (1994) (assessing whether an academic\n\nprogram at a public institution of higher learning constitutes a public place of accommodation\n\nsuch that Commission had jurisdiction to hear discrimination complaint, and holding that it did\n\nnot; court noted that its conclusion was bolstered by the 1983 enactment of section 5A-102,\n\nwhich conferred on the Department jurisdiction over sexual harassment in higher education;\n\naddition of article 5A reflected the legislature’s understanding that, until its passage, Department\n\nhad no jurisdiction over institutions of higher education; thus, since 1983, Department had\n\njurisdiction over higher education, but only as to a “very distinct” type of claim: sexual\n\nharassment), and Sangamon County, 233 Ill. 2d at 138-41 (based on its finding that statute was\n\nunambiguous and consideration of the public policy reasons supporting employer liability,\n\nholding that an employer is strictly liable under section 2-102(D) for hostile-environment sexual\n\nharassment by its supervisory employee, even where that employee has no authority to affect the\n\nterms and conditions of the complaining employee’s employment and regardless of whether the\n\nemployer was aware of the harassment or took measures to correct it; rejecting suggestion to\n\nlook to federal case law, which uses a narrow definition of a supervisor).      However, we find\n\nthese cases inopposite. Board of Trustees addressed the Department’s jurisdiction to hear racial\n\ndiscrimination claims against a public university and whether a public university was subject to\n\nthe statute.   The court, in dicta, stated that its conclusion that academic programs were not\n\n“accommodations” under the statute was “bolstered” by the 1983 amendment that specifically\n\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nconferred on the Department jurisdiction over claims of sexual harassment in higher education,\n\nbut the court did not address whether sexual harassment was a civil rights violation before the\n\namendment.       Board of Trustees, 159 Ill. 2d at 213.   As the Department notes, the question in\n\nBoard of Trustees was who was subject to the Human Rights Act, not what was prohibited by it.\n\nFurther, the question whether racial harassment claims were cognizable under the statute was not\n\nbefore the court.    Similarly, Sangamon County provides no guidance here because it did not\n\naddress the issue in this case; it involved discrimination by a supervisory employee, which is not\n\nat issue here.   Sangamon County, 233 Ill. 2d at 138-41.\n\n¶ 41    The City contends that, unlike Title VII, which does not expressly distinguish between\n\nharassment and discrimination, the General Assembly’s 1983 amendment reflects its intent to\n\ncreate a separate and distinct cause of action only for sexual harassment and to expand the scope\n\nof an employer’s liability for a supervisor’s harassment by imposing strict liability for any\n\nsupervisory sexual harassment, without regard to whether it culminates in tangible employment\n\naction or the supervisor has authority over the victim’s terms, privileges, or conditions of\n\nemployment.      The City also urges that the decision to expand beyond sexual harassment the\n\nHuman Rights Act’s protection against harassment in the workplace rests with the legislative\n\nbranch, not the judicial branch.\n\n¶ 42    We reject the City’s arguments. We find the statute ambiguous.       The ambiguity stems\n\nfrom the statute’s prohibition in section 2-102(A) of unlawful discrimination with respect to the\n\nterms, privileges, or conditions of employment, which can reasonably be read to include\n\nharassment on the basis of an enumerated characteristic.       Indeed, in Old Ben Coal, the Fifth\n\nDistrict held as much with respect to sexual harassment prior to the legislature’s enactment of\n\nsection 2-102(D).     Old Ben Coal, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 309.   Also, the statute does not explicitly\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nstate that sexual harassment is the only type of harassment that constitutes a civil rights violation.\n\nHowever, another reading of the Human Rights Act is that the enactment of section 2-102(D)\n\neffectuated a change of existing law to add sexual harassment as an additional civil rights\n\nviolation, to the (implicit) exclusion of other types of harassment.\n\n¶ 43   Having determined that the statute is ambiguous, we turn to statutory-construction aids.\n\nIn our view, they support an expansive reading of section 2-102(A), such as the approach taken\n\nin Old Ben Coal, and lead to the conclusion that disability harassment is a cognizable civil rights\n\nviolation under section 2-102(A).\n\n¶ 44   First, we consider the Human Rights Act’s purposes.         One of them is to “secure for all\n\nindividuals *** the freedom from discrimination against any individual because of his or her ***\n\nphysical or mental disability *** in connection with employment.”             775 ILCS 5/1-102(A)\n\n(West 2014).    It also implements several constitutional guarantees, including section 19 of\n\narticle I, which provides: “All persons with a physical or mental handicap *** shall be free from\n\ndiscrimination unrelated to ability in the hiring and promotion practices of an employer” (Ill.\n\nConst. 1970, art. I, § 19).   775 ILCS 5/2-102(F) (West 2014).         Reading section 2-102(A) to\n\nprohibit disability harassment undoubtedly comports with these purposes.\n\n¶ 45   Turning to a second statutory-construction aid, the type of legislation, we note that the\n\nHuman Rights Act constitutes remedial legislation, which is liberally construed to effectuate its\n\npurposes.   Arlington Park Race Track, 199 Ill. App. 3d at 703.        Broadly construing the phrase\n\n“terms, privileges or conditions of employment” in section 2-102(A) to prohibit a hostile work\n\nenvironment based on disability is clearly consistent with the statute’s purpose to effectuate the\n\nright of every disabled person to be free from workplace discrimination.         We find additional\n\nsupport for this conclusion in the fact that the Commission, which, jointly with the Department,\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nis the agency charged with enforcing the Human Rights Act (Boaden v. Department of Law\n\nEnforcement, 171 Ill. 2d 230, 261 (1996)), has defined harassment “as any form of behavior\n\nwhich makes a working environment so hostile and abusive that it constitutes a different term\n\nand condition of employment based on a discriminatory factor.” Hines, Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n\n\nRep. 1988CN0644, at *3 (May 28, 1996) (finding that the employee established verbal\n\nharassment on the basis of race).    The Commission has also noted in its decisions that, though\n\nthere is no case law on the issue of disability harassment, “there is no logical reason why the\n\n[Human Rights] Act should tolerate workplace harassment based on a handicap when it does not\n\ntolerate harassment based on any other protected classification.            [Citation.]   Therefore,\n\nComplainant’s handicap harassment claims should be analyzed in the same manner as the racial\n\nand gender harassment claims.” Gonzalez, Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n Rep. 2006CF2012, at *8\n\n(Aug. 23, 2010); see also 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900 (1986) (proscribing national origin\n\nharassment). We place significant weight on these interpretations.          See Wanless v. Human\n\nRights Comm’n, 296 Ill. App. 3d 401, 403 (1998) (Commission’s interpretation of the Human\n\nRights Act is “accorded substantial weight and deference” by reviewing courts because its\n\ninterpretation “flows directly from its expertise and experience with the statute that it administers\n\nand enforces”).\n\n¶ 46   Furthermore, we note that federal law, which we routinely consult and rely upon in this\n\narea (see Valley Mould & Iron Co. v. Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, 133 Ill. App. 3d 273, 279\n\n(1985)), has been interpreted in a similar fashion.     In Meritor Savings Bank, 477 U.S. at 66, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the creation of a hostile work environment through harassment is a\n\nform of proscribed discrimination under Title VII.          The Court determined that the phrase\n\n“terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,” which appears in both Title VII and the\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nHuman Rights Act, reflects a legislative intent to encompass the full spectrum of discriminatory\n\ntreatment in employment. Id. at 64.       It also noted that EEOC guidelines, which it found\n\ninstructive, defined sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.     Id. at 65.   The Court\n\nfurther noted that the guidelines had drawn on case law that held that Title VII\n\nhostile-work-environment claims could be brought in the contexts of race, religion, and national\n\norigin; thus, reading the statute to proscribe a hostile environment based on discriminatory sexual\n\nharassment was consistent with the case law.    Id. at 66. 9\n\n¶ 47   We reject the City’s argument that Title VII case law is unhelpful because that statute\n\ndoes not explicitly and separately address sexual harassment, as the Human Rights Act does.\n\nThis argument is unavailing because the Title VII case law interprets the phrase “terms,\n\n       9\n           Title VII does not address disability; however, the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n\n1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (2012)) does by prohibiting certain employers from\n\ndiscriminating against individuals on the basis of their disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (2012).\n\nThat statute also contains the phrase “terms, conditions, and privileges of employment” (42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12112(a) (2012)).         Several federal circuit courts of appeals expressly recognize\n\nhostile-work-environment claims for disability harassment. Lanman v. Johnson County, Kansas,\n\n393 F.3d 1151, 1155 (10th Cir. 2004); Shaver v. Independent Stave Co., 350 F.3d 716, 719 (8th\n\nCir. 2003); Flowers v. Southern Regional Physician Services Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 233 (5th Cir.\n\n2001); Fox v. General Motors Corp., 247 F.3d 169, 176 (4th Cir. 2001). Several other federal\n\nreviewing courts have assumed that such a cause of action is authorized by the ADA, without\n\ndeciding the issue. See, e.g., Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc., 434 F.3d 75, 89 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); Silk v. City of Chicago, 194 F.3d 788, 803-04 (7th Cir. 1999); Walton v. Mental Health\n\nAss’n of Southeastern Pennsylvania, 168 F.3d 661, 666-67 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nprivileges or conditions of employment,” which, again, is also contained in section 2-102(A) of\n\nthe Human Rights Act.\n\n¶ 48   The third statutory-construction aid we turn to is legislative history.      The legislative\n\nhistory of section 2-102(D) reflects that the provision was added to the statute to clarify existing\n\npractices and to narrowly expand the available protections (the latter with respect to same-sex\n\nharassment and male victims, which are not alleged here).      It clearly did not effect a change in\n\nthe law by creating a new cause of action.    See Old Ben Coal, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 307 (coming\n\nto the same conclusion: “both proponents and opponents of the amendment considered sexual\n\nharassment to be prohibited by the *** Human Rights Act as a form of sex discrimination and\n\nthat the amendment was needed only to clarify this proscription” (emphasis added)).         During\n\nthe House debates, the sponsor, Representative Currie, responded as follows to the question\n\nwhether sexual harassment cases had “currently” been considered sex discrimination cases by\n\nthe Department and the Commission:\n\n       “Presently, the [Department] understands that it may interpret its authority to deal with\n\n       sex discrimination to include instances of sex harassment.      The [Department] supports\n\n       this Bill, as does the Commission, on the grounds that there is some ambiguity in that\n\n       decision.   It’s based on council’s opinion.     Councils can change.    Only through that\n\n       opinion is the Department able to establish rules and regulations. It would become much\n\n       clearer if we were to establish this program in the state statutes themselves.   In addition,\n\n       same sex harassment or harassment when the victim is a male can clearly not be covered\n\n       under an interpretation of sex discrimination prohibition which the Department presently\n\n       uses for these cases.”    (Emphasis added.) 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings,\n\n       Mar. 23, 1983, at 55 (statements of Representative Currie).\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nLater in the proceedings, she stated that the Department took the position that passage of the\n\namendment would “clarify and specify its authority.”            (Emphasis added.)      Id. at 56.\n\nFurthermore, Representative Mays, an opponent, related a conversation with a Department\n\nrepresentative who was asked if a case had ever come before the Commission that the\n\nDepartment refused to handle; Mays related that the Department responded to that in the\n\nnegative but that the Department surmised that, as to an employer who harassed both male and\n\nfemale employees, a claim could not be brought as discrimination.           Id. at 56-57.   These\n\nexcerpts reflect that the enactment of section 2-102(D) was a clarification of the law with respect\n\nto the issue before us.\n\n¶ 49   The City points to the legislative history of article 5A of the Human Rights Act, which\n\naddresses elementary, secondary, and higher education.      During the House debates on section\n\n5A-102, which prohibits sexual harassment in education, Representative Koehler stated:\n\n       “[This amendment] amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to include sexual harassment\n\n       in higher education as a civil rights violation.         Under the Human Rights Act,\n\n       discrimination on the basis of sex already constitutes a civil rights violation. However,\n\n       it is important to point out that there is a distinct difference between sex discrimination,\n\n       which deals with prejudice[,] and sexual harassment, which deals with a hostile\n\n       environment and repeated torment.” 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 5,\n\n       1983, at 33-34 (statements of Representative Koehler).\n\nAlthough the statement appears to somewhat conflict with the legislative history of section\n\n2-102(D), we do not place much weight on it, because it addresses a different section of the\n\nstatute than the one at issue here and does not specifically address whether harassment claims\n\nwere already being heard under article 5A, as sexual-harassment employment claims were.\n\n\n\n                                              - 23 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 50   In summary, we conclude that the presumption that the 1983 amendment changed the law\n\nhas been rebutted.     We further hold that section 2-102(A) prohibits disability harassment.\n\nAccordingly, we answer the first part of the first certified question in the affirmative.\n\n¶ 51                              (2) Reasonable Accommodation\n\n¶ 52   In count I, plaintiff alleged that the City violated her civil rights by failing to provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation for her disability after she asked it to take appropriate action to stop\n\nher nonsupervisory coworkers’ harassment. This part of the first certified question asks if such\n\na claim is cognizable under section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act.          The City argues that:\n\n(1) the Human Rights Act does not expressly impose such a duty on employers and should not be\n\nread to do so; and (2) a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation should be part of a prima\n\nfacie case for unlawful disability discrimination, not a separate and distinct civil rights violation.\n\nFor the following reasons, we conclude that a reasonable-accommodation claim is cognizable as\n\na separate claim under section 2-102(A).\n\n¶ 53   Preliminarily, we note again that the Human Rights Act is a remedial statute that is\n\nliberally construed to effectuate its purposes.    Arlington Park Race Track, 199 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n703.   Also, “[a]n agency may adopt a rule and regulate an activity only insomuch as a statute\n\nempowers the agency to do so. [Citation.]         An administrative rule unauthorized by statute is\n\ninvalid, and we must strike it down.”         Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. Illinois Commerce\n\nComm’n, 362 Ill. App. 3d 652, 656 (2005); see 775 ILCS 5/8-102(E) (West 2014).              Where the\n\nlegislature has charged an agency with administering and enforcing a statute, we “ ‘give\n\nsubstantial weight and deference’ ” to its resolution of any ambiguities in the statute.      Illinois\n\nBell Telephone Co., 362 Ill. App. 3d at 656 (quoting Illinois Consolidated Telephone Co. v.\n\nIllinois Commerce Comm’n, 95 Ill. 2d 142, 152 (1983)).            This is so because the agency’s\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\ninterpretation “flows directly from its expertise and experience with the statute that it administers\n\nand enforces.”     Wanless, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 403.    Where a statute is ambiguous, “the court\n\ndoes not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence\n\nof an administrative interpretation.    Rather, *** the question for the court is whether the\n\nagency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).              “A court will not\n\nsubstitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation adopted by\n\nthe agency charged with the statute’s administration.” Church v. State, 164 Ill. 2d 153, 162\n\n(1995).\n\n¶ 54                     (i) Duty to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation\n\n¶ 55      The duty to reasonably accommodate disabled employees is explicitly imposed only by\n\nadministrative regulation.   By joint rule, the Commission and the Department require that\n\nemployers provide reasonable accommodations for “known physical or mental limitations of\n\notherwise qualified disabled applicants or employees,” unless the accommodations are\n\nprohibitively expensive or would unduly disrupt ordinary business conduct.       56 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n2500.40(a) (2009).     The employee seeking an accommodation has the burden to apprise the\n\nemployer of his or her condition and submit any necessary medical documentation.              56 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code 2500.40(c) (2009); see also Truger v. Department of Human Rights, 293 Ill. App. 3d\n\n851, 861 (1997) (“employee has the burden of asserting the duty and showing the\n\naccommodation was requested and necessary for adequate job performance”).                 “Once an\n\nemployee requests an accommodation, it becomes the burden of the employer to show that there\n\nis no possible reasonable accommodation or that the employee would be unable to perform the\n\njob even with the accommodation.” Department of Corrections v. Human Rights Comm’n, 298\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nIll. App. 3d 536, 542 (1998).      An accommodation may include: “alteration of the facility or\n\nwork site; modification of work schedules or leave policy; acquisition of equipment; job\n\nrestructuring; provision of readers or interpreters; and other similar actions.” 56 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n2500.40(a) (2009). The duty to accommodate does not require an employer to reassign or\n\ntransfer an employee whose disability precludes him or her from performing the employee’s\n\npresent position.   Fitzpatrick v. Human Rights Comm’n, 267 Ill. App. 3d 386, 392 (1994).\n\n¶ 56   The statute itself expressly imposes a duty to reasonably accommodate only with respect\n\nto: (1) “an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious observance or practice without undue\n\nhardship on the conduct of the employer’s business” (emphasis added) (775 ILCS 5/2-101(F)\n\n(West 2014)); (2) employees or applicants who are affected by a condition related to pregnancy or\n\nchildbirth (775 ILCS 5/2-102(I) (West 2014)); and (3) in the context of real estate transactions,\n\nbuyers’ or renters’ disabilities (775 ILCS 5/3-102.1(C) (West 2014)).\n\n¶ 57   In adding section 2-102(I) of the Human Rights Act to address pregnancy-related\n\naccommodations, the General Assembly expressly found: “Employers are familiar with the\n\nreasonable accommodations framework.            Indeed, employers are required to reasonably\n\naccommodate people with disabilities. Sadly, many employers refuse to provide reasonable\n\naccommodations or decline to extend workplace injury policies to pregnant women.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.) Pub. Act 98-1050, § 5(4) (eff. Jan. 1, 2015).\n\n¶ 58   The City argues that plaintiff cannot state a cognizable civil rights violation in her\n\nreasonable-accommodation count, because the Human Rights Act unambiguously does not\n\nexpressly impose on employers a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled\n\nemployees.    If there is no statutory basis for the alleged duty, the regulations cannot create such\n\na duty; rather, the better approach, the City urges (and as discussed in the next section), is to treat\n\n\n\n                                                - 26 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\na failure to provide a reasonable accommodation as an element of the prima facie case for\n\nplaintiff’s claim in count II, for disability discrimination based on disparate treatment.     Under\n\nthe City’s reading, if the General Assembly had intended to make an employer’s failure to\n\nreasonably accommodate a disability an independent civil rights violation, then it would have\n\nenacted a statutory amendment expressly stating so, just as it did with respect to pregnant\n\nemployees and real estate transactions.    By example, the City notes that the General Assembly\n\nspecifically amended the Human Rights Act to add sections 2-102(J) and 3-102.1(C), despite the\n\nexistence of statutory provisions that already made it a civil rights violation to discriminate in the\n\n“terms, privileges or conditions of employment” on the basis of pregnancy or to commit\n\nunlawful discrimination in the “terms, conditions or privileges of a real estate transaction.” See\n\nPub. Act 98-1050 (eff. Jan. 1, 2015) (adding 775 ILCS 5/2-102(j)); Pub. Act 86-910 (eff. Sept. 1,\n\n1989) (adding 775 ILCS 5/3-102.1).        Citing case law that stands for the proposition that a\n\nstatutory amendment creates a presumption that the legislature intended to change the law\n\n(People v. Hicks, 119 Ill. 2d 29, 34 (1987)), the City argues that these amendments reflect the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s determination that a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation is a\n\ndistinct species of civil rights violation that must be specifically enumerated in order to be\n\nproscribed.   It also suggests that its reading is logical because a reasonable-accommodation\n\nobligation essentially changes the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment” by imposing\n\non an employer an affirmative duty to treat different employees differently due to their unique\n\nneeds.   Employers have no notice, the City asserts, that the Human Rights Act obligates them to\n\ndevelop reasonable-accommodation practices for employees’ disabilities.         It also notes that the\n\nHuman Rights Act’s definition of religion expressly states that an employer must provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation. 775 ILCS 5/2-101(F) (West 2014).              Finally, the City notes that\n\n\n\n                                                - 27 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nthe Human Rights Act’s definition of unlawful discrimination does not require a reasonable\n\naccommodation, in contrast to the ADA, which does so in a comparable definition.           See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12112(a), (b)(5)(A) (2012) (defining “discriminate against a qualified individual on the\n\nbasis of disability” to include the failure to provide reasonable accommodation).\n\n¶ 59   No case has squarely addressed this issue, but case law has assumed that employers have\n\na duty to reasonably accommodate a disability.         See, e.g., Truger, 293 Ill. App. 3d at 861\n\n(referring to “an employer’s duty to accommodate” a disability, without deciding whether duty is\n\nstatutorily imposed); Fitzpatrick v. Human Rights Comm’n, 267 Ill. App. 3d 386, 392 (1994)\n\n(same and further holding that such duty extends only to accommodating a disabled employee in\n\nhis or her present position); Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. Human Rights Comm’n, 190 Ill. App.\n\n3d 1036, 1050 (1989) (referring to duty to accommodate, without deciding whether duty is\n\nstatutorily imposed).    In addition, there is case law specifically citing or applying the\n\nregulations, which were initially promulgated in 1982.     6 Ill. Reg. 11489 (eff. Sept. 15, 1982);\n\nsee, e.g., Brewer v. Board of Trustees, 339 Ill. App. 3d 1074, 1080 (2003) (further noting that\n\ndisability discrimination includes failure to reasonably accommodate), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Blount v. Stroud, 232 Ill. 2d 302 (2009); Department of Corrections, 298 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 541-43 (noting that, once the employee requests accommodation, it becomes the employer’s\n\nburden to show that there is no possible reasonable accommodation or that the employee would\n\nbe unable to perform job even with accommodation; holding that failure to provide reasonable\n\naccommodation violated the statute); Whipple v. Department of Rehabilitation Services, 269 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 554, 559 (1995) (citing regulations for proposition that an employer can rebut a\n\ndiscrimination charge by showing that the claimant was unqualified even with accommodation).\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 28 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 60   We find the statute ambiguous, defer to the Commission, and hold that the regulations are\n\na valid exercise of its power to interpret the Human Rights Act and, further, that a reasonable\n\naccommodation claim may be brought as a separate claim under section 2-102(A).              We find\n\nunconvincing the City’s argument that the General Assembly’s amendment of the Human Rights\n\nAct to add the pregnancy-accommodation provision and its failure to similarly add a\n\ndisability-accommodation provision reflects that no such duty exists with respect to disability.\n\nAlthough the duty exists only via regulation, we note that the regulations have been in effect for\n\nover 30 years without specific action by the General Assembly.        Thus, for over three decades,\n\nemployers have been on notice of their obligations with respect to disabled employees.      We find\n\nadditional support for our conclusion in the fact that, in enacting the pregnancy-accommodation\n\nprovision, the General Assembly expressly found: “Employers are familiar with the reasonable\n\naccommodations framework.        Indeed, employers are required to reasonably accommodate\n\npeople with disabilities.” (Emphasis added.) Pub. Act 98-1050, § 5(4) (eff. Jan. 1, 2015). The\n\nGeneral     Assembly’s      acknowledgement,        in    the    legislative    findings,    of    a\n\nreasonable-accommodation duty and its enactment of pregnancy-related protections reflect, in our\n\nview, its approval of the Commission’s reasonable-accommodation regulations.\n\n¶ 61   We also reject the City’s argument that the fact that the Human Rights Act’s definition of\n\n“religion” contains a reasonable-accommodation requirement but the disability provisions do not\n\nevinces the legislature’s determination that no accommodation duty exists with respect to disabled\n\nemployees. The City elsewhere contends that the only civil rights violations are those expressly\n\nstated in section 1-103(D), which defines “civil rights violation” to include only those set forth in\n\nspecific sections of the statute. 775 ILCS 5/1-103(D) (West 2014) (specifying, inter alia,\n\nsections 2-102, 2-103, 2-105, and 3-102.1). The definition of “religion” is contained in section\n\n\n\n                                               - 29 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n2-101, a provision that is not included in the definition of “civil rights violation.” Thus, the City’s\n\nargument, that a “civil rights violation” must be expressly noted in section 1-103(D), fails.\n\n¶ 62    Finally, we similarly reject the City’s argument that a reasonable-accommodation\n\nobligation changes the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment.”                 This position is\n\nillogical.    Taking reasonable steps to place a disabled person in a position to perform his or her\n\njob without discrimination does not change the terms, privileges, or conditions of that person’s\n\nemployment on the basis of discrimination. See 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2014) (prohibiting\n\nactions with respect to the conditions of employment on the basis of unlawful discrimination).\n\n¶ 63                                      (ii) Prima Facie Case\n\n¶ 64    The City next contends that a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation should be\n\npart of a prima facie case for unlawful discrimination (pointing again to count II of plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint, where she alleges disparate treatment), not a separate, distinct, or independent civil\n\nrights violation.     It contends that, by pleading refusal to accommodate (count I), disparate\n\ntreatment (count II), and hostile work environment (count IV), plaintiff is seeking a triple\n\nrecovery for the same alleged discriminatory acts. 10          Plaintiff’s position is that a failure to\n\nprovide a reasonable accommodation is a separate disability discrimination theory.                 For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we conclude that a reasonable-accommodation claim is a distinct action that\n\nmay be separately/alternatively pleaded.\n\n¶ 65    Counts I, II, and IV each allege adverse employment consequences, and each is based on\n\na different theory.     In count I, the refusal-to-accommodate claim, plaintiff alleged that: she was\n\nqualified to perform and adequately performed her job; her medical conditions (unipolar\n\ndepression, anxiety, panic attacks, and partial hearing loss) constituted a disability under the\n\n        10\n             Count III is a retaliation claim, which is not relevant to this certified question.\n\n\n\n                                                   - 30 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nstatute; plaintiff communicated to the City that she sought a reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability; the City had a duty to engage in the interactive process; the City dismissed plaintiff’s\n\nrequest; and the City denied her request without making an individualized assessment; and, as a\n\nresult, she sustained damages.    In count II, the disparate-treatment claim, plaintiff alleged that:\n\nher medical conditions constituted a disability under the statute; she was qualified for and\n\nadequately performed her job; the City terminated her employment because she was disabled;\n\nother individuals who did not have such a disability were assigned her duties; other employees\n\nwere not terminated for behavior similar to or worse than that for which plaintiff was terminated;\n\nplaintiff’s disability was a substantial and motivating factor in the City’s decision to terminate\n\nplaintiff; the City would not have terminated her absent consideration of her disability; and the\n\ntermination constituted intentional disability discrimination in violation of the statute.   In count\n\nIV, the hostile-work-environment claim, plaintiff alleged that: her medical conditions constituted\n\na disability under the statute; the work environment created by her coworkers substantially\n\ninterfered with her work performance and created an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work\n\nenvironment; the City was aware of the environment but failed to take action to make the\n\nconduct cease and desist; the environment aggravated her medical conditions; and, as a result,\n\nplaintiff sustained damages.\n\n¶ 66   In analyzing employment discrimination actions under the Act, courts use the analytical\n\nframework contained in decisions addressing Title VII and other federal statutes.       Zaderaka v.\n\nHuman Rights Comm’n, 131 Ill. 2d 172, 178 (1989).           Within this framework, a plaintiff can\n\nprove discrimination in one of two ways: (1) through direct evidence; or (2) through the indirect\n\nmethod of proof.    Lalvani v. Human Rights Comm’n, 324 Ill. App. 3d 774, 790 (2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 31 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 67   In the indirect method, the plaintiff uses the framework for Title VII claims set forth in\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).                Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne\n\nCommunity Schools, 100 F.3d 1281, 1283 (7th Cir. 1996) (McDonnell Douglas method is used to\n\nindirectly establish discrimination).   First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination, which will give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the employer unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated.    Next, to rebut the presumption, the employer must articulate a legitimate and\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its action.     If the employer meets its burden of production, the\n\npresumption of unlawful discrimination falls.           Then, the plaintiff must prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the employer’s reason was simply a pretext for unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.   Peck v. Department of Human Rights, 234 Ill. App. 3d 334, 336-37 (1992).\n\n“The indirect method is a formal way of analyzing a discrimination case when a certain kind of\n\ncircumstantial evidence—evidence that similarly situated employees not in the plaintiff’s\n\nprotected class were treated better—would permit a jury to infer discriminatory intent.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) Smith v. Chicago Transit Authority, 806 F.3d 900, 905 (7th Cir. 2015).\n\n¶ 68   In contrast, the direct method refers to “anything other than the McDonnell Douglas\n\nindirect approach.” (Emphasis in original.) Id. at 904. To directly prove discrimination, the\n\nemployee may present direct evidence of an employer’s discriminatory intent or relevant\n\ncircumstantial evidence (e.g., suspicious timing, ambiguous statements, treatment of other\n\nemployees in the protected class) pointing to a discriminatory reason for the employer’s action.\n\nId. at 905. Once the employee directly establishes that in making its decision the employer\n\nsubstantially relied on a prohibited factor, the burden of proof, not merely of production, shifts to\n\nthe employer to show that it would have made the same decision even if the prohibited factor had\n\nnot been considered. Lalvani, 324 Ill. App. 3d at 790. The indirect method is relevant here.\n\n\n\n                                               - 32 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 69    Returning to the indirect method, to establish a prima facie case of disability\n\ndiscrimination, as set forth in McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he or\n\nshe is disabled as defined in the Act; (2) his or her disability is unrelated to the plaintiff’s ability\n\nto perform the functions of the job he or she was hired to perform; and (3) an adverse job action\n\nwas taken against the plaintiff because of the disability.      Department of Corrections v. Human\n\nRights Comm’n, 298 Ill. App. 3d 536, 540 (1998).          However, to prove a failure to accommodate\n\na disability, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he or she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2)\n\nthe employer was aware of the disability; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably\n\naccommodate the disability. See, e.g., Curtis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 807 F.3d 215, 224\n\n(7th Cir. 2015); cf. Robinson v. Village of Oak Park, 2013 IL App (1st) 121220, ¶ 36 (separately\n\nassessing religious-discrimination and reasonable-accommodation claims; stating that reasonable\n\naccommodation claim is established by first showing three-part prima facie case: (1) a religious\n\npractice/belief that conflicts with an employment requirement; (2) communication by the\n\nemployee to the employer of the need to observe the religious practice/belief; and (3) adverse\n\nemployment action because of the employee’s religious practice/belief; further noting that, if\n\nemployee establishes prima facie case, the burden shifts to employer to show either that\n\nreasonable accommodation was offered or that any accommodation would result in undue\n\nhardship). 11\n\n¶ 70    Generally, employment discrimination claims assert either disparate treatment or\n\ndisparate impact. Peyton v. Department of Human Rights, 298 Ill. App. 3d 1100, 1108 (1998).\n\n        11\n             Robinson cites a Seventh Circuit case using the McDonnell Douglas framework for a\n\nreasonable-accommodation claim. Robinson, 2013 IL App (1st) 121220, ¶ 36 (citing Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Comm’n v. Ilona of Hungary, Inc., 108 F.3d 1569, 1575 (7th Cir. 1997)).\n\n\n\n                                                 - 33 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nA disparate-treatment claim, which plaintiff seeks to allege in count II, requires a showing “that\n\nthe employer simply treated some people less favorably than others because of their race, color,\n\nreligion, sex, or national origin.”       (Internal quotation marks omitted.)      Id.   Under a\n\ndisparate-impact theory, which was not alleged by plaintiff here, there must be a showing of\n\n“employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in\n\nfact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.”\n\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.      Proof of discriminatory motive is required under a\n\ndisparate-treatment theory but not a disparate-impact theory.   Id.\n\n¶ 71       However, a question exists concerning how reasonable-accommodation claims should be\n\ntreated.     There is ADA case law that holds that a “plaintiff need not allege either disparate\n\ntreatment or disparate impact in order to state a reasonable accommodation claim” (McGary v.\n\nCity of Portland, 386 F.3d 1259, 1266 (9th Cir. 2004)), because a reasonable-accommodation\n\nclaim asserts solely that an employer has failed to reasonably accommodate the employee’s\n\ndisability, not that the employer treated the employee differently and less favorably than other,\n\nnondisabled employees (Bultemeyer, 100 F.3d at 1283 (“He is not comparing his treatment to\n\nthat of any other *** employee.       His complaint relates solely to [the defendant’s] failure to\n\nreasonably accommodate his disability.”)).       The McGary court noted that “the crux of a\n\nreasonable accommodation claim is a facially neutral requirement that is consistently enforced”\n\nand that the reasonable-accommodation requirement’s purpose “is to guard against the façade of\n\n‘equal treatment’ when particular accommodations are necessary to level the playing field.”\n\nMcGary, 386 F.3d at 1267; see also Riel v. Electronic Data Systems Corp., 99 F.3d 678, 681 (5th\n\nCir. 1996) (“By requiring reasonable accommodation, the ADA shifts away from similar\n\ntreatment to different treatment of the disabled by accommodating their disabilities.”).      The\n\n\n\n                                               - 34 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nlogic behind these holdings is that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is not\n\nappropriate, because it is used to prove indirectly that an employer discriminated against an\n\nemployee, whereas a claim for failing to reasonably accommodate a disability alleges facts that,\n\nif proven, directly establish a violation of the ADA. Bultemeyer, 100 F.3d at 1283.      “There is\n\nno need for indirect proof or burden shifting,” because the employee is not alleging that he or she\n\nwas treated differently and less favorably than nondisabled employees. Id.\n\n¶ 72   Illinois case law has not directly addressed this issue and reflects some confusion as to\n\nhow to treat such claims.   Some cases fit the accommodation issue within the prima facie case.\n\nSee, e.g., Department of Corrections, 298 Ill. App. 3d at 541-43 (characterizing the reasonable\n\naccommodation regulations as “augment[ing]” the prima facie requirements and analyzing\n\naccommodation issue in the context of a prima facie disability discrimination case); Whipple v.\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Services, 269 Ill. App. 3d 554, 557-58 (1995) (determining that\n\nprior case law did not address how reasonable-accommodation issue fits within framework and\n\nconcluding that “we would expand the second prong of the” prima facie test to incorporate\n\nreasonable-accommodation analysis), abrogated on other grounds by Webb v. Lustig, 298 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 695 (1998); Milan v. Human Rights Comm’n, 169 Ill. App. 3d 979, 984 (1988) (holding\n\nthat prima facie case of disability discrimination includes reasonable-accommodation issue,\n\nwithout specifying how it factors into analysis).   Other case law recites the McDonnell Douglas\n\nframework, but reflects an uncertainty as to how the reasonable-accommodation analysis fits\n\nwithin it and/or separately addresses the issue without comment.            See, e.g., Owens v.\n\nDepartment of Human Rights, 356 Ill. App. 3d 46, 53 (2005) (after finding that claimant was\n\ndischarged for a nondiscriminatory reason, turning to reasonable-accommodation issue and\n\ncharacterizing it as “a more fundamental issue that we are required to address”); Truger, 293 Ill.\n\n\n\n                                              - 35 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nApp. 3d at 860-61 (reciting framework, concluding that second and third prima facie\n\nrequirements were not met, and then separately addressing several additional issues, including\n\nreasonable-accommodation argument, without explaining its import to prima facie case or the\n\nframework in general); Illinois Bell Telephone, 190 Ill. App. 3d at 1050 (after affirming\n\nadministrative finding that the plaintiff was terminated because of her disability, turning next to\n\nseparately assess reasonable-accommodation issue).\n\n¶ 73   We find the ADA cases persuasive and hold that a reasonable-accommodation claim\n\nconstitutes a separate type of disability discrimination claim that is distinct from\n\ndisparate-treatment and disparate-impact claims.        In count I (refusal to accommodate), plaintiff\n\nargued that the City failed to consider her accommodation request and denied it without making\n\nan individualized assessment.    In count II, she alleged disparate treatment, asserting that she\n\nwas terminated because of her disability.     As plaintiff notes, a fact finder could, on the one\n\nhand, find that, although the City did not violate its duty to accommodate plaintiff, it nonetheless\n\nterminated her employment because of an unlawful motive related to her disability; or, on the\n\nother hand, it could find that the City violated its duty to accommodate but did not terminate\n\nplaintiff’s employment because of an unlawful motive.            Thus, the claims are distinct, they\n\ninvolve different facts and considerations, and they are established by different approaches.\n\nBultemeyer, 100 F.3d at 1283 (no need for indirect proof or burden shifting to establish failure to\n\nreasonably accommodate; alleged facts, if proven, would directly establish violation of ADA).\n\n¶ 74   The cases upon which the City relies do not persuade us to hold otherwise.         See Harton\n\nv. City of Chicago Department of Public Works, 301 Ill. App. 3d 378, 390-92 (1998) (rejecting\n\nargument that an employer commits a per se civil rights violation when it fails to investigate\n\npossibility of accommodation, even if applicant could not have performed job even with\n\n\n\n                                               - 36 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\naccommodation; commenting that court did “not wish to be interpreted as suggesting that\n\nemployers should neglect to explore *** reasonable accommodation,” because the failure “to do\n\nso might well expose an employer to liability under the [Human Rights] Act if it is subsequently\n\ndetermined that a reasonable accommodation would have enabled the applicant to perform the\n\njob despite her disability”); Truger, 293 Ill. App. 3d at 861 (noting duty to accommodate\n\ndisability, but holding that the plaintiff’s claim failed because she offered no evidence that she\n\nasked for a reasonable accommodation or that any type of accommodation would enable her to\n\nperform her job); Whipple, 269 Ill. App. 3d at 559 (applying regulations to hold, in part, that\n\nemployer rebutted discrimination charge by showing that the employee was unqualified even\n\nwith accommodation, i.e., third prong of prima facie case not met).    These cases do not address\n\nthe issue before us.\n\n¶ 75   We also reject the City’s argument that a reasonable-accommodation claim may not be\n\nbrought as a separate claim because this would result in double or even triple (as the City alleges\n\nhere) recovery for the same alleged discriminatory acts.     See Wilson v. Hoffman Group, Inc.,\n\n131 Ill. 2d 308, 320-22 (1989) (“The law in Illinois is that a plaintiff shall have only one\n\nrecovery for an injury [citation]; double recovery is a result which has been condemned\n\n[citation].”); see also Kim v. Alvey, Inc., 322 Ill. App. 3d 657, 672 (2001) (double recovery is\n\nagainst public policy).      The City claims that the only injury asserted here is plaintiff’s\n\ntermination and that she can recover only once for this alleged injury if she proves that the City\n\nviolated the Act.      We cannot question the policy against multiple recovery and we agree, for\n\nexample, that a successful plaintiff cannot recover two back-pay awards for the same period.\n\nHowever, even if a plaintiff alleges the same injury in multiple counts, which plaintiff here did\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 37 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nnot necessarily do, 12 the policy against multiple recoveries does not preclude a plaintiff from\n\nasserting alternative theories of recovery in separate counts of a complaint. See Robinson, 2013\n\nIL App (1st) 121220, ¶¶ 23-35 (the plaintiff brought separate claims, one alleging religious\n\ndiscrimination and one alleging failure to accommodate her religious beliefs; the reviewing court\n\nseparately analyzed the claims because, although the “two claims are factually related, they are\n\nanalytically distinct”).\n\n¶ 76    Finally, the City asks us to hold as a matter of law that plaintiff’s request for appropriate\n\naction to stop the harassment was not a request for a reasonable accommodation cognizable\n\nunder the statute.    For two reasons, we decline to address this question.    It was not certified by\n\nthe trial court, and, contrary to the City’s assertion, it involves factual considerations that are\n\ninappropriate in a Rule 308 appeal.\n\n¶ 77    In summary as to the first certified question, we hold that: (1) section 2-102(A) prohibits\n\nhostile-work-environment disability harassment; and (2) reasonable-accommodation claims may\n\nbe brought as separate claims under that section.            We do not address whether plaintiff\n\nsufficiently pleaded any of her claims.\n\n¶ 78                                 E. Second Certified Question\n\n¶ 79    The second certified question 13 asks:\n\n\n\n        12\n             In count I (refusal to accommodate), plaintiff alleged unspecified damages as a result of\n\nthe City’s refusal to accommodate; in count II (disparate treatment), she alleged termination of\n\nemployment; and, in count IV (hostile work environment), she alleged interference with her work\n\nperformance and aggravation of her medical conditions.\n        13\n             The Department does not offer an argument with respect to this question.\n\n\n\n                                                 - 38 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n               If section 2-102(A) permits a cause of action for disability harassment, does the\n\n       provision in section 2-102(D) “that an employer shall be held responsible for sexual\n\n       harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or nonmanagerial and\n\n       nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the conduct and fails\n\n       to take reasonable corrective measures” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014)) similarly\n\n       apply to a cause of action for disability harassment brought under section 2-102(A)?    If\n\n       yes, does the employee or the employer bear the burden of alleging and proving that the\n\n       employer: (a) is aware of the conduct by its nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory\n\n       employees; and (b) fails to take reasonable corrective measures?           If no, can the\n\n       employer assert the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense to a hostile-work-environment\n\n       harassment claim brought under section 2-102(A)?\n\n¶ 80          (1) Does Section 2-102(D) Apply to Disability Harassment Claims?\n\n¶ 81   In the first part of the second certified question, the issue is whether the parameters in\n\nsection 2-102(D) apply to disability harassment claims brought under section 2-102(A).   For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we hold that those parameters apply to such claims.\n\n¶ 82   Again, the statute’s plain language is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.\n\nDeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 59.    We resort to statutory-construction aids only when the statute is\n\nambiguous.     Id.   We also place substantial weight on and accord deference to the\n\nCommission’s interpretation of the statute.   See Wanless, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 403.\n\n¶ 83   In proscribing sexual harassment, section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act states that it\n\nis a civil rights violation “[f]or any employer, employee, agent of any employer, employment\n\nagency or labor organization to engage in sexual harassment; provided, that an employer shall be\n\nresponsible for sexual harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or\n\n\n\n                                              - 39 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nnonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the\n\nconduct and fails to take reasonable corrective measures.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(D) (West 2014).     Thus, in the context of claims of sexual harassment, the Human\n\nRights Act provides that, where the offending employee is nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory,\n\nsuch as here, the employer is liable for the sexual harassment only if it: (1) was aware of the\n\nconduct; and (2) failed to take corrective measures.    Id.   However, if the offending employee\n\nis supervisory, regardless of whether he or she has authority to affect the terms and conditions of\n\nthe complainant’s employment, the employer is strictly liable for the sexual harassment,\n\nregardless of whether the employer knew of the conduct.         Sangamon County, 233 Ill. 2d at\n\n137-39.\n\n¶ 84   Further, although the parties do not address it, we note that, by rule, the Commission and\n\nDepartment have proscribed national origin harassment, including hostile-work-environment\n\nharassment.   56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900 (1986).        In the regulations, they have adopted a\n\nstandard of employer liability for coworker harassment nearly identical to that for sexual\n\nharassment.   Compare 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900(d) (1986) (“[w]ith respect to conduct\n\nbetween fellow employees, an employer is responsible for acts of harassment, in the workplace\n\non the basis of national origin, where the employer, its agents or supervisory employees, [(1)]\n\nbecomes aware of the conduct, and [(2)] fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective\n\naction”) with 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014) (employer is liable for coworker sexual\n\nharassment only if it: (1) was aware of the conduct; and (2) failed to take corrective measures).\n\nThey have also done the same with respect to supervisory harassment.       Compare 56 Ill. Adm.\n\nCode 5220.900(c) (1986) (employer is liable “regardless of whether the specific acts complained\n\nof were authorized or even forbidden by the employer and regardless of whether the employer\n\n\n\n                                              - 40 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nknew or should have known of their occurrence”) with 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014) (strict\n\nliability regardless of whether the employer knew of the conduct and regardless of whether the\n\noffending employee has authority to affect the terms and conditions of the complainant’s\n\nemployment).\n\n¶ 85   The standard for coworker harassment under federal law is similar.      Title VII does not\n\nrequire or expect employers “to be aware of every impropriety committed by every low-level\n\nemployee.” Hall v. Bodine Electric Co., 276 F.3d 345, 356 (7th Cir. 2002).         Rather, under\n\nfederal law, when the harassing employee is a coworker, the employer is liable under Title VII\n\n“only if it was negligent in controlling working conditions.” Vance v. Ball State University,\n\n570 U.S. ___, ___, 133 S. Ct. 2434, 2439 (2013).      The employer was negligent “if the employer\n\nknew or reasonably should have known about the harassment but failed to take remedial action.”\n\nId. at ___, 133 S. Ct. at 2440-41; Faragher, 524 U.S. at 789.         In the case of supervisory\n\nharassment, the federal standard differs somewhat from that under the Human Rights Act.        If\n\nthe harassing employee was a supervisor and the harassment resulted in tangible employment\n\naction, the employer is strictly liable. Vance, 570 U.S. at ___, 133 S. Ct. at 2439; Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 807; Burlington Industries, Inc., 524 U.S. at 765.    If the harassing employee was a\n\nsupervisor, but the harassment did not result in tangible employment action, the employer may\n\nraise the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense that: (1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent\n\nand correct the harassment; and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of the\n\npreventive or corrective opportunities the employer provided.     Vance, 570 U.S. at ___, 133 S.\n\nCt. at 2439; Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807; Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765.          Under federal law, a\n\n“supervisor” for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII is an employee who “is\n\nempowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim.” Vance,\n\n\n\n                                             - 41 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n570 U.S. at ___, 133 S. Ct. at 2439.               The Faragher and Ellerth cases involved\n\nhostile-work-environment sexual harassment claims. Id. at ___ n.3, 133 S. Ct. at 2442 n.3.\n\nSeveral federal courts of appeals have applied the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense to other\n\ntypes of hostile-work-environment claims. Id. at ___ n.3, 133 S. Ct. at 2442 n.3.\n\n¶ 86   Turning to the case before us, the City’s position is that section 2-102(D)’s parameters for\n\nemployer liability should apply to disability harassment claims and that plaintiff must show her\n\naffirmative compliance with the City’s reporting and corrective policies as a precondition to\n\nestablishing the City’s liability. Plaintiff’s position is that section 2-102(D)’s parameters do not\n\napply and that compliance with any City policies is not a precondition, but should be assessed only\n\nwithin the McDonnell Douglas framework.\n\n¶ 87   The City notes that section 2-102(D) provides that, in the case of nonsupervisory\n\nharassment, an employer is liable only if it: (1) was aware of the conduct; and (2) failed to take\n\nreasonable corrective measures. The City does not disagree that claims under the Human Rights\n\nAct should be analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, but it urges this\n\ncourt to construe the statute to require an employee like plaintiff to show affirmative compliance\n\nwith her employer’s reasonable reporting and corrective policies as a necessary precondition to\n\nestablishing liability under the statute. In the City’s view, such a bright-line rule is consistent\n\nwith the Human Rights Act and the General Assembly’s purpose in protecting employers from\n\nunfounded charges, preventing harassment, promoting conciliation rather than litigation, and\n\nensuring that victims do not profit from their failure to mitigate avoidable consequences.\n\n¶ 88   As support for this position, the City points to the legislative history of section 2-102(D).\n\nDuring the House proceedings, Representative Currie stated, in response to a question about\n\nemployer liability for nonsupervisory sexual harassment:\n\n\n\n                                               - 42 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n       “If the issue is two co-workers, I think the Bill *** will *** make clear that if the company\n\n       has a policy, a practice, a review process for dealing with complaints of sex harassment,\n\n       that review policy would have to be instituted before it would be appropriate for the\n\n       complaint to come before the Commission.” 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings,\n\n       Mar. 23, 1983, at 57-58 (statements of Representative Currie).\n\n¶ 89   Plaintiff first argues that section 2-102(D)’s parameters should not apply to disability\n\nharassment    claims    under    section   2-102(A),     because    a   contrary    reading   violates\n\nstatutory-construction rules. Plaintiff suggests that, instead of section 2-102(D)’s provisions, the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework adequately governs the parties’ respective\n\nburdens of proof as to a hostile-work-environment disability claim under section 2-102(A).\n\nSpecifically, once plaintiff sets forth her prima facie case of discrimination based on a hostile work\n\nenvironment, it then becomes the City’s burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for its actions. Plaintiff suggests that the City could set forth that it had no notice of the\n\nharassment or that it took reasonable corrective measures to prevent it. Then, plaintiff notes, she\n\ncould rebut the City’s allegations by showing that its assertion is pretext, such as by showing that\n\nthe City was aware of the hostile work environment or that plaintiff reported the harassment.\n\nPlaintiff urges, however, that this court not find that the failure to use an employer’s policies is an\n\nabsolute bar to a hostile-work-environment claim. Instead, she suggests that a plaintiff can\n\ncontest that assertion under the McDonnell Douglas framework, under which a plaintiff always\n\nmaintains the ultimate burden of proof (e.g., to show that, in a case of coworker harassment, the\n\nemployer was negligent).\n\n¶ 90   Having held above that section 2-102(A) proscribes disability harassment, we conclude\n\nthat the statute is ambiguous as to whether section 2-102(D)’s parameters for employer liability for\n\n\n\n                                                - 43 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nsexual harassment also apply to disability harassment. Thus, we turn to statutory-construction\n\naids.\n\n¶ 91      Assessing the Commission’s interpretation and mindful of the policy underlying the\n\nstatute, we hold that section 2-102(D)’s parameters apply to claims brought under section\n\n2-102(A) for disability harassment.           Our reading is consistent with the Commission’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute, under which the Commission promulgated nearly identical\n\nparameters for employer liability for national origin harassment. 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900\n\n(1986).      Applying section 2-102(D)’s parameters to disability harassment claims will result in\n\nconsistent treatment of all types of harassment claims under the Human Rights Act, and\n\nconsistency promotes the policy to secure for all persons freedom from discrimination.\n\n¶ 92      The City urges that we further hold that an employee’s failure to use an employer’s\n\nformal antiharassment policy absolutely bars his or her harassment claim.               The legislative\n\nhistory the City noted above reflects that using an employer’s antiharassment reporting\n\nmechanism or policy was contemplated by the General Assembly as a means to finding employer\n\nliability.    It is unclear to us if it goes as far as the City’s reading, i.e., that a failure to use a\n\npolicy constitutes an absolute bar.       Specifically it is unclear if the statute’s requirement of\n\nemployer awareness of harassment contemplates actual and constructive notice of the\n\nharassment.      Cf. Vance, 570 U.S. at ___, 133 S. Ct. at 2439 (under Title VII, employer is\n\nnegligent and thus liable for coworker harassment if it knew or reasonably should have known of\n\nthe harassment and failed to take remedial action).        In any event, the certified question asks us\n\nto answer only whether section 2-102(D)’s awareness and corrective-measure parameters apply\n\nto harassment cases under section 2-102(A).         The City’s argument addresses an issue beyond\n\nthat certified for our review.    Accordingly, we do not reach it.\n\n\n\n                                                  - 44 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 93        (2) Burden of Proving Awareness and Failure to Take Corrective Measures\n\n¶ 94     Given our holding as to the first part of the second certified question—that section\n\n2-102(D)’s parameters apply to disability harassment claims brought under section\n\n2-102(A)—we note that the second part of the second certified question asks: If yes, does the\n\nemployee or the employer bear the burden of alleging and proving that the employer: (a) is aware\n\nof the conduct by its nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees; and (b) fails to take\n\nreasonable corrective measures?          It has been noted that, under the McDonnell Douglas\n\nframework, the ultimate burden of persuasion always rests with the plaintiff; only the burden of\n\nproduction shifts between the plaintiff and the employer.        St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks,\n\n509 U.S. 502, 510 (1993); see also Mockler v. Multnomah County, 140 F.3d 808, 812 (9th Cir.\n\n1998) (under Title VII, the plaintiff must establish employer’s knowledge and lack of effectual\n\ncorrective action).   In our view, the statutory language does not suggest any departure from this\n\ngeneral rule.   Thus, we conclude that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving awareness and\n\nfailure to take corrective measures.\n\n¶ 95     In summary, as to the second certified question, we hold that the parameters for employer\n\nliability under section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act apply to disability harassment claims\n\nbrought under section 2-102(A) and that the employee bears the burden of persuasion with\n\nrespect to such claims.\n\n¶ 96                                   F. Third Certified Question\n\n¶ 97     The third certified question asks: does the Tort Immunity Act apply to a civil action\n\nunder the Human Rights Act where the plaintiff seeks damages, reasonable attorney fees, and\n\ncosts?    If yes, should this court modify, reject, or overrule its holdings, in Birkett, 325 Ill. App.\n\n3d at 202, Firestone, 119 Ill. App. 3d at 689, and Streeter, 44 Ill. App. 3d at 394-95, that “the\n\n\n\n                                                 - 45 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nTort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does not bar actions for constitutional\n\nviolations” (Birkett, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 202)?    The City argues that the Tort Immunity Act\n\napplies to plaintiff’s Human Rights Act claims because they are not claims under the Illinois\n\nConstitution.   Alternatively, the City contends that we should reject our previous holdings that\n\nthe Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does not apply to actions for constitutional\n\nviolations.   For the following reasons, we conclude that the Tort Immunity Act applies to\n\nactions under the Human Rights Act.      The City can assert immunity with respect to plaintiff’s\n\nrequest for damages but not to her request for equitable relief.         We acknowledge that the\n\nsupreme court has impliedly rejected our holdings that the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort\n\nactions and does not apply to constitutional claims.         Accordingly, we do not follow that\n\nprecedent.\n\n¶ 98                                (1) Statutory Frameworks\n\n¶ 99                                  (a) Tort Immunity Act\n\n¶ 100 The 1970 Illinois Constitution abolished the doctrine of sovereign immunity, except as\n\nthe General Assembly may provide by statute.           Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, § 4.   Thus, the\n\nGeneral Assembly is “the ultimate authority in determining whether local units of government\n\nare immune from liability.”   (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Harris v. Thompson, 2012 IL\n\n112525, ¶ 16.    The Tort Immunity Act’s purpose “is to protect local public entities and public\n\nemployees from liability arising from the operation of government.” 745 ILCS 10/1-101.1(a)\n\n(West 2014).    By providing immunity, the General Assembly sought to prevent public funds\n\nfrom being diverted from their intended purpose to the payment of damages claims. Village of\n\nBloomingdale v. CDG Enterprises, Inc., 196 Ill. 2d 484, 490 (2001).         The Tort Immunity Act\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 46 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\ndoes not create duties but, rather, merely codifies existing common-law duties, to which the\n\ndelineated immunities apply. Id.\n\n¶ 101 The Tort Immunity Act adopts the general principle that local governmental units are\n\nliable in tort and other civil actions, but it limits this liability with an extensive list of immunities\n\nbased on specific government functions. Barnett v. Zion Park District, 171 Ill. 2d 378, 386\n\n(1996).   The statute is in derogation of the common law and, therefore, must be strictly\n\nconstrued against the public entities involved. Aikens v. Morris, 145 Ill. 2d 273, 278 (1991).\n\n¶ 102 Section 2-101 of the Tort Immunity Act states that it does not affect the right to obtain\n\nrelief, other than damages, against a local public entity or public employee.                745 ILCS\n\n10/2-101 (West 2014).      Further, the statute expressly states that it does not affect the liability of\n\na local public entity or public employee based on: (1) contract; (2) operation as a common\n\ncarrier; (3) the Workers’ Compensation Act (820 ILCS 305/1 et seq. (West 2014)); (4) the\n\nWorkers’ Occupational Diseases Act (820 ILCS 310/1 et seq. (West 2014)); (5) section 1-4-7 of\n\nthe Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-4-7 (West 2014) (municipal liability for damage to\n\nproperty by the removal, destruction, or vacation of any unsafe or unsanitary building)); or (6)\n\nthe Illinois Uniform Conviction Information Act (20 ILCS 2635/1 et seq. (West 2014)).               745\n\nILCS 10/2-101(f) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 103 Section 2-109 of the Tort Immunity Act provides that “[a] local public entity is not liable\n\nfor an injury resulting from an act or omission of its employee where the employee is not liable.”\n\n745 ILCS 10/2-109 (West 2014).           Section 2-201 states: “Except as otherwise provided by\n\nStatute, a public employee serving in a position involving the determination of policy or the\n\nexercise of discretion is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission in determining\n\npolicy when acting in the exercise of such discretion even though abused.” (Emphases added.)\n\n\n\n                                                 - 47 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n745 ILCS 10/2-201 (West 2014).          Section 1-204, which defines the term “injury,” states, in\n\npart, that the term “includes any injury alleged in a civil action, whether based upon the\n\nConstitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and the statutes or\n\ncommon law of Illinois or of the United States.” 14      (Emphases added.)     745 ILCS 10/1-204\n\n(West 2014).\n\n¶ 104 The supreme court has rejected the claim that the Tort Immunity Act “categorically\n\nexcludes” nontort actions. Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 261\n\n(2004) (“we do not adopt or approve of the appellate court’s reasoning that the Tort Immunity\n\nAct categorically excludes actions that do not sound in tort”).   But see Birkett, 325 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 202 (Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and not constitutional violations);\n\nFirestone, 119 Ill. App. 3d at 689 (Tort Immunity Act “applies only to tort actions [citations],\n\nand does not bar a civil rights action”; count alleged equal protection violations of federal and\n\nIllinois constitutions, as well as violation of section 1983); Streeter, 44 Ill. App. 3d at 395 (the\n\nplaintiffs sought damages for county’s vacation of road that they alleged reduced the value of\n\ntheir property without compensation and, separately, they sought compensation for the\n\nunconstitutional taking; court held that claim did not allege a tort but was “analogous to a claim\n\nfor compensation in an eminent domain proceeding”; notice provisions of Tort Immunity Act did\n\nnot bar the plaintiffs’ suit).\n\n        14\n             However, the statute does not shield a defendant from a federal claim, such as a\n\nsection 1983 claim (42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2012)), because the supremacy clause of the United States\n\nConstitution provides that federal laws are supreme to state laws. See Thomas ex rel. Smith v.\n\nCook County Sheriff, 401 F. Supp. 2d 867, 875 (N.D. Ill. 2005); Anderson v. Village of Forest\n\nPark, 238 Ill. App. 3d 83, 92 (1992).\n\n\n\n                                                - 48 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 105                                  (b) Human Rights Act\n\n¶ 106 The Human Rights Act defines “employer” to include: (1) the “State and any political\n\nsubdivision, municipal corporation or other governmental unit or agency, without regard to the\n\nnumber of employees” (775 ILCS 5/2-101(B)(1)(c) (West 2014)); and (2) any “person” (defined\n\nto include “the State of Illinois and its instrumentalities, political subdivisions, [and] units of\n\nlocal government” (775 ILCS 5/1-103(L) (West 2014))) “employing one or more employees\n\nwhen a complainant alleges civil rights violation due to unlawful discrimination based upon his\n\nor her physical or mental disability unrelated to ability, pregnancy, or sexual harassment” (775\n\nILCS 5/2-101(B)(1)(b) (West 2014)).        Further, in section 2-102(A), the Human Rights Act\n\nprovides that it is unlawful for any “employer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with respect\n\nto recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment, selection for training or\n\napprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure or terms, privileges or conditions of employment on\n\nthe basis of unlawful discrimination or citizenship status.”        (Emphasis added.)      775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(A) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 107        (2) Tort Immunity Act Applies to Claims Under the Human Rights Act\n\n¶ 108 The City argues that the Tort Immunity Act applies to plaintiff’s Human Rights Act\n\nclaims because they are not claims under the Illinois Constitution.     Alternatively, it argues that,\n\neven if plaintiff’s claims are constitutionally based, the Tort Immunity Act applies.       The City\n\ncontends that we should reject our previous holdings that the Tort Immunity Act applies only to\n\ntort actions and does not apply to actions for constitutional violations.\n\n¶ 109 Again, in her four-count complaint, plaintiff alleged: (1) refusal to accommodate; (2)\n\ndisparate treatment; (3) retaliation; and (4) hostile work environment. In each count, she sought\n\nback pay, front pay, the value of lost benefits, actual damages, “emotional and other compensatory\n\n\n\n                                                - 49 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\ndamages,” reinstatement with full seniority, attorney fees, and the costs of suit. All of those forms\n\nof relief are available under the Human Rights Act. 775 ILCS 5/8A-104 (West 2014) (among\n\nother forms of relief, the Commission may award: (1) actual damages; (2) hiring, reinstatement or\n\nupgrade, back pay, and fringe benefits; (3) restoration of labor organization membership; and (4)\n\nattorney fees and costs; further, it may (5) make the complainant whole, including by way of\n\nawarding interest); 775 ILCS 5/10-102(C) (West 2014) (circuit court may award: (1) actual and\n\npunitive damages; (2) injunctive relief; and (3) attorney fees and costs to a prevailing party other\n\nthan the State).\n\n¶ 110 The central issue here is whether the Tort Immunity Act applies to plaintiff’s claims for\n\ndamages (i.e., her prayers for “actual damages” and “emotional and other compensatory\n\ndamages”), not her ability to obtain equitable relief. The statute, as noted above, does not affect\n\nthe right to obtain relief, other than damages, against a local public entity or public employee.\n\n745 ILCS 10/2-101 (West 2014); see, e.g., In re Consolidated Objections to Tax Levies of School\n\nDistrict No. 205, 193 Ill. 2d 490, 500-02 (2000) (section 2-101 excludes injunctive remedies\n\nfrom the statute).   Therefore, the City clearly cannot assert immunity with respect to plaintiff’s\n\nrequest for back pay, front pay, lost benefits, or reinstatement.    See, e.g., Hertzberg v. SRAM\n\nCorp., 261 F.3d 651, 659 (7th Cir. 2001) (back pay, front pay, and reinstatement constitute\n\nequitable remedies under Title VII); see also Pals v. Schepel Buick & GMC Truck, Inc., 220 F.3d\n\n495, 501 (7th Cir. 2000) (“[f]ront pay and back pay under Title VII and the ADA are ‘equitable’\n\nmatters, but they still are dollar values”).\n\n¶ 111 We first conclude that claims under the Human Rights Act are constitutionally grounded\n\nand/or derived.      As relevant here, the Human Rights Act expressly implements the\n\nconstitutional guarantee of freedom from disability discrimination in employment (Ill. Const.\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n1970, art. I, § 19).    775 ILCS 5/1-102(F) (West 2014).          The civil rights protected by the\n\nHuman Rights Act are constitutional rights, and, thus, plaintiff’s claims are constitutionally\n\ngrounded and/or derived; they are not tort actions. See Maksimovic v. Tsogalis, 177 Ill. 2d 511,\n\n518 (1997) (“An action to redress a civil rights violation has a purpose distinct from a common\n\nlaw tort action,” and each type of claim must be separately proved); see also Yount v. Hesston\n\nCorp., 124 Ill. App. 3d 943, 947-49 (1984) (the Illinois Constitution does not authorize a private\n\nright of action to enforce section 19 of article I; thus the plaintiff could not bring a private action\n\nunder section 19 for employment discrimination based on disability; the Human Rights Act is the\n\nexclusive remedy that the plaintiff could have pursued); cf. Melvin v. City of Frankfort, 93 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 425, 432 (1981) (holding first that statute that barred disabled applicants from certain\n\nfirefighter positions with municipalities was unconstitutional under section 19; further holding\n\nthat Tort Immunity Act immunized city employees with respect to the applicant’s claim for\n\ndamages, because his pleadings raised constitutional challenge asserting denial of wages, which\n\n“follows the traditional model of a tort claim,” not a contractual one, and thus was barred;\n\nconstitutional provision did not create a contractual right).\n\n¶ 112 Having determined that plaintiff’s claims are constitutionally grounded, we next address\n\nwhether the City may assert immunity as to plaintiff’s claims for damages.           We answer that\n\nquestion in the affirmative.      As noted, the supreme court has rejected the claim that the Tort\n\nImmunity Act “categorically excludes” nontort actions. Raintree Homes, 209 Ill. 2d at 261\n\n(“we do not adopt or approve of the appellate court’s reasoning that the Tort Immunity Act\n\ncategorically excludes actions that do not sound in tort”).     However, as noted, there is case law\n\nin this district that holds that the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort claims and does not\n\napply to constitutional claims.     See Birkett, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 202; Firestone, 119 Ill. App. 3d\n\n\n\n                                                 - 51 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nat 689; Streeter, 44 Ill. App. 3d at 395.   Raintree Homes, in our view, has impliedly rejected our\n\nholdings, including, as relevant here, our holdings that constitutional claims and civil rights\n\nactions are not subject to the Tort Immunity Act.\n\n¶ 113 Given Raintree Home’s pronouncement that the statute generally does not exclude\n\nnontort actions, we turn to the provision that answers the precise question before us.       As the\n\nCity notes, section 1-204 of the Tort Immunity Act, which defines the term “injury,” states, in\n\npart, that the term “includes any injury alleged in a civil action, whether based upon the\n\nConstitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and the statutes or\n\ncommon law of Illinois or of the United States.” (Emphases added.)             745 ILCS 10/1-204\n\n(West 2014); see also 745 ILCS 10/8-101(c) (West 2014) (one-year statute of limitations for a\n\n“civil action” under the Tort Immunity Act; “civil action” includes an action based upon the\n\n“Constitution of this State”).    We agree with the City that the Tort Immunity Act clearly\n\nencompasses constitutional claims, including those brought under the Human Rights Act. 15\n\n¶ 114 In Birkett, we quoted this passage from section 1-204, but we rejected the plaintiff’s\n\nargument that the Tort Immunity Act provided immunity for constitutional causes of action.\n\nBirkett, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 201-02.    We did so without analyzing section 1-204 and apparently\n\nbased our conclusion concerning constitutional claims on our holding that the statute applies\n\nonly to tort actions, as the former necessarily flows from the latter.       Id. at 202 (the statute\n\n“applies only to tort actions and does not bar actions for constitutional violations”).       Birkett\n\ncited Firestone and Streeter, which merely adopted the same erroneous conclusion that the\n\n       15\n            Of course, the Tort Immunity Act would also apply even if a Human Rights Act claim\n\nwere not constitutional, but merely statutory, as it also applies to actions based upon “the statutes\n\n*** of Illinois.” 745 ILCS 10/1-204 (West 2014).\n\n\n\n                                                - 52 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nstatute is limited to tort claims, and Anderson v. Village of Forest Park, 238 Ill. App. 3d 83, 92\n\n(1992), which held that the statute did not apply to a federal (i.e., section 1983) claim.   Those\n\ncases are further problematic because they were decided before or overlooked the amendment of\n\nsection 1-204’s definition of injury to add claims brought under the “Constitution of the State of\n\nIllinois.” See Pub. Act 84-1431, art. 1, § 2 (eff. Nov. 25, 1986 (amending Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985,\n\nch. 85, ¶ 1-204)); see also Stephanie M. Ailor, Notes, The Legislature Versus the Judiciary:\n\nDefining “Injury” Under the Tort Immunity Act, 57 DePaul L. Rev. 1021, 1051-52 (Summer\n\n2008) (addressing the current discrepancy between the statute and outstanding case law and\n\nnoting that the problem “arose from a failure to recognize the statutory amendment”).\n\n¶ 115 In summary, we hold that the Tort Immunity Act applies to actions under the Human\n\nRights Act. The City can assert immunity with respect to plaintiff’s requests for damages but\n\nnot to her requests for equitable relief.   We acknowledge that the supreme court has impliedly\n\nrejected our previous holdings that the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does\n\nnot apply to constitutional claims.   Accordingly, we do not follow that precedent.\n\n¶ 116\n\n¶ 117                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 118 We have answered the certified questions, and we remand the cause to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n¶ 119 Certified questions answered; cause remanded.\n\n¶ 120 JUSTICE McLAREN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n¶ 121 Although I concur with some of what the majority has opined, I must also dissent from\n\nportions of the majority opinion.\n\n¶ 122 First, I dissent from the majority’s determination that the legislature has created the cause\n\n\n\n                                               - 53 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nof action of “disability harassment.” The majority correctly relates that the term “harassment”\n\nand the phrase “hostile or offensive working environment” explicitly appear in the Human Rights\n\nAct in the employment context only in connection with “sexual” harassment. Supra ¶ 29. The\n\nmajority also correctly states that the Human Rights Act: “explicitly prohibits sexual harassment”\n\n(id.); “does not, with respect to employment, explicitly refer to disability harassment” (emphasis\n\nin original) (supra ¶ 34); and “explicitly makes only sexual harassment a civil rights violation”\n\n(emphasis in original) (id.). From these explicit observations, the majority then concludes that\n\nthe Act is “ambiguous” and “does not explicitly state that sexual harassment is the only type of\n\nharassment claim that constitutes a civil rights violation.” Supra ¶ 42.\n\n¶ 123 I believe that the majority is not considering the legal maxim of statutory interpretation\n\n“inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,” which provides that the inclusion of one thing implies the\n\nexclusion of another; in other words, “where a statute lists the thing or things to which it refers, the\n\ninference is that all omissions are exclusions, even in the absence of limiting language.” City of\n\nSt. Charles v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, 395 Ill. App. 3d 507, 509-10 (2009). The efficacy\n\nof this maxim is demonstrated by the logical gymnastics required by the majority’s analysis: while\n\nthe Human Rights Act “explicitly makes only sexual harassment a civil rights violation” (emphasis\n\nin original) (supra ¶ 34), the Act “does not explicitly state that sexual harassment is the only type\n\nof harassment claim that constitutes a civil rights violation” (supra ¶ 42). Simply put, if the\n\nlegislature wanted to enlarge the reach of the statute to include any or all types of harassment\n\nbeyond sexual harassment, it easily could have done so. It did not.\n\n¶ 124 Additionally, if section 2-102(D) was added as a clarification (see supra ¶ 48), it is\n\npuzzling why the clarification was made to “narrowly expand the available protections” (emphasis\n\nin original) (supra ¶ 48) and was not all-inclusive, adding hostile-work-environment harassment as\n\n\n\n                                                 - 54 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\na civil rights violation in regard to all of the enumerated protections. In any event, the fact that\n\nthis question was certified to this court suggests that the legislative “clarification” is far from clear.\n\n¶ 125 I submit that the answer to the first part of the first certified question should be that there is\n\nno statutory cause of action for disability harassment. (However, the complaint stated a cause of\n\naction for disability discrimination.) I would thus answer the question with a qualified negative.\n\n¶ 126 I further dissent, for two reasons, from the majority’s answer to the third certified question.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that the question is a proper question; second, I believe that the majority’s\n\nanswer is incorrect.\n\n¶ 127 I do not believe that there are reasonable grounds for a difference of opinion as to whether\n\nthe Tort Immunity Act applies to a Human Rights Act claim. The form of the question implies\n\nthat we would be effectively overruling three prior decisions of this court. The only reason for us\n\nto depart from this line of cases (stretching back almost 40 years) would be the supreme court’s\n\noverruling of those cases. This has not occurred. Therefore, there is no difference of opinion,\n\nand the question is not a proper question to be answered under Rule 308.\n\n¶ 128 The majority references a quote from Raintree Homes and claims that, by this, the supreme\n\ncourt impliedly rejected our previous holdings. I disagree. The majority states, “The supreme\n\ncourt has rejected the claim that the Tort Immunity Act ‘categorically excludes’ non-tort actions.\n\nRaintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 261 (2004) (‘we do not adopt or\n\napprove of the appellate court’s reasoning that the Tort Immunity Act categorically excludes\n\nactions that do not sound in tort’).” Supra ¶ 8. The supreme court declined to “adopt or\n\napprove” our reasoning; however, the court did not reject our reasoning, nor did it overrule our\n\nholdings. It merely affirmed on a different basis. See Raintree Homes, 209 Ill. 2d at 261. I\n\ninterpret the supreme court’s statement as a general proposition that did not overrule the\n\n\n\n                                                  - 55 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\npreviously cited decisions but merely established an outer limit of the Tort Immunity Act.\n\nAdditionally, the facts in Raintree Homes are not the same, or even substantially the same, as the\n\nfacts herein; thus, Raintree Homes is not controlling. See Blount v. Stroud, 232 Ill. 2d 302, 324\n\n(2009) (“the precedential scope of our decision is limited to the facts that were before us.”); see\n\nalso People v. Trimarco, 364 Ill. App. 3d 549, 555 (2006) (McLaren, J., dissenting).\n\n¶ 129 The supreme court in Raintree Homes also said that “logic” similar to that employed by the\n\nmajority here was not controlling as well:\n\n       “While the Village correctly asserts that Village of Bloomingdale may have implicitly\n\n       found that the Act applied to some nontort actions specifically at issue in that case, such a\n\n       holding does not imply that the Act applies to all nontort actions against a government,\n\n       including impact fee refund actions.” (Emphasis in original.) Raintree Homes, 209 Ill.\n\n       2d at 259.\n\nIn my opinion, Raintree Homes did not address the precedent that the majority here is willing to\n\nreject. Even if it did, the court did not reject it with such a broad generalization. I submit that the\n\nsupreme court might say the same thing quoted above about the majority’s implication that, per the\n\nRaintree Homes generalization, the Tort Immunity Act categorically applies to actions that do not\n\nsound in tort.\n\n¶ 130 The second reason for my dissent from the majority’s answer to the third certified question\n\nis that I believe that the specific inclusion of municipal corporations in the Human Rights Act\n\nmeant that the legislature intended that public employees be given the same rights as employees in\n\nthe private sector. The City claims that these are not rights that are set forth in the constitution. I\n\nsubmit that the Human Rights Act was intended to prescribe the forms of relief for what are\n\nconstitutional rights, and not some brooding omnipresence in the sky. Apparently, the majority\n\n\n\n                                                - 56 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nagrees:\n\n                 “We first conclude that claims under the Human Rights Act are constitutionally\n\n          grounded and/or derived. As relevant here, the Human Rights Act expressly implements\n\n          the constitutional guarantee of freedom from disability discrimination in employment (Ill.\n\n          Const. 1970, art. I, § 19). 775 ILCS 5/1-102(F) (West 2014). The civil rights protected\n\n          by the Human Rights Act are constitutional rights, and, thus, plaintiff’s claims are\n\n          constitutionally grounded and/or derived; they are not tort actions. See Maksimovic v.\n\n          Tsogalis, 177 Ill. 2d 511, 518 (1997) (‘An action to redress a civil rights violation has a\n\n          purpose distinct from a common law tort action’ ***.” Supra ¶ 15.\n\n   I bolster my opinion with the submission that violating the Human Rights Act does not\n\n   comport with any formulation of reasonable policy or exercise of discretion that the Tort\n\n   Immunity Act is supposed to protect. The majority concludes that the Tort Immunity Act’s\n\n   definition of injury is the basis for its application to this cause of action. See supra ¶ 7. This\n\n   is incorrect. I submit that the relationship between plaintiff and defendant here is that of\n\n   employee and employer.          I also submit that plaintiff’s employment contract implicitly\n\n   included the Human Rights Act. Plaintiff’s right to be free from unlawful discrimination in\n\n   the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2014)) is\n\n   based on the fact that she is employed. As such, any injury in this case arose from a breach of\n\n   contract, not from a tort. The Tort Immunity Act explicitly states that it does not affect the\n\n   liability of a local public entity or public employee based on contract. See 745 ILCS\n\n   10/2-101(a) (West 2014); see also Village of Bloomingdale v. CDG Enterprises, Inc., 196 Ill.\n\n   2d 484, 500 (2001). Thus, the Tort Immunity Act does not apply to this contract-based cause\n\n   of action.\n\n\n\n                                                - 57 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n\n\n                          - 58 -\n\f",

Her employer of 20 years, the City of Aurora (the City),\n\nterminated plaintiff’s employment after she made a statement to a coworker in which she used\n\nthe word “idiots.” Plaintiff sued the City, alleging violations of the Illinois Human Rights Act\n\n(Human Rights Act) (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (West 2014)), including refusal to accommodate,\n\ndisparate treatment, retaliation, and hostile work environment. Following several interlocutory\n\ntrial court orders, the City petitioned for leave to appeal under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 308\n\n(eff. Feb. 26, 2010) (permissive interlocutory appeals), asking that we answer the following\n\ncertified questions:\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n                (1) Does section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act prohibit “disability\n\n       harassment” as a civil rights violation?         Alternatively, do counts I (refusal to\n\n       accommodate) and IV (hostile work environment) of plaintiff’s complaint state\n\n       cognizable civil rights violations under that section?\n\n                (2) If section 2-102(A) permits a cause of action for disability harassment, does\n\n       the provision in section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act “that an employer shall be\n\n       held responsible for sexual harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or\n\n       nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the\n\n       conduct and fails to take reasonable corrective measures” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West\n\n       2014)) similarly apply to a cause of action for disability harassment brought under\n\n       section 2-102(A)?     If yes, does the employee or the employer bear the burden of\n\n       alleging and proving that the employer: (a) is aware of the conduct by its nonmanagerial\n\n       and nonsupervisory employees; and (b) fails to take reasonable corrective measures?      If\n                                                                   1\n       no, can an employer assert the Faragher-Ellerth                 affirmative defense to a\n\n       hostile-work-environment harassment claim brought under section 2-102(A)?\n\n\n\n       1\n           With respect to claims brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n(Title VII) (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (2012)), where the harassing employee is a supervisor, but\n\nthe harassment does not result in tangible employment action, an employer may raise the\n\nFaragher-Ellerth affirmative defense that: (1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\n\nthe harassment; and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or\n\ncorrective opportunities the employer provided.

BACKGROUND\n\n¶4                                   A. Plaintiff’s Complaint\n\n¶5     Plaintiff sued the City on January 22, 2014. She had worked for the City from 1992 to\n\nJuly 13, 2012, most recently as a property maintenance compliance officer (reporting to Dave\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nDykstra and Mark Anderson). Plaintiff alleged that she had a medical history of unipolar\n\ndepression, anxiety, panic attacks, and partial hearing loss, which together constituted a\n\n“disability” under section 1-103(I) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1-103(I) (West 2014)).\n\nHer conditions did not prevent her from performing her job duties. However, when she was\n\nprovoked, she was particularly likely to react strongly, though never in a physical manner.\n\nPlaintiff would speak loudly or in a fast-paced manner, especially when provoked or agitated.\n\n¶6     Plaintiff further alleged that she notified the City of her medical conditions, asking it to\n\ntake them into consideration in her requests and attempts to maintain a reasonable and professional\n\nwork environment. The City “failed and refused to take any action.” According to plaintiff, her\n\ncoworkers engaged in an intentional pattern and practice to “agitate, embarrass, humiliate,\n\ndegrade, harass, discriminate and provoke” her, creating a hostile and offensive work\n\nenvironment. This conduct included name-calling (e.g., cuckoo, Shutter’s Island, prostitute,\n\nbitch, ignorant, nuts, crazy, weird, whacko), notes, spitting on her car window, and creating false\n\nrumors. Plaintiff alleged that this was a purposeful effort to cause her emotional distress and\n\nagitate her. She also alleged that certain staff and coworkers falsely claimed that plaintiff was a\n\nphysical threat even though she was not, and never had been, violent.\n\n¶7     Plaintiff alleged that she repeatedly complained to the City (specifically, to Dykstra and\n\nAnderson) and her union representative, but they “failed and refused to take any action” to stop the\n\nbehavior. As a result, plaintiff sustained further emotional harm and aggravation of her medical\n\nconditions. Also, the behavior impacted her ability to concentrate at work. She suffered from\n\ndepression, including fatigue, sadness, helplessness, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, sleep\n\ndisorders, and body aches.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶8      The City asked the union president to guarantee that plaintiff would not engage in physical\n\nviolence in the workplace and the union responded that plaintiff’s counselors and doctors did not\n\ndeem her to be a physical threat but that the union could never guarantee that anyone would never\n\ncommit an act of physical violence in the workplace.\n\n¶9      As of July 2012, a counselor had diagnosed plaintiff as being in the throes of depressive\n\nand panic disorders. On July 3, 2012, plaintiff made a statement to a coworker, using the word\n\n“idiots.” The City then terminated her employment. Plaintiff alleged that other employees had\n\nused far worse words and had not been disciplined. She argued that, if the City had taken\n\nreasonable steps to prevent the harassment, she would not have been in a vulnerable position.\n\nAlso, the City perceived plaintiff as being a risk or a threat to her coworkers and she was\n\ndiscriminated against based on this and her medical history.\n\n¶ 10    Plaintiff’s four-count complaint alleged: (1) refusal to accommodate; (2) disparate\n\ntreatment; (3) retaliation; and (4) hostile work environment. She sought back pay, front pay, the\n\nvalue of lost benefits, compensatory damages, reinstatement with full seniority, attorney fees, and\n\nthe costs of her suit. 2\n\n¶ 11    In answers to interrogatories, plaintiff responded that she never filed a harassment\n\ncomplaint pursuant to the City’s anti-harassment policy 3 or initiated with the City’s human\n\n        2\n            Plaintiff first filed her discrimination charge with the Department of Human Rights\n\n(Department). Because the Department did not complete its investigation of her case within 365\n\ndays from the date she filed her charge, it issued a notice authorizing plaintiff to file a civil action\n\nin the appropriate circuit court as of November 18, 2013. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(G) (West 2014).\n        3\n            The policy provides that: “If an employee feels that he/she has experienced or witnessed\n\nharassment, the employee is to immediately report the act of harassment to his/her Immediate\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nresources department a request for a reasonable accommodation under the City’s\n\nreasonable-accommodations policy. 4        However, she stated that she made numerous oral\n\ncomplaints to the City about the harassment.             In count I, she alleged that she reasonably\n\ncommunicated to the City that she was seeking an accommodation due to her medical conditions\n\nand that she made repeated requests to management to take action to stop the harassing and\n\ndemeaning conduct. According to plaintiff, she and her union representative were told that\n\nplaintiff had to “live with it,” “deal with it,” and “ignore it.” They were also told, “I don’t think\n\nthat’s harassment” and “do what you gotta do.”\n\n¶ 12                     B. The City’s Answer and Affirmative Defenses\n\n¶ 13   The City admitted that, prior to July 2012, it had received documentation that reflected\n\nthat plaintiff had been diagnosed with unipolar depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and partial\n\nhearing loss.   However, it denied most of plaintiff’s allegations, including that her medical\n\nconditions constituted a disability or that they caused her difficulty at work.\n\n¶ 14   The City also raised several affirmative defenses: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\n(all counts); (2) the existence of a policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation\n\nSupervisor, Division Director, Department Head, Corporation Counsel or Director of Human\n\nResources.” The policy does not specify that the report must be in writing.\n       4\n           That policy provides that, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n(ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.

Human Rights Act Framework\n\n¶ 26   The Human Rights Act expressly implements the guarantees provided by article I,\n\nsections 17, 18, and 19, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, §§ 17, 18, 19).   775\n\nILCS 5/1-102(F) (West 2014). The statute provides a comprehensive scheme to “secure for all\n\nindividuals within Illinois the freedom from discrimination against any individual because of his\n\nor her race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, marital\n\nstatus, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or\n\nunfavorable discharge from military service in connection with employment, real estate\n\ntransactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.”\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n(Emphases added.) 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) (West 2014).

Id.\n\n¶ 27    Sections 2-102 and 6-101 of the Human Rights Act set forth what constitute civil rights\n\nviolations in employment.     Section 2-102(A) provides that it is a civil rights violation “[f]or any\n\nemployer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with respect to recruitment, hiring, promotion,\n\nrenewal of employment, selection for training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure or\n\nterms, privileges or conditions of employment on the basis of unlawful discrimination or\n\ncitizenship status.” (Emphases added.) 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2014). Other subsections\n\nof section 2-102 prohibit: employers’ restrictions on use of a language in communications\n\nunrelated to the employee’s duties (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A-5) (West 2014)), employment agency\n\ndiscrimination (775 ILCS 5/2-102(B) (West 2014)), labor organization discrimination (775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(C) (West 2014)), sexual harassment by various entities/persons, including employers\n\nand employees (775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014)), public employers’ restrictions on\n\nemployees’ practice of their religious beliefs (775 ILCS 5/2-102(E) (West 2014)), age\n\ndiscrimination by employers or labor organizations with respect to selection for or conduct of\n\napprenticeship    or   training   programs   (775    ILCS    5/2-102(F)    (West    2014));   certain\n\nimmigration-related practices (775 ILCS 5/2-102(G) (West 2014)); pregnancy discrimination\n\nand refusals of pregnancy-related requests for reasonable accommodations (775 ILCS 5/2-102(I),\n\n(J) (West 2014)); and the failure to post notices concerning employees’ rights under the statute\n\n(775 ILCS 5/2-102(K) (West 2014)). The statute also prohibits retaliation against a person\n\nbecause he or she has opposed, inter alia, unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment, because\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nhe or she has filed a charge, or because he or she has requested a reasonable accommodation.\n\n775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 28     “Unlawful discrimination” is defined as “discrimination against a person because of his\n\nor her race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, order of protection\n\nstatus, disability, military status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or unfavorable discharge from\n\nmilitary service as those terms are defined in this Section.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS\n\n5/1-103(Q) (West 2014).      “Disability,” in turn, is defined, in part, as “a determinable physical\n\nor mental characteristic of a person *** which may result from disease, injury, congenital\n\ncondition of birth or functional disorder” and “is unrelated to the person’s ability to perform the\n\nduties of a particular job or position.” 775 ILCS 5/1-103(I)(1) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 29     The term “harassment” explicitly appears in the Human Rights Act in the employment\n\ncontext only with respect to “sexual harassment,” which is defined as “any unwelcome sexual\n\nadvances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when (1) submission to\n\nsuch conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s\n\nemployment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis\n\nfor employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect\n\nof substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,\n\nhostile or offensive working environment.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS 5/2-101(E) (West\n\n2014).    Similarly, the term “hostile or offensive working environment” explicitly appears only\n\nin this context.   The Human Rights Act explicitly prohibits sexual harassment.       It provides that\n\nit is a civil rights violation “[f]or any employer, employee, agent of any employer, employment\n\nagency or labor organization to engage in sexual harassment; provided, that an employer shall be\n\nresponsible for sexual harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nnonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the\n\nconduct and fails to take reasonable corrective measures.” 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014);\n\nsee also Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department v.

First Certified Question\n\n¶ 31   The first certified question asks: “Does section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act\n\nprohibit ‘disability harassment’ as a civil rights violation?   Alternatively, do counts I and IV of\n\nplaintiff’s complaint state cognizable civil rights violations under that section?” For clarity and\n\nto more accurately reflect the parties’ arguments, we address whether the following claims are\n\ncognizable under the statute: (1) hostile-work-environment disability harassment (count IV); and\n\n(2) refusal to provide reasonable accommodation (count I).\n\n¶ 32                  (1) Hostile-Work-Environment Disability Harassment\n\n¶ 33   In count IV, plaintiff alleged that the City violated her civil rights by failing to take\n\nactions to stop the harassment/hostile work environment based upon her disability. This claim\n\nrelies on section 2-102(A).\n\n¶ 34   As noted above, although the Human Rights Act explicitly references disability\n\ndiscrimination (in section 2-102(A)), it does not, with respect to employment, explicitly refer to\n\ndisability harassment.     Rather, it explicitly makes only sexual harassment a civil rights\n\nviolation.   775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014); see also 775 ILCS 5/5A-102 (West 2014)\n\n(prohibiting sexual harassment in education, but not referring to disability harassment in that\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\ncontext). 6    Also, in the statute’s declaration of policy, the General Assembly explicitly\n\nrecognized the public policies to secure freedom from unlawful discrimination (in section\n\n1-102(A)) and, separately, freedom from sexual harassment in employment and education (in\n\nsection 1-102(B)). 7\n\n¶ 35    The City contends that the Human Rights Act unambiguously reflects that discrimination\n\nand (only sexual) harassment are separate and distinct civil rights violations.   It further asserts\n\nthat, had the General Assembly intended to prohibit a hostile work environment based on\n\ndisability (i.e., disability harassment), it would have done so by making disability harassment a\n\nseparate civil rights violation, just as it did for sexual harassment.    (In 1983, the General\n\nAssembly amended the Human Rights Act to add a provision addressing “sexual harassment”\n\nunder sections 2-102(D) (in employment) and 5A-102(A) (in education).        Pub.

Code 5220.900 (1986).\n        7\n            In the same provision, the legislature also listed as public policies: freedom from\n\nemployment discrimination based on citizenship status (775 ILCS 5/1-102(C) (West 2014));\n\nfreedom from discrimination based on familial status in real estate transactions (775 ILCS\n\n5/1-102(D) (West 2014)); public health, welfare, and safety (775 ILCS 5/1-102(E) (West 2014));\n\nimplementation of the aforementioned constitutional guarantees (775 ILCS 5/1-102(F) (West\n\n2014)); equal opportunity and affirmative action by the State (775 ILCS 5/1-102(G) (West 2014));\n\nand freedom from unfounded charges of discrimination, sexual harassment in employment or\n\neducation, and employment discrimination based on citizenship status (775 ILCS 5/1-102(H)\n\n(West 2014)).\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n5A-102).) Alternatively, the City contends that the General Assembly could have amended\n\nsection 2-102(A) to expressly clarify that unlawful discrimination includes harassment/hostile\n\nwork environment, but it did not do so.\n\n¶ 36   Pointing to foreign authority, the City contends that there is a well-recognized distinction\n\nbetween discrimination and harassment.

In support, they point to: (1) case law that\n\nrecognized harassment/hostile work environment claims before the enactment of section\n\n2-102(D); (2) Commission interpretations; and (3) longstanding case law addressing racial\n\nharassment claims (which they note would not constitute viable civil rights violations if the\n\nCity’s argument were correct).\n\n¶ 38   We turn first to the cases upon which plaintiff and the Department rely.

However, we find\n\nthese cases inopposite. Board of Trustees addressed the Department’s jurisdiction to hear racial\n\ndiscrimination claims against a public university and whether a public university was subject to\n\nthe statute.   The court, in dicta, stated that its conclusion that academic programs were not\n\n“accommodations” under the statute was “bolstered” by the 1983 amendment that specifically\n\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nconferred on the Department jurisdiction over claims of sexual harassment in higher education,\n\nbut the court did not address whether sexual harassment was a civil rights violation before the\n\namendment.       Board of Trustees, 159 Ill. 2d at 213.   As the Department notes, the question in\n\nBoard of Trustees was who was subject to the Human Rights Act, not what was prohibited by it.\n\nFurther, the question whether racial harassment claims were cognizable under the statute was not\n\nbefore the court.    Similarly, Sangamon County provides no guidance here because it did not\n\naddress the issue in this case; it involved discrimination by a supervisory employee, which is not\n\nat issue here.   Sangamon County, 233 Ill. 2d at 138-41.\n\n¶ 41    The City contends that, unlike Title VII, which does not expressly distinguish between\n\nharassment and discrimination, the General Assembly’s 1983 amendment reflects its intent to\n\ncreate a separate and distinct cause of action only for sexual harassment and to expand the scope\n\nof an employer’s liability for a supervisor’s harassment by imposing strict liability for any\n\nsupervisory sexual harassment, without regard to whether it culminates in tangible employment\n\naction or the supervisor has authority over the victim’s terms, privileges, or conditions of\n\nemployment.      The City also urges that the decision to expand beyond sexual harassment the\n\nHuman Rights Act’s protection against harassment in the workplace rests with the legislative\n\nbranch, not the judicial branch.\n\n¶ 42    We reject the City’s arguments. We find the statute ambiguous.       The ambiguity stems\n\nfrom the statute’s prohibition in section 2-102(A) of unlawful discrimination with respect to the\n\nterms, privileges, or conditions of employment, which can reasonably be read to include\n\nharassment on the basis of an enumerated characteristic.       Indeed, in Old Ben Coal, the Fifth\n\nDistrict held as much with respect to sexual harassment prior to the legislature’s enactment of\n\nsection 2-102(D).     Old Ben Coal, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 309.   Also, the statute does not explicitly\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nstate that sexual harassment is the only type of harassment that constitutes a civil rights violation.\n\nHowever, another reading of the Human Rights Act is that the enactment of section 2-102(D)\n\neffectuated a change of existing law to add sexual harassment as an additional civil rights\n\nviolation, to the (implicit) exclusion of other types of harassment.\n\n¶ 43   Having determined that the statute is ambiguous, we turn to statutory-construction aids.\n\nIn our view, they support an expansive reading of section 2-102(A), such as the approach taken\n\nin Old Ben Coal, and lead to the conclusion that disability harassment is a cognizable civil rights\n\nviolation under section 2-102(A).\n\n¶ 44   First, we consider the Human Rights Act’s purposes.         One of them is to “secure for all\n\nindividuals *** the freedom from discrimination against any individual because of his or her ***\n\nphysical or mental disability *** in connection with employment.”             775 ILCS 5/1-102(A)\n\n(West 2014).    It also implements several constitutional guarantees, including section 19 of\n\narticle I, which provides: “All persons with a physical or mental handicap *** shall be free from\n\ndiscrimination unrelated to ability in the hiring and promotion practices of an employer” (Ill.\n\nConst. 1970, art. I, § 19).   775 ILCS 5/2-102(F) (West 2014).         Reading section 2-102(A) to\n\nprohibit disability harassment undoubtedly comports with these purposes.\n\n¶ 45   Turning to a second statutory-construction aid, the type of legislation, we note that the\n\nHuman Rights Act constitutes remedial legislation, which is liberally construed to effectuate its\n\npurposes.   Arlington Park Race Track, 199 Ill. App. 3d at 703.        Broadly construing the phrase\n\n“terms, privileges or conditions of employment” in section 2-102(A) to prohibit a hostile work\n\nenvironment based on disability is clearly consistent with the statute’s purpose to effectuate the\n\nright of every disabled person to be free from workplace discrimination.         We find additional\n\nsupport for this conclusion in the fact that the Commission, which, jointly with the Department,\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nis the agency charged with enforcing the Human Rights Act (Boaden v.

Hum. Rts. Comm’n\n\nRep. 1988CN0644, at *3 (May 28, 1996) (finding that the employee established verbal\n\nharassment on the basis of race).    The Commission has also noted in its decisions that, though\n\nthere is no case law on the issue of disability harassment, “there is no logical reason why the\n\n[Human Rights] Act should tolerate workplace harassment based on a handicap when it does not\n\ntolerate harassment based on any other protected classification.            [Citation.]   Therefore,\n\nComplainant’s handicap harassment claims should be analyzed in the same manner as the racial\n\nand gender harassment claims.” Gonzalez, Ill. Hum. Rts. Comm’n Rep. 2006CF2012, at *8\n\n(Aug. 23, 2010); see also 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900 (1986) (proscribing national origin\n\nharassment). We place significant weight on these interpretations.          See Wanless v. Human\n\nRights Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2074970\"><a href=\"/opinion/2074970/wanless-v-illinois-human-rights-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248424\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248424/valley-mould-iron-v-human-rights-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 279\n\n(1985)), has been interpreted in a similar fashion.     In Meritor Savings Bank, 477 U.S. at 66, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the creation of a hostile work environment through harassment is a\n\nform of proscribed discrimination under Title VII.          The Court determined that the phrase\n\n“terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,” which appears in both Title VII and the\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nHuman Rights Act, reflects a legislative intent to encompass the full spectrum of discriminatory\n\ntreatment in employment. Id. at 64.       It also noted that EEOC guidelines, which it found\n\ninstructive, defined sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.     Id. at 65.   The Court\n\nfurther noted that the guidelines had drawn on case law that held that Title VII\n\nhostile-work-environment claims could be brought in the contexts of race, religion, and national\n\norigin; thus, reading the statute to proscribe a hostile environment based on discriminatory sexual\n\nharassment was consistent with the case law.    Id. at 66. 9\n\n¶ 47   We reject the City’s argument that Title VII case law is unhelpful because that statute\n\ndoes not explicitly and separately address sexual harassment, as the Human Rights Act does.\n\nThis argument is unavailing because the Title VII case law interprets the phrase “terms,\n\n       9\n           Title VII does not address disability; however, the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n\n1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (2012)) does by prohibiting certain employers from\n\ndiscriminating against individuals on the basis of their disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (2012).\n\nThat statute also contains the phrase “terms, conditions, and privileges of employment” (42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12112(a) (2012)).

The legislative\n\nhistory of section 2-102(D) reflects that the provision was added to the statute to clarify existing\n\npractices and to narrowly expand the available protections (the latter with respect to same-sex\n\nharassment and male victims, which are not alleged here).      It clearly did not effect a change in\n\nthe law by creating a new cause of action.    See Old Ben Coal, 150 Ill. App. 3d at 307 (coming\n\nto the same conclusion: “both proponents and opponents of the amendment considered sexual\n\nharassment to be prohibited by the *** Human Rights Act as a form of sex discrimination and\n\nthat the amendment was needed only to clarify this proscription” (emphasis added)).         During\n\nthe House debates, the sponsor, Representative Currie, responded as follows to the question\n\nwhether sexual harassment cases had “currently” been considered sex discrimination cases by\n\nthe Department and the Commission:\n\n       “Presently, the [Department] understands that it may interpret its authority to deal with\n\n       sex discrimination to include instances of sex harassment.      The [Department] supports\n\n       this Bill, as does the Commission, on the grounds that there is some ambiguity in that\n\n       decision.   It’s based on council’s opinion.     Councils can change.    Only through that\n\n       opinion is the Department able to establish rules and regulations. It would become much\n\n       clearer if we were to establish this program in the state statutes themselves.   In addition,\n\n       same sex harassment or harassment when the victim is a male can clearly not be covered\n\n       under an interpretation of sex discrimination prohibition which the Department presently\n\n       uses for these cases.”    (Emphasis added.) 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings,\n\n       Mar. 23, 1983, at 55 (statements of Representative Currie).\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nLater in the proceedings, she stated that the Department took the position that passage of the\n\namendment would “clarify and specify its authority.”            (Emphasis added.)      Id. at 56.\n\nFurthermore, Representative Mays, an opponent, related a conversation with a Department\n\nrepresentative who was asked if a case had ever come before the Commission that the\n\nDepartment refused to handle; Mays related that the Department responded to that in the\n\nnegative but that the Department surmised that, as to an employer who harassed both male and\n\nfemale employees, a claim could not be brought as discrimination.           Id. at 56-57.   These\n\nexcerpts reflect that the enactment of section 2-102(D) was a clarification of the law with respect\n\nto the issue before us.\n\n¶ 49   The City points to the legislative history of article 5A of the Human Rights Act, which\n\naddresses elementary, secondary, and higher education.      During the House debates on section\n\n5A-102, which prohibits sexual harassment in education, Representative Koehler stated:\n\n       “[This amendment] amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to include sexual harassment\n\n       in higher education as a civil rights violation.         Under the Human Rights Act,\n\n       discrimination on the basis of sex already constitutes a civil rights violation. However,\n\n       it is important to point out that there is a distinct difference between sex discrimination,\n\n       which deals with prejudice[,] and sexual harassment, which deals with a hostile\n\n       environment and repeated torment.” 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 5,\n\n       1983, at 33-34 (statements of Representative Koehler).\n\nAlthough the statement appears to somewhat conflict with the legislative history of section\n\n2-102(D), we do not place much weight on it, because it addresses a different section of the\n\nstatute than the one at issue here and does not specifically address whether harassment claims\n\nwere already being heard under article 5A, as sexual-harassment employment claims were.\n\n\n\n                                              - 23 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 50   In summary, we conclude that the presumption that the 1983 amendment changed the law\n\nhas been rebutted.     We further hold that section 2-102(A) prohibits disability harassment.\n\nAccordingly, we answer the first part of the first certified question in the affirmative.\n\n¶ 51                              (2) Reasonable Accommodation\n\n¶ 52   In count I, plaintiff alleged that the City violated her civil rights by failing to provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation for her disability after she asked it to take appropriate action to stop\n\nher nonsupervisory coworkers’ harassment. This part of the first certified question asks if such\n\na claim is cognizable under section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act.          The City argues that:\n\n(1) the Human Rights Act does not expressly impose such a duty on employers and should not be\n\nread to do so; and (2) a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation should be part of a prima\n\nfacie case for unlawful disability discrimination, not a separate and distinct civil rights violation.\n\nFor the following reasons, we conclude that a reasonable-accommodation claim is cognizable as\n\na separate claim under section 2-102(A).\n\n¶ 53   Preliminarily, we note again that the Human Rights Act is a remedial statute that is\n\nliberally construed to effectuate its purposes.

By joint rule, the Commission and the Department require that\n\nemployers provide reasonable accommodations for “known physical or mental limitations of\n\notherwise qualified disabled applicants or employees,” unless the accommodations are\n\nprohibitively expensive or would unduly disrupt ordinary business conduct.       56 Ill.

The duty to accommodate does not require an employer to reassign or\n\ntransfer an employee whose disability precludes him or her from performing the employee’s\n\npresent position.   Fitzpatrick v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392 (1994).\n\n¶ 56   The statute itself expressly imposes a duty to reasonably accommodate only with respect\n\nto: (1) “an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious observance or practice without undue\n\nhardship on the conduct of the employer’s business” (emphasis added) (775 ILCS 5/2-101(F)\n\n(West 2014)); (2) employees or applicants who are affected by a condition related to pregnancy or\n\nchildbirth (775 ILCS 5/2-102(I) (West 2014)); and (3) in the context of real estate transactions,\n\nbuyers’ or renters’ disabilities (775 ILCS 5/3-102.1(C) (West 2014)).\n\n¶ 57   In adding section 2-102(I) of the Human Rights Act to address pregnancy-related\n\naccommodations, the General Assembly expressly found: “Employers are familiar with the\n\nreasonable accommodations framework.            Indeed, employers are required to reasonably\n\naccommodate people with disabilities. Sadly, many employers refuse to provide reasonable\n\naccommodations or decline to extend workplace injury policies to pregnant women.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.) Pub. Act 98-1050, § 5(4) (eff. Jan. 1, 2015).\n\n¶ 58   The City argues that plaintiff cannot state a cognizable civil rights violation in her\n\nreasonable-accommodation count, because the Human Rights Act unambiguously does not\n\nexpressly impose on employers a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled\n\nemployees.    If there is no statutory basis for the alleged duty, the regulations cannot create such\n\na duty; rather, the better approach, the City urges (and as discussed in the next section), is to treat\n\n\n\n                                                - 26 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\na failure to provide a reasonable accommodation as an element of the prima facie case for\n\nplaintiff’s claim in count II, for disability discrimination based on disparate treatment.     Under\n\nthe City’s reading, if the General Assembly had intended to make an employer’s failure to\n\nreasonably accommodate a disability an independent civil rights violation, then it would have\n\nenacted a statutory amendment expressly stating so, just as it did with respect to pregnant\n\nemployees and real estate transactions.    By example, the City notes that the General Assembly\n\nspecifically amended the Human Rights Act to add sections 2-102(J) and 3-102.1(C), despite the\n\nexistence of statutory provisions that already made it a civil rights violation to discriminate in the\n\n“terms, privileges or conditions of employment” on the basis of pregnancy or to commit\n\nunlawful discrimination in the “terms, conditions or privileges of a real estate transaction.” See\n\nPub. Act 98-1050 (eff. Jan. 1, 2015) (adding 775 ILCS 5/2-102(j)); Pub. Act 86-910 (eff. Sept. 1,\n\n1989) (adding 775 ILCS 5/3-102.1).        Citing case law that stands for the proposition that a\n\nstatutory amendment creates a presumption that the legislature intended to change the law\n\n(People v. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2020328\"><a href=\"/opinion/2020328/people-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1987)), the City argues that these amendments reflect the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s determination that a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation is a\n\ndistinct species of civil rights violation that must be specifically enumerated in order to be\n\nproscribed.   It also suggests that its reading is logical because a reasonable-accommodation\n\nobligation essentially changes the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment” by imposing\n\non an employer an affirmative duty to treat different employees differently due to their unique\n\nneeds.   Employers have no notice, the City asserts, that the Human Rights Act obligates them to\n\ndevelop reasonable-accommodation practices for employees’ disabilities.         It also notes that the\n\nHuman Rights Act’s definition of religion expressly states that an employer must provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation. 775 ILCS 5/2-101(F) (West 2014).              Finally, the City notes that\n\n\n\n                                                - 27 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nthe Human Rights Act’s definition of unlawful discrimination does not require a reasonable\n\naccommodation, in contrast to the ADA, which does so in a comparable definition.           See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12112(a), (b)(5)(A) (2012) (defining “discriminate against a qualified individual on the\n\nbasis of disability” to include the failure to provide reasonable accommodation).\n\n¶ 59   No case has squarely addressed this issue, but case law has assumed that employers have\n\na duty to reasonably accommodate a disability.         See, e.g., Truger, 293 Ill. App. 3d at 861\n\n(referring to “an employer’s duty to accommodate” a disability, without deciding whether duty is\n\nstatutorily imposed); Fitzpatrick v.

Department of Rehabilitation Services, 269 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 554, 559 (1995) (citing regulations for proposition that an employer can rebut a\n\ndiscrimination charge by showing that the claimant was unqualified even with accommodation).\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 28 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 60   We find the statute ambiguous, defer to the Commission, and hold that the regulations are\n\na valid exercise of its power to interpret the Human Rights Act and, further, that a reasonable\n\naccommodation claim may be brought as a separate claim under section 2-102(A).              We find\n\nunconvincing the City’s argument that the General Assembly’s amendment of the Human Rights\n\nAct to add the pregnancy-accommodation provision and its failure to similarly add a\n\ndisability-accommodation provision reflects that no such duty exists with respect to disability.\n\nAlthough the duty exists only via regulation, we note that the regulations have been in effect for\n\nover 30 years without specific action by the General Assembly.        Thus, for over three decades,\n\nemployers have been on notice of their obligations with respect to disabled employees.      We find\n\nadditional support for our conclusion in the fact that, in enacting the pregnancy-accommodation\n\nprovision, the General Assembly expressly found: “Employers are familiar with the reasonable\n\naccommodations framework.        Indeed, employers are required to reasonably accommodate\n\npeople with disabilities.” (Emphasis added.) Pub. Act 98-1050, § 5(4) (eff. Jan. 1, 2015). The\n\nGeneral     Assembly’s      acknowledgement,        in    the    legislative    findings,    of    a\n\nreasonable-accommodation duty and its enactment of pregnancy-related protections reflect, in our\n\nview, its approval of the Commission’s reasonable-accommodation regulations.\n\n¶ 61   We also reject the City’s argument that the fact that the Human Rights Act’s definition of\n\n“religion” contains a reasonable-accommodation requirement but the disability provisions do not\n\nevinces the legislature’s determination that no accommodation duty exists with respect to disabled\n\nemployees. The City elsewhere contends that the only civil rights violations are those expressly\n\nstated in section 1-103(D), which defines “civil rights violation” to include only those set forth in\n\nspecific sections of the statute. 775 ILCS 5/1-103(D) (West 2014) (specifying, inter alia,\n\nsections 2-102, 2-103, 2-105, and 3-102.1). The definition of “religion” is contained in section\n\n\n\n                                               - 29 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n2-101, a provision that is not included in the definition of “civil rights violation.” Thus, the City’s\n\nargument, that a “civil rights violation” must be expressly noted in section 1-103(D), fails.\n\n¶ 62    Finally, we similarly reject the City’s argument that a reasonable-accommodation\n\nobligation changes the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment.”                 This position is\n\nillogical.    Taking reasonable steps to place a disabled person in a position to perform his or her\n\njob without discrimination does not change the terms, privileges, or conditions of that person’s\n\nemployment on the basis of discrimination. See 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2014) (prohibiting\n\nactions with respect to the conditions of employment on the basis of unlawful discrimination).\n\n¶ 63                                      (ii) Prima Facie Case\n\n¶ 64    The City next contends that a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation should be\n\npart of a prima facie case for unlawful discrimination (pointing again to count II of plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint, where she alleges disparate treatment), not a separate, distinct, or independent civil\n\nrights violation.     It contends that, by pleading refusal to accommodate (count I), disparate\n\ntreatment (count II), and hostile work environment (count IV), plaintiff is seeking a triple\n\nrecovery for the same alleged discriminatory acts. 10          Plaintiff’s position is that a failure to\n\nprovide a reasonable accommodation is a separate disability discrimination theory.                 For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we conclude that a reasonable-accommodation claim is a distinct action that\n\nmay be separately/alternatively pleaded.\n\n¶ 65    Counts I, II, and IV each allege adverse employment consequences, and each is based on\n\na different theory.     In count I, the refusal-to-accommodate claim, plaintiff alleged that: she was\n\nqualified to perform and adequately performed her job; her medical conditions (unipolar\n\ndepression, anxiety, panic attacks, and partial hearing loss) constituted a disability under the\n\n        10\n             Count III is a retaliation claim, which is not relevant to this certified question.\n\n\n\n                                                   - 30 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nstatute; plaintiff communicated to the City that she sought a reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability; the City had a duty to engage in the interactive process; the City dismissed plaintiff’s\n\nrequest; and the City denied her request without making an individualized assessment; and, as a\n\nresult, she sustained damages.    In count II, the disparate-treatment claim, plaintiff alleged that:\n\nher medical conditions constituted a disability under the statute; she was qualified for and\n\nadequately performed her job; the City terminated her employment because she was disabled;\n\nother individuals who did not have such a disability were assigned her duties; other employees\n\nwere not terminated for behavior similar to or worse than that for which plaintiff was terminated;\n\nplaintiff’s disability was a substantial and motivating factor in the City’s decision to terminate\n\nplaintiff; the City would not have terminated her absent consideration of her disability; and the\n\ntermination constituted intentional disability discrimination in violation of the statute.   In count\n\nIV, the hostile-work-environment claim, plaintiff alleged that: her medical conditions constituted\n\na disability under the statute; the work environment created by her coworkers substantially\n\ninterfered with her work performance and created an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work\n\nenvironment; the City was aware of the environment but failed to take action to make the\n\nconduct cease and desist; the environment aggravated her medical conditions; and, as a result,\n\nplaintiff sustained damages.\n\n¶ 66   In analyzing employment discrimination actions under the Act, courts use the analytical\n\nframework contained in decisions addressing Title VII and other federal statutes.

Next, to rebut the presumption, the employer must articulate a legitimate and\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its action.     If the employer meets its burden of production, the\n\npresumption of unlawful discrimination falls.           Then, the plaintiff must prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the employer’s reason was simply a pretext for unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.   Peck v.

To directly prove discrimination, the\n\nemployee may present direct evidence of an employer’s discriminatory intent or relevant\n\ncircumstantial evidence (e.g., suspicious timing, ambiguous statements, treatment of other\n\nemployees in the protected class) pointing to a discriminatory reason for the employer’s action.\n\nId. at 905. Once the employee directly establishes that in making its decision the employer\n\nsubstantially relied on a prohibited factor, the burden of proof, not merely of production, shifts to\n\nthe employer to show that it would have made the same decision even if the prohibited factor had\n\nnot been considered.

Id.   Under a\n\ndisparate-impact theory, which was not alleged by plaintiff here, there must be a showing of\n\n“employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in\n\nfact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.”\n\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.      Proof of discriminatory motive is required under a\n\ndisparate-treatment theory but not a disparate-impact theory.   Id.\n\n¶ 71       However, a question exists concerning how reasonable-accommodation claims should be\n\ntreated.     There is ADA case law that holds that a “plaintiff need not allege either disparate\n\ntreatment or disparate impact in order to state a reasonable accommodation claim” (McGary v.\n\nCity of Portland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788128\"><a href=\"/opinion/788128/richard-mcgary-v-city-of-portland/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1266 (9th Cir. 2004)), because a reasonable-accommodation\n\nclaim asserts solely that an employer has failed to reasonably accommodate the employee’s\n\ndisability, not that the employer treated the employee differently and less favorably than other,\n\nnondisabled employees (Bultemeyer, 100 F.3d at 1283 (“He is not comparing his treatment to\n\nthat of any other *** employee.       His complaint relates solely to [the defendant’s] failure to\n\nreasonably accommodate his disability.”)).       The McGary court noted that “the crux of a\n\nreasonable accommodation claim is a facially neutral requirement that is consistently enforced”\n\nand that the reasonable-accommodation requirement’s purpose “is to guard against the façade of\n\n‘equal treatment’ when particular accommodations are necessary to level the playing field.”\n\nMcGary, 386 F.3d at 1267; see also Riel v. Electronic Data Systems Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681 (5th\n\nCir. 1996) (“By requiring reasonable accommodation, the ADA shifts away from similar\n\ntreatment to different treatment of the disabled by accommodating their disabilities.”).      The\n\n\n\n                                               - 34 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nlogic behind these holdings is that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is not\n\nappropriate, because it is used to prove indirectly that an employer discriminated against an\n\nemployee, whereas a claim for failing to reasonably accommodate a disability alleges facts that,\n\nif proven, directly establish a violation of the ADA. Bultemeyer, 100 F.3d at 1283.      “There is\n\nno need for indirect proof or burden shifting,” because the employee is not alleging that he or she\n\nwas treated differently and less favorably than nondisabled employees. Id.\n\n¶ 72   Illinois case law has not directly addressed this issue and reflects some confusion as to\n\nhow to treat such claims.   Some cases fit the accommodation issue within the prima facie case.\n\nSee, e.g., Department of Corrections, 298 Ill.

In count I (refusal to accommodate), plaintiff\n\nargued that the City failed to consider her accommodation request and denied it without making\n\nan individualized assessment.    In count II, she alleged disparate treatment, asserting that she\n\nwas terminated because of her disability.     As plaintiff notes, a fact finder could, on the one\n\nhand, find that, although the City did not violate its duty to accommodate plaintiff, it nonetheless\n\nterminated her employment because of an unlawful motive related to her disability; or, on the\n\nother hand, it could find that the City violated its duty to accommodate but did not terminate\n\nplaintiff’s employment because of an unlawful motive.            Thus, the claims are distinct, they\n\ninvolve different facts and considerations, and they are established by different approaches.\n\nBultemeyer, 100 F.3d at 1283 (no need for indirect proof or burden shifting to establish failure to\n\nreasonably accommodate; alleged facts, if proven, would directly establish violation of ADA).\n\n¶ 74   The cases upon which the City relies do not persuade us to hold otherwise.

These cases do not address\n\nthe issue before us.\n\n¶ 75   We also reject the City’s argument that a reasonable-accommodation claim may not be\n\nbrought as a separate claim because this would result in double or even triple (as the City alleges\n\nhere) recovery for the same alleged discriminatory acts.     See Wilson v.

The City claims that the only injury asserted here is plaintiff’s\n\ntermination and that she can recover only once for this alleged injury if she proves that the City\n\nviolated the Act.      We cannot question the policy against multiple recovery and we agree, for\n\nexample, that a successful plaintiff cannot recover two back-pay awards for the same period.\n\nHowever, even if a plaintiff alleges the same injury in multiple counts, which plaintiff here did\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 37 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nnot necessarily do, 12 the policy against multiple recoveries does not preclude a plaintiff from\n\nasserting alternative theories of recovery in separate counts of a complaint. See Robinson, 2013\n\nIL App (1st) 121220, ¶¶ 23-35 (the plaintiff brought separate claims, one alleging religious\n\ndiscrimination and one alleging failure to accommodate her religious beliefs; the reviewing court\n\nseparately analyzed the claims because, although the “two claims are factually related, they are\n\nanalytically distinct”).\n\n¶ 76    Finally, the City asks us to hold as a matter of law that plaintiff’s request for appropriate\n\naction to stop the harassment was not a request for a reasonable accommodation cognizable\n\nunder the statute.    For two reasons, we decline to address this question.    It was not certified by\n\nthe trial court, and, contrary to the City’s assertion, it involves factual considerations that are\n\ninappropriate in a Rule 308 appeal.\n\n¶ 77    In summary as to the first certified question, we hold that: (1) section 2-102(A) prohibits\n\nhostile-work-environment disability harassment; and (2) reasonable-accommodation claims may\n\nbe brought as separate claims under that section.            We do not address whether plaintiff\n\nsufficiently pleaded any of her claims.\n\n¶ 78                                 E. Second Certified Question\n\n¶ 79    The second certified question 13 asks:\n\n\n\n        12\n             In count I (refusal to accommodate), plaintiff alleged unspecified damages as a result of\n\nthe City’s refusal to accommodate; in count II (disparate treatment), she alleged termination of\n\nemployment; and, in count IV (hostile work environment), she alleged interference with her work\n\nperformance and aggravation of her medical conditions.\n        13\n             The Department does not offer an argument with respect to this question.\n\n\n\n                                                 - 38 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n               If section 2-102(A) permits a cause of action for disability harassment, does the\n\n       provision in section 2-102(D) “that an employer shall be held responsible for sexual\n\n       harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or nonmanagerial and\n\n       nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the conduct and fails\n\n       to take reasonable corrective measures” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014)) similarly\n\n       apply to a cause of action for disability harassment brought under section 2-102(A)?    If\n\n       yes, does the employee or the employer bear the burden of alleging and proving that the\n\n       employer: (a) is aware of the conduct by its nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory\n\n       employees; and (b) fails to take reasonable corrective measures?           If no, can the\n\n       employer assert the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense to a hostile-work-environment\n\n       harassment claim brought under section 2-102(A)?\n\n¶ 80          (1) Does Section 2-102(D) Apply to Disability Harassment Claims?\n\n¶ 81   In the first part of the second certified question, the issue is whether the parameters in\n\nsection 2-102(D) apply to disability harassment claims brought under section 2-102(A).   For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we hold that those parameters apply to such claims.\n\n¶ 82   Again, the statute’s plain language is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.\n\nDeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 59.    We resort to statutory-construction aids only when the statute is\n\nambiguous.     Id.   We also place substantial weight on and accord deference to the\n\nCommission’s interpretation of the statute.   See Wanless, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 403.\n\n¶ 83   In proscribing sexual harassment, section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act states that it\n\nis a civil rights violation “[f]or any employer, employee, agent of any employer, employment\n\nagency or labor organization to engage in sexual harassment; provided, that an employer shall be\n\nresponsible for sexual harassment of the employer’s employees by nonemployees or\n\n\n\n                                              - 39 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nnonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees only if the employer becomes aware of the\n\nconduct and fails to take reasonable corrective measures.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(D) (West 2014).     Thus, in the context of claims of sexual harassment, the Human\n\nRights Act provides that, where the offending employee is nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory,\n\nsuch as here, the employer is liable for the sexual harassment only if it: (1) was aware of the\n\nconduct; and (2) failed to take corrective measures.    Id.   However, if the offending employee\n\nis supervisory, regardless of whether he or she has authority to affect the terms and conditions of\n\nthe complainant’s employment, the employer is strictly liable for the sexual harassment,\n\nregardless of whether the employer knew of the conduct.         Sangamon County, 233 Ill. 2d at\n\n137-39.\n\n¶ 84   Further, although the parties do not address it, we note that, by rule, the Commission and\n\nDepartment have proscribed national origin harassment, including hostile-work-environment\n\nharassment.   56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900 (1986).        In the regulations, they have adopted a\n\nstandard of employer liability for coworker harassment nearly identical to that for sexual\n\nharassment.   Compare 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900(d) (1986) (“[w]ith respect to conduct\n\nbetween fellow employees, an employer is responsible for acts of harassment, in the workplace\n\non the basis of national origin, where the employer, its agents or supervisory employees, [(1)]\n\nbecomes aware of the conduct, and [(2)] fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective\n\naction”) with 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014) (employer is liable for coworker sexual\n\nharassment only if it: (1) was aware of the conduct; and (2) failed to take corrective measures).\n\nThey have also done the same with respect to supervisory harassment.       Compare 56 Ill. Adm.\n\nCode 5220.900(c) (1986) (employer is liable “regardless of whether the specific acts complained\n\nof were authorized or even forbidden by the employer and regardless of whether the employer\n\n\n\n                                              - 40 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nknew or should have known of their occurrence”) with 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D) (West 2014) (strict\n\nliability regardless of whether the employer knew of the conduct and regardless of whether the\n\noffending employee has authority to affect the terms and conditions of the complainant’s\n\nemployment).\n\n¶ 85   The standard for coworker harassment under federal law is similar.      Title VII does not\n\nrequire or expect employers “to be aware of every impropriety committed by every low-level\n\nemployee.” Hall v. Bodine Electric Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776085\"><a href=\"/opinion/776085/louvenia-hall-v-bodine-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (7th Cir. 2002).         Rather, under\n\nfederal law, when the harassing employee is a coworker, the employer is liable under Title VII\n\n“only if it was negligent in controlling working conditions.” Vance v.

If the harassing employee was a\n\nsupervisor, but the harassment did not result in tangible employment action, the employer may\n\nraise the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense that: (1) it exercised reasonable care to prevent\n\nand correct the harassment; and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of the\n\npreventive or corrective opportunities the employer provided.

Ct. at 2442 n.3.\n\n¶ 86   Turning to the case before us, the City’s position is that section 2-102(D)’s parameters for\n\nemployer liability should apply to disability harassment claims and that plaintiff must show her\n\naffirmative compliance with the City’s reporting and corrective policies as a precondition to\n\nestablishing the City’s liability. Plaintiff’s position is that section 2-102(D)’s parameters do not\n\napply and that compliance with any City policies is not a precondition, but should be assessed only\n\nwithin the McDonnell Douglas framework.\n\n¶ 87   The City notes that section 2-102(D) provides that, in the case of nonsupervisory\n\nharassment, an employer is liable only if it: (1) was aware of the conduct; and (2) failed to take\n\nreasonable corrective measures. The City does not disagree that claims under the Human Rights\n\nAct should be analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, but it urges this\n\ncourt to construe the statute to require an employee like plaintiff to show affirmative compliance\n\nwith her employer’s reasonable reporting and corrective policies as a necessary precondition to\n\nestablishing liability under the statute. In the City’s view, such a bright-line rule is consistent\n\nwith the Human Rights Act and the General Assembly’s purpose in protecting employers from\n\nunfounded charges, preventing harassment, promoting conciliation rather than litigation, and\n\nensuring that victims do not profit from their failure to mitigate avoidable consequences.\n\n¶ 88   As support for this position, the City points to the legislative history of section 2-102(D).\n\nDuring the House proceedings, Representative Currie stated, in response to a question about\n\nemployer liability for nonsupervisory sexual harassment:\n\n\n\n                                               - 42 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n       “If the issue is two co-workers, I think the Bill *** will *** make clear that if the company\n\n       has a policy, a practice, a review process for dealing with complaints of sex harassment,\n\n       that review policy would have to be instituted before it would be appropriate for the\n\n       complaint to come before the Commission.” 83d Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings,\n\n       Mar. 23, 1983, at 57-58 (statements of Representative Currie).\n\n¶ 89   Plaintiff first argues that section 2-102(D)’s parameters should not apply to disability\n\nharassment    claims    under    section   2-102(A),     because    a   contrary    reading   violates\n\nstatutory-construction rules. Plaintiff suggests that, instead of section 2-102(D)’s provisions, the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework adequately governs the parties’ respective\n\nburdens of proof as to a hostile-work-environment disability claim under section 2-102(A).\n\nSpecifically, once plaintiff sets forth her prima facie case of discrimination based on a hostile work\n\nenvironment, it then becomes the City’s burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for its actions. Plaintiff suggests that the City could set forth that it had no notice of the\n\nharassment or that it took reasonable corrective measures to prevent it. Then, plaintiff notes, she\n\ncould rebut the City’s allegations by showing that its assertion is pretext, such as by showing that\n\nthe City was aware of the hostile work environment or that plaintiff reported the harassment.\n\nPlaintiff urges, however, that this court not find that the failure to use an employer’s policies is an\n\nabsolute bar to a hostile-work-environment claim. Instead, she suggests that a plaintiff can\n\ncontest that assertion under the McDonnell Douglas framework, under which a plaintiff always\n\nmaintains the ultimate burden of proof (e.g., to show that, in a case of coworker harassment, the\n\nemployer was negligent).\n\n¶ 90   Having held above that section 2-102(A) proscribes disability harassment, we conclude\n\nthat the statute is ambiguous as to whether section 2-102(D)’s parameters for employer liability for\n\n\n\n                                                - 43 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nsexual harassment also apply to disability harassment. Thus, we turn to statutory-construction\n\naids.\n\n¶ 91      Assessing the Commission’s interpretation and mindful of the policy underlying the\n\nstatute, we hold that section 2-102(D)’s parameters apply to claims brought under section\n\n2-102(A) for disability harassment.           Our reading is consistent with the Commission’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute, under which the Commission promulgated nearly identical\n\nparameters for employer liability for national origin harassment. 56 Ill. Adm. Code 5220.900\n\n(1986).      Applying section 2-102(D)’s parameters to disability harassment claims will result in\n\nconsistent treatment of all types of harassment claims under the Human Rights Act, and\n\nconsistency promotes the policy to secure for all persons freedom from discrimination.\n\n¶ 92      The City urges that we further hold that an employee’s failure to use an employer’s\n\nformal antiharassment policy absolutely bars his or her harassment claim.               The legislative\n\nhistory the City noted above reflects that using an employer’s antiharassment reporting\n\nmechanism or policy was contemplated by the General Assembly as a means to finding employer\n\nliability.    It is unclear to us if it goes as far as the City’s reading, i.e., that a failure to use a\n\npolicy constitutes an absolute bar.       Specifically it is unclear if the statute’s requirement of\n\nemployer awareness of harassment contemplates actual and constructive notice of the\n\nharassment.      Cf.

Ct. at 2439 (under Title VII, employer is\n\nnegligent and thus liable for coworker harassment if it knew or reasonably should have known of\n\nthe harassment and failed to take remedial action).        In any event, the certified question asks us\n\nto answer only whether section 2-102(D)’s awareness and corrective-measure parameters apply\n\nto harassment cases under section 2-102(A).         The City’s argument addresses an issue beyond\n\nthat certified for our review.    Accordingly, we do not reach it.\n\n\n\n                                                  - 44 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n¶ 93        (2) Burden of Proving Awareness and Failure to Take Corrective Measures\n\n¶ 94     Given our holding as to the first part of the second certified question—that section\n\n2-102(D)’s parameters apply to disability harassment claims brought under section\n\n2-102(A)—we note that the second part of the second certified question asks: If yes, does the\n\nemployee or the employer bear the burden of alleging and proving that the employer: (a) is aware\n\nof the conduct by its nonmanagerial and nonsupervisory employees; and (b) fails to take\n\nreasonable corrective measures?          It has been noted that, under the McDonnell Douglas\n\nframework, the ultimate burden of persuasion always rests with the plaintiff; only the burden of\n\nproduction shifts between the plaintiff and the employer.

In our view, the statutory language does not suggest any departure from this\n\ngeneral rule.   Thus, we conclude that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving awareness and\n\nfailure to take corrective measures.\n\n¶ 95     In summary, as to the second certified question, we hold that the parameters for employer\n\nliability under section 2-102(D) of the Human Rights Act apply to disability harassment claims\n\nbrought under section 2-102(A) and that the employee bears the burden of persuasion with\n\nrespect to such claims.\n\n¶ 96                                   F.

The City argues that the Tort Immunity Act\n\napplies to plaintiff’s Human Rights Act claims because they are not claims under the Illinois\n\nConstitution.   Alternatively, the City contends that we should reject our previous holdings that\n\nthe Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does not apply to actions for constitutional\n\nviolations.   For the following reasons, we conclude that the Tort Immunity Act applies to\n\nactions under the Human Rights Act.      The City can assert immunity with respect to plaintiff’s\n\nrequest for damages but not to her request for equitable relief.         We acknowledge that the\n\nsupreme court has impliedly rejected our holdings that the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort\n\nactions and does not apply to constitutional claims.

Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, § 4.

The Tort Immunity Act’s purpose “is to protect local public entities and public\n\nemployees from liability arising from the operation of government.” 745 ILCS 10/1-101.1(a)\n\n(West 2014).

Further, the statute expressly states that it does not affect the liability of\n\na local public entity or public employee based on: (1) contract; (2) operation as a common\n\ncarrier; (3) the Workers’ Compensation Act (820 ILCS 305/1 et seq.

Section 2-201 states: “Except as otherwise provided by\n\nStatute, a public employee serving in a position involving the determination of policy or the\n\nexercise of discretion is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission in determining\n\npolicy when acting in the exercise of such discretion even though abused.” (Emphases added.)\n\n\n\n                                                 - 47 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\n745 ILCS 10/2-201 (West 2014).

Further, in section 2-102(A), the Human Rights Act\n\nprovides that it is unlawful for any “employer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with respect\n\nto recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment, selection for training or\n\napprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure or terms, privileges or conditions of employment on\n\nthe basis of unlawful discrimination or citizenship status.”        (Emphasis added.)      775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(A) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 107        (2) Tort Immunity Act Applies to Claims Under the Human Rights Act\n\n¶ 108 The City argues that the Tort Immunity Act applies to plaintiff’s Human Rights Act\n\nclaims because they are not claims under the Illinois Constitution.

The statute, as noted above, does not affect\n\nthe right to obtain relief, other than damages, against a local public entity or public employee.\n\n745 ILCS 10/2-101 (West 2014); see, e.g., In re Consolidated Objections to Tax Levies of School\n\nDistrict No. 205, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2180547\"><a href=\"/opinion/2180547/in-re-consolidated-objections-to-tax-levies-of-sch-dist-no-205/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500-02 (2000) (section 2-101 excludes injunctive remedies\n\nfrom the statute).

Raintree Homes, in our view, has impliedly rejected our\n\nholdings, including, as relevant here, our holdings that constitutional claims and civil rights\n\nactions are not subject to the Tort Immunity Act.\n\n¶ 113 Given Raintree Home’s pronouncement that the statute generally does not exclude\n\nnontort actions, we turn to the provision that answers the precise question before us.       As the\n\nCity notes, section 1-204 of the Tort Immunity Act, which defines the term “injury,” states, in\n\npart, that the term “includes any injury alleged in a civil action, whether based upon the\n\nConstitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Illinois, and the statutes or\n\ncommon law of Illinois or of the United States.” (Emphases added.)             745 ILCS 10/1-204\n\n(West 2014); see also 745 ILCS 10/8-101(c) (West 2014) (one-year statute of limitations for a\n\n“civil action” under the Tort Immunity Act; “civil action” includes an action based upon the\n\n“Constitution of this State”).    We agree with the City that the Tort Immunity Act clearly\n\nencompasses constitutional claims, including those brought under the Human Rights Act. 15\n\n¶ 114 In Birkett, we quoted this passage from section 1-204, but we rejected the plaintiff’s\n\nargument that the Tort Immunity Act provided immunity for constitutional causes of action.\n\nBirkett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

We did so without analyzing section 1-204 and apparently\n\nbased our conclusion concerning constitutional claims on our holding that the statute applies\n\nonly to tort actions, as the former necessarily flows from the latter.       Id. at 202 (the statute\n\n“applies only to tort actions and does not bar actions for constitutional violations”).       Birkett\n\ncited Firestone and Streeter, which merely adopted the same erroneous conclusion that the\n\n       15\n            Of course, the Tort Immunity Act would also apply even if a Human Rights Act claim\n\nwere not constitutional, but merely statutory, as it also applies to actions based upon “the statutes\n\n*** of Illinois.” 745 ILCS 10/1-204 (West 2014).\n\n\n\n                                                - 52 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nstatute is limited to tort claims, and Anderson v. Village of Forest Park, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036157\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036157/anderson-v-village-of-forest-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Those\n\ncases are further problematic because they were decided before or overlooked the amendment of\n\nsection 1-204’s definition of injury to add claims brought under the “Constitution of the State of\n\nIllinois.” See Pub. Act 84-1431, art. 1, § 2 (eff. Nov. 25, 1986 (amending Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985,\n\nch. 85, ¶ 1-204)); see also Stephanie M. Ailor, Notes, The Legislature Versus the Judiciary:\n\nDefining “Injury” Under the Tort Immunity Act, 57 DePaul L. Rev. 1021, 1051-52 (Summer\n\n2008) (addressing the current discrepancy between the statute and outstanding case law and\n\nnoting that the problem “arose from a failure to recognize the statutory amendment”).\n\n¶ 115 In summary, we hold that the Tort Immunity Act applies to actions under the Human\n\nRights Act. The City can assert immunity with respect to plaintiff’s requests for damages but\n\nnot to her requests for equitable relief.   We acknowledge that the supreme court has impliedly\n\nrejected our previous holdings that the Tort Immunity Act applies only to tort actions and does\n\nnot apply to constitutional claims.   Accordingly, we do not follow that precedent.\n\n¶ 116\n\n¶ 117                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 118 We have answered the certified questions, and we remand the cause to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n¶ 119 Certified questions answered; cause remanded.\n\n¶ 120 JUSTICE McLAREN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n¶ 121 Although I concur with some of what the majority has opined, I must also dissent from\n\nportions of the majority opinion.\n\n¶ 122 First, I dissent from the majority’s determination that the legislature has created the cause\n\n\n\n                                               - 53 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nof action of “disability harassment.” The majority correctly relates that the term “harassment”\n\nand the phrase “hostile or offensive working environment” explicitly appear in the Human Rights\n\nAct in the employment context only in connection with “sexual” harassment. Supra ¶ 29. The\n\nmajority also correctly states that the Human Rights Act: “explicitly prohibits sexual harassment”\n\n(id.); “does not, with respect to employment, explicitly refer to disability harassment” (emphasis\n\nin original) (supra ¶ 34); and “explicitly makes only sexual harassment a civil rights violation”\n\n(emphasis in original) (id.). From these explicit observations, the majority then concludes that\n\nthe Act is “ambiguous” and “does not explicitly state that sexual harassment is the only type of\n\nharassment claim that constitutes a civil rights violation.” Supra ¶ 42.\n\n¶ 123 I believe that the majority is not considering the legal maxim of statutory interpretation\n\n“inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,” which provides that the inclusion of one thing implies the\n\nexclusion of another; in other words, “where a statute lists the thing or things to which it refers, the\n\ninference is that all omissions are exclusions, even in the absence of limiting language.” City of\n\nSt. Charles v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509-10 (2009). The efficacy\n\nof this maxim is demonstrated by the logical gymnastics required by the majority’s analysis: while\n\nthe Human Rights Act “explicitly makes only sexual harassment a civil rights violation” (emphasis\n\nin original) (supra ¶ 34), the Act “does not explicitly state that sexual harassment is the only type\n\nof harassment claim that constitutes a civil rights violation” (supra ¶ 42). Simply put, if the\n\nlegislature wanted to enlarge the reach of the statute to include any or all types of harassment\n\nbeyond sexual harassment, it easily could have done so. It did not.\n\n¶ 124 Additionally, if section 2-102(D) was added as a clarification (see supra ¶ 48), it is\n\npuzzling why the clarification was made to “narrowly expand the available protections” (emphasis\n\nin original) (supra ¶ 48) and was not all-inclusive, adding hostile-work-environment harassment as\n\n\n\n                                                 - 54 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\na civil rights violation in regard to all of the enumerated protections. In any event, the fact that\n\nthis question was certified to this court suggests that the legislative “clarification” is far from clear.\n\n¶ 125 I submit that the answer to the first part of the first certified question should be that there is\n\nno statutory cause of action for disability harassment. (However, the complaint stated a cause of\n\naction for disability discrimination.) I would thus answer the question with a qualified negative.\n\n¶ 126 I further dissent, for two reasons, from the majority’s answer to the third certified question.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that the question is a proper question; second, I believe that the majority’s\n\nanswer is incorrect.\n\n¶ 127 I do not believe that there are reasonable grounds for a difference of opinion as to whether\n\nthe Tort Immunity Act applies to a Human Rights Act claim. The form of the question implies\n\nthat we would be effectively overruling three prior decisions of this court. The only reason for us\n\nto depart from this line of cases (stretching back almost 40 years) would be the supreme court’s\n\noverruling of those cases. This has not occurred. Therefore, there is no difference of opinion,\n\nand the question is not a proper question to be answered under Rule 308.\n\n¶ 128 The majority references a quote from Raintree Homes and claims that, by this, the supreme\n\ncourt impliedly rejected our previous holdings. I disagree. The majority states, “The supreme\n\ncourt has rejected the claim that the Tort Immunity Act ‘categorically excludes’ non-tort actions.\n\nRaintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991261\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991261/raintree-homes-inc-v-village-of-long-grove/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (2004) (‘we do not adopt or\n\napprove of the appellate court’s reasoning that the Tort Immunity Act categorically excludes\n\nactions that do not sound in tort’).” Supra ¶ 8. The supreme court declined to “adopt or\n\napprove” our reasoning; however, the court did not reject our reasoning, nor did it overrule our\n\nholdings. It merely affirmed on a different basis. See Raintree Homes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 261. I\n\ninterpret the supreme court’s statement as a general proposition that did not overrule the\n\n\n\n                                                  - 55 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\npreviously cited decisions but merely established an outer limit of the Tort Immunity Act.\n\nAdditionally, the facts in Raintree Homes are not the same, or even substantially the same, as the\n\nfacts herein; thus, Raintree Homes is not controlling. See Blount v. Stroud, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2228217\"><a href=\"/opinion/2228217/blount-v-stroud/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324\n\n(2009) (“the precedential scope of our decision is limited to the facts that were before us.”); see\n\nalso People v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (2006) (McLaren, J., dissenting).\n\n¶ 129 The supreme court in Raintree Homes also said that “logic” similar to that employed by the\n\nmajority here was not controlling as well:\n\n       “While the Village correctly asserts that Village of Bloomingdale may have implicitly\n\n       found that the Act applied to some nontort actions specifically at issue in that case, such a\n\n       holding does not imply that the Act applies to all nontort actions against a government,\n\n       including impact fee refund actions.” (Emphasis in original.) Raintree Homes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n       <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 259.\n\nIn my opinion, Raintree Homes did not address the precedent that the majority here is willing to\n\nreject. Even if it did, the court did not reject it with such a broad generalization. I submit that the\n\nsupreme court might say the same thing quoted above about the majority’s implication that, per the\n\nRaintree Homes generalization, the Tort Immunity Act categorically applies to actions that do not\n\nsound in tort.\n\n¶ 130 The second reason for my dissent from the majority’s answer to the third certified question\n\nis that I believe that the specific inclusion of municipal corporations in the Human Rights Act\n\nmeant that the legislature intended that public employees be given the same rights as employees in\n\nthe private sector. The City claims that these are not rights that are set forth in the constitution. I\n\nsubmit that the Human Rights Act was intended to prescribe the forms of relief for what are\n\nconstitutional rights, and not some brooding omnipresence in the sky. Apparently, the majority\n\n\n\n                                                - 56 -\n\f2016 IL App (2d) 150493\n\n\nagrees:\n\n                 “We first conclude that claims under the Human Rights Act are constitutionally\n\n          grounded and/or derived. As relevant here, the Human Rights Act expressly implements\n\n          the constitutional guarantee of freedom from disability discrimination in employment (Ill.\n\n          Const. 1970, art. I, § 19). 775 ILCS 5/1-102(F) (West 2014). The civil rights protected\n\n          by the Human Rights Act are constitutional rights, and, thus, plaintiff’s claims are\n\n          constitutionally grounded and/or derived; they are not tort actions. See Maksimovic v.\n\n          Tsogalis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230031\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230031/maksimovic-v-tsogalis/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518 (1997) (‘An action to redress a civil rights violation has a\n\n          purpose distinct from a common law tort action’ ***.” Supra ¶ 15.\n\n   I bolster my opinion with the submission that violating the Human Rights Act does not\n\n   comport with any formulation of reasonable policy or exercise of discretion that the Tort\n\n   Immunity Act is supposed to protect. The majority concludes that the Tort Immunity Act’s\n\n   definition of injury is the basis for its application to this cause of action. See supra ¶ 7. This\n\n   is incorrect. I submit that the relationship between plaintiff and defendant here is that of\n\n   employee and employer.          I also submit that plaintiff’s employment contract implicitly\n\n   included the Human Rights Act. Plaintiff’s right to be free from unlawful discrimination in\n\n   the “terms, privileges or conditions of employment” (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2014)) is\n\n   based on the fact that she is employed. As such, any injury in this case arose from a breach of\n\n   contract, not from a tort. The Tort Immunity Act explicitly states that it does not affect the\n\n   liability of a local public entity or public employee based on contract. See 745 ILCS\n\n   10/2-101(a) (West 2014); see also Village of Bloomingdale v. CDG Enterprises, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2167245\"><a href=\"/opinion/2167245/village-of-bloomingdale-v-cdg-enterprises/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n   <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 484, 500 (2001).
