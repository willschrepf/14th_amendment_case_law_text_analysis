Thibodeaux, Law Office of Lane D. Thibodeaux, Bryan, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Bill R. Turner, Brazos County Dist. Atty., Bryan, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before Chief Justice GRAY, Justice VANCE, and Justice REYNA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>LEAD OPINION</h2>\n<p>FELIPE REYNA, Justice.</p>\n<p>A jury found that M.P. had engaged in delinquent conduct by committing two counts of indecency with a child and one count of aggravated sexual assault of a child. The court committed M.P. to the Texas Youth Commission without a determinate sentence. M.P. contends in his sole issue that the court violated his right of confrontation under the federal and state constitutions, and particularly under <i>Crawford v. Washington</i><i>,</i> by admitting during the disposition phase a written report prepared by a juvenile probation officer which contains hearsay.</p>\n<p>During the disposition phase, the State offered a Juvenile Court Investigation Report prepared by M.P.'s juvenile probation officer, Sha'Vonne Brown-Lewis. The report contains general background information, M.P.'s referral history, the history of services provided by the juvenile department, a narrative of \"impressions\" reviewing M.P.'s history and briefly stating the probation officer's recommendation that M.P. be committed to TYC, and a concluding section reviewing the dispositional alternatives and providing a list of reasons TYC is the appropriate disposition.</p>\n<p>The report is supported by a collection of \"over thirty\" disciplinary referrals M.P. has received at different schools.<sup>[1]</sup> These referrals largely consist of brief narratives prepared by the teachers who made the referrals describing the conduct and the actions taken. Some referrals include witness statements. Others include documentary evidence.</p>\n<p>M.P. objected when the State offered the report in evidence on the basis that \"information both contained in the report and, frankly, the totality of Ms. Brown's testimony\" violate <i>Crawford v. Washington</i> and the confrontation clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Counsel specifically identified Brown-Lewis's references to M.P.'s various referrals as a matter of concern.</p>\n<p>After taking the matter under advisement, the court advised the parties that it would overrule the objection based on the reasoning of Indiana's Fourth District Court of Appeals in <i>C.C. v. State.</i> 826 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> N.E.2d 106 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). The court followed the recommendation of Brown-Lewis and committed M.P. to TYC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Preservation</h2>\n<p>The State contends that M.P. did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review because he failed to identify for the trial court the particular portions of the report which he considered to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p>To preserve a complaint for appellate review, Rule of Evidence 103(a)(1) requires \"a timely objection . . . stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.\" TEX.R. EVID. 103(a)(1); <i>see also</i> TEX.R.APP. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A). Stated another way, a \"timely\" and \"specific\" objection is required. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Helton,</i> 133 S.W.3d 245, 251 (Tex.2004); <i>Residential Dynamics, LLC v. Loveless,</i> 186 S.W.3d 192, 195 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2006, no pet.).</p>\n<p>Before and since the adoption of the Rules of Evidence in 1982,<sup>[2]</sup> Texas courts in civil appeals have held, \"A general objection to evidence as a whole, whether it be oral or documentary, which does not point out specifically the portion objected to, is properly overruled if any part of it is admissible.\" <i>Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. Haddad,</i> 142 Tex. 624, 180 S.W.2d 339, 341 (1944) (quoted by <i>Speier v. Webster College,</i> 616 S.W.2d 617, 619 (Tex.1981)); <i>accord </i><i>In re K.C.P.,</i> 142 S.W.3d 574, 583 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2004, no pet.); <i>Leaird's, Inc. v. Wrangler, Inc.,</i> 31 S.W.3d 688, 692 (Tex.App.-Waco 2000, pet. denied).<sup>[3]</sup> This principle is a particular application of the requirement that an objection be \"specific.\"</p>\n<p>However, as indicated by the plain language of Rule 103(a)(1), the specificity of an objection is less important when the basis for the objection is \"apparent from the context.\" TEX.R. EVID. 103(a)(1). Thus, Texas courts have found issues adequately preserved for appellate review even when the objections at issue did not meet the stringent requirements of <i>Brown &amp; Root</i> and its progeny. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re E.A.K.,</i> 192 S.W.3d 133, 147 n. 24 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied); <i>K.C.P.,</i> 142 S.W.3d at 578-79; <i>All Saints Episcopal Hosp. v. M.S.,</i> 791 S.W.2d 321, 323 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1990), <i>writ granted w.r.m.,</i> 801 S.W.2d 528 (Tex.1991) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Here, the comments of the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial court all indicate that the basis for M.P.'s objection was \"apparent from the context.\" <i>See</i> TEX.R. EVID. 103(a)(1); <i>E.A.K.,</i> 192 S.W.3d at 147 n. 24; <i>K.C.P.,</i> 142 S.W.3d at 578-79; <i>All Saints Episcopal Hosp.,</i> 791 S.W.2d at 323. Therefore, we reject the State's contention that M.P. failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> Due Process in Juvenile Proceedings</h2>\n<p>Juvenile delinquency proceedings must provide constitutionally mandated due process of law. <i>In re Gault,</i> 387 U.S. 1, 13, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1436, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967); <i>L.G.R. v. State,</i> 724 S.W.2d 775, 776 (Tex.1987); <i>Hidalgo v. State,</i> 983 S.W.2d 746, 751 (Tex.Crim.App.1999); <i>In re J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d 837, 841-42 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2000, pet. denied). However, the process due a juvenile offender does not equate to that due an adult offender in every instance. <i>See </i><i>Gault,</i> 387 U.S. at 14, 87 S.Ct. at 1436; <i>In re J.R.R.,</i> 696 S.W.2d 382, 383-84 (Tex.1985) (per curiam); <i>Hidalgo,</i> 983 S.W.2d at 751-52; <i>J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d at 842.</p>\n<p>The Court of Criminal Appeals has adopted a balancing test it distilled from eight foundational decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States \"to determine whether and to what degree\" a particular constitutional protection must be afforded a juvenile.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Lanes v. State,</i> 767 S.W.2d 789, 794 (Tex.Crim.App.1989); <i>accord </i><i>Hidalgo,</i> 983 S.W.2d at 751. This test requires an appellate court to \"balance[] the function that [the asserted] constitutional or procedural right serve[s] against its impact or degree of impairment on the unique processes of the juvenile court.\" <i>Lanes,</i> 767 S.W.2d at 794; <i>accord </i><i>Hidalgo,</i> 983 S.W.2d at 751-52; <i>J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d at 842-44; <i>S.D.G. v. State,</i> 936 S.W.2d 371, 378-79 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied).</p>\n<p>The Court recognized in Hidalgo that the justifications for affording fewer constitutional protections to juveniles than adults have lessened in recent years as the juvenile justice system has become more punitive than rehabilitative.</p>\n<blockquote>In adopting this balancing test this Court also announced a desire to \"dispel the antiquated and unrealistic resistance to procedural safeguards\" in the juvenile court system. We observed that due to the scarcity of treatment programs, professional training, and financial resources the juvenile system had become more punitive than rehabilitative. Rather than ignore these realities we chose to balance the \"aspirations of the juvenile court and the grim realities of the system.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Recent amendments to the Juvenile Justice Code change[d] juvenile adjudication and punishment, causing the \"grim realities\" to be even more salient. As this Court recently recognized in <i>Blake v. State,</i> 971 S.W.2d 451, 460 (Tex. Crim.App.1998), juveniles now face consequences similar to those faced by adults. Most apparent is the fact juveniles may now be subject to a forty-year term of imprisonment. <i>Blake</i> recognized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> some of the legislative changes making the juvenile system more punitive than rehabilitative:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]he legislature expanded the definitions of delinquent conduct, expanded the list of felony offenses that authorize criminal proceedings for juveniles over the age of fourteen, authorized confinement in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for various grades of felony and habitual felony conduct, categorized certain adjudications as \"final felony convictions\" that can be used as enhancements for repeat offenders, removed provisions forbidding the maintenance of centralized photograph and fingerprint records, repealed laws about sealing and destruction of juvenile records, and mandated the use of the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence and the evidentiary provisions of Chapter 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure instead of their civil counterparts for judicial proceedings involving juveniles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Blake,</i> 971 S.W.2d at 460 n. 28. These recent legislative changes continue to erode the original justifications for denying juveniles the same procedural protections as adults.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hidalgo,</i> 983 S.W.2d at 751-52 (other citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we must determine whether the disposition phase of a juvenile delinquency proceeding is the type of proceeding to which the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation<sup>[5]</sup> applies. If so, then we must examine the impact the application of that right would have on the juvenile justice system. <i>See id.</i> at 752; <i>J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d at 842.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Sixth Amendment Right of Confrontation</h2>\n<p>The right of confrontation is one of several rights provided by the Sixth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S. CONST. AMEND. VI.</p>\n<p>In <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> the Supreme Court of the United States held that the admission of hearsay evidence did not violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation if the declarant was unavailable to testify and the statement bore adequate indicia of reliability either because it: (1) fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, or (2) was shown to have particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). Twenty-four years later, the Court dramatically changed its interpretation of the right of confrontation in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). There, the Court discarded the indicia-of-reliability test of <i>Roberts,</i> at least for \"testimonial\" evidence, and held that the admission of hearsay violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior opportunity for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> cross-examination. <i>Id.</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p>Because of the sea change effected by <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> appellate courts have been called upon with some frequency to construe <i>Crawford</i> and to determine its application to particular issues. <i>See</i> Robert Wm. Best, <i>To Be or Not To Be Testimonial? That is the Question: 2004 Developments in the Sixth Amendment,</i> 2005 ARMY LAW. 65, 87 (2005) (\"Every week, at least twenty opinions are released that make a citation to <i>Crawford</i><i>.</i>\"). Before <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> little attention was paid to the issue of whether the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation even applied to the punishment phase of trial. Since <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> this issue has been addressed by a multitude of state and federal courts.</p>\n<p>At first blush, it would seem that this question could be promptly resolved by determining whether the punishment phase of trial is part of a \"criminal prosecution,\" because the Sixth Amendment (and ostensibly each of its guarantees), on its face, applies to \"all criminal prosecutions.\" However, the divergence of appellate decisions on this issue leads to the conclusion that the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment do not apply with equal force at every stage of a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>For example, in <i>Mempa v. Rhay</i> the Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel during the punishment phase because this right applies \"at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected.\" 389 U.S. 128, 134, 88 S.Ct. 254, 256-57, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967).</p>\n<p>In <i>Estelle v. Smith,</i> the Court construed the Sixth Amendment right to counsel quite broadly, beyond the trial on the merits. 451 U.S. 454, 470, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 1876, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote>It is central to [the Sixth Amendment] principle that in addition to counsel's presence at trial, the accused is guaranteed that he need not stand alone against the State at any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Wade,</i> 388 U.S. 218, 226, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1932, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967)).</p>\n<p>Conversely, the Court has construed the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial more narrowly. Thus, the Court has held that there is no right to jury trial for a petty offense, defined as one in which the punishment assessed is no more than six months. <i>Lewis v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 322, 325-26, 116 S.Ct. 2163, 2166-67, 135 L.Ed.2d 590 (1996) (citing <i>Duncan v. Louisiana,</i> 391 U.S. 145, 159, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1453, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968)).</p>\n<p>The Court has also held on several occasions that there is no Sixth Amendment right to have a jury assess punishment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Morgan v. Illinois,</i> 504 U.S. 719, 725-26, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 2228, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992); <i>Spaziano v. Florida,</i> 468 U.S. 447, 464, 104 S.Ct. 3154, 3164, 82 L.Ed.2d 340 (1984); <i>accord </i><i>Barrow v. State,</i> 207 S.W.3d 377, 380 (Tex.Crim.App.2006).</p>\n<p>In <i>Apprendi</i><i> v. New Jersey</i> and its progeny however, the Court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial does extend to the punishment phase insofar as the State may seek imposition of a sentence on the basis of findings beyond those \"reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\" <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 232, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (quoting <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)); <i>see also </i><i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 602, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 2439-40, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> (2002); <i>Apprendi v.

Allen,</i> 397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) (emphasis added) (citing <i>Lewis v. United States,</i> 146 U.S. 370, 374-75, 13 S.Ct. 136, 137, 36 L.Ed. 1011 (1892)) (\"Out of abundant tenderness for the right secured to the accused by our constitution to be confronted by the witnesses against him, and to be heard by himself or counsel, our court has gone a step further, and held that it must be shown by the record that the accused was present in court pending the trial.\");<sup>[6]</sup><i>accord </i><i>Garcia v.

State,</i> 586 S.W.2d 553, 556 (Tex.Crim.App.1979) (\"within the scope of the right of confrontation is the absolute requirement that a criminal defendant who is threatened with loss of liberty be physically present at <i>all phases</i> of proceedings against him\") (emphasis added); <i>Kessel v.

(juvenile \"has the same constitutional right to be present at the proceedings as a criminal defendant has\").</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Kessel</i> the Fourteenth Court of Appeals reversed a defendant's punishment where the trial court excluded the defendant from the courtroom during the punishment phase. <i>See </i><i>Kessel,</i> 161 S.W.3d at 47-49. And in <i>Garcia,</i> the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the defendant's conviction because he did not speak English and no interpreter had been appointed to translate the proceedings for him. <i>See </i><i>Garcia,</i> 149 S.W.3d at 145-46; <i>see also </i><i>Baltierra,</i> 586 S.W.2d at 559; <i>Miller v. State,</i> 177 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.).</p>\n<p>From these decisions we conclude that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation applies in some, but not all, respects to the punishment phase of an adult criminal trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Texas Decisions</h2>\n<p>No Texas court has expressly determined whether the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation applies during the punishment phase of an adult criminal trial or the disposition phase of a juvenile delinquency proceeding. <i>Cf. </i><i>Young v. State,</i> No. 02-04-501-CR, 2005 WL 3008442, at *1, 2005 Tex.App. LEXIS 9498, at *3-4 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth Nov. 10, 2005, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (\"We believe the right to counsel applies even at punishment in a bench trial. And until a higher court instructs us to the contrary, we shall apply the Sixth Amendment in its entirety, even to bench trials.\"). Rather, because the Court of Criminal Appeals and six intermediate courts of appeals have addressed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*106</span> the merits of claims that the right of confrontation was violated at punishment (or have found those claims waived by a failure to object), these courts have at least implicitly concluded that there is a Sixth Amendment right of confrontation at punishment.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In similar fashion, the Eastland Court of Appeals has implicitly concluded that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation applies during a hearing on a motion to modify a juvenile disposition when that court addressed the merits of the appellant's confrontation complaint. <i>See </i><i>In re J.R.L.G.,</i> No. 11-05-002-CV, 2006 WL 1098944, at *1-2, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 3344, at *2-6 (Tex.App.-Eastland Apr. 27, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.).</p>\n<p>Conversely, this Court and three others have concluded that a juvenile has no right of confrontation at a discretionary transfer hearing. <i>See </i><i>In re S.M.,</i> 207 S.W.3d 421, 425 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2006, pet. filed); <i>In re D.L.,</i> 198 S.W.3d 228, 229-30 (Tex.

State,</i> 120 P.3d 1069, 1072 (Alaska Ct.App. 2005) (\"a judge who is making findings of fact at sentencing proceedings can rely on out-of-court statements described in the pre-sentence report for proof of the matters asserted, unless the defendant offers a testimonial denial of those statements and submits to cross-examination, in which case the State must support its assertions with live testimony.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Sixth Amendment Summary</h2>\n<p>There is an indisputable Sixth Amendment right to counsel during the punishment phase and an indisputable right to be present during the punishment phase, the latter of which is a part of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. However, there is only a limited Sixth Amendment right to a jury during the punishment phase under <i>Apprendi</i> at its progeny. And most state and federal courts which have directly addressed the issue have concluded that there is no Sixth Amendment right of confrontation at sentencing.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Court of Criminal Appeals and a significant number of the intermediate appellate courts in Texas have at least implicitly concluded that a defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*108</span> has a Sixth Amendment right of confrontation at sentencing by addressing the merits of such claims or concluding that such claims were waived.</p>\n<p>Here, because this is a juvenile proceeding, we need not determine the precise parameters of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the punishment phase of an adult criminal trial. We do conclude, however, that at a minimum an adult criminal defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at sentencing: (1) in cases in which the State seeks imposition of a sentence on the basis of findings beyond those \"reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant\"; <i>see </i><i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 232, 125 S.Ct. at 749; <i>McGill,</i> 140 P.3d at 942; and (2) whenever the State calls a witness to testify at punishment. <i>See </i><i>Allen,</i> 397 U.S. at 338, 90 S.Ct. at 1058; <i>Garcia,</i> 149 S.W.3d at 140; <i>Baltierra,</i> 586 S.W.2d at 556; <i>Kessel,</i> 161 S.W.3d at 45; <i>C.T.C.,</i> 2 S.W.3d at 410.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Impact on Juvenile Proceedings</h2>\n<p>Having determined that there is at least a limited Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the punishment phase of an adult criminal trial, we now examine the impact the application of that right would have on the juvenile justice system. <i>See </i><i>Hidalgo,</i> 983 S.W.2d at 752; <i>J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d at 842.</p>\n<p>The Texas juvenile justice system requires courts to balance the need for public safety and punishment for criminal conduct with the medical, educational and rehabilitative needs and the best interests of the juvenile delinquent, while simultaneously ensuring that his \"constitutional and other legal rights\" are protected. <i>See</i> TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 51.01 (Vernon 2002). Among other purposes, the juvenile justice system is supposed to:</p>\n<blockquote> provide treatment, training, and rehabilitation that emphasizes the accountability and responsibility of both the parent and the child for the child's conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote> provide for the care, the protection, and the wholesome moral, mental, and physical development of children coming within its provisions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote> achieve the foregoing purposes in a family environment whenever possible, separating the child from the child's parents only when necessary for the child's welfare or in the interest of public safety and when a child is removed from the child's family, to give the child the care that should be provided by parents.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 51.01(2)(C), (3), (5).</p>\n<p>There appears to be only one potential fact issue to be determined during the disposition phase of a juvenile proceeding which may permit a disposition more severe than authorized by findings \"reflected in the jury verdict [from the adjudication phase].\"<sup>[11]</sup><i>See </i><i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 232, 125 S.Ct. at 749. That issue is whether the juvenile engaged in \"habitual felony conduct.\" <i>See</i> TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 54.04(m) (Vernon Supp.2006).<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> Nevertheless, under <i>Apprendi</i> and its progeny, a finding that a juvenile engaged in \"habitual felony conduct\" is nothing more than a finding that the juvenile has been previously and sequentially adjudicated of at least two prior felonies. Such a finding does not invoke the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial recognized in <i>Apprendi</i><i>. See</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (\"<i>Other than the fact of a prior conviction,</i> any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Because there are no findings to be made in the disposition phase which would invoke the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial recognized by <i>Apprendi</i> and its progeny and because of the importance of effectively addressing the medical, educational and rehabilitative needs and the best interests of the juvenile delinquent as recognized by the Juvenile Justice Code, we conclude that a juvenile has no Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the disposition phase. <i>See </i><i>C.C.,</i> 826 N.E.2d at 111; <i>Romeo C.,</i> 40 Cal.Rptr.2d at 89-91. Such a conclusion preserves the flexibility inherent in the design of the juvenile justice system for ensuring that the needs of each child are adequately addressed in the disposition phase.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Juvenile Justice Code expressly recognizes that a juvenile must be provided a \"fair hearing\" and his or her \"constitutional and other legal rights\" must be \"recognized and enforced.\" TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 51.01(6). Therefore, we hold that a juvenile has a limited right of confrontation under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than under the Sixth Amendment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Gagnon,</i> 411 U.S. at 782-86, 93 S.Ct. at 1760-62; <i>Morrissey,</i> 408 U.S. at 487-89, 92 S.Ct. at 2603-04; <i>Diaz,</i> 172 S.W.3d at 670-71; <i>Smart,</i> 153 S.W.3d at 121.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Due Process Right of Confrontation</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in <i>Morrissey</i> explained that this \"process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\" 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604; <i>accord </i><i>Diaz,</i> 172 S.W.3d at 670-71; <i>Smart,</i> 153 S.W.3d at 121.

Instead, the due process right of confrontation described in <i>Gagnon</i> applies. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>People v. Johnson,</i> 121 Cal.App.4th 1409, 18 Cal.Rptr.3d 230, 232 (2004); <i>People v.

Thus, the trial court must weigh the defendant's interest in confronting and cross-examining an adverse witness against the State's interest in not having to produce that witness, \"particularly focusing on the indicia of reliability of the hearsay offered.\" <i>Taylor,</i> 957 S.W.2d at 46 (citing <i>United States v. McCormick,</i> 54 F.3d 214 (5th Cir.1995)) (other citations omitted). This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis. <i>Taylor,</i> 957 S.W.2d at 46; <i>see also </i><i>Gagnon,</i> 411 U.S. at 788-91, 93 S.Ct. at 1763-64; <i>United States v.

Klincar,</i> 759 F.Supp. 425, 429 (N.D.Ill.1991).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Texas Constitution</h2>\n<p>M.P. also contends that the admission of the juvenile probation officer's report violated his right of confrontation under article I, section 10 of the Texas Constitution.</p>\n<p>Article I, section 10 provides in pertinent part, \"In all criminal prosecutions the accused . . . shall be confronted by the witnesses against him and shall have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\" TEX. CONST. art. I, § 10.</p>\n<p>Although M.P. observes some textual differences between this provision and the Sixth Amendment, he does not cite any authority which directly supports a proposition that the right of confrontation under the Texas Constitution varies in any appreciable manner from that provided in the Sixth Amendment. Rather, Texas courts have consistently interpreted these provisions as providing the same protection. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ex parte Johnson,</i> 654 S.W.2d 415, 421 (Tex.1983) (orig. proceeding); <i>Lagrone v. State,</i> 942 S.W.2d 602, 614 (Tex.Crim.App.1997); <i>Gomez v.

Rondeau,</i> 430 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 382 F.3d 840, 844-45 (8th Cir. 2004); <i>Barnes v.

Here, the trial court erred because it failed to conduct this balancing inquiry. We must determine whether this error requires reversal. <i>See </i><i>In re D.I.B.,</i> 988 S.W.2d 753, 758-59 (Tex.1999).</p>\n<p>According to the Juvenile Justice Code, \"[t]he requirements governing an appeal are as in civil cases generally.\" TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 56.01(b) (Vernon Supp.2006). Most courts which have discussed the appropriate harm analysis have concluded that the harm analysis applicable in civil appeals (Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1) applies to a juvenile delinquency appeal unless the appellant received a determinate sentence. <i>See </i><i>In re J.H.,</i> 150 S.W.3d 477, 485 (Tex.App.-Austin 2004, pet. denied); <i>In re D.V.,</i> 955 S.W.2d 379, 380 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1997, no pet.); <i>In re D.Z.,</i> 869 S.W.2d 561, 565-66 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1993, writ denied); <i>but cf. </i><i>In re L.R.,</i> 84 S.W.3d 701, 707 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (expressly declining to decide what harm analysis applies for a case involving \"non-determinate sentencing\"). Because the court did not impose a determinate sentence, we will apply the harm analysis of Rule 44.1.</p>\n<p>Rule 44.1(a) permits reversal for error only if the error: \"(1) probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment; or (2) probably prevented the appellant from properly presenting the case to the court of appeals.\" TEX.R.APP. P. 44.1(a).</p>\n<p>Though the issue has apparently not been decided in Texas, numerous courts in other jurisdictions have found such error harmless in cases in which the hearsay evidence was sufficiently reliable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Kelley,</i> 446 F.3d 688, 692 (7th Cir.2006) (arresting officer's testimony and offense report); <i>United States v. Hall,</i> 419 F.3d 980, 987 (9th Cir.2005) (\"Hall's interest in excluding [medical records and statements made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment] was thus weak\"); <i>United States v.

FAM.CODE ANN. § 54.04(b) (Vernon Supp.2006). Thus, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> Legislature has determined that such reports have some degree of reliability for purposes of determining the appropriate disposition in a particular case. In fact, such reports have been required for the disposition phase of juvenile delinquency proceedings since at least 1973.<sup>[13]</sup><i>See</i> Act of May 25, 1973, 63d Leg., R.S., ch. 544, § 154.04(b), 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1460, 1478. Our research has disclosed at least one appellate decision which has addressed the reliability of such reports. <i>See In re JV-512016,</i> 186 Ariz. 414, 923 P.2d 880 (Ct.App.1996). There, the court concluded that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by accepting (1) hearsay statements regarding extraneous offenses contained in the juvenile probation report and (2) the juvenile's admissions to a clinician that he had committed these extraneous offenses contained in the clinician's report \"as reliable sources of dispositional fact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 884.</p>\n<p>The report required by section 54.04(b) is very similar to the presentence investigation report required in most felony cases. <i>See</i> TEX.CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.12, § 9 (Vernon 2006). Courts have long held that such reports have sufficient indicia of reliability to aid a court in determining the appropriate sentence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Marin-Cuevas,</i> 147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Montoya-Ortiz,</i> 7 F.3d 1171, 1180 (5th Cir. 1993); <i>People v.

TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 54.04(b). To exercise the limited right of confrontation we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> have recognized herein, a juvenile may subpoena any necessary witnesses to challenge the accuracy of any information contained in any reports to be offered under section 54.04(b). <i>See </i><i>In re M.R.,</i> 5 S.W.3d 879, 881-82 &amp; n. 3 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1999, pet. denied) (describing limited right of confrontation available for transfer/release hearing under section 54.11 of the Juvenile Justice Code).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The juvenile probation officer's report admitted during the disposition phase of M.P.'s trial contains sufficient indicia of reliability to allow us to conclude that the court's failure to conduct the balancing test required for the admission of hearsay evidence without violating the limited due process right of confrontation described in <i>Morrissey</i> and <i>Gagnon</i> did not \"probably cause the rendition of an improper judgment.\" <i>See </i><i>Kelley,</i> 446 F.3d at 692; <i>Hall,</i> 419 F.3d at 987; <i>Morris,</i> 140 Fed.Appx. at 142-43; <i>Schwarz,</i> 250 Wis.2d 214, ¶ 22, 250 Wis.2d 214, 640 N.W.2d 527, ¶ 22; <i>see also </i><i>Aspinall,</i> 389 F.3d at 344.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we overrule M.P.'s sole issue and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice GRAY issuing a separate opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice VANCE, dissenting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>TOM GRAY, Chief Justice.</p>\n<p>A jury found that M.P. had engaged in delinquent conduct by committing two counts of indecency with a child and one count of aggravated sexual assault of a child. The court committed M.P. to the Texas Youth Commission without a determinate sentence. M.P. contends in his sole issue that the court violated his right of confrontation under the federal and state constitutions, and particularly under <i>Crawford v. Washington</i><i>,</i> by admitting during the disposition phase a written report prepared by a juvenile probation officer which contains hearsay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>During the disposition phase, the State offered a Juvenile Court Investigation Report prepared by M.P.'s juvenile probation officer, Sha'Vonne Brown-Lewis. The report contains general background information, M.P.'s referral history, the history of services provided by the juvenile department, a narrative of \"impressions\" reviewing M.P.'s history and briefly stating the probation officer's recommendation that M.P. be committed to TYC, and a concluding section reviewing the dispositional alternatives and providing a list of reasons TYC is the appropriate disposition.</p>\n<p>The report is supported by a collection of \"over thirty\" disciplinary referrals M.P. has received at different schools. These referrals largely consist of brief narratives prepared by the teachers who made the referrals describing the conduct and the actions taken. Some referrals include witness statements. Others include documentary evidence.</p>\n<p>M.P. objected when the State offered the report in evidence on the basis that \"information both contained in the report and, frankly, the totality of Ms. Brown's testimony\" violate <i>Crawford v. Washington</i> and the Confrontation Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Counsel identified Brown-Lewis's references to M.P.'s various referrals as a matter of concern.</p>\n<p>After taking the matter under advisement, the court advised the parties that it would overrule the objection based on the reasoning of Indiana's Fourth District Court of Appeals in <i>C.C. v. State,</i> 826 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> N.E.2d 106 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). The court followed the recommendation of Brown-Lewis and committed M.P. to TYC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PRESERVATION</h2>\n<p>The State contends that M.P. did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review because he failed to identify for the trial court the particular portions of the report which he considered to be inadmissible. We have previously decided this same issue in the State's favor. <i>In re L.D.T.,</i> No. 10-05-00016-CV, 2006 WL 301073, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 1082 (Tex. App.-Waco Feb. 8, 2006, pet. denied) (mem. op.).</p>\n<p>When an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible evidence, the objection must specifically refer to the challenged material to apprise the trial court of the precise objection. <i>Sonnier v. State,</i> 913 S.W.2d 511, 518 (Tex.Crim.App.1995). The trial court should never be required to sift through challenged evidenced to segregate admissible evidence from excludable evidence. <i>Jones v. State,</i> 843 S.W.2d 487, 492 (Tex.Crim.App.1992), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Maxwell v. State,</i> 48 S.W.3d 196 (Tex.Crim.App.2001). In those instances where an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible evidence, a trial court may \"safely admit it all or exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is, will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer or objection.\" <i>Id.; cf. </i><i>In re D.S.,</i> 921 S.W.2d 383, 387-388 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1996, writ dism'd w.o.j.).</p>\n<p>Here, the comments of the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial court all indicate that, at best, only the general nature of M.P.'s objection was understood. But the reason for the specificity requirement cannot be met simply because the parties and the trial court have a meeting of the minds about the general subject matter of the objection. Beyond the need for the objection to direct the trial court's attention to the general issue, an objection that is sufficiently specific will inform the court of the specific evidence that is objectionable, not generally to a class of objectionable evidence.</p>\n<p>This case presents a good example of why a specific objection is necessary and why a general objection cannot be tolerated. The defendant's objection was to \"the totality of Ms. Brown's testimony.\" But there is no credible argument that all of Ms. Brown's testimony violated <i>Crawford</i> and the Confrontation Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Before testimony regarding an out of court statement being offered at trial can be excluded based on a Confrontation Clause objection, the specific statement and the circumstances of the making of the statement must be evaluated. Because M.P. did not articulate an objection to specific statements, but rather made a general objection to the entirety of Ms. Brown's testimony, the general global Confrontation Clause objection did not preserve anything for appellate review. If M.P. had taken the time to identify specific portions of Ms. Brown's report, or portions of the referrals that were believed to be Confrontation Clause violations if admitted, the trial court, and this Court, could then focus on the law relevant to the allegedly objectionable statements. As it is, however, we have this vast volume of information, including the testimony of a live witness, which has been objected to as a violation of the Confrontation Clause. If the witness is on the stand to give their testimony, including the opinions of that witness, it does not generally violate the Confrontation Clauseit may be objectionable under other rules of evidence such as Rule 702, lack of personal knowledge, hearsay, etc., but not the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> When there is no clear objection to specific evidence being offered, reviewing the alleged error, for the lack of a more graphic example, is like trying to nail Jell-O to a tree. It is an amorphous concept that can change based upon minute variations in fact patterns and circumstances. Unsatisfied with the enormity of the problem facing the trial court as described by counsel for M.P., Justice Reyna even doubles the estimate of the number of disciplinary referrals attached to the report (<i>see</i> footnote 1, Reyna Op.).</p>\n<p>Until the parties get into the contents of these reports, and by that I mean the specific statements being made in these reports, we cannot even begin a proper <i>Crawford</i> analysis. The attempted blanket objection made by trial counsel failed to direct the trial court's attention to any specific statement contained in the numerous referral reports that counsel might have considered \"testimonial.\"</p>\n<p>The problem of letting the general objection suffice for preservation of the Confrontation Clause issue as to specific statements is aptly demonstrated by Justice Reyna's opinion. After concluding that the issue was preserved for review, the opinion conducts a 20-page meandering tour of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, conducts a stop-gap analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment, and brushes past the Texas Constitution and a harm analysis on its way to incidental \"holdings\" that have no relevance to this appeal. This is primarily because we are not reviewing any specific statement but rather a general ill-defined topic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Based upon the foregoing, because the objection was not sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appellate review, M.P.'s sole issue is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>Justice VANCE dissenting.</p>\n<p>Justice REYNA issuing a separate opinion.</p>\n<p>BILL VANCE, Justice, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice Reyna's preservation determination and his application of the due process right of confrontation,<sup>[1]</sup> but I respectfully disagree with the blanket conclusion that a juvenile has no Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the disposition phase.</p>\n<p>In <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court resuscitated the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. As Justice Reyna recognizes, Texas courts have applied it in the punishment phase. <i>Ante</i> at 105-06; <i>e.g., </i><i>Russeau v. State,</i> 171 S.W.3d 871, 880-81 (Tex.Crim.App.2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2982, 165 L.Ed.2d 989 (2006) (applying <i>Crawford</i> to introduction of prison incident and disciplinary reports and concluding that their introduction violated Confrontation Clause). And at least one other state's highest court has expressly applied <i>Crawford</i> to the punishment phase. <i>See </i><i>Rodgers v. State,</i> 948 So.2d 655, 663 (2006).</p>\n<p>I would extend those holdings to a juvenile adjudication's disposition phase.<sup>[2]</sup> The juvenile system has \"become more punitive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> than rehabilitative.\" <i>Hidalgo v. State,</i> 983 S.W.2d 746, 751 (Tex.Crim.App.1999). Juveniles now face consequences similar to adults; for example, they can be subject to a forty-year term of imprisonment. <i>Id.</i> (citing TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 54.04(d)(3)(A)). As a result, I believe that the balancing test employed to determine the constitutional protection afforded to a juvenile in a disposition hearing should tilt toward providing constitutional protections such as the Sixth Amendment confrontation right articulated in <i>Crawford</i><i>:</i></p>\n<blockquote>The juvenile is guaranteed the same constitutional rights as an adult in a criminal proceeding because a juvenile-delinquency proceeding seeks to deprive the juvenile of his liberty. <i>In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 359, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1070, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). Neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone. <i>In re Gault,</i> 387 U.S. at 13, 87 S.Ct. at 1436.</blockquote>\n<p><i>State v. C.J.F.,</i> 183 S.W.3d 841, 847 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (citations omitted); <i>see </i><i>In re J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d 837, 841-44 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2000, pet. denied) (applying Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to juvenile disposition phase); <i>see also </i><i>In re S.M.,</i> 207 S.W.3d 421, 425-26 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2006, no pet. h.) (Livingston, J., concurring) (noting conflict between Family Code section 54.11(d) and <i>Crawford</i><i>'s</i> Confrontation Clause protections and \"the potential magnitude of the result of a transfer hearing with the lack of protection for a juvenile's right to cross-examine the witnesses who testify against him via untested written reports\").</p>\n<p>Because I believe that a juvenile should be afforded the Sixth Amendment confrontation right in the disposition phase and that the disciplinary referrals containing teachers' narratives are testimonial statements (and thus indistinguishable from the incident and disciplinary reports in <i>Russeau</i>), I would find a Confrontation Clause violation by the trial court's admission of the disciplinary referrals and then proceed to a Confrontation-Clause error harm analysis.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>McClenton v.

If evidence is offered and challenged which contains some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is, will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer or objection.</p>\n<p><i>Barnes v.

The court committed M.P. to the Texas Youth Commission without a determinate sentence. M.P. contends in his sole issue that the court violated his right of confrontation under the federal and state constitutions, and particularly under <i>Crawford v. Washington</i><i>,</i> by admitting during the disposition phase a written report prepared by a juvenile probation officer which contains hearsay.</p>\n<p>During the disposition phase, the State offered a Juvenile Court Investigation Report prepared by M.P.'s juvenile probation officer, Sha'Vonne Brown-Lewis. The report contains general background information, M.P.'s referral history, the history of services provided by the juvenile department, a narrative of \"impressions\" reviewing M.P.'s history and briefly stating the probation officer's recommendation that M.P. be committed to TYC, and a concluding section reviewing the dispositional alternatives and providing a list of reasons TYC is the appropriate disposition.</p>\n<p>The report is supported by a collection of \"over thirty\" disciplinary referrals M.P. has received at different schools.<sup>[1]</sup> These referrals largely consist of brief narratives prepared by the teachers who made the referrals describing the conduct and the actions taken. Some referrals include witness statements. Others include documentary evidence.</p>\n<p>M.P. objected when the State offered the report in evidence on the basis that \"information both contained in the report and, frankly, the totality of Ms. Brown's testimony\" violate <i>Crawford v. Washington</i> and the confrontation clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Counsel specifically identified Brown-Lewis's references to M.P.'s various referrals as a matter of concern.</p>\n<p>After taking the matter under advisement, the court advised the parties that it would overrule the objection based on the reasoning of Indiana's Fourth District Court of Appeals in <i>C.C. v. State.</i> 826 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> N.E.2d 106 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). The court followed the recommendation of Brown-Lewis and committed M.P. to TYC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Preservation</h2>\n<p>The State contends that M.P. did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review because he failed to identify for the trial court the particular portions of the report which he considered to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p>To preserve a complaint for appellate review, Rule of Evidence 103(a)(1) requires \"a timely objection . . . stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.\" TEX.R. EVID. 103(a)(1); <i>see also</i> TEX.R.APP. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A). Stated another way, a \"timely\" and \"specific\" objection is required. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kerr-McGee Corp. v.

There, the Court discarded the indicia-of-reliability test of <i>Roberts,</i> at least for \"testimonial\" evidence, and held that the admission of hearsay violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior opportunity for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> cross-examination. <i>Id.</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p>Because of the sea change effected by <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> appellate courts have been called upon with some frequency to construe <i>Crawford</i> and to determine its application to particular issues. <i>See</i> Robert Wm.

Before <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> little attention was paid to the issue of whether the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation even applied to the punishment phase of trial. Since <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> this issue has been addressed by a multitude of state and federal courts.</p>\n<p>At first blush, it would seem that this question could be promptly resolved by determining whether the punishment phase of trial is part of a \"criminal prosecution,\" because the Sixth Amendment (and ostensibly each of its guarantees), on its face, applies to \"all criminal prosecutions.\" However, the divergence of appellate decisions on this issue leads to the conclusion that the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment do not apply with equal force at every stage of a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>For example, in <i>Mempa v. Rhay</i> the Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel during the punishment phase because this right applies \"at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107542\"><a href=\"/opinion/107542/mempa-v-rhay/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 134, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107542\"><a href=\"/opinion/107542/mempa-v-rhay/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, there is only a limited Sixth Amendment right to a jury during the punishment phase under <i>Apprendi</i> at its progeny. And most state and federal courts which have directly addressed the issue have concluded that there is no Sixth Amendment right of confrontation at sentencing.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Court of Criminal Appeals and a significant number of the intermediate appellate courts in Texas have at least implicitly concluded that a defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*108</span> has a Sixth Amendment right of confrontation at sentencing by addressing the merits of such claims or concluding that such claims were waived.</p>\n<p>Here, because this is a juvenile proceeding, we need not determine the precise parameters of the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the punishment phase of an adult criminal trial. We do conclude, however, that at a minimum an adult criminal defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at sentencing: (1) in cases in which the State seeks imposition of a sentence on the basis of findings beyond those \"reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant\"; <i>see </i><i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 232, 125 S.Ct. at 749; <i>McGill,</i> 140 P.3d at 942; and (2) whenever the State calls a witness to testify at punishment. <i>See </i><i>Allen,</i> 397 U.S. at 338, 90 S.Ct. at 1058; <i>Garcia,</i> 149 S.W.3d at 140; <i>Baltierra,</i> 586 S.W.2d at 556; <i>Kessel,</i> 161 S.W.3d at 45; <i>C.T.C.,</i> 2 S.W.3d at 410.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Impact on Juvenile Proceedings</h2>\n<p>Having determined that there is at least a limited Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the punishment phase of an adult criminal trial, we now examine the impact the application of that right would have on the juvenile justice system. <i>See </i><i>Hidalgo,</i> 983 S.W.2d at 752; <i>J.S.S.,</i> 20 S.W.3d at 842.</p>\n<p>The Texas juvenile justice system requires courts to balance the need for public safety and punishment for criminal conduct with the medical, educational and rehabilitative needs and the best interests of the juvenile delinquent, while simultaneously ensuring that his \"constitutional and other legal rights\" are protected. <i>See</i> TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 51.01 (Vernon 2002). Among other purposes, the juvenile justice system is supposed to:</p>\n<blockquote> provide treatment, training, and rehabilitation that emphasizes the accountability and responsibility of both the parent and the child for the child's conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote> provide for the care, the protection, and the wholesome moral, mental, and physical development of children coming within its provisions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote> achieve the foregoing purposes in a family environment whenever possible, separating the child from the child's parents only when necessary for the child's welfare or in the interest of public safety and when a child is removed from the child's family, to give the child the care that should be provided by parents.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 51.01(2)(C), (3), (5).</p>\n<p>There appears to be only one potential fact issue to be determined during the disposition phase of a juvenile proceeding which may permit a disposition more severe than authorized by findings \"reflected in the jury verdict [from the adjudication phase].\"<sup>[11]</sup><i>See </i><i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 232, 125 S.Ct. at 749. That issue is whether the juvenile engaged in \"habitual felony conduct.\" <i>See</i> TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 54.04(m) (Vernon Supp.2006).<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> Nevertheless, under <i>Apprendi</i> and its progeny, a finding that a juvenile engaged in \"habitual felony conduct\" is nothing more than a finding that the juvenile has been previously and sequentially adjudicated of at least two prior felonies. Such a finding does not invoke the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial recognized in <i>Apprendi</i><i>. See</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (\"<i>Other than the fact of a prior conviction,</i> any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Because there are no findings to be made in the disposition phase which would invoke the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial recognized by <i>Apprendi</i> and its progeny and because of the importance of effectively addressing the medical, educational and rehabilitative needs and the best interests of the juvenile delinquent as recognized by the Juvenile Justice Code, we conclude that a juvenile has no Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the disposition phase. <i>See </i><i>C.C.,</i> 826 N.E.2d at 111; <i>Romeo C.,</i> 40 Cal.Rptr.2d at 89-91. Such a conclusion preserves the flexibility inherent in the design of the juvenile justice system for ensuring that the needs of each child are adequately addressed in the disposition phase.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Juvenile Justice Code expressly recognizes that a juvenile must be provided a \"fair hearing\" and his or her \"constitutional and other legal rights\" must be \"recognized and enforced.\" TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 51.01(6). Therefore, we hold that a juvenile has a limited right of confrontation under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than under the Sixth Amendment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Gagnon,</i> 411 U.S. at 782-86, 93 S.Ct. at 1760-62; <i>Morrissey,</i> 408 U.S. at 487-89, 92 S.Ct. at 2603-04; <i>Diaz,</i> 172 S.W.3d at 670-71; <i>Smart,</i> 153 S.W.3d at 121.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Due Process Right of Confrontation</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in <i>Morrissey</i> explained that this \"process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\" 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604; <i>accord </i><i>Diaz,</i> 172 S.W.3d at 670-71; <i>Smart,</i> 153 S.W.3d at 121. The Court discussed this due process right of confrontation in more detail in <i>Gagnon</i><i>.</i></p>\n<blockquote>An additional comment is warranted with respect to the rights to present witnesses and to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. Petitioner's greatest concern is with the difficulty and expense of procuring witnesses from perhaps thousands of miles away. While in some cases there is simply no adequate alternative to live testimony, we emphasize that we did not in <i>Morrissey</i> intend to prohibit use where appropriate of the conventional substitutes for live testimony, including affidavits, depositions, and documentary evidence. Nor did we intend to foreclose the States from holding both the preliminary and the final hearings at the place of violation or from developing other creative solutions to the practical difficulties of the <i>Morrissey</i> requirements.</blockquote>\n<p>411 U.S. at 782 n. 5, 93 S.Ct. at 1760 n. 5; <i>accord </i><i>Diaz,</i> 172 S.W.3d at 671.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> Therefore, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence regarding the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, and particularly <i>Crawford</i><i>,</i> has no application to the disposition phase of a juvenile delinquency proceeding. <i>See </i><i>Diaz,</i> 172 S.W.3d at 672; <i>Smart,</i> 153 S.W.3d at 120-21.

The court committed M.P. to the Texas Youth Commission without a determinate sentence. M.P. contends in his sole issue that the court violated his right of confrontation under the federal and state constitutions, and particularly under <i>Crawford v. Washington</i><i>,</i> by admitting during the disposition phase a written report prepared by a juvenile probation officer which contains hearsay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>During the disposition phase, the State offered a Juvenile Court Investigation Report prepared by M.P.'s juvenile probation officer, Sha'Vonne Brown-Lewis. The report contains general background information, M.P.'s referral history, the history of services provided by the juvenile department, a narrative of \"impressions\" reviewing M.P.'s history and briefly stating the probation officer's recommendation that M.P. be committed to TYC, and a concluding section reviewing the dispositional alternatives and providing a list of reasons TYC is the appropriate disposition.</p>\n<p>The report is supported by a collection of \"over thirty\" disciplinary referrals M.P. has received at different schools. These referrals largely consist of brief narratives prepared by the teachers who made the referrals describing the conduct and the actions taken. Some referrals include witness statements. Others include documentary evidence.</p>\n<p>M.P. objected when the State offered the report in evidence on the basis that \"information both contained in the report and, frankly, the totality of Ms. Brown's testimony\" violate <i>Crawford v. Washington</i> and the Confrontation Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Counsel identified Brown-Lewis's references to M.P.'s various referrals as a matter of concern.</p>\n<p>After taking the matter under advisement, the court advised the parties that it would overrule the objection based on the reasoning of Indiana's Fourth District Court of Appeals in <i>C.C. v. State,</i> 826 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> N.E.2d 106 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). The court followed the recommendation of Brown-Lewis and committed M.P. to TYC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PRESERVATION</h2>\n<p>The State contends that M.P. did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review because he failed to identify for the trial court the particular portions of the report which he considered to be inadmissible. We have previously decided this same issue in the State's favor. <i>In re L.D.T.,</i> No. 10-05-00016-CV, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">301073</span></span>, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 1082 (Tex. App.-Waco Feb. 8, 2006, pet. denied) (mem. op.).</p>\n<p>When an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible evidence, the objection must specifically refer to the challenged material to apprise the trial court of the precise objection. <i>Sonnier v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2405699\"><a href=\"/opinion/2405699/sonnier-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 518 (Tex.Crim.App.1995). The trial court should never be required to sift through challenged evidenced to segregate admissible evidence from excludable evidence. <i>Jones v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2364249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2364249/jones-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 492 (Tex.Crim.App.1992), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Maxwell v.

In those instances where an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible evidence, a trial court may \"safely admit it all or exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is, will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer or objection.\" <i>Id.; cf. </i><i>In re D.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1677539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1677539/matter-of-ds/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 387-388 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1996, writ dism'd w.o.j.).</p>\n<p>Here, the comments of the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial court all indicate that, at best, only the general nature of M.P.'s objection was understood. But the reason for the specificity requirement cannot be met simply because the parties and the trial court have a meeting of the minds about the general subject matter of the objection. Beyond the need for the objection to direct the trial court's attention to the general issue, an objection that is sufficiently specific will inform the court of the specific evidence that is objectionable, not generally to a class of objectionable evidence.</p>\n<p>This case presents a good example of why a specific objection is necessary and why a general objection cannot be tolerated. The defendant's objection was to \"the totality of Ms. Brown's testimony.\" But there is no credible argument that all of Ms. Brown's testimony violated <i>Crawford</i> and the Confrontation Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Before testimony regarding an out of court statement being offered at trial can be excluded based on a Confrontation Clause objection, the specific statement and the circumstances of the making of the statement must be evaluated. Because M.P. did not articulate an objection to specific statements, but rather made a general objection to the entirety of Ms. Brown's testimony, the general global Confrontation Clause objection did not preserve anything for appellate review. If M.P. had taken the time to identify specific portions of Ms. Brown's report, or portions of the referrals that were believed to be Confrontation Clause violations if admitted, the trial court, and this Court, could then focus on the law relevant to the allegedly objectionable statements. As it is, however, we have this vast volume of information, including the testimony of a live witness, which has been objected to as a violation of the Confrontation Clause. If the witness is on the stand to give their testimony, including the opinions of that witness, it does not generally violate the Confrontation Clauseit may be objectionable under other rules of evidence such as Rule 702, lack of personal knowledge, hearsay, etc., but not the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> When there is no clear objection to specific evidence being offered, reviewing the alleged error, for the lack of a more graphic example, is like trying to nail Jell-O to a tree. It is an amorphous concept that can change based upon minute variations in fact patterns and circumstances. Unsatisfied with the enormity of the problem facing the trial court as described by counsel for M.P., Justice Reyna even doubles the estimate of the number of disciplinary referrals attached to the report (<i>see</i> footnote 1, Reyna Op.).</p>\n<p>Until the parties get into the contents of these reports, and by that I mean the specific statements being made in these reports, we cannot even begin a proper <i>Crawford</i> analysis. The attempted blanket objection made by trial counsel failed to direct the trial court's attention to any specific statement contained in the numerous referral reports that counsel might have considered \"testimonial.\"</p>\n<p>The problem of letting the general objection suffice for preservation of the Confrontation Clause issue as to specific statements is aptly demonstrated by Justice Reyna's opinion. After concluding that the issue was preserved for review, the opinion conducts a 20-page meandering tour of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, conducts a stop-gap analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment, and brushes past the Texas Constitution and a harm analysis on its way to incidental \"holdings\" that have no relevance to this appeal. This is primarily because we are not reviewing any specific statement but rather a general ill-defined topic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Based upon the foregoing, because the objection was not sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appellate review, M.P.'s sole issue is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>Justice VANCE dissenting.</p>\n<p>Justice REYNA issuing a separate opinion.</p>\n<p>BILL VANCE, Justice, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice Reyna's preservation determination and his application of the due process right of confrontation,<sup>[1]</sup> but I respectfully disagree with the blanket conclusion that a juvenile has no Sixth Amendment right of confrontation during the disposition phase.</p>\n<p>In <i>Crawford v.
