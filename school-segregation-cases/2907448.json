Holmes, The National Legal\nFoundation, Virginia Beach, Virginia, for amicus curiae The\nNational Legal Foundation.\n\n\n                               OPINION\n\nMcKEOWN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   A Latin cross sits atop a prominent rock outcropping\nknown as “Sunrise Rock” in the Mojave National Preserve\n(“Preserve”). Our court previously held that the presence of\nthe cross in the Preserve—which consists of more than 90\npercent federally-owned land, including the land where the\ncross is situated—violates the Establishment Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution. Buono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543\n(9th Cir. 2004). We affirmed the district court’s judgment per-\nmanently enjoining the government “from permitting the dis-\nplay of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the\nMojave National Preserve.”\n\n   During the pendency of the first appeal, Congress enacted\na statute directing that the land on which the cross is situated\nbe transferred to a private organization in exchange for a par-\ncel of privately-owned land located elsewhere in the Preserve.\nSee Pub.L. No. 108-87, R. 12.1, 12.4 § 8121(a)-(f), 117 Stat.\n1100 (2003). That land exchange is already in progress and\nwould leave a little donut hole of land with a cross in the\nmidst of a vast federal preserve. The issue we address today\nis whether the land exchange violates the district court’s per-\nmanent injunction. We conclude that it does, and affirm the\ndistrict court’s order permanently enjoining the government\nfrom effectuating the land exchange and ordering the govern-\nment to comply with the original injunction.\n\n                             BACKGROUND1\n   1\n     Further background detail is found in the district court’s order and our\nprior opinion on the merits of the Establishment Clause challenge. See\ngenerally Buono v. Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (C.D. Cal. 2002)\n(“Buono I”); Buono, 371 F.3d 543 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Buono II”).\n\f11798                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nI.    THE MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE\n\n   The Preserve encompasses approximately 1.6 million acres,\nor 2,500 square miles, of primarily federally-owned land in\nthe Mojave Desert, located in Southeastern California. In\n1994, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) transferred\nthe land to the National Park Service (“NPS”); both the BLM\nand the NPS are federal agencies under the Department of the\nInterior (“DOI”). Within the Preserve, approximately 86,000\nacres of land are privately owned and 43,000 acres belong to\nthe State of California. Thus, slightly more than 90 percent of\nthe land in the Preserve is federally owned. The Preserve is\na “unit of the National Park System” and is given “statutory\nprotection as a national preserve.” 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-41,\n410aaa-42; id. § 1(c). The Preserve is under NPS jurisdiction\nand authority. Id. § 410aaa-46.\n\nII.   THE CROSS\n\n   The current incarnation of the cross atop Sunrise Rock is\nbetween five and eight feet tall and is constructed out of four-\ninch diameter metal pipes painted white. It is a Latin cross,\nmeaning that it has two arms, one horizontal and one vertical,\nat right angles to one another. It is undisputed that “[t]he Latin\ncross is the preeminent symbol of Christianity. It is exclu-\nsively a Christian symbol, and not a symbol of any other reli-\ngion.” Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 1205.\n\n   Historic records reflect that a wooden cross was built on\nthat location as early as 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars\n(“VFW”) as a memorial to veterans who died in World War\nI. Photographs depict the wooden cross and signs near it stat-\ning: “The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All\nWars,” and “Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of\nForegin [sic] Wars, Death Valley post 2884.” The wooden\nsigns are no longer present, and the original wooden cross,\nwhich is no longer standing, has been replaced by private par-\nties several times since 1934. The cross has been an intermit-\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                         11799\ntent gathering place for Easter religious services since as early\nas 1935, and regularly since 1984.\n\n   The current version of the cross was built by Henry San-\ndoz, a local resident, sometime in 1998. When NPS investi-\ngated the history of the cross, Sandoz explained that he drilled\nholes into Sunrise Rock to bolt the cross in place, making it\ndifficult to remove. Sandoz did not receive a permit from NPS\nto construct the cross.\n\n   Following Buono I’s injunction against display of the cross,\nthe cross has been covered by a plywood box. When uncov-\nered, the cross is visible from vehicles traveling on Cima\nRoad, which passes through the Preserve, from a distance of\napproximately 100 yards away. No sign indicates that the\ncross was or is intended to act as a memorial for war veterans.\n\nIII. LITIGATION OVER         THE   CROSS    AND THE    CONGRESSIONAL\nRESPONSE\n\n   The current controversy surrounding the cross surfaced in\n1999, when NPS received a request from an individual seek-\ning to build a “stupa” (a dome-shaped Buddhist shrine) on a\nrock outcropping at a trailhead located near the cross. NPS\ndenied that request, citing 36 C.F.R. § 2.62(a)2 as prohibiting\nthe installation of a memorial without authorization. A hand-\nwritten note on the denial letter warns that “[a]ny attempt to\nerect a stupa will be in violation of Federal Law and subject\nyou to citation and/or arrest.” The letter also indicates that\n“[c]urrently there is a cross on [a] rock outcrop located on\nNational Park Service lands. . . . It is our intention to have the\ncross removed.”\n  2\n    The regulation provides that: “The installation of a monument, memo-\nrial, tablet, structure, or other commemorative installation in a park area\nwithout the authorization of the Director is prohibited.” 36 C.F.R.\n§ 2.62(a).\n\f11800                   BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n   In 1999, NPS undertook a study of the history of the cross.\nNPS determined that neither the cross nor the property on\nwhich it is situated qualifies for inclusion in the National Reg-\nister of Historic Places. Specifically, NPS recognized that the\ncross itself “has been replaced many times and the plaque that\nonce accompanied it (even though it is not known if it is origi-\nnal) has been removed.” Also, the property does not qualify\nas an historical site because, among other things, “the site is\nused for religious purposes as well as commemoration.”\n\n   Following the announcement by NPS of its intention to\nremove the cross, the United States Congress passed a series\nof laws, described below, to preserve the Sunrise Rock cross.\nThe first piece of legislation, enacted in December 2000, pro-\nvided that no government funds could be used to remove the\ncross. See Pub. L. No. 106-554 § 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230\n(2000) (hereafter “§ 133”).3\n\n  A.    Buono I\n\n   Frank Buono4 filed suit in March 2001 against the Secre-\ntary of the DOI, the Regional Director of NPS, and the Super-\nintendent of the Preserve (collectively, “NPS” or\n“Defendants”). The district court concluded that the presence\nof the cross in the Preserve violates the Establishment Clause.\nSee Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 1215-17. In July 2002, the\ncourt entered a permanent injunction ordering that the “De-\nfendants, their employees, agents, and those in active concert\nwith Defendants, are hereby permanently restrained and\n  3\n     “None of the funds in this or any other Act may be used by the Secre-\ntary of the Interior to remove the five-foot-tall white cross located within\nthe boundary of the Mojave National Preserve in southern California first\nerected in 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars along Cima Road\napproximately 11 miles south of Interstate 15.” § 113 (emphasis added).\n   4\n     Buono is a retired NPS employee who worked for the agency from\n1972 to 1997. From September 1994 to December 1995, Buono worked\nas the Assistant Superintendent of the Preserve.\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                        11801\nenjoined from permitting display of the Latin cross in the area\nof Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”5\n\n  B.    DESIGNATION OF THE CROSS AS A NATIONAL MEMORIAL\n\n   In January 2002, while this matter was pending in district\ncourt, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill, which\nincluded a section designating the Sunrise Rock cross as a\n“national memorial.” See Pub.L. No. 107-117 § 8137, 115\nStat. 2278-79 (2002), codified at 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56\n(note) (hereafter “§ 8137”). That section provides:\n\n      (a) DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL MEMORIAL.\n      —The five-foot-tall white cross first erected by the\n      Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States in\n      1934 along Cima Road in San Bernardino County,\n      California, and now located within the boundary of\n      the Mojave National Preserve, as well as a limited\n      amount of adjoining Preserve property to be desig-\n      nated by the Secretary of the Interior, is hereby des-\n      ignated as a national memorial commemorating\n      United States participation in World War I and hon-\n      oring the American veterans of that war.\n\n      (b) LEGAL DESCRIPTION.—The memorial cross\n      referred to in subsection (a) is located at latitude\n      35.316 North and longitude 115.548 West. The exact\n      acreage and legal description of the property to be\n      included by the Secretary of the Interior in the\n  5\n    We granted the government’s motion to stay the injunction pending\nappeal, insofar as the injunction required NPS to immediately remove or\ndismantle the cross. The stay did not apply to any “alternative methods”\nfor complying with, or additional obligations imposed by, the district\ncourt’s order. See Buono II, 371 F.3d at 545 n.1 (discussing stay orders).\nDuring the appeal, NPS covered the cross, first with a large tarpaulin and\nlater with a plywood box, which the government asserts will remain in\nplace pending resolution of this action.\n\f11802               BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n    national World War I memorial shall be determined\n    by a survey prepared by the Secretary.\n\n    (c) REINSTALLATION             OF      MEMORIAL\n    PLAQUE.—The Secretary of the Interior shall use\n    not more than $10,000 of funds available for the\n    administration of the Mojave National Preserve to\n    acquire a replica of the original memorial plaque\n    and cross placed at the national World War I memo-\n    rial designated by subsection (a) and to install the\n    plaque in a suitable location on the grounds of the\n    memorial.\n\nId. (emphases added). The cross is designated the “White\nCross World War I Memorial.” 16 U.S.C. § 431 (note).\n\n   NPS is statutorily charged with “the supervision, manage-\nment, and control of the several national parks and national\nmonuments.” 16 U.S.C. § 2. National “memorials” fall within\nthe broader category of national “monuments.” See U.S.C.\n§ 431 (note) (identifying recognized national monuments,\nincluding various categories of “national monuments” and\n“national memorials”).\n\n   In October 2002, less than three months after the district\ncourt’s injunction, in legislation aimed at the Sunrise Rock\ncross, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill that\nincluded a provision barring the use of federal funds “to dis-\nmantle national memorials commemorating United States par-\nticipation in World War I.” Pub. L. No. 107-248 § 8065(b),\n116 Stat.1551 (2002) (hereafter “§ 8065”).\n\n  C.    BUONO II   AND   PASSAGE OF § 8121\n\n   The government appealed the district court’s order and\ninjunction. In September 2003, one month after oral argument\nbefore a panel of our court but before a decision issued, Con-\ngress enacted another defense appropriations bill that included\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                    11803\na land exchange agreement regarding the Sunrise Rock cross.\nSee Pub. L. No. 108-87 § 8121(a)-(f), 117 Stat. 1100 (2003),\ncodified at 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56 (note), (hereafter\n“§ 8121”). The statute provides:\n\n    (a) EXCHANGE REQUIRED.— In exchange for\n    the private property described in subsection (b), the\n    Secretary of the Interior shall convey to the Veterans\n    Home of California— Barstow, Veterans of Foreign\n    Wars Post #385E (in this section referred to as the\n    “recipient”), all right, title, and interest of the United\n    States in and to a parcel of real property consisting\n    of approximately one acre in the Mojave National\n    Preserve and designated (by section 8137 of the\n    Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002\n    (Public Law 107-117; 115 Stat. 2278)) as a national\n    memorial commemorating United States participa-\n    tion in World War I and honoring the American vet-\n    erans of that war. Notwithstanding the conveyance\n    of the property under this subsection, the Secretary\n    shall continue to carry out the responsibilities of the\n    Secretary under such section 8137.\n\n    (b) CONSIDERATION.—As consideration for the\n    property to be conveyed by the Secretary under sub-\n    section (a), Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sandoz of Mountain\n    Pass, California, have agreed to convey to the Secre-\n    tary a parcel of real property consisting of approxi-\n    mately five acres, identified as parcel APN 569-051-\n    44, and located in the west 1/2 of the northeast 1/4\n    of the northwest 1/4 of the northwest 1/4 of section\n    11, township 14 north, range 15 east, San Bernardino\n    base and meridian.\n\n§ 8121(a)-(b) (emphases added). The government retains a\nreversionary interest in the property as follows:\n\n    (e) REVERSIONARY CLAUSE. — The convey-\n    ance under subsection (a) shall be subject to the con-\n\f11804                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n    dition that the recipient maintain the conveyed\n    property as a memorial commemorating United\n    States participation in World War I and honoring the\n    American veterans of that war. If the Secretary\n    determines that the conveyed property is no longer\n    being maintained as a war memorial, the property\n    shall revert to the ownership of the United States.\n\n§ 8121(e) (emphasis added). The cross-reference in § 8121(a)\nto § 8137 pertains to use of federal funds to acquire a replica\ncross and plaque. See § 8197(c). The land transfer was under-\nway when the district court enjoined its enforcement, as\ndescribed below.\n\n   In June 2004, in affirming the district court’s permanent\ninjunction, we held that the presence of the cross in the Pre-\nserve violates the Establishment Clause, agreeing with the\ndistrict court that this case is “squarely controlled” by Separa-\ntion of Church and State Committee v. City of Eugene, 93\nF.3d 617 (9th Cir. 1996) (“SCSC”). Buono II, 371 F.3d at 548.\nIn SCSC, we reasoned that the presence of a cross on city\nland, even where it bore a plaque dedicating the cross as a war\nmemorial to veterans, 93 F.3d at 618, violated the Establish-\nment Clause because “the presence of the cross may reason-\nably be perceived as governmental endorsement of\nChristianity.” Id. at 620.\n\n   The government’s several attempts to distinguish SCSC\nwere not persuasive. For example, we held that it was “of no\nmoment” that the cross in SCSC was significantly taller,\nlocated in an urban area, or illuminated during certain holi-\ndays:\n\n    Though not illuminated, the cross here is bolted to a\n    rock outcropping rising fifteen to twenty feet above\n    grade and is visible to vehicles on the adjacent road\n    from a hundred yards away. Even if the shorter\n    height of the Sunrise Rock cross means that it is visi-\n\f                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                  11805\n    ble to fewer people than was the SCSC cross, this\n    makes it no less likely that the Sunrise Rock cross\n    will project a message of government endorsement.\n    . . . Nor does the remote location of Sunrise Rock\n    make a difference. That the Sunrise Rock cross is not\n    near a government building is insignificant — nei-\n    ther was the SCSC cross. What is significant is that\n    the Sunrise Rock cross, like the SCSC cross, sits on\n    public park land. National parklands and preserves\n    embody the notion of government ownership as\n    much as urban parkland, and the remote location of\n    Sunrise Rock does nothing to detract from that\n    notion.\n\nBuono II, 371 F.3d at 549-50 (emphasis added).\n\n    We also held that a reasonable observer, even without\nknowing whether Sunrise Rock is federally owned, would\nbelieve—or at least suspect—that the cross rests on public\nland because of the vast size of the Preserve, more than 90\npercent of which is federally owned. Id. at 550 (citing reason-\nable observer test set forth in Capitol Square Review & Advi-\nsory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 780-81 (1995) (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring)). A reasonably informed observer aware of the\nhistory of the Sunrise Rock cross would know not only that\nthe cross was erected by private individuals (which the gov-\nernment argued favored its view), but also that Congress has\ntaken various measures to preserve the cross, i.e., designating\nit a war memorial, prohibiting use of federal funds to remove\nit, and denying similar access for a Buddhist shrine. Id.\n\n   Acknowledging the passage of § 8121 while the appeal was\npending, we addressed the government’s challenge that\n§ 8121 rendered the appeal moot or would soon do so. We\nrejected the government’s mootness challenge for two rea-\nsons: First, we held that the case was not moot because the\nland transfer had not yet taken effect. Id. at 545. Second,\nbecause “[m]ere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal con-\n\f11806                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nduct does not moot a case,” we held that even if the land trans-\nfer had taken effect, the government still had not carried its\nheavy burden to show mootness. Id. at 546. Even if the land\nwere transferred under § 8121(a), it may revert to the govern-\nment under § 8121(e), or as provided in other statutes. In par-\nticular, we noted that 16 U.S.C. § 431 authorizes\nrelinquishment of lands containing “national monuments” to\nthe federal government, and 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56 autho-\nrizes the Department of the Interior to “acquire all lands and\ninterest in lands within the boundary of the [Mojave] preserve\nby donation, purchase, or exchange.” Id. at 546 (discussing\n§ 8121, 16 U.S.C. §§ 431, 410aaa-56).\n\n  D.    BUONO III\n\n   Despite the injunction against display of the cross in the\nPreserve, the government began moving forward with the\nmechanics of the land exchange under § 8121. Buono then\nmoved to enforce the district court’s prior injunction, or mod-\nify it to prohibit the land exchange as a violation of the Estab-\nlishment Clause. In April 2005, the district court granted\nBuono’s motion to enforce the injunction, and denied as moot\nthe request to amend the permanent injunction. See Buono v.\nNorton, 364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1177, 1182 & n.8 (C.D. Cal.\n2005) (“Buono III”). According to the district court, “the\ntransfer of the Preserve land containing the Latin Cross which\nas [a] sectarian war memorial carries an inherently religious\nmessage and creates an appearance of honoring only those\nservicemen of that particular religion is an attempt by the gov-\nernment to evade the permanent injunction enjoining the dis-\nplay of the Latin Cross atop Sunrise Rock.” Id. at 1182\n(citation and quotation marks omitted). The district court\ndeemed the exchange “invalid” and permanently enjoined the\ngovernment “from implementing the provisions of Section\n8121 of Public Law 108-87” and ordered the government “to\ncomply forthwith with the judgment and permanent injunction\nentered by th[e] court on July 24, 2002.” Id. It is that decision\nthat the government now appeals.\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                    11807\n                     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review for abuse of discretion the district court’s order\nenforcing its prior injunction. Paulson v. City of San Diego,\n294 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 2002). A district court abuses\nits discretion in this regard if “it bases its decision on an erro-\nneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.”\nId.\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\n   In the district court, Buono advanced two alternative argu-\nments challenging the land exchange under § 8121. First,\nBuono argued that the land exchange is an attempt to evade\nthe permanent injunction. Alternatively, he argued that the\nland exchange itself violates the Establishment Clause\nbecause it is an improper governmental endorsement of reli-\ngion. The district court’s holding is grounded only on the first\nbasis, i.e., that the land exchange is a sham transaction with\nthe purpose of permitting continued display of the cross in\nviolation of the permanent injunction. On appeal, the govern-\nment contends that § 8121 was a bona fide attempt by Con-\ngress to comply with the injunction. The government also\nargues that because it was not given the opportunity to fully\neffectuate the transfer, there are unknown facts that render\nthis controversy “unripe” for judicial review.\n\n   Turning first to the government’s ripeness challenge, we\nconclude that this controversy is ripe for review. As to the\nsecond question, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin enforcing the injunction. We agree that the exchange effec-\ntuated by § 8121 violates the injunction, which prohibits the\ndisplay of the Latin cross because it runs afoul of the Estab-\nlishment Clause.\n\nI.   RIPENESS\n\n  Ripeness is a justiciability requirement that seeks to avoid\npremature litigation of disputes. Thomas v. Union Carbide\n\f11808               BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nAgr. Products Co., 473 U.S. 568, 579-81 (1985) (“[R]ipeness\nis peculiarly a question of timing.”) (citations omitted). The\nripeness doctrine “is drawn both from Article III limitations\non judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to\nexercise jurisdiction.” Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509\nU.S. 43, 57 n.18 (1993); accord Thomas v. Anchorage Equal\nRights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138-42 (9th Cir. 2000) (en\nbanc) (discussing constitutional and prudential components of\nripeness). The ripeness question we address is whether it is\npremature to consider a violation of the injunction before\ncompletion of the land exchange.\n\n  A.    CONSTITUTIONAL COMPONENT OF RIPENESS\n\n  The constitutional component of ripeness—that there be an\nArticle III “case or controversy”—requires a concrete impact\nupon the parties arising from the dispute. Union Carbide, 473\nU.S. at 579. This analysis is similar to the injury-in-fact\ninquiry under the standing doctrine. See Anchorage Equal\nRights Comm’n, 220 F.3d at 1138-39.\n\n   The government argues that before litigation proceeds, it\nshould be given an opportunity to try to execute the land\nexchange in compliance with the prior injunction and the gov-\nernment’s constitutional obligations. Buono responds that the\n“concrete” injury ripe for review is that the land transaction’s\nvery structure evidences its lack of a secular purpose and its\neffect continues the government’s improper endorsement of\nreligion that we already held exists.\n\n   This case can best be described as an ongoing controversy\nabout the cross, the specifics of which shift with successive\ncongressional enactments. The controversy is neither prema-\nture nor will it go away on its own. Given the specifics of\n§ 8121, it is no answer to say that the land exchange is not\ncomplete. It is, as the district court notes, “already in prog-\nress,” and the government intends to complete it. Buono III,\n364 F. Supp. 2d at 1178. Buono’s challenge to the present\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11809\nterms of the exchange is not a “hypothetical request[ ] for an\nadvisory opinion.” Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220\nF.3d at 1141.\n\n   The Supreme Court has held that pre-enforcement review\nof a statute is appropriate where the governmental purpose in\nenacting the statute evidences an improper endorsement of\nreligion in violation of the Establishment Clause. See Santa\nFe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 313-14 (2000). It\nis no legal leap to conclude that pre-enforcement review is\nsimilarly appropriate where the purpose of a statute is to\nevade an injunction intended to end an ongoing Establishment\nClause violation.\n\n   In Santa Fe, the Supreme Court considered the ripeness of\na facial challenge to a school district’s policy purportedly\nallowing school prayer. Id. The policy permitted students (a)\nto vote on whether there should be a student-delivered invoca-\ntion given at the start of high school football games, and (b)\nto later vote to select the one student who would deliver the\ninvocation at all games throughout the year. Id. at 297-98.\nThe school district argued that it was premature to review the\npolicy because there “can be no certainty that any of the state-\nments or invocations will be religious.” Id. at 313. Rejecting\nthat challenge, the Court concluded that while forcing a stu-\ndent “to participate in religious worship” was a serious consti-\ntutional injury, so too was the “mere passage by [the school\ndistrict] of a policy that has the purpose and perception of\ngovernment establishment of religion. . . . [and] the imple-\nmentation of a governmental electoral process that subjects\nthe issue of prayer to a majoritarian vote.” Id. at 313-14 (rec-\nognizing that “the Constitution also requires that we keep in\nmind ‘the myriad, subtle ways in which Establishment Clause\nvalues can be eroded.’ ”) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465\nU.S. 668, 694 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). Thus, the\nmere enactment of the policy, particularly in light of the\nschool district’s conduct, was a sufficient constitutional injury\nto warrant pre-enforcement review, and ultimately an injunc-\n\f11810                   BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\ntion against implementation of the policy. Id. at 316.6 Impor-\ntantly, in analyzing ripeness, the Court looked to the history\nof the school district’s conduct in enacting the policy and the\ntrue purpose of the policy. Id. at 314-15.\n\n   The analogy to Santa Fe is apt. Here, both the district court\nand this court have concluded that a grave constitutional\ninjury already exists. The permitting display of the Sunrise\nRock cross in the Preserve is an impermissible governmental\nendorsement of religion. See Buono II, 371 F.3d at 548-50. As\ndiscussed further below, the constitutional injury will persist\nafter—and as a result of—the land exchange effectuated\nunder § 8121. This is so because (among other things) § 8121\nand other applicable statutes7 permit the government’s signifi-\ncant ongoing control of and involvement with the cross and\nthe property on which it is situated. See Santa Fe, 530 U.S.\nat 314-15 (concluding that the text of the school district’s pol-\nicy alone reveals the extent of school involvement in the elec-\ntion of the student speaker and the content of the message to\nbe delivered). And, the government’s repeated actions in pre-\nserving the cross (and forestalling enforcement of the injunc-\ntion) further evidence its goal of keeping the cross in place,\nsee §§ 133, 8137, 8056(b), 8121, just as the school district in\n  6\n     Our cases have similarly held that passage of a statute and putting it\ninto effect (even if the effect is not complete) gives rise to a dispute ripe\nfor judicial review. In Saint Elizabeth Community Hospital v. NLRB, 708\nF.2d 1436 (9th Cir. 1983), a church-run hospital challenged the National\nLabor Relations Board’s jurisdiction over it as a violation of the Establish-\nment Clause. Id. at 1440. Congress had amended the National Labor Rela-\ntions Act expressly conferring jurisdiction over nonprofit hospitals without\nexcepting those run by religious institutions. We concluded that the ques-\ntion of NLRB’s jurisdiction was ripe for review. Id. In Assiniboine &\nSioux Tribes of Fort Peck Indian Reservation v. Board of Oil & Gas Con-\nservation of the State of Montana, 792 F.2d 782 (9th Cir. 1986), we held\nthat the claim of Indian tribes challenging the validity of a cooperative\nagreement regarding agency jurisdiction to advise the tribes about oil and\ngas rights was sufficiently ripe where the final cooperative agreement had\nbeen placed into operation by the agreeing agencies. Id. at 788-89.\n   7\n     See § 8137(a)-(c), 16 U.S.C. §§ 431, 410aaa-56.\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                          11811\nSanta Fe acted with the purpose of maintaining a school pol-\nicy permitting prayer at school events. Santa Fe, 503 U.S. at\n314-15.8\n\n   Buono has alleged a sufficient constitutional injury to over-\ncome any argument that his challenge to § 8121 is unripe. See\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 314-15. The challenge in this case pre-\nsents a concrete injury, rather than an “imaginary” or “specu-\nlative” one.9\n\n  B.    PRUDENTIAL COMPONENT OF RIPENESS\n\n   Even where a concrete case or controversy is present, we\nconsider whether, because of prudential concerns, we should\ndecline to exercise jurisdiction. See Union Carbide, 473 U.S.\nat 581; Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d at 1141.\nWe evaluate two interrelated factors: (a) the hardship that the\nparty seeking relief will suffer from withholding judicial\naction, and (b) the fitness of the issues in the record for judi-\ncial review. Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49\n(1967), overruled on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders,\n430 U.S. 99 (1977).\n  8\n     The various governmental actions are discussed in further detail infra\n§ II.A.3.\n   9\n     The government can hardly rely, as a predicate for a ripeness chal-\nlenge, on its attempt to temporarily comply with the permanent injunction\nby covering the cross with a wooden box. If that were the final compliance\nmechanism, the district court could determine whether it is sufficient. Sig-\nnificantly, however, the government is proceeding with the land exchange.\nSee Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\n127 S.Ct. 2738, 2751 (2007) (holding that school district’s voluntary ces-\nsation of use of racial tiebreaker pending outcome of litigation did not\nnegate Article III standing of plaintiff group members challenging policy,\nas the school continued to vigorously defend the policy in court); Friends\nof Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l Svcs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189\n(2000) (holding that voluntary cessation of wrongful conduct, either by\ndefendant’s achievement of substantial compliance with its permit require-\nments or its shutdown of offending facility, did not moot controversy over\ndefendant’s compliance with Clean Water Act because the offending con-\nduct had not permanently ceased).\n\f11812                   BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n   This case easily satisfies both prudential components. As to\nthe harm,“[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of\nthreatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is\ncertainly impending, that is enough.” Union Carbide, 473\nU.S. at 581 (internal quotations and citations omitted).10 The\nhardship resulting from the continuation of an Establishment\nClause violation enjoined by the court is sufficient.\n\n   A claim is “fit for decision if the issues raised are primarily\nlegal, do not require further factual development, and the\nchallenged action is final.” Exxon Corp. v. Heinze, 32 F.3d\n1399, 1404 (9th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted). These require-\nments are satisfied here.\n\n   The key issue is primarily a question of law, i.e., whether\nthe land exchange under § 8121 violates the district court’s\norder permanently enjoining the government from permitting\ndisplay of the cross in the Preserve. See, e.g., Santa Fe, 530\nU.S. at 314 (permitting facial challenge to school district’s\npolicy prior to enforcement of the policy based largely on the\nCourt’s ability to construe the constitutionality of the policy’s\npurpose as a legal matter); Union Carbide, 473 U.S. at 581\n(granting pre-enforcement review of constitutionality of\nadministrative scheme requiring registrants to participate in\nbinding arbitration of disputes with limited judicial review\nbecause party’s challenge raised solely legal issues).\n\n   Next, we assess the state of the factual record, an inquiry\nthat overlaps with (and in this case collapses into) the third\ncomponent, the finality of the decision. Friedman Bros. Inv.\nCo. v. Lewis, 676 F.2d 1317, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982). The gov-\n  10\n     Unlike in Anchorage Equal Right Comm’n, where the plaintiffs sought\nreview of a housing law “in a vacuum and in the absence of any particular\nvictims of discrimination,” 220 F.3d at 1142, in this case there is a con-\ncrete victim—Buono—and the statutes are not being analyzed in a vac-\nuum. See, e.g., Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 1181-82 (discussing history\nof government’s preservation efforts regarding the cross).\n\f                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11813\nernment argues that the record is incomplete because certain\nfactual scenarios, as yet unknown, could occur at some time\nin the future. The government illustrates its claim by positing\ntwo potential scenarios that may occur rendering decision on\nthis appeal premature. Upon examination, neither proposed\nscenario persuades us that we should delay decision in this\nmatter.\n\n   First, the government argues that once the land exchange is\ncomplete the VFW might at some point in the future remove\nthe cross, but continue to maintain the property as a “war\nmemorial” as provided under § 8121. Thus, according to the\ngovernment, the court should not decide whether the injunc-\ntion is violated unless and until the land exchange is complete\nand the VFW has an opportunity to decide whether to main-\ntain or remove the cross.\n\n  Under the government’s construction, the dispute would\nnever be ripe because, even if the transfer occurred, the gov-\nernment or the VFW could always argue that removal of the\ncross could occur at some point in the future. Such games-\nmanship is not sanctioned by our prudential ripeness doctrine.\n\n   The government’s view is also at odds with two statutes\nrelated to the Sunrise Rock cross, which, when read together,\ndemonstrate that the VFW cannot remove the cross without\nforfeiting the property to the government. Section 8137(a)\ndesignates “the five-foot-tall white cross” . . . as a “national\nmemorial.” § 8137(a) (emphasis added); see also § 8137(b)\n(referring to “[t]he memorial cross”); 16 U.S.C. § 431 (note)\n(listing “national memorial” titled “White Cross World War\nI Memorial”). In other words, the cross itself is the memorial.\nSection 8121(e) conditions transfer of the land on the VFW’s\nagreement to “maintain the conveyed property as a memorial\ncommemorating United States participation in World War I\nand honoring the American veterans of that war.” § 8121(e).\nSection 8121(e) further provides that if “the conveyed prop-\nerty is no longer being maintained as a war memorial, the\n\f11814               BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nproperty shall revert to the ownership of the United States.”\nId. (emphasis added). Under these two statutes, the VFW’s\nremoval of the cross from Sunrise Rock would trigger the\nreversionary clause of § 8121(e) and the land would revert to\nthe United States. Nothing permits the VFW to destroy a\nnational memorial, remove the cross, and erect a substitute\nmemorial. The entire scheme is directed to preservation of the\ncross.\n\n   To suggest that we do not yet know enough facts to decide\nthis dispute ignores the practical reality of these statutory\nmandates. In Santa Fe, the Court rejected the school district’s\nsimilarly implausible explanations for its conduct, based on\nthe history and context of the school district’s actions:\n\n    The District, nevertheless, asks us to pretend that we\n    do not recognize what every Santa Fe High School\n    student understands clearly — that this policy is\n    about prayer. The District further asks us to accept\n    what is obviously untrue: that these messages are\n    necessary to “solemnize” a football game and that\n    this single-student, year-long position is essential to\n    the protection of student speech. We refuse to turn a\n    blind eye to the context in which this policy arose,\n    and that context quells any doubt that this policy was\n    implemented with the purpose of endorsing school\n    prayer.\n\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 315 (emphasis added).\n\n   The government also argues that DOI might never exercise\nthe reversionary clause, even if the cross is removed. Again,\nthis argument fails as § 8121(e) itself provides that the prop-\nerty “shall revert” if the property is no longer maintained as\na “war memorial,” i.e., the cross under § 8137. Countenanc-\ning this argument would also render the claim perpetually\nunripe, bringing to mind the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\f                         BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                           11815\nAlthough the rule surely does not apply in this context, com-\nmon sense should.\n\n   Even though the transfer itself is not complete, the certainty\nof the governmental action taking place is sufficiently ripe to\nallow review. See, e.g., Friedman, 676 F.2d at 1318-19 (con-\ncluding that challenge to agency’s action as violating National\nEnvironmental Policy Act was ripe where agency had granted\nfunds for project and exempted it from certain of NEPA’s\nrequirements, despite that formal action to acquire the subject\nproperty by condemnation had not yet commenced). Thus,\nnone of the prudential ripeness concerns weigh against our\nrendering a decision.11\n\nII.    VIOLATION OF THE PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n   We next address whether the district court abused its dis-\ncretion in concluding that “transfer of the Preserve land con-\ntaining the Latin Cross, which ‘as [a] sectarian war memorial\ncarries an inherently religious message and creates an appear-\n  11\n    The government raises, for the first time on appeal, a second challenge\nunder the guise of “ripeness.” It argues that the district court exceeded its\npower by issuing a second injunction in the face the government’s effort\nto comply with the original injunction. This is not a true ripeness consider-\nation, but a challenge to the propriety of the district court’s exercise of its\nequitable power to enforce its prior injunction. Because this issue is not\none of justiciability or jurisdiction, the government waived the argument\nby failing to challenge the scope of the district court’s action before that\ncourt. See, e.g., Ritchie v. United States, 451 F.3d 1019, 1026 & n.12 (9th\nCir. 2006) (concluding that failure to raise an issue before district court\nresulted in waiver on appeal, particularly where the issue involved district\ncourt’s broad discretion and district court “might have been able to\naddress the problem” if raised). Even assuming no waiver, the district\ncourt acted within its broad equitable powers to enforce its prior injunc-\ntion. See, e.g., Ellis v. City of La Mesa, 990 F.2d 1518, 1530-31 (9th Cir.\n1993) (per curiam) (noting, in dispute over religious symbols on public\nland, that in light of changed circumstances of ownership of land (or a\nplanned change in ownership), district court has broad equitable powers\n“to modify, fashion or enforce appropriate equitable relief” in assessing\ncompliance with its prior injunction).\n\f11816                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nance of honoring only those servicemen of that particular reli-\ngion’ . . . is an attempt by the government to evade the\npermanent injunction enjoining the display of the Latin Cross\natop Sunset Rock.” Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 1182 (cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n  A.     GOVERNMENT ACTION\n\n   In Buono II, we noted that “the presence of a religious sym-\nbol on once-public land that has been transferred into private\nhands may still violate the Establishment Clause.” Buono II,\n371 F.3d at 546 (citing Freedom from Religion Found., Inc.\nv. City of Marshfield, 203 F.3d 487, 496 (7th Cir. 2000)).12\nBut we left for another day the question of “whether a transfer\ncompleted under section 8121 would pass constitutional mus-\nter.” Id. In considering that question, we examine both the\nform and substance of the transaction to determine whether\nthe government action endorsing religion has actually ceased.\nSee Marshfield, 203 F.3d at 491.13\n  12\n      In Marshfield, it was undisputed that a white, marble, fifteen-foot\nstatue of Jesus Christ situated on city park land violated the Establishment\nClause. Id. at 489. To remedy the violation, the city sold the statue and a\nsmall parcel of land (0.15 acres) beneath the statue to a private organiza-\ntion that agreed to maintain the land and the statue, including paying for\nthe electrical service used to light the statue. Id. at 490. After concluding\nthat the sale properly ended the government action with respect to the\nstatue and the property, the court determined that the statue’s presence still\nviolated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 495. Based on the historic associ-\nation of the land with the public park, the dedication of the land to use as\na public park through a restrictive covenant, and the physical location and\nvisual perception of the now-private property within the public park, the\ncourt concluded that a reasonable observer would perceive that the statue\nwas on city park property and that it “constitute[d] a City endorsement of\nreligion.” Id. at 495-96.\n   13\n      Although the Seventh Circuit adopted a presumption that “a sale of\nreal property is an effective way for a public body to end its inappropriate\nendorsement of religion” in the absence of “unusual circumstances,” Mar-\nshfield, 203 F.3d at 491, we decline to adopt such presumption. The\nSupreme Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence recognizes the need\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                          11817\n   As did the district court, based on the circumstances of this\ncase, we consider three aspects of the land exchange under\n§ 8121: (1) the government’s continuing oversight and rights\nin the site containing the cross after the proposed land\nexchange; (2) the method for effectuating the land exchange;\nand (3) the history of the government’s efforts to preserve the\ncross.\n\n     1.    CONTINUING GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL\n           OVER THE CROSS AND PRESERVE PROPERTY\n\n  Although Congress sought to transfer the property to the\nVFW, a private entity, the various statutes, when read as a\npackage, evince continuing government control. The follow-\ning summary highlights that control:\n\n     •    NPS retains overall management and supervision\n          of the Preserve.\n\n     •    NPS is responsible for “the supervision, manage-\n          ment, and control” of national memorials.\n\nto conduct a fact-specific inquiry in this area. Compare McCreary County\nv. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, 545 U.S. 844, 884-85\n(2005) (holding unconstitutional postings of Ten Commandments at\ncounty courthouses on the basis that counties’ purpose in erecting displays\ndemonstrated impermissible governmental endorsement of religion), with\nVan Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 700 (2005) (upholding “passive monu-\nment” inscribed with Ten Commandments on Texas State Capitol grounds\nbased on analysis of monument’s and nation’s history) (Rehnquist, C.J.)\n(plurality opinion). See also Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 685 nn. 4 & 5 (citing\ncases under the Establishment Clause over the preceding 25 years of\nSupreme Court jurisprudence). Moreover, the “public function” cases dis-\ncussed in Marshfield suggest that constitutional violations are not pre-\nsumptively cured when control is transferred from public to private hands.\nEvans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 301 (1966) (“[W]here the tradition of\nmunicipal control had become firmly established, we cannot take judicial\nnotice that the mere substitution of trustees instantly transferred this park\nfrom the public to the private sector.”); Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 469\n(1953) (lack of formal public control over election primary “immaterial”\nto analysis of constitutional violation).\n\f11818                   BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n       •   The “five-foot-tall white cross” in the Mojave\n           National Preserve is designated as a “national\n           memorial.”\n\n       •   The transfer of land to the VFW is conditioned\n           on the VFW’s maintenance of the conveyed\n           property as a memorial to World War I veterans.\n\n       •   The Secretary must carry out its duties under\n           § 8137, which provides $10,000 for NPS to\n           acquire and install replicas of the original cross\n           and plaque.\n\n       •   The property “shall revert” to government owner-\n           ship if “it is no longer being maintained as a war\n           memorial.”\n\n   The government retains various rights of control over the\ncross and the property. NPS is granted statutory powers of\n“supervision, management, and control” of national memori-\nals. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 2, 431. Thus, NPS’s general supervisory\nand managerial responsibilities with respect to the cross\nremain, despite a land transfer. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1 (pro-\nviding that the newly created NPS is responsible for regulat-\ning and promoting “national parks, monuments, and\nreservations . . . by such means and measures as conform to\nthe fundamental purpose” of conservation); 16 U.S.C. § 3\n(“The Secretary of the Interior shall make and publish such\nrules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for\nthe use and management of the parks, monuments, and reser-\nvations under the jurisdiction of [NPS].”).14\n\n  In addition, § 8121(a) expressly reserves NPS’s manage-\nment responsibilities under § 8137. See § 8121(a)\n  14\n     The government does not dispute that the Preserve is under NPS’s\njurisdiction as a unit of the national park system. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 1(c),\n410aaa-41, 410aaa-42, 410aaa-46.\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11819\n(“Notwithstanding the conveyance of the property under this\nsubsection, the Secretary shall continue to carry out the\nresponsibilities of the Secretary under such section 8137.”).\nSection 8137 not only designates the cross a national memo-\nrial, but provides for $10,000 in funds for NPS to acquire and\ninstall replicas of the original plaque and cross located at the\nsite. See § 8137(a)-(c). The district court found that these pro-\nvisions gave the government an easement or license over the\nsubject property for this particular purpose. Buono III, 364 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1180. Such an easement or license reflects ongo-\ning control over the property requiring compliance with con-\nstitutional requirements on that land. See, e.g., First Unitarian\nChurch of Salt Lake v. Salt Lake, 308 F.3d 1114, 1122 (10th\nCir. 2002) (holding that where the government sells land to a\nprivate religious organization but maintains a pedestrian ease-\nment on the land, the First Amendment speech clause applies\neven though the private party holds title to the land).\n\n   The district court also focused on the significance of the\ngovernment’s retention of a reversionary interest in the prop-\nerty under § 8121(e). See Hampton v. City of Jacksonville,\n304 F.2d 320, 322-23 (5th Cir. 1962) (holding that the inclu-\nsion of a reversionary clause in deeds to segregated golf\ncourses conveyed by the city to private parties was sufficient\nstate action to bring the golf courses within the Fourteenth\nAmendment because the reversionary clauses allowed the city\nto exercise “complete present control” over the golf courses);\nEaton v. Grubbs, 329 F.2d 710, 714 (4th Cir. 1964) (holding\nthat a reverter clause in a deed of trust allowed the city to\neffectively exercise control of the facility to ensure that it was\nalways used “as a hospital,” and that such ongoing city con-\ntrol over use of property constituted sufficient state action to\nsubject the hospital to the Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibi-\ntions against racial discrimination). As in Hampton and\nEaton, the reversionary clause in § 8121(e) results in ongoing\ngovernment control over the subject property, even after the\ntransfer.\n\f11820                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n   Although the government argues that reversionary interests\nare run-of-the mill clauses in contracts with the government,\nthe commonality of such clauses does not diminish their\npower or effect. The fact remains that the government has an\nautomatic reversionary interest in the property if it determines\nthat the property is no longer being used as a “war memorial,”\nwhich, at this juncture, is the cross itself. See § 8137. See also\nBuono II, 371 F.3d at 546 (noting the importance of the gov-\nernment’s reversionary interest, and various other mecha-\nnisms by which the government can acquire public lands, in\nconcluding that the dispute had not been rendered moot by\npassage of § 8121).\n\n   As it did with respect to ripeness, the government argues\nthat the court must await exercise of the reversionary interest\nbefore determining whether it is a real factor in government\ncontrol over the property. We reiterate the import of the rever-\nsionary interest; it shows the government’s ongoing control\nover the property and that the parties will conduct themselves\nin the shadow of that control. The courts in Hampton and\nEaton found dispositive the ongoing control resulting from\nthe reversionary interest; their analysis is persuasive here.\n\n   Based on the government’s ongoing supervisory, mainte-\nnance and oversight responsibilities with respect to the cross\nand the property, coupled with the reversionary interest, the\ndistrict court found that the government retains important\nproperty rights in, and “will continue to exercise substantial\ncontrol over,” the property on which Sunrise Rock is located,\neven after the land exchange. Id. at 1179. The government has\nfailed to show that this determination is either clearly errone-\nous or an abuse of discretion.\n\n  2.    METHOD FOR EFFECTUATING THE LAND EXCHANGE\n\n   Next, we examine the method of sale by which § 8121\ntransfers the property to a private buyer outside the normal\nNPS procedures for transfer of parklands. The Secretary of\n\f                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11821\nDOI is authorized to exchange federal land for non-federal\nland under its jurisdiction. See 16 U.S.C. § 460l-22(b); see\nalso § 410aaa 56 (authorizing the Secretary to “acquire all\nlands and interest in lands within the boundary of the\n[Mojave] preserve by donation, purchase, or exchange”). In\nthis case, however, the decision to exchange the land was\nmade by Congress and authorized by a provision buried in an\nappropriations bill. The government did not hold a hearing\nbefore enacting such exchange. E.g., id. § 460l-22(b) (provid-\ning that upon request, “prior to such exchange the Secretary\n. . . shall hold a public hearing in the area where the lands to\nbe exchanged are located”). Nor did the government open bid-\nding to the general public. E.g., id. § 460l-22(a). Rather,\n§ 8121 directs that the land be transferred to the VFW, the\norganization that originally installed a cross on Sunrise Rock\nsome years ago and desires the continued presence of the cur-\nrent cross in the Preserve. The private land being exchanged\nfor the federal property is owned by the Sandozes, who con-\nstructed the present cross and who have actively sought to\nkeep the cross on Sunrise Rock. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1180.\n\n   The government argues that, of all parties, the VFW is the\n“logical purchaser” because it originally erected the cross at\nthe site more than seventy years ago. The government cites\nMarshfield and another Seventh Circuit case, Mercier v. Fra-\nternal Order of Eagles, 395 F.3d 693 (7th Cir. 2005). In both\ncases, the respective courts upheld the sale of property to a\nprivate party without an open market bidding process for the\nland. Marshfield, 203 F.3d at 489-90; Mercier, 395 F.3d at\n694-95, 702-03.\n\n   Although neither the exclusion of other purchasers, nor the\nfact that Congress acted outside the scope of normal agency\nprocedures for disposing of federal park land is dispositive,\nboth acts demonstrate the government’s unusual involvement\nin this transaction. These facts, coupled with the govern-\nment’s selection of beneficiaries of the land exchange who\n\f11822                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nhave a significant interest and personal investment in preserv-\ning the cross that has been ordered removed, provide addi-\ntional evidence that the government is seeking to circumvent\nthe injunction in this case. We see no basis to upset the dis-\ntrict court’s conclusion that the VFW was a straw purchaser.\nId. at 1181.\n\n  3. HISTORY      OF    THE   GOVERNMENT’S       PRESERVATION\n  EFFORTS\n\n   Finally, the government’s long-standing efforts to preserve\nand maintain the cross atop Sunrise Rock lead us to the unde-\nniable conclusion that the government’s purpose in this case\nis to evade the injunction and keep the cross in place. In brief,\nwhen litigation was first threatened against NPS, Congress\nbanned the use of government funds to remove the cross\n(§ 133), the first step in forestalling inevitable enforcement of\na federal injunction. After litigation commenced, Congress\ndesignated the cross and adjoining Preserve property as a\nnational memorial commemorating World War I (§ 8137).\nCongress also appropriated up to $10,000 for NPS to acquire\nreplicas of the original cross and plaque at the site (id.), once\nmore trying to bolster the presence of the cross. Once the dis-\ntrict court enjoined display of the cross in Buono I, Congress\nagain prohibited the use of federal funds to remove any World\nWar I memorials (which, obviously, includes the cross)\n(§ 8056(b)); and, while the appeal was pending in Buono II,\nCongress enacted § 8121, directing the transfer of the subject\nproperty to a private organization, but maintaining effective\ngovernment control over the memorial and the use of that\nproperty.\n\n   The government does not contest these legislative\nresponses to various stages of the litigation in this case, or\ntheir purpose aimed at preserving the cross. Rather, the gov-\nernment attempts to diminish their importance. For example,\nthe government argues that § 8137(c), which earmarks funds\nfor the replica plaque and cross, was passed before the district\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11823\ncourt’s injunction and that after the injunction, DOI has taken\nno action to acquire the replicas. While this may be true,\nwhen Congress enacted § 8121, it specifically incorporated\nthe Secretary’s duty to carry out the responsibilities set out in\n§ 8137; Congress did not repeal the funding provisions, or\nany other provision permitting ongoing government control.\nThe funding provisions offer historical evidence of the gov-\nernmental responses aimed at preserving the cross, as well as\nongoing legislative authorizations. In that context, it does not\nmatter whether DOI has exercised its powers to obtain such\nreplicas; the important fact is that Congress directed that it do\nso, further showing its intent to preserve and maintain the\ncross.\n\n   We agree with the district court that the government\nengaged in “herculean efforts” to preserve the cross atop Sun-\nrise Rock. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 1182. We also agree\nthat “the proposed transfer of the subject property can only be\nviewed as an attempt to keep the Latin Cross atop Sunrise\nRock without actually curing the continuing Establishment\nClause violation.” Id.\n\n  B.   CONTINUING GOVERNMENTAL ENDORSEMENT OF\n       RELIGION\n\n   Our inquiry into a purported cure of an Establishment\nClause violation must also analyze whether the improper gov-\nernmental endorsement of religion has ceased. See, e.g., Mar-\nshfield, 203 F.3d at 493-96. Because of the procedural posture\nof this case, we have necessarily already considered that ques-\ntion. We previously held that the presence of the cross in the\nPreserve violates the Establishment Clause. See Buono II, 371\nF.3d at 548-50. We also concluded that a reasonable observer\naware of the history of the cross would know of the govern-\nment’s attempts to preserve it and the denial of access to other\nreligious symbols. Id. at 550. Even a less informed reasonable\nobserver would perceive governmental endorsement of the\nmessage, given that “[n]ational parklands and preserves\n\f11824                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nembody the notion of government ownership,” that the Sun-\nrise Rock area is used as a public campground, and finally,\nbecause of “the ratio of publicly-owned to privately-owned\nland in the Preserve.” Id. Nothing in the present posture of the\ncase alters those earlier conclusions. Under the statutory dic-\ntates and terms that presently stand, carving out a tiny parcel\nof property in the midst of this vast Preserve—like a donut\nhole with the cross atop it—will do nothing to minimize the\nimpermissible governmental endorsement. Nor does the pro-\nposed land exchange under § 8121 end the improper govern-\nment action. Such a transfer cannot be validly executed\nwithout running afoul of the injunction.\n\n   In sum, the government has not shown the district court’s\nfactual findings to be clearly erroneous. Nor has the govern-\nment shown that the district court applied erroneous legal\nstandards. Finally, the district court’s decision does not reflect\nany clear error of judgment. The district court did not abuse\nits discretion in enjoining the government from proceeding\nwith the land exchange under 16 U.S.C. § 8121 and ordering\nthe government to otherwise comply with its prior injunction\nthat it not permit the display of the Sunrise Rock cross in the\nPreserve.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Our court previously held that the presence of\nthe cross in the Preserve—which consists of more than 90\npercent federally-owned land, including the land where the\ncross is situated—violates the Establishment Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution. Buono v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786531\"><a href=\"/opinion/786531/frank-buono-allen-schwartz-v-gale-norton-secretary-of-the-interior-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(9th Cir. 2004). We affirmed the district court’s judgment per-\nmanently enjoining the government “from permitting the dis-\nplay of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the\nMojave National Preserve.”\n\n   During the pendency of the first appeal, Congress enacted\na statute directing that the land on which the cross is situated\nbe transferred to a private organization in exchange for a par-\ncel of privately-owned land located elsewhere in the Preserve.\nSee Pub.L. No. 108-87, R. 12.1, 12.4 § 8121(a)-(f), 117 Stat.\n1100 (2003). That land exchange is already in progress and\nwould leave a little donut hole of land with a cross in the\nmidst of a vast federal preserve. The issue we address today\nis whether the land exchange violates the district court’s per-\nmanent injunction. We conclude that it does, and affirm the\ndistrict court’s order permanently enjoining the government\nfrom effectuating the land exchange and ordering the govern-\nment to comply with the original injunction.\n\n                             BACKGROUND1\n   1\n     Further background detail is found in the district court’s order and our\nprior opinion on the merits of the Establishment Clause challenge.

KEMPTHORNE\nI.    THE MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE\n\n   The Preserve encompasses approximately 1.6 million acres,\nor 2,500 square miles, of primarily federally-owned land in\nthe Mojave Desert, located in Southeastern California. In\n1994, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) transferred\nthe land to the National Park Service (“NPS”); both the BLM\nand the NPS are federal agencies under the Department of the\nInterior (“DOI”). Within the Preserve, approximately 86,000\nacres of land are privately owned and 43,000 acres belong to\nthe State of California. Thus, slightly more than 90 percent of\nthe land in the Preserve is federally owned. The Preserve is\na “unit of the National Park System” and is given “statutory\nprotection as a national preserve.” 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-41,\n410aaa-42; id. § 1(c). The Preserve is under NPS jurisdiction\nand authority. Id. § 410aaa-46.\n\nII.   THE CROSS\n\n   The current incarnation of the cross atop Sunrise Rock is\nbetween five and eight feet tall and is constructed out of four-\ninch diameter metal pipes painted white. It is a Latin cross,\nmeaning that it has two arms, one horizontal and one vertical,\nat right angles to one another. It is undisputed that “[t]he Latin\ncross is the preeminent symbol of Christianity. It is exclu-\nsively a Christian symbol, and not a symbol of any other reli-\ngion.” Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 1205.\n\n   Historic records reflect that a wooden cross was built on\nthat location as early as 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars\n(“VFW”) as a memorial to veterans who died in World War\nI. Photographs depict the wooden cross and signs near it stat-\ning: “The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All\nWars,” and “Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of\nForegin [sic] Wars, Death Valley post 2884.” The wooden\nsigns are no longer present, and the original wooden cross,\nwhich is no longer standing, has been replaced by private par-\nties several times since 1934. The cross has been an intermit-\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                         11799\ntent gathering place for Easter religious services since as early\nas 1935, and regularly since 1984.\n\n   The current version of the cross was built by Henry San-\ndoz, a local resident, sometime in 1998. When NPS investi-\ngated the history of the cross, Sandoz explained that he drilled\nholes into Sunrise Rock to bolt the cross in place, making it\ndifficult to remove. Sandoz did not receive a permit from NPS\nto construct the cross.\n\n   Following Buono I’s injunction against display of the cross,\nthe cross has been covered by a plywood box. When uncov-\nered, the cross is visible from vehicles traveling on Cima\nRoad, which passes through the Preserve, from a distance of\napproximately 100 yards away. No sign indicates that the\ncross was or is intended to act as a memorial for war veterans.\n\nIII. LITIGATION OVER         THE   CROSS    AND THE    CONGRESSIONAL\nRESPONSE\n\n   The current controversy surrounding the cross surfaced in\n1999, when NPS received a request from an individual seek-\ning to build a “stupa” (a dome-shaped Buddhist shrine) on a\nrock outcropping at a trailhead located near the cross. NPS\ndenied that request, citing 36 C.F.R. § 2.62(a)2 as prohibiting\nthe installation of a memorial without authorization. A hand-\nwritten note on the denial letter warns that “[a]ny attempt to\nerect a stupa will be in violation of Federal Law and subject\nyou to citation and/or arrest.” The letter also indicates that\n“[c]urrently there is a cross on [a] rock outcrop located on\nNational Park Service lands. . . . It is our intention to have the\ncross removed.”\n  2\n    The regulation provides that: “The installation of a monument, memo-\nrial, tablet, structure, or other commemorative installation in a park area\nwithout the authorization of the Director is prohibited.” 36 C.F.R.\n§ 2.62(a).\n\f11800                   BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n   In 1999, NPS undertook a study of the history of the cross.\nNPS determined that neither the cross nor the property on\nwhich it is situated qualifies for inclusion in the National Reg-\nister of Historic Places. Specifically, NPS recognized that the\ncross itself “has been replaced many times and the plaque that\nonce accompanied it (even though it is not known if it is origi-\nnal) has been removed.” Also, the property does not qualify\nas an historical site because, among other things, “the site is\nused for religious purposes as well as commemoration.”\n\n   Following the announcement by NPS of its intention to\nremove the cross, the United States Congress passed a series\nof laws, described below, to preserve the Sunrise Rock cross.\nThe first piece of legislation, enacted in December 2000, pro-\nvided that no government funds could be used to remove the\ncross. See Pub. L. No. 106-554 § 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230\n(2000) (hereafter “§ 133”).3\n\n  A.    Buono I\n\n   Frank Buono4 filed suit in March 2001 against the Secre-\ntary of the DOI, the Regional Director of NPS, and the Super-\nintendent of the Preserve (collectively, “NPS” or\n“Defendants”). The district court concluded that the presence\nof the cross in the Preserve violates the Establishment Clause.\nSee Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 1215-17. In July 2002, the\ncourt entered a permanent injunction ordering that the “De-\nfendants, their employees, agents, and those in active concert\nwith Defendants, are hereby permanently restrained and\n  3\n     “None of the funds in this or any other Act may be used by the Secre-\ntary of the Interior to remove the five-foot-tall white cross located within\nthe boundary of the Mojave National Preserve in southern California first\nerected in 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars along Cima Road\napproximately 11 miles south of Interstate 15.” § 113 (emphasis added).\n   4\n     Buono is a retired NPS employee who worked for the agency from\n1972 to 1997. From September 1994 to December 1995, Buono worked\nas the Assistant Superintendent of the Preserve.\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                        11801\nenjoined from permitting display of the Latin cross in the area\nof Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”5\n\n  B.    DESIGNATION OF THE CROSS AS A NATIONAL MEMORIAL\n\n   In January 2002, while this matter was pending in district\ncourt, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill, which\nincluded a section designating the Sunrise Rock cross as a\n“national memorial.” See Pub.L. No. 107-117 § 8137, 115\nStat. 2278-79 (2002), codified at 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56\n(note) (hereafter “§ 8137”). That section provides:\n\n      (a) DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL MEMORIAL.\n      —The five-foot-tall white cross first erected by the\n      Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States in\n      1934 along Cima Road in San Bernardino County,\n      California, and now located within the boundary of\n      the Mojave National Preserve, as well as a limited\n      amount of adjoining Preserve property to be desig-\n      nated by the Secretary of the Interior, is hereby des-\n      ignated as a national memorial commemorating\n      United States participation in World War I and hon-\n      oring the American veterans of that war.\n\n      (b) LEGAL DESCRIPTION.—The memorial cross\n      referred to in subsection (a) is located at latitude\n      35.316 North and longitude 115.548 West. The exact\n      acreage and legal description of the property to be\n      included by the Secretary of the Interior in the\n  5\n    We granted the government’s motion to stay the injunction pending\nappeal, insofar as the injunction required NPS to immediately remove or\ndismantle the cross. The stay did not apply to any “alternative methods”\nfor complying with, or additional obligations imposed by, the district\ncourt’s order. See Buono II, 371 F.3d at 545 n.1 (discussing stay orders).\nDuring the appeal, NPS covered the cross, first with a large tarpaulin and\nlater with a plywood box, which the government asserts will remain in\nplace pending resolution of this action.\n\f11802               BUONO v.

(emphases added). The cross is designated the “White\nCross World War I Memorial.” 16 U.S.C. § 431 (note).\n\n   NPS is statutorily charged with “the supervision, manage-\nment, and control of the several national parks and national\nmonuments.” 16 U.S.C. § 2. National “memorials” fall within\nthe broader category of national “monuments.” See U.S.C.\n§ 431 (note) (identifying recognized national monuments,\nincluding various categories of “national monuments” and\n“national memorials”).\n\n   In October 2002, less than three months after the district\ncourt’s injunction, in legislation aimed at the Sunrise Rock\ncross, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill that\nincluded a provision barring the use of federal funds “to dis-\nmantle national memorials commemorating United States par-\nticipation in World War I.” Pub. L. No. 107-248 § 8065(b),\n116 Stat.1551 (2002) (hereafter “§ 8065”).\n\n  C.    BUONO II   AND   PASSAGE OF § 8121\n\n   The government appealed the district court’s order and\ninjunction. In September 2003, one month after oral argument\nbefore a panel of our court but before a decision issued, Con-\ngress enacted another defense appropriations bill that included\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                    11803\na land exchange agreement regarding the Sunrise Rock cross.\nSee Pub. L. No. 108-87 § 8121(a)-(f), 117 Stat. 1100 (2003),\ncodified at 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56 (note), (hereafter\n“§ 8121”). The statute provides:\n\n    (a) EXCHANGE REQUIRED.— In exchange for\n    the private property described in subsection (b), the\n    Secretary of the Interior shall convey to the Veterans\n    Home of California— Barstow, Veterans of Foreign\n    Wars Post #385E (in this section referred to as the\n    “recipient”), all right, title, and interest of the United\n    States in and to a parcel of real property consisting\n    of approximately one acre in the Mojave National\n    Preserve and designated (by section 8137 of the\n    Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002\n    (Public Law 107-117; 115 Stat. 2278)) as a national\n    memorial commemorating United States participa-\n    tion in World War I and honoring the American vet-\n    erans of that war. Notwithstanding the conveyance\n    of the property under this subsection, the Secretary\n    shall continue to carry out the responsibilities of the\n    Secretary under such section 8137.\n\n    (b) CONSIDERATION.—As consideration for the\n    property to be conveyed by the Secretary under sub-\n    section (a), Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sandoz of Mountain\n    Pass, California, have agreed to convey to the Secre-\n    tary a parcel of real property consisting of approxi-\n    mately five acres, identified as parcel APN 569-051-\n    44, and located in the west 1/2 of the northeast 1/4\n    of the northwest 1/4 of the northwest 1/4 of section\n    11, township 14 north, range 15 east, San Bernardino\n    base and meridian.\n\n§ 8121(a)-(b) (emphases added). The government retains a\nreversionary interest in the property as follows:\n\n    (e) REVERSIONARY CLAUSE. — The convey-\n    ance under subsection (a) shall be subject to the con-\n\f11804                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n    dition that the recipient maintain the conveyed\n    property as a memorial commemorating United\n    States participation in World War I and honoring the\n    American veterans of that war. If the Secretary\n    determines that the conveyed property is no longer\n    being maintained as a war memorial, the property\n    shall revert to the ownership of the United States.\n\n§ 8121(e) (emphasis added). The cross-reference in § 8121(a)\nto § 8137 pertains to use of federal funds to acquire a replica\ncross and plaque. See § 8197(c). The land transfer was under-\nway when the district court enjoined its enforcement, as\ndescribed below.\n\n   In June 2004, in affirming the district court’s permanent\ninjunction, we held that the presence of the cross in the Pre-\nserve violates the Establishment Clause, agreeing with the\ndistrict court that this case is “squarely controlled” by Separa-\ntion of Church and State Committee v. City of Eugene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724951\"><a href=\"/opinion/724951/96-cal-daily-op-serv-6187-96-daily-journal-dar-10127-separation-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1996) (“SCSC”). Buono II, 371 F.3d at 548.\nIn SCSC, we reasoned that the presence of a cross on city\nland, even where it bore a plaque dedicating the cross as a war\nmemorial to veterans, 93 F.3d at 618, violated the Establish-\nment Clause because “the presence of the cross may reason-\nably be perceived as governmental endorsement of\nChristianity.” Id. at 620.\n\n   The government’s several attempts to distinguish SCSC\nwere not persuasive. For example, we held that it was “of no\nmoment” that the cross in SCSC was significantly taller,\nlocated in an urban area, or illuminated during certain holi-\ndays:\n\n    Though not illuminated, the cross here is bolted to a\n    rock outcropping rising fifteen to twenty feet above\n    grade and is visible to vehicles on the adjacent road\n    from a hundred yards away. Even if the shorter\n    height of the Sunrise Rock cross means that it is visi-\n\f                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                  11805\n    ble to fewer people than was the SCSC cross, this\n    makes it no less likely that the Sunrise Rock cross\n    will project a message of government endorsement.\n    . . . Nor does the remote location of Sunrise Rock\n    make a difference. That the Sunrise Rock cross is not\n    near a government building is insignificant — nei-\n    ther was the SCSC cross. What is significant is that\n    the Sunrise Rock cross, like the SCSC cross, sits on\n    public park land. National parklands and preserves\n    embody the notion of government ownership as\n    much as urban parkland, and the remote location of\n    Sunrise Rock does nothing to detract from that\n    notion.\n\nBuono II, 371 F.3d at 549-50 (emphasis added).\n\n    We also held that a reasonable observer, even without\nknowing whether Sunrise Rock is federally owned, would\nbelieve—or at least suspect—that the cross rests on public\nland because of the vast size of the Preserve, more than 90\npercent of which is federally owned. Id. at 550 (citing reason-\nable observer test set forth in Capitol Square Review & Advi-\nsory Bd. v. Pinette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117966\"><a href=\"/opinion/117966/capitol-squarereview-and-advisory-bd-v-pinette/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 780-81 (1995) (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring)). A reasonably informed observer aware of the\nhistory of the Sunrise Rock cross would know not only that\nthe cross was erected by private individuals (which the gov-\nernment argued favored its view), but also that Congress has\ntaken various measures to preserve the cross, i.e., designating\nit a war memorial, prohibiting use of federal funds to remove\nit, and denying similar access for a Buddhist shrine. Id.\n\n   Acknowledging the passage of § 8121 while the appeal was\npending, we addressed the government’s challenge that\n§ 8121 rendered the appeal moot or would soon do so. We\nrejected the government’s mootness challenge for two rea-\nsons: First, we held that the case was not moot because the\nland transfer had not yet taken effect. Id. at 545. Second,\nbecause “[m]ere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal con-\n\f11806                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nduct does not moot a case,” we held that even if the land trans-\nfer had taken effect, the government still had not carried its\nheavy burden to show mootness. Id. at 546. Even if the land\nwere transferred under § 8121(a), it may revert to the govern-\nment under § 8121(e), or as provided in other statutes. In par-\nticular, we noted that 16 U.S.C. § 431 authorizes\nrelinquishment of lands containing “national monuments” to\nthe federal government, and 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56 autho-\nrizes the Department of the Interior to “acquire all lands and\ninterest in lands within the boundary of the [Mojave] preserve\nby donation, purchase, or exchange.” Id. at 546 (discussing\n§ 8121, 16 U.S.C. §§ 431, 410aaa-56).\n\n  D.    BUONO III\n\n   Despite the injunction against display of the cross in the\nPreserve, the government began moving forward with the\nmechanics of the land exchange under § 8121. Buono then\nmoved to enforce the district court’s prior injunction, or mod-\nify it to prohibit the land exchange as a violation of the Estab-\nlishment Clause. In April 2005, the district court granted\nBuono’s motion to enforce the injunction, and denied as moot\nthe request to amend the permanent injunction. See Buono v.\nNorton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2344226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2344226/buono-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

According to the district court, “the\ntransfer of the Preserve land containing the Latin Cross which\nas [a] sectarian war memorial carries an inherently religious\nmessage and creates an appearance of honoring only those\nservicemen of that particular religion is an attempt by the gov-\nernment to evade the permanent injunction enjoining the dis-\nplay of the Latin Cross atop Sunrise Rock.” Id. at 1182\n(citation and quotation marks omitted). The district court\ndeemed the exchange “invalid” and permanently enjoined the\ngovernment “from implementing the provisions of Section\n8121 of Public Law 108-87” and ordered the government “to\ncomply forthwith with the judgment and permanent injunction\nentered by th[e] court on July 24, 2002.” Id. It is that decision\nthat the government now appeals.\n\f                     BUONO v.

A district court abuses\nits discretion in this regard if “it bases its decision on an erro-\nneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.”\nId.\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\n   In the district court, Buono advanced two alternative argu-\nments challenging the land exchange under § 8121. First,\nBuono argued that the land exchange is an attempt to evade\nthe permanent injunction. Alternatively, he argued that the\nland exchange itself violates the Establishment Clause\nbecause it is an improper governmental endorsement of reli-\ngion. The district court’s holding is grounded only on the first\nbasis, i.e., that the land exchange is a sham transaction with\nthe purpose of permitting continued display of the cross in\nviolation of the permanent injunction. On appeal, the govern-\nment contends that § 8121 was a bona fide attempt by Con-\ngress to comply with the injunction. The government also\nargues that because it was not given the opportunity to fully\neffectuate the transfer, there are unknown facts that render\nthis controversy “unripe” for judicial review.\n\n   Turning first to the government’s ripeness challenge, we\nconclude that this controversy is ripe for review. As to the\nsecond question, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin enforcing the injunction. We agree that the exchange effec-\ntuated by § 8121 violates the injunction, which prohibits the\ndisplay of the Latin cross because it runs afoul of the Estab-\nlishment Clause.\n\nI.   RIPENESS\n\n  Ripeness is a justiciability requirement that seeks to avoid\npremature litigation of disputes. Thomas v. Union Carbide\n\f11808               BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nAgr.

The ripeness question we address is whether it is\npremature to consider a violation of the injunction before\ncompletion of the land exchange.\n\n  A.    CONSTITUTIONAL COMPONENT OF RIPENESS\n\n  The constitutional component of ripeness—that there be an\nArticle III “case or controversy”—requires a concrete impact\nupon the parties arising from the dispute. Union Carbide, 473\nU.S. at 579. This analysis is similar to the injury-in-fact\ninquiry under the standing doctrine. See Anchorage Equal\nRights Comm’n, 220 F.3d at 1138-39.\n\n   The government argues that before litigation proceeds, it\nshould be given an opportunity to try to execute the land\nexchange in compliance with the prior injunction and the gov-\nernment’s constitutional obligations. Buono responds that the\n“concrete” injury ripe for review is that the land transaction’s\nvery structure evidences its lack of a secular purpose and its\neffect continues the government’s improper endorsement of\nreligion that we already held exists.\n\n   This case can best be described as an ongoing controversy\nabout the cross, the specifics of which shift with successive\ncongressional enactments. The controversy is neither prema-\nture nor will it go away on its own. Given the specifics of\n§ 8121, it is no answer to say that the land exchange is not\ncomplete. It is, as the district court notes, “already in prog-\nress,” and the government intends to complete it. Buono III,\n364 F. Supp. 2d at 1178. Buono’s challenge to the present\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11809\nterms of the exchange is not a “hypothetical request[ ] for an\nadvisory opinion.” Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220\nF.3d at 1141.\n\n   The Supreme Court has held that pre-enforcement review\nof a statute is appropriate where the governmental purpose in\nenacting the statute evidences an improper endorsement of\nreligion in violation of the Establishment Clause. See Santa\nFe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118377\"><a href=\"/opinion/118377/santa-fe-independent-school-dist-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313-14 (2000). It\nis no legal leap to conclude that pre-enforcement review is\nsimilarly appropriate where the purpose of a statute is to\nevade an injunction intended to end an ongoing Establishment\nClause violation.\n\n   In Santa Fe, the Supreme Court considered the ripeness of\na facial challenge to a school district’s policy purportedly\nallowing school prayer. Id. The policy permitted students (a)\nto vote on whether there should be a student-delivered invoca-\ntion given at the start of high school football games, and (b)\nto later vote to select the one student who would deliver the\ninvocation at all games throughout the year. Id. at 297-98.\nThe school district argued that it was premature to review the\npolicy because there “can be no certainty that any of the state-\nments or invocations will be religious.” Id. at 313. Rejecting\nthat challenge, the Court concluded that while forcing a stu-\ndent “to participate in religious worship” was a serious consti-\ntutional injury, so too was the “mere passage by [the school\ndistrict] of a policy that has the purpose and perception of\ngovernment establishment of religion. . . . [and] the imple-\nmentation of a governmental electoral process that subjects\nthe issue of prayer to a majoritarian vote.” Id. at 313-14 (rec-\nognizing that “the Constitution also requires that we keep in\nmind ‘the myriad, subtle ways in which Establishment Clause\nvalues can be eroded.’ ”) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). Thus, the\nmere enactment of the policy, particularly in light of the\nschool district’s conduct, was a sufficient constitutional injury\nto warrant pre-enforcement review, and ultimately an injunc-\n\f11810                   BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\ntion against implementation of the policy. Id. at 316.6 Impor-\ntantly, in analyzing ripeness, the Court looked to the history\nof the school district’s conduct in enacting the policy and the\ntrue purpose of the policy. Id. at 314-15.\n\n   The analogy to Santa Fe is apt. Here, both the district court\nand this court have concluded that a grave constitutional\ninjury already exists. The permitting display of the Sunrise\nRock cross in the Preserve is an impermissible governmental\nendorsement of religion. See Buono II, 371 F.3d at 548-50. As\ndiscussed further below, the constitutional injury will persist\nafter—and as a result of—the land exchange effectuated\nunder § 8121. This is so because (among other things) § 8121\nand other applicable statutes7 permit the government’s signifi-\ncant ongoing control of and involvement with the cross and\nthe property on which it is situated. See Santa Fe, 530 U.S.\nat 314-15 (concluding that the text of the school district’s pol-\nicy alone reveals the extent of school involvement in the elec-\ntion of the student speaker and the content of the message to\nbe delivered). And, the government’s repeated actions in pre-\nserving the cross (and forestalling enforcement of the injunc-\ntion) further evidence its goal of keeping the cross in place,\nsee §§ 133, 8137, 8056(b), 8121, just as the school district in\n  6\n     Our cases have similarly held that passage of a statute and putting it\ninto effect (even if the effect is not complete) gives rise to a dispute ripe\nfor judicial review. In Saint Elizabeth Community Hospital v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419676\"><a href=\"/opinion/419676/st-elizabeth-community-hospital-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1983), a church-run hospital challenged the National\nLabor Relations Board’s jurisdiction over it as a violation of the Establish-\nment Clause. Id. at 1440. Congress had amended the National Labor Rela-\ntions Act expressly conferring jurisdiction over nonprofit hospitals without\nexcepting those run by religious institutions. We concluded that the ques-\ntion of NLRB’s jurisdiction was ripe for review. Id. In Assiniboine &\nSioux Tribes of Fort Peck Indian Reservation v.

Id. at 788-89.\n   7\n     See § 8137(a)-(c), 16 U.S.C. §§ 431, 410aaa-56.\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                          11811\nSanta Fe acted with the purpose of maintaining a school pol-\nicy permitting prayer at school events. Santa Fe, 503 U.S. at\n314-15.8\n\n   Buono has alleged a sufficient constitutional injury to over-\ncome any argument that his challenge to § 8121 is unripe. See\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 314-15. The challenge in this case pre-\nsents a concrete injury, rather than an “imaginary” or “specu-\nlative” one.9\n\n  B.    PRUDENTIAL COMPONENT OF RIPENESS\n\n   Even where a concrete case or controversy is present, we\nconsider whether, because of prudential concerns, we should\ndecline to exercise jurisdiction. See Union Carbide, 473 U.S.\nat 581; Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d at 1141.\nWe evaluate two interrelated factors: (a) the hardship that the\nparty seeking relief will suffer from withholding judicial\naction, and (b) the fitness of the issues in the record for judi-\ncial review.

See, e.g., Santa Fe, 530\nU.S. at 314 (permitting facial challenge to school district’s\npolicy prior to enforcement of the policy based largely on the\nCourt’s ability to construe the constitutionality of the policy’s\npurpose as a legal matter); Union Carbide, 473 U.S. at 581\n(granting pre-enforcement review of constitutionality of\nadministrative scheme requiring registrants to participate in\nbinding arbitration of disputes with limited judicial review\nbecause party’s challenge raised solely legal issues).\n\n   Next, we assess the state of the factual record, an inquiry\nthat overlaps with (and in this case collapses into) the third\ncomponent, the finality of the decision.

Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403392\"><a href=\"/opinion/403392/friedman-brothers-investment-company-a-partnership-v-andrew-lindsay-drew/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982). The gov-\n  10\n     Unlike in Anchorage Equal Right Comm’n, where the plaintiffs sought\nreview of a housing law “in a vacuum and in the absence of any particular\nvictims of discrimination,” 220 F.3d at 1142, in this case there is a con-\ncrete victim—Buono—and the statutes are not being analyzed in a vac-\nuum. See, e.g., Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 1181-82 (discussing history\nof government’s preservation efforts regarding the cross).\n\f                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11813\nernment argues that the record is incomplete because certain\nfactual scenarios, as yet unknown, could occur at some time\nin the future. The government illustrates its claim by positing\ntwo potential scenarios that may occur rendering decision on\nthis appeal premature. Upon examination, neither proposed\nscenario persuades us that we should delay decision in this\nmatter.\n\n   First, the government argues that once the land exchange is\ncomplete the VFW might at some point in the future remove\nthe cross, but continue to maintain the property as a “war\nmemorial” as provided under § 8121. Thus, according to the\ngovernment, the court should not decide whether the injunc-\ntion is violated unless and until the land exchange is complete\nand the VFW has an opportunity to decide whether to main-\ntain or remove the cross.\n\n  Under the government’s construction, the dispute would\nnever be ripe because, even if the transfer occurred, the gov-\nernment or the VFW could always argue that removal of the\ncross could occur at some point in the future. Such games-\nmanship is not sanctioned by our prudential ripeness doctrine.\n\n   The government’s view is also at odds with two statutes\nrelated to the Sunrise Rock cross, which, when read together,\ndemonstrate that the VFW cannot remove the cross without\nforfeiting the property to the government. Section 8137(a)\ndesignates “the five-foot-tall white cross” . . . as a “national\nmemorial.” § 8137(a) (emphasis added); see also § 8137(b)\n(referring to “[t]he memorial cross”); 16 U.S.C. § 431 (note)\n(listing “national memorial” titled “White Cross World War\nI Memorial”). In other words, the cross itself is the memorial.\nSection 8121(e) conditions transfer of the land on the VFW’s\nagreement to “maintain the conveyed property as a memorial\ncommemorating United States participation in World War I\nand honoring the American veterans of that war.” § 8121(e).\nSection 8121(e) further provides that if “the conveyed prop-\nerty is no longer being maintained as a war memorial, the\n\f11814               BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nproperty shall revert to the ownership of the United States.”\nId. (emphasis added). Under these two statutes, the VFW’s\nremoval of the cross from Sunrise Rock would trigger the\nreversionary clause of § 8121(e) and the land would revert to\nthe United States. Nothing permits the VFW to destroy a\nnational memorial, remove the cross, and erect a substitute\nmemorial. The entire scheme is directed to preservation of the\ncross.\n\n   To suggest that we do not yet know enough facts to decide\nthis dispute ignores the practical reality of these statutory\nmandates. In Santa Fe, the Court rejected the school district’s\nsimilarly implausible explanations for its conduct, based on\nthe history and context of the school district’s actions:\n\n    The District, nevertheless, asks us to pretend that we\n    do not recognize what every Santa Fe High School\n    student understands clearly — that this policy is\n    about prayer. The District further asks us to accept\n    what is obviously untrue: that these messages are\n    necessary to “solemnize” a football game and that\n    this single-student, year-long position is essential to\n    the protection of student speech. We refuse to turn a\n    blind eye to the context in which this policy arose,\n    and that context quells any doubt that this policy was\n    implemented with the purpose of endorsing school\n    prayer.\n\nSanta Fe, 530 U.S. at 315 (emphasis added).\n\n   The government also argues that DOI might never exercise\nthe reversionary clause, even if the cross is removed. Again,\nthis argument fails as § 8121(e) itself provides that the prop-\nerty “shall revert” if the property is no longer maintained as\na “war memorial,” i.e., the cross under § 8137. Countenanc-\ning this argument would also render the claim perpetually\nunripe, bringing to mind the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\f                         BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                           11815\nAlthough the rule surely does not apply in this context, com-\nmon sense should.\n\n   Even though the transfer itself is not complete, the certainty\nof the governmental action taking place is sufficiently ripe to\nallow review. See, e.g., Friedman, 676 F.2d at 1318-19 (con-\ncluding that challenge to agency’s action as violating National\nEnvironmental Policy Act was ripe where agency had granted\nfunds for project and exempted it from certain of NEPA’s\nrequirements, despite that formal action to acquire the subject\nproperty by condemnation had not yet commenced). Thus,\nnone of the prudential ripeness concerns weigh against our\nrendering a decision.11\n\nII.    VIOLATION OF THE PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n   We next address whether the district court abused its dis-\ncretion in concluding that “transfer of the Preserve land con-\ntaining the Latin Cross, which ‘as [a] sectarian war memorial\ncarries an inherently religious message and creates an appear-\n  11\n    The government raises, for the first time on appeal, a second challenge\nunder the guise of “ripeness.” It argues that the district court exceeded its\npower by issuing a second injunction in the face the government’s effort\nto comply with the original injunction. This is not a true ripeness consider-\nation, but a challenge to the propriety of the district court’s exercise of its\nequitable power to enforce its prior injunction. Because this issue is not\none of justiciability or jurisdiction, the government waived the argument\nby failing to challenge the scope of the district court’s action before that\ncourt. See, e.g., Ritchie v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794703\"><a href=\"/opinion/794703/wayne-ritchie-v-united-states-of-america-robert-v-lashbrook-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1026 & n.12 (9th\nCir. 2006) (concluding that failure to raise an issue before district court\nresulted in waiver on appeal, particularly where the issue involved district\ncourt’s broad discretion and district court “might have been able to\naddress the problem” if raised).

GOVERNMENT ACTION\n\n   In Buono II, we noted that “the presence of a religious sym-\nbol on once-public land that has been transferred into private\nhands may still violate the Establishment Clause.” Buono II,\n371 F.3d at 546 (citing Freedom from Religion Found., Inc.\nv.

In considering that question, we examine both the\nform and substance of the transaction to determine whether\nthe government action endorsing religion has actually ceased.\nSee Marshfield, 203 F.3d at 491.13\n  12\n      In Marshfield, it was undisputed that a white, marble, fifteen-foot\nstatue of Jesus Christ situated on city park land violated the Establishment\nClause. Id. at 489. To remedy the violation, the city sold the statue and a\nsmall parcel of land (0.15 acres) beneath the statue to a private organiza-\ntion that agreed to maintain the land and the statue, including paying for\nthe electrical service used to light the statue. Id. at 490. After concluding\nthat the sale properly ended the government action with respect to the\nstatue and the property, the court determined that the statue’s presence still\nviolated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 495. Based on the historic associ-\nation of the land with the public park, the dedication of the land to use as\na public park through a restrictive covenant, and the physical location and\nvisual perception of the now-private property within the public park, the\ncourt concluded that a reasonable observer would perceive that the statue\nwas on city park property and that it “constitute[d] a City endorsement of\nreligion.” Id. at 495-96.\n   13\n      Although the Seventh Circuit adopted a presumption that “a sale of\nreal property is an effective way for a public body to end its inappropriate\nendorsement of religion” in the absence of “unusual circumstances,” Mar-\nshfield, 203 F.3d at 491, we decline to adopt such presumption. The\nSupreme Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence recognizes the need\n\f                        BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                          11817\n   As did the district court, based on the circumstances of this\ncase, we consider three aspects of the land exchange under\n§ 8121: (1) the government’s continuing oversight and rights\nin the site containing the cross after the proposed land\nexchange; (2) the method for effectuating the land exchange;\nand (3) the history of the government’s efforts to preserve the\ncross.\n\n     1.    CONTINUING GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL\n           OVER THE CROSS AND PRESERVE PROPERTY\n\n  Although Congress sought to transfer the property to the\nVFW, a private entity, the various statutes, when read as a\npackage, evince continuing government control. The follow-\ning summary highlights that control:\n\n     •    NPS retains overall management and supervision\n          of the Preserve.\n\n     •    NPS is responsible for “the supervision, manage-\n          ment, and control” of national memorials.\n\nto conduct a fact-specific inquiry in this area.

NPS is granted statutory powers of\n“supervision, management, and control” of national memori-\nals. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 2, 431. Thus, NPS’s general supervisory\nand managerial responsibilities with respect to the cross\nremain, despite a land transfer. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1 (pro-\nviding that the newly created NPS is responsible for regulat-\ning and promoting “national parks, monuments, and\nreservations . . . by such means and measures as conform to\nthe fundamental purpose” of conservation); 16 U.S.C. § 3\n(“The Secretary of the Interior shall make and publish such\nrules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for\nthe use and management of the parks, monuments, and reser-\nvations under the jurisdiction of [NPS].”).14\n\n  In addition, § 8121(a) expressly reserves NPS’s manage-\nment responsibilities under § 8137. See § 8121(a)\n  14\n     The government does not dispute that the Preserve is under NPS’s\njurisdiction as a unit of the national park system. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 1(c),\n410aaa-41, 410aaa-42, 410aaa-46.\n\f                     BUONO v.

See § 8137(a)-(c). The district court found that these pro-\nvisions gave the government an easement or license over the\nsubject property for this particular purpose. Buono III, 364 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1180. Such an easement or license reflects ongo-\ning control over the property requiring compliance with con-\nstitutional requirements on that land.

As in Hampton and\nEaton, the reversionary clause in § 8121(e) results in ongoing\ngovernment control over the subject property, even after the\ntransfer.\n\f11820                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\n   Although the government argues that reversionary interests\nare run-of-the mill clauses in contracts with the government,\nthe commonality of such clauses does not diminish their\npower or effect. The fact remains that the government has an\nautomatic reversionary interest in the property if it determines\nthat the property is no longer being used as a “war memorial,”\nwhich, at this juncture, is the cross itself. See § 8137. See also\nBuono II, 371 F.3d at 546 (noting the importance of the gov-\nernment’s reversionary interest, and various other mecha-\nnisms by which the government can acquire public lands, in\nconcluding that the dispute had not been rendered moot by\npassage of § 8121).\n\n   As it did with respect to ripeness, the government argues\nthat the court must await exercise of the reversionary interest\nbefore determining whether it is a real factor in government\ncontrol over the property. We reiterate the import of the rever-\nsionary interest; it shows the government’s ongoing control\nover the property and that the parties will conduct themselves\nin the shadow of that control. The courts in Hampton and\nEaton found dispositive the ongoing control resulting from\nthe reversionary interest; their analysis is persuasive here.\n\n   Based on the government’s ongoing supervisory, mainte-\nnance and oversight responsibilities with respect to the cross\nand the property, coupled with the reversionary interest, the\ndistrict court found that the government retains important\nproperty rights in, and “will continue to exercise substantial\ncontrol over,” the property on which Sunrise Rock is located,\neven after the land exchange. Id. at 1179. The government has\nfailed to show that this determination is either clearly errone-\nous or an abuse of discretion.\n\n  2.    METHOD FOR EFFECTUATING THE LAND EXCHANGE\n\n   Next, we examine the method of sale by which § 8121\ntransfers the property to a private buyer outside the normal\nNPS procedures for transfer of parklands. The Secretary of\n\f                    BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11821\nDOI is authorized to exchange federal land for non-federal\nland under its jurisdiction. See 16 U.S.C. § 460l-22(b); see\nalso § 410aaa 56 (authorizing the Secretary to “acquire all\nlands and interest in lands within the boundary of the\n[Mojave] preserve by donation, purchase, or exchange”). In\nthis case, however, the decision to exchange the land was\nmade by Congress and authorized by a provision buried in an\nappropriations bill. The government did not hold a hearing\nbefore enacting such exchange. E.g., id. § 460l-22(b) (provid-\ning that upon request, “prior to such exchange the Secretary\n. . . shall hold a public hearing in the area where the lands to\nbe exchanged are located”). Nor did the government open bid-\nding to the general public. E.g., id. § 460l-22(a). Rather,\n§ 8121 directs that the land be transferred to the VFW, the\norganization that originally installed a cross on Sunrise Rock\nsome years ago and desires the continued presence of the cur-\nrent cross in the Preserve. The private land being exchanged\nfor the federal property is owned by the Sandozes, who con-\nstructed the present cross and who have actively sought to\nkeep the cross on Sunrise Rock. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1180.\n\n   The government argues that, of all parties, the VFW is the\n“logical purchaser” because it originally erected the cross at\nthe site more than seventy years ago. The government cites\nMarshfield and another Seventh Circuit case, Mercier v. Fra-\nternal Order of Eagles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788978\"><a href=\"/opinion/788978/sue-mercier-elizabeth-j-ash-angela-belcaster-v-fraternal-order-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2005). In both\ncases, the respective courts upheld the sale of property to a\nprivate party without an open market bidding process for the\nland. Marshfield, 203 F.3d at 489-90; Mercier, 395 F.3d at\n694-95, 702-03.\n\n   Although neither the exclusion of other purchasers, nor the\nfact that Congress acted outside the scope of normal agency\nprocedures for disposing of federal park land is dispositive,\nboth acts demonstrate the government’s unusual involvement\nin this transaction. These facts, coupled with the govern-\nment’s selection of beneficiaries of the land exchange who\n\f11822                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nhave a significant interest and personal investment in preserv-\ning the cross that has been ordered removed, provide addi-\ntional evidence that the government is seeking to circumvent\nthe injunction in this case. We see no basis to upset the dis-\ntrict court’s conclusion that the VFW was a straw purchaser.\nId. at 1181.\n\n  3. HISTORY      OF    THE   GOVERNMENT’S       PRESERVATION\n  EFFORTS\n\n   Finally, the government’s long-standing efforts to preserve\nand maintain the cross atop Sunrise Rock lead us to the unde-\nniable conclusion that the government’s purpose in this case\nis to evade the injunction and keep the cross in place. In brief,\nwhen litigation was first threatened against NPS, Congress\nbanned the use of government funds to remove the cross\n(§ 133), the first step in forestalling inevitable enforcement of\na federal injunction. After litigation commenced, Congress\ndesignated the cross and adjoining Preserve property as a\nnational memorial commemorating World War I (§ 8137).\nCongress also appropriated up to $10,000 for NPS to acquire\nreplicas of the original cross and plaque at the site (id.), once\nmore trying to bolster the presence of the cross. Once the dis-\ntrict court enjoined display of the cross in Buono I, Congress\nagain prohibited the use of federal funds to remove any World\nWar I memorials (which, obviously, includes the cross)\n(§ 8056(b)); and, while the appeal was pending in Buono II,\nCongress enacted § 8121, directing the transfer of the subject\nproperty to a private organization, but maintaining effective\ngovernment control over the memorial and the use of that\nproperty.\n\n   The government does not contest these legislative\nresponses to various stages of the litigation in this case, or\ntheir purpose aimed at preserving the cross. Rather, the gov-\nernment attempts to diminish their importance. For example,\nthe government argues that § 8137(c), which earmarks funds\nfor the replica plaque and cross, was passed before the district\n\f                     BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE                   11823\ncourt’s injunction and that after the injunction, DOI has taken\nno action to acquire the replicas. While this may be true,\nwhen Congress enacted § 8121, it specifically incorporated\nthe Secretary’s duty to carry out the responsibilities set out in\n§ 8137; Congress did not repeal the funding provisions, or\nany other provision permitting ongoing government control.\nThe funding provisions offer historical evidence of the gov-\nernmental responses aimed at preserving the cross, as well as\nongoing legislative authorizations. In that context, it does not\nmatter whether DOI has exercised its powers to obtain such\nreplicas; the important fact is that Congress directed that it do\nso, further showing its intent to preserve and maintain the\ncross.\n\n   We agree with the district court that the government\nengaged in “herculean efforts” to preserve the cross atop Sun-\nrise Rock. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 1182. We also agree\nthat “the proposed transfer of the subject property can only be\nviewed as an attempt to keep the Latin Cross atop Sunrise\nRock without actually curing the continuing Establishment\nClause violation.” Id.\n\n  B.   CONTINUING GOVERNMENTAL ENDORSEMENT OF\n       RELIGION\n\n   Our inquiry into a purported cure of an Establishment\nClause violation must also analyze whether the improper gov-\nernmental endorsement of religion has ceased. See, e.g., Mar-\nshfield, 203 F.3d at 493-96. Because of the procedural posture\nof this case, we have necessarily already considered that ques-\ntion. We previously held that the presence of the cross in the\nPreserve violates the Establishment Clause. See Buono II, 371\nF.3d at 548-50. We also concluded that a reasonable observer\naware of the history of the cross would know of the govern-\nment’s attempts to preserve it and the denial of access to other\nreligious symbols. Id. at 550. Even a less informed reasonable\nobserver would perceive governmental endorsement of the\nmessage, given that “[n]ational parklands and preserves\n\f11824                BUONO v. KEMPTHORNE\nembody the notion of government ownership,” that the Sun-\nrise Rock area is used as a public campground, and finally,\nbecause of “the ratio of publicly-owned to privately-owned\nland in the Preserve.” Id. Nothing in the present posture of the\ncase alters those earlier conclusions. Under the statutory dic-\ntates and terms that presently stand, carving out a tiny parcel\nof property in the midst of this vast Preserve—like a donut\nhole with the cross atop it—will do nothing to minimize the\nimpermissible governmental endorsement. Nor does the pro-\nposed land exchange under § 8121 end the improper govern-\nment action. Such a transfer cannot be validly executed\nwithout running afoul of the injunction.\n\n   In sum, the government has not shown the district court’s\nfactual findings to be clearly erroneous. Nor has the govern-\nment shown that the district court applied erroneous legal\nstandards. Finally, the district court’s decision does not reflect\nany clear error of judgment. The district court did not abuse\nits discretion in enjoining the government from proceeding\nwith the land exchange under 16 U.S.C. § 8121 and ordering\nthe government to otherwise comply with its prior injunction\nthat it not permit the display of the Sunrise Rock cross in the\nPreserve.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
