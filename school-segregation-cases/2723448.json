Rhodes on behalf of T.L.R., Appellee\n\n\n\n\n             FROM THE COUNTY COURT AT LAW NO. 4 OF TRAVIS COUNTY\n              NO. 262619, HONORABLE MIKE DENTON, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n\n                A student at the Texas School for the Deaf claimed that another student she had been\n\ndating raped her. Both students are minors. After a hearing, the trial court found that dating\n\nviolence had occurred and entered a family-violence protective order. The boy who is subject to the\n\norder appeals, claiming that (1) only an adult member of a dating relationship is entitled to seek a\n\nfamily-violence protective order on the basis of dating violence, and (2) the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the court’s finding that he had committed an act of dating violence.\n\nThe State has filed a motion to dismiss alleging that we are without jurisdiction to review family-\n\nviolence protective orders. We hold that, in the absence of other pending litigation between the\n\nparties, family-violence protective orders are final and appealable, that minors in dating relationships\n\nare entitled to seek such orders, and that there is legally and factually sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe court’s order in this case. We therefore affirm the protective order.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               B.C. and T.L.R. were eighth-grade classmates at the Texas School for the Deaf. They\n\nboth lived on campus during the school year. T.L.R. testified that just prior to the assault, she\n\nconsidered B.C. to be her “boyfriend.”\n\n               After the two had been “dating” for around two weeks, B.C. initiated an unwanted\n\nsexual encounter with T.L.R. One day after school B.C. approached T.L.R. and told her that he\n\nwanted to have sex with her. T.L.R. told him “no” and went into a girls’ restroom to “try to get away\n\nfrom him.” B.C. followed her into the restroom. When he came in she was standing at the far end\n\nof the restroom. She told him, “I don’t want this.” He then approached her and started to take her\n\nclothes off. She did not struggle with him because he had a “really weird look on his face” that\n\nscared her.1 After he had removed all of her clothes, he undressed and told her to “lay down on the\n\nfloor.” Fearful, she complied. B.C. penetrated her. She then pushed him off of her, put her clothes\n\non, and left the restroom. B.C. also got dressed, told T.L.R. not to tell anyone about the incident,\n\nand attempted to hug her before she left. T.L.R. testified that while B.C. was on top of her “[her]\n\nstomach hurt,” and later that day she was scared, could not eat, and her stomach continued to hurt\n\n“real bad.”\n\n               The next day T.L.R. “broke up” with B.C. in the cafeteria, telling him, “This is off.”\n\nSeveral of their classmates were present and B.C. became angry and left. In the days following the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        T.L.R.’s counselor testified that T.L.R. later told her that she was afraid of B.C. during this\nencounter because she knew he had “a tendency to . . . blow up.”\n\n                                                  2\n\frestroom encounter, T.L.R. related what had happened to her to close friends and some school staff\n\nmembers.\n\n               The school initially took steps to protect T.L.R. by putting B.C. in an “alternative\n\neducation program”—which segregated him from the rest of the school—for ten days. A week after\n\nthe incident, however, the school placed the two students on the same bus to take them to their\n\nrespective homes in Waco and Dallas for the weekend. A few weeks after that, T.L.R.’s father\n\nsought to obtain a protective order on her behalf. The court first issued a temporary order, then, after\n\nholding a hearing, issued a final protective order requiring among other things that B.C. refrain from\n\ncommunicating with T.L.R. and her family, from following and harassing T.L.R and her family, and\n\nfrom going within 25 feet of T.L.R.\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\nJurisdiction\n\n               In Bilyeu v. Bilyeu we held that a family-violence protective order rendered during\n\nthe pendency of the parties’ divorce is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal. 86 S.W.3d 278,\n\n282 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.). At that time we expressly reserved “the issue of whether\n\na protective order rendered post-divorce or in the absence of a pending divorce between the parties\n\nis within our jurisdiction to review by appeal.”2 We resolve that issue today.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Because this issue was not before the Bilyeu court, we do not today retreat from the path\ndefined in Bilyeu, as the dissent suggests. Rather we distinguish the lack of finality of a protective\norder issued in the context of a pending divorce which has not disposed of all issues between the\nparties from the finality of other protective orders that dispose of all issues and all parties.\n\n                                                   3\n\f                Family-violence protective orders generally remain in effect for the period stated in\n\nthe order, which cannot exceed two years. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 85.025(a)(1) (West 2002).\n\nSuch orders are valid and enforceable pending further action by the rendering court or until the order\n\nis properly superseded by another court with jurisdiction over the order. See id. § 85.009 (West\n\n2002). The issuing court has the power to modify an existing protective order after notice and\n\nhearing, see id. § 87.001 (West 2002); however, the order generally may not be modified to extend\n\nthe period of its validity beyond two years after the order was rendered. See id. § 87.002 (West\n\n2002).\n\n                Appellate courts have jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments and certain\n\ninterlocutory orders that the legislature has designated appealable. Bilyeu, 86 S.W.3d at 279; see\n\nHinde v. Hinde, 701 S.W.2d 637, 639 (Tex. 1985); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §§ 51.012,\n\n.014 (West 1997 & Supp. 2003). A judgment or order is final if it disposes of all issues and parties.\n\nSee Hinde, 701 S.W.2d at 639; Cooke v. Cooke, 65 S.W.3d 785, 787 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2001, no\n\npet.). Conversely, a judgment or order is interlocutory if it fails to dispose of all issues and parties.\n\nCooke, 65 S.W.3d at 787.\n\n                Many of our sister courts have addressed this jurisdictional issue and concluded that\n\nfamily-violence protective orders are final and appealable. See, e.g., Kelt v. Kelt, 67 S.W.3d 364,\n\n366 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, no pet.); Cooke, 65 S.W.3d at 787-88; Striedel v. Striedel, 15 S.W.3d\n\n163, 164-65 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.); Winsett v. Edgar, 22 S.W.3d 509, 510 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1999, no pet.); James v. Hubbard, 985 S.W.2d 516, 518 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1998, no pet.). The only court in the state to ever hold in a published opinion that these\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fprotective orders are not appealable was the Tenth Court of Appeals in Normand v. Fox. 940 S.W.2d\n\n401, 402-04 (Tex. App.—Waco 1997, no writ). However, that court recently reversed its position\n\nand determined that protective orders are indeed final and appealable judgments. See Kelt, 67\n\nS.W.3d at 366. In Normand, the court had reasoned that because the trial court retains the power to\n\nmodify a protective order, such an order does not settle all disputed issues requiring judicial\n\ndiscretion and is therefore interlocutory. See 940 S.W.2d at 403.\n\n               We disagree with the proposition that the continuing ability to modify a protective\n\norder renders it interlocutory and therefore prevents it from being appealable. An analogy with\n\npermanent injunctions is instructive: a permanent injunction that disposes of all issues and parties\n\nis undoubtedly a final, appealable judgment. See Hubbard, 985 S.W.2d at 517. This is true despite\n\nthe fact that the trial court retains jurisdiction to review, open, vacate, and modify the injunction\n\nupon a showing of changed conditions. See Cooke, 65 S.W.3d at 788. Indeed, it appears that the\n\ntrial court has even broader discretion to modify appealable permanent injunctions than it does\n\nprotective orders. See id. While a trial court may vacate a permanent injunction upon a showing of\n\nchanged conditions, it may not similarly vacate a protective order on the motion of a party until at\n\nleast one year after the order was rendered. Id. (citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 85.025(b)). Instead,\n\nthe trial court’s jurisdiction during the first year of a protective order is limited to modification of\n\nthe order. Id. (citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 87.001).\n\n               As with permanent injunctions, the trial court’s continuing ability to modify a family-\n\nviolence protective order does not convert it from final to interlocutory. See id. It is the disposition\n\nof the parties and the issues—not the retention of jurisdiction—that determines the finality of an\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\forder. See id. The mere fact that an order may someday be modified simply does not suggest that\n\nthe trial court has not finally disposed of all the parties and issues. See id. We hold that a family-\n\nviolence protective order that disposes of all the parties and issues can be appealed despite the\n\ncontinuing jurisdiction of the trial court to modify the order. Because the protective order in this\n\ncase disposed of all the parties and issues, we overrule the State’s motion to dismiss and address the\n\nmerits of the case.3\n\n\nMinors and Dating Violence\n\n               In his first point of error, B.C. argues that only an adult member of a dating\n\nrelationship is entitled to seek a family-violence protective order for dating violence. Because T.L.R.\n\nis a minor, B.C. claims that the court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to issue the protective\n\norder. We disagree with B.C.’s interpretation of the family code.\n\n               The primary rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent\n\nof the legislature.    Southwestern Life Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 24 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2000, pet. denied) (citing Union Bankers Ins. Co. v. Shelton, 889 S.W.2d 278, 280\n\n(Tex. 1994)). If the statute is unambiguous, we are required to seek this intent in the plain and\n\ncommon meaning of its words and not elsewhere. Id. (citing Moreno v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 787\n\n\n       3\n          The Normand court concluded that because protective orders are not appealable, mandamus\nis the appropriate remedy to challenge them. See 940 S.W.2d at 404. We note that neither\nmandamus nor appeal provides for very effective review of protective orders. Mandamus is a more\nexpeditious remedy, but review is limited to an abuse of discretion standard. Conversely, because\nof its short duration, a protective order will often expire before a standard appeal is decided. See id.\nat 404-05 (Vance, J., dissenting). We feel that the most appropriate solution to this problem would\nbe for the legislature to provide for appellate review of family-violence protective orders on an\naccelerated timetable. Cf. id.\n\n                                                   6\n\fS.W.2d 348, 352 (Tex. 1990); Seay v. Hall, 677 S.W.2d 19, 25 (Tex. 1984)). A court may not add\n\nwords to a statute unless necessary to give effect to clear legislative intent. Id. (citing Jones v.\n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co., 745 S.W.2d 901, 902 (Tex. 1988); Meno v. Kitchens, 873 S.W.2d 789, 792\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1994, writ denied)). Furthermore, we must consider the statute as a whole and\n\navoid construing any clause, sentence, or phrase in isolation from the rest of the statute. Id. (citing\n\nMorrison v. Chan, 699 S.W.2d 205, 208 (Tex. 1985)).\n\n                Section 71.004 of the family code defines family violence as\n\n\n       (1) an act by a member of a family or household against another member of the\n           family or household that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury,\n           assault, or sexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in\n           fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault . . . ;\n\n       (2) abuse . . . by a member of a family or household toward a child of the family or\n           household; or\n\n       (3) dating violence, as that term is defined by [s]ection 71.0021.4\n\n\nTex Fam. Code Ann. § 71.004 (West 2002).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Section 71.0021, in turn, defines dating violence as\n\n           an act by an individual that is against another individual with whom that person\n           has or has had a dating relationship [i.e., a continuing relationship of a romantic\n           or intimate nature] and that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury,\n           assault, or sexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the individual\n           in fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 71.0021 (West 2002).\n\n                                                    7\n\f               Section 82.002 sets out who is entitled to seek a protective order:\n\n       (a) With regard to family violence under [s]ection 71.004(1) or (2), an adult\n           member of the family or household may file an application for a protective order\n           to protect the applicant or any member of the applicant’s family or household[.]\n\n\n       (b) With regard to family violence under [s]ection 71.004(3) [i.e., dating violence],\n           an application for a protective order to protect the applicant may be filed by an\n           adult member of the dating relationship.\n\n       (c) Any adult may apply for a protective order to protect a child from family\n           violence.\n\n\nId. § 82.002 (West 2002).\n\n               B.C. interprets section 82.002(b)—which states that an adult member of a dating\n\nrelationship may file an application for a protective order—as being the exclusive statutory\n\nauthorization for filing such an application. His argument entirely ignores section 82.002(c), which\n\nstates that “any adult may apply for a protective order to protect a child from family violence.” Id.\n\nBecause “dating violence” is expressly defined as a type of “family violence,” it follows that any\n\nadult may apply for a protective order to protect a child from dating violence. Section 82.002(b)\n\nactually operates to restrict adults from filing applications for dating-violence protective orders on\n\nbehalf of other adults—something they are entitled to do in some circumstances for other types of\n\nfamily violence under section 82.002(a). See John J. Sampson, et al., Sampson & Tindall’s Texas\n\nFamily Code Annotated § 82.002, cmt. (12th ed. 2002) (“[A]ny adult may apply for a protective\n\norder for the benefit of a child who is the victim of dating violence.”). We overrule the first issue\n\non appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fSufficiency of the Evidence\n\n               At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that B.C. had committed family\n\nviolence against T.L.R. In his second and third points of error, B.C. contends that the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the court’s finding.\n\n               We review legal and factual sufficiency issues in a bench trial using the same\n\nstandards that we use in reviewing such issues following a jury verdict. See K.C. Roofing Co. v.\n\nAbundis, 940 S.W.2d 375, 377 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, writ denied). In considering legal\n\nsufficiency, we consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, indulging\n\nevery inference in that party’s favor. Associated Indem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc., 964 S.W.2d\n\n276, 285-86 (Tex. 1998); Raymond v. Rahme & Williams Invs., 78 S.W.3d 552, 555-56 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2002, no pet.). In reviewing factual sufficiency, we consider all of the evidence and\n\nuphold the finding unless the evidence is too weak to support it or the finding is so against the\n\noverwhelming weight of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. Raymond, 78 S.W.3d at 556. The\n\ntrier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their\n\ntestimony. Id.; Cohn v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline, 979 S.W.2d 694, 696 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.). We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court merely\n\nbecause we might reach a different conclusion. Raymond, 78 S.W.3d at 556; Cohn, 979 S.W.2d at\n\n696.\n\n               As mentioned above, the family code defines dating violence as an act against an\n\nindividual with whom one has or has had a dating relationship—i.e., a continuing relationship of a\n\nromantic or intimate nature—intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fassault, or a threat that reasonably places the individual in fear of imminent physical harm, bodily\n\ninjury, assault, or sexual assault. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 71.004, .0021. B.C. does not challenge\n\nthe court’s finding that he and T.L.R. were involved in a dating relationship; instead, he claims that\n\nthere is legally and factually insufficient evidence to prove that the requisite “act” or “threat”\n\noccurred.\n\n               B.C.’s argument relies on conflicting evidence. Patti McGinnis—one of the staff\n\nmembers in whom B.C. confided—initially testified that B.C. had told her that “they took their\n\nclothes off, she changed her mind and then said ‘no.’” When recalled to explain this testimony,\n\nMcGinnis stated that T.L.R. had told her that T.L.R. helped B.C. remove her clothes; however, the\n\nsubject of whether T.L.R. had ever “changed her mind” was not again discussed.\n\n               T.L.R.’s testimony was different. She claimed that she told B.C. “no” twice before\n\nhe began to undress her, and that she did not help him undress her. Moreover, when T.L.R. was\n\nrecalled after McGinnis testified, T.L.R. explained: “I think [McGinnis] misunderstood me because\n\nof our different signing maybe. I think she misunderstood me because sometimes she doesn’t really\n\nunderstand my signs real well, but what I meant to say was that he took off my clothes.”5\n\n               Making all inferences in favor of the trial court’s finding, as we must, we conclude\n\nthat T.L.R.’s testimony describing B.C.’s forced sexual penetration of her constitutes more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence that B.C. engaged in an act intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury,\n\n\n       5\n           In his factual recitations supporting his second and third points of error, B.C. states that\n“certain witnesses testified through a sign language interpreter resulting in various opportunities for\nconfusion due to the differences between spoken English and American Sign Language.” We find\nlittle evidence of any such confusion. The one ambiguity that did come up was satisfactorily\nclarified by the interpreter.\n\n                                                  10\n\fassault, or sexual assault to T.L.R. Moreover, we cannot say that the evidence is too weak to support\n\nthe court’s finding or that the finding is so against the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to\n\nbe manifestly unjust. As the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given\n\ntheir testimony, the court was entitled to believe T.L.R.’s version of events.

Both students are minors. After a hearing, the trial court found that dating\n\nviolence had occurred and entered a family-violence protective order. The boy who is subject to the\n\norder appeals, claiming that (1) only an adult member of a dating relationship is entitled to seek a\n\nfamily-violence protective order on the basis of dating violence, and (2) the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the court’s finding that he had committed an act of dating violence.\n\nThe State has filed a motion to dismiss alleging that we are without jurisdiction to review family-\n\nviolence protective orders. We hold that, in the absence of other pending litigation between the\n\nparties, family-violence protective orders are final and appealable, that minors in dating relationships\n\nare entitled to seek such orders, and that there is legally and factually sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe court’s order in this case. We therefore affirm the protective order.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               B.C. and T.L.R. were eighth-grade classmates at the Texas School for the Deaf. They\n\nboth lived on campus during the school year. T.L.R. testified that just prior to the assault, she\n\nconsidered B.C. to be her “boyfriend.”\n\n               After the two had been “dating” for around two weeks, B.C. initiated an unwanted\n\nsexual encounter with T.L.R. One day after school B.C. approached T.L.R. and told her that he\n\nwanted to have sex with her. T.L.R. told him “no” and went into a girls’ restroom to “try to get away\n\nfrom him.” B.C. followed her into the restroom. When he came in she was standing at the far end\n\nof the restroom. She told him, “I don’t want this.” He then approached her and started to take her\n\nclothes off. She did not struggle with him because he had a “really weird look on his face” that\n\nscared her.1 After he had removed all of her clothes, he undressed and told her to “lay down on the\n\nfloor.” Fearful, she complied. B.C. penetrated her. She then pushed him off of her, put her clothes\n\non, and left the restroom. B.C. also got dressed, told T.L.R. not to tell anyone about the incident,\n\nand attempted to hug her before she left. T.L.R. testified that while B.C. was on top of her “[her]\n\nstomach hurt,” and later that day she was scared, could not eat, and her stomach continued to hurt\n\n“real bad.”\n\n               The next day T.L.R. “broke up” with B.C. in the cafeteria, telling him, “This is off.”\n\nSeveral of their classmates were present and B.C. became angry and left. In the days following the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        T.L.R.’s counselor testified that T.L.R. later told her that she was afraid of B.C. during this\nencounter because she knew he had “a tendency to . . . blow up.”\n\n                                                  2\n\frestroom encounter, T.L.R. related what had happened to her to close friends and some school staff\n\nmembers.\n\n               The school initially took steps to protect T.L.R. by putting B.C. in an “alternative\n\neducation program”—which segregated him from the rest of the school—for ten days. A week after\n\nthe incident, however, the school placed the two students on the same bus to take them to their\n\nrespective homes in Waco and Dallas for the weekend. A few weeks after that, T.L.R.’s father\n\nsought to obtain a protective order on her behalf. The court first issued a temporary order, then, after\n\nholding a hearing, issued a final protective order requiring among other things that B.C. refrain from\n\ncommunicating with T.L.R. and her family, from following and harassing T.L.R and her family, and\n\nfrom going within 25 feet of T.L.R.\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\nJurisdiction\n\n               In Bilyeu v. Bilyeu we held that a family-violence protective order rendered during\n\nthe pendency of the parties’ divorce is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2352012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2352012/bilyeu-v-bilyeu/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n282 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.). At that time we expressly reserved “the issue of whether\n\na protective order rendered post-divorce or in the absence of a pending divorce between the parties\n\nis within our jurisdiction to review by appeal.”2 We resolve that issue today.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Because this issue was not before the Bilyeu court, we do not today retreat from the path\ndefined in Bilyeu, as the dissent suggests. Rather we distinguish the lack of finality of a protective\norder issued in the context of a pending divorce which has not disposed of all issues between the\nparties from the finality of other protective orders that dispose of all issues and all parties.\n\n                                                   3\n\f                Family-violence protective orders generally remain in effect for the period stated in\n\nthe order, which cannot exceed two years. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 85.025(a)(1) (West 2002).\n\nSuch orders are valid and enforceable pending further action by the rendering court or until the order\n\nis properly superseded by another court with jurisdiction over the order. See id. § 85.009 (West\n\n2002). The issuing court has the power to modify an existing protective order after notice and\n\nhearing, see id. § 87.001 (West 2002); however, the order generally may not be modified to extend\n\nthe period of its validity beyond two years after the order was rendered. See id. § 87.002 (West\n\n2002).\n\n                Appellate courts have jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments and certain\n\ninterlocutory orders that the legislature has designated appealable.

Fox. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1781251\"><a href=\"/opinion/1781251/normand-v-fox/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402-04 (Tex. App.—Waco 1997, no writ). However, that court recently reversed its position\n\nand determined that protective orders are indeed final and appealable judgments. See Kelt, 67\n\nS.W.3d at 366. In Normand, the court had reasoned that because the trial court retains the power to\n\nmodify a protective order, such an order does not settle all disputed issues requiring judicial\n\ndiscretion and is therefore interlocutory. See 940 S.W.2d at 403.\n\n               We disagree with the proposition that the continuing ability to modify a protective\n\norder renders it interlocutory and therefore prevents it from being appealable. An analogy with\n\npermanent injunctions is instructive: a permanent injunction that disposes of all issues and parties\n\nis undoubtedly a final, appealable judgment. See Hubbard, 985 S.W.2d at 517. This is true despite\n\nthe fact that the trial court retains jurisdiction to review, open, vacate, and modify the injunction\n\nupon a showing of changed conditions. See Cooke, 65 S.W.3d at 788. Indeed, it appears that the\n\ntrial court has even broader discretion to modify appealable permanent injunctions than it does\n\nprotective orders. See id. While a trial court may vacate a permanent injunction upon a showing of\n\nchanged conditions, it may not similarly vacate a protective order on the motion of a party until at\n\nleast one year after the order was rendered. Id. (citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 85.025(b)). Instead,\n\nthe trial court’s jurisdiction during the first year of a protective order is limited to modification of\n\nthe order. Id. (citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 87.001).\n\n               As with permanent injunctions, the trial court’s continuing ability to modify a family-\n\nviolence protective order does not convert it from final to interlocutory. See id. It is the disposition\n\nof the parties and the issues—not the retention of jurisdiction—that determines the finality of an\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\forder. See id. The mere fact that an order may someday be modified simply does not suggest that\n\nthe trial court has not finally disposed of all the parties and issues. See id. We hold that a family-\n\nviolence protective order that disposes of all the parties and issues can be appealed despite the\n\ncontinuing jurisdiction of the trial court to modify the order. Because the protective order in this\n\ncase disposed of all the parties and issues, we overrule the State’s motion to dismiss and address the\n\nmerits of the case.3\n\n\nMinors and Dating Violence\n\n               In his first point of error, B.C. argues that only an adult member of a dating\n\nrelationship is entitled to seek a family-violence protective order for dating violence. Because T.L.R.\n\nis a minor, B.C. claims that the court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to issue the protective\n\norder. We disagree with B.C.’s interpretation of the family code.\n\n               The primary rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent\n\nof the legislature.

See 940 S.W.2d at 404. We note that neither\nmandamus nor appeal provides for very effective review of protective orders. Mandamus is a more\nexpeditious remedy, but review is limited to an abuse of discretion standard. Conversely, because\nof its short duration, a protective order will often expire before a standard appeal is decided. See id.\nat 404-05 (Vance, J., dissenting).

App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.). We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court merely\n\nbecause we might reach a different conclusion. Raymond, 78 S.W.3d at 556; Cohn, 979 S.W.2d at\n\n696.\n\n               As mentioned above, the family code defines dating violence as an act against an\n\nindividual with whom one has or has had a dating relationship—i.e., a continuing relationship of a\n\nromantic or intimate nature—intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fassault, or a threat that reasonably places the individual in fear of imminent physical harm, bodily\n\ninjury, assault, or sexual assault. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 71.004, .0021. B.C. does not challenge\n\nthe court’s finding that he and T.L.R. were involved in a dating relationship; instead, he claims that\n\nthere is legally and factually insufficient evidence to prove that the requisite “act” or “threat”\n\noccurred.\n\n               B.C.’s argument relies on conflicting evidence. Patti McGinnis—one of the staff\n\nmembers in whom B.C. confided—initially testified that B.C. had told her that “they took their\n\nclothes off, she changed her mind and then said ‘no.’” When recalled to explain this testimony,\n\nMcGinnis stated that T.L.R. had told her that T.L.R. helped B.C. remove her clothes; however, the\n\nsubject of whether T.L.R. had ever “changed her mind” was not again discussed.\n\n               T.L.R.’s testimony was different. She claimed that she told B.C. “no” twice before\n\nhe began to undress her, and that she did not help him undress her. Moreover, when T.L.R. was\n\nrecalled after McGinnis testified, T.L.R. explained: “I think [McGinnis] misunderstood me because\n\nof our different signing maybe. I think she misunderstood me because sometimes she doesn’t really\n\nunderstand my signs real well, but what I meant to say was that he took off my clothes.”5\n\n               Making all inferences in favor of the trial court’s finding, as we must, we conclude\n\nthat T.L.R.’s testimony describing B.C.’s forced sexual penetration of her constitutes more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence that B.C. engaged in an act intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury,\n\n\n       5\n           In his factual recitations supporting his second and third points of error, B.C. states that\n“certain witnesses testified through a sign language interpreter resulting in various opportunities for\nconfusion due to the differences between spoken English and American Sign Language.” We find\nlittle evidence of any such confusion. The one ambiguity that did come up was satisfactorily\nclarified by the interpreter.\n\n                                                  10\n\fassault, or sexual assault to T.L.R. Moreover, we cannot say that the evidence is too weak to support\n\nthe court’s finding or that the finding is so against the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to\n\nbe manifestly unjust. As the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given\n\ntheir testimony, the court was entitled to believe T.L.R.’s version of events. We overrule B.C.’s\n\nsecond and third issues.6\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n               In the absence of other pending litigation between the parties, family-violence\n\nprotective orders are final and appealable. Adults may apply for a protective order for the benefit\n\nof a child who is the victim of dating violence. We hold that the evidence is legally and factually\n\nsufficient to support the court’s findings in this case and affirm the entry of the protective order.\n\n\n\n\n                                               Bea Ann Smith, Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Law, Justices B. A. Smith and Puryear: Opinion by Justice B. A. Smith;\n  Dissenting Opinion by Chief Justice Law\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: September 11, 2003\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          B.C. also claims that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial\ncourt’s finding that “family violence [is] likely to occur again in the future.” We disagree. T.L.R.\nconsistently testified that she feared B.C. The record contains evidence that, while in his alternative\neducation program, B.C. sent a hostile message to T.L.R. through his friend. Moreover, the fact that\nthe school put T.L.R. and B.C. on the same bus so soon after the incident indicates that it is not\ntaking sufficient care to prevent the recurrence of such an incident.\n\n                                                  11\n\f\f</pre>",
