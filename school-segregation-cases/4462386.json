That radical\n\nproposition is not supported by precedent — instead it requires this Court to\n\nrewrite the plain language of both the controlling statute and the Supreme Court’s\n\nopinion interpreting it.\n\n                           BRIEF OF THE ARGUMENT IN REPLY\n\nI.    Section 21.049 and John cannot be rewritten to change the\n      unambiguous term “parties” to “landowners.”\n\n      Liberal construction does not:\n\n      (i)    rewrite plain language of statutes and Supreme Court holdings;\n             or\n\n      (ii)   deny parties’ right to appeal.\n\nBut that is what Ashcraft is asking this Court to do.\n\n      Lacking case law supporting his contortion of liberal construction, Ashcraft\n\nspends nearly 10,000 words trying to convince this Court to be the first to use the\n\ndoctrine of liberal construction to rewrite section 21.049 to keep condemnors out\n\nof court. Ashcraft’s premise that liberal construction means the landowner can bar\n\nthe courthouse door simply cannot withstand even cursory scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f      A.     The plain language of section 21.049 applies to all “parties,” not\n             just landowners.\n\n      The Legislature’s language precludes rewriting section 21.049 to benefit\n\nonly landowners:\n\n      Not later than the next working day after the day the decision is filed,\n      the clerk shall send notice of the decision by certified or registered\n      United States mail [] to the parties in the proceeding, or to their\n      attorneys…\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE §21.049 (emphasis added).\n\n      Simply    put,   liberal   construction   cannot     change   the   Legislature’s\n\npronouncement that section 21.049 must apply to all “parties” to instead apply to\n\nonly one party – the landowner.        “[E]ven a liberal construction must remain\n\ngrounded in the statute’s language. . . .” Greater Houston P’ship v. Paxton, 468\n\nS.W.3d 51, 62 (Tex. 2015).        When the relevant portion of the provision is\n\nunambiguous, courts may not apply liberal construction, or “any other extra-textual\n\nconstruct” to change its meaning. See id. at 67.\n\n      Section 21.049 is unambiguous. It applies to all “parties.” No construction,\n\n“liberal” or otherwise, can change its plain language.\n\n      B.     The Supreme Court’s holding that section 21.049 tolls the time for\n             the “parties” to object is binding on all courts.\n\n      Ashcraft spends the bulk of his brief alternately:\n\n      (i)    ignoring the Supreme Court’s holding in John that section\n             21.049 tolls filing objection for all “parties”;\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f       (ii)    implying this Court is not bound by the Supreme Court’s\n               “judicially-imposed interpretation” of section 21.049; and\n\n       (iii)   attempting to distinguish John as limited to its facts.\n\nEach argument leads this Court into error.\n\n               1.     The Supreme Court’s holding in John is clear — time for\n                      filing objections is tolled for “parties,” not just landowners.\n\n       There is nothing unclear about the Supreme Court’s holding in John v. State:\n\n       [T]his court holds that, in a condemnation proceeding, the parties’\n       time to object to the special commissioners’ award is tolled until the\n       clerk sends the required notice pursuant to section 21.049 of the\n       Texas Property Code.\n\n826 S.W.2d 138, 139 (Tex. 1992) (emphasis added). Ashcraft’s brief does not\n\nmention the Supreme Court’s holding. Instead his brief focuses on why the Court\n\napplied its holding to the landowner that missed the section 21.018 deadline.\n\nWhile liberal construction certainly supports the Court’s holding, it is hardly\n\nnecessary in order for landowners to be “parties[] [whose] time to object . . . is\n\ntolled until the clerk sends the required notice” prescribed by section 21.049. See\n\nid. The Supreme Court did not hold that “parties” means “only landowners,” or\n\nthat “notice pursuant to section 21.049” means any form of notice. Instead, the\n\nSupreme Court has not wavered from its holding in John that the “parties’” time to\n\nobject is tolled until section 21.049 notice is given.1\n\n\n1 That is why the Supreme Court repeated that jurisdiction over an objection to a condemnation\naward is tolled “if the parties are not given proper notice.” Tex. Dept. of Transp. v. A.P.I. Pipe\nand Supply, LLC, 397 S.W.3d 162, 167 n.18 (Tex. 2013) (citing John, 826 S.W.2d at 141 n.5).\n\n\n                                                3\n\f             2.    The Supreme Court’s interpretation is the law of this State.\n\n      No doubt because John’s holding is both controlling and dispositive,\n\nAshcraft repeatedly implies that this Court is free to ignore it as “a judicial, not a\n\nstatutory, construct” of section 21.049 imposed by the Supreme Court, rather than\n\nby the Legislature. (AppelleeBr:22, 38) (emphasis in original).) But, the Supreme\n\nCourt is the final authority concerning the meaning of all legislation. Its holdings\n\nare the law of this State and are binding on this Court. See In re K.M.S., 91 S.W.3d\n\n331, 331 (Tex. 2002) (per curiam) (admonishing a court of appeals for refusing to\n\nfollow Texas Supreme Court precedent: “courts of appeals are not free to disregard\n\npronouncements from this Court”).\n\n      That is why rather than ignoring John, the court of appeals in Oncor Electric\n\nDelivery Co. v. Schunke, recognized that John controlled its holding that hand-\n\ndelivery of actual notice of a commissioner’s award did not satisfy section 21.049’s\n\nrequirement that the clerk must send notice by certified mail. No. 04-13-00067-\n\nCV, 2013 WL 6672494, at *3-*4 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Dec. 18, 2013, pet.\n\ndism’d) (“[A]ny admission concerning the date the commissioners’ award was\n\nfiled does not change the fact that the time to file objections was tolled until the\n\nclerk mailed notice to the parties or their attorneys as required by section 21.049”).\n\n      This Honorable Court should be wary of any invitation to ignore an\n\nunambiguous Supreme Court holding construing an unambiguous statute.\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      C.    The Supreme Court’s policy that drove John — not allowing\n            procedural technicalities to bar appeals — is not abandoned to\n            benefit landowners.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s holding that section 21.049 tolls the time for “parties”\n\nto object to commissioners’ awards “until the clerk sends the required notice\n\npursuant to section 21.049,” John, 826 S.W.2d at 139, follows the Supreme\n\nCourt’s long-standing policy that “the right of appeal should not be lost due to\n\nprocedural technicalities.” See Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cnty, 341 S.W.3d 919, 924\n\n(Tex. 2011); see also Verburgt v. Dorner, 959 S.W.2d 615, 616 (Tex. 1997) (“This\n\nCourt has never wavered from the principle that appellate courts should not\n\ndismiss an appeal for a procedural defect whenever any arguable interpretation”\n\nwould preserve the appeal.).\n\n      Yet, Ashcraft boldly says that such “liberal constitution (sic) is afforded to\n\nthe landowner, not the condemning party.” (AppelleeBr:44.) The problem of\n\ncourse, is that no court has ever transformed liberal construction that ensures a\n\nlandowner’s appeal, into strict construction to ensure procedural technicalities\n\ndeny an appeal.\n\n      Simply put, section 21.049 says the notice it specifies must be given to the\n\n“parties.” And the Supreme Court squarely held that the “parties’” time to object\n\nis tolled until that notice is given in the form prescribed by section 21.049. There\n\nis no ambiguity in the statute or in the Supreme Court’s holding construing it. And\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fthere is no authority holding to the contrary. This Court should be wary of any\n\nrequest to create such a conflict.\n\nII.      The Supreme Court’s holding in John cannot be distinguished, watered-\n         down, or limited to its facts.\n\n         Ashcraft is thus forced to try to limit John to its facts or create exceptions\n\nwhere none exist.\n\n         A.    The Supreme Court does not write broad holdings for one-of-a-\n               kind cases.\n\n         John’s holding resolved once-and-for-all Ashcraft’s “lynchpin issue” of\n\nwhen timely objections must be made. (See AppelleeBr:31.) So Ashcraft tries to\n\nlimit John to its facts because he does not like the Supreme Court’s holding that\n\nthe parties’ time to object is tolled until the clerk sends the required notice pursuant\n\nto section 21.049. He characterizes John as applying to landowners who receive\n\n“no notice” of a condemnation awards. (AppelleeBr: 22, 23, 28, 34, 47.)\n\n         But the Supreme Court only decides cases with broad significance to the\n\nState’s jurisprudence:\n\n       John’s holding, like section 21.049, expressly applies to all “parties”\n        until notice in the form required by the statute is given; and\n\n       nowhere does John say the landowner had “no notice” of the\n        condemnation award or that other forms of notice will suffice.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      B.    Actual knowledge will not suffice when the form of notice is\n            “mandatory.”\n\n      Ashcraft’s protracted attempt to substitute “actual knowledge” of the\n\ncommissioners’ award for notice in the form required by the Legislature,\n\n(AppelleeBr:35-46), flounders because it must rely on cases in which statutory\n\nnotice provisions are not “regarded as mandatory.” (AppelleeBr:41 (emphasis\n\nadded).)\n\n      In contrast, John turned on the Supreme Court’s holding that “this section\n\nmust be construed as mandatory.” See John at 140 (emphasis added), and n.3.\n\nThus, because “the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it should be\n\nenforced as written.” Id. (emphasis added). “Therefore, in condemnation cases,\n\nthe clerk must comply with the notice provisions.” Id.\n\n            1.     “Reasonable strictness” does not permit substitute forms of\n                   service.\n\n      Thus, Ashcraft cannot change John’s holding by pointing to a footnote\n\nsaying the clerk failed to follow section 21.049’s mailing requirement with\n\n“reasonable strictness.” (AppelleeBr:39 (citing John at 141 n.4.).) The Court’s\n\nreference to “reasonable strictness” in footnote dicta did not say that any other\n\nform of notice can substitute for “the required notice pursuant to section 21.049.”\n\nJohn at 139. Read in context, note 4 creates no such exception:\n\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\f       First, immediately after stating that notice provisions require reasonable\n\nstrictness, the Court held that the clerk “failed to follow the notice requirement\n\nwith reasonable strictness” because the notice required by section 21.049 was sent\n\n“after their time to object had lapsed.” Id. at 141 n.4 (emphasis added). That is\n\nwhat happened here.\n\n       Second, any doubt that reasonable strictness might not require the form of\n\nnotice “required . . . pursuant to section 21.049” was dispelled when the Court\n\nreaffirmed in the next footnote that it was the clerk’s failure to send the notice that\n\ntolls the time to object. Id. at 141 n.5.\n\n              2.    Personal service will not suffice.\n\n       Similarly misplaced is Ashcraft’s reliance on Roccaforte v. Jefferson\n\nCounty, 341 S.W.3d 919 (Tex. 2011) as creating a personal service exception to\n\nsection 21.049’s requirement. (AppelleeBr:39-41.) It misses the mark on two\n\ncritical points.\n\n       First, Roccaforte did not involve section 21.049 and there was no analysis or\n\nholding that the language of the statute in question elevated it from merely\n\n“directive” (which allows alternative compliance) to “mandatory,” (which does not\n\nallow alternative compliance). See John at 140-41.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       Second, Roccaforte is actually an example of how the overarching policy\n\nthat “the right of appeal should not be lost to procedural technicalities” is imposed\n\nto prevent (not to cause) loss of access to the courts. Roccaforte at 924, 926.\n\n       C.    John does not say whether the parties had “no notice.”\n\n       To bolster his claim that actual knowledge should substitute for the\n\n“mandatory” notice in the form prescribed by section 21.049, Ashcraft repeatedly\n\nclaims the landowner in John had no notice of the award. (AppelleeBr:22, 23, 28,\n\n34, 46.) But John says no such thing. If it mattered whether a party had no notice\n\nthe Supreme Court would surely have said so.\n\n       To sum up: both section 21.049 and John are clear and unambiguous. The\n\ntime for filing objections is tolled for all “parties.” No amount of distinguishing or\n\nparsing can alter the clear rule of law intended to clarify the duties of all parties to\n\nensure that rights to appeal will not be lost on procedural technicalities. Ashcraft is\n\ninviting this Court to overrule the Legislature’s unambiguous language and the\n\ncontrolling interpretation by the Supreme Court.\n\nIII.   E-filing is no substitute for compliance with section 21.049.\n\n       Failing to demonstrate that the Legislature did not intend for section 21.049\n\nto apply to both “parties” and that the Supreme Court did not intend for the\n\nstatute’s “mandatory” certified mail notice requirement to “toll” the time for the\n\nstatutes filing objections, Ashcraft claims that the Supreme Court intended for its\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fe-filing Rule of Civil Procedure to trump the Legislature’s requirements in section\n\n21.049. (AppelleeBr:52-56.) Ashcraft’s end-run around, the statute’s “mandatory”\n\nnotice requirement is condemned by these barriers:\n\n      A.      The e-filing rule did not purport to repeal section 21.049.\n\n      Buried at the bottom of footnote 4, Ashcraft’s brief notes the obvious – in a\n\nconflict between statutes and rules, “the statute prevails” unless the rule . . .\n\n“repeals the statute” as provided by section 22.004 of the Texas Government Code.\n\n(AppelleeBr:54 n.4). That did not happen here.\n\n      Under section 22.004 of the Texas Government Code, for a rule to repeal a\n\nstatute the Texas Supreme Court is required to “file with the secretary of state a list\n\nof each article or section of general law or each part of an article or section of\n\ngeneral law that is repealed or modified in any way.” See TEX. GOV’T CODE\n\n§22.004(c).\n\n      Section 21.049 of the Texas Property Code was not included in the list of\n\nstatutes repealed by the adoption of the amendments to Rule 21 of the Texas Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure. See The Supreme Court of Tex., Misc. Docket No. 13-9165,\n\n38 Tex. Reg. 9683, 9683-84 (2013) (adopting amendments to Rule 21 of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure). Accordingly, the mandatory notice requirements of\n\nsection 21.049 control over Rule 21(f)(10) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fSee Few v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 463 S.W.2d 424, 425 (Tex. 1971) (“[Where\n\na] rule of the court conflicts with a legislative enactment, the rule must yield.”).\n\n       Thus, as a matter of law, e-filing did not repeal the mandatory form of notice\n\nrequired by section 21.049. Ashcraft is asking this Court to violate the separation\n\nof powers at the heart of our Constitution.\n\n       B.     There is no evidence of notice by e-service.\n\n       Equally fatal to Ashcraft’s judgment is his inability to point to evidence\n\nsupporting the bogus legal positions he is asking this Court to take.\n\n       First, and most telling, Ashcraft consistently cites only to findings of fact in\n\nresponse to Copano’s challenge that there is no evidence to support those findings\n\nof fact. There is simply no evidence to support Ashcraft’s claim (and the trial\n\ncourt’s findings) that Copano’s counsel received notice of the commissioner’s\n\naward from the clerk by e-service. If such evidence existed it was Ashcraft’s duty\n\nto get it into the record. He did not.\n\n       Second, Ashcraft’s attempt to shift the burden of proof to Copano, to “deny”\n\nhis unproven claim that the clerk e-served notice of the award, (AppelleeBr:43)\n\nshould be seen for what it is – an admission of his failure to satisfy the legal\n\nsufficiency standard of review. Absence of evidence is no evidence.2\n\n2\n  A “case cannot be sustained when it depends wholly upon the failure of defendant, who is\nshown to be in possession of the facts, to disprove plaintiff’s claim. To hold otherwise would be\nto abrogate the rule which places the burden upon a plaintiff to make out his case. Until this\nburden is discharged by evidence produced by plaintiff sufficient prima facie to make out the\n\n                                               11\n\f       Third, Ashcraft violates the fundamental requirements for stipulations by\n\nattempting to transform a “discussion” at a hearing where no record was kept into\n\n“stipulations” memorialized in findings of fact. (AppelleeBr:57.) Stipulations are\n\ngoverned by Rule 11 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See, e.g., Shepherd v.\n\nLedford, 926 S.W.2d 405, 410 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, writ granted) aff’d\n\nand remanded, 962 S.W.2d 28 (Tex. 1998); see also Tutson v. Upchurch, 203\n\nS.W.3d 428, 431 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2006, pet. denied) (providing that a\n\nconcession that did not comport with Rule 11 was unenforceable).                       Rule 11\n\nrequires a stipulation either to be in writing, signed, and filed of record, or made in\n\nopen court and entered of record. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 11.\n\n       “Parties in open court are allowed to narrow the issues presented to the trial\n\ncourt, provided they do so by a signed written agreement that is filed in the trial\n\nrecord. A ‘stipulation’ that is made pursuant to rule 11 is defined as an agreement,\n\nadmission, or concession made in a judicial proceeding by the parties or their\n\nattorneys about a matter that is incident to the trial.” Shepherd, 926 S.W.2d at 410\n\n(internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\ncase alleged by him, the defendant is not required to offer any evidence, and his failure to do so\ncannot, under any circumstances, be regarded as any evidence of the truth of plaintiffs claim.”\nTex. Co. v. Charles Clarke & Co., 182 S.W. 351, 353-54 (Tex. Civ. App. 1915, writ dism’d).\n\n\n                                               12\n\fIV.   There is no uncertainty of title.\n\n      Ashcraft’s ultimate argument, that interpreting section 21.049 and John as\n\nwritten will open the floodgates of “title uncertainty,” is belied by the last quarter\n\ncentury of practice under John (and by common sense). (See AppelleeBr:50-51.)\n\n      Titles are no more uncertain today than they were in 1992 when John tolled\n\nfiling objections until district clerks comply with the mandatory duty imposed by\n\nsection 21.049. The bench and bar alike have long known that the receipt of notice\n\nby certified mail starts the clock for objection. And all parties, in addition to the\n\njudge that appointed the commissioners, have an interest in seeing that the clerk\n\ndoes her job so judicial proceedings can either enter judgment on the award or\n\nchallenge it.\n\n      That is why Copano went to the trouble of literally spelling out the clerk’s\n\nduties in bold-face typeset. (CR:29.) This is not a case of a condemnor laying\n\nbehind a log to achieve some imagined advantage. This case is an attempt to bar\n\nan appeal by using a procedural technicality that was eliminated by the Supreme\n\nCourt nearly 25 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                            CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      Ashcraft failed to produce legally sufficient evidence to support the trial\n\ncourt’s denial of jurisdiction. Denial of jurisdiction was prohibited by the plain\n\nlanguage of section 21.049 and Supreme Court precedent construing it. Copano\n\nwas entitled to rely on the Supreme Court’s unequivocal holding that the time for\n\nfiling objections was tolled for all parties. Mr. Ashcraft is not just inviting this\n\nCourt to snub unambiguous legislation and controlling Supreme Court precedent –\n\nhe is inviting this Court to do so in order to prevent judicial review that is at the\n\nheart of Texas citizens’ rights to judicial redress. The trial court’s judgment and\n\norder must be reversed.\n\n                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                          LOCKE LORD LLP\n\n                                      By: /s/ Charles R. “Skip” Watson, Jr.\n                                         Charles R. “Skip” Watson, Jr.\n                                          State Bar No. 20967500\n                                          cwatson@lockelord.com\n                                         Daniel Durell\n                                          State Bar No. 24078450\n                                          daniel.durell@lockelord.com\n                                         600 Congress Avenue, Suite 2200\n                                         Austin, Texas 78701\n                                         (512) 305-4700 (Telephone)\n                                         (512) 305-4800 (Facsimile)\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f Christopher Dove\n  State Bar No. 24032138\n  cdove@lockelord.com\n Ken McKay\n  State Bar No. 13690835\n  kmckay@lockelord.com\n A.

The judgment was titled “FINAL         the underlying action, and that action proceeds to trial and\nJUDGMENT”; it “denie[d] all relief no [sic] granted in this        a final judgment?

That radical\n\nproposition is not supported by precedent — instead it requires this Court to\n\nrewrite the plain language of both the controlling statute and the Supreme Court’s\n\nopinion interpreting it.\n\n                           BRIEF OF THE ARGUMENT IN REPLY\n\nI.    Section 21.049 and John cannot be rewritten to change the\n      unambiguous term “parties” to “landowners.”\n\n      Liberal construction does not:\n\n      (i)    rewrite plain language of statutes and Supreme Court holdings;\n             or\n\n      (ii)   deny parties’ right to appeal.\n\nBut that is what Ashcraft is asking this Court to do.\n\n      Lacking case law supporting his contortion of liberal construction, Ashcraft\n\nspends nearly 10,000 words trying to convince this Court to be the first to use the\n\ndoctrine of liberal construction to rewrite section 21.049 to keep condemnors out\n\nof court. Ashcraft’s premise that liberal construction means the landowner can bar\n\nthe courthouse door simply cannot withstand even cursory scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f      A.     The plain language of section 21.049 applies to all “parties,” not\n             just landowners.\n\n      The Legislature’s language precludes rewriting section 21.049 to benefit\n\nonly landowners:\n\n      Not later than the next working day after the day the decision is filed,\n      the clerk shall send notice of the decision by certified or registered\n      United States mail [] to the parties in the proceeding, or to their\n      attorneys…\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE §21.049 (emphasis added).\n\n      Simply    put,   liberal   construction   cannot     change   the   Legislature’s\n\npronouncement that section 21.049 must apply to all “parties” to instead apply to\n\nonly one party – the landowner.        “[E]ven a liberal construction must remain\n\ngrounded in the statute’s language. . . .” Greater Houston P’ship v. Paxton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (Tex. 2015).        When the relevant portion of the provision is\n\nunambiguous, courts may not apply liberal construction, or “any other extra-textual\n\nconstruct” to change its meaning. See id. at 67.\n\n      Section 21.049 is unambiguous. It applies to all “parties.” No construction,\n\n“liberal” or otherwise, can change its plain language.\n\n      B.     The Supreme Court’s holding that section 21.049 tolls the time for\n             the “parties” to object is binding on all courts.\n\n      Ashcraft spends the bulk of his brief alternately:\n\n      (i)    ignoring the Supreme Court’s holding in John that section\n             21.049 tolls filing objection for all “parties”;\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f       (ii)    implying this Court is not bound by the Supreme Court’s\n               “judicially-imposed interpretation” of section 21.049; and\n\n       (iii)   attempting to distinguish John as limited to its facts.\n\nEach argument leads this Court into error.\n\n               1.     The Supreme Court’s holding in John is clear — time for\n                      filing objections is tolled for “parties,” not just landowners.\n\n       There is nothing unclear about the Supreme Court’s holding in John v. State:\n\n       [T]his court holds that, in a condemnation proceeding, the parties’\n       time to object to the special commissioners’ award is tolled until the\n       clerk sends the required notice pursuant to section 21.049 of the\n       Texas Property Code.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2451930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2451930/john-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139 (Tex. 1992) (emphasis added). Ashcraft’s brief does not\n\nmention the Supreme Court’s holding. Instead his brief focuses on why the Court\n\napplied its holding to the landowner that missed the section 21.018 deadline.\n\nWhile liberal construction certainly supports the Court’s holding, it is hardly\n\nnecessary in order for landowners to be “parties[] [whose] time to object . . . is\n\ntolled until the clerk sends the required notice” prescribed by section 21.049. See\n\nid. The Supreme Court did not hold that “parties” means “only landowners,” or\n\nthat “notice pursuant to section 21.049” means any form of notice. Instead, the\n\nSupreme Court has not wavered from its holding in John that the “parties’” time to\n\nobject is tolled until section 21.049 notice is given.1\n\n\n1 That is why the Supreme Court repeated that jurisdiction over an objection to a condemnation\naward is tolled “if the parties are not given proper notice.” Tex.

The Supreme Court’s policy that drove John — not allowing\n            procedural technicalities to bar appeals — is not abandoned to\n            benefit landowners.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s holding that section 21.049 tolls the time for “parties”\n\nto object to commissioners’ awards “until the clerk sends the required notice\n\npursuant to section 21.049,” John, 826 S.W.2d at 139, follows the Supreme\n\nCourt’s long-standing policy that “the right of appeal should not be lost due to\n\nprocedural technicalities.” See Roccaforte v.

The problem of\n\ncourse, is that no court has ever transformed liberal construction that ensures a\n\nlandowner’s appeal, into strict construction to ensure procedural technicalities\n\ndeny an appeal.\n\n      Simply put, section 21.049 says the notice it specifies must be given to the\n\n“parties.” And the Supreme Court squarely held that the “parties’” time to object\n\nis tolled until that notice is given in the form prescribed by section 21.049. There\n\nis no ambiguity in the statute or in the Supreme Court’s holding construing it. And\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fthere is no authority holding to the contrary. This Court should be wary of any\n\nrequest to create such a conflict.\n\nII.      The Supreme Court’s holding in John cannot be distinguished, watered-\n         down, or limited to its facts.\n\n         Ashcraft is thus forced to try to limit John to its facts or create exceptions\n\nwhere none exist.\n\n         A.    The Supreme Court does not write broad holdings for one-of-a-\n               kind cases.\n\n         John’s holding resolved once-and-for-all Ashcraft’s “lynchpin issue” of\n\nwhen timely objections must be made. (See AppelleeBr:31.) So Ashcraft tries to\n\nlimit John to its facts because he does not like the Supreme Court’s holding that\n\nthe parties’ time to object is tolled until the clerk sends the required notice pursuant\n\nto section 21.049. He characterizes John as applying to landowners who receive\n\n“no notice” of a condemnation awards. (AppelleeBr: 22, 23, 28, 34, 47.)\n\n         But the Supreme Court only decides cases with broad significance to the\n\nState’s jurisprudence:\n\n       John’s holding, like section 21.049, expressly applies to all “parties”\n        until notice in the form required by the statute is given; and\n\n       nowhere does John say the landowner had “no notice” of the\n        condemnation award or that other forms of notice will suffice.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      B.    Actual knowledge will not suffice when the form of notice is\n            “mandatory.”\n\n      Ashcraft’s protracted attempt to substitute “actual knowledge” of the\n\ncommissioners’ award for notice in the form required by the Legislature,\n\n(AppelleeBr:35-46), flounders because it must rely on cases in which statutory\n\nnotice provisions are not “regarded as mandatory.” (AppelleeBr:41 (emphasis\n\nadded).)\n\n      In contrast, John turned on the Supreme Court’s holding that “this section\n\nmust be construed as mandatory.” See John at 140 (emphasis added), and n.3.\n\nThus, because “the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it should be\n\nenforced as written.” Id. (emphasis added). “Therefore, in condemnation cases,\n\nthe clerk must comply with the notice provisions.” Id.\n\n            1.     “Reasonable strictness” does not permit substitute forms of\n                   service.\n\n      Thus, Ashcraft cannot change John’s holding by pointing to a footnote\n\nsaying the clerk failed to follow section 21.049’s mailing requirement with\n\n“reasonable strictness.” (AppelleeBr:39 (citing John at 141 n.4.).) The Court’s\n\nreference to “reasonable strictness” in footnote dicta did not say that any other\n\nform of notice can substitute for “the required notice pursuant to section 21.049.”\n\nJohn at 139. Read in context, note 4 creates no such exception:\n\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\f       First, immediately after stating that notice provisions require reasonable\n\nstrictness, the Court held that the clerk “failed to follow the notice requirement\n\nwith reasonable strictness” because the notice required by section 21.049 was sent\n\n“after their time to object had lapsed.” Id. at 141 n.4 (emphasis added). That is\n\nwhat happened here.\n\n       Second, any doubt that reasonable strictness might not require the form of\n\nnotice “required . . . pursuant to section 21.049” was dispelled when the Court\n\nreaffirmed in the next footnote that it was the clerk’s failure to send the notice that\n\ntolls the time to object. Id. at 141 n.5.\n\n              2.    Personal service will not suffice.\n\n       Similarly misplaced is Ashcraft’s reliance on Roccaforte v. Jefferson\n\nCounty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541563/roccaforte-v-jefferson-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011) as creating a personal service exception to\n\nsection 21.049’s requirement. (AppelleeBr:39-41.) It misses the mark on two\n\ncritical points.\n\n       First, Roccaforte did not involve section 21.049 and there was no analysis or\n\nholding that the language of the statute in question elevated it from merely\n\n“directive” (which allows alternative compliance) to “mandatory,” (which does not\n\nallow alternative compliance). See John at 140-41.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       Second, Roccaforte is actually an example of how the overarching policy\n\nthat “the right of appeal should not be lost to procedural technicalities” is imposed\n\nto prevent (not to cause) loss of access to the courts. Roccaforte at 924, 926.\n\n       C.    John does not say whether the parties had “no notice.”\n\n       To bolster his claim that actual knowledge should substitute for the\n\n“mandatory” notice in the form prescribed by section 21.049, Ashcraft repeatedly\n\nclaims the landowner in John had no notice of the award. (AppelleeBr:22, 23, 28,\n\n34, 46.) But John says no such thing. If it mattered whether a party had no notice\n\nthe Supreme Court would surely have said so.\n\n       To sum up: both section 21.049 and John are clear and unambiguous. The\n\ntime for filing objections is tolled for all “parties.” No amount of distinguishing or\n\nparsing can alter the clear rule of law intended to clarify the duties of all parties to\n\nensure that rights to appeal will not be lost on procedural technicalities. Ashcraft is\n\ninviting this Court to overrule the Legislature’s unambiguous language and the\n\ncontrolling interpretation by the Supreme Court.\n\nIII.   E-filing is no substitute for compliance with section 21.049.\n\n       Failing to demonstrate that the Legislature did not intend for section 21.049\n\nto apply to both “parties” and that the Supreme Court did not intend for the\n\nstatute’s “mandatory” certified mail notice requirement to “toll” the time for the\n\nstatutes filing objections, Ashcraft claims that the Supreme Court intended for its\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fe-filing Rule of Civil Procedure to trump the Legislature’s requirements in section\n\n21.049. (AppelleeBr:52-56.) Ashcraft’s end-run around, the statute’s “mandatory”\n\nnotice requirement is condemned by these barriers:\n\n      A.      The e-filing rule did not purport to repeal section 21.049.\n\n      Buried at the bottom of footnote 4, Ashcraft’s brief notes the obvious – in a\n\nconflict between statutes and rules, “the statute prevails” unless the rule . . .\n\n“repeals the statute” as provided by section 22.004 of the Texas Government Code.\n\n(AppelleeBr:54 n.4). That did not happen here.\n\n      Under section 22.004 of the Texas Government Code, for a rule to repeal a\n\nstatute the Texas Supreme Court is required to “file with the secretary of state a list\n\nof each article or section of general law or each part of an article or section of\n\ngeneral law that is repealed or modified in any way.” See TEX. GOV’T CODE\n\n§22.004(c).\n\n      Section 21.049 of the Texas Property Code was not included in the list of\n\nstatutes repealed by the adoption of the amendments to Rule 21 of the Texas Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure. See The Supreme Court of Tex., Misc. Docket No. 13-9165,\n\n38 Tex. Reg. 9683, 9683-84 (2013) (adopting amendments to Rule 21 of the Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure). Accordingly, the mandatory notice requirements of\n\nsection 21.049 control over Rule 21(f)(10) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fSee Few v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1724040\"><a href=\"/opinion/1724040/few-v-charter-oak-fire-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (Tex. 1971) (“[Where\n\na] rule of the court conflicts with a legislative enactment, the rule must yield.”).\n\n       Thus, as a matter of law, e-filing did not repeal the mandatory form of notice\n\nrequired by section 21.049. Ashcraft is asking this Court to violate the separation\n\nof powers at the heart of our Constitution.\n\n       B.     There is no evidence of notice by e-service.\n\n       Equally fatal to Ashcraft’s judgment is his inability to point to evidence\n\nsupporting the bogus legal positions he is asking this Court to take.\n\n       First, and most telling, Ashcraft consistently cites only to findings of fact in\n\nresponse to Copano’s challenge that there is no evidence to support those findings\n\nof fact. There is simply no evidence to support Ashcraft’s claim (and the trial\n\ncourt’s findings) that Copano’s counsel received notice of the commissioner’s\n\naward from the clerk by e-service. If such evidence existed it was Ashcraft’s duty\n\nto get it into the record. He did not.\n\n       Second, Ashcraft’s attempt to shift the burden of proof to Copano, to “deny”\n\nhis unproven claim that the clerk e-served notice of the award, (AppelleeBr:43)\n\nshould be seen for what it is – an admission of his failure to satisfy the legal\n\nsufficiency standard of review. Absence of evidence is no evidence.2\n\n2\n  A “case cannot be sustained when it depends wholly upon the failure of defendant, who is\nshown to be in possession of the facts, to disprove plaintiff’s claim. To hold otherwise would be\nto abrogate the rule which places the burden upon a plaintiff to make out his case. Until this\nburden is discharged by evidence produced by plaintiff sufficient prima facie to make out the\n\n                                               11\n\f       Third, Ashcraft violates the fundamental requirements for stipulations by\n\nattempting to transform a “discussion” at a hearing where no record was kept into\n\n“stipulations” memorialized in findings of fact. (AppelleeBr:57.) Stipulations are\n\ngoverned by Rule 11 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

There is no uncertainty of title.\n\n      Ashcraft’s ultimate argument, that interpreting section 21.049 and John as\n\nwritten will open the floodgates of “title uncertainty,” is belied by the last quarter\n\ncentury of practice under John (and by common sense). (See AppelleeBr:50-51.)\n\n      Titles are no more uncertain today than they were in 1992 when John tolled\n\nfiling objections until district clerks comply with the mandatory duty imposed by\n\nsection 21.049. The bench and bar alike have long known that the receipt of notice\n\nby certified mail starts the clock for objection. And all parties, in addition to the\n\njudge that appointed the commissioners, have an interest in seeing that the clerk\n\ndoes her job so judicial proceedings can either enter judgment on the award or\n\nchallenge it.\n\n      That is why Copano went to the trouble of literally spelling out the clerk’s\n\nduties in bold-face typeset. (CR:29.) This is not a case of a condemnor laying\n\nbehind a log to achieve some imagined advantage. This case is an attempt to bar\n\nan appeal by using a procedural technicality that was eliminated by the Supreme\n\nCourt nearly 25 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                            CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      Ashcraft failed to produce legally sufficient evidence to support the trial\n\ncourt’s denial of jurisdiction. Denial of jurisdiction was prohibited by the plain\n\nlanguage of section 21.049 and Supreme Court precedent construing it. Copano\n\nwas entitled to rely on the Supreme Court’s unequivocal holding that the time for\n\nfiling objections was tolled for all parties. Mr. Ashcraft is not just inviting this\n\nCourt to snub unambiguous legislation and controlling Supreme Court precedent –\n\nhe is inviting this Court to do so in order to prevent judicial review that is at the\n\nheart of Texas citizens’ rights to judicial redress.
