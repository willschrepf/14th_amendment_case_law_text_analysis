Andrew Smyser\n      _______________________________________\n\n       Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                   February 1, 2006\nBEFORE: FISHER, ALDISERT and WEIS, CIRCUIT JUDGES\n\n                (Filed February 3, 2006)\n                _____________________\n\n                      OPINION\n               _______________________\n\n\n\n\n                            1\n\fPER CURIAM.\n\n                Kevin Williams, an inmate in the Pennsylvania State Prison system, filed a § 1983\n\ncomplaint in 2001, alleging that the defendants: (1) placed Williams in administrative\n\nsegregation at SCI-Rockview for over four months, without a hearing; (2) verbally harassed\n\nWilliams while he was in administrative segregation; (3) were deliberately indifferent to his\n\nserious psychological needs at a time when he had suicidal thoughts; and (4) fired him from his\n\nprison kitchen job in retaliation for filing grievances against his supervisor, all in violation of his\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He sought damages.\n\n                The Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim. By\n\norder entered June 3, 2002, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Report\n\nrecommending dismissal and, with the exception of the retaliation claim, dismissed all of\n\nWilliams’s claims as to all defendants. The District Court dismissed the due process claim with\n\nprejudice for failure to state a claim because Williams’s 139-day confinement in administrative\n\ncustody did not impose the type of atypical significant deprivation that gives rise to a protected\n\nliberty interest. The District Court also dismissed Williams’s Eighth Amendment harassment\n\nclaim with prejudice, holding that verbal abuse, alone, does not amount to a constitutional\n\ndeprivation under the Eighth Amendment. However, the District Court dismissed without\n\nprejudice Williams’s Eighth Amendment claim of deliberate indifference to his serious\n\npsychological needs because it was not properly pled, and granted Williams leave to file an\n\namended complaint.\n\n                Williams amended his complaint, alleging that while he was incarcerated in\n\nadministrative segregation at SCI-Rockview in April 2001, and on several occasions thereafter,\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fthe defendants denied him psychological treatment that he had requested because he was feeling\n\nsuicidal. Williams also claimed that staff psychologists Walmer and Allen refused his written\n\nrequests for psychological treatment and that his numerous grievances regarding the lack of\n\npsychological treatment were ignored.\n\n               Williams re-alleged his retaliation claim in the Amended Complaint, adding that\n\nin March 2001, he filed a grievance claiming that defendant Emel harassed him and tried to get\n\nhim fired from his prison job hauling kitchen trash. He claimed that Emel then directed other\n\nprison officers to fire Williams. He alleged that Rackovan did nothing about the retaliatory\n\nconduct.\n\n               The District Court denied defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the\n\nAmended Complaint. The Defendants moved for summary judgment. In September 2003, the\n\nDistrict Court denied summary judgment as to the retaliation claim with respect to defendants\n\nMeyer, Sowash, Townsend, Emel, and Rackovan, and granted summary judgment on Williams’s\n\nEighth Amendment claim as to defendants Burke, Meyers, Allen, Walmer, and Wheeler. In\n\ngranting summary judgment, the District Court noted that (1) the Suicidal Risk Indication Check\n\nList, completed three times during Williams’s confinement in administrative segregation (in\n\nApril, June, and July 2001), indicated that Williams did not express suicidal ideation; (2) none of\n\nWilliams’s request slips for psychological treatment mentioned that he had suicidal intentions,\n\nand (3) when he was evaluated by Dr. Burke in August 2001, Williams denied any suicidal\n\nideation, denied any history of suicidal attempts, and refused psychotropic medication, describing\n\nhimself only as depressed and frustrated. Based on the undisputed facts, the District Court held\n\nthat there was no record evidence that the defendants knew that Williams was suicidal.\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f               In October 2003, a jury trial was held before a Magistrate Judge on the retaliation\n\nclaim. At the close of Williams’s case in chief, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter\n\nof law, arguing that Williams had failed to establish that the defendants terminated his job in\n\nretaliation for his pursuit of the grievance process. After considering the testimony and exhibits,\n\nthe District Court granted the motion. On November 4, 2003, judgment was entered against\n\nWilliams and on behalf of all defendants. Williams timely appealed.1\n\n               We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our standard of review of the\n\nDistrict Court’s dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is plenary. “We must determine\n\nwhether, under any reasonable reading of the pleadings, the plaintiffs may be entitled to relief,\n\nand we must accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences\n\nthat can be drawn therefrom.” Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).\n\nWe review de novo an order granting summary judgment. Saldana v. K Mart Corp., 260 F.3d\n\n228, 231 (3d Cir. 2001). Summary judgment is proper when, viewing the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the nonmovant, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party\n\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 232; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The “nonmoving\n\nparty cannot rely upon conclusory allegations in its pleadings or in memoranda and briefs to\n\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact.” Pastore v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania, 24\n\nF.3d 508, 511-12 (3d Cir. 1994). Rather, the nonmoving party “must make a showing sufficient\n\nto establish the existence of every element essential to his case, based on the affidavits or by the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Williams’s appeal from the District Court’s order entered September 2, 2003,\ndocketed as No. 03-3938, was consolidated with his appeal from the final judgment\nentered November 4, 2003.\n\n                                                  4\n\fdepositions and admissions on file.” Harter v. GAF Corp., 967 F.2d 846, 852 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\nFinally, our review of the District Court’s entry of judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. Pro. 50(a) is plenary. Hofkin v. Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 365, 369 (3d Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n               We will affirm the District Court’s judgment as to Williams’s due process and\n\nEighth Amendment claims substantially for the reasons set forth in the Magistrate Judge’s\n\nOpinion filed on May 6, 2002, and in the District Court’s Opinion entered September 2, 2003.\n\nWe will also affirm the District Court’s order granting judgment as a matter of law on Williams’s\n\nretaliation claim, as further discussed below.\n\n               In order to prevail on his retaliation claim at trial, Williams had to prove that the\n\nconduct that led to the alleged retaliation was constitutionally protected, that he suffered some\n\n“adverse action” at the hands of prison officials, and that exercise of the constitutional right was\n\na substantial or motivating factor in the challenged action. Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333-34\n\n(3d Cir. 2001). Prison officials may still prevail by proving that they would have made the same\n\ndecision absent the protected conduct for reasons that are reasonably related to a legitimate\n\npenological interest. Id. at 334.\n\n               We agree with the District Court that there was no legally sufficient evidentiary\n\nbasis for a reasonable jury to find that the defendants retaliated against Williams for pursuing\n\ngrievances about his prison work supervisor. According to Williams’s trial testimony, upon his\n\ntransfer to SCI-Rockview in June 2000, he started working in the kitchen waiting tables in the\n\ncafeteria. Within a month, he was re-assigned to washing pans in the kitchen, and then to\n\nhauling kitchen trash. He received good work reports. Before he filed a grievance about his\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fwork as a kitchen trash hauler, Williams had minor differences with one of his supervisors,\n\ndefendant Emel, over his late appearances for work and his inability to work with other inmates.\n\nAfter Williams filed his complaint in March 2001, Emel continued to raise the same problems\n\nwith Williams’s work. On March 20, 2001, Williams submitted a request slip to his block unit\n\nmanager, Jack Aller, requesting a job change. That same day, he was reassigned to another job in\n\nthe kitchen because he was unable to work with the other inmates on the job. The evidence\n\nshows that Emel’s complaints about Williams’s work predated Williams’s grievance, and thus,\n\nthere is no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find that the exercise of a\n\nconstitutionally protected right was the motivating factor for firing Williams from his old job or\n\nfor re-assigning him to a new one.\n\n               Finally, Williams argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion for\n\nappointment of counsel for purposes of trial. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying counsel. See Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147 (3d Cir. 1993). As the\n\nDistrict Court correctly noted, the case was not complex and expert testimony was not necessary\n\nto make out a case of retaliation.\n\n               We have fully considered the remaining contentions in Williams’s brief and we\n\nfind no merit in any of those contentions. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f\f",

Rauser v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333-34\n\n(3d Cir. 2001). Prison officials may still prevail by proving that they would have made the same\n\ndecision absent the protected conduct for reasons that are reasonably related to a legitimate\n\npenological interest. Id. at 334.\n\n               We agree with the District Court that there was no legally sufficient evidentiary\n\nbasis for a reasonable jury to find that the defendants retaliated against Williams for pursuing\n\ngrievances about his prison work supervisor. According to Williams’s trial testimony, upon his\n\ntransfer to SCI-Rockview in June 2000, he started working in the kitchen waiting tables in the\n\ncafeteria. Within a month, he was re-assigned to washing pans in the kitchen, and then to\n\nhauling kitchen trash. He received good work reports. Before he filed a grievance about his\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fwork as a kitchen trash hauler, Williams had minor differences with one of his supervisors,\n\ndefendant Emel, over his late appearances for work and his inability to work with other inmates.\n\nAfter Williams filed his complaint in March 2001, Emel continued to raise the same problems\n\nwith Williams’s work. On March 20, 2001, Williams submitted a request slip to his block unit\n\nmanager, Jack Aller, requesting a job change. That same day, he was reassigned to another job in\n\nthe kitchen because he was unable to work with the other inmates on the job. The evidence\n\nshows that Emel’s complaints about Williams’s work predated Williams’s grievance, and thus,\n\nthere is no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find that the exercise of a\n\nconstitutionally protected right was the motivating factor for firing Williams from his old job or\n\nfor re-assigning him to a new one.\n\n               Finally, Williams argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion for\n\nappointment of counsel for purposes of trial. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying counsel. See Tabron v. Grace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654205\"><a href=\"/opinion/654205/harvey-tabron-v-lt-grace-lieutenant-major-price-correct-officer-gross/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1993). As the\n\nDistrict Court correctly noted, the case was not complex and expert testimony was not necessary\n\nto make out a case of retaliation.\n\n               We have fully considered the remaining contentions in Williams’s brief and we\n\nfind no merit in any of those contentions. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f\f</pre>",
