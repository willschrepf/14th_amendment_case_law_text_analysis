HUFF, DIRECTOR OF FINANCE, has requested\nan opinion on the following question:\n\n             Which year is a school district's \"base year\" for purposes of receiving state\nreimbursement of voluntary desegregation costs?\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n               A school district's \"base year\" for purposes of receiving state reimbursement of\nvoluntary desegregation costs is the 1984-1985 fiscal year if the district incurred desegregation costs\naudited and approved by the Controller for that year. If the district initiated its desegregation\nprogram after the 1984-1985 fiscal year, its \"base year\" is its first fiscal year of implementing its\ndesegregation plan.\n\n                                             ANALYSIS\n\n                Education Code section 422491 authorizes local school districts to submit claims to\nthe state for the reimbursement of the costs of desegregating their schools. Subdivision (a) of\nsection 42249 states:\n\n                 \"Any school district which maintains a voluntary program designed to\n        remedy the harmful effects of racial segregation may, if the program meets the\n        criteria of this section, present a claim for reimbursement for the costs of the program\n        . . . .\"\n\nSection 42247 places a limit upon the amount that the state will reimburse a district each year for\nits desegregation costs. The limit is stated as a percentage of the costs incurred by the district during\n\n\n   1\n    All unidentified section references hereafter are to provisions of the Education Code.\n\n                                                   1.                                          89-1204\n\n\fa prior year commonly known as the \"base year.\" The amount of the base year costs restricts all\nfuture annual claims to be paid by the state. Section 42247 provides:\n\n               \"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, reimbursements authorized\n       by Section . . . 42249 for desegregation costs incurred in the 1985-86 fiscal year, and\n       each fiscal year thereafter, shall not exceed the following amounts:\n\n               \".......................\n\n                (2) For desegregation programs initiated after the 1984-85 fiscal year, the\n       amount in excess of one-fifth of the audited costs approved by the Controller for the\n       first full year of operation, adjusted pursuant to Section 42247.2, and provided that\n       the school district has contributed in the prior fiscal year not less than one-fifth of the\n       audited costs approved by the Controller for that fiscal year. For purposes of this\n       paragraph, desegregation programs initiated after the 1984-85 fiscal year shall not\n       include expansion of desegregation activities by school districts that were reimbursed\n       pursuant to Section 42249 for desegregation costs incurred during the 1984-85 fiscal\n       year, except as otherwise provided by Section 42247.2.\n\n               \"(3) For all other desegregation programs, the amount in excess of one-fifth\n       of the audited desegregation costs approved by the Controller and incurred in the\n       1984-85 fiscal year, adjusted pursuant to Section 42247.2, and provided that the\n       school district has contributed in the prior fiscal year not less than one-fifth of the\n       audited costs approved by the Controller for that fiscal year.\n\n               \"(b) Claims for reimbursement of desegregation program costs shall be\n       subject to audit by the Controller to determine all or the following:\n\n               \"(1) Whether the costs and programs are for purposes of desegregation or\n       alleviation of the harmful effects of racial segregation, as provided in the plan filed\n       by the district pursuant to Section 42247.1.\n\n             \"(2) Whether the costs are increased costs which exceed the district's\n       expenditure levels for regular educational programs.\n\n               \"(3) Whether the costs are excessive or unreasonable.\" (Emphases added.)2\n\n                The question presented for analysis concerns the determination of a school district's\nbase year for purposes of section 42247. Which prior year of the district is the one upon which all\nfuture reimbursement claims must be calculated? We conclude that the base year is the 1984-1985\nfiscal year unless the district initiated its desegregation program thereafter, in which case the base\nyear becomes the first fiscal year of implementing its desegregation plan.\n\n                 Preliminarily, we note that \"[c]laims for reimbursement of desegregation program\ncosts shall be subject to audit by the Controller to determine . . . [w]hether the costs are excessive\nor unreasonable.\" (§ 42247, subd. (b)(3).) This statutory mandate is consistent with other legislative\ndirectives for the Controller to audit all claims prior to the payment of state funds. (See Gov. Code,\n§§ 925.6, 12410.) We have previously concluded that the Controller's authority to audit claims filed\n\n   2\n   The adjustments authorized by section 42247.2 allow increases for inflation and for increased\nenrollment (average daily attendance).\n\n                                                   2.                                            89-1204\n\fagainst the state's treasury is constitutionally based. (71 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 275 (1988).) \"Money\nmay be drawn from the Treasury only through an appropriation made by law and upon a Controller's\nduly drawn warrant.\" (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 7; see Flournoy v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 350, 354\n[\"The obvious purpose of this requirement is to insure the Controller's concurrence in the\nexpenditure of state funds\"].)\n\n                 If it is found that the district incurred desegregation costs for the 1984-1985 fiscal\nyear and its claim for that year has been audited and approved by the Controller, that ends the\ninquiry. The state reimbursement program does not cover the \"expansion of desegregation activities\nby school districts that were reimbursed pursuant to section 42249 for desegregation costs incurred\nduring the 1984-85 fiscal year, except as otherwise provided by Section 42247.2.\" (§ 42247, subd.\n(a)(2).) Reading subdivision (a)(2) in light of subdivision (a)(3), we do not believe that a district\nmay \"terminate\" its 1984-1985 desegregation activities and \"initiate\" a new program thereafter. A\ndistrict that has \"audited desegregation costs approved by the Controller and incurred in the 1984-85\nfiscal year\" (§ 42247, subd. (a)(3)) has already initiated its program by the 1984-1985 fiscal year,\nand \"initiation\" is a one-time event. The base year for the district would thus be the 1984-1985\nfiscal year under subdivision (a)(3) of section 42247.\n\n              If the Controller finds that a school district did not incur desegregation costs during\nthe 1984-1985 fiscal year, he must determine which year is the district's \"first full year of operation.\"\n(§ 42247, subd. (a)(2).) This phrase could have several meanings. One interpretation would be the\nfirst twelve month period for which a school district incurs desegregation costs in initiating a\nprogram. Another would be the first school year in which a desegregation plan is being\nimplemented, including any changes in attendance patterns. Does the term \"operation\" include the\nplanning and organizational stages of a desegregation program?\n\n                 In addressing this issue, we note that the Controller is to audit claims for\nreimbursement to determine \"[w]hether the costs and programs are for purposes of desegregation\nor alleviation of the harmful effects of racial segregation, as provided in the plan filed by the district\npursuant to Section 42247.1.\" (§ 42247, subd. (b)(1).) Section 42247.1 requires a district to \"submit\nto the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Controller a copy of the district's desegregation\nplan . . . .\" The Superintendent of Public Instruction has adopted regulations (Cal. Code of Regs.,\ntit. 5, §§ 90-101) concerning a district's formulation of a desegregation plan, including stages for\nidentifying the district's segregated schools, obtaining community involvement in and support of\ndesegregation activities, holding public hearings on ways to implement the desegregation of schools,\nproviding in-service training for staff, and making curriculum reforms for the enhancement of\nquality integrated education. Many of these desegregation activities may occur prior to any changes\nin attendance patterns.\n\n               In construing the language of section 42247, we are \"to ascertain the intent of the\nLegislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\" (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &\nHousing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386.) \"In doing so we look first to the words of the statute,\ngiving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\" (Committee of Seven Thousand v. Superior Court\n(1988) 45 Cal.3d 491, 501.)\n\n               The term \"operation\" commonly means \"doing or performing of a practical work or\nof something involving practical application of principles or processes . . . the quality or state of\nbeing functional or operative . . . capacity for action or functioning.\" (Webster's New International\nDict. (3d ed. 1966) p. 1581.)\n\n               We believe that by use of the phrase \"first full year of operation\" in section 42247,\nthe Legislature intended for a school district's base year to begin when it begins to implement its\n\n                                                   3.                                           89-1204\n\n\fdesegregation plan. Prior to that time, the program may have been \"initiated\" and may have incurred\ncosts but is not \"operational\" or \"functioning\" as a practical matter. While the planning and\norganizational stages are necessary prerequisites to the carrying out of a program's goals and\npurposes, they do not signify that the plan is being \"executed\" through attendance pattern changes.\nIn this regard, the phrase \"first full year of operation\" may be distinguished from such other phrases\nused in the statute as \"desegregation costs\" and \"desegregation activities.\" The latter two phrases\nwould encompass the time, effort, and funds expended by a district in initiating a desegregation\nprogram.\n\n                Normally the legislative history of a statute is helpful in construing ambiguous\nlanguage so as to effectuate the Legislature's intent. (See Long Beach Police Officers' Assn. v. City\nof Long Beach (1988) 466 Cal.3d 736, 743; People v. Jeffers (1987) 43 Cal.3d 984, 993.) Here, the\nlegislative history respecting the enactment of section 42247 (Stats. 1985, ch. 180, § 1) does not\nshed light on the meaning of the phrase \"first full year of operation.\" However, when section 42247\nwas amended in 1987 (Stats. 1987, ch. 259, § 2), the Legislature amended another statute to treat\na similar problem faced by school districts operating desegregation programs under federal court\norders. As explained in the report of the Senate Rules Committee:\n\n               \"ANALYSIS: Existing law (AB 38, Ch. 180, 1985):\n\n               \".......................\n\n              \"2. Provides that 1985-86 be used for the base year for future funding of\n       desegregation claims under court orders that became final prior to January 1, 1986.\n       (Problem: On December 31, 1985, San Jose Unified School District was given a\n       court order to desegregate. The district spent the second semester of 1985-86\n       preparing for the relocation of students which began in the 1986-87 school year,\n       making 1986-87 its first year of full implementation.)\n\n               \".......................\n\n               \"This bill:\n\n               \".......................\n\n               \"2. Permits districts being reimbursed for desegregation costs under a federal\n       court order final before January 1, 1986, but not implemented until 1985-86, to be\n       reimbursed for their 1985-86 costs (half-year) and to use their first full year of costs\n       (1986-87) as the base year for future funding. (Under current law, the base year is\n       1985-86.)\"\n\nOther statements in the committee reports are consistent with this declaration of legislative purpose\nthat the first full year of operation (the base year) begins with the actual implementation of a\ndesegregation plan, not with the plan preparation and organizational stages. This legislative history\nalso demonstrates that the base year is the first fiscal year of implementation.\n\n                 We reject the argument that the first full year of operation begins when all the\nstudents have been reassigned under a district's voluntary desegregation program. This construction\nof subdivision (a)(2) of section 42247 misplaces the word \"full.\" Also, this proposed construction\nwould be contrary to the Legislature's intent as evidenced by its prohibition against reimbursing a\ndistrict's costs for the \"expansion of desegregation activities.\" (§ 42247, subd. (a)(2).)\n\n\n                                                  4.                                          89-1204\n\n\f                Finally, the administrative procedure is for a district to submit an estimated cost claim\nat the beginning of a fiscal year. (See § 42249.2, subd. (c).) The Controller pays the claim and then\nperforms an audit and \"approves\" the claim after the fiscal year has closed. It is possible that a claim\nwill be readjusted once it has been audited; the Controller in fact may disapprove it entirely. For\npurposes of section 42247, it is not the amount initially paid by the Controller that is critical in\nsetting the base year limit; rather, it is \"the audited costs approved by the Controller\" (subd. (a)(2))\nor \"the audited desegregation costs approved by the Controller\" (subd. (a)(3)) upon which all future\ncomputations must be based.3\n\n                In answer to the question presented, therefore, we conclude that a school district's\nbase year for purposes of receiving state reimbursement of voluntary desegregation costs is the\n1984-1985 fiscal year if the district incurred desegregation costs audited and approved by the\nController for that year. If the district initiated its desegregation program after the 1984-1985 fiscal\nyear, its base year is its first fiscal year of implementing its desegregation plan.\n\n                                               *****\n\n\n\n\n  3\n   The request for our opinion included an example of a school district that had been paid $181,000\nfor its 1984-1985 fiscal year claim. The Controller subsequently audited the claim and rejected it\nbecause no costs had been incurred for that year. Under these circumstances the district's base year\nwould not be the 1984-1985 fiscal year.\n\n                                                   5.                                          89-1204\n\f",

For purposes of this\n       paragraph, desegregation programs initiated after the 1984-85 fiscal year shall not\n       include expansion of desegregation activities by school districts that were reimbursed\n       pursuant to Section 42249 for desegregation costs incurred during the 1984-85 fiscal\n       year, except as otherwise provided by Section 42247.2.\n\n               \"(3) For all other desegregation programs, the amount in excess of one-fifth\n       of the audited desegregation costs approved by the Controller and incurred in the\n       1984-85 fiscal year, adjusted pursuant to Section 42247.2, and provided that the\n       school district has contributed in the prior fiscal year not less than one-fifth of the\n       audited costs approved by the Controller for that fiscal year.\n\n               \"(b) Claims for reimbursement of desegregation program costs shall be\n       subject to audit by the Controller to determine all or the following:\n\n               \"(1) Whether the costs and programs are for purposes of desegregation or\n       alleviation of the harmful effects of racial segregation, as provided in the plan filed\n       by the district pursuant to Section 42247.1.\n\n             \"(2) Whether the costs are increased costs which exceed the district's\n       expenditure levels for regular educational programs.\n\n               \"(3) Whether the costs are excessive or unreasonable.\" (Emphases added.)2\n\n                The question presented for analysis concerns the determination of a school district's\nbase year for purposes of section 42247. Which prior year of the district is the one upon which all\nfuture reimbursement claims must be calculated? We conclude that the base year is the 1984-1985\nfiscal year unless the district initiated its desegregation program thereafter, in which case the base\nyear becomes the first fiscal year of implementing its desegregation plan.\n\n                 Preliminarily, we note that \"[c]laims for reimbursement of desegregation program\ncosts shall be subject to audit by the Controller to determine . . . [w]hether the costs are excessive\nor unreasonable.\" (§ 42247, subd. (b)(3).) This statutory mandate is consistent with other legislative\ndirectives for the Controller to audit all claims prior to the payment of state funds. (See Gov. Code,\n§§ 925.6, 12410.) We have previously concluded that the Controller's authority to audit claims filed\n\n   2\n   The adjustments authorized by section 42247.2 allow increases for inflation and for increased\nenrollment (average daily attendance).\n\n                                                   2.                                            89-1204\n\fagainst the state's treasury is constitutionally based. (71 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 275 (1988).) \"Money\nmay be drawn from the Treasury only through an appropriation made by law and upon a Controller's\nduly drawn warrant.\" (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 7; see Flournoy v. Priest (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382963/flournoy-v-priest/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354\n[\"The obvious purpose of this requirement is to insure the Controller's concurrence in the\nexpenditure of state funds\"].)\n\n                 If it is found that the district incurred desegregation costs for the 1984-1985 fiscal\nyear and its claim for that year has been audited and approved by the Controller, that ends the\ninquiry. The state reimbursement program does not cover the \"expansion of desegregation activities\nby school districts that were reimbursed pursuant to section 42249 for desegregation costs incurred\nduring the 1984-85 fiscal year, except as otherwise provided by Section 42247.2.\" (§ 42247, subd.\n(a)(2).) Reading subdivision (a)(2) in light of subdivision (a)(3), we do not believe that a district\nmay \"terminate\" its 1984-1985 desegregation activities and \"initiate\" a new program thereafter. A\ndistrict that has \"audited desegregation costs approved by the Controller and incurred in the 1984-85\nfiscal year\" (§ 42247, subd. (a)(3)) has already initiated its program by the 1984-1985 fiscal year,\nand \"initiation\" is a one-time event. The base year for the district would thus be the 1984-1985\nfiscal year under subdivision (a)(3) of section 42247.\n\n              If the Controller finds that a school district did not incur desegregation costs during\nthe 1984-1985 fiscal year, he must determine which year is the district's \"first full year of operation.\"\n(§ 42247, subd. (a)(2).) This phrase could have several meanings. One interpretation would be the\nfirst twelve month period for which a school district incurs desegregation costs in initiating a\nprogram. Another would be the first school year in which a desegregation plan is being\nimplemented, including any changes in attendance patterns. Does the term \"operation\" include the\nplanning and organizational stages of a desegregation program?\n\n                 In addressing this issue, we note that the Controller is to audit claims for\nreimbursement to determine \"[w]hether the costs and programs are for purposes of desegregation\nor alleviation of the harmful effects of racial segregation, as provided in the plan filed by the district\npursuant to Section 42247.1.\" (§ 42247, subd. (b)(1).) Section 42247.1 requires a district to \"submit\nto the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Controller a copy of the district's desegregation\nplan . . . .\" The Superintendent of Public Instruction has adopted regulations (Cal. Code of Regs.,\ntit. 5, §§ 90-101) concerning a district's formulation of a desegregation plan, including stages for\nidentifying the district's segregated schools, obtaining community involvement in and support of\ndesegregation activities, holding public hearings on ways to implement the desegregation of schools,\nproviding in-service training for staff, and making curriculum reforms for the enhancement of\nquality integrated education. Many of these desegregation activities may occur prior to any changes\nin attendance patterns.\n\n               In construing the language of section 42247, we are \"to ascertain the intent of the\nLegislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\" (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &\nHousing Com. (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604071\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604071/dyna-med-inc-v-fair-employment-housing-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1386.) \"In doing so we look first to the words of the statute,\ngiving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\" (Committee of Seven Thousand v. Superior Court\n(1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1172018\"><a href=\"/opinion/1172018/committee-of-seven-thousand-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501.)\n\n               The term \"operation\" commonly means \"doing or performing of a practical work or\nof something involving practical application of principles or processes . . . the quality or state of\nbeing functional or operative . . . capacity for action or functioning.\" (Webster's New International\nDict. (3d ed. 1966) p. 1581.)\n\n               We believe that by use of the phrase \"first full year of operation\" in section 42247,\nthe Legislature intended for a school district's base year to begin when it begins to implement its\n\n                                                   3.                                           89-1204\n\n\fdesegregation plan. Prior to that time, the program may have been \"initiated\" and may have incurred\ncosts but is not \"operational\" or \"functioning\" as a practical matter. While the planning and\norganizational stages are necessary prerequisites to the carrying out of a program's goals and\npurposes, they do not signify that the plan is being \"executed\" through attendance pattern changes.\nIn this regard, the phrase \"first full year of operation\" may be distinguished from such other phrases\nused in the statute as \"desegregation costs\" and \"desegregation activities.\" The latter two phrases\nwould encompass the time, effort, and funds expended by a district in initiating a desegregation\nprogram.\n\n                Normally the legislative history of a statute is helpful in construing ambiguous\nlanguage so as to effectuate the Legislature's intent. (See Long Beach Police Officers' Assn. v. City\nof Long Beach (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 743; People v.

Here, the\nlegislative history respecting the enactment of section 42247 (Stats. 1985, ch. 180, § 1) does not\nshed light on the meaning of the phrase \"first full year of operation.\" However, when section 42247\nwas amended in 1987 (Stats. 1987, ch. 259, § 2), the Legislature amended another statute to treat\na similar problem faced by school districts operating desegregation programs under federal court\norders. As explained in the report of the Senate Rules Committee:\n\n               \"ANALYSIS: Existing law (AB 38, Ch. 180, 1985):\n\n               \".......................\n\n              \"2. Provides that 1985-86 be used for the base year for future funding of\n       desegregation claims under court orders that became final prior to January 1, 1986.\n       (Problem: On December 31, 1985, San Jose Unified School District was given a\n       court order to desegregate. The district spent the second semester of 1985-86\n       preparing for the relocation of students which began in the 1986-87 school year,\n       making 1986-87 its first year of full implementation.)\n\n               \".......................\n\n               \"This bill:\n\n               \".......................\n\n               \"2. Permits districts being reimbursed for desegregation costs under a federal\n       court order final before January 1, 1986, but not implemented until 1985-86, to be\n       reimbursed for their 1985-86 costs (half-year) and to use their first full year of costs\n       (1986-87) as the base year for future funding. (Under current law, the base year is\n       1985-86.)\"\n\nOther statements in the committee reports are consistent with this declaration of legislative purpose\nthat the first full year of operation (the base year) begins with the actual implementation of a\ndesegregation plan, not with the plan preparation and organizational stages. This legislative history\nalso demonstrates that the base year is the first fiscal year of implementation.\n\n                 We reject the argument that the first full year of operation begins when all the\nstudents have been reassigned under a district's voluntary desegregation program. This construction\nof subdivision (a)(2) of section 42247 misplaces the word \"full.\" Also, this proposed construction\nwould be contrary to the Legislature's intent as evidenced by its prohibition against reimbursing a\ndistrict's costs for the \"expansion of desegregation activities.\" (§ 42247, subd. (a)(2).)\n\n\n                                                  4.                                          89-1204\n\n\f                Finally, the administrative procedure is for a district to submit an estimated cost claim\nat the beginning of a fiscal year. (See § 42249.2, subd. (c).) The Controller pays the claim and then\nperforms an audit and \"approves\" the claim after the fiscal year has closed. It is possible that a claim\nwill be readjusted once it has been audited; the Controller in fact may disapprove it entirely. For\npurposes of section 42247, it is not the amount initially paid by the Controller that is critical in\nsetting the base year limit; rather, it is \"the audited costs approved by the Controller\" (subd. (a)(2))\nor \"the audited desegregation costs approved by the Controller\" (subd. (a)(3)) upon which all future\ncomputations must be based.3\n\n                In answer to the question presented, therefore, we conclude that a school district's\nbase year for purposes of receiving state reimbursement of voluntary desegregation costs is the\n1984-1985 fiscal year if the district incurred desegregation costs audited and approved by the\nController for that year. If the district initiated its desegregation program after the 1984-1985 fiscal\nyear, its base year is its first fiscal year of implementing its desegregation plan.\n\n                                               *****\n\n\n\n\n  3\n   The request for our opinion included an example of a school district that had been paid $181,000\nfor its 1984-1985 fiscal year claim. The Controller subsequently audited the claim and rejected it\nbecause no costs had been incurred for that year. Under these circumstances the district's base year\nwould not be the 1984-1985 fiscal year.\n\n                                                   5.                                          89-1204\n\f</pre>",
