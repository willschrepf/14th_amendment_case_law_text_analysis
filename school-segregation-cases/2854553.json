Kathleen Koszola sued the Board\nof Education of the City of Chicago under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., for refus-\ning to hire her for a full-time teaching position because she\nis white. The Board moved for summary judgment at the\nclose of discovery. Citing the dearth of facts in Koszola’s\nsubmissions pursuant to Northern District of Illinois Local\nRule 56.1, the district court granted the Board’s motion. We\naffirm, as Koszola has provided no evidence showing that\nshe may have suffered discrimination.\n\f2                                                No. 03-2428\n\n                              I\n   Koszola’s rocky tenure with the Board began in 1994. While\npursuing her bachelor’s degree in teaching at Northeastern\nIllinois University, Koszola spent a semester as a student\nteacher at the Dirksen Elementary School, a Chicago public\nschool. After she graduated in 1995, Koszola served as a\nsubstitute teacher for the Board at a number of public\nschools on the North Side of Chicago, located in Regions 1,\n2, and 3 of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system. Koszola\nnever served as a substitute teacher in any school located\non Chicago’s South Side, which is divided into Regions 4, 5,\nand 6. Between 1995 and 1997, Koszola applied for a\nnumber of full-time teaching positions with the CPS, but\nshe limited her search to schools on the City’s North and\nNorthwest Sides. The Board never hired her for any of these\npositions.\n  In 1997, while she was serving as a substitute teacher at\nthe Howe School, located on the City’s West Side in Region\n2, Koszola’s car was vandalized. After that negative ex-\nperience, she refused all assignments at Howe, despite the\nBoard’s policy requiring substitute teachers to accept all as-\nsignments. The Board’s manager of substitute teacher as-\nsignments, Ursula Anderson, repeatedly attempted to\ncontact Koszola after this incident, but she did not respond.\nAnderson then demoted Koszola. On April 28, 1997, Koszola\nsent a resignation letter to the Board, stating: “I refuse to\nwork on the West or South Side. I want to work on the\nNorthwest Side, but the Board of Education says I am the\nwrong color. I don’t need this aggravation. I give up teaching.\nYou win. Go hire all the blacks and foreigners to balance the\nemployment. I am not going to endanger my life anymore.”\nFrom August 1999 through June 2002, Koszola again applied\nunsuccessfully for CPS teaching positions in schools on the\nNorth and Northwest Sides.\n  Since 1980, the Board’s faculty hiring and assignment\nprocess for the CPS has been governed by a federal consent\ndecree arising from a lawsuit brought by the Department of\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                 3\n\nJustice alleging that the Board maintained a racially\nsegregated school system in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause. The decree provides for “the establishment of the\ngreatest practicable number of stably desegregated schools,\nconsidering all the circumstances in Chicago,” and, to that\nend, calls for integration of both the student bodies and\nfaculty of the CPS. With respect to faculty assignments, the\ndecree requires that “[t]he Board will promptly implement\na plan to assure that the assignment of full-time classroom\nteachers to schools will be made in such a manner that no\nschool is identified as intended for students of a particular\nrace.” The decree dictates that “with respect to the full-time\nclassroom teachers in each school faculty, the racial/ethnic\ncomposition and the proportion of experienced teachers will\nbe plus and minus fifteen percent of the systemwide\nproportions of such teachers with respect to such character-\nistics, and the range of educational training will be substan-\ntially the same as exists in the system as a whole.”\n  On April 17, 2001, Koszola filed a complaint against the\nBoard in federal district court alleging racial discrimination\nin violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., and the Equal Protection Clause.\nSpecifically, she alleged that her applications for full-time\nemployment with the CPS had “continually been rejected or\nnot considered by Defendant because she is Caucasian.”\nAfter discovery closed, the Board successfully moved for\nsummary judgment. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                             II\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it\n“shall be an unlawful employment practice for an em-\nployer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\nindividual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such individ-\n\f4                                                 No. 03-2428\n\nual’s race . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). To prevail on her\nrace discrimination claim, Koszola must either show direct\nevidence of discriminatory motive or intent or rely on the\nindirect burden-shifting method outlined in McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). The district\ncourt found that Koszola could not prevail under either\napproach. We review a district court’s decision to grant\nsummary judgment de novo. McDonald v. Vill. of Winnetka,\n371 F.3d 992, 1001 (7th Cir. 2004). In doing so, we construe\nall facts and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts\nin favor of the non-moving party. Id.\n  In reviewing Koszola’s Title VII claim, the district court\nconsidered only those facts included in the parties’ Local\nRule 56.1 statements of material fact, a decision that\nKoszola challenges on appeal. Under the Local Rules of the\nNorthern District of Illinois, a party filing a motion for sum-\nmary judgment under FED. R. CIV. P. 56 must serve and file\n“a statement of material facts as to which the moving party\ncontends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the\nmoving party to a judgment as a matter of law.” N.D. Ill.\nLocal R. 56.1(a)(3). Further, Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(A)\nrequires that the non-moving party file a reply, including “a\nresponse to each numbered paragraph in the moving party’s\nstatement, including, in the case of any disagreement, specific\nreferences to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other\nsupporting materials relied upon.” The reply must also\ninclude “any additional facts that require the denial of sum-\nmary judgment,” with appropriate references to the record.\nId. at 56.1(b)(3)(B). Finally, Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) pro-\nvides that “[a]ll material facts set forth in the statement\nrequired of the moving party will be deemed to be admitted\nunless controverted by the statement of the opposing party.”\nThis court reviews the decision of a district court concerning\ncompliance with local rules, such as Rule 56.1, only for an\nabuse of discretion. Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc.,\n368 F.3d 809, 817 (7th Cir. 2004).\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                  5\n\n   To establish the set of facts that were properly before the\ndistrict court, a brief review of the procedural history of the\ncase is in order. On July 11, 2002, the Board filed its Local\nRule 56.1(a) Statement of Facts, listing 54 paragraphs of\nallegedly undisputed facts. Among these was Paragraph 29,\nwhich stated: “Koszola does not know the name, qualifi-\ncations, date of assignment, or otherwise have any personal\nknowledge regarding any persons who were assigned to full-\ntime positions which she sought with the Chicago Public\nSchools.” On September 20, 2002, Koszola filed her Local\nRule 56.1(b) response, in which she admitted that she “[did]\nnot dispute these facts” in paragraphs 1-54 of the Board’s\nfiling. She then provided additional statements of fact,\nincluding Paragraph 57, which stated: “With respect to\nDefendant’s 29, Plaintiff identifies the persons who were\nhired in her place at Oriole Park by a black female from\nTexas, Hitch by a black female from Georgia, Canty by an\nHispanic male teacher, Sayre Academy by a black female by\nthe name of Ms. Smith.” At the Board’s motion, the court\nstruck a number of paragraphs from Koszola’s response and\naccompanying affidavit, including Paragraph 57 on the\nground that it “inherently contradicts facts in the Board’s\nstatement” that Koszola had admitted. In particular, her\nidentification in Paragraph 57 of specific schools that had\nallegedly hired nonwhite teachers and the races of those\nhired contradicted her admission of the Board’s Paragraph\n29. The court then granted Koszola five days to resubmit\nher Local Rule 56.1(b) statement and supporting affidavit.\n  On November 20, 2002, Koszola submitted a revised Local\nRule 56.1(b) statement and affidavit, which omitted the\nparagraphs stricken by the district court. Inexplicably,\nKoszola again admitted all the factual statements in the\nBoard’s original Local Rule 56.1(a) statement, including\nParagraph 29. In addition, she replaced the text of Paragraph\n57 in her response with the following: “In the fall of 1996 at\na public school Plaintiff was substituting regularily (sic) the\n\f6                                                No. 03-2428\n\nprincipal apologized to plaintiff for never interviewing\nplaintiff. She explained that she was forced to hire a mi-\nnority and she told Plaintiff that Plaintiff was eight times\nbetter than the candidate she had. The principle (sic) nodded\nto a young black female, identifying her as the one she\nhired for the position.” Koszola also attached an affidavit\nrecounting several instances in which principals at certain\nChicago public schools indicated that they would consider\nonly minority candidates, but she did not include this\ninformation in her Rule 56.1(b) response.\n   In granting the Board’s motion for summary judgment,\nthe court explained that it had considered only the facts in\nthe parties’ Local Rule 56.1 Statements of Material Facts,\nas it was entitled to do. See Bordelon v. Chi. Sch. Reform\nBd. of Trs., 233 F.3d 524, 529 (7th Cir. 2000). Therefore,\nKoszola’s only evidence of discrimination that the court\nconsidered was Paragraph 57 of her November response,\nwhich recounted an unidentified principal’s comment that\nshe was “force[d] to hire a minority.” On appeal, Koszola ar-\ngues that the court should also have considered Paragraph 57\nof her September response, which listed specific schools that\nhad hired nonwhite teachers and the races of these hires.\nWe find no error in the court’s exclusion of this latter\nparagraph because, as the district court indicated, it\n“inherently contradict[ed] facts in the Board’s statement,”\nthe entirety of which Koszola had admitted. See Andrews v.\nBranch 11 Nat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers Union, No.\n01 C 3434, 2002 WL 483408, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29, 2002)\n(“[T]he Court will disregard Plaintiffs’ additional facts to\nthe extent they contradict a fact Plaintiffs also admit.”); cf.\nUnited States v. Kasuboski, 834 F.2d 1345, 1350 (7th Cir.\n1987) (“Affidavits and depositions entered in opposition to\nsummary judgment that attempt to establish issues of fact\ncannot refute default admissions.”).\n  Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\nlimiting its review to the content of the parties’ Local Rule\n56.1 statements, excluding from consideration Koszola’s\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                   7\n\nattached affidavits. “[W]e have emphasized the importance\nof local rules and have consistently and repeatedly upheld\na district court’s discretion to require strict compliance with\nits local rules governing summary judgment.” Metro. Life\nIns. Co. v. Johnson, 297 F.3d 558, 562 (7th Cir. 2002) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Ammons, 368 F.3d at 817\n(same); Waldridge v. Am. Hoechst Corp., 24 F.3d 918, 922\n(7th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases). This means that a district\ncourt is entitled “to decide the motion based on the factual\nrecord outlined in the [Local Rule 56.1] statements.”\nMarkham v. White, 172 F.3d 486, 490 (7th Cir. 1999); see\nMidwest Imports, Ltd. v. Coval, 71 F.3d 1311, 1316 (7th Cir.\n1995) (finding the court did not abuse its discretion in\ndeclining to consider a non-movant’s affidavits because “it\nis a reasonable judgment on the part of the district court\nthat strict, consistent, ‘bright-line’ enforcement is essential\nto obtaining compliance with [Local Rule 56.1] and to\nensuring that long-run aggregate benefits in efficiency\ninure to district courts”). As the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in limiting its review of Koszola’s Local Rule\n56.1 statements and her supplemental materials, our de\nnovo review of its grant of summary judgment will likewise\nrest only on the Board’s Local Rule 56.1(a) statement and\nKoszola’s November Local Rule 56.1(b) response.\n  On this record, Koszola has failed to carry her burden with\nrespect to her Title VII claim. Under the direct method of\nproving discrimination, Koszola had to show either through\ndirect or circumstantial evidence that the Board’s decision\nto not to hire her was motivated by an impermissible pur-\npose, such as her race. See Adams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\n324 F.3d 935, 938-39 (7th Cir. 2003). “Direct evidence\nessentially requires an admission by the decision-maker\nthat his actions were based on the prohibited animus.”\nRadue v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 219 F.3d 612, 616 (7th Cir.\n2000). “A plaintiff can also prevail under the direct method\nof proof by constructing a ‘convincing mosaic’ of circumstan-\n\f8                                                No. 03-2428\n\ntial evidence that allows a jury to infer intentional discrimi-\nnation by the decisionmaker. That circumstantial evidence,\nhowever, must point directly to a discriminatory reason for\nthe employer’s action.” Rhodes v. Ill. Dep’t of Transp., 359\nF.3d 498, 504 (7th Cir. 2004) (internal citation and quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  As we are limited to the contents of Koszola’s November\nLocal Rule 56.1(b) response, the only evidence related to\ndiscrimination that we may consider is the statement in her\nrevised Paragraph 57 quoted above, about the “forced”\nhiring of a minority candidate. The district court refused to\nconsider this statement on the ground that it “lacks proper\nevidentiary foundation.” The basis for this conclusion is not\nentirely clear, as we would expect this statement to be\nadmissible under FED. R. EVID. 801(d)(2)(D) as the admis-\nsion of a party-opponent, that is, “a statement by the party’s\nagent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of\nthe agency or employment, made during the existence of the\nrelationship.” Yet even if Paragraph 57 is properly before\nus, it is not sufficient to permit Koszola to recover under the\ndirect method. Koszola filed her Local Rule 56.1 statement\nafter the close of discovery, yet the only evidence of discrim-\nination included in her statement consisted of this assertion\nthat an unidentified principal at a unidentified Chicago\npublic school told her that she was “eight times better” than\nan unidentified African-American hire. There is no evidence\nin the record showing that Koszola ever attempted to depose\nthis principal, to identify the teacher hired, or to establish\nthe teacher’s qualifications. Furthermore, this statement is\ninconsistent with Koszola’s admission that she “does not\nknow the name, qualifications, date of assignment, or\notherwise have any personal knowledge regarding any\npersons who were assigned to full-time positions which she\nsought with the Chicago Public Schools.”\n  For this same reason, Koszola cannot prevail under the\nindirect burden-shifting method outlined in McDonnell\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                    9\n\nDouglas. Under this approach, a plaintiff must present evi-\ndence tending to show: (1) she was a member of a protected\nclass; (2) she applied for, and was qualified for, an open\nposition; (3) the employer rejected her for the position; and\n(4) the employer filled the position with an individual out-\nside of the plaintiff’s protected class, or the position remained\nvacant. Bennett v. Roberts, 295 F.3d 687, 694 (7th Cir. 2002).\nAt that point, the defendant has a chance to articulate a\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; if it does\nso, the plaintiff must offer evidence showing that the\ndefendant’s reason is pretextual. Id. at 694-95. As the Board\nhas conceded that Koszola has satisfied the first three\nelements of McDonnell Douglas, we need only consider the\nlast part. In Greer v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of Chi., 267\nF.3d 723 (7th Cir. 2001), we indicated that the showing re-\nquired under the fourth element of McDonnell Douglas must\ntake the federal consent decree into account, and that a\nplaintiff would have “to show, at minimum, that the Board\nallowed teachers of another race to work at schools even if\ntheir presence would have contributed to a racial imbalance\namong that school’s faculty.” Id. at 728.\n  We need not decide here exactly how the consent decree\nmight affect Koszola’s case, because she presented no evi-\ndence that might have shown a violation of the decree’s\nguidelines. In her Local Rule 56.1(b) statement, Koszola ad-\nmitted that she can identify only five schools by name “at\nwhich she was told that an African-American or Hispanic\nteacher was hired for a full-time position at or near the\ntimes she sought a full-time position at the individual school.”\nShe further admitted that five of these schools were not\nwithin the +/- 15% compliance guidelines during the rele-\nvant time period, with nonwhite faculty underrepresented\nat all five schools. In addition, she admitted that she “does\nnot know the name of any of the five minority teachers that\nshe was told were hired [at these schools], nor does she\nknow anything about their teaching skills and qualifica-\n\f10                                                 No. 03-2428\n\ntions.” Koszola also identified a sixth school at which an\nAsian-American was allegedly hired for a position in which\nKoszola had expressed interest, but she produced no evidence\nshowing that this hire contributed to a racial imbalance in\nthe school’s faculty. Moreover, in her Local Rule 56.1(b)\nresponse, she admitted that the principal at the school “did\nnot hire Koszola for a full-time position because, based on\nher performance as a student teacher, he perceived that she\nlacked the skills necessary to be an effective teacher . . . [and\nhad] deficient classroom management and lesson-planning\nskills.” In the absence of evidence that “the Board allowed\nteachers of another race to work at schools even if their\npresence would have contributed to a racial imbalance\namong that school’s faculty,” Koszola could not make out a\nprima facie case under McDonnell Douglas assuming that\nthe consent decree informs the inquiry. See Greer, 267 F.3d\nat 728.\n  Treating this as a straightforward Title VII case, Koszola\nalso loses. She has not identified a nonwhite comparator\nwho was hired by the schools to which she applied and who\nis similarly situated to her in all material respects. With\nrespect to the five nonwhite hires, Koszola has conceded\nthat she does not “know anything about their teaching skills\nand qualifications.” Likewise, Koszola has admitted that she\ndoes not “know the name, qualifications, date of assignment,\nor otherwise have any personal knowledge regarding any\npersons who were assigned to full-time positions which she\nsought with the Chicago Public Schools.” There is no evi-\ndence in the record showing that Koszola attempted to\nobtain this information from the Board or other sources. As\nwe have often stated, summary judgment “is the ‘put up or\nshut up’ moment in a lawsuit, when a party must show\nwhat evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to\naccept its version of events.” Johnson v. Cambridge Indus.,\nInc., 325 F.3d 892, 901 (7th Cir. 2003) (quoting Schacht v.\nWis. Dep’t of Corr., 175 F.3d 497, 504 (7th Cir. 1999)).\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                 11\n\nKoszola’s evidence falls woefully short. She has failed to pro-\nvide the court with any information regarding the individuals\nallegedly hired in her stead, other than their race, and she\nhas made several damaging admissions confirming that she\nlacks such information. Koszola has thus failed to establish a\ngenuine issue of material fact on the question whether the\nBoard discriminated against her.\n\n\n                             III\n  For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n\nA true Copy:\n       Teste:\n\n                         ________________________________\n                         Clerk of the United States Court of\n                           Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                    USCA-02-C-0072—10-8-04\n\f",

Kathleen Koszola sued the Board\nof Education of the City of Chicago under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., for refus-\ning to hire her for a full-time teaching position because she\nis white. The Board moved for summary judgment at the\nclose of discovery. Citing the dearth of facts in Koszola’s\nsubmissions pursuant to Northern District of Illinois Local\nRule 56.1, the district court granted the Board’s motion. We\naffirm, as Koszola has provided no evidence showing that\nshe may have suffered discrimination.\n\f2                                                No. 03-2428\n\n                              I\n   Koszola’s rocky tenure with the Board began in 1994. While\npursuing her bachelor’s degree in teaching at Northeastern\nIllinois University, Koszola spent a semester as a student\nteacher at the Dirksen Elementary School, a Chicago public\nschool. After she graduated in 1995, Koszola served as a\nsubstitute teacher for the Board at a number of public\nschools on the North Side of Chicago, located in Regions 1,\n2, and 3 of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system. Koszola\nnever served as a substitute teacher in any school located\non Chicago’s South Side, which is divided into Regions 4, 5,\nand 6. Between 1995 and 1997, Koszola applied for a\nnumber of full-time teaching positions with the CPS, but\nshe limited her search to schools on the City’s North and\nNorthwest Sides. The Board never hired her for any of these\npositions.\n  In 1997, while she was serving as a substitute teacher at\nthe Howe School, located on the City’s West Side in Region\n2, Koszola’s car was vandalized. After that negative ex-\nperience, she refused all assignments at Howe, despite the\nBoard’s policy requiring substitute teachers to accept all as-\nsignments. The Board’s manager of substitute teacher as-\nsignments, Ursula Anderson, repeatedly attempted to\ncontact Koszola after this incident, but she did not respond.\nAnderson then demoted Koszola. On April 28, 1997, Koszola\nsent a resignation letter to the Board, stating: “I refuse to\nwork on the West or South Side. I want to work on the\nNorthwest Side, but the Board of Education says I am the\nwrong color. I don’t need this aggravation. I give up teaching.\nYou win. Go hire all the blacks and foreigners to balance the\nemployment. I am not going to endanger my life anymore.”\nFrom August 1999 through June 2002, Koszola again applied\nunsuccessfully for CPS teaching positions in schools on the\nNorth and Northwest Sides.\n  Since 1980, the Board’s faculty hiring and assignment\nprocess for the CPS has been governed by a federal consent\ndecree arising from a lawsuit brought by the Department of\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                 3\n\nJustice alleging that the Board maintained a racially\nsegregated school system in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause. The decree provides for “the establishment of the\ngreatest practicable number of stably desegregated schools,\nconsidering all the circumstances in Chicago,” and, to that\nend, calls for integration of both the student bodies and\nfaculty of the CPS. With respect to faculty assignments, the\ndecree requires that “[t]he Board will promptly implement\na plan to assure that the assignment of full-time classroom\nteachers to schools will be made in such a manner that no\nschool is identified as intended for students of a particular\nrace.” The decree dictates that “with respect to the full-time\nclassroom teachers in each school faculty, the racial/ethnic\ncomposition and the proportion of experienced teachers will\nbe plus and minus fifteen percent of the systemwide\nproportions of such teachers with respect to such character-\nistics, and the range of educational training will be substan-\ntially the same as exists in the system as a whole.”\n  On April 17, 2001, Koszola filed a complaint against the\nBoard in federal district court alleging racial discrimination\nin violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., and the Equal Protection Clause.\nSpecifically, she alleged that her applications for full-time\nemployment with the CPS had “continually been rejected or\nnot considered by Defendant because she is Caucasian.”\nAfter discovery closed, the Board successfully moved for\nsummary judgment. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                             II\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it\n“shall be an unlawful employment practice for an em-\nployer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\nindividual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such individ-\n\f4                                                 No. 03-2428\n\nual’s race . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). To prevail on her\nrace discrimination claim, Koszola must either show direct\nevidence of discriminatory motive or intent or rely on the\nindirect burden-shifting method outlined in McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). The district\ncourt found that Koszola could not prevail under either\napproach. We review a district court’s decision to grant\nsummary judgment de novo. McDonald v. Vill. of Winnetka,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786571\"><a href=\"/opinion/786571/charles-m-mcdonald-v-village-of-winnetka-ronald-colpaert-scott-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001 (7th Cir. 2004). In doing so, we construe\nall facts and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts\nin favor of the non-moving party. Id.\n  In reviewing Koszola’s Title VII claim, the district court\nconsidered only those facts included in the parties’ Local\nRule 56.1 statements of material fact, a decision that\nKoszola challenges on appeal. Under the Local Rules of the\nNorthern District of Illinois, a party filing a motion for sum-\nmary judgment under FED. R. CIV. P. 56 must serve and file\n“a statement of material facts as to which the moving party\ncontends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the\nmoving party to a judgment as a matter of law.” N.D. Ill.\nLocal R. 56.1(a)(3). Further, Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(A)\nrequires that the non-moving party file a reply, including “a\nresponse to each numbered paragraph in the moving party’s\nstatement, including, in the case of any disagreement, specific\nreferences to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other\nsupporting materials relied upon.” The reply must also\ninclude “any additional facts that require the denial of sum-\nmary judgment,” with appropriate references to the record.\nId. at 56.1(b)(3)(B). Finally, Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) pro-\nvides that “[a]ll material facts set forth in the statement\nrequired of the moving party will be deemed to be admitted\nunless controverted by the statement of the opposing party.”\nThis court reviews the decision of a district court concerning\ncompliance with local rules, such as Rule 56.1, only for an\nabuse of discretion. Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786237\"><a href=\"/opinion/786237/clyde-ammons-v-aramark-uniform-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (7th Cir. 2004).\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                  5\n\n   To establish the set of facts that were properly before the\ndistrict court, a brief review of the procedural history of the\ncase is in order. On July 11, 2002, the Board filed its Local\nRule 56.1(a) Statement of Facts, listing 54 paragraphs of\nallegedly undisputed facts. Among these was Paragraph 29,\nwhich stated: “Koszola does not know the name, qualifi-\ncations, date of assignment, or otherwise have any personal\nknowledge regarding any persons who were assigned to full-\ntime positions which she sought with the Chicago Public\nSchools.” On September 20, 2002, Koszola filed her Local\nRule 56.1(b) response, in which she admitted that she “[did]\nnot dispute these facts” in paragraphs 1-54 of the Board’s\nfiling. She then provided additional statements of fact,\nincluding Paragraph 57, which stated: “With respect to\nDefendant’s 29, Plaintiff identifies the persons who were\nhired in her place at Oriole Park by a black female from\nTexas, Hitch by a black female from Georgia, Canty by an\nHispanic male teacher, Sayre Academy by a black female by\nthe name of Ms. Smith.” At the Board’s motion, the court\nstruck a number of paragraphs from Koszola’s response and\naccompanying affidavit, including Paragraph 57 on the\nground that it “inherently contradicts facts in the Board’s\nstatement” that Koszola had admitted. In particular, her\nidentification in Paragraph 57 of specific schools that had\nallegedly hired nonwhite teachers and the races of those\nhired contradicted her admission of the Board’s Paragraph\n29. The court then granted Koszola five days to resubmit\nher Local Rule 56.1(b) statement and supporting affidavit.\n  On November 20, 2002, Koszola submitted a revised Local\nRule 56.1(b) statement and affidavit, which omitted the\nparagraphs stricken by the district court. Inexplicably,\nKoszola again admitted all the factual statements in the\nBoard’s original Local Rule 56.1(a) statement, including\nParagraph 29. In addition, she replaced the text of Paragraph\n57 in her response with the following: “In the fall of 1996 at\na public school Plaintiff was substituting regularily (sic) the\n\f6                                                No. 03-2428\n\nprincipal apologized to plaintiff for never interviewing\nplaintiff. She explained that she was forced to hire a mi-\nnority and she told Plaintiff that Plaintiff was eight times\nbetter than the candidate she had. The principle (sic) nodded\nto a young black female, identifying her as the one she\nhired for the position.” Koszola also attached an affidavit\nrecounting several instances in which principals at certain\nChicago public schools indicated that they would consider\nonly minority candidates, but she did not include this\ninformation in her Rule 56.1(b) response.\n   In granting the Board’s motion for summary judgment,\nthe court explained that it had considered only the facts in\nthe parties’ Local Rule 56.1 Statements of Material Facts,\nas it was entitled to do.

Reform\nBd. of Trs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771246\"><a href=\"/opinion/771246/lionel-bordelon-v-chicago-school-reform-board-of-trustees/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (7th Cir. 2000). Therefore,\nKoszola’s only evidence of discrimination that the court\nconsidered was Paragraph 57 of her November response,\nwhich recounted an unidentified principal’s comment that\nshe was “force[d] to hire a minority.” On appeal, Koszola ar-\ngues that the court should also have considered Paragraph 57\nof her September response, which listed specific schools that\nhad hired nonwhite teachers and the races of these hires.\nWe find no error in the court’s exclusion of this latter\nparagraph because, as the district court indicated, it\n“inherently contradict[ed] facts in the Board’s statement,”\nthe entirety of which Koszola had admitted.

As the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in limiting its review of Koszola’s Local Rule\n56.1 statements and her supplemental materials, our de\nnovo review of its grant of summary judgment will likewise\nrest only on the Board’s Local Rule 56.1(a) statement and\nKoszola’s November Local Rule 56.1(b) response.\n  On this record, Koszola has failed to carry her burden with\nrespect to her Title VII claim. Under the direct method of\nproving discrimination, Koszola had to show either through\ndirect or circumstantial evidence that the Board’s decision\nto not to hire her was motivated by an impermissible pur-\npose, such as her race.

The district court refused to\nconsider this statement on the ground that it “lacks proper\nevidentiary foundation.” The basis for this conclusion is not\nentirely clear, as we would expect this statement to be\nadmissible under FED. R. EVID. 801(d)(2)(D) as the admis-\nsion of a party-opponent, that is, “a statement by the party’s\nagent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of\nthe agency or employment, made during the existence of the\nrelationship.” Yet even if Paragraph 57 is properly before\nus, it is not sufficient to permit Koszola to recover under the\ndirect method. Koszola filed her Local Rule 56.1 statement\nafter the close of discovery, yet the only evidence of discrim-\nination included in her statement consisted of this assertion\nthat an unidentified principal at a unidentified Chicago\npublic school told her that she was “eight times better” than\nan unidentified African-American hire. There is no evidence\nin the record showing that Koszola ever attempted to depose\nthis principal, to identify the teacher hired, or to establish\nthe teacher’s qualifications. Furthermore, this statement is\ninconsistent with Koszola’s admission that she “does not\nknow the name, qualifications, date of assignment, or\notherwise have any personal knowledge regarding any\npersons who were assigned to full-time positions which she\nsought with the Chicago Public Schools.”\n  For this same reason, Koszola cannot prevail under the\nindirect burden-shifting method outlined in McDonnell\n\fNo. 03-2428                                                    9\n\nDouglas. Under this approach, a plaintiff must present evi-\ndence tending to show: (1) she was a member of a protected\nclass; (2) she applied for, and was qualified for, an open\nposition; (3) the employer rejected her for the position; and\n(4) the employer filled the position with an individual out-\nside of the plaintiff’s protected class, or the position remained\nvacant.

Id. at 694-95. As the Board\nhas conceded that Koszola has satisfied the first three\nelements of McDonnell Douglas, we need only consider the\nlast part. In Greer v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of Chi., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775156\"><a href=\"/opinion/775156/tyrone-j-greer-v-board-of-education-of-the-city-of-chicago-illinois-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2001), we indicated that the showing re-\nquired under the fourth element of McDonnell Douglas must\ntake the federal consent decree into account, and that a\nplaintiff would have “to show, at minimum, that the Board\nallowed teachers of another race to work at schools even if\ntheir presence would have contributed to a racial imbalance\namong that school’s faculty.” Id. at 728.\n  We need not decide here exactly how the consent decree\nmight affect Koszola’s case, because she presented no evi-\ndence that might have shown a violation of the decree’s\nguidelines. In her Local Rule 56.1(b) statement, Koszola ad-\nmitted that she can identify only five schools by name “at\nwhich she was told that an African-American or Hispanic\nteacher was hired for a full-time position at or near the\ntimes she sought a full-time position at the individual school.”\nShe further admitted that five of these schools were not\nwithin the +/- 15% compliance guidelines during the rele-\nvant time period, with nonwhite faculty underrepresented\nat all five schools. In addition, she admitted that she “does\nnot know the name of any of the five minority teachers that\nshe was told were hired [at these schools], nor does she\nknow anything about their teaching skills and qualifica-\n\f10                                                 No. 03-2428\n\ntions.” Koszola also identified a sixth school at which an\nAsian-American was allegedly hired for a position in which\nKoszola had expressed interest, but she produced no evidence\nshowing that this hire contributed to a racial imbalance in\nthe school’s faculty. Moreover, in her Local Rule 56.1(b)\nresponse, she admitted that the principal at the school “did\nnot hire Koszola for a full-time position because, based on\nher performance as a student teacher, he perceived that she\nlacked the skills necessary to be an effective teacher . . . [and\nhad] deficient classroom management and lesson-planning\nskills.” In the absence of evidence that “the Board allowed\nteachers of another race to work at schools even if their\npresence would have contributed to a racial imbalance\namong that school’s faculty,” Koszola could not make out a\nprima facie case under McDonnell Douglas assuming that\nthe consent decree informs the inquiry. See Greer, 267 F.3d\nat 728.\n  Treating this as a straightforward Title VII case, Koszola\nalso loses. She has not identified a nonwhite comparator\nwho was hired by the schools to which she applied and who\nis similarly situated to her in all material respects. With\nrespect to the five nonwhite hires, Koszola has conceded\nthat she does not “know anything about their teaching skills\nand qualifications.” Likewise, Koszola has admitted that she\ndoes not “know the name, qualifications, date of assignment,\nor otherwise have any personal knowledge regarding any\npersons who were assigned to full-time positions which she\nsought with the Chicago Public Schools.” There is no evi-\ndence in the record showing that Koszola attempted to\nobtain this information from the Board or other sources. As\nwe have often stated, summary judgment “is the ‘put up or\nshut up’ moment in a lawsuit, when a party must show\nwhat evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to\naccept its version of events.” Johnson v.

Koszola has thus failed to establish a\ngenuine issue of material fact on the question whether the\nBoard discriminated against her.\n\n\n                             III\n  For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n\nA true Copy:\n       Teste:\n\n                         ________________________________\n                         Clerk of the United States Court of\n                           Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                    USCA-02-C-0072—10-8-04\n\f</pre>",
