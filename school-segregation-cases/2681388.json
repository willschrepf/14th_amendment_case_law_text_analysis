DAVIS\n\n                          OPINION\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Jesse James Andrews appeals from the district court’s\ndenial of all but one of the claims raised in his petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The state\ncross-appeals the district court’s grant of relief on Andrews’s\nclaim that his counsel’s assistance was ineffective at the\npenalty phase of his capital murder trial. We dismiss as\nunripe the claim the district court certified for appeal, and\ndeny Andrews’s motion to expand the certificate of\nappealability to include uncertified claims. We reverse its\ngrant of relief on the ineffective assistance claim because,\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the California Supreme Court\ndid not unreasonably apply Supreme Court precedent in\nconcluding that Andrews was not prejudiced by any deficient\nperformance by his counsel.\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    On December 9, 1979, police were called to a Los\nAngeles apartment, where they found the bodies of three\nmurder victims. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d 285, 288 (Cal.\n1989). The murder victims were Preston Wheeler, who lived\nin the apartment, Patrice Brandon, and Ronald Chism. Id.\nThe California Supreme Court described the murder scene as\nfollows:\n\n       Wheeler had been stabbed in the chest six\n       times and shot in the neck at close range with\n       either a .32– or .357– caliber weapon. His\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       5\n\n       face and head were bruised, and his face had\n       been slashed with a knife. Brandon and\n       Chism had been strangled with wire coat\n       hangers. Their faces were bruised, Chism’s\n       extensively. Brandon’s anus was extremely\n       dilated, bruised, reddened and torn, consistent\n       with the insertion of a penis shortly before her\n       death. There was also redness around the\n       opening of her vagina, and vaginal samples\n       revealed the presence of semen and\n       spermatozoa. All three victims were bound\n       hand and foot.\n\nId.\n\n    Approximately a year later, police arrested Charles\nSanders in connection with the murders. Id. Sanders entered\ninto a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to three\ncounts of second degree murder, admitted a gun\nenhancement, and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution,\nin exchange for a sentence of 17 years to life in prison. Id.\nDuring his interrogation by the police, Sanders gave both a\ntape-recorded and a written statement. Id. He also testified\nat Andrews’s trial, and described the crime as follows:\n\n       Sanders testified that he and [Andrews]\n       devised a plan to rob Wheeler, a drug dealer.\n       [Andrews] armed himself with a .357\n       magnum and gave Sanders a .38–or\n       .32–caliber automatic. On the evening of the\n       murders, they visited their friend, Carol\n       Brooks, who lived in the same apartment\n       building as Wheeler, and then went to\n       Wheeler’s apartment. In response to their\n\f6                ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    knocking, Wheeler, who apparently knew\n    [Andrews], let them in. Also inside the\n    apartment was a woman (Patrice Brandon).\n    After smoking some marijuana with Wheeler,\n    [Andrews] and Sanders drew their guns.\n    Sanders tied Wheeler and Brandon with belts\n    and socks, put on a pair of gloves, and began\n    to search the apartment for drugs and money.\n    Except for some powder on a saucer which\n    appeared to be cocaine, the search was\n    unsuccessful. [Andrews] questioned Wheeler,\n    who denied having any drugs or money.\n    Saying he would make Brandon talk,\n    [Andrews] dragged her into the kitchen and\n    closed the door. Sanders remained in the\n    living room with Wheeler.\n\n    Sanders heard [Andrews] hitting Brandon and\n    later heard sounds as though they were having\n    sex. When [Andrews] came out of the kitchen\n    shortly thereafter, Sanders saw Brandon’s\n    pants around her ankles.\n\n    [Andrews] put his gun in Wheeler’s mouth.\n    He threatened to kill Wheeler and Brandon\n    unless Wheeler revealed the location of the\n    drugs. Wheeler said the ‘dope’ was in the\n    attic, and pointed out a trap door leading up to\n    it. Sanders climbed into the attic. While in\n    the attic, Sanders heard two shots. When he\n    came down, [Andrews] told him he had shot\n    Wheeler because the latter had tried to jump\n    out the window. Sanders asked if Wheeler\n    was dead. [Andrews] responded he was\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        7\n\n       ‘standing right up’ on Wheeler when he fired\n       the gun . . . . When Sanders asked about\n       Brandon, [Andrews] replied he had killed her\n       before leaving the kitchen.\n\n       While [Andrews] and Sanders were cleaning\n       up the apartment, Ronald Chism knocked on\n       the door and asked if everything was all right.\n       [Andrews] said Wheeler was home and\n       invited him inside. [Andrews] then hit Chism\n       on the head, tied him up, and took him into\n       the bathroom. Sanders saw [Andrews] sitting\n       astride Chism’s back, joining and separating\n       his clenched fists in a tugging motion,\n       apparently strangling Chism. Sanders then\n       saw [Andrews] go into the kitchen and choke\n       Brandon with a wire clothes hanger. When\n       the two left the apartment, [Andrews] gave\n       Sanders some money, saying it was all he had\n       found.\n\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d 656, 658 (Cal. 2002) (alterations,\ncitations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nwas eventually arrested, and he was charged in June 1982.\n\n    At trial, the jury heard Sanders’s testimony as well as the\ntestimony of Carol Brooks. Brooks confirmed that Andrews\nand Sanders visited her on the night of the murders and told\nher about their plan to “get some money” from Wheeler.\nPeople v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at 289. A week after the\nincident, Sanders told her about his involvement in the\nmurders. Id. Then, a few weeks later, Andrews confessed to\nher that he shot Wheeler, had sex with Brandon, and took\n$300 during the robbery. Id.\n\f8                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    The prosecution also presented fingerprint evidence. Id.\nPolice experts analyzed 50 prints lifted from the apartment;\nthree prints belonged to Andrews. Id. One fingerprint was\nfound on a coffee table in Wheeler’s living room. Id. Two\npalm prints were found on the kitchen floor, on either side of\nthe spot where Brandon’s body was found, the left palm print\nbeing about a foot from her body.\n\n    The defense primarily focused on undermining Sanders’s\ncredibility. Id. Two jail inmates who had been incarcerated\nwith Sanders testified. Id. They stated that, while Sanders\nwas incarcerated with them, he made statements suggesting\nhe planned to lie about the murders to shift blame onto\nAndrews and away from himself. Id.\n\n    The jury deliberated for three days before finding\nAndrews guilty of murder.1 The jury also found three special\ncircumstances to be true. Two special circumstances related\nto the offense conduct: (1) multiple murder and robbery\nmurder, based on the murders of Wheeler, Brandon, and\nChism, and the robbery of Wheeler, and 2) rape-murder,\nbased on the rape and murder of Brandon. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 659. The third special circumstance was\nAndrews’s conviction for murder of a grocery store clerk in\n1967. Id.\n\n    Both the prosecutor and defense counsel made brief\npresentations at the penalty phase. The prosecutor presented\nevidence through a joint stipulation. Id. He noted that the\njury had already found that Andrews had been convicted of\nmurder in 1967. The parties also stipulated that Andrews had\n\n  1\n    Andrews was convicted after his second trial, because the jury failed\nto reach a verdict in the first trial.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        9\n\nbeen convicted of armed robbery in May 1968, that he had\nbeen convicted of escape in November 1969, and that he had\nbeen convicted of robbery in June 1977. Id. The stipulation\ndid not describe the facts of the offenses underlying these\nadditional convictions. The prosecution also submitted\nphotographs of the dead bodies of Patrice Brandon and\nRonald Chism as they were found by the police in the\napartment; the photos had been excluded at the guilt phase on\nthe ground they were unduly inflammatory. Id. Finally, the\nparties stipulated that Andrews’s birth date was July 2, 1950.\nId.\n\n    The defense evidence consisted of two sworn statements\nthat were read to the jury. Id. The statements described facts\nunderlying the incident in September 1966 that formed the\nbasis of Andrews’s 1967 conviction for murder. According\nto the statements, Andrews and a 17-year-old companion,\nboth of whom were armed, attempted to rob a grocery store,\nand the companion fired three shots, killing the grocery store\nclerk. Id.\n\n    In his closing argument, defense counsel focused on\nmitigating circumstances. He argued that Andrews’s crimes\nwere unsophisticated, occurred several years apart, and all\ninvolved the unexpected escalation of a planned robbery. Id.\nHe pointed out that Andrews was only 15 years old at the\ntime of the murder of the grocery store clerk, and was not the\nshooter. Id. He portrayed Andrews’s conduct as less\nblameworthy because the murders occurred while Andrews,\nSanders, Wheeler, and Brandon were under the influence of\nillegal drugs. Id. at 659–60. Finally, he emphasized that\nother murderers had received life without the possibility of\nparole despite the jury’s finding of special circumstances, and\ndespite more blameworthy conduct. Id. at 659. He pointed\n\f10                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nout that in this very case, Sanders received a sentence of only\n17 years to life. Id. at 660. The prosecution made no\nrebuttal.\n\n    After one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict\nimposing the death penalty for each of the three murder\ncounts. The court sentenced Andrews to death on the three\ncounts on June 8, 1984. The California Supreme Court\naffirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal on\nAugust 3, 1989. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at 285, 288.\n\n                              B\n\n    Andrews filed petitions for state post-conviction relief,\nclaiming, among other things, that his counsel’s assistance\nwas ineffective at the penalty phase because counsel did not\nadequately investigate and present mitigating evidence. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denied all of Andrews’s\nclaims, except for his penalty phase ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.\n\n    The California Supreme Court appointed a referee to take\nevidence and make factual findings on six questions related\nto Andrews’s penalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659. Two of the six\nquestions are relevant to the question of whether Andrews\nwas prejudiced by his counsel’s allegedly ineffective\nassistance: “1. What mitigating character and background\nevidence could have been, but was not, presented by\n[Andrews]’s trial attorneys at his penalty trial?” id. at 660,\nand “5. What evidence, damaging to [Andrews], but not\npresented by the prosecution at the guilt or penalty trials,\nwould likely have been presented in rebuttal, if [Andrews]\nhad introduced any such mitigating character and background\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              11\n\nevidence?” id. at 664.2 The referee received the testimony of\nover 50 witnesses, which took place over the span of six\nyears, id. at 660, and issued a lengthy written report of her\nfindings.\n\n    The California Supreme Court denied Andrews’s penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a lengthy\nopinion. Id. at 656–76. In its opinion, the court summarized\nthe referee’s findings. In response to the first question, the\nreferee identified three broad categories of mitigating\nevidence that were available but not presented to the jury:\nAndrews’s family background; the conditions of his\nconfinement in a juvenile reform school and in the Alabama\nprison system; and his mental health. Id. at 660. As\nsummarized in the court’s opinion, the referee’s report\nincluded the following information regarding Andrews’s\n\n 2\n     The other four questions were:\n\n          2. What investigative steps by trial counsel, if any,\n          would have led to each such item of information?\n\n          3. What investigative steps, if any, did trial counsel take\n          in an effort to gather mitigating evidence to be\n          presented at the penalty phase?\n\n          4. What tactical or financial constraints, if any, weighed\n          against the investigation or presentation of mitigating\n          character and background evidence at the penalty\n          phase? . . .\n\n          6. Did [Andrews] himself request that either the\n          investigation or the presentation of mitigating evidence\n          at the penalty phase be curtailed in any manner? If so,\n          what specifically did [Andrews] request?\n\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659.\n\f12                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nbackground. When he was very young, Andrews’s alcoholic\nparents separated, and his mother left him to be raised by his\ngrandparents and aunt, in a large family home with his\nsiblings and cousins, located in a poor, segregated\nneighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. Id. The referee described\nAndrews’s grandfather as “loving, benevolent, and\nresponsible,” id., and the court added that Andrews’s mother\nregularly sent money and clothing to her children and that\nAndrews’s upbringing and early family life were “relatively\nstable and without serious privation or abuse,” id. at 670.\nWhen Andrews was around nine or ten, his mother returned\nhome to stay. Id. at 660, 670. She had children by another\nmarriage, of whom Andrews was jealous. Id. at 660. Around\nthat time Andrews’s grandfather, a “pivotal figure” in his life,\ndied. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nbecame withdrawn, skipped school, and at age 14, committed\ncar theft and was sent to a reform school known as Mt.\nMeigs, formally the Alabama Industrial School for Negro\nChildren. Id.\n\n    The conditions at Mt. Meigs, described succinctly by the\nstate court as “appalling,” included “beatings, brutality,\ninadequate conditions and sexual predators.” Id. at 660–61\n(internal quotation marks omitted). According to the\nreferee’s report, one witness described it as “a farming\noperation and a penal colony for children,” while others\ndescribed “inhuman conditions, inadequate food and clothing\nand severe beatings,” with “sticks, broom handles, tree limbs,\nand hoe handles . . . or fan belts.” Andrews was released at\nage 16. Id. at 661.\n\n   Within three months of his release, in September 1966, he\nand a companion were involved in the attempted robbery and\nmurder of the grocery store clerk that became one of the three\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       13\n\nspecial circumstances in this capital case. See supra at 9; In\nre Andrews, 52 P.3d at 661. The evidence showed that when\nAndrews and his companion were fleeing the scene in a taxi,\nthey robbed the taxi driver at gunpoint. In re Andrews, 52\nP.3d at 661. The taxi driver testified he heard Andrews say\n“[l]et’s shoot him.” Id. at 665 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Andrews then fired at least two shots at the taxi\ndriver. Id. In 1967, Andrews was convicted of murder based\non the grocery store incident, and in 1968, he was convicted\nof armed robbery of the taxi driver. Id. at 661 n.4. Just\nbefore he turned 18, he was committed to Alabama state\nprison. Id. at 661.\n\n    Summarizing the referee’s findings about conditions in\nthe four different prisons in which Andrews was confined\nover ten years, the California Supreme Court stated:\n\n       [The referee] described conditions in these\n       institutions as abysmal, characterized by\n       severe overcrowding, racial segregation,\n       substandard facilities, no separation of the\n       tougher inmates from younger or smaller\n       inmates, constant violence, the persistent\n       threat of sexual assaults and the constant\n       presence of sexual pressure, the availability\n       and necessity of weapons by all inmates, and\n       degrading conditions in disciplinary modules.\n       [Andrews] not only received beatings but was\n       also personally subjected to sexual assaults.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    The court also noted that Andrews had been involved in\nprison violence, including “the stabbings of two inmates who\n\f14                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nhad been threatening him.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). However, Andrews “was rarely the instigator of\nviolence,” was “the prey rather than the predator” when he\nwas involved, and was often a target of violence due to his\nsmall stature. Id. at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHe also “appeared to adjust well when the structure permitted\nand . . . would continue to do so” and, “when circumstances\npermitted, he tended to hold positions of responsibility.” Id.\n\n    After his release from prison in 1976, Andrews engaged\nin an attempted robbery of a laundry. Id. at 661. In this\nincident:\n\n       Mobile Police Officer Pettis testified that on\n       March 23, 1977, he responded to a robbery\n       call. Entering the store from which the call\n       came, he and other officers saw [Andrews]\n       holding a crying young woman hostage with\n       a cocked gun at her head. He told the officers\n       to leave and “continued to repeat, ‘Someone’s\n       going to get shot, I’m going to shoot.’” The\n       officers withdrew. Ultimately, [Andrews]\n       surrendered to the officers after releasing the\n       young woman and another woman whom he\n       had also held hostage.\n\nId. at 665. Andrews was arrested for the robbery, but escaped\nfrom jail and fled to California. Id. at 661.\n\n    In California, Andrews met Debra Pickett, with whom he\nhad a stable relationship. Id. The couple had a child, and\nAndrews held a job during this time. Id. But Andrews\nresumed using cocaine, left his job and family, and then\ncommitted the three murders at issue here. Id.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             15\n\n    The referee also described the testimony from mental\nhealth experts that could have been presented at the penalty\nphase. Summarizing the referee’s report, the California\nSupreme Court noted that the experts diagnosed Andrews\nwith a range of mental disorders, including attention deficit\ndisorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and mild to\nmoderate organic brain impairment, in part due to drug use\nand possibly due to a head injury in prison. Id. The experts\nopined that Andrews’s learning disability, the adverse\ncircumstances of his childhood, the impact of the correctional\nsystems, and the PTSD made his commission of the murders\nand sexual assault more understandable and less morally\nculpable. Id. at 661–62. The experts gave specific examples\nof how Andrews’s impairments and the brutal conditions of\nincarceration made it difficult for him to avoid getting into\ntrouble with the law. Id. at 661–62, 670. For example, one\npsychiatrist testified that one of the victims had hurled an\ninsulting slur at Andrews a few days before the murders, and\nAndrews’s PTSD would predispose him to overreact to the\nslur, which contributed to the expert’s conclusion that\nAndrews was “under the influence of extreme mental or\nemotional distress” when he committed the murders.\n\n    In addressing the question whether the prosecutor would\nhave introduced evidence damaging to Andrews in rebuttal,\nthe referee found that the prosecution’s rebuttal presentation\ncould have included evidence about two of Andrews’s prior\nconvictions.3 Id. at 664–65. First, during the penalty phase\n\n\n\n 3\n   Andrews argued that the prosecutor testified he would not have put on\nadditional evidence, but the California Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, finding that presentation of the mitigating evidence would have\nprompted the prosecutor to shift the focus of his penalty phase case, put\n\f16                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nof Andrews’s trial, the jury was reminded of its special\ncircumstance finding, that Andrews had been convicted of\nmurder in 1967 for his involvement in the grocery store\nrobbery-murder in 1966. It also heard that Andrews was\nconvicted of robbery in 1968, but it did not hear the facts on\nwhich the conviction was based, such as evidence that\nAndrews shot at the driver of the get-away taxi, which could\nhave been introduced as aggravating evidence. Id. at 659,\n664. The prosecution could have introduced that evidence to\nshow Andrews’s greater moral culpability for the incident.\nId. at 664. Second, the prosecution could have informed the\njury about Andrews’s attempt to rob a laundry business\nfollowing his release from prison in 1976, which involved\nholding two women hostage, one with a gun to her head. Id.\nat 661, 665.\n\n    Further, the referee determined that the prosecution could\nhave called its own mental health experts to rebut Andrews’s\nevidence. Id. at 665. The state could have presented expert\ntestimony that Andrews did not suffer from PTSD, but rather\nsuffered from antisocial personality disorder, resented\nauthority, and had a normal-range IQ of 93. Id. A second\nexpert would have testified that Andrews’s ability to hold a\njob and maintain a stable relationship with Debra Pickett\nbefore he committed the murders indicated he did not suffer\nfrom brain damage, and the planning and thought that went\ninto the murders made it unlikely that he was under the\ninfluence of drugs at the time. Id.\n\n    After recounting the referee’s findings on these questions\nas well as the other four questions, and resolving objections\n\n\non additional witnesses, and use cross-examination and closing argument\nto further damage Andrews’s mitigation case. Id. at 665–66.\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       17\n\nto the referee’s report, the California Supreme Court turned\nto its analysis of Andrews’s ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim. Id. at 667. It held that Andrews’s counsel’s\nperformance was not deficient during the penalty phase of the\ntrial because Andrews’s counsel made a reasonable\ninvestigation, under then-existing professional norms and\nSupreme Court precedent, and counsel also made a\nreasonable decision not to conduct additional investigation.\nId. 667–71. It then held that even if counsel’s performance\nwere deficient, Andrews suffered no prejudice because a\ndifferent result was not reasonably probable in light of the\nseverity of his crimes, the fact that the jury might view some\nof his mitigating evidence as aggravating, and the substantial\nrebuttal evidence that could have been presented. Id. at 671.\n\n    Andrews filed a habeas petition in federal district court.\nHis amended petition raised 32 claims, including multiple\nsubclaims. In a lengthy ruling on the merits of the petition,\nthe district court denied 31 claims, but granted relief on the\nclaim that Andrews’s counsel were ineffective at the penalty\nphase of his trial for failing to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence. Reviewing the evidence\nproduced by the referee on this issue, the district court\nconcluded that counsel had made “essentially no effort to\ninvestigate and put on evidence in mitigation,” which\nconstituted deficient performance under Strickland. The\ncourt then ruled that counsel’s “failure to adequately\ninvestigate and discover evidence of a life filled with abuse\nand privation is sufficient to establish prejudice under\nStrickland,” but the court did not consider whether the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s rejection of this ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim was “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of” Strickland under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1). The court granted Andrews’s petition on this\n\f18                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, denied Andrews’s\nother 31 claims, and granted a certificate of appealability\n(COA) on Andrews’s claim that California’s lethal injection\nprotocol violates the Eighth Amendment (Claim 25).\n\n    Andrews timely appealed, challenging the district court’s\ndenial of Claim 25 and the denials of several uncertified\nclaims. The state cross-appealed the district court’s grant of\nrelief on Andrews’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nAfter briefing on his appeal was complete, Andrews moved\nfor permission to brief an additional uncertified claim, in\nwhich he seeks habeas relief on the ground that it would\nviolate the Eighth Amendment to execute him after a long\ndelay from the date of his sentencing. We granted the\nmotion.\n\n                              II\n\n    We review a district court’s grant or denial of habeas\nrelief de novo. Moses v. Payne, 555 F.3d 742, 750 (9th Cir.\n2009).\n\n                              A\n\n    The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n(AEDPA) applies to Andrews’s federal habeas petition,\nwhich was filed after April 24, 1996. See Lindh v. Murphy,\n521 U.S. 320, 322, 336 (1997). Under AEDPA, a court may\nnot grant a habeas petition “with respect to any claim that was\nadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,”\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), unless the state court’s judgment\n“resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,”\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              19\n\n§ 2254(d)(1), or “was based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\nin the State court proceeding,” § 2254(d)(2).4\n\n    Under § 2254(d)(1), the relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent includes only the decisions in existence “as of the\ntime the state court renders its decision.” Greene v. Fisher,\n132 S. Ct. 38, 44 (2011) (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted); see also Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct.\n1388, 1399 (2011) (“State-court decisions are measured\nagainst [the Supreme] Court’s precedents as of the time the\nstate court renders its decision.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Thus, Supreme Court cases decided after the state\ncourt’s decision are not clearly established precedent under\n§ 2254(d)(1) for purposes of evaluating whether the state\ncourt reasonably applied such precedent.\n\n    A Supreme Court precedent is not clearly established law\nunder § 2254(d)(1) unless it “squarely addresses the issue” in\nthe case before the state court, Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S.\n120, 125–26 (2008) (per curiam), or “establish[es] a legal\nprinciple that ‘clearly extends’” to the case before the state\ncourt, Moses, 555 F.3d at 754 (alterations omitted) (quoting\nVan Patten, 552 U.S. at 123); see also Carey v. Musladin,\n549 U.S. 70, 76–77 (2006) (holding that Supreme Court cases\nevaluating state-sponsored courtroom conduct were not\nclearly established law governing private actor courtroom\nconduct). “[W]hen a state court may draw a principled\n\n\n 4\n   Neither party disputes that the claims in this case were “adjudicated on\nthe merits” by the California Supreme Court, and that its decision\nconstitutes the “last reasoned decision” of the state court with respect to\nthose claims. See Cheney v. Washington, 614 F.3d 987, 993, 995 (9th Cir.\n2010).\n\f20                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndistinction between the case before it and Supreme Court\ncaselaw, the law is not clearly established for the state-court\ncase.” Murdoch v. Castro, 609 F.3d 983, 991 (9th Cir. 2010).\n“[I]f a habeas court must extend a rationale before it can\napply to the facts at hand, then by definition the rationale was\nnot clearly established at the time of the state-court decision.”\nWhite v. Woodall, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 1706 (2014) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A principle is clearly established\nlaw governing the case “if, and only if, it is so obvious that a\nclearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that\nthere could be no fairminded disagreement on the question.”\nId. at 1706–07 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    A state court decision is “contrary to” Supreme Court\nprecedent if “the state court applies a rule that contradicts the\ngoverning law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases.” Williams\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405 (2000). An “unreasonable\napplication” of Supreme Court precedent is not one that is\nmerely “incorrect or erroneous,” Lockyer v. Andrade,\n538 U.S. 63, 75 (2003); see also Williams, 529 U.S. at 410;\nrather, “[t]he pivotal question is whether the state court’s\napplication of the [relevant Supreme Court precedent] was\nunreasonable,” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101\n(2011) (emphasis added). If “‘fairminded jurists could\ndisagree’ on the correctness of the state court’s decision,” that\ndecision is not unreasonable. Id. at 101 (quoting Yarborough\nv. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)). A state court\nsummary denial is an “unreasonable application” of Supreme\nCourt precedent only if “there was no reasonable basis,” id.\nat 98, for the decision in light of the “arguments or theories\n[that] . . . could have supported[] the state court’s decision,”\nid. at 102.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        21\n\n    The Supreme Court has made clear that § 2254(d) sets\nforth a “highly deferential standard[,] . . . which demands that\nstate-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.”\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “As amended by AEDPA, § 2254(d) stops short of\nimposing a complete bar on federal-court relitigation of\nclaims already rejected in state proceedings,” but only\n“preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there is\nno possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state\ncourt’s decision conflicts with this Court’s precedents” and\n“goes no further.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 102. “[E]ven a strong\ncase for relief does not mean the state court’s contrary\nconclusion was unreasonable.” Id. In a nutshell, “[i]f this\nstandard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to\nbe.” Id. at 102.\n\n                               B\n\n     The clearly established federal law for ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt, is Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and\nits progeny. See Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1403. Strickland\nconcluded that, under the Sixth Amendment, the accused has\nthe right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial and\nduring capital sentencing proceedings. 466 U.S. at 684–87.\nA petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must\nprove: (1) that “counsel’s performance was deficient,” and\n(2) that “the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.”\nId. at 687. “[A] court need not determine whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient before examining the prejudice\nsuffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged\ndeficiencies.” Id. at 697. Rather, “[i]f it is easier to dispose\nof an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient\nprejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course\n\f22                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nshould be followed.” Id. In short, a court need not address\nthe two Strickland prongs in order; if ruling on the prejudice\nprong more efficiently resolves the case, reaching the\ndeficiency prong is unnecessary. Id.\n\n    In determining whether a state court’s adjudication of an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent, we may consider\nhow the Supreme Court itself has applied Strickland to other\nfactual contexts, but this is merely “illustrative of the proper\napplication of [Strickland’s] standards.” See Wiggins v.\nSmith, 539 U.S. 510, 522 (2003); see also Pinholster, 131 S.\nCt. at 1407 n.17; Brian R. Means, Federal Habeas Manual\n§ 3:29 (2014). The Supreme Court has warned us not to\nderive “strict rules” from its cases applying Strickland de\nnovo because “the Strickland test ‘of necessity requires a\ncase-by-case examination of the evidence.’” Pinholster, 131\nS.Ct. at 1407 & n.17 (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 391).\nFurther, Supreme Court cases decided on de novo review\n“offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has\nunreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking” or defense\ncounsel was deficient, and so are not directly applicable to a\nfederal court’s review under § 2254(d)(1) of a habeas\npetitioner’s claim that a state court unreasonably applied\nStrickland. Id. at 1411. Indeed, a state court’s application of\nStrickland may be objectively reasonable based on clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent at the time of its\ndecision even if the Supreme Court’s subsequent applications\nof Strickland suggest a different result. By contrast, when the\nSupreme Court addresses the AEDPA question whether a\nstate court’s adjudication of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland,\nits reasoning guides a federal court’s AEDPA analysis\nregardless of when the opinion was issued.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       23\n\n      The Supreme Court has provided guidance for applying\nStrickland to determine whether counsel’s “deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n687, at the penalty phase of a capital case. To make this\nprejudice determination, a court generally proceeds through\nthree steps: (1) evaluating and weighing the totality of the\navailable mitigation evidence, see Williams, 529 U.S. at\n397–98; Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1408–10; (2) evaluating and\nweighing the aggravating evidence and any rebuttal evidence\nthat could have been adduced by the government had the\nmitigating evidence been introduced, Williams, 529 U.S. at\n397–98; Pinholster, 131 S.Ct. at 1408–10, and (3) reweighing\nthe evidence in aggravation against the totality of available\nmitigating evidence, see Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945,\n955–56 (2010) (per curiam); Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534;\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98, to determine “whether there is\na reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer\n. . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances did not warrant death,” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695. We explain the Supreme Court’s guidance\non each of these steps.\n\n                              1\n\n    The first step in determining whether counsel’s deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty phase is\nevaluating “the totality of the available mitigation evidence.”\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98. The evidence to be evaluated\nincludes both evidence that was actually presented at\nsentencing and evidence that a competent attorney would\nhave introduced. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534–35. We may\nassume that a competent attorney would have considered\npresenting all of the evidence adduced in post-conviction\n\f24                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nproceedings. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U.S. 15, 20 (2009)\n(per curiam).\n\n    Mitigation evidence is a broad category, as a jury must be\npermitted to consider all relevant mitigating factors. Lockett\nv. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 608 (1978) (plurality opinion);\nEddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110–12 (1982). The\nSupreme Court has identified several non-exclusive\ncategories of mitigation evidence, focusing primarily on\nevidence that aids the jury’s evaluation of a defendant’s\nmoral culpability. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535. For\ninstance, evidence of a defendant’s disadvantaged\nbackground may lead a jury to conclude the defendant is “less\nculpable than defendants who have no such excuse.” Penry\nv. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002). Thus, a defendant who had a\nchildhood “filled with abuse and privation,” including being\nraised by parents who were eventually imprisoned for\ncriminal child neglect, could influence a jury’s appraisal of\nthe defendant’s moral culpability. Williams, 529 U.S at 395,\n398; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535 (mitigating evidence\nincluded evidence that the defendant suffered severe privation\nand abuse as a child, had an alcoholic and absent mother, was\nphysically and sexually abused in foster care, and was\nhomeless for a brief period); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.\n374, 391–93 (2005) (mitigating evidence included evidence\nthat the defendant was raised in a slum by severely abusive,\nalcoholic parents, who did not provide for him and isolated\nhim).\n\n    Similarly, evidence of a defendant’s mental or emotional\ndifficulties may lead a jury to conclude that a defendant is\nless culpable than defendants without such difficulties.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        25\n\nPenry, 492 U.S. at 319. For instance, evidence that a\ndefendant is “borderline mentally retarded,” Williams,\n529 U.S. at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted), or has\nsevere PTSD from military combat, see Porter v. McCollum,\n558 U.S. 30, 35–36 & n.4, 43–44 (2009), or has severe\nlearning and behavioral disabilities, frontal lobe injuries, and\nbrain damage from drug and alcohol abuse, see Sears,\n561 U.S. at 948–49, is potentially mitigating evidence.\n\n    Evidence of conduct or behavior demonstrating the\ndefendant’s good character may also be mitigating. In\nWilliams, the Court gave weight to evidence that the\ndefendant had turned himself in, alerted police to a previously\nundetected crime, expressed remorse, cooperated with police,\nand behaved well in prison. 529 U.S. at 369, 396, 398. In\nBelmontes, the Court noted mitigation evidence that the\ndefendant had maintained strong relationships with family\nmembers in spite of his terrible childhood, and that while in\nprison, he assisted others through a prison religious program\nand rose to second in command in a fire crew. 558 U.S. at\n21.\n\n    After identifying the evidence that the petitioner claims to\nbe mitigating, a court must weigh its strength by assessing its\nlikely impact on a jury. This weighing process includes\nevaluating whether its impact on the jury might be\naggravating rather than mitigating. See Pinholster, 131 S. Ct.\nat 1410. The Supreme Court has indicated that courts can\nconsider the fact that mitigation “may be in the eye of the\nbeholder,” and juries may find that some evidence offered as\nmitigation cuts the other way. Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776,\n794 (1987) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn Burger, the Court noted that “[o]n one hand, a jury could\nreact with sympathy over the tragic childhood” of the\n\f26                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndefendant, while on the other hand, the same testimony could\nestablish the defendant’s “unpredictable propensity for\nviolence” that resulted in murder. Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Similarly, evidence of mental and emotional\nproblems might suggest an increased likelihood that a\ndefendant would be dangerous in the future. See Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1410 (noting that evidence of the defendant’s\nfamily background, their substance abuse, and their mental\nhealth issues, was “by no means clearly mitigating, as the jury\nmight have concluded that [the defendant] was simply beyond\nrehabilitation”). The Court has also observed that evidence\nof the defendant’s normal youth might, in the jury’s eyes,\nestablish greater moral culpability on the part of the\ndefendant. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 701–02 (2002).\n\n                              2\n\n    The second step in determining whether counsel’s\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty\nphase is evaluating the weight of the aggravating evidence\nand any rebuttal evidence that could have been adduced by\nthe government had the mitigating evidence been introduced.\nSee Williams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at\n1408–10. Aggravating evidence may include evidence\nrelating to the circumstances of the crime. Thus in\nStrickland, the Court found the aggravating evidence to be\n“overwhelming” where the defendant had repeatedly stabbed\nthe three murder victims during a robbery. 466 U.S. at 674,\n700. Similarly, where the record showed that the defendant\nhad bludgeoned a woman to death with 15 to 20 blows of a\nsteel dumbbell bar to steal goods worth a mere $100, the\nSupreme Court agreed with the state court that the\naggravating evidence was “simply overwhelming” and\ndetermined that counsel’s failure to introduce certain\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       27\n\nmitigating evidence was not prejudicial. Belmontes, 558 U.S.\nat 15–16, 26–27 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Bobby\nv. Van Hook, the Supreme Court gave weight to evidence that\nthe murder was committed in the course of a scheme to rob\nhomosexual men by luring them into secluded settings.\n558 U.S. 4, 12–13 (2009) (per curiam). In doing so, the\nCourt clarified that the weight, not the number, of the\naggravating factors was important. Id.\n\n    Evidence about a defendant’s prior criminal history is also\naggravating and can be introduced in rebuttal, and a severe\ncriminal history carries great weight. See Woodford v.\nVisciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 26–27 (2002) (criminal history that\nincluded “the knifing of one man, and the stabbing of a\npregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her unborn\nbaby,” combined with the circumstances of the crime, was\n“overwhelming” and “devastating” aggravating evidence);\naccord Bell, 535 U.S. at 700 & n.5 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would elicit information\nabout defendant’s criminal history, which included robberies,\nin rebuttal); Burger, 483 U.S. at 793 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would introduce the\ndefendant’s juvenile criminal history in rebuttal, when he had\na clean adult record). Evidence that a defendant had\npreviously committed another murder may be “the most\npowerful imaginable aggravating evidence.” Belmontes,\n558 U.S. at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Rebuttal evidence may also directly undermine the value\nof the mitigation evidence. For example, the Supreme Court\nnoted in Pinholster that it would be “of questionable\nmitigating value” for defense counsel to introduce expert\ntestimony diagnosing a defendant with bipolar mood disorder\nand seizure disorders, because such evidence would invite\n\f28                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nrebuttal by a state expert, who could reject the diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder and offer a different diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1396, 1410.\n\n                               3\n\n    Finally, the third step in determining whether counsel’s\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty\nphase is to “reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the\ntotality of available mitigating evidence,” Wiggins, 539 U.S.\nat 534, in order to determine “whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would\nhave concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n695. A “reasonable probability” is a level of probability that\n“undermine[s] confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694.\nHowever, counsel’s deficient performance is not prejudicial\nmerely because the court cannot “rule out” the possibility\nthat the sentencer would have imposed a sentence of life in\nprison instead of the death penalty. Belmontes, 558 U.S. at\n20, 27 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Richter,\n562 U.S. at 111 (“In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the\nquestion is not whether a court can be certain counsel’s\nperformance had no effect on the outcome . . . .”). Rather,\n“[t]he likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not\njust conceivable.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112 (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693). Thus, “the difference between Strickland’s\nprejudice standard and a more-probable-than-not standard is\nslight and matters ‘only in the rarest case.’” Id. (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 697).\n\n    The Court has found a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome when only scant and weak aggravating\nevidence could have been presented in rebuttal to strongly\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       29\n\nmitigating evidence. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534–36,\n537–38 (holding that there was a reasonable probability that\nthe jury would have reached a different result at sentencing\nhad it heard powerful mitigating evidence regarding the\ndefendant’s childhood background, when the state could have\npresented only weak rebuttal evidence). By contrast, the\nCourt has found no prejudice when the aggravating evidence\nis overwhelming, even though the mitigating evidence is\nstrong. See Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 26–27 (holding that there\nwas no reasonable probability of a different result when the\nmitigating evidence, including the defendant’s “troubled\nfamily background” and possible seizure disorder, did not\noutweigh the “overwhelming” aggravating factors, including\nthe circumstances of the crime and potential rebuttal evidence\nof prior offenses).\n\n    In reweighing aggravating and mitigating evidence, the\nCourt has also examined whether mitigating evidence would\nbe merely cumulative or would have significantly altered the\ninformation provided to the sentencer. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 699–700; Porter, 558 U.S. at 41–42. In\nStrickland, the new information “would barely have altered”\nthe picture presented at sentencing, and the Court found no\nprejudice. 466 U.S. at 699–700. Similarly, in Belmontes, the\nCourt concluded that merely cumulative evidence regarding\na petitioner’s difficult childhood, and expert testimony\nregarding a petitioner’s mental state “seeking to explain his\nbehavior, or putting it in some favorable context” would not\noutweigh the facts of a brutal murder, and would be even less\nlikely to outweigh evidence that the defendant had committed\na prior murder. 558 U.S. at 22–24, 27–28. Accordingly, the\nCourt concluded that any failure of counsel to present\nadditional mitigating evidence was not prejudicial. Id. at 27.\n\f30                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    These Supreme Court opinions suggest that under\nStrickland’s prejudice prong, cumulative mitigating evidence\ndoes not support a conclusion that there would be a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome. New\nmitigating evidence can support such a conclusion only if it\nis sufficiently strong, and the known or additional\naggravating evidence is not overwhelming.\n\n                                    C\n\n     In light of this guidance, we now evaluate the California\nSupreme Court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim that he was\nprejudiced by his counsel’s failure to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his\ntrial. We must determine whether this decision was “contrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of,” Strickland or\nother Supreme Court precedent in existence at the time of its\nopinion. § 2254(d)(1); see Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1399.\n\n    In considering whether any deficiency by Andrews’s\ncounsel was prejudicial, the California Supreme Court\ncorrectly followed Strickland in asking whether, even if\ncounsel was deficient, Andrews’s defense was not prejudiced\nby any such deficiency because a different result was not\nreasonably probable.5 See In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671\n\n\n   5\n     Andrews argues that the state court failed to apply the correct legal\nstandard established in Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274 (2004) and Smith\nv. Texas, 543 U.S. 37 (2004), because it dismissed Andrews’s mitigating\nevidence on the ground that the evidence was not unambiguously\nmitigating, and implied that there must be some connection between the\nmitigating evidence not introduced at the penalty phase and the crimes.\nWe disagree. Tennard and Smith require a sentencer to have the\nopportunity to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence,\nbut do not specify what weight the sentencer must give such evidence.\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              31\n\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). The California\nSupreme Court then reasonably carried out the three steps\nindicated by Supreme Court opinions for evaluating prejudice\nat the penalty phase.\n\n                                    1\n\n    The court first considered the totality of the mitigating\nevidence presented at trial, as well as what mitigation could\nhave been presented by a competent attorney, based on the\nsix-year review and report by the referee. See Williams,\n529 U.S. at 397–98. The court reviewed all of the mitigating\nevidence that Andrews presented, including Andrews’s\nfamily background, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660, 670,\nincarceration in Mt. Meigs and in Alabama prisons,6 id. at\n\n\n\nSee Eddings, 455 U.S. at 114–15 (“The sentencer . . . may determine the\nweight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But [courts] may not give\nit no weight by excluding such evidence from their consideration.”).\nHere, the California Supreme Court correctly considered all mitigating\nevidence before weighing its likely effect on a jury. See Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1410.\n 6\n   Andrews’s claim that the state court failed to consider his experiences\nat Mt. Meigs, is not supported by the record. The state court detailed\nAndrews’s experiences at Mt. Meigs when discussing mitigating evidence\nthat could have been presented, noting that “[a]t Mt. Meigs, [Andrews]\nencountered appalling conditions” and detailing the referee’s findings that\nAndrews was “was subjected to beatings, brutality, inadequate conditions\nand sexual predators,” that “[h]is passiveness and small physique caused\nhim to be a target of older, tougher boys, from whom no protection or\nseparation was provided,” and that “Mt. Meigs failed to provide any\nmeaningful rehabilitative or educational opportunities.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 660–61 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state court also\nnoted that expert testimony would have addressed his drug use at Mt.\nMeigs. Id. at 661. Moreover, the state court’s use of the term “prison\n\f32                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n660–61, 670–71, and mental health evidence, id. at 661–62,\n670, observing that the similar types of mitigating evidence\nhave been considered in Supreme Court precedent, id. at\n672–75; see Penry, 492 U.S. at 319; Williams, 529 U.S. at\n395–98.\n\n     The California Supreme Court then evaluated the strength\nof this mitigating evidence by considering, among other\nthings, whether it might be viewed by a jury as aggravating.\nSee Burger, 483 U.S. at 793; Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410.\nIt reasonably concluded that much of the evidence identified\nas mitigating “was not conclusively and unambiguously\nmitigating,” and it evaluated the possibility that the evidence\ncould be rebutted or used to Andrews’s disadvantage, or that\ncross examination might “deflate the mitigating impact” of\nthe evidence. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670 & n.9. The court\nreasonably observed that a jury could have determined that\nAndrews’s family background did not reduce his moral\nculpability, given that Andrews was raised in a non-abusive,\nstable family situation. Id. at 670; cf. Bell, 535 U.S. at\n701–02 (suggesting that evidence of a normal youth might\n“cut the other way”). The court reasonably concluded that\n“[Andrews] did not suffer a home environment that would\nplace his crimes in any understandable context or explain his\nresorting to crime every time he was released or escaped from\nprison.” Id. at 670.\n\n    In addition, the state court reasonably determined that the\nevidence regarding the prison conditions was double-edged.\nOn the one hand, the prison conditions evidence left it in “no\ndoubt [that Andrews] endured horrifically demeaning and\n\n\nconditions” in its opinion is consistent with its use in the referee’s report,\nwhere the term referred to conditions both in prison and Mt. Meigs.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              33\n\ndegrading circumstances.” Id. On the other hand, the\nevidence would be presented primarily through the testimony\nof Andrews’s former fellow inmates, who had serious\ncriminal records that could “draw[] an unfavorable\ncomparison” with Andrews. Id. at 671. “Many had\nthemselves engaged in brutality while in prison and escaped\nwith some frequency,” also similar to Andrews. Id.\nMoreover, no matter how the prison conditions evidence was\npresented, “[r]ather than engendering sympathy, the evidence\ncould well have reinforced an impression of him as a person\nwho had become desensitized and inured to violence and\ndisrespect for the law.”7 Id.; cf. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at\n1410.\n\n                                    2\n\n     After assessing the weight of the mitigating evidence and\nits likely impact on a jury, the state court followed Supreme\nCourt guidance by turning to evaluate the weight of the\naggravating evidence at trial, as well as any additional\nrebuttal evidence that could have been introduced. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 20,\n24–28. Consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the state\ncourt considered the circumstances of Andrews’s crime and\nthe nature of his prior criminal history. Turning to the\ncircumstances of the crimes, the state court stated that the\nmurders showed a “callous disregard for human life.” In re\n\n\n    7\n       Andrews argues that the state court made an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts, see § 2254(d)(2), in holding that the prison\nconditions evidence could be aggravating. We reject this argument,\nbecause the state court’s conclusion is a reasonable application of the\nprejudice standard elaborated by Strickland and its progeny, not a factual\nfinding. Cf. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410.\n\f34                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 671; cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 674, 700;\nBelmontes, 558 U.S. at 15, 26–27. Andrews did not\nimpulsively react to a situation that got out of hand; rather, he\ninteracted with the victims in a calm and normal manner\nbefore torturing and killing them. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n671. He also did more than simply kill the victims. He raped\nand sodomized Brandon before murdering her, and he also\nmurdered Wheeler and Chism with “considerable violence\nand evident sangfroid.” Id. The state court also considered\nthat, as rebuttal evidence, the prosecution could have\npresented the details of Andrews’s criminal history, cf. Bell,\n535 U.S. at 700 & n.5; Burger, 483 U.S. at 793, from which\nthe jury might conclude Andrews was “aggressive and\ndesensitized to violence,” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 669. The\njury might also have concluded that this “pattern of\ncriminality” showed Andrews “would pose a danger to others\nif he were sentenced to life imprisonment.”8 Id. Also, the\n\n 8\n   Andrews argues that the state court’s conclusion that the evidence gave\nrise to the inference of future dangerousness was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. He argues that the prison stabbings, laundry\nrobbery, and conditioning to violence during his prison experiences do not\nsupport such an inference, pointing to mitigating facts found by the\nreferee, including that in some incidents, Andrews was defending himself\nagainst inmates who had been threatening him. We disagree. The state\ncourt considered these mitigating facts (such as evidence that in prison\nAndrews was “the prey rather than the predator” and acted in self\ndefense), see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660–61, and reasonably concluded\nthat the evidence that Andrews was conditioned to violence during his\nprison experiences was an aggravating, not mitigating, circumstance, see\nBurger, 483 U.S. at 793 (noting that evidence of a petitioner’s troubled\nfamily background could also “suggest violent tendencies” that could\naffect the jury adversely). Because the state court reasonably concluded\nthat the jury could have found future dangerousness even had the\nmitigating evidence been introduced, the state court did not unreasonably\napply Supreme Court precedent in weighing how the evidence might\nimpact a jury.\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              35\n\nreferences to Andrews’s multiple escapes from prison might\nhave been “inflammatory.” Id.\n\n    Finally, the state court reasonably concluded that the\nprosecution could have presented its own mental health\nexperts in rebuttal, and could have used the mental health\nevidence to Andrews’s disadvantage on cross examination.\nId. at 670. The court noted the referee’s findings that\nprosecution experts could have testified that Andrews had\nnormal intelligence and did not suffer brain damage, but had\nantisocial personality traits.9 Id.; cf. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at\n1396, 1410. Nor was the state court unreasonable in\nconcluding that Andrews’s experts’ testimony could backfire.\nFor instance, the court noted that the “compelling” testimony\nfrom one of Andrews’s expert psychiatric witnesses, opining\nthat Andrews’s prison experience caused him to react with\nrage to perceived insults, could cause a jury to conclude that\nAndrews “was unable to control lethal impulses on the\nslightest provocation.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670; cf.\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410. Finally, the presentation of the\nmental health evidence would have given the prosecutor\nadditional opportunities to repeat the circumstances of these\ncrimes as well as Andrews’s past criminality. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 670.\n\n\n\n\n  9\n    Andrews argues that the state court unreasonably applied Eddings,\n455 U.S. at 114–15, in concluding that a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder is not mitigating. Eddings is not on point, because it\nmerely held that a court cannot prevent a jury from hearing such evidence.\nId. The state court did not unreasonably apply Eddings, or any other\nSupreme Court precedent, by observing that evidence that Andrews had\nantisocial personality disorder might make him less sympathetic to the\njury. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71.\n\f36                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n                                   3\n\n    After evaluating the mitigating and aggravating evidence,\nthe state court re-weighed it and assessed whether it was\nreasonably probable that, in the absence of any deficient\nperformance by counsel, the sentencer “would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 695; see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671–75. The state court\napplied the relevant Supreme Court precedent, and concluded\nthat Andrews was not “prejudiced by counsel’s rejection of\na defense premised on evidence of [Andrews]’s upbringing,\nthe Alabama prison conditions he experienced, and his mental\nhealth in light of the circumstances of the crimes, given the\nambiguous nature of some mitigating evidence and the\nsubstantial potential for damaging rebuttal.” Id. at 671.\n\n    Relying on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Williams\nand Porter, Andrews argues that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision on the issue of prejudice was an\nunreasonable application of Strickland.10 In Williams, the\nSupreme Court held that the state court applied the wrong\nlegal standard, 529 U.S. at 395–97, and so applied Strickland\nde novo to the facts of that case, id. at 397–98; see also\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410–11. The state court here\ndiscussed Williams at length and reasonably distinguished it\nas having “substantially dissimilar facts.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 675. In Williams, for instance, the defense counsel\ncould have introduced strong character evidence, 529 U.S. at\n\n\n 10\n    While Andrews cites other Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases, his\nargument focuses primarily on Williams and Porter. Because other cases\ncited by Andrews are non-binding, not factually analogous, or both, we do\nnot address them here.\n\f                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS                            37\n\n398, but no comparable evidence of good character was\npresent in Andrews’s case.11 The defendant’s “nightmarish\nchildhood” in Williams, 529 U.S. at 395, 398, was far worse\nthan Andrews’s relatively stable family background, see In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 674. The defendant in Williams was\n“borderline mentally retarded,” 529 U.S. at 396, 398 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), while the prosecution could have\npresented evidence that Andrews was not mentally impaired,\nbut rather had antisocial personality traits, In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 670. The only rebuttal evidence in Williams was\nthe defendant’s three juvenile convictions, 529 U.S. at 396,\ncompared to Andrews’s robbery-murder, hostage taking, and\nhistory of escape from prison, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 675.\nFinally, the circumstances of the crime in Williams were less\nbrutal than Andrews’s triple murder, id., because the\ndefendant in Williams killed the severely inebriated victim\nwith one blow each to the chest and back after an argument,\n529 U.S. at 367–68 & n.1. Because the facts of Williams are\ndissimilar, the Supreme Court’s determination in Williams\nthat counsel’s ineffective assistance was prejudicial does not\nmake the state court’s contrary conclusion here unreasonable.\n See Richter, 562 U.S. at 101–02; see also Pinholster, 131 S.\nCt. at 1410–11.\n\n    Andrews also argues that the state court’s decision was\nunreasonable in light of Porter. Although Porter was decided\nyears after the California Supreme Court’s opinion in this\ncase, we give it careful consideration, because it provides\ndirection for determining under AEDPA what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of Strickland. In Porter, the\n\n\n  11\n     Andrews points to evidence that he appeared to adjust well to the\nAlabama prison system when conditions permitted, but this observation\nis weaker than the evidence in Williams. See 529 U.S. at 396.\n\f38                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nSupreme Court faulted the state court for failing to consider\nall of the mitigating evidence regarding the defendant’s\nfamily background, military service, and mental health issues.\nFor instance, the state court entirely discounted the effect that\nevidence of the defendant’s brain abnormality and cognitive\ndefects might have on a jury. See Porter, 558 U.S. at 42–44.\nFurther, the state court unreasonably discounted mitigating\nevidence of childhood abuse and the defendant’s long record\nof military service. Id. at 43–44. Applying AEDPA, Porter\nheld that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland\nwhen it held that counsel’s failure to introduce this substantial\nmitigation evidence was not prejudicial. Id. at 44.\n\n    The state court’s determinations in Porter are not closely\nanalogous to the state court’s determinations in this case.\nUnlike the state court in Porter, the state court here\nconsidered all mitigation evidence in the record and did not\nfail to consider or “discount to irrelevance” significant\nevidence. See Porter, 558 U.S. at 43. The mitigation\nevidence in Porter, including that the defendant served in\n“horrific” battles of the Korean War, suffered childhood\nphysical abuse, and had a brain abnormality, see id. at 41, is\nless subject to rebuttal than the mitigation evidence in this\ncase, see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71. Unlike here,\nwhere the state’s mental health expert disagreed with the\ndefense experts’ conclusions and added a diagnosis of\nantisocial personality disorder, see id. at 670, in Porter, state\nexperts could not rule out the defense experts’ mental health\ndiagnosis, and the state court erred by failing to consider this\nevidence at all, see 558 U.S. at 36, 42–43. Likewise,\nevidence that the defendant had gone AWOL did not\ndiminish evidence of his military service to “inconsequential\nproportions,” because our nation has a tradition of “according\nleniency to veterans,” and the evidence was “consistent with\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              39\n\n[the] theory of mitigation and [did] not impeach or diminish\nthe evidence of his service.” Id. at 43–44 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, by contrast, the state court found that\nAndrews “endured horrifically demeaning and degrading\ncircumstances” in prison before acknowledging this evidence\nwas “double-edged,” because it would also bring before the\njury Andrews’s history of violence both in and out of prison\nand his escapes, which would be emphasized by their\nsimilarity to many of the witnesses who would testify for\nhim. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71. Further, while the\nstate court here reasonably determined that the prosecution\ncould introduce damaging aggravating evidence, id. at 671,\n675, in Porter, the Supreme Court held that the amount of\naggravating evidence would be reduced, because one of the\naggravating factors was invalid, 558 U.S. at 42. Because\nPorter is factually distinct from this case, it has little bearing\non the question whether the state court unreasonably applied\nthe prejudice prong of Strickland.12\n\n    Visciotti, another Supreme Court case that provides\ndirection for determining under AEDPA what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of Strickland, is more closely on\npoint. In Visciotti, the Supreme Court considered a state\ncourt’s rejection of a defendant’s Strickland claim. 537 U.S.\nat 26. The state court had weighed the mitigating evidence,\nincluding the defendant’s brain damage, difficult family\n\n  12\n    Andrews also urges us to apply our recent decision in Doe v. Ayers,\n782 F.3d 425 (9th Cir. 2015), where we concluded that the defendant was\nprejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance in failing to investigate and\npresent mitigating evidence, including evidence of his rape in prison. Doe\nv. Ayers is not pertinent to our analysis here because it is a pre-AEDPA\ncase that does not examine whether the state court’s conclusion was\nunreasonable. See id. at 446, n.31. Nor is Doe clearly established law as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court. See § 2254(d)(1).\n\f40                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nbackground, and possible seizure disorder, against the\naggravating factors, including the circumstances of the crime\n(the cold-blooded killing of two victims during a robbery)\nand his criminal history of knifing a man and stabbing a\npregnant woman in bed “trying to protect her unborn baby,”\nand concluded that the defendant had suffered no prejudice.\nSee id. at 25–26. After the defendant filed a habeas petition,\nthe district court granted relief and we affirmed. We\nreasoned that counsel’s deficient performance was\nprejudicial, because the “aggravating factors were not\noverwhelming.” Id. at 21–22, 25 (quoting Visciotti v.\nWoodford, 288 F.3d 1097, 1118 (9th Cir. 2002)). The\nSupreme Court reversed.             It explained that “under\n§ 2254(d)(1), it is not enough to convince a federal habeas\ncourt that, in its independent judgment, the state-court\ndecision applied Strickland incorrectly.” Id. at 27 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Rather, “[t]he federal habeas\nscheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for\nthese judgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention\nonly when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable.\nIt is not that here.” Id. In sum, the Court held that “[w]hether\nor not we would reach the same conclusion as the California\nSupreme Court, we think at the very least that the state\ncourt’s contrary assessment was not ‘unreasonable.’” Id.\n(quoting Bell, 535 U.S. at 701) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    Here, as in Visciotti, the state court reweighed Andrews’s\nmitigating evidence against the brutal circumstances of the\ncrime and Andrews’s prior criminal history, and determined\nthere was no reasonable probability that the sentencer would\ndetermine that “the balance of aggravating and mitigating\nfactors did not warrant imposition of the death penalty.” Id.\nat 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). This decision was\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              41\n\nnot objectively unreasonable, and therefore we are bound to\nconclude that “[w]hether or not we would reach the same\nconclusion,” we cannot say the California Supreme Court’s\nconclusion was an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nSee id. at 27.\n\n   Because the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not contrary\nto or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court\nprecedent, we may not grant relief on this claim.\n§ 2254(d)(1). We therefore reverse the district court’s\ncontrary conclusion.13\n\n                                   III\n\n    Having addressed the state’s cross-appeal, we now turn to\nAndrews’s appeal of the district court’s dismissal of his sole\ncertified claim (Claim 25) that California’s use of its lethal\ninjection protocol to execute him would violate his Eighth\nAmendment rights. According to the district court, the\nCalifornia lethal injection protocol mirrored the Kentucky\nlethal injection protocol upheld by the Supreme Court against\nan Eighth Amendment challenge in Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35\n(2008). The court reasoned that in light of Baze’s ruling, it\nwould be impossible for Andrews to succeed on his challenge\nto California’s lethal injection protocol, and therefore rejected\nthis claim.\n\n\n  13\n    Because we decide Andrews’s claim on prejudice grounds, we need\nnot address the parties’ arguments regarding whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient at the penalty phase. Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n697. We also need not consider the additional aggravating evidence put\nforth by the state, which Andrews disputes, and therefore deny the state’s\nmotion for judicial notice of these additional materials.\n\f42                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    At the time the district court ruled in July 2009, California\ndid not have a lethal injection protocol in place. As explained\nin Sims v. Dep’t of Corrections, the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has the responsibility\nfor developing a procedure for executions by lethal injection.\n216 Cal. App. 4th 1059, 1064 (2013). In December 2006, a\nfederal district court ruled that CDCR’s procedure violated\nthe Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment. Id. (citing Morales v. Tilton, 465 F. Supp. 2d\n972 (N.D. Cal. 2006)). Although the CDCR substantially\nrevised its protocol in 2007, a state trial court invalidated the\nrevised procedure on the ground that it violated the state’s\nadministrative procedure act. Id. After losing its appeal,\nCDCR promulgated a new procedure, which took effect on\nAugust 29, 2010. Id. at 1064–65. In response to a new legal\nchallenge, a trial court again invalidated the CDCR lethal\ninjection procedure for failure to comply with the state\nadministrative procedure act and permanently enjoined the\nCDCR from administering executions by lethal injection until\nit promulgated new regulations. Id. at 1066–67. This\ninjunction was upheld on appeal. Id. at 1083–84. Andrews’s\nsupplemental brief on appeal informed the court that\nCalifornia had no lethal injection protocol in place as of\nNovember 12, 2014, and the parties have not informed us of\nany change since that date. Our research reveals none.14\n\n    It is premature to rule on the constitutionality of a state’s\nlethal injection protocol if the state does not have one in\nplace. See Payton v. Cullen, 658 F.3d 890, 893 (9th Cir.\n\n\n 14\n    Pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by a state court in June\n2015, the CDCR agreed to begin the process of promulgating a new lethal\ninjection protocol. Winchell v. Beard, No. 34-2014-80001968 (Cal. Super.\nCt. June 3, 2015).\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                            43\n\n2011). Therefore, the district court erred in entertaining this\nclaim, and we dismiss it as unripe.15\n\n                                     IV\n\n    Andrews also raises several uncertified claims based on\nthe following legal theories: (1) unconstitutional delay\nbetween sentencing and execution under Lackey v. Texas,\n514 U.S. 1045 (1995) (Stevens, J., statement respecting\ndenial of certiorari); (2) ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder Strickland; (3) failure to disclose material exculpatory\nevidence and false testimony under Brady v. Maryland,\n373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269\n(1959); and (4) destruction of evidence in violation of due\nprocess under California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479 (1984),\nand its progeny. He also raises uncertified claims based on\ncumulative error and factual innocence.\n\n    We first turn to the question whether Andrews must\nobtain a COA for these claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).16\n\n\n\n 15\n    In light of this holding, we need not reach Andrews’s claims that the\ndistrict court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing on Claim 25 or\nin declining to stay this claim to allow him to rely on evidence presented\nin Morales.\n 16\n      Section 2253(c) states:\n\n           (c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a\n           certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken\n           to the court of appeals from–\n\n               (A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\n           in which the detention complained of arises out of\n           process issued by a State court; or\n\f44                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nOur analysis of this question is governed by Jennings v.\nStephens, which considered whether a habeas petitioner who\nobtained relief in the district court could defend this judgment\non alternate grounds without taking a cross-appeal and\nobtaining a COA. 135 S. Ct. 793, 798 (2015). Jennings held\nthat a habeas petitioner in such circumstances need not take\na cross-appeal so long as the petitioner did not attempt to\ndefend the district court’s judgment on a theory that seeks “to\nenlarge his rights or lessen the State’s under the District\nCourt’s judgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798,\n801–02.17 Further, because “§ 2253(c) applies only when ‘an\nappeal’ is ‘taken to the court of appeals,’” id. at 802 (quoting\n§ 2253(c)), a petitioner who does not have to take a cross-\nappeal does not need a COA, id. Applying this rule, Jennings\nnoted that the district court’s judgment granting the petitioner\nrelief at the penalty phase of his trial entitled him “to release,\nresentencing, or commutation, at the State’s option.” Id. at\n799. Accordingly, “[a]ny potential claim that would have\nentitled [the petitioner] to a new sentencing proceeding could\n\n\n             (B) the final order in a proceeding under section\n         2255.\n\n         (2) A certificate of appealability may issue under\n         paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a\n         substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n         right.\n\n         (3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1)\n         shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the\n         showing required by paragraph (2).\n  17\n     Jennings was nonetheless careful to note that a petitioner defending\nhis judgment on appeal would be “confined to those alternative grounds\npresent in the record: he may not simply argue any alternative basis,\nregardless of its origin.” Jennings, 135 S. Ct. at 800.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             45\n\nhave been advanced to ‘urge . . . support’ of the judgment,”\nid. at 800 (last alteration in original) (quoting United States\nv. Am. Ry. Express Co., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924)). Neither\na cross-appeal nor a COA would be required. Id. at 800–02.\nBy contrast, “[a] habeas applicant who has won resentencing\nwould be required to take a cross-appeal in order to raise a\nrejected claim that would result in a new trial.” Id. at 800.\nAnd “if a habeas applicant has won retrial below, a claim that\nhis conduct was constitutionally beyond the power of the\nState to punish would require cross-appeal.” Id. In both such\ncases, a COA would also have been required. See id. at 802.\n\n    Here, Andrews won relief at the district court based on his\ntheory of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of his trial. The district court ordered that “the State of\nCalifornia shall, within 120 days from the entry of this\nJudgment, either grant Petitioner a new penalty phase trial, or\nvacate the death sentence and resentence the Petitioner in\naccordance with California law and the United States\nConstitution.” Accordingly, Andrews’s rights under this\njudgment were for a new penalty phase trial or resentencing\nwithin a fixed time, and Andrews may urge any potential\nclaim present in the record that would entitle him to a new\npenalty phase trial or resentencing without taking a cross-\nappeal or obtaining a COA. See id. at 800–02.\n\n    But none of Andrews’s uncertified claims support the\ndistrict court’s judgment. Five of his claims seek a new guilt\nphase trial (his Strickland, Brady/Napue, Trombetta, and\ncumulative error claims, and a factual innocence claim).18 As\n\n\n 18\n    While the Supreme Court has not ruled on the question whether a free-\nstanding claim of factual innocence is cognizable in habeas, it has\nsuggested that success on such a claim (if cognizable) would entitle a\n\f46                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nexplained in Jennings, because Andrews won resentencing,\nhe must take a cross-appeal and obtain a COA to raise a claim\nthat results in a new trial. Id. His Lackey claim seeks a ruling\nthat the death penalty cannot be constitutionally imposed on\nhim. Because the district court’s order gave the state the right\nto seek the death penalty at a new penalty phase trial,\nAndrews’s Lackey and factual innocence claims seek to\n“lessen the State’s [rights] under the District Court’s\njudgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798. Under\nJennings, Andrews must bring a cross-appeal and obtain a\nCOA to raise these claims as well.\n\n    We lack jurisdiction to consider uncertified claims unless\nwe determine that Andrews “has made a substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right” and grant a COA.\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); see also Ninth Circuit Rule 22-1(e)\n(“Uncertified issues raised and designated [in a petitioner’s\nopening brief] will be construed as a motion to expand the\nCOA . . . .”). This standard requires habeas petitioners to\nmake a “showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether\n(or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been\nresolved in a different manner or that the issues presented\nwere adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.”\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).            Because the statute is\njurisdictional, it does not permit “full consideration of the\nfactual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims”;\nrather, courts may make only a “threshold inquiry” to\ndetermine whether the statutory standard is met. Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003). As the Supreme Court\ndirected in Miller-El, rather than “[d]eciding the substance of\n\n\npetitioner to a new guilt phase trial. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390,\n403, 405, 417 (1993).\n\f                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         47\n\nan appeal,” id. at 342, we “look to the District Court’s\napplication of AEDPA to petitioner’s constitutional claims,”\nid. at 336, in light of a “fair interpretation of the record,” id.\nat 345, and ask whether “reasonable jurists would find the\ndistrict court’s assessment of the constitutional claims\ndebatable or wrong,” id. at 338.\n\n                                A\n\n    We first consider Andrews’s claim that his execution\nwould violate the Eighth Amendment due to the long delay\nbetween his sentence and execution. Andrews did not raise\nthis claim in his opening brief on appeal, but moved to file a\nsupplemental brief raising this claim after a district court\nissued a decision holding that under Furman v. Georgia,\n408 U.S. 238 (1972) and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153\n(1976), California’s death penalty system violated the Eighth\nAmendment because its “dysfunctional administration”\nresulted in “inordinate and unpredictable” periods of delay\nbefore execution, such that executions do not serve a\nretributive or deterrent purpose and will be arbitrary. See\nJones v. Chappell, 31 F. Supp. 3d 1050, 1053, 1061–62, 1069\n(C.D. Cal. 2014). We granted his motion, and ordered the\nstate to respond.\n\n    In his brief, Andrews stated that he raised this claim to the\ndistrict court as Claim 26. In Claim 26, Andrews had argued\nthat executing him after 22 years on death row would be cruel\nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment and would serve no retributive or deterrent\npenological purpose. Claim 26 also asserted that Andrews\ndid not cause any unnecessary delays, but merely sought to\nvindicate his constitutional rights in a system that produced\n\f48                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndelays. Andrews exhausted this claim by raising it to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, which summarily denied it.\n\n    The district court rejected this claim on the merits on the\nground that there has been no demonstration of “any support\nin the American constitutional tradition or in [Supreme\nCourt] precedent for the proposition that a defendant can\navail himself of the panoply of appellate and collateral\nprocedures and then complain when his execution is\ndelayed,” a quote from Knight v. Florida, 528 U.S. 990\n(1999) (Thomas, J., concurring in a denial of certiorari),\nrelied on by two Ninth Circuit cases, Smith v. Mahoney,\n611 F.3d 978, 998 (9th Cir. 2010), and Allen v. Ornoski,\n435 F.3d 946, 958 (9th Cir.2006), as evidence that no\nSupreme Court precedent supports a claim of unconstitutional\ndelay.\n\n    On appeal, Andrews argues that the delay in carrying out\nthe death sentence makes California’s death penalty\nunconstitutional both on its face and as applied to him. After\ndiscussing in detail Jones’s reasoning and conclusion that the\nCalifornia death penalty system is unconstitutional, Andrews\nargues that no fairminded jurist could disagree with such a\nconclusion in his case, because he has been continuously\nconfined under sentence of death for more than 30 years, and\nthe delays are caused by factors outside his control. Andrews\nalso points to separate statements by individual Supreme\nCourt justices questioning the constitutionality of the inherent\ndelay in capital cases. See, e.g., Muhammad v. Florida,\n134 S. Ct. 894 (2014) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of\ncertiorari); Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U.S. 1067 (2009)\n(Stevens, J., joined by Breyer, J., statement respecting denial\nof certiorari); Lackey, 514 U.S. 1045 (Stevens, J., statement\nrespecting denial of certiorari) (stating that a prisoner’s claim\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         49\n\nthat his 17 years on death row violates the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment was “not without foundation,” and encouraging\nstate and federal courts to consider the issue).\n\n    Before we can address this claim, we must consider\nseveral procedural hurdles. As a threshold matter, Andrews\ndid not raise this claim in his opening brief on appeal. While\nwe generally deem a petitioner to have waived any issue not\nraised in an opening brief, see United States v. Ullah,\n976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1992), we recognize exceptions\nto this general rule. Such an exception is applicable here: the\nstate has fully briefed the issue and would suffer no prejudice.\nSee id. Therefore, we conclude we may address this issue.\n\n    Next, the state argues that Andrews’s claim was not fairly\npresented to the California Supreme Court or the district\ncourt, and so is both unexhausted and waived. “A federal\ncourt may not grant habeas relief to a state prisoner unless he\nhas properly exhausted his remedies in state court.” Dickens\nv. Ryan, 740 F.3d 1302, 1317 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc)\n(quoting Peterson v. Lampert, 319 F.3d 1153, 1155 (9th Cir.\n2003) (en banc)). Exhaustion of constitutional claims\nrequires that the claims be “fairly presented” in state court,\nallowing the state courts an “opportunity to act on them.” Id.\nat 1318 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo be fairly presented in state court, a claim must include:\n1) “a statement of the facts that entitle the petitioner to\nrelief,” Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 162–63 (1996),\nand 2) citations “to either a federal or state case involving the\nlegal standard for a federal constitutional violation,” Castillo\nv. McFadden, 399 F.3d 993, 999 (9th Cir. 2005). “A claim\nhas not been fairly presented in state court if new factual\nallegations either fundamentally alter the legal claim already\n\f50                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nconsidered by the state courts, or place the case in a\nsignificantly different and stronger evidentiary posture than\nit was when the state courts considered it.” Dickens, 740 F.3d\nat 1318 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Two\nclaims are distinct and must be separately exhausted if the\nclaims are based on the same facts, but are supported by\ndistinct constitutional theories. See Gray, 518 U.S. at\n163–65.       “[G]eneral appeals to broad constitutional\nprinciples, such as due process, equal protection, and the right\nto a fair trial, are insufficient to establish exhaustion.”\nHiivala v. Wood, 195 F.3d 1098, 1106 (9th Cir. 1999). But\nwhen claims are “sufficiently related” or “intertwined” so that\nraising one clearly implies the other, exhausting one claim\nwill also exhaust the related claim, so long as the failure to\nexplicitly raise the related claim was not a “strategic choice.”\nLounsbury v. Thompson, 374 F.3d 785, 788 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (holding that exhaustion\nof a procedural challenge to petitioner’s competency\ndetermination exhausted a substantive challenge to the same\ndetermination, though the two challenges relied on two\ndistinct Fifth Amendment theories); see also Wooten v.\nKirkland, 540 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n    The state asserts that there is a distinction between the\nsort of Eighth Amendment claim that Andrews raised to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court and in district court (sometimes\nreferred to as a Lackey claim), and the Eighth Amendment\nclaim based on Jones he is raising here, such that the state\ncourts lacked an opportunity to consider it. Specifically, the\nstate argues that a Lackey claim is an individual challenge,\nbased on the theory that executing a prisoner who has spent\nmany years on death row violates the prohibition on cruel and\nunusual punishment of that prisoner, while Jones was based\non the theory that the California system itself creates the\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       51\n\nconstitutional infirmity, because inordinate delay makes the\nsystem arbitrary and unable to serve a deterrent or retributive\npurpose, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n    We disagree. Andrews’s claim before the state court, the\ndistrict court, and on appeal here is essentially the same\nconstitutional claim: that his right to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment is violated\nby his lengthy incarceration while under a sentence of death.\nAndrews has not introduced any new facts or evidence since\nhe raised this argument to the state court. Andrews’s\nsupplemental brief points to Jones’s conclusion that there are\nsystemic delays in imposing the death penalty throughout the\nCalifornia system, but uses this conclusion to support his\nLackey claim that “inherent delay in capital cases” renders\nexecutions unconstitutional.         Accordingly, Andrews’s\nreferences to Jones do not “fundamentally alter the legal\nclaim already considered by the state courts.” Dickens,\n740 F.3d at 1318 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\ntherefore conclude that Andrews’s uncertified claim, as\nbriefed on appeal, is sufficiently related and intertwined with\nClaim 26 such that Andrews’s exhaustion of Claim 26\nlikewise exhausted his current challenge. See Lounsbury,\n374 F.3d at 788. Moreover, Andrews raised this same claim\nto the district court. Accordingly, Andrews exhausted this\ndelay claim and did not waive it.\n\n    We now consider Andrews’s motion for a COA for this\nclaim. The district court denied Claim 26 because the state\ncourt’s rejection of this claim was not an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent. No reasonable jurist\nwould find the district court’s ruling debatable or wrong. See\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484. As we have previously stated, no\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent holds that\n\f52                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ninordinate delay in the execution of a capital defendant\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\nEighth Amendment. Allen, 435 F.3d at 958–60. Andrews\nargues that the state court’s rejection of his delay claim is\ncontrary to Furman, 408 U.S. at 311–12 (White, J.,\nconcurring), and Gregg, 428 U.S. at 188 (plurality opinion).\nBut these cases articulate a general Eighth Amendment\nstandard that the death penalty is unconstitutional if imposed\narbitrarily, or if the penalty itself does not serve the\npenological purposes of deterrence and retribution. These\nprinciples do not “squarely address[]” the specific issue\nraised by Andrews’s delay claim, and would require a\nsignificant extension of the rationale of Furman and Gregg to\napply in this particular context. See Van Patten, 552 U.S. at\n125–26. Therefore, the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s\ndelay claim was not an unreasonable application of Furman\nor Gregg, and reasonable jurists would not dispute the district\ncourt’s conclusion to that effect. See Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at\n1706–07.\n\n    Because Andrews has not made a “substantial showing”\nthat his Eighth Amendment rights were violated, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), we deny a COA for this claim.\n\n                              B\n\n    We next turn to Andrews’s four uncertified claims\nalleging that trial counsel were ineffective under Strickland\nfor failing to investigate and present four categories of\nevidence.\n\n   The first claim relates to the police’s investigation of\nsuspects before Sanders was arrested and agreed to testify\npursuant to a plea agreement. During the investigation,\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       53\n\npolice officers took statements from at least nine witnesses\nand informally interviewed many others who provided\ninformation about activities in and around Wheeler’s\napartment in the days leading up to the murders. According\nto these statements, Wheeler’s drug customers frequented his\napartment, disturbances were a regular occurrence, and\nshootings had occurred in the apartment. The police did not\nfind any corroborating physical or testimonial evidence\nsuggesting that any of these drug customers was the killer.\nWhen investigating Wheeler’s apartment, the police found\nfingerprints of individuals who had been seen in the\napartment on the evening the murders occurred, but nothing\nlinking them to the crime. The police arrested one drug\ndealer who worked with Wheeler, but ultimately released\nhim. When interrogated, this drug dealer denied murdering\nWheeler, but told the police that a Mexican Mafia member\nhad told him that the Mexican Mafia had murdered Wheeler.\nHe did not provide any corroborating evidence to support this\nstory.\n\n    Relying on this evidence, Andrews claims that his trial\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present\nevidence that third parties, such as Wheeler’s customers and\nfellow dealers, had the motive and opportunity to commit the\nmurders due to their drug-related dealings with Wheeler. The\nstate court summarily rejected this claim when it denied\nAndrews’s second state habeas petition. The district court\ndenied relief on this claim.\n\n    We conclude that reasonable jurists would not find\ndebatable or wrong the district court’s conclusion that this\nclaim fails under Strickland and AEDPA. See Slack,\n529 U.S. at 484. The evidence adduced at trial was\noverwhelming: Sanders, an eyewitness, testified to the events\n\f54                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nof the murders, Brooks testified regarding Andrews’s\nconfession, and the evidence established that Andrews’s palm\nprints were found on either side of Brandon’s body. In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 658. Accordingly, reasonable jurists\nwould not debate the reasonableness of the state court’s\nconclusion that counsel’s failure to further investigate these\nsuspects did not prejudice Andrews’s defense.              See\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     Second, Andrews argues that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence that semen found on\nBrandon’s body could not have come from Andrews. The\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the state court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in rejecting this claim is not\ndebatable, because the state court could reasonably conclude\nthat counsel’s failure to introduce such evidence was not\nprejudicial. The record shows only that slides containing\nsemen found on Brandon’s body contain biological markers\nthat some people secrete and others do not. Andrews does\nnot secrete these markers, but the record is silent as to\nwhether Brandon was a secretor. Andrews offers statistical\nevidence suggesting that Brandon was probably not a\nsecretor, but the evidence is not conclusive. Indeed, even\nother experts testifying for Andrews noted that what minimal\nevidence they obtained was subject to challenge. In light of\nthe eyewitness testimony about Andrews’s involvement in the\nmurders, and his palm prints next to Brandon’s body,\nreasonable jurists would not dispute that the state court\nreasonably concluded that any deficiency by defense counsel\nwas not prejudicial.\n\n    Next, Andrews raises two claims relating to the police\ninvestigation of fingerprint evidence found at Wheeler’s\napartment. As explained by the state court on direct appeal,\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        55\n\ntwo of the police’s fingerprint experts, Howard Sanshuck and\nDonald Keir, testified at trial that they compared 50\nfingerprints found in Wheeler’s apartment with Andrews’s\nfingerprints and palm prints. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at\n289. The two experts concluded that left and right palm\nprints on the kitchen floor on either side of Brandon’s body\nbelonged to Andrews. Id. Sanshuck’s supervisor, Jimmy\nCassel, had previously reviewed the prints and initially\nlabeled them as belonging to Wheeler. Id. Sanshuck\ndiscovered the error shortly before Andrews’s first trial. At\nthe second trial, Cassel stated that the original\nmisidentification was due to his efforts to process the crime\nscene information too quickly, and testified that there was no\nsimilarity between the palm prints found on the kitchen floor\nand Wheeler’s prints. Id. The three experts, Sanshuck, Keir,\nand Cassel, all testified at the second trial that Andrews’s\npalm prints matched the palm prints found on either side of\nBrandon’s body. Id. Andrews has never adduced any\nevidence to rebut this.\n\n    On appeal, Andrews claims that his counsel were\ndeficient in failing to investigate two different lines of\ndefense. First, Andrews claims that counsel performed\ndeficiently by failing to present evidence that Andrews’s\nfingerprints could have been left in Wheeler’s apartment due\nto his prior visits. Second, Andrews claims that counsel\nshould have uncovered and used the police’s original\nmisidentification of his palm prints. Andrews points to other\nreports in the record which he claims shows that Keir and a\nthird analyst, William Leo, also misidentified his fingerprints.\nThe district court rejected this claim. In light of the\nunrebutted evidence that the palm prints found on either side\nof Brandon’s body were Andrews’s prints, no reasonable\njurist would dispute the district court’s determination that the\n\f56                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nstate court could reasonably have concluded that counsel’s\nhandling of the fingerprint evidence did not prejudice\nAndrews’s defense. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     Finally, Andrews claims that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence regarding his alibi\nthe night of the murder. The record shows that Andrews gave\na defense investigator the names of two alibi witnesses and\ninformation on how to locate them, but Andrews did not\nprovide any affidavits from these witnesses to the state court,\nor any further information about the nature of their testimony.\nThe state court and district court rejected this claim. In light\nof the detailed testimony from Sanders and Brooks, the\nevidence of Andrews’s palm prints on either side of\nBrandon’s body, and the lack of any evidence regarding the\nalibi witnesses, no reasonable jurist would dispute that the\nstate court reasonably applied Strickland in concluding that\ncounsel’s failure to further investigate these witnesses was\nnot prejudicial.\n\n    Andrews relies on United States v. Valenzuela–Bernal for\nthe proposition that he could establish his ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim without showing how his alibi\nwitnesses would have testified, because he needed only show\ntheir testimony would be material and favorable to his\ndefense. 458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982). Therefore, Andrews\nclaims, the state court erred in rejecting his Strickland claim.\nThe district court rejected this argument, and we agree.\nValenzuela-Bernal held that when the government deports\naliens who could aid a criminal defendant in his defense,\nthere is no violation of the criminal defendant’s right to\ncompulsory process under the Sixth Amendment unless the\ndefendant “make[s] some plausible showing of how [the alibi\nwitness’s] testimony would have been both material and\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       57\n\nfavorable to his defense.” Id. This ruling does not “squarely\naddress[] the issue,” Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 125–26, or\n“establish a legal principle that clearly extends” to the\nquestion whether Andrews’s counsel’s failure to pursue the\nalibi witnesses was ineffective assistance of counsel, see\nMoses, 555 F.3d at 754 (quoting Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 123)\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim\nwas not an unreasonable application of Valenzuela-Bernal.\nSee Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07.\n\n    In sum, the state court did not unreasonably apply\nStrickland in concluding that Andrews did not create a\n“substantial, not just conceivable” likelihood of a different\nresult, or that “any real possibility of [Andrews’s] being\nacquitted was eclipsed by the remaining evidence pointing to\nguilt,” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112–13; see also Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695–96, and the district court’s determination to\nthis effect was not debatable. Accordingly, Andrews has not\nmade a “substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright,” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), and we decline to issue a\nCOA.\n\n                              C\n\n    Andrews argues that the state court erred in rejecting two\nclaims that his rights under Brady were violated. Brady\nrequires the state to disclose “evidence that is both favorable\nto the accused and material either to guilt or to punishment.”\nU.S. v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 674 (1985) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Evidence is material “if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Id. at 682. Thus, to establish a Brady violation, a\n\f58                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndefendant must prove: 1) “[t]he evidence at issue [is]\nfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\nbecause it is impeaching,” 2) the evidence was\n“suppressed . . . either willfully or inadvertently,” and\n3) prejudice resulted, meaning there is a reasonable\nprobability that disclosing the evidence to the defense would\nhave changed the result. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S.\n263, 281–82 (1999); Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.\n\n    Andrews claims the state suppressed two pieces of\nevidence. First, he contends that the prosecution failed to\ndisclose a case file maintained by the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment, termed a “murder book,” which contained\nmaterial evidence including the third party culpability and\nfingerprint evidence also advanced in support of his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims. The state court\ncould reasonably have rejected this claim because the state\nhad provided counsel with a chronology of the police\ninvestigation referring to much of the allegedly suppressed\nmurder book evidence. The district court held the state\ncourt’s conclusion was not an unreasonable application of\nBrady. No reasonable jurist could disagree with this\nconclusion, because the state court could reasonably have\nconcluded that the evidence was not suppressed under Brady.\nSee United States v. Dupuy, 760 F.2d 1492, 1501 n.5 (9th Cir.\n1985) (holding the government does not suppress evidence\nfor purposes of Brady where “the means of obtaining the\nexculpatory evidence [was] provided to the defense”).\nMoreover, the state court could have reasonably concluded\nthat the result of the proceeding would not have been\ndifferent even if the evidence had been disclosed to the\ndefense. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         59\n\n     For the same reason, no reasonable jurist could disagree\nwith the district court’s rejection of Andrews’s second Brady\nclaim, that the prosecution withheld the fact that Brooks was\nsubject to charges of welfare fraud. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that defense counsel had\nsufficient information to discover that charges had been filed,\nbecause defense counsel knew that Brooks was being\ninvestigated for welfare fraud, and questioned her about it at\ntrial, outside the presence of the jury. See Dupuy, 760 F.2d\nat 1501 n.5.\n\n    Andrews also raises claims under Napue, which provides\nthat the state may not “knowingly use false evidence,\nincluding false testimony” or “allow[] it to go uncorrected\nwhen it appears.” 360 U.S. at 269. According to Andrews,\nthe state knowingly adduced false testimony from two\nfingerprint experts, Keir and Sanshuck. First, Andrews notes\nthat a report in the record, dated August 4, 1980, states that\nKeir reviewed “fingers” from a suspect named “Walters” (the\nalias being used by Andrews at the time) and concludes that\nthe prints were “not made.” This means, Andrews argues,\nthat Keir lied in identifying the palm prints found by\nBrandon’s body as being from Andrews, and also lied when\nhe testified that he first examined Andrews’s palm prints in\nNovember 1983. The state asserts Keir did not testify falsely,\nbecause the report references fingerprints, while Keir testified\nregarding palm prints. Second, Andrews argues that\nSanshuck’s testimony that police policy did not require\nphotographs to be taken of prints on the surface from which\nthey were lifted was false, because it contradicted a Los\nAngeles Police Department Homicide Manual, dated 1981.19\n\n   19\n      The Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Manual states in\npertinent part:\n\f60                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nThe state argues that no false information was knowingly\npresented, see id., because the homicide manual used\npermissive, not mandatory, language, and because the\nmanual’s statement did not reflect the police department’s\nactual practice, which was the subject of Sanshuck’s\ntestimony. The district court rejected Andrews’s Napue\nclaims, and no reasonable jurist could disagree that the state\ncourt could reject these claims based on the reasonable view\nof the facts offered by the state. See Taylor v. Maddox,\n366 F.3d 992, 999–1000 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that under\nAEDPA, state court fact finding must be not merely wrong,\nbut “actually unreasonable” and without support in the record\nto warrant habeas relief).\n\n                                  D\n\n    Andrews makes three claims based on the fact that\nbetween 1993 and 1995, all biological evidence in this case\nwas destroyed, except for 50 fingerprint cards, one vaginal\nslide, one oral slide, and one anal slide. His petition to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court claimed that the destruction of the\nevidence violated his due process rights under Trombetta and\nArizona v. Youngblood, a case that held that the government’s\n“failure to preserve potentially useful evidence” before trial\ndoes not violate a defendant’s due process rights unless the\ncriminal defendant can show that the government acted in bad\nfaith. 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988). As Andrews acknowledges,\n\n\n       Note: (A) Photographing Prints\n\n       Prints found at the scene of a homicide should be\n       photographed. The procedure is recommended because\n       it is much easier to introduce print evidence into court\n       if the print has been photographed, as parts of the object\n       which carried the print may show in the picture.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        61\n\nthe Supreme Court has since held that cases assessing pre-\nconviction access to evidence, which would include\nTrombetta and Youngblood, do not apply to cases where a\ndefendant is denied access to evidence after being convicted.\nSee Dist. Attorney’s Office for the Third Judicial District v.\nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 61–62, 68–69, 74 (2009); see also\nCress v. Palmer, 484 F.3d 844, 853 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(observing that “the Supreme Court has not clearly\nestablished that post-conviction destruction [of evidence] is\na due process violation”). Therefore, the California Supreme\nCourt did not unreasonably apply Trombetta or Youngblood.\nAndrews relies on Osborne to make a second claim, that the\ndestruction of evidence violated his due process and Eighth\nAmendment rights. We do not consider whether the state\ncourt’s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Osborne, because it was decided after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court ruled, and thus is not clearly\nestablished precedent for purposes of § 2254(d)(1). This\ntheory was not briefed to the district court, as the case was\ndecided between completion of briefing and the court’s\ndecision. Andrews points to no clearly established precedent\nin existence at the time the state court ruled that applies this\nprinciple, and therefore the district court’s rejection of this\nclaim was not debatable among fair minded jurists.\n\n    Andrews’s third claim is that the destruction of evidence\ndenied him access to the courts to vindicate an underlying\nclaim of factual innocence. However, as the district court\nrecognized in rejecting this claim, he cites no Supreme Court\nprecedent clearly establishing that destruction of evidence\nafter a defendant is convicted violates a right of access to the\ncourts. Christopher v. Harbury, on which Andrews relies, is\nnot on point: it held that a plaintiff’s claim that government\nofficials misled her in connection with her husband’s\n\f62                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndisappearance did not state a constitutional denial of access\nclaim upon which relief could be granted. 536 U.S. 403, 407,\n415, 418–19 (2002). Accordingly, no reasonable jurist could\ndispute that the district court correctly denied this claim.\n\n                               E\n\n    In light of the above, we conclude that no reasonable\njurist would disagree with the district court in rejecting\nAndrews’s cumulative error claim. “[T]he fundamental\nquestion in determining whether the combined effect of trial\nerrors violated a defendant’s due process rights is whether the\nerrors rendered the criminal defense ‘far less persuasive,’ and\nthereby had a ‘substantial and injurious effect or influence’\non the jury’s verdict.” Parle v. Runnels, 505 F.3d 922, 928\n(9th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted) (quoting Chambers v.\nMississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 294 (1973) and Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993)). We agree with the\ndistrict court that the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined that any errors, in the aggregate, did not have\nsuch a substantial or injurious effect on the verdict. The\ncumulative result of the disputable errors identified by\nAndrews would not have made his defense significantly more\npersuasive, since his defense focused on attacking the\ncredibility of Sanders and Brooks and challenging the\nfingerprint and palm print evidence. Reasonable jurists\nwould not dispute the district court’s conclusion, so no COA\nis warranted.\n\n    Nor would any reasonable jurist disagree with the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the state court did not err in rejecting\nAndrews’s factual innocence claim. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that Andrews’s introduction of\nslides showing that biological markers found in the semen on\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             63\n\nBrandon’s body had not been secreted by Andrews and may\nnot have been secreted by Brandon, described above, was\ninsufficient to “go beyond demonstrating doubt about his\nguilt [to] affirmatively prove that he is probably innocent.”\nSee Carriger v. Stewart, 132 F.3d 463, 476 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(en banc) (observing that the standard for establishing a\nfreestanding claim of actual innocence is “‘extraordinarily\nhigh,’ and that the showing [for a successful claim] would\nhave to be ‘truly persuasive.’” (quoting Herrera, 506 U.S. at\n417) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). This claim does not merit\na COA.\n\n    In sum, because the district court’s conclusions, under\nAEDPA review, are not debatable among reasonable jurists,\nAndrews fails to make the “substantial showing of the denial\nof a constitutional right” required for a COA to issue, and we\ndeny his request for one as to each of his uncertified claims.\n\n                                  V\n\n    Andrews contends that the district court erred in denying\nhis motion for an evidentiary hearing on 16 claims (Claims\n1–8, 15, 19–23, 25, and 32), which include all but one of the\nclaims on appeal here.20 We review a district court’s denial\nof an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion, Sully v.\nAyers, 725 F.3d 1057, 1067 (9th Cir. 2013), and “may affirm\nthe district court’s decision on any ground supported by the\nrecord, even if it differs from the district court’s rationale,”\nid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In Pinholster, the\nSupreme Court stated that “review under § 2254(d)(1) is\n\n\n 20\n    He did not seek an evidentiary hearing on Claim 26, which raised the\nargument that it would violate the Eighth Amendment to execute him after\na long delay.\n\f64                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.” 131 S. Ct. at 1398.\n“[A]n evidentiary hearing is pointless once the district court\nhas determined that § 2254(d) precludes habeas relief.” Sully,\n725 F.3d at 1075; see Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1411 n.20\n(“Because Pinholster has failed to demonstrate that the\nadjudication of his claim based on the state-court record\nresulted in a decision ‘contrary to’ or ‘involv[ing] an\nunreasonable application’ of federal law, a writ of habeas\ncorpus ‘shall not be granted’ and our analysis is at an end.”\n(alteration in original)). Accordingly, the district court did\nnot err in denying Andrews’s motion for an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n    In light of the foregoing, we REVERSE the district\ncourt’s grant of relief, DISMISS the Eighth Amendment\nlethal injection claim as unripe, and DENY the petition for a\nCOA of the uncertified claims.\n\n  REVERSED in part, DISMISSED in part, and\nPETITION DENIED in part.\n\f",

People v. Andrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1168192\"><a href=\"/opinion/1168192/people-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (Cal.\n1989). The murder victims were Preston Wheeler, who lived\nin the apartment, Patrice Brandon, and Ronald Chism. Id.\nThe California Supreme Court described the murder scene as\nfollows:\n\n       Wheeler had been stabbed in the chest six\n       times and shot in the neck at close range with\n       either a .32– or .357– caliber weapon. His\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       5\n\n       face and head were bruised, and his face had\n       been slashed with a knife. Brandon and\n       Chism had been strangled with wire coat\n       hangers. Their faces were bruised, Chism’s\n       extensively. Brandon’s anus was extremely\n       dilated, bruised, reddened and torn, consistent\n       with the insertion of a penis shortly before her\n       death. There was also redness around the\n       opening of her vagina, and vaginal samples\n       revealed the presence of semen and\n       spermatozoa. All three victims were bound\n       hand and foot.\n\nId.\n\n    Approximately a year later, police arrested Charles\nSanders in connection with the murders. Id. Sanders entered\ninto a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to three\ncounts of second degree murder, admitted a gun\nenhancement, and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution,\nin exchange for a sentence of 17 years to life in prison. Id.\nDuring his interrogation by the police, Sanders gave both a\ntape-recorded and a written statement. Id. He also testified\nat Andrews’s trial, and described the crime as follows:\n\n       Sanders testified that he and [Andrews]\n       devised a plan to rob Wheeler, a drug dealer.\n       [Andrews] armed himself with a .357\n       magnum and gave Sanders a .38–or\n       .32–caliber automatic. On the evening of the\n       murders, they visited their friend, Carol\n       Brooks, who lived in the same apartment\n       building as Wheeler, and then went to\n       Wheeler’s apartment. In response to their\n\f6                ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    knocking, Wheeler, who apparently knew\n    [Andrews], let them in. Also inside the\n    apartment was a woman (Patrice Brandon).\n    After smoking some marijuana with Wheeler,\n    [Andrews] and Sanders drew their guns.\n    Sanders tied Wheeler and Brandon with belts\n    and socks, put on a pair of gloves, and began\n    to search the apartment for drugs and money.\n    Except for some powder on a saucer which\n    appeared to be cocaine, the search was\n    unsuccessful. [Andrews] questioned Wheeler,\n    who denied having any drugs or money.\n    Saying he would make Brandon talk,\n    [Andrews] dragged her into the kitchen and\n    closed the door. Sanders remained in the\n    living room with Wheeler.\n\n    Sanders heard [Andrews] hitting Brandon and\n    later heard sounds as though they were having\n    sex. When [Andrews] came out of the kitchen\n    shortly thereafter, Sanders saw Brandon’s\n    pants around her ankles.\n\n    [Andrews] put his gun in Wheeler’s mouth.\n    He threatened to kill Wheeler and Brandon\n    unless Wheeler revealed the location of the\n    drugs. Wheeler said the ‘dope’ was in the\n    attic, and pointed out a trap door leading up to\n    it. Sanders climbed into the attic. While in\n    the attic, Sanders heard two shots. When he\n    came down, [Andrews] told him he had shot\n    Wheeler because the latter had tried to jump\n    out the window. Sanders asked if Wheeler\n    was dead. [Andrews] responded he was\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        7\n\n       ‘standing right up’ on Wheeler when he fired\n       the gun . . . . When Sanders asked about\n       Brandon, [Andrews] replied he had killed her\n       before leaving the kitchen.\n\n       While [Andrews] and Sanders were cleaning\n       up the apartment, Ronald Chism knocked on\n       the door and asked if everything was all right.\n       [Andrews] said Wheeler was home and\n       invited him inside. [Andrews] then hit Chism\n       on the head, tied him up, and took him into\n       the bathroom. Sanders saw [Andrews] sitting\n       astride Chism’s back, joining and separating\n       his clenched fists in a tugging motion,\n       apparently strangling Chism. Sanders then\n       saw [Andrews] go into the kitchen and choke\n       Brandon with a wire clothes hanger. When\n       the two left the apartment, [Andrews] gave\n       Sanders some money, saying it was all he had\n       found.\n\nIn re Andrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519733\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519733/in-re-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 (Cal. 2002) (alterations,\ncitations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nwas eventually arrested, and he was charged in June 1982.\n\n    At trial, the jury heard Sanders’s testimony as well as the\ntestimony of Carol Brooks. Brooks confirmed that Andrews\nand Sanders visited her on the night of the murders and told\nher about their plan to “get some money” from Wheeler.\nPeople v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at 289. A week after the\nincident, Sanders told her about his involvement in the\nmurders. Id. Then, a few weeks later, Andrews confessed to\nher that he shot Wheeler, had sex with Brandon, and took\n$300 during the robbery. Id.\n\f8                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    The prosecution also presented fingerprint evidence. Id.\nPolice experts analyzed 50 prints lifted from the apartment;\nthree prints belonged to Andrews. Id. One fingerprint was\nfound on a coffee table in Wheeler’s living room. Id. Two\npalm prints were found on the kitchen floor, on either side of\nthe spot where Brandon’s body was found, the left palm print\nbeing about a foot from her body.\n\n    The defense primarily focused on undermining Sanders’s\ncredibility. Id. Two jail inmates who had been incarcerated\nwith Sanders testified. Id. They stated that, while Sanders\nwas incarcerated with them, he made statements suggesting\nhe planned to lie about the murders to shift blame onto\nAndrews and away from himself. Id.\n\n    The jury deliberated for three days before finding\nAndrews guilty of murder.1 The jury also found three special\ncircumstances to be true. Two special circumstances related\nto the offense conduct: (1) multiple murder and robbery\nmurder, based on the murders of Wheeler, Brandon, and\nChism, and the robbery of Wheeler, and 2) rape-murder,\nbased on the rape and murder of Brandon. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 659. The third special circumstance was\nAndrews’s conviction for murder of a grocery store clerk in\n1967. Id.\n\n    Both the prosecutor and defense counsel made brief\npresentations at the penalty phase. The prosecutor presented\nevidence through a joint stipulation. Id. He noted that the\njury had already found that Andrews had been convicted of\nmurder in 1967. The parties also stipulated that Andrews had\n\n  1\n    Andrews was convicted after his second trial, because the jury failed\nto reach a verdict in the first trial.\n\f                     ANDREWS V.

The stipulation\ndid not describe the facts of the offenses underlying these\nadditional convictions. The prosecution also submitted\nphotographs of the dead bodies of Patrice Brandon and\nRonald Chism as they were found by the police in the\napartment; the photos had been excluded at the guilt phase on\nthe ground they were unduly inflammatory. Id. Finally, the\nparties stipulated that Andrews’s birth date was July 2, 1950.\nId.\n\n    The defense evidence consisted of two sworn statements\nthat were read to the jury. Id. The statements described facts\nunderlying the incident in September 1966 that formed the\nbasis of Andrews’s 1967 conviction for murder. According\nto the statements, Andrews and a 17-year-old companion,\nboth of whom were armed, attempted to rob a grocery store,\nand the companion fired three shots, killing the grocery store\nclerk. Id.\n\n    In his closing argument, defense counsel focused on\nmitigating circumstances. He argued that Andrews’s crimes\nwere unsophisticated, occurred several years apart, and all\ninvolved the unexpected escalation of a planned robbery. Id.\nHe pointed out that Andrews was only 15 years old at the\ntime of the murder of the grocery store clerk, and was not the\nshooter. Id. He portrayed Andrews’s conduct as less\nblameworthy because the murders occurred while Andrews,\nSanders, Wheeler, and Brandon were under the influence of\nillegal drugs. Id. at 659–60. Finally, he emphasized that\nother murderers had received life without the possibility of\nparole despite the jury’s finding of special circumstances, and\ndespite more blameworthy conduct. Id. at 659. He pointed\n\f10                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nout that in this very case, Sanders received a sentence of only\n17 years to life. Id. at 660. The prosecution made no\nrebuttal.\n\n    After one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict\nimposing the death penalty for each of the three murder\ncounts. The court sentenced Andrews to death on the three\ncounts on June 8, 1984. The California Supreme Court\naffirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal on\nAugust 3, 1989. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at 285, 288.\n\n                              B\n\n    Andrews filed petitions for state post-conviction relief,\nclaiming, among other things, that his counsel’s assistance\nwas ineffective at the penalty phase because counsel did not\nadequately investigate and present mitigating evidence. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denied all of Andrews’s\nclaims, except for his penalty phase ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.\n\n    The California Supreme Court appointed a referee to take\nevidence and make factual findings on six questions related\nto Andrews’s penalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659. Two of the six\nquestions are relevant to the question of whether Andrews\nwas prejudiced by his counsel’s allegedly ineffective\nassistance: “1. What mitigating character and background\nevidence could have been, but was not, presented by\n[Andrews]’s trial attorneys at his penalty trial?” id. at 660,\nand “5. What evidence, damaging to [Andrews], but not\npresented by the prosecution at the guilt or penalty trials,\nwould likely have been presented in rebuttal, if [Andrews]\nhad introduced any such mitigating character and background\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              11\n\nevidence?” id. at 664.2 The referee received the testimony of\nover 50 witnesses, which took place over the span of six\nyears, id. at 660, and issued a lengthy written report of her\nfindings.\n\n    The California Supreme Court denied Andrews’s penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a lengthy\nopinion. Id. at 656–76. In its opinion, the court summarized\nthe referee’s findings. In response to the first question, the\nreferee identified three broad categories of mitigating\nevidence that were available but not presented to the jury:\nAndrews’s family background; the conditions of his\nconfinement in a juvenile reform school and in the Alabama\nprison system; and his mental health. Id. at 660. As\nsummarized in the court’s opinion, the referee’s report\nincluded the following information regarding Andrews’s\n\n 2\n     The other four questions were:\n\n          2. What investigative steps by trial counsel, if any,\n          would have led to each such item of information?\n\n          3. What investigative steps, if any, did trial counsel take\n          in an effort to gather mitigating evidence to be\n          presented at the penalty phase?\n\n          4. What tactical or financial constraints, if any, weighed\n          against the investigation or presentation of mitigating\n          character and background evidence at the penalty\n          phase? . . .\n\n          6. Did [Andrews] himself request that either the\n          investigation or the presentation of mitigating evidence\n          at the penalty phase be curtailed in any manner? If so,\n          what specifically did [Andrews] request?\n\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659.\n\f12                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nbackground. When he was very young, Andrews’s alcoholic\nparents separated, and his mother left him to be raised by his\ngrandparents and aunt, in a large family home with his\nsiblings and cousins, located in a poor, segregated\nneighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. Id. The referee described\nAndrews’s grandfather as “loving, benevolent, and\nresponsible,” id., and the court added that Andrews’s mother\nregularly sent money and clothing to her children and that\nAndrews’s upbringing and early family life were “relatively\nstable and without serious privation or abuse,” id. at 670.\nWhen Andrews was around nine or ten, his mother returned\nhome to stay. Id. at 660, 670. She had children by another\nmarriage, of whom Andrews was jealous. Id. at 660. Around\nthat time Andrews’s grandfather, a “pivotal figure” in his life,\ndied. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nbecame withdrawn, skipped school, and at age 14, committed\ncar theft and was sent to a reform school known as Mt.\nMeigs, formally the Alabama Industrial School for Negro\nChildren. Id.\n\n    The conditions at Mt. Meigs, described succinctly by the\nstate court as “appalling,” included “beatings, brutality,\ninadequate conditions and sexual predators.” Id. at 660–61\n(internal quotation marks omitted). According to the\nreferee’s report, one witness described it as “a farming\noperation and a penal colony for children,” while others\ndescribed “inhuman conditions, inadequate food and clothing\nand severe beatings,” with “sticks, broom handles, tree limbs,\nand hoe handles . . . or fan belts.” Andrews was released at\nage 16. Id. at 661.\n\n   Within three months of his release, in September 1966, he\nand a companion were involved in the attempted robbery and\nmurder of the grocery store clerk that became one of the three\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       13\n\nspecial circumstances in this capital case. See supra at 9; In\nre Andrews, 52 P.3d at 661. The evidence showed that when\nAndrews and his companion were fleeing the scene in a taxi,\nthey robbed the taxi driver at gunpoint. In re Andrews, 52\nP.3d at 661. The taxi driver testified he heard Andrews say\n“[l]et’s shoot him.” Id. at 665 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Andrews then fired at least two shots at the taxi\ndriver. Id. In 1967, Andrews was convicted of murder based\non the grocery store incident, and in 1968, he was convicted\nof armed robbery of the taxi driver. Id. at 661 n.4. Just\nbefore he turned 18, he was committed to Alabama state\nprison. Id. at 661.\n\n    Summarizing the referee’s findings about conditions in\nthe four different prisons in which Andrews was confined\nover ten years, the California Supreme Court stated:\n\n       [The referee] described conditions in these\n       institutions as abysmal, characterized by\n       severe overcrowding, racial segregation,\n       substandard facilities, no separation of the\n       tougher inmates from younger or smaller\n       inmates, constant violence, the persistent\n       threat of sexual assaults and the constant\n       presence of sexual pressure, the availability\n       and necessity of weapons by all inmates, and\n       degrading conditions in disciplinary modules.\n       [Andrews] not only received beatings but was\n       also personally subjected to sexual assaults.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    The court also noted that Andrews had been involved in\nprison violence, including “the stabbings of two inmates who\n\f14                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nhad been threatening him.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). However, Andrews “was rarely the instigator of\nviolence,” was “the prey rather than the predator” when he\nwas involved, and was often a target of violence due to his\nsmall stature. Id. at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHe also “appeared to adjust well when the structure permitted\nand . . . would continue to do so” and, “when circumstances\npermitted, he tended to hold positions of responsibility.” Id.\n\n    After his release from prison in 1976, Andrews engaged\nin an attempted robbery of a laundry. Id. at 661. In this\nincident:\n\n       Mobile Police Officer Pettis testified that on\n       March 23, 1977, he responded to a robbery\n       call. Entering the store from which the call\n       came, he and other officers saw [Andrews]\n       holding a crying young woman hostage with\n       a cocked gun at her head. He told the officers\n       to leave and “continued to repeat, ‘Someone’s\n       going to get shot, I’m going to shoot.’” The\n       officers withdrew. Ultimately, [Andrews]\n       surrendered to the officers after releasing the\n       young woman and another woman whom he\n       had also held hostage.\n\nId. at 665. Andrews was arrested for the robbery, but escaped\nfrom jail and fled to California. Id. at 661.\n\n    In California, Andrews met Debra Pickett, with whom he\nhad a stable relationship. Id. The couple had a child, and\nAndrews held a job during this time. Id. But Andrews\nresumed using cocaine, left his job and family, and then\ncommitted the three murders at issue here. Id.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             15\n\n    The referee also described the testimony from mental\nhealth experts that could have been presented at the penalty\nphase. Summarizing the referee’s report, the California\nSupreme Court noted that the experts diagnosed Andrews\nwith a range of mental disorders, including attention deficit\ndisorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and mild to\nmoderate organic brain impairment, in part due to drug use\nand possibly due to a head injury in prison. Id. The experts\nopined that Andrews’s learning disability, the adverse\ncircumstances of his childhood, the impact of the correctional\nsystems, and the PTSD made his commission of the murders\nand sexual assault more understandable and less morally\nculpable. Id. at 661–62. The experts gave specific examples\nof how Andrews’s impairments and the brutal conditions of\nincarceration made it difficult for him to avoid getting into\ntrouble with the law. Id. at 661–62, 670. For example, one\npsychiatrist testified that one of the victims had hurled an\ninsulting slur at Andrews a few days before the murders, and\nAndrews’s PTSD would predispose him to overreact to the\nslur, which contributed to the expert’s conclusion that\nAndrews was “under the influence of extreme mental or\nemotional distress” when he committed the murders.\n\n    In addressing the question whether the prosecutor would\nhave introduced evidence damaging to Andrews in rebuttal,\nthe referee found that the prosecution’s rebuttal presentation\ncould have included evidence about two of Andrews’s prior\nconvictions.3 Id. at 664–65. First, during the penalty phase\n\n\n\n 3\n   Andrews argued that the prosecutor testified he would not have put on\nadditional evidence, but the California Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, finding that presentation of the mitigating evidence would have\nprompted the prosecutor to shift the focus of his penalty phase case, put\n\f16                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nof Andrews’s trial, the jury was reminded of its special\ncircumstance finding, that Andrews had been convicted of\nmurder in 1967 for his involvement in the grocery store\nrobbery-murder in 1966. It also heard that Andrews was\nconvicted of robbery in 1968, but it did not hear the facts on\nwhich the conviction was based, such as evidence that\nAndrews shot at the driver of the get-away taxi, which could\nhave been introduced as aggravating evidence. Id. at 659,\n664. The prosecution could have introduced that evidence to\nshow Andrews’s greater moral culpability for the incident.\nId. at 664. Second, the prosecution could have informed the\njury about Andrews’s attempt to rob a laundry business\nfollowing his release from prison in 1976, which involved\nholding two women hostage, one with a gun to her head. Id.\nat 661, 665.\n\n    Further, the referee determined that the prosecution could\nhave called its own mental health experts to rebut Andrews’s\nevidence. Id. at 665. The state could have presented expert\ntestimony that Andrews did not suffer from PTSD, but rather\nsuffered from antisocial personality disorder, resented\nauthority, and had a normal-range IQ of 93. Id. A second\nexpert would have testified that Andrews’s ability to hold a\njob and maintain a stable relationship with Debra Pickett\nbefore he committed the murders indicated he did not suffer\nfrom brain damage, and the planning and thought that went\ninto the murders made it unlikely that he was under the\ninfluence of drugs at the time. Id.\n\n    After recounting the referee’s findings on these questions\nas well as the other four questions, and resolving objections\n\n\non additional witnesses, and use cross-examination and closing argument\nto further damage Andrews’s mitigation case. Id. at 665–66.\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       17\n\nto the referee’s report, the California Supreme Court turned\nto its analysis of Andrews’s ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim. Id. at 667. It held that Andrews’s counsel’s\nperformance was not deficient during the penalty phase of the\ntrial because Andrews’s counsel made a reasonable\ninvestigation, under then-existing professional norms and\nSupreme Court precedent, and counsel also made a\nreasonable decision not to conduct additional investigation.\nId. 667–71. It then held that even if counsel’s performance\nwere deficient, Andrews suffered no prejudice because a\ndifferent result was not reasonably probable in light of the\nseverity of his crimes, the fact that the jury might view some\nof his mitigating evidence as aggravating, and the substantial\nrebuttal evidence that could have been presented. Id. at 671.\n\n    Andrews filed a habeas petition in federal district court.\nHis amended petition raised 32 claims, including multiple\nsubclaims. In a lengthy ruling on the merits of the petition,\nthe district court denied 31 claims, but granted relief on the\nclaim that Andrews’s counsel were ineffective at the penalty\nphase of his trial for failing to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence. Reviewing the evidence\nproduced by the referee on this issue, the district court\nconcluded that counsel had made “essentially no effort to\ninvestigate and put on evidence in mitigation,” which\nconstituted deficient performance under Strickland. The\ncourt then ruled that counsel’s “failure to adequately\ninvestigate and discover evidence of a life filled with abuse\nand privation is sufficient to establish prejudice under\nStrickland,” but the court did not consider whether the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s rejection of this ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim was “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of” Strickland under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1). The court granted Andrews’s petition on this\n\f18                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, denied Andrews’s\nother 31 claims, and granted a certificate of appealability\n(COA) on Andrews’s claim that California’s lethal injection\nprotocol violates the Eighth Amendment (Claim 25).\n\n    Andrews timely appealed, challenging the district court’s\ndenial of Claim 25 and the denials of several uncertified\nclaims. The state cross-appealed the district court’s grant of\nrelief on Andrews’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nAfter briefing on his appeal was complete, Andrews moved\nfor permission to brief an additional uncertified claim, in\nwhich he seeks habeas relief on the ground that it would\nviolate the Eighth Amendment to execute him after a long\ndelay from the date of his sentencing. We granted the\nmotion.\n\n                              II\n\n    We review a district court’s grant or denial of habeas\nrelief de novo. Moses v.

DAVIS                        21\n\n    The Supreme Court has made clear that § 2254(d) sets\nforth a “highly deferential standard[,] . . . which demands that\nstate-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.”\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “As amended by AEDPA, § 2254(d) stops short of\nimposing a complete bar on federal-court relitigation of\nclaims already rejected in state proceedings,” but only\n“preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there is\nno possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state\ncourt’s decision conflicts with this Court’s precedents” and\n“goes no further.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 102. “[E]ven a strong\ncase for relief does not mean the state court’s contrary\nconclusion was unreasonable.” Id. In a nutshell, “[i]f this\nstandard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to\nbe.” Id. at 102.\n\n                               B\n\n     The clearly established federal law for ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt, is Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), and\nits progeny. See Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1403. Strickland\nconcluded that, under the Sixth Amendment, the accused has\nthe right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial and\nduring capital sentencing proceedings. 466 U.S. at 684–87.\nA petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must\nprove: (1) that “counsel’s performance was deficient,” and\n(2) that “the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.”\nId. at 687. “[A] court need not determine whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient before examining the prejudice\nsuffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged\ndeficiencies.” Id. at 697. Rather, “[i]f it is easier to dispose\nof an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient\nprejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course\n\f22                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nshould be followed.” Id. In short, a court need not address\nthe two Strickland prongs in order; if ruling on the prejudice\nprong more efficiently resolves the case, reaching the\ndeficiency prong is unnecessary. Id.\n\n    In determining whether a state court’s adjudication of an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent, we may consider\nhow the Supreme Court itself has applied Strickland to other\nfactual contexts, but this is merely “illustrative of the proper\napplication of [Strickland’s] standards.” See Wiggins v.\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (2003); see also Pinholster, 131 S.\nCt. at 1407 n.17; Brian R. Means, Federal Habeas Manual\n§ 3:29 (2014). The Supreme Court has warned us not to\nderive “strict rules” from its cases applying Strickland de\nnovo because “the Strickland test ‘of necessity requires a\ncase-by-case examination of the evidence.’” Pinholster, 131\nS.Ct. at 1407 & n.17 (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 391).\nFurther, Supreme Court cases decided on de novo review\n“offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has\nunreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking” or defense\ncounsel was deficient, and so are not directly applicable to a\nfederal court’s review under § 2254(d)(1) of a habeas\npetitioner’s claim that a state court unreasonably applied\nStrickland. Id. at 1411. Indeed, a state court’s application of\nStrickland may be objectively reasonable based on clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent at the time of its\ndecision even if the Supreme Court’s subsequent applications\nof Strickland suggest a different result. By contrast, when the\nSupreme Court addresses the AEDPA question whether a\nstate court’s adjudication of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland,\nits reasoning guides a federal court’s AEDPA analysis\nregardless of when the opinion was issued.\n\f                     ANDREWS V.

To make this\nprejudice determination, a court generally proceeds through\nthree steps: (1) evaluating and weighing the totality of the\navailable mitigation evidence, see Williams, 529 U.S. at\n397–98; Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1408–10; (2) evaluating and\nweighing the aggravating evidence and any rebuttal evidence\nthat could have been adduced by the government had the\nmitigating evidence been introduced, Williams, 529 U.S. at\n397–98; Pinholster, 131 S.Ct. at 1408–10, and (3) reweighing\nthe evidence in aggravation against the totality of available\nmitigating evidence, see Sears v.

The\nSupreme Court has identified several non-exclusive\ncategories of mitigation evidence, focusing primarily on\nevidence that aids the jury’s evaluation of a defendant’s\nmoral culpability.

Thus, a defendant who had a\nchildhood “filled with abuse and privation,” including being\nraised by parents who were eventually imprisoned for\ncriminal child neglect, could influence a jury’s appraisal of\nthe defendant’s moral culpability. Williams, 529 U.S at 395,\n398; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535 (mitigating evidence\nincluded evidence that the defendant suffered severe privation\nand abuse as a child, had an alcoholic and absent mother, was\nphysically and sexually abused in foster care, and was\nhomeless for a brief period); Rompilla v.

DAVIS                        25\n\nPenry, 492 U.S. at 319. For instance, evidence that a\ndefendant is “borderline mentally retarded,” Williams,\n529 U.S. at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted), or has\nsevere PTSD from military combat, see Porter v. McCollum,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35–36 & n.4, 43–44 (2009), or has severe\nlearning and behavioral disabilities, frontal lobe injuries, and\nbrain damage from drug and alcohol abuse, see Sears,\n561 U.S. at 948–49, is potentially mitigating evidence.\n\n    Evidence of conduct or behavior demonstrating the\ndefendant’s good character may also be mitigating. In\nWilliams, the Court gave weight to evidence that the\ndefendant had turned himself in, alerted police to a previously\nundetected crime, expressed remorse, cooperated with police,\nand behaved well in prison. 529 U.S. at 369, 396, 398. In\nBelmontes, the Court noted mitigation evidence that the\ndefendant had maintained strong relationships with family\nmembers in spite of his terrible childhood, and that while in\nprison, he assisted others through a prison religious program\nand rose to second in command in a fire crew. 558 U.S. at\n21.\n\n    After identifying the evidence that the petitioner claims to\nbe mitigating, a court must weigh its strength by assessing its\nlikely impact on a jury. This weighing process includes\nevaluating whether its impact on the jury might be\naggravating rather than mitigating. See Pinholster, 131 S. Ct.\nat 1410. The Supreme Court has indicated that courts can\nconsider the fact that mitigation “may be in the eye of the\nbeholder,” and juries may find that some evidence offered as\nmitigation cuts the other way. Burger v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n794 (1987) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn Burger, the Court noted that “[o]n one hand, a jury could\nreact with sympathy over the tragic childhood” of the\n\f26                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndefendant, while on the other hand, the same testimony could\nestablish the defendant’s “unpredictable propensity for\nviolence” that resulted in murder. Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Similarly, evidence of mental and emotional\nproblems might suggest an increased likelihood that a\ndefendant would be dangerous in the future. See Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1410 (noting that evidence of the defendant’s\nfamily background, their substance abuse, and their mental\nhealth issues, was “by no means clearly mitigating, as the jury\nmight have concluded that [the defendant] was simply beyond\nrehabilitation”). The Court has also observed that evidence\nof the defendant’s normal youth might, in the jury’s eyes,\nestablish greater moral culpability on the part of the\ndefendant. See Bell v. Cone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118509\"><a href=\"/opinion/118509/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 701–02 (2002).\n\n                              2\n\n    The second step in determining whether counsel’s\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty\nphase is evaluating the weight of the aggravating evidence\nand any rebuttal evidence that could have been adduced by\nthe government had the mitigating evidence been introduced.\nSee Williams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at\n1408–10. Aggravating evidence may include evidence\nrelating to the circumstances of the crime. Thus in\nStrickland, the Court found the aggravating evidence to be\n“overwhelming” where the defendant had repeatedly stabbed\nthe three murder victims during a robbery. 466 U.S. at 674,\n700. Similarly, where the record showed that the defendant\nhad bludgeoned a woman to death with 15 to 20 blows of a\nsteel dumbbell bar to steal goods worth a mere $100, the\nSupreme Court agreed with the state court that the\naggravating evidence was “simply overwhelming” and\ndetermined that counsel’s failure to introduce certain\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       27\n\nmitigating evidence was not prejudicial. Belmontes, 558 U.S.\nat 15–16, 26–27 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Bobby\nv. Van Hook, the Supreme Court gave weight to evidence that\nthe murder was committed in the course of a scheme to rob\nhomosexual men by luring them into secluded settings.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12–13 (2009) (per curiam). In doing so, the\nCourt clarified that the weight, not the number, of the\naggravating factors was important. Id.\n\n    Evidence about a defendant’s prior criminal history is also\naggravating and can be introduced in rebuttal, and a severe\ncriminal history carries great weight. See Woodford v.\nVisciotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122243\"><a href=\"/opinion/122243/woodford-v-visciotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26–27 (2002) (criminal history that\nincluded “the knifing of one man, and the stabbing of a\npregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her unborn\nbaby,” combined with the circumstances of the crime, was\n“overwhelming” and “devastating” aggravating evidence);\naccord Bell, 535 U.S. at 700 & n.5 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would elicit information\nabout defendant’s criminal history, which included robberies,\nin rebuttal); Burger, 483 U.S. at 793 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would introduce the\ndefendant’s juvenile criminal history in rebuttal, when he had\na clean adult record). Evidence that a defendant had\npreviously committed another murder may be “the most\npowerful imaginable aggravating evidence.” Belmontes,\n558 U.S. at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Rebuttal evidence may also directly undermine the value\nof the mitigation evidence. For example, the Supreme Court\nnoted in Pinholster that it would be “of questionable\nmitigating value” for defense counsel to introduce expert\ntestimony diagnosing a defendant with bipolar mood disorder\nand seizure disorders, because such evidence would invite\n\f28                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nrebuttal by a state expert, who could reject the diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder and offer a different diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1396, 1410.\n\n                               3\n\n    Finally, the third step in determining whether counsel’s\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty\nphase is to “reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the\ntotality of available mitigating evidence,” Wiggins, 539 U.S.\nat 534, in order to determine “whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would\nhave concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n695. A “reasonable probability” is a level of probability that\n“undermine[s] confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694.\nHowever, counsel’s deficient performance is not prejudicial\nmerely because the court cannot “rule out” the possibility\nthat the sentencer would have imposed a sentence of life in\nprison instead of the death penalty. Belmontes, 558 U.S. at\n20, 27 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Richter,\n562 U.S. at 111 (“In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the\nquestion is not whether a court can be certain counsel’s\nperformance had no effect on the outcome . . . .”). Rather,\n“[t]he likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not\njust conceivable.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112 (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693). Thus, “the difference between Strickland’s\nprejudice standard and a more-probable-than-not standard is\nslight and matters ‘only in the rarest case.’” Id. (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 697).\n\n    The Court has found a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome when only scant and weak aggravating\nevidence could have been presented in rebuttal to strongly\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       29\n\nmitigating evidence. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534–36,\n537–38 (holding that there was a reasonable probability that\nthe jury would have reached a different result at sentencing\nhad it heard powerful mitigating evidence regarding the\ndefendant’s childhood background, when the state could have\npresented only weak rebuttal evidence). By contrast, the\nCourt has found no prejudice when the aggravating evidence\nis overwhelming, even though the mitigating evidence is\nstrong. See Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 26–27 (holding that there\nwas no reasonable probability of a different result when the\nmitigating evidence, including the defendant’s “troubled\nfamily background” and possible seizure disorder, did not\noutweigh the “overwhelming” aggravating factors, including\nthe circumstances of the crime and potential rebuttal evidence\nof prior offenses).\n\n    In reweighing aggravating and mitigating evidence, the\nCourt has also examined whether mitigating evidence would\nbe merely cumulative or would have significantly altered the\ninformation provided to the sentencer. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 699–700; Porter, 558 U.S. at 41–42. In\nStrickland, the new information “would barely have altered”\nthe picture presented at sentencing, and the Court found no\nprejudice. 466 U.S. at 699–700. Similarly, in Belmontes, the\nCourt concluded that merely cumulative evidence regarding\na petitioner’s difficult childhood, and expert testimony\nregarding a petitioner’s mental state “seeking to explain his\nbehavior, or putting it in some favorable context” would not\noutweigh the facts of a brutal murder, and would be even less\nlikely to outweigh evidence that the defendant had committed\na prior murder. 558 U.S. at 22–24, 27–28. Accordingly, the\nCourt concluded that any failure of counsel to present\nadditional mitigating evidence was not prejudicial. Id. at 27.\n\f30                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    These Supreme Court opinions suggest that under\nStrickland’s prejudice prong, cumulative mitigating evidence\ndoes not support a conclusion that there would be a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome. New\nmitigating evidence can support such a conclusion only if it\nis sufficiently strong, and the known or additional\naggravating evidence is not overwhelming.\n\n                                    C\n\n     In light of this guidance, we now evaluate the California\nSupreme Court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim that he was\nprejudiced by his counsel’s failure to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his\ntrial. We must determine whether this decision was “contrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of,” Strickland or\nother Supreme Court precedent in existence at the time of its\nopinion. § 2254(d)(1); see Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1399.\n\n    In considering whether any deficiency by Andrews’s\ncounsel was prejudicial, the California Supreme Court\ncorrectly followed Strickland in asking whether, even if\ncounsel was deficient, Andrews’s defense was not prejudiced\nby any such deficiency because a different result was not\nreasonably probable.5 See In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671\n\n\n   5\n     Andrews argues that the state court failed to apply the correct legal\nstandard established in Tennard v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136994\"><a href=\"/opinion/136994/tennard-v-dretke-director-texas-department-of-criminal-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004) and Smith\nv.

Tennard and Smith require a sentencer to have the\nopportunity to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence,\nbut do not specify what weight the sentencer must give such evidence.\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              31\n\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). The California\nSupreme Court then reasonably carried out the three steps\nindicated by Supreme Court opinions for evaluating prejudice\nat the penalty phase.\n\n                                    1\n\n    The court first considered the totality of the mitigating\nevidence presented at trial, as well as what mitigation could\nhave been presented by a competent attorney, based on the\nsix-year review and report by the referee. See Williams,\n529 U.S. at 397–98. The court reviewed all of the mitigating\nevidence that Andrews presented, including Andrews’s\nfamily background, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660, 670,\nincarceration in Mt. Meigs and in Alabama prisons,6 id. at\n\n\n\nSee Eddings, 455 U.S. at 114–15 (“The sentencer . . . may determine the\nweight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But [courts] may not give\nit no weight by excluding such evidence from their consideration.”).\nHere, the California Supreme Court correctly considered all mitigating\nevidence before weighing its likely effect on a jury. See Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1410.\n 6\n   Andrews’s claim that the state court failed to consider his experiences\nat Mt. Meigs, is not supported by the record. The state court detailed\nAndrews’s experiences at Mt. Meigs when discussing mitigating evidence\nthat could have been presented, noting that “[a]t Mt. Meigs, [Andrews]\nencountered appalling conditions” and detailing the referee’s findings that\nAndrews was “was subjected to beatings, brutality, inadequate conditions\nand sexual predators,” that “[h]is passiveness and small physique caused\nhim to be a target of older, tougher boys, from whom no protection or\nseparation was provided,” and that “Mt. Meigs failed to provide any\nmeaningful rehabilitative or educational opportunities.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 660–61 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state court also\nnoted that expert testimony would have addressed his drug use at Mt.\nMeigs. Id. at 661. Moreover, the state court’s use of the term “prison\n\f32                        ANDREWS V.

Ct. at 1410.\nIt reasonably concluded that much of the evidence identified\nas mitigating “was not conclusively and unambiguously\nmitigating,” and it evaluated the possibility that the evidence\ncould be rebutted or used to Andrews’s disadvantage, or that\ncross examination might “deflate the mitigating impact” of\nthe evidence. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670 & n.9. The court\nreasonably observed that a jury could have determined that\nAndrews’s family background did not reduce his moral\nculpability, given that Andrews was raised in a non-abusive,\nstable family situation. Id. at 670; cf. Bell, 535 U.S. at\n701–02 (suggesting that evidence of a normal youth might\n“cut the other way”). The court reasonably concluded that\n“[Andrews] did not suffer a home environment that would\nplace his crimes in any understandable context or explain his\nresorting to crime every time he was released or escaped from\nprison.” Id. at 670.\n\n    In addition, the state court reasonably determined that the\nevidence regarding the prison conditions was double-edged.\nOn the one hand, the prison conditions evidence left it in “no\ndoubt [that Andrews] endured horrifically demeaning and\n\n\nconditions” in its opinion is consistent with its use in the referee’s report,\nwhere the term referred to conditions both in prison and Mt. Meigs.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              33\n\ndegrading circumstances.” Id. On the other hand, the\nevidence would be presented primarily through the testimony\nof Andrews’s former fellow inmates, who had serious\ncriminal records that could “draw[] an unfavorable\ncomparison” with Andrews. Id. at 671. “Many had\nthemselves engaged in brutality while in prison and escaped\nwith some frequency,” also similar to Andrews. Id.\nMoreover, no matter how the prison conditions evidence was\npresented, “[r]ather than engendering sympathy, the evidence\ncould well have reinforced an impression of him as a person\nwho had become desensitized and inured to violence and\ndisrespect for the law.”7 Id.; cf. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at\n1410.\n\n                                    2\n\n     After assessing the weight of the mitigating evidence and\nits likely impact on a jury, the state court followed Supreme\nCourt guidance by turning to evaluate the weight of the\naggravating evidence at trial, as well as any additional\nrebuttal evidence that could have been introduced. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 20,\n24–28. Consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the state\ncourt considered the circumstances of Andrews’s crime and\nthe nature of his prior criminal history. Turning to the\ncircumstances of the crimes, the state court stated that the\nmurders showed a “callous disregard for human life.” In re\n\n\n    7\n       Andrews argues that the state court made an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts, see § 2254(d)(2), in holding that the prison\nconditions evidence could be aggravating. We reject this argument,\nbecause the state court’s conclusion is a reasonable application of the\nprejudice standard elaborated by Strickland and its progeny, not a factual\nfinding. Cf. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410.\n\f34                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 671; cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 674, 700;\nBelmontes, 558 U.S. at 15, 26–27. Andrews did not\nimpulsively react to a situation that got out of hand; rather, he\ninteracted with the victims in a calm and normal manner\nbefore torturing and killing them. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n671. He also did more than simply kill the victims. He raped\nand sodomized Brandon before murdering her, and he also\nmurdered Wheeler and Chism with “considerable violence\nand evident sangfroid.” Id. The state court also considered\nthat, as rebuttal evidence, the prosecution could have\npresented the details of Andrews’s criminal history, cf. Bell,\n535 U.S. at 700 & n.5; Burger, 483 U.S. at 793, from which\nthe jury might conclude Andrews was “aggressive and\ndesensitized to violence,” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 669. The\njury might also have concluded that this “pattern of\ncriminality” showed Andrews “would pose a danger to others\nif he were sentenced to life imprisonment.”8 Id. Also, the\n\n 8\n   Andrews argues that the state court’s conclusion that the evidence gave\nrise to the inference of future dangerousness was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. He argues that the prison stabbings, laundry\nrobbery, and conditioning to violence during his prison experiences do not\nsupport such an inference, pointing to mitigating facts found by the\nreferee, including that in some incidents, Andrews was defending himself\nagainst inmates who had been threatening him. We disagree. The state\ncourt considered these mitigating facts (such as evidence that in prison\nAndrews was “the prey rather than the predator” and acted in self\ndefense), see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660–61, and reasonably concluded\nthat the evidence that Andrews was conditioned to violence during his\nprison experiences was an aggravating, not mitigating, circumstance, see\nBurger, 483 U.S. at 793 (noting that evidence of a petitioner’s troubled\nfamily background could also “suggest violent tendencies” that could\naffect the jury adversely). Because the state court reasonably concluded\nthat the jury could have found future dangerousness even had the\nmitigating evidence been introduced, the state court did not unreasonably\napply Supreme Court precedent in weighing how the evidence might\nimpact a jury.\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              35\n\nreferences to Andrews’s multiple escapes from prison might\nhave been “inflammatory.” Id.\n\n    Finally, the state court reasonably concluded that the\nprosecution could have presented its own mental health\nexperts in rebuttal, and could have used the mental health\nevidence to Andrews’s disadvantage on cross examination.\nId. at 670. The court noted the referee’s findings that\nprosecution experts could have testified that Andrews had\nnormal intelligence and did not suffer brain damage, but had\nantisocial personality traits.9 Id.; cf. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at\n1396, 1410. Nor was the state court unreasonable in\nconcluding that Andrews’s experts’ testimony could backfire.\nFor instance, the court noted that the “compelling” testimony\nfrom one of Andrews’s expert psychiatric witnesses, opining\nthat Andrews’s prison experience caused him to react with\nrage to perceived insults, could cause a jury to conclude that\nAndrews “was unable to control lethal impulses on the\nslightest provocation.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670; cf.\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410. Finally, the presentation of the\nmental health evidence would have given the prosecutor\nadditional opportunities to repeat the circumstances of these\ncrimes as well as Andrews’s past criminality. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 670.\n\n\n\n\n  9\n    Andrews argues that the state court unreasonably applied Eddings,\n455 U.S. at 114–15, in concluding that a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder is not mitigating. Eddings is not on point, because it\nmerely held that a court cannot prevent a jury from hearing such evidence.\nId. The state court did not unreasonably apply Eddings, or any other\nSupreme Court precedent, by observing that evidence that Andrews had\nantisocial personality disorder might make him less sympathetic to the\njury. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71.\n\f36                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n                                   3\n\n    After evaluating the mitigating and aggravating evidence,\nthe state court re-weighed it and assessed whether it was\nreasonably probable that, in the absence of any deficient\nperformance by counsel, the sentencer “would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 695; see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671–75. The state court\napplied the relevant Supreme Court precedent, and concluded\nthat Andrews was not “prejudiced by counsel’s rejection of\na defense premised on evidence of [Andrews]’s upbringing,\nthe Alabama prison conditions he experienced, and his mental\nhealth in light of the circumstances of the crimes, given the\nambiguous nature of some mitigating evidence and the\nsubstantial potential for damaging rebuttal.” Id. at 671.\n\n    Relying on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Williams\nand Porter, Andrews argues that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision on the issue of prejudice was an\nunreasonable application of Strickland.10 In Williams, the\nSupreme Court held that the state court applied the wrong\nlegal standard, 529 U.S. at 395–97, and so applied Strickland\nde novo to the facts of that case, id. at 397–98; see also\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1410–11. The state court here\ndiscussed Williams at length and reasonably distinguished it\nas having “substantially dissimilar facts.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 675. In Williams, for instance, the defense counsel\ncould have introduced strong character evidence, 529 U.S. at\n\n\n 10\n    While Andrews cites other Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases, his\nargument focuses primarily on Williams and Porter. Because other cases\ncited by Andrews are non-binding, not factually analogous, or both, we do\nnot address them here.\n\f                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS                            37\n\n398, but no comparable evidence of good character was\npresent in Andrews’s case.11 The defendant’s “nightmarish\nchildhood” in Williams, 529 U.S. at 395, 398, was far worse\nthan Andrews’s relatively stable family background, see In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 674. The defendant in Williams was\n“borderline mentally retarded,” 529 U.S. at 396, 398 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), while the prosecution could have\npresented evidence that Andrews was not mentally impaired,\nbut rather had antisocial personality traits, In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 670. The only rebuttal evidence in Williams was\nthe defendant’s three juvenile convictions, 529 U.S. at 396,\ncompared to Andrews’s robbery-murder, hostage taking, and\nhistory of escape from prison, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 675.\nFinally, the circumstances of the crime in Williams were less\nbrutal than Andrews’s triple murder, id., because the\ndefendant in Williams killed the severely inebriated victim\nwith one blow each to the chest and back after an argument,\n529 U.S. at 367–68 & n.1. Because the facts of Williams are\ndissimilar, the Supreme Court’s determination in Williams\nthat counsel’s ineffective assistance was prejudicial does not\nmake the state court’s contrary conclusion here unreasonable.\n See Richter, 562 U.S. at 101–02; see also Pinholster, 131 S.\nCt. at 1410–11.\n\n    Andrews also argues that the state court’s decision was\nunreasonable in light of Porter. Although Porter was decided\nyears after the California Supreme Court’s opinion in this\ncase, we give it careful consideration, because it provides\ndirection for determining under AEDPA what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of Strickland. In Porter, the\n\n\n  11\n     Andrews points to evidence that he appeared to adjust well to the\nAlabama prison system when conditions permitted, but this observation\nis weaker than the evidence in Williams. See 529 U.S. at 396.\n\f38                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nSupreme Court faulted the state court for failing to consider\nall of the mitigating evidence regarding the defendant’s\nfamily background, military service, and mental health issues.\nFor instance, the state court entirely discounted the effect that\nevidence of the defendant’s brain abnormality and cognitive\ndefects might have on a jury. See Porter, 558 U.S. at 42–44.\nFurther, the state court unreasonably discounted mitigating\nevidence of childhood abuse and the defendant’s long record\nof military service. Id. at 43–44. Applying AEDPA, Porter\nheld that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland\nwhen it held that counsel’s failure to introduce this substantial\nmitigation evidence was not prejudicial. Id. at 44.\n\n    The state court’s determinations in Porter are not closely\nanalogous to the state court’s determinations in this case.\nUnlike the state court in Porter, the state court here\nconsidered all mitigation evidence in the record and did not\nfail to consider or “discount to irrelevance” significant\nevidence. See Porter, 558 U.S. at 43. The mitigation\nevidence in Porter, including that the defendant served in\n“horrific” battles of the Korean War, suffered childhood\nphysical abuse, and had a brain abnormality, see id. at 41, is\nless subject to rebuttal than the mitigation evidence in this\ncase, see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71. Unlike here,\nwhere the state’s mental health expert disagreed with the\ndefense experts’ conclusions and added a diagnosis of\nantisocial personality disorder, see id. at 670, in Porter, state\nexperts could not rule out the defense experts’ mental health\ndiagnosis, and the state court erred by failing to consider this\nevidence at all, see 558 U.S. at 36, 42–43. Likewise,\nevidence that the defendant had gone AWOL did not\ndiminish evidence of his military service to “inconsequential\nproportions,” because our nation has a tradition of “according\nleniency to veterans,” and the evidence was “consistent with\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              39\n\n[the] theory of mitigation and [did] not impeach or diminish\nthe evidence of his service.” Id. at 43–44 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Here, by contrast, the state court found that\nAndrews “endured horrifically demeaning and degrading\ncircumstances” in prison before acknowledging this evidence\nwas “double-edged,” because it would also bring before the\njury Andrews’s history of violence both in and out of prison\nand his escapes, which would be emphasized by their\nsimilarity to many of the witnesses who would testify for\nhim. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71. Further, while the\nstate court here reasonably determined that the prosecution\ncould introduce damaging aggravating evidence, id. at 671,\n675, in Porter, the Supreme Court held that the amount of\naggravating evidence would be reduced, because one of the\naggravating factors was invalid, 558 U.S. at 42. Because\nPorter is factually distinct from this case, it has little bearing\non the question whether the state court unreasonably applied\nthe prejudice prong of Strickland.12\n\n    Visciotti, another Supreme Court case that provides\ndirection for determining under AEDPA what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of Strickland, is more closely on\npoint. In Visciotti, the Supreme Court considered a state\ncourt’s rejection of a defendant’s Strickland claim. 537 U.S.\nat 26. The state court had weighed the mitigating evidence,\nincluding the defendant’s brain damage, difficult family\n\n  12\n    Andrews also urges us to apply our recent decision in Doe v.

Doe\nv. Ayers is not pertinent to our analysis here because it is a pre-AEDPA\ncase that does not examine whether the state court’s conclusion was\nunreasonable. See id. at 446, n.31.

After the defendant filed a habeas petition,\nthe district court granted relief and we affirmed. We\nreasoned that counsel’s deficient performance was\nprejudicial, because the “aggravating factors were not\noverwhelming.” Id. at 21–22, 25 (quoting Visciotti v.\nWoodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777515\"><a href=\"/opinion/777515/john-louis-visciotti-petitioner-appellee-cross-appellant-v-jeanne/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (9th Cir. 2002)). The\nSupreme Court reversed.             It explained that “under\n§ 2254(d)(1), it is not enough to convince a federal habeas\ncourt that, in its independent judgment, the state-court\ndecision applied Strickland incorrectly.” Id. at 27 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Rather, “[t]he federal habeas\nscheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for\nthese judgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention\nonly when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable.\nIt is not that here.” Id. In sum, the Court held that “[w]hether\nor not we would reach the same conclusion as the California\nSupreme Court, we think at the very least that the state\ncourt’s contrary assessment was not ‘unreasonable.’” Id.\n(quoting Bell, 535 U.S. at 701) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    Here, as in Visciotti, the state court reweighed Andrews’s\nmitigating evidence against the brutal circumstances of the\ncrime and Andrews’s prior criminal history, and determined\nthere was no reasonable probability that the sentencer would\ndetermine that “the balance of aggravating and mitigating\nfactors did not warrant imposition of the death penalty.” Id.\nat 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). This decision was\n\f                        ANDREWS V.

We therefore reverse the district court’s\ncontrary conclusion.13\n\n                                   III\n\n    Having addressed the state’s cross-appeal, we now turn to\nAndrews’s appeal of the district court’s dismissal of his sole\ncertified claim (Claim 25) that California’s use of its lethal\ninjection protocol to execute him would violate his Eighth\nAmendment rights. According to the district court, the\nCalifornia lethal injection protocol mirrored the Kentucky\nlethal injection protocol upheld by the Supreme Court against\nan Eighth Amendment challenge in Baze v. Rees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145817\"><a href=\"/opinion/145817/baze-v-rees/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2008). The court reasoned that in light of Baze’s ruling, it\nwould be impossible for Andrews to succeed on his challenge\nto California’s lethal injection protocol, and therefore rejected\nthis claim.\n\n\n  13\n    Because we decide Andrews’s claim on prejudice grounds, we need\nnot address the parties’ arguments regarding whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient at the penalty phase.

Although the CDCR substantially\nrevised its protocol in 2007, a state trial court invalidated the\nrevised procedure on the ground that it violated the state’s\nadministrative procedure act. Id. After losing its appeal,\nCDCR promulgated a new procedure, which took effect on\nAugust 29, 2010. Id. at 1064–65. In response to a new legal\nchallenge, a trial court again invalidated the CDCR lethal\ninjection procedure for failure to comply with the state\nadministrative procedure act and permanently enjoined the\nCDCR from administering executions by lethal injection until\nit promulgated new regulations.

Jennings held\nthat a habeas petitioner in such circumstances need not take\na cross-appeal so long as the petitioner did not attempt to\ndefend the district court’s judgment on a theory that seeks “to\nenlarge his rights or lessen the State’s under the District\nCourt’s judgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798,\n801–02.17 Further, because “§ 2253(c) applies only when ‘an\nappeal’ is ‘taken to the court of appeals,’” id. at 802 (quoting\n§ 2253(c)), a petitioner who does not have to take a cross-\nappeal does not need a COA, id.

Accordingly, “[a]ny potential claim that would have\nentitled [the petitioner] to a new sentencing proceeding could\n\n\n             (B) the final order in a proceeding under section\n         2255.\n\n         (2) A certificate of appealability may issue under\n         paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a\n         substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n         right.\n\n         (3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1)\n         shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the\n         showing required by paragraph (2).\n  17\n     Jennings was nonetheless careful to note that a petitioner defending\nhis judgment on appeal would be “confined to those alternative grounds\npresent in the record: he may not simply argue any alternative basis,\nregardless of its origin.” Jennings, 135 S.

Neither\na cross-appeal nor a COA would be required. Id. at 800–02.\nBy contrast, “[a] habeas applicant who has won resentencing\nwould be required to take a cross-appeal in order to raise a\nrejected claim that would result in a new trial.” Id. at 800.\nAnd “if a habeas applicant has won retrial below, a claim that\nhis conduct was constitutionally beyond the power of the\nState to punish would require cross-appeal.” Id. In both such\ncases, a COA would also have been required. See id. at 802.\n\n    Here, Andrews won relief at the district court based on his\ntheory of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of his trial. The district court ordered that “the State of\nCalifornia shall, within 120 days from the entry of this\nJudgment, either grant Petitioner a new penalty phase trial, or\nvacate the death sentence and resentence the Petitioner in\naccordance with California law and the United States\nConstitution.” Accordingly, Andrews’s rights under this\njudgment were for a new penalty phase trial or resentencing\nwithin a fixed time, and Andrews may urge any potential\nclaim present in the record that would entitle him to a new\npenalty phase trial or resentencing without taking a cross-\nappeal or obtaining a COA. See id. at 800–02.\n\n    But none of Andrews’s uncertified claims support the\ndistrict court’s judgment. Five of his claims seek a new guilt\nphase trial (his Strickland, Brady/Napue, Trombetta, and\ncumulative error claims, and a factual innocence claim).18 As\n\n\n 18\n    While the Supreme Court has not ruled on the question whether a free-\nstanding claim of factual innocence is cognizable in habeas, it has\nsuggested that success on such a claim (if cognizable) would entitle a\n\f46                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nexplained in Jennings, because Andrews won resentencing,\nhe must take a cross-appeal and obtain a COA to raise a claim\nthat results in a new trial. Id. His Lackey claim seeks a ruling\nthat the death penalty cannot be constitutionally imposed on\nhim. Because the district court’s order gave the state the right\nto seek the death penalty at a new penalty phase trial,\nAndrews’s Lackey and factual innocence claims seek to\n“lessen the State’s [rights] under the District Court’s\njudgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798. Under\nJennings, Andrews must bring a cross-appeal and obtain a\nCOA to raise these claims as well.\n\n    We lack jurisdiction to consider uncertified claims unless\nwe determine that Andrews “has made a substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right” and grant a COA.\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); see also Ninth Circuit Rule 22-1(e)\n(“Uncertified issues raised and designated [in a petitioner’s\nopening brief] will be construed as a motion to expand the\nCOA . . . .”).

We granted his motion, and ordered the\nstate to respond.\n\n    In his brief, Andrews stated that he raised this claim to the\ndistrict court as Claim 26. In Claim 26, Andrews had argued\nthat executing him after 22 years on death row would be cruel\nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment and would serve no retributive or deterrent\npenological purpose. Claim 26 also asserted that Andrews\ndid not cause any unnecessary delays, but merely sought to\nvindicate his constitutional rights in a system that produced\n\f48                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndelays. Andrews exhausted this claim by raising it to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, which summarily denied it.\n\n    The district court rejected this claim on the merits on the\nground that there has been no demonstration of “any support\nin the American constitutional tradition or in [Supreme\nCourt] precedent for the proposition that a defendant can\navail himself of the panoply of appellate and collateral\nprocedures and then complain when his execution is\ndelayed,” a quote from Knight v.

After\ndiscussing in detail Jones’s reasoning and conclusion that the\nCalifornia death penalty system is unconstitutional, Andrews\nargues that no fairminded jurist could disagree with such a\nconclusion in his case, because he has been continuously\nconfined under sentence of death for more than 30 years, and\nthe delays are caused by factors outside his control.

Therefore, we conclude we may address this issue.\n\n    Next, the state argues that Andrews’s claim was not fairly\npresented to the California Supreme Court or the district\ncourt, and so is both unexhausted and waived. “A federal\ncourt may not grant habeas relief to a state prisoner unless he\nhas properly exhausted his remedies in state court.” Dickens\nv.

Specifically, the\nstate argues that a Lackey claim is an individual challenge,\nbased on the theory that executing a prisoner who has spent\nmany years on death row violates the prohibition on cruel and\nunusual punishment of that prisoner, while Jones was based\non the theory that the California system itself creates the\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       51\n\nconstitutional infirmity, because inordinate delay makes the\nsystem arbitrary and unable to serve a deterrent or retributive\npurpose, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n    We disagree. Andrews’s claim before the state court, the\ndistrict court, and on appeal here is essentially the same\nconstitutional claim: that his right to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment is violated\nby his lengthy incarceration while under a sentence of death.\nAndrews has not introduced any new facts or evidence since\nhe raised this argument to the state court. Andrews’s\nsupplemental brief points to Jones’s conclusion that there are\nsystemic delays in imposing the death penalty throughout the\nCalifornia system, but uses this conclusion to support his\nLackey claim that “inherent delay in capital cases” renders\nexecutions unconstitutional.         Accordingly, Andrews’s\nreferences to Jones do not “fundamentally alter the legal\nclaim already considered by the state courts.” Dickens,\n740 F.3d at 1318 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\ntherefore conclude that Andrews’s uncertified claim, as\nbriefed on appeal, is sufficiently related and intertwined with\nClaim 26 such that Andrews’s exhaustion of Claim 26\nlikewise exhausted his current challenge. See Lounsbury,\n374 F.3d at 788. Moreover, Andrews raised this same claim\nto the district court. Accordingly, Andrews exhausted this\ndelay claim and did not waive it.\n\n    We now consider Andrews’s motion for a COA for this\nclaim. The district court denied Claim 26 because the state\ncourt’s rejection of this claim was not an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent. No reasonable jurist\nwould find the district court’s ruling debatable or wrong. See\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484. As we have previously stated, no\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent holds that\n\f52                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ninordinate delay in the execution of a capital defendant\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\nEighth Amendment. Allen, 435 F.3d at 958–60. Andrews\nargues that the state court’s rejection of his delay claim is\ncontrary to Furman, 408 U.S. at 311–12 (White, J.,\nconcurring), and Gregg, 428 U.S. at 188 (plurality opinion).\nBut these cases articulate a general Eighth Amendment\nstandard that the death penalty is unconstitutional if imposed\narbitrarily, or if the penalty itself does not serve the\npenological purposes of deterrence and retribution. These\nprinciples do not “squarely address[]” the specific issue\nraised by Andrews’s delay claim, and would require a\nsignificant extension of the rationale of Furman and Gregg to\napply in this particular context. See Van Patten, 552 U.S. at\n125–26. Therefore, the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s\ndelay claim was not an unreasonable application of Furman\nor Gregg, and reasonable jurists would not dispute the district\ncourt’s conclusion to that effect. See Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at\n1706–07.\n\n    Because Andrews has not made a “substantial showing”\nthat his Eighth Amendment rights were violated, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), we deny a COA for this claim.\n\n                              B\n\n    We next turn to Andrews’s four uncertified claims\nalleging that trial counsel were ineffective under Strickland\nfor failing to investigate and present four categories of\nevidence.\n\n   The first claim relates to the police’s investigation of\nsuspects before Sanders was arrested and agreed to testify\npursuant to a plea agreement. During the investigation,\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       53\n\npolice officers took statements from at least nine witnesses\nand informally interviewed many others who provided\ninformation about activities in and around Wheeler’s\napartment in the days leading up to the murders. According\nto these statements, Wheeler’s drug customers frequented his\napartment, disturbances were a regular occurrence, and\nshootings had occurred in the apartment. The police did not\nfind any corroborating physical or testimonial evidence\nsuggesting that any of these drug customers was the killer.\nWhen investigating Wheeler’s apartment, the police found\nfingerprints of individuals who had been seen in the\napartment on the evening the murders occurred, but nothing\nlinking them to the crime. The police arrested one drug\ndealer who worked with Wheeler, but ultimately released\nhim. When interrogated, this drug dealer denied murdering\nWheeler, but told the police that a Mexican Mafia member\nhad told him that the Mexican Mafia had murdered Wheeler.\nHe did not provide any corroborating evidence to support this\nstory.\n\n    Relying on this evidence, Andrews claims that his trial\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present\nevidence that third parties, such as Wheeler’s customers and\nfellow dealers, had the motive and opportunity to commit the\nmurders due to their drug-related dealings with Wheeler. The\nstate court summarily rejected this claim when it denied\nAndrews’s second state habeas petition. The district court\ndenied relief on this claim.\n\n    We conclude that reasonable jurists would not find\ndebatable or wrong the district court’s conclusion that this\nclaim fails under Strickland and AEDPA. See Slack,\n529 U.S. at 484. The evidence adduced at trial was\noverwhelming: Sanders, an eyewitness, testified to the events\n\f54                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nof the murders, Brooks testified regarding Andrews’s\nconfession, and the evidence established that Andrews’s palm\nprints were found on either side of Brandon’s body. In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 658. Accordingly, reasonable jurists\nwould not debate the reasonableness of the state court’s\nconclusion that counsel’s failure to further investigate these\nsuspects did not prejudice Andrews’s defense.              See\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     Second, Andrews argues that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence that semen found on\nBrandon’s body could not have come from Andrews. The\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the state court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in rejecting this claim is not\ndebatable, because the state court could reasonably conclude\nthat counsel’s failure to introduce such evidence was not\nprejudicial. The record shows only that slides containing\nsemen found on Brandon’s body contain biological markers\nthat some people secrete and others do not. Andrews does\nnot secrete these markers, but the record is silent as to\nwhether Brandon was a secretor. Andrews offers statistical\nevidence suggesting that Brandon was probably not a\nsecretor, but the evidence is not conclusive. Indeed, even\nother experts testifying for Andrews noted that what minimal\nevidence they obtained was subject to challenge. In light of\nthe eyewitness testimony about Andrews’s involvement in the\nmurders, and his palm prints next to Brandon’s body,\nreasonable jurists would not dispute that the state court\nreasonably concluded that any deficiency by defense counsel\nwas not prejudicial.\n\n    Next, Andrews raises two claims relating to the police\ninvestigation of fingerprint evidence found at Wheeler’s\napartment. As explained by the state court on direct appeal,\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        55\n\ntwo of the police’s fingerprint experts, Howard Sanshuck and\nDonald Keir, testified at trial that they compared 50\nfingerprints found in Wheeler’s apartment with Andrews’s\nfingerprints and palm prints. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at\n289. The two experts concluded that left and right palm\nprints on the kitchen floor on either side of Brandon’s body\nbelonged to Andrews. Id. Sanshuck’s supervisor, Jimmy\nCassel, had previously reviewed the prints and initially\nlabeled them as belonging to Wheeler. Id. Sanshuck\ndiscovered the error shortly before Andrews’s first trial. At\nthe second trial, Cassel stated that the original\nmisidentification was due to his efforts to process the crime\nscene information too quickly, and testified that there was no\nsimilarity between the palm prints found on the kitchen floor\nand Wheeler’s prints. Id. The three experts, Sanshuck, Keir,\nand Cassel, all testified at the second trial that Andrews’s\npalm prints matched the palm prints found on either side of\nBrandon’s body. Id. Andrews has never adduced any\nevidence to rebut this.\n\n    On appeal, Andrews claims that his counsel were\ndeficient in failing to investigate two different lines of\ndefense. First, Andrews claims that counsel performed\ndeficiently by failing to present evidence that Andrews’s\nfingerprints could have been left in Wheeler’s apartment due\nto his prior visits. Second, Andrews claims that counsel\nshould have uncovered and used the police’s original\nmisidentification of his palm prints. Andrews points to other\nreports in the record which he claims shows that Keir and a\nthird analyst, William Leo, also misidentified his fingerprints.\nThe district court rejected this claim. In light of the\nunrebutted evidence that the palm prints found on either side\nof Brandon’s body were Andrews’s prints, no reasonable\njurist would dispute the district court’s determination that the\n\f56                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nstate court could reasonably have concluded that counsel’s\nhandling of the fingerprint evidence did not prejudice\nAndrews’s defense. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     Finally, Andrews claims that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence regarding his alibi\nthe night of the murder. The record shows that Andrews gave\na defense investigator the names of two alibi witnesses and\ninformation on how to locate them, but Andrews did not\nprovide any affidavits from these witnesses to the state court,\nor any further information about the nature of their testimony.\nThe state court and district court rejected this claim. In light\nof the detailed testimony from Sanders and Brooks, the\nevidence of Andrews’s palm prints on either side of\nBrandon’s body, and the lack of any evidence regarding the\nalibi witnesses, no reasonable jurist would dispute that the\nstate court reasonably applied Strickland in concluding that\ncounsel’s failure to further investigate these witnesses was\nnot prejudicial.\n\n    Andrews relies on United States v. Valenzuela–Bernal for\nthe proposition that he could establish his ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim without showing how his alibi\nwitnesses would have testified, because he needed only show\ntheir testimony would be material and favorable to his\ndefense. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110797\"><a href=\"/opinion/110797/united-states-v-valenzuela-bernal/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 (1982). Therefore, Andrews\nclaims, the state court erred in rejecting his Strickland claim.\nThe district court rejected this argument, and we agree.\nValenzuela-Bernal held that when the government deports\naliens who could aid a criminal defendant in his defense,\nthere is no violation of the criminal defendant’s right to\ncompulsory process under the Sixth Amendment unless the\ndefendant “make[s] some plausible showing of how [the alibi\nwitness’s] testimony would have been both material and\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       57\n\nfavorable to his defense.” Id. This ruling does not “squarely\naddress[] the issue,” Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 125–26, or\n“establish a legal principle that clearly extends” to the\nquestion whether Andrews’s counsel’s failure to pursue the\nalibi witnesses was ineffective assistance of counsel, see\nMoses, 555 F.3d at 754 (quoting Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 123)\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim\nwas not an unreasonable application of Valenzuela-Bernal.\nSee Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07.\n\n    In sum, the state court did not unreasonably apply\nStrickland in concluding that Andrews did not create a\n“substantial, not just conceivable” likelihood of a different\nresult, or that “any real possibility of [Andrews’s] being\nacquitted was eclipsed by the remaining evidence pointing to\nguilt,” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112–13; see also Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695–96, and the district court’s determination to\nthis effect was not debatable. Accordingly, Andrews has not\nmade a “substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright,” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), and we decline to issue a\nCOA.\n\n                              C\n\n    Andrews argues that the state court erred in rejecting two\nclaims that his rights under Brady were violated. Brady\nrequires the state to disclose “evidence that is both favorable\nto the accused and material either to guilt or to punishment.”\nU.S. v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (1985) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Evidence is material “if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Id. at 682. Thus, to establish a Brady violation, a\n\f58                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndefendant must prove: 1) “[t]he evidence at issue [is]\nfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\nbecause it is impeaching,” 2) the evidence was\n“suppressed . . . either willfully or inadvertently,” and\n3) prejudice resulted, meaning there is a reasonable\nprobability that disclosing the evidence to the defense would\nhave changed the result. See Strickler v. Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281–82 (1999); Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.\n\n    Andrews claims the state suppressed two pieces of\nevidence. First, he contends that the prosecution failed to\ndisclose a case file maintained by the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment, termed a “murder book,” which contained\nmaterial evidence including the third party culpability and\nfingerprint evidence also advanced in support of his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims. The state court\ncould reasonably have rejected this claim because the state\nhad provided counsel with a chronology of the police\ninvestigation referring to much of the allegedly suppressed\nmurder book evidence. The district court held the state\ncourt’s conclusion was not an unreasonable application of\nBrady. No reasonable jurist could disagree with this\nconclusion, because the state court could reasonably have\nconcluded that the evidence was not suppressed under Brady.\nSee United States v. Dupuy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451681\"><a href=\"/opinion/451681/united-states-v-albert-dupuy-united-states-of-america-v-christie-buzard/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1501 n.5 (9th Cir.\n1985) (holding the government does not suppress evidence\nfor purposes of Brady where “the means of obtaining the\nexculpatory evidence [was] provided to the defense”).\nMoreover, the state court could have reasonably concluded\nthat the result of the proceeding would not have been\ndifferent even if the evidence had been disclosed to the\ndefense. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         59\n\n     For the same reason, no reasonable jurist could disagree\nwith the district court’s rejection of Andrews’s second Brady\nclaim, that the prosecution withheld the fact that Brooks was\nsubject to charges of welfare fraud. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that defense counsel had\nsufficient information to discover that charges had been filed,\nbecause defense counsel knew that Brooks was being\ninvestigated for welfare fraud, and questioned her about it at\ntrial, outside the presence of the jury. See Dupuy, 760 F.2d\nat 1501 n.5.\n\n    Andrews also raises claims under Napue, which provides\nthat the state may not “knowingly use false evidence,\nincluding false testimony” or “allow[] it to go uncorrected\nwhen it appears.” 360 U.S. at 269. According to Andrews,\nthe state knowingly adduced false testimony from two\nfingerprint experts, Keir and Sanshuck. First, Andrews notes\nthat a report in the record, dated August 4, 1980, states that\nKeir reviewed “fingers” from a suspect named “Walters” (the\nalias being used by Andrews at the time) and concludes that\nthe prints were “not made.” This means, Andrews argues,\nthat Keir lied in identifying the palm prints found by\nBrandon’s body as being from Andrews, and also lied when\nhe testified that he first examined Andrews’s palm prints in\nNovember 1983. The state asserts Keir did not testify falsely,\nbecause the report references fingerprints, while Keir testified\nregarding palm prints. Second, Andrews argues that\nSanshuck’s testimony that police policy did not require\nphotographs to be taken of prints on the surface from which\nthey were lifted was false, because it contradicted a Los\nAngeles Police Department Homicide Manual, dated 1981.19\n\n   19\n      The Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Manual states in\npertinent part:\n\f60                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nThe state argues that no false information was knowingly\npresented, see id., because the homicide manual used\npermissive, not mandatory, language, and because the\nmanual’s statement did not reflect the police department’s\nactual practice, which was the subject of Sanshuck’s\ntestimony. The district court rejected Andrews’s Napue\nclaims, and no reasonable jurist could disagree that the state\ncourt could reject these claims based on the reasonable view\nof the facts offered by the state. See Taylor v. Maddox,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786028\"><a href=\"/opinion/786028/leif-taylor-v-thomas-m-maddox-interim-director-george-galaza-cal-terhune/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999–1000 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that under\nAEDPA, state court fact finding must be not merely wrong,\nbut “actually unreasonable” and without support in the record\nto warrant habeas relief).\n\n                                  D\n\n    Andrews makes three claims based on the fact that\nbetween 1993 and 1995, all biological evidence in this case\nwas destroyed, except for 50 fingerprint cards, one vaginal\nslide, one oral slide, and one anal slide. His petition to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court claimed that the destruction of the\nevidence violated his due process rights under Trombetta and\nArizona v. Youngblood, a case that held that the government’s\n“failure to preserve potentially useful evidence” before trial\ndoes not violate a defendant’s due process rights unless the\ncriminal defendant can show that the government acted in bad\nfaith. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1988). As Andrews acknowledges,\n\n\n       Note: (A) Photographing Prints\n\n       Prints found at the scene of a homicide should be\n       photographed. The procedure is recommended because\n       it is much easier to introduce print evidence into court\n       if the print has been photographed, as parts of the object\n       which carried the print may show in the picture.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        61\n\nthe Supreme Court has since held that cases assessing pre-\nconviction access to evidence, which would include\nTrombetta and Youngblood, do not apply to cases where a\ndefendant is denied access to evidence after being convicted.\nSee Dist. Attorney’s Office for the Third Judicial District v.\nOsborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145860\"><a href=\"/opinion/145860/district-attorneys-office-for-third-judicial-dist-v-osborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61–62, 68–69, 74 (2009); see also\nCress v.

Therefore, the California Supreme\nCourt did not unreasonably apply Trombetta or Youngblood.\nAndrews relies on Osborne to make a second claim, that the\ndestruction of evidence violated his due process and Eighth\nAmendment rights. We do not consider whether the state\ncourt’s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Osborne, because it was decided after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court ruled, and thus is not clearly\nestablished precedent for purposes of § 2254(d)(1). This\ntheory was not briefed to the district court, as the case was\ndecided between completion of briefing and the court’s\ndecision. Andrews points to no clearly established precedent\nin existence at the time the state court ruled that applies this\nprinciple, and therefore the district court’s rejection of this\nclaim was not debatable among fair minded jurists.\n\n    Andrews’s third claim is that the destruction of evidence\ndenied him access to the courts to vindicate an underlying\nclaim of factual innocence. However, as the district court\nrecognized in rejecting this claim, he cites no Supreme Court\nprecedent clearly establishing that destruction of evidence\nafter a defendant is convicted violates a right of access to the\ncourts. Christopher v. Harbury, on which Andrews relies, is\nnot on point: it held that a plaintiff’s claim that government\nofficials misled her in connection with her husband’s\n\f62                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndisappearance did not state a constitutional denial of access\nclaim upon which relief could be granted. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407,\n415, 418–19 (2002). Accordingly, no reasonable jurist could\ndispute that the district court correctly denied this claim.\n\n                               E\n\n    In light of the above, we conclude that no reasonable\njurist would disagree with the district court in rejecting\nAndrews’s cumulative error claim. “[T]he fundamental\nquestion in determining whether the combined effect of trial\nerrors violated a defendant’s due process rights is whether the\nerrors rendered the criminal defense ‘far less persuasive,’ and\nthereby had a ‘substantial and injurious effect or influence’\non the jury’s verdict.” Parle v. Runnels, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1384064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1384064/parle-v-runnels/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 928\n(9th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted) (quoting Chambers v.\nMississippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (1973) and Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (1993)). We agree with the\ndistrict court that the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined that any errors, in the aggregate, did not have\nsuch a substantial or injurious effect on the verdict. The\ncumulative result of the disputable errors identified by\nAndrews would not have made his defense significantly more\npersuasive, since his defense focused on attacking the\ncredibility of Sanders and Brooks and challenging the\nfingerprint and palm print evidence. Reasonable jurists\nwould not dispute the district court’s conclusion, so no COA\nis warranted.\n\n    Nor would any reasonable jurist disagree with the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the state court did not err in rejecting\nAndrews’s factual innocence claim.

This claim does not merit\na COA.\n\n    In sum, because the district court’s conclusions, under\nAEDPA review, are not debatable among reasonable jurists,\nAndrews fails to make the “substantial showing of the denial\nof a constitutional right” required for a COA to issue, and we\ndeny his request for one as to each of his uncertified claims.\n\n                                  V\n\n    Andrews contends that the district court erred in denying\nhis motion for an evidentiary hearing on 16 claims (Claims\n1–8, 15, 19–23, 25, and 32), which include all but one of the\nclaims on appeal here.20 We review a district court’s denial\nof an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion, Sully v.\nAyers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1067 (9th Cir. 2013), and “may affirm\nthe district court’s decision on any ground supported by the\nrecord, even if it differs from the district court’s rationale,”\nid.
