Philip Henry Wright, Assistant United States\nAttorney, Charleston, West Virginia, for Appellee. ON BRIEF:\nRebecca A. Betts, United States Attorney, Charleston, West Virginia,\nfor Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nHALL, Senior Circuit Judge:\n\nAppellants raise numerous challenges to their convictions and sen-\ntences stemming from their involvement in an investment fraud\nscheme and the subsequent coverup. We conclude that their chal-\nlenges lack merit and therefore affirm the judgments below. We also\nconclude that pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, federal forfeiture\nlaw supersedes the garnishment protections that Georgia state law\nprovides for funds in an individual retirement account.\n\n                  2\n\fI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arose out of a wide-ranging investment fraud scheme,\ncarried out by a network of conspirators, who bilked millions of dol-\nlars from investors across the country. The investments were pro-\ngrams that promised enormous profits, supposedly derived from\nsecret trading in debentures issued by European \"prime\" banks. The\nconspirators included Stephen Oles, a self-described\"trader\" in the\nfraudulent investment programs; appellant Ernst Tietjen, another\ntrader; Ramona Holcombe and Stanie Benz, who served as \"project\nmanagers\" or \"directors\" for the programs; appellant Gary Bollin, a\n\"broker\" for the fraudulent investments; Roger Damron, who offered\nthe investments in and near Huntington, West Virginia; David Raimer\nand his wife, Jennifer, who conducted numerous bank transactions\ninvolving investors' funds; and appellant James Gormley, an attorney\nfrom Atlanta, Georgia, who advised and assisted Oles, David Raimer,\nBollin, and Damron with the fraudulent investments and money laun-\ndering. The cast of characters relevant to Appellants also included\nFinbar F. Dempsey & Company, a law firm in the Turks and Caicos\nIslands; Robert Edwards, an escrow agent and attorney in Atlanta; Dr.\nRalph and Rita Touma, investors; and other investors in the programs.1\n                                                                     1\n\nIn mid-1995, David Raimer and Oles began offering investment\nprograms under the name \"Exodus International.\" The programs\ninvolved supposed trading of European \"prime bank\" debentures and\npromised very high rates of return with little or no risk to investors.\nAccording to the Exodus literature that they distributed, the programs\nwere available on a limited basis to groups of investors whose money\nwould be pooled and delivered to a \"prime\" bank. The investment\nprincipal was supposedly secured by a bank guarantee and, therefore,\nwas never at risk. Millions of dollars in profits were to be generated\nwithin a few months from the trading of debentures. For example, one\nprogram, \"Program 39,\" offered a profit of $73,000,000 in ten\nmonths, based on an investment of $400,000.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 Because only the appeals of Bollin, Tietjen, and Gormley are before\nus, we limit our discussion of the facts to those facts relevant to Appel-\nlants.\n\n                  3\n\fTo carry out the scheme, bank accounts were established with the\nguidance and assistance of Oles's attorney, appellant Gormley.\nRaimer established an escrow account in Orlando, Florida, under the\nname \"Exodus International.\" Per Gormley's advice, the account was\nto be non-interest bearing so as to avoid attracting the IRS's attention.\nThe account was to be used ostensibly to deliver investors' funds into\na debenture trading program. Gormley also helped establish an off-\nshore account in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the name of \"BCI\nCorporation,\" which was part of a so-called \"three-tiered\" offshore\ntrust. According to Gormley, the offshore trust would shield income\nfrom taxation and was the \"vehicle\" through which the debenture\ntrading program was to be conducted.\n\nAppellant Bollin learned about Exodus International Program 39 in\nMay 1995. At Oles' suggestion, Bollin discussed the program with\nGormley. Gormley explained to Bollin how the program worked and\ndrew a sketch for him showing how funds would move through the\nprogram. Gormley told Bollin that debenture trading programs work\n\"if they're handled right\" and that \"once they start paying, they pay\nforever.\" After Bollin gave Gormley literature about Program 39,\nGormley told him that the program looked \"pretty good.\"\n\nGormley also recommended the Exodus International Program to\nStanie Benz. Gormley told Benz that he had extensive experience\nreviewing debenture trading programs and that he had reviewed the\nExodus Program and found it to be a good investment. Gormley\nexplained the relationship between debenture trading programs and\noffshore trust accounts, and described how such an account could be\nused as a holding point for pooling investors' funds and for transfer-\nring funds without their being traceable.\n\nBollin introduced the Exodus Program 39 to Roger Damron. At\nBollin's recommendation, on July 20, 1995, Damron met with Gorm-\nley. Gormley advised Damron concerning the Program 39 literature\nand debenture trading programs in general, and advised him on for-\neign grantor trusts to facilitate the investments and avoid tax liability.\nGormley had Finbar F. Dempsey & Company set up foreign grantor\ntrusts in the Turks and Caicos Islands for Damron and Bollin. Gorm-\nley also established international business corporations for Damron\nand Bollin and advised them about their use in conducting business\n\n                   4\n\ffor the trusts. In addition, Gormley prepared several documents for\nBollin and Damron, such as profit sharing agreements. The idea was\nthat Damron would bring investors into the programs, Bollin would\nact as the broker, and Ramona Holcombe would serve as the program\nmanager and link to the trader, Stephen Oles, who would conduct the\nactual trading.\n\nDamron approached a couple with whom he had a previous invest-\nment relationship, Dr. Ralph and Rita Touma, and sought money to\nplace in Exodus Program 39.22 The Toumas decided to invest, and, in\nlate July 1995, gave Damron $750,000. Damron put $400,000 in an\nescrow account held by Robert Edwards, another Atlanta attorney,\nawaiting an opening in Program 39. Unbeknownst to the Toumas,\nDamron paid Bollin $75,000 from this money.\n\nOn September 13, 1995, Holcombe faxed to Gormley the wire\ncoordinates to transfer funds into Program 39. Gormley forwarded the\nfax to Bollin, who then faxed it to Damron.3\n                                           3 Then, on September 19,\n1995, Gormley drafted a letter for Damron's signature, directing the\ntransfer of the $400,000 from Edwards' escrow account to Bollin's\nforeign grantor trust in the Turks and Caicos Islands, an account set\nup by Gormley. Damron signed the letter and sent it to Edwards.\nEdwards wired the money as instructed on September 20, 1995.4  4A\nfew days later, the money was again transferred, this time from Bol-\nlin's trust account to Damron's trust account, also set up by Gormley\nin the Turks and Caicos Islands. From Damron's account, the money\nwas sent to the BCI Corporation account in the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, an account controlled by Oles and Raimer.\n\nAfter the Toumas' money was sent off, Damron began collecting\nmoney from other people for investment in another, similar trading\nprogram, the \"second deal.\" Bollin told Damron that the second deal\nwould again involve Oles as the trader, but would involve Benz as the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 According to Damron, Dr. and Mrs. Touma were his \"best customers\"\nin the Gold Eagle Program, a program run by Damron that involved\ninvestments in gold coins.\n\n3 This fax is the basis for the wire fraud charge in Count Three.\n\n4 The transfer of the $400,000 is the basis for the money laundering\ncharge in Count Six.\n\n                  5\n\f\"project director.\" Oles later \"lateraled\" his role as the trader to appel-\nlant Tietjen. Although the second deal was similar to Exodus Program\n39, instead of the money going to Oles' BCI Corporation account in\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, the money was transferred to an\naccount in England.\n\nOles had introduced Tietjen to Benz. Tietjen was the head of a\nchurch known as the Apostolic Order of the Remnant House of Israel\n(AORHI). According to Tietjen, AORHI existed wherever he lived,\nsupposedly for the purpose of funding humanitarian projects. To ful-\nfill its purpose, AORHI created other entities, which Tietjen called\nlimited trusts, to hold assets, and an entity called General Securities,\nLtd. (GSL), to \"assist in the money-making.\" Under cover of these\nentities, Tietjen created official-looking financial documents, such as\na \"Zero Coupon Prime Capital Note,\" and offered debenture trading\nprograms with very high rates of return. In all, Tietjen received, or\nexpected to receive, $2.4 million of investors' funds for placement in\nhis debenture trading program.\n\nAfter Damron sent the money for the second deal, he collected\nanother $140,000 from investors in November and December 1995\nfor placement in yet another debenture trading program, the \"third\ndeal.\" In January 1996, Damron wired $130,000 of the investors'\nmoney to his account in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The money\nwas to be sent off for investment.\n\nAs it turned out, the debenture trading programs were complete\nfrauds. The Government's expert explained that investment programs\ninvolving the trading of debentures or other financial instruments\nissued by so-called \"prime banks\" do not exist. Indicators of the\nfraudulent nature of such programs include the use of the term \"prime\nbank;\" convoluted and nonsensical descriptions of the investment pro-\ngram itself; very unrealistic rates of return with little or no risk; an\nassertion that investors' funds represented \"good, clean cleared funds\nof non-criminal origin;\" and the claim that entities such as the Federal\nReserve Bank or the World Bank had approved the programs or\naccepted the documents. These characteristics of fraud were present\nin the Exodus Program 39 documents.\n\nInstead of placing the money into bank debentures, Oles transferred\nthe money from the BCI Corporation account to the Exodus Interna-\n\n                  6\n\ftional account in Orlando. David Raimer withdrew funds from the\naccount and sent cash to Oles upon request. Oles used these funds for\nhimself, and Raimer also kept large sums. The funds sent to Tietjen\nsimilarly were not placed in a debentures trading program, but instead\nworked their way through various accounts in the names of AORHI\nand others, with much of the money being used by Tietjen for his own\npurposes.\n\nWhen the Toumas, Damron's investors in Program 39, did not\nreceive payments as promised, they began to call Damron regularly\nto find out when their payouts would materialize. Oles reportedly\nassured Bollin that payments were imminent. In turn, Bollin reassured\nDamron, who, in turn, reassured the Toumas. After more time passed\nwithout a payout, the Toumas eventually spoke with Bollin and Gor-\nmley. Bollin assured them that the payout would come and that he,\nlike them, was waiting for money. He also told them that he had pre-\nviously traded in these programs and that while it was normal for pay-\nment to be delayed, the programs always paid. Bollin said that he\nwould get paid only if the investment paid out, failing to disclose that\nDamron had already paid him $75,000 out of the Toumas' money.\nGormley told the Toumas that he did not know much about their\ninvestment, but that he knew these programs did pay out in the past,\nand that the delays \"usually work themselves out in a week or so.\"\nGormley told the Toumas that they had the option to sue Oles for\ntheir money, but warned that a law suit would only lead to more\ndelays in receiving their money.\n\nBollin also spoke with another investor, Marianne Bradley, who\nhad invested as part of the second deal. When Bradley asked about\nthe status of her investment, Bollin stated that \"trades are being\nmade,\" that trading had started on January 16, and that \"we\" had \"fro-\nzen the account to protect the money.\" Bollin also stated that he had\ninvested $100,000 in the same program as Bradley and that he would\noccasionally get involved in a trading program with $100,000 to\n$500,000. He stated that based on his experience, the program would\neither pay out as promised in ten days or Bradley would get her\nmoney back. Bollin, however, did not invest any of his own money\nin the second deal, and his only investment experience had been a\n$100 investment several years before.\n\n                  7\n\fFinally, in January 1996, the Toumas reported their dealings with\nDamron to the FBI. On February 9, 1996, the FBI conducted a search\nof Damron's house. Shortly thereafter, a grand jury investigation was\ncommenced in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nDamron decided to return to the investors the $130,000 sent to his\naccount in the Turks and Caicos Islands for the third deal. Damron\nwired over $120,000 of the money to Gormley and $8,000 to himself\nso that Gormley could arrange for checks to the investors. Gormley\nalso arranged for backdated paperwork to be created by the attorneys\nin the Turks and Caicos Islands to explain the earlier transfer of\n$130,000 as a \"loan\" from one of Damron's companies to another.\nThe loan paperwork was created in March 1996, but was backdated\nto January 17, 1996, the date of the $130,000 transfer.\n\nDamron was eventually indicted for his involvement in the invest-\nment fraud scheme. After the indictment, Oles decided to send Dam-\nron $50,000. Damron was then under a financial reporting\nrequirement with the court. He contacted Gormley, who advised him\nhow to structure the transaction so as to avoid the court-imposed\nreporting requirement. On Gormley's advice, the transfer was struc-\ntured as a loan from Bollin's wife to Damron's wife. Bollin kept\n$10,000 for himself and sent the remaining $40,000 to Damron in\nincrements of $5,000. Gormley also assisted in Damron's receipt of\nan additional $100,000 from Oles, again funneled through the Turks\nand Caicos Islands.\n\nIn August 1997, Gormley informed Damron that Oles was again\nsending money to Damron, $400,000, to be used to pay back certain\ninvestors. Gormley and Damron discussed how to use the money for\n\"damage control.\" They decided to repay Damron's numerous inves-\ntors in the second deal but not the Toumas. Damron prepared a list\nof investors who had invested in the program and how much they had\ninvested. He gave the list to Gormley. Later, Damron sent a separate\nletter to Paul Dempsey in the Turks and Caicos Islands, detailing the\ninvestors who were to receive payments and directing that the pay-\nments be made. A copy of that letter with Damron's handwritten nota-\ntion that it had been faxed to Dempsey was found in Gormley's\noffice. The investors listed in Damron's letter were all paid, receiving\nchecks from the Turks and Caicos Islands in plain envelopes with no\n\n                  8\n\freturn address and no cover letter. Approximately $400,000 was\nrepaid to twenty investors. Gormley was paid $20,000 by Oles for his\nservices.\n\nWhen the Government learned of the payments to the investors,\nwho were potential witnesses against Damron, it sought to have the\nmoney placed in escrow pending resolution of Damron's case. At a\nhearing in October 1997, Gormley testified that to his knowledge,\nDamron had not directed, coordinated, or orchestrated the payments\nto investors.\n\nDamron eventually pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laun-\ndering and agreed to cooperate with the United States in its investiga-\ntion of the other conspirators. On September 9, 1998, Appellants Gary\nBollin, Ernst Tietjen, and James Gormley were charged in a fourteen-\ncount indictment, along with co-defendants Stephen Oles, Ramona\nHolcombe, Stanie Benz, David Raimer, and Jennifer Raimer, for\ncriminal acts stemming from the fraudulent investment scheme.\n\nCount One charged all defendants with conspiring to commit wire\nfraud, securities fraud, and obstruction of justice, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged all defendants with violating 18\nU.S.C. § 1956(h), conspiracy to launder money. The indictment also\nincluded a forfeiture provision as to all defendants, premised upon a\nconviction for money laundering, and included a notice to seek substi-\ntute assets. Tietjen was not named in any of the other counts.\n\nBoth Gormley and Bollin faced additional charges. Both were\ncharged in Count Three with aiding and abetting wire fraud, in viola-\ntion of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 2. Count Six charged them with aiding\nand abetting money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and 2. Bollin was also charged in Count Four\nwith an additional count of wire fraud, and in Counts Seven and Eight\nwith two more counts of money laundering. In Counts Nine and Ten,\nBollin was charged with selling securities without having registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, in violation of 15\nU.S.C. §§ 78o(a)(1) and 78ff. Gormley was charged in Counts Thir-\nteen and Fourteen with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The\ndistrict court dismissed Count Fourteen at trial.\n\n                  9\n\fBefore trial, defendants David Raimer and Stanie Benz pleaded\nguilty to charges in the indictment. The charges against Jennifer\nRaimer were dismissed. Stephen Oles fled and remained a fugitive\nthroughout the trial. On November 19, 1999, a jury returned a guilty\nverdict against the remaining defendants on each count submitted to\nthe jury. The jury also returned a $1.2 million forfeiture verdict. The\ndistrict court denied the post-trial motions for judgment of acquittal\nand/or a new trial made by Gormley, Bollin, and Tietjen.\n\nThe district court sentenced Bollin to 108 months imprisonment,\nthree years supervised release, and restitution in the amount of\n$783,535.55 The court sentenced Tietjen to 135 months imprisonment,\ntwo years supervised release, and $1,761,035 in restitution.6\n                                                            6 The court\nsentenced Gormley to 97 months imprisonment, three years super-\nvised release, and $783,545 in restitution.7\n                                           7 Each defendant was also\nfound jointly and severally liable for the $1.2 million forfeiture.8\n                                                                   8 Fol-\nlowing the entry of judgment against each defendant, each defendant\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.\n\nII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nAppellant Gormley challenges the sufficiency of the evidence sup-\nporting his convictions on Counts One, Two, Three, Six, and Thir-\nteen. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court\nmust take the evidence in the light most favorable to the government\nand must determine whether any rational juror could have found the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 Bollin was sentenced to 108 months imprisonment on Counts Two,\nSix, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten, and 60 months on Counts One, Three\nand Four, to run concurrently.\n\n6 Tietjen was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment on Count One and\n135 months on Count Two, to run concurrently.\n\n7 Gormley was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment on Counts One,\nThree, and Thirteen, and 97 months on Counts Two and Six, to run con-\ncurrently.\n\n8 In an interlocutory appeal, Gormley challenged the district court's rul-\ning that he could be held jointly and severally liable for any forfeitable\nassets possessed by his codefendants. This court affirmed in an unpub-\nlished opinion. United States v. Gormley, 176 F.3d 476, 1999 WL\n212008 (4th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (unpublished).\n\n                  10\n\felements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v.\nBurgos, 94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir. 1996).\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count One--\n        Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, Securities Fraud,\n        and Obstruction of Justice\n\nTo support a conviction for conspiracy, \"the government must\nshow, first, that a conspiracy existed; then that the defendant had\nknowledge of the conspiracy; and finally, that the defendant voluntar-\nily became a part of the conspiracy.\" United States v. Bell, 954 F.2d\n232, 236 (4th Cir. 1992), overruled on other grounds by Burgos, 94\nF.3d at 862. Gormley contends that the Government proved three dis-\ntinct conspiracies instead of the single conspiracy alleged in Count\nOne of the indictment: one conspiracy to commit wire fraud, a second\nconspiracy to commit securities fraud, and a third conspiracy to\nobstruct justice. Gormley argues that the Government's proof resulted\nin a material variance.\n\nA \"variance\" occurs when \"the evidence at trial establishes facts\nmaterially different from those alleged in the indictment.\" United\nStates v. Kennedy, 32 F.3d 876, 883 (4th Cir. 1994). A defendant may\nestablish that a material variance occurred \"by showing that the\nindictment alleged a single conspiracy but that the government's\nproof at trial established the existence of multiple, separate conspira-\ncies.\" Id.; see also Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 755-56\n(1946). The question whether the evidence shows a single or multiple\nconspiracies is for the jury, and the finding of a single conspiracy\nmust stand unless the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to\nthe Government, would not allow any reasonable juror to reach such\na verdict. United States v. Urbanik, 801 F.2d 692, 695 (4th Cir. 1986).\n\nWe are satisfied that the jury's finding of a single conspiracy was\nsupported by substantial evidence. Although the conspiracy had mul-\ntiple objects--wire fraud, securities fraud, and obstruction--the\nobjects clearly were related to the overall goal of defrauding investors\nthrough fraudulent offshore debentures trading programs. See United\nStates v. Squillacote, 221 F.3d 542, 574 (4th Cir. 2000) (explaining\nthat a close relation between the objects of alleged separate conspira-\ncies supports a finding of a single conspiracy), cert. denied, 121 S.Ct.\n\n                  11\n\f1601 (2001); United States v. Walsh, 544 F.2d 156, 161 (4th Cir.\n1976) (noting that a single conspiracy may have multiple objects).\nThe co-conspirators obtained funds from investors through securities\nfraud. The wire fraud was used to move the investors' funds into the\nhands of Oles, the Raimers, and Tietjen. The obstruction was part of\ncontrolling the damage after Damron came under investigation for his\nrole in the fraudulent debentures trading program.\n\nThe fact that some of the co-conspirators, including Gormley,\nnever marketed the debentures trading programs to the actual inves-\ntors does not prevent a finding of a single conspiracy because a defen-\ndant may be a member of a conspiracy without taking part in all of\nits activities. See United States v. Banks, 10 F.3d 1044, 1054 (4th Cir.\n1993). Similarly, a single conspiracy may be found even though Tiet-\njen, Holcombe, and Benz were not active in returning money to inves-\ntors. The very structure of the scheme in this case required the\nconspirators to play different roles--brokers, project managers, and\ntraders--to carry out the fraud and obscure the disposition of funds\nplaced in the trading programs. Gormley prepared the different instru-\nments used to carry out the scheme to defraud investors and directed\nthe opening of the offshore trusts. Further, because a shifting mem-\nbership in the conspiracy does not preclude a finding of a single con-\nspiracy, a single conspiracy may be found even though Benz and\nTietjen were involved only in later deals. United States v. Lozano, 839\nF.2d 1020, 1023 (4th Cir. 1988). Finally, regardless of whether \"hos-\ntility\" arose between Oles on one side and Damron, Gormley and Bol-\nlin on the other after Damron was indicted in 1997, Oles was the\nsource of the funds sent to Damron and the source of the funds used\nto repay investors, thus supporting the conclusion that they were par-\nticipating in a common scheme. In sum, the evidence was sufficient\nto support the jury's finding of a single conspiracy.99\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 The evidence also was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that\nGormley was part of the conspiracy. Gormley was involved with Oles,\nthe Raimers, Bollin, and Damron from the very beginning. Gormley\nknew how the Exodus Program worked, as we discuss in more detail\nbelow, knew the program was fraudulent, and took actions in furtherance\nof the scheme. After Damron was placed under investigation, Gormley\nalso played a role in the return of funds to investors.\n\n                  12\n\fMoreover, even if the evidence established separate conspiracies,\na variance is grounds for reversal only if it infringed the defendant's\n\"`substantial rights' and thereby resulted in actual prejudice.\" Ken-\nnedy, 32 F.3d at 883. \"In order to show actual prejudice stemming\nfrom a multiple conspiracy variance, an appellant must prove that\n`there are so many defendants and so many separate conspiracies\nbefore the jury' that the jury was likely to transfer evidence from one\nconspiracy to a defendant involved in an unrelated conspiracy.\" Id.\n(quoting United States v. Caporale, 806 F.2d 1487, 1500 (11th Cir.\n1989)).\n\nIn Kennedy, we held that an alleged variance had no prejudicial\neffect because there was \"no possibility that evidence from unrelated\nconspiracies would be improperly attributed to individual defen-\ndants.\" Kennedy, 32 F.3d at 883. Kennedy involved eight defendants\nand, at most, three related conspiracies. We recognized that \"cases\ninvolving similar numbers of defendants and conspiracies are `not so\ncomplex by definition that the jury will be unable to segregate the evi-\ndence properly.'\" Id. (quoting Caporale, 806 F.2d at 1501 (eleven\ndefendants and two conspiracies)). Further, the fact that the district\ncourt ordered a severance, and each defendant thus faced trial alone,\nvirtually eliminated any likelihood of prejudicial \"spillover\" of evi-\ndence. Id.\n\nLike in Kennedy, this case involves only eight named defendants\nand, if there was a variance, at most three conspiracies. Although the\ndistrict court did not order a severance, only four of the eight defen-\ndants named in the indictment were tried together. Further, the district\ncourt granted Gormley's request for a multiple objects jury instruc-\ntion, instructing the jury to consider each defendant's role in the con-\nspiracy. The verdict form required the jury to make particularized\nfindings about which objects each defendant conspired to violate, fur-\nther helping the jury to compartmentalize the evidence as to each\ndefendant. Any risk of a \"spillover effect\" was slight. Gormley's con-\nviction on Count One is affirmed.\n\nB. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Three, Wire Fraud\n\nTo convict Gormley for wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1343, \"the government must prove: `1) a scheme to defraud and 2)\n\n                  13\n\fthe use of a wire communication in furtherance of that scheme.'\"\nUnited States v. ReBrook, 58 F.3d 961, 966 (4th Cir. 1995) (quoting\nUnited States v. Brandon, 50 F.3d 464, 467 (7th Cir. 1995)); see also\n18 U.S.C. § 1343. Gormley argues that the evidence is insufficient to\nprove that he transmitted or caused to be transmitted to Damron a\nSeptember 13, 1995, memorandum, which furnished the wire coordi-\nnates for investors to send funds to Oles' offshore Exodus account.\nGormley also argues that the Government failed to prove that Gorm-\nley knew the funds to be sent to Oles' offshore account came from\nthe Toumas, and thus the Government failed to prove that Gormley\nhad the requisite fraudulent intent. We conclude that the evidence was\nsufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\nHolcombe testified that she faxed the memorandum containing the\nwire coordinates to Gormley's office on September 13, 1995, and the\nfax headers on the document confirm her testimony. Damron testified\nthat he received the memorandum from Bollin on September 13,\n1995. Bollin testified that he could not recall how he obtained the\ndocument. Holcombe, however, testified that she faxed the memoran-\ndum only to Gormley because she believed that he was the person\ncontrolling the funds. Although Gormley shared office space with\nseven to nine other attorneys, he was a sole practitioner, and the attor-\nneys in Gormley's space-sharing arrangement did not share clients.\nThere is no evidence that Bollin worked with any of the other attor-\nneys in Gormley's office. The evidence supports the conclusion that\nGormley received the memorandum from Holcombe and furnished it\nto Bollin, who in turn sent the memorandum to Damron.\n\nFurther, assuming that Gormley did not know the $400,000 came\nfrom the Toumas,1010 Gormley's lack of knowledge is irrelevant\nbecause, as the Government points out, it was not required to prove\nthat anyone had put up any money and had actually been defrauded\nin the wire fraud scheme (i.e., that the scheme succeeded), so long as\nthe act of wire fraud was in furtherance of the scheme. See United\nStates v. Bryan, 58 F.3d 933, 943 (4th Cir. 1995), abrogated on other\ngrounds by United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 650 (1997). Gor-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 As we discuss below, there was sufficient evidence from which the\njury could infer that Gormley was aware that the Toumas had contributed\nto the $400,000.\n\n                  14\n\fmley's delivery of the wire coordinates for Oles' offshore account\nwas in furtherance of the fraudulent investment scheme. Moreover,\nthere is sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that, by\nthe time of the September 13, 1995, fax, Gormley knew the scheme\nwas fraudulent. Gormley was a self proclaimed securities lawyer, and\nhe claimed to be an expert on investment programs. Gormley\nreviewed the Exodus Program documents and was aware that the Pro-\ngram was a prime bank debentures trading program. The Govern-\nment's expert testified that there were numerous indicators of fraud\nin the Exodus Program documents that should have raised a red flag\nto an experienced securities lawyer. If Gormley was not already\naware that the debentures trading program was a scam, on August 17,\n1995, Gormley met with Agent David Caruso of the Federal Bureau\nof Investigations, who explained the fraudulent nature of investment\nprograms involving \"prime bank\" financial instruments, like the Exo-\ndus Program. We conclude that Gormley's wire fraud conviction was\nsupported by the evidence.\n\nC. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Six, Money Laundering,\n        and Count Two, Money Laundering Conspiracy\n\nA money laundering conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1956 requires:\n\n        (1) that the defendant conduct a financial transaction with at\n        least a de minimis effect on interstate commerce; (2) that the\n        transaction involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful\n        activity; (3) that the defendant knew that those proceeds\n        were derived from that specific unlawful activity; and (4)\n        that the defendant engaged in the transaction intending to\n        promote that unlawful activity.\n\nUnited States v. France, 164 F.3d 203, 208 (4th Cir. 1998), cert.\ndenied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999); 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i). Funds\nare the proceeds of unlawful activity if they \"are derived from an\nalready completed offense, or a completed phase of an ongoing\noffense.\" United States v. Conley (Conley I), 37 F.3d 970, 980 (3d\nCir. 1994); see also United States v. Butler, 211 F.3d 826, 829 (4th\nCir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1091 (2001). \"This is true even if\nthe money laundering transaction can also be considered a part of the\ncontinuing specified unlawful activity.\" United States v. Morelli, 169\n\n                  15\n\fF.3d 798, 804 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 820 (1999). A defen-\ndant must have subjective knowledge that the funds were the proceeds\nof unlawful activity. United States v. Campbell, 977 F.2d 854, 857\n(4th Cir. 1992).\n\nGormley's money laundering conviction is based on the September\n20, 1995, transfer of $400,000 from Edwards' escrow account to Bol-\nlin's trust account in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Gormley drafted\na letter dated September 19, 1995, from Damron to Edwards directing\nEdwards to release the $400,000.1111 Gormley disputes only whether the\nGovernment proved that he knew the funds were the proceeds of\nfraud. Gormley argues that the evidence failed to establish that Gorm-\nley knew the Toumas had put up the $400,000, but instead established\nthat Gormley had been informed by Damron that the money came\nfrom Damron's profits from trading in Gold Eagle coins. There was\nsubstantial evidence, however, from which the jury could reasonably\ninfer that Gormley knew the $400,000 was the proceeds of fraud.\n\nIn July 1995, Damron discussed with Gormley the Exodus Program\ndocuments, foreign bank debenture trading programs, and foreign\ngrantor trusts. Damron testified that he wanted a foreign grantor trust\nbecause the money he planned to place in the Exodus Program would\nbe his clients' money: \"If I participated in the program, it would be\nwith money from my clients. So I felt that I should have control over\nit, I should have my own foreign grantor trust.\" Damron's client with\nregard to the $400,000 was Dr. Touma. To protect Dr. Touma's inter-\nest, Damron asked Gormley about designating beneficiaries of his for-\neign grantor trust:\n\n        Q: When did you have your discussion with Mr. Gormley\n        about foreign grantor -- beneficiaries of foreign\n        grantor trusts?\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11 Gormley suggests that the evidence showed that Damron drafted the\nrelease letter, not Gormley. We disagree. Damron testified on direct\nexamination that Gormley drafted the release letter, which Damron then\nsigned and sent to Edwards. Damron did not repudiate his testimony that\nGormley drafted the letter, but merely confirmed on cross examination\nthat he instructed Edwards in a letter that the $400,000 was to be trans-\nferred.\n\n                  16\n\f       A: That was -- would be just probably late July. It was\n       before Dr. Touma -- or maybe shortly thereafter--\n       when Dr. Touma was getting ready to make that large\n       investment, he was concerned that if I was okay, it was\n       okay, but what if something happened to me. He\n       wanted some protection for his money. And so I asked\n       Mr. Gormley what could we do.\n\n       Q: What did Mr. Gormley tell you?\n\n       A: Well, that's what we did. We set up that successor ben-\n       eficiary thing so that if something happened to me, it\n       was all spelled out who would get what percentage of\n       the money.\n\nThis testimony supports an inference that Gormley knew Dr. Touma\nhad contributed to the $400,000.\n\nFurther, Gormley confirmed in a letter dated July 24, 1995, that Dr.\nTouma was set up as the beneficiary of the trust. In the same letter,\nGormley mentioned that \"as to the investment matter we discussed,\"\nthe funds would be held in Gormley's escrow account pending receipt\nof documents and a bank guarantee. Damron testified that the \"invest-\nment matter\" was the placement of $400,000 into the Exodus Pro-\ngram. Gormley was aware that Damron had deposited the $400,000\nwith an escrow agent, Edwards, in preparation for the investment. At\nthis point, Gormley refused to give Damron the \"green light\" because\nno bank guarantee had yet been provided.\n\nA short time later, in August 1995, Gormley met with Agent\nCaruso of the FBI, who explained to Gormley the fraudulent nature\nof prime bank debenture trading programs. By this point, if not ear-\nlier, Gormley knew these debenture trading programs were fraudu-\nlent. Nonetheless, on September 13, 1995, in furtherance of a program\nhe knew was a scam, Gormley sent to Bollin the fax from Oles and\nHolcombe containing the wire coordinates to Oles' offshore Exodus\naccount, thereby participating in wire fraud.\n\nGormley then prepared and faxed a profit sharing agreement\nbetween Damron and Bollin, dated September 18, 1995. The agree-\n\n                  17\n\fment noted that \"Damron has introduced Bollin [sic] certain individu-\nals who have placed U.S. $400,000 in Escrow for investment.\" This\nagreement contemplated Damron and Bollin splitting profits of over\n$1.8 million per week. Gormley then prepared for Damron the Sep-\ntember 19, 1995, letter instructing Edwards to transfer the $400,000\nto Bollin's foreign grantor trust. The funds were transferred the next\nday.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence to establish that Gormley knew the\nExodus Program was a fraud, knew the $400,000 was being invested\nin this fraud, and knew he was facilitating the transfer of the funds\nto the perpetrators of this fraud. Furthermore, based on his knowledge\nthat Dr. Touma was the beneficiary of Damron's foreign grantor trust,\nthe reference to \"certain investors\" in the Bollin/Damron profit shar-\ning agreement, and Gormley's connections with and knowledge of the\nrelationships among Oles, Bollin, Damron, their offshore accounts,\nand the Exodus Program, the jury could reasonably infer that, at the\ntime Gormley participated in the transfer of the $400,000 to Bollin's\noffshore account, Gormley knew the money was the proceeds of fraud.12  12\nWe are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support Gorm-\nley's money laundering conviction.\n\nGormley raises the same arguments as to the sufficiency of the evi-\ndence on Count Two, the money laundering conspiracy charge. For\nthe same reasons, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport the jury's verdict.\n\nD. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Thirteen, False\n        Declarations before the Court\n\nGormley was convicted of making false declarations before the\ncourt under 18 U.S.C. § 1623(a), based on two allegedly false state-\nments that he made at an October 23, 1997, contempt hearing. In\n1997, after Damron was placed under investigation, a financial\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12 Thus, it is irrelevant whether Gormley, as an attorney, had a duty to\ninquire as to the source of his client's funds because he knew the\n$400,000 was the proceeds of fraud. Indeed, Gormley knew the $400,000\nwas the proceeds of a fraudulent scheme when he participated in wire\nfraud in furtherance of that scheme on September 13, 1995.\n\n                  18\n\frestraining order was issued against Damron. While that restraining\norder was in effect, approximately $400,000 was repaid to certain\ninvestors. When questioned about the $400,000 in repayments, Gorm-\nley testified as follows:\n\n       Q: And what is your understanding as to those disburse-\n       ments and how they occurred?\n\n       A: And I believe that those are the bank drafts that these\n       individuals received. And from everything I know, that\n       money was not Mr. Damron's money, he didn't own it,\n       he didn't control it.\n\n       And I don't know what this word \"expectancy interest\"\n       is in the Court's order, exactly what that means, but I\n       don't believe that Mr. Damron had any such interest in\n       that money.\n\n       Q: Did Roger A. Damron direct or coordinate or orches-\n       trate the disbursement of these funds to these individual\n       investors?\n\n       A: To my knowledge he did not.\n\nThe indictment alleged that at the time of his testimony, Gormley\nknew Damron had an interest in the $400,000 and knew Damron had\ncoordinated, orchestrated and directed the repayments. Gormley con-\ntends that his perjury conviction should be reversed because (1) there\nwas insufficient evidence to show that Gormley knew of Damron's\nrole in the repayment; (2) the examiner's questions before the grand\njury were fundamentally ambiguous and were insufficient as a matter\nof law to support a perjury conviction; and (3) his responses were lit-\nerally true.\n\nThe evidence was sufficient to show that, at the time of his testi-\nmony, Gormley knew of Damron's role in returning the money to the\ninvestors. Before any money was sent to the investors, Damron and\nGormley discussed who should be paid. Damron prepared a list of the\namounts due to the investors and sent the list to Gormley. The persons\n\n                  19\n\fon that list were the persons who were eventually paid. Further, dis-\ncovered in Gormley's office was a copy of a handwritten fax from\nDamron to Paul Dempsey in the Turks and Caicos Islands, directing\nthe repayment of money to the investors. The fax was dated August\n27, 1997, and a notation indicated that it was faxed \"before 10:30\nam.\" Damron testified that it was his practice to make a notation in\nthe upper right corner of a document when he faxed it. Moreover,\nbased on the presence of the notation on faxes that Gormley received\nfrom Damron, the jury could reasonably infer that Gormley was fully\naware of Damron's practice. Although Damron testified that Gormley\nrefused to forward to Dempsey the list of investors to be repaid and\nadvised Damron not to do it himself, there is sufficient evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that, at the time of his October 23, 1997, testi-\nmony, Gormley knew Damron had directed Dempsey to send the\nmoney to the investors.\n\nGormley argues that the examiner's question whether Damron \"di-\nrected, coordinated, or orchestrated\" the disbursement of funds to the\ninvestors was fundamentally unclear and impossible to answer, and\ntherefore an improper basis for a perjury charge. Gormley argues that\nthe question asked of him is like the question found insufficient to\nsupport a perjury conviction in United States v. Rendon-Marquez, 79\nF. Supp. 2d 1361 (N.D. Ga. 1999), aff'd mem., 228 F.3d 416 (11th\nCir. 2000). In Rendon-Marquez, the defendant was asked on an INS\nform, \"Have you knowingly committed any crime or offense, for\nwhich you have not been arrested; or have you been arrested, cited,\ncharged, indicted, convicted, fined, or imprisoned for breaking or vio-\nlating any law or ordinance, including traffic violations?\" The form\nprovided for only a \"yes\" or a \"no\" response. The defendant answered\nin the negative, but had once been arrested. The district court granted\na judgment of acquittal because it found the question to be a confus-\ning compound question that asked two separate and distinct questions,\nbut provided for only a yes/no response. Id. at 1363. The result was\nthat the defendant would give a partially false answer no matter how\nhe responded, making the defendant's response to the question an\nimproper basis for a perjury conviction. Id.\n\n\"[P]recise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense\nof perjury.\" Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352, 362 (1973).\nUnlike in Rendon-Marquez, Gormley was asked a single question, to\n\n                  20\n\fwhich he gave a fully false response. The question asked of Gormley\npresented three possibilities, all of which--direct, coordinate, and\norchestrate--are similar in meaning. All three refer to some conduct\non Damron's part intended to bring about the repayment of investors.\nThe evidence showed that Damron engaged in such conduct and that\nGormley knew Damron engaged in such conduct. We find the ques-\ntion to be perfectly intelligible.13\n                                  13 The question asked of Gormley was\nnot ambiguous or unanswerable, and the matter was properly submit-\nted to the jury. See United States v. Heater, 63 F.3d 311 (4th Cir.\n1995) (affirming a perjury conviction based on the defendant's false\nresponse to the question whether he had ever \"bought or sold mari-\njuana\" because the question did not contain any fundamental ambigu-\nity that would have prevented the jury from considering the question).\n\nGormley next argues that his response to the second question was\nliterally true because it was Oles, not Damron, who provided the\nfunds to be used for repayment. \"A literally true answer, even though\nunresponsive or `shrewdly calculated to evade,' cannot form the pred-\nicate for a perjury conviction.\" United States v. Sainz, 772 F.2d 559,\n563 (9th Cir. 1985) (quoting United States v. Cowley, 720 F.2d 1037,\n1042 (9th Cir. 1983)). However, \"`an answer that is responsive and\nfalse on its face does not come within [a] literal truth analysis simply\nbecause the defendant can postulate unstated premises of the question\nthat would make his answer literally true.'\" United States v. Ful-\nbright, 804 F.2d 847, 851 (5th Cir. 1986) (quoting United States v.\nCuesta, 597 F.2d 903, 920 (5th Cir. 1979)). Even though Oles pro-\nvided the $400,000, there was sufficient evidence to establish that\nDamron was the one who instructed Dempsey to repay certain inves-\ntors and how much to pay them. Gormley knew of Damron's role in\nthe repayment but testified to the contrary.14 14 Gormley's perjury con-\nviction is affirmed.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 Moreover, the question appears to have been perfectly intelligible to\nGormley. As his response to the first question indicates, when Gormley\ndid not understand a question or a term, he communicated his lack of\nunderstanding.\n\n14 We need not reach Gormley's argument that his response to the first\nquestion was literally true because his false response to the second ques-\ntion was sufficient to support his conviction. The jury was entitled to find\n\n                  21\n\fIII. TRIAL ERRORS\n\nBollin and Tietjen challenge several of the district court's evidenti-\nary rulings. Decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence are\ncommitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be\nreversed absent an abuse of discretion. United States v. Bostian, 59\nF.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir. 1995). Where a defendant fails to object to an\nasserted error at trial, the \"plain error\" standard applies. United States\nv. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-32 (1993); Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\nA. Attorney-Client Privilege\n\nBollin contends that Robert Edwards' testimony was admitted in\nviolation of Bollin's attorney-client privilege. The district court's\ndecision whether certain evidence is subject to the privilege is a\nmixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review. In re Grand\nJury Proceedings, 33 F.3d 342, 353 (4th Cir. 1994). The party claim-\ning the privilege bears the burden of demonstrating that: \"the\nattorney-client privilege applies; (2) the communications were pro-\ntected by the privilege; and (3) the privilege was not waived.\" United\nStates v. Aramony, 88 F.3d 1369, 1389 (4th Cir. 1996). Assuming that\nan attorney-client relationship existed between Bollin and Edwards,15  15\nBollin does not identify any particular testimony that allegedly was\nprivileged, but instead argues that Edwards should not have been\nallowed to testify at all. It is well-established, however, that the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nGormley guilty for either response because the United States charged in\nthe conjunctive, charging that Gormley falsely testified about whether\nDamron had an interest in the $400,000 and whether he had, in fact,\ncoordinated, orchestrated, and directed the repayment of investors. See\nTurner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 420 (1970) (reaffirming the \"gen-\neral rule\" that where an indictment charges several acts in the conjunc-\ntive, a guilty verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to\nany one of them); United States v. Sarihifard, 155 F.3d 301, 310 (4th Cir.\n1998) (applying the Turner rule to a perjury charge).\n\n15 The record shows that Bollin contacted Edwards to act as an escrow\nagent and not for the purpose of seeking legal advice. The district court\nassumed, without finding, that an attorney-client relationship existed\nbetween Bollin and Edwards.\n\n                    22\n\fattorney-client privilege protects only confidential communications\nmade for the purpose of seeking legal advice. E.g., United States v.\nTedder, 801 F.2d 1437, 1441-42 (4th Cir. 1986). The privilege does\nnot prevent an attorney from testifying as to non-confidential matters.\n\nMoreover, we agree with the district court that Bollin waived any\nprivilege that may have attached when he testified to the grand jury\nregarding the same transactions and communications about which\nEdwards testified. See United States v. Plache, 913 F.2d 1375, 1380\n(9th Cir. 1990) (finding a waiver of the attorney-client privilege\nwhere the defendant testified before the grand jury regarding his con-\nversations with counsel). The fact that Bollin was testifying before the\ngrand jury pursuant to a subpoena does not preclude effective waiver.\nSee id. The district court did not err in allowing Edwards to testify.\n\nB. Exclusion of Evidence of Oles' Flight\n\nBollin further contends that the district court abused its discretion\nby excluding evidence that co-defendant Stephen Oles absconded.\nBollin argues that the evidence of Oles' flight would have shown Oles\nto be a man who manipulated Bollin into participating in the events\nin this case, and would have been highly probative of Bollin's intent.\nAlthough a co-defendant's flight may be relevant to show the guilt of\nthat defendant, see United States v. Porter, 821 F.2d 968 (4th Cir.\n1987), it does not tend to show that another defendant is innocent, at\nleast not where, as here, there can be more than one guilty party. See\nUnited States v. Ortland, 109 F.3d 539, 545 (9th Cir. 1997). Further,\nany probative value of Oles' flight was substantially outweighed by\nthe danger of confusing the issues where Oles was not being tried\nwith the rest of the defendants. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. The district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion.\n\nC. Admission of Bollin's Grand Jury Testimony\n\nBollin contends that the district court abused its discretion when it\nallowed the Government to present a redacted version of his grand\njury testimony but refused to allow him to present the omitted por-\ntions under the rule of completeness or the former testimony excep-\ntion to the hearsay rule. We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n                  23\n\f1. Former Testimony Exception\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1) provides an exception to the\nhearsay rule for the former testimony of a declarant where the declar-\nant is unavailable as a witness.16\n                                 16 A declarant is \"unavailable\" when\nthe declarant \"is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of\nprivilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declar-\nant's statement.\" Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)(1). Bollin contends that he was\n\"unavailable\" because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.\n\nA criminal defendant who invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege\nmakes himself unavailable to any other party. United States v. Bum-\npass, 60 F.3d 1099, 1102 (4th Cir. 1995). Rule 804(a) provides, how-\never, that \"[a] declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption,\nrefusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the\nprocurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the\npurpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.\" Fed.\nR. Evid. 804(a). By invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege, Bollin\nmade himself unavailable for the purpose of preventing his testimony,\nand he therefore cannot invoke the exception in Rule 804(b)(1).\nAccord United States v. Peterson, 100 F.3d 7, 13 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(holding that a defendant who exercises his privilege not to testify at\na second trial of his case is not entitled to introduce the testimony he\ngave at the first trial); United States v. Kimball, 15 F.3d 54, 55-56\n(5th Cir. 1994) (same).\n\n2. Rule of Completeness\n\nThe \"rule of completeness\" is found in Federal Rule of Evidence\n106, which provides:\n\n        When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is\n        introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16 Bollin also argues that his grand jury statements are not hearsay. His\nstatements to the grand jury were made out of court, and Bollin would\nintroduce them to prove the truth of the matter asserted. They are hear-\nsay. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). The statements were admissible by the\nGovernment as admissions under Rule 801(d)(2).\n\n                  24\n\f       introduction at that time of any other part or any other writ-\n       ing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be con-\n       sidered contemporaneously with it.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 106. The purpose of the rule is \"to prevent a party from\nmisleading the jury by allowing into the record relevant portions of\nthe excluded testimony which clarify or explain the part already\nreceived.\" United States v. Wilkerson, 84 F.3d 692, 696 (4th Cir.\n1996). The portions of the excluded testimony thus must be relevant\nto an issue in the case, and the court need only admit the portions that\nare necessary to clarify or explain the portion of the testimony already\nadmitted. Id.\n\nBollin identifies several portions of his grand jury testimony that\nhe contends should have been admitted under Rule 106. We have\nreviewed Bollin's grand jury testimony as admitted and his unredac-\nted grand jury testimony. Like the district court, we conclude that the\nomitted testimony was not necessary to avoid misleading the jury or\notherwise place the admitted testimony in context. The fact that some\nof the omitted testimony arguably was exculpatory does not, without\nmore, make it admissible under the rule of completeness.\n\nD. Admission of Tietjen's Grand Jury Testimony\n\nThe Government introduced against Tietjen a redacted version of\nhis grand jury testimony. Because Tietjen did not raise at trial his\nobjections to the admission of his grand jury testimony, the plain error\nstandard of review applies. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 731-32.\n\nTietjen first argues that his grand jury testimony was taken in vio-\nlation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and\ntherefore should not have been admitted. His claim is foreclosed by\nUnited States v. Washington, 431 U.S. 181, 188 (1977). Like in\nWashington, after being sworn, Tietjen was explicitly advised that he\nhad the right not to incriminate himself and that if any questions\ntended to incriminate him, he had the right under the Fifth Amend-\nment not to answer the question. He was advised that anything he said\ncould be used against him by the grand jury or in subsequent legal\nproceedings, and was advised of his right to counsel. The Government\ncorrectly and completely answered Tietjen's later questions regarding\n\n                  25\n\fhis Fifth Amendment privilege. These warnings eliminated any possi-\nble compulsion to self-incrimination. See id. at 188. Whether Tietjen\nwas a target of the grand jury investigation is irrelevant under Wash-\nington. See id. at 189; United States v. Goodwin, 57 F.3d 815, 818-19\n(9th Cir. 1995).\n\nTietjen also maintains that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nhad attached at the time of his grand jury testimony. But at the time\nTietjen testified to the grand jury, no adversary judicial proceedings\nagainst him had yet been initiated. See United States v. Gouveia, 467\nU.S. 180, 187 (1984) (\"[The Sixth Amendment] right to counsel\nattaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceed-\nings against the defendant.\"). The Government's warnings to Teitjen\nregarding his Fifth Amendment rights do not show that a prosecution\nhad commenced. Indeed, no indictment was returned against Tietjen\nuntil over one year after he testified to the grand jury. His Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel thus had not yet attached.\n\nTietjen further contends that his redacted grand jury testimony,\nread at trial, was not sufficiently complete under the \"rule of com-\npleteness.\" Tietjen's grand jury testimony was redacted to remove all\nreferences to co-defendant Stanie Benz in order to comply with the\nrule in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). Benz entered a\nplea on the day before trial and then testified against Tietjen. The\nredacted version of Tietjen's testimony nonetheless was introduced.\nHowever, the omitted portions of Tietjen's testimony were not neces-\nsary to avoid misleading the jury or to clarify or explain any portion\nof the admitted testimony, and the rule of completeness does not\nrequire the court to admit Tietjen's complete grand jury testimony\nsolely because some portions might be exculpatory. See Wilkerson, 84\nF.3d at 696. Moreover, Tietjen suffered no prejudice. Stanie Benz tes-\ntified at trial, and Tietjen had full opportunity to cross examine her.\nThe district court did not err.\n\nIV. SENTENCING\n\nThe district court's factual findings underlying sentencing enhance-\nments are reviewed for clear error. The district court's legal interpre-\ntations are reviewed de novo. United States v. Akinkoye, 185 F.3d\n192, 201 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1177 (2000).\n\n                  26\n\fA. Two-Level Enhancement for Abuse of a Position of Trust\n\nBoth Bollin and Tietjen appeal the district court's application of a\ntwo-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 for abuse of a posi-\ntion of trust. Under § 3B1.3, a defendant's sentence is increased by\ntwo levels \"if [the district court] determines that the defendant abused\na position of trust and that abuse significantly contributed to the com-\nmission or concealment of the crime.\" Id. at 203; U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3.\n\"Whether a defendant occupied a position of trust warranting a two-\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 is a factual determination\nreviewable for clear error.\" United States v. Glymph, 96 F.3d 722, 727\n(4th Cir. 1996).\n\nWhether a defendant held a position of trust must be \"approached\nfrom the perspective of the victim.\" United States v. Gordon, 61 F.3d\n263, 269 (4th Cir. 1995). Thus, the § 3B1.3 adjustment may be\napplied \"in a case in which the defendant provides sufficient indicia\nto the victim that the defendant legitimately holds a position of pri-\nvate or public trust when, in fact, the defendant does not.\" U.S.S.G.\n§ 3B1.3, cmt. n.2; see also United States v. Queen, 4 F.3d 925, 929\n(10th Cir. 1993) (holding that the § 3B1.3 enhancement may apply to\nimposters). In the case of an imposter, it is not merely the defendant's\nmisrepresentation that justifies the § 3B1.3 enhancement. In every\ncase of fraud, the defendant will have created confidence and trust in\nthe victim. But fraud alone does not justify the enhancement. We\nmust \"carefully distinguish between those arms-length commercial\nrelationships where trust is created by the defendant's personality or\nthe victim's credulity, and relationships in which the victim's trust is\nbased on the defendant's position in the transaction.\" United States v.\nKoehn, 74 F.3d 199, 201 (10th Cir. 1996). Section 3B1.3 penalizes\ndefendants who take advantage of a position that provides them with\nthe \"freedom to commit a `difficult-to-detect wrong.'\" United States\nv. Moore, 29 F.3d 175, 179 (4th Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v.\nHill, 915 F.2d 502, 506 (9th Cir. 1990)).\n\nTietjen argues that he does not qualify for the § 3B1.3 enhance-\nment because he did not have a trust relationship with the investors\nand because the enhancement may not be applied by imputing to him\na co-conspirator's abuse of a position of trust. The district court\napplied the enhancement based on Tietjen's own abuse of a position\n\n                  27\n\fof trust; the court did not impute to him Benz's alleged abuse of a\nposition of trust. See Moore, 29 F.3d at 179 (holding that one co-\nconspirator's abuse of a position of trust is not attributable to another\nco-conspirator). The district court found that Tietjen falsely held him-\nself out as having a high level of skill and experience in debentures\ntrading. Although it was Benz who actually solicited the investors,\nTietjen caused the impression that he was a legitimate, experienced\ndebentures trader to be passed on to the ultimate investors to induce\nthem to invest. See Queen, 4 F.3d at 930 (affirming an enhancement\nunder § 3B1.3 where the defendant caused his employees to hold him\nout as a legitimate investment advisor/broker). In entrusting Tietjen\nwith their money, the investors provided Tietjen with the discretion\nto invest on their behalf and expected Tietjen to make trades in their\nbest interest, which he did not do. See United States v. Davuluri, 239\nF.3d 902, 909 (7th Cir. 2001) (noting that what distinguishes situa-\ntions in which § 3B1.3 should apply is \"whether the defendant has\nbroad discretion to act on behalf of the victim and the victim believes\nthe defendant will act in the victim's best interest\"). The district court\ndid not clearly err in finding that Tietjen had abused a position of trust\njustifying an enhancement under § 3B1.3.\n\nBollin also argues that the district court erred in applying the\n§ 3B1.3 enhancement to him because he did not actually possess any\nspecialized knowledge and did not actually assume a position of trust\nvis-a-vis the victims. The district court found that although Bollin\nmay have lacked the specialized knowledge of an actual investment\nbroker, Bollin represented that he knew about debentures trading pro-\ngrams, knew their track record, and had experience investing in them.\nBollin held himself out as experienced in debentures trading and\ncaused that impression to be extended to the ultimate investors. Bollin\nrepresented that he was the \"broker\" in the investment program, and\nthe investors' funds were entrusted to him when they were transferred\nto his offshore trust account. Bollin demonstrated that, as far as the\ninvestors were concerned, he was vested with discretionary authority\nover their money when he falsely claimed to have \"frozen\" the funds\nin order to protect them. Bollin used his position as the \"broker\" in\nthe transaction to lull the investors into delaying going to the authori-\nties or suing to recoup their losses. Although Bollin also falsely repre-\nsented that he was a co-investor in the debentures trading program,\nwe cannot say the district court clearly erred in finding that Bollin\n\n                  28\n\foccupied and abused a position of trust justifying the § 3B1.3\nenhancement.\n\nB. Two-Level Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\n\nTietjen contends that the district court erred by applying a two-\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice.\nBecause Tietjen failed to raise his objection at sentencing, we review\nfor plain error. See United States v. Kinter, 235 F.3d 192, 199 (4th\nCir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1393 (2001). The district court did\nnot err. Tietjen was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice under\n18 U.S.C. § 1503. The applicable Guideline for obstruction of justice\nis § 2J1.2. Note 3 of the § 2J1.2 Commentary provides: \"In the event\nthe defendant is convicted under this section as well as for the under-\nlying offense (i.e., the offense that is the object of the obstruction),\nsee the Commentary to Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction), and to\n§ 3D1.2(c) (Groups of Closely Related Conduct).\" U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2,\ncmt. n.3. Tietjen argues that Note 7 of § 3C1.1 governs his sentence\nand precludes the enhancement. We disagree. Because Tietjen was\nalso convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering,\nthe offenses with respect to which the obstruction conduct occurred,\nNote 8 governs. Note 8 provides:\n\n        If the defendant is convicted both of an obstruction offense\n        . . . and an underlying offense (the offense with respect to\n        which the obstruction conduct occurred), the count for the\n        obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the\n        underlying offense under subsection (c) of § 3D1.2 . . . . The\n        offense level for that group of closely related counts will be\n        the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the\n        2-level adjustment specified by this section. . . .\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, cmt. n.8. The enhancement for obstruction of jus-\ntice was proper.\n\nC. Relevant Conduct\n\nTietjen contends that the district court erred by using $2.4 million\nas the relevant conduct amount in the Guidelines calculations for\n\n                   29\n\fCounts One and Two. Tietjen objects to the inclusion of $1 million\nthat he never actually received because the funds were returned to\nBenz by Dean Witter, who refused to complete the transfer.17    17 Tietjen,\nhowever, expected to receive the $1 million from Benz. He did not\nactually receive the funds only because the bank refused to complete\nthe transfer. The $1 million thus was properly attributed to Tietjen.\nFurther, there is no error in the district court's calculation under\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), because Tietjen's\nsentence--60 months on Count One and 135 months on Count Two\nto run concurrently--did not exceed the statutory maximums. See 18\nU.S.C. § 371 (maximum 5 years); 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), (h) (maximum\n20 years); Kinter, 235 F.3d at 199-200 (recognizing that the Apprendi\nholding is limited to factual determinations that increase the penalty\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, and holding\nthat the prescribed statutory maximum is found by looking to the lan-\nguage of the statute criminalizing the offense). The district court did\nnot err.\n\nD. $1.2 Million Forfeiture Judgment\n\nGormley contends that his $1.2 million forfeiture judgment violates\nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. This court considers de novo whether a forfeiture\nis a constitutionally excessive fine. United States v. Bajakajian, 524\nU.S. 321, 336-37 (1998). The burden is on the party challenging the\nconstitutionality of the forfeiture to demonstrate its excessiveness.\nUnited States v. Ahmad, 213 F.3d 805, 813 (4th Cir.), cert. denied,\n121 S. Ct. 573 (2000). \"[A] punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive\nFines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defen-\ndant's offense.\" Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 334. To determine the pro-\nportionality of a forfeiture, a court should consider \"the nature and\nextent of the criminal activity, its relation to other crimes, its penal-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17 Tietjen also objects to the inclusion of a $250,000 sum that was also\nreturned to Benz by the bank. Because the threshold for the relevant con-\nduct is $2 million, see U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(G), and the district court\nattributed to Tietjen $2.4 million, only the $1 million sum could affect\nTietjen's sentence. We therefore do not reach his challenge to the inclu-\nsion of the $250,000.\n\n                   30\n\fties, and the harm it caused.\" Ahmad, 213 F.3d at 813; see also\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. at 337-40.\n\nGormley argues that his $1.2 million forfeiture judgment is exces-\nsive under United States v. Van Brocklin, 115 F.3d 587 (8th Cir.\n1997), in which the Eighth Circuit held that a forfeiture judgment of\nover $1.3 million against a defendant who played a secondary role in\nthe fraudulent scheme violated the Excessive Fines Clause. Id. at 601-\n02. Gormley argues that his forfeiture judgment is excessive in light\nof his minor role in the money laundering activities, the small per-\nsonal benefit that he received, approximately $30,000 in legal fees,\nand his lesser culpability compared to that of the other defendants.\n\nIn United States v. Bajakajian, the defendant pleaded guilty to fail-\nure to report exported currency in the amount of $357,144. 524 U.S.\nat 337. Although 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) required forfeiture of the\nentire amount involved in the offense, the Supreme Court concluded\nthat forfeiture of the entire $357,144 violated the Excessive Fines\nClause because the amount of the forfeiture was grossly dispropor-\ntional to the gravity of the defendant's offense. Id. The defendant's\ncrime was \"solely a reporting offense,\" and his violation was \"unre-\nlated to any other unlawful activities.\" Id. at 337-38. Although the\nmaximum statutory sentence was five years and/or a $250,000 fine,\nthe maximum sentence that could have been imposed on the defen-\ndant under the Sentencing Guidelines was six months and a $5,000\nmaximum fine, thus indicating a minimal level of culpability. Id. at\n338. Moreover, the defendant caused only minimal harm, merely\ndepriving the government of information, but causing no loss to the\npublic fisc. Id. The gravity of the defendant's offense thus was low,\nwhile the amount of the forfeiture was very high. Id. at 339-40. The\nforfeiture of the entire $357,144 therefore violated the Excessive\nFines Clause. Id. at 340.\n\nAfter considering the factors set forth in Bajakajian, we are satis-\nfied that Gormley's $1.2 million forfeiture judgment is not grossly\ndisproportional to the gravity of his offense.18\n                                              18 Unlike in Bajakajian,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18 Gormley's forfeiture was imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the\nsame provision at issue in Bajakajian, and as part of his criminal sen-\ntence. Thus, there is no question that the forfeiture ordered against Gor-\nmley is punitive and therefore subject to analysis under the Excessive\nFines Clause.\n\n                   31\n\fthe nature of Gormley's criminal activity in this case was not merely\na reporting violation. Gormley was involved in money laundering,\nand the money laundering arose out of and involved a continuing\nsecurities fraud scheme that defrauded multiple investors out of mil-\nlions of dollars. See Ahmad, 213 F.3d at 817 (finding the defendant's\nreporting offense to be serious in part because it was part of a larger\ncustoms fraud scheme). The forfeiture judgment was not based on a\nsingle occurrence of money laundering. Instead, the defendants con-\nducted multiple transactions over a period of nearly two years. Fur-\nther, the statutory maximum for Gormley's offense was twenty years\nand/or a $500,000 fine, thus indicating that Congress has found the\noffense to be serious. See Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 336 (noting that\n\"judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong\nin the first instance to the legislature\"). Under the Sentencing Guide-\nlines, Gormley faced a sentence of ninety-seven to 121 months and\na $500,000 fine. See U.S. Sent. Guidelines Manual, Sent. Table.\nAlthough the district court found Gormley eligible for a reduction in\nhis sentence based on his \"minor role\" in the offense, the significant\npenalties Gormley faced demonstrate the gravity of his offense.\n\nMoreover, although Gormley received only about $30,000, he is\nliable in a forfeiture judgment for the foreseeable criminal conduct of\nhis co-conspirators. See United States v. McHan, 101 F.3d 1027, 1043\n(4th Cir. 1996); United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir. 1995);\nsee also United States v. Gormley, 176 F.3d 476, 1999 WL 212008\n(4th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (unpublished) (affirming in Gormley's\ninterlocutory appeal the district court's ruling that Gormley may be\nheld jointly and severally liable for any forfeitable assets possessed\nby his co-defendants). As the First Circuit has noted, \"holding a\ndefendant liable for an amount of money foreseeably laundered by\nhimself and his own co-conspirators is quite rational based on a pro-\nportionality analysis.\" Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23. In light of the extent of\nthe money laundering, its relationship to the securities fraud scheme,\nand the harm caused, Gormley's $1.2 million forfeiture judgment is\nnot excessive.\n\nE. $783,545 in Restitution\n\nGormley contends that the order to pay restitution in the amount of\n$783,545 violates the Excessive Fines Clause based on the same argu-\n\n                  32\n\fments that he raised regarding his forfeiture judgment. For the same\nreasons that Gormley's forfeiture judgment is not excessive, we find\nthat the restitution order is not excessive.\n\nGormley also argues that remand is in order because the district\ncourt failed to make factual findings that Gormley has, or may have,\nan ability to pay restitution. Under the Victim and Witness Protection\nAct (VWPA), the sentencing court must make specific factual find-\nings with respect to a defendant's financial resources, financial needs,\nand earning abilities before ordering restitution. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3663(a) (1994); United States v. Karam, 201 F.3d 320, 329 (4th Cir.\n2000). In his reply brief, Gormley suggests for the first time that the\ndistrict court ordered restitution pursuant to the Mandatory Victims\nRestitution Act of 1996 (MVRA). The MVRA amended the VWPA\nby requiring sentencing courts to impose \"full\" restitution without\nconsidering the defendant's economic circumstances. See 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3663A, 3664(f)(1)(A) (Supp. V 1999); Karam, 201 F.3d at 330.\nUnder the VWPA, the court must first consider the defendant's finan-\ncial situation before determining the amount of restitution to be paid.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a) (1994). Because Gormley's restitution was\nbased on criminal activity that occurred before the MVRA's effective\ndate, Gormley contends that application of the MVRA would violate\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.19   19\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 The MVRA provides that it \"shall, to the extent constitutionally per-\nmissible, be effective for sentencing proceedings in cases in which the\ndefendant is convicted on or after [April 24, 1996].\" 18 U.S.C. § 2248,\nstatutory notes. The circuits are split on whether applying the MVRA to\ncriminal conduct committed before the MVRA's enactment violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. Compare United States v. Edwards, 162 F.3d 87\n(3d Cir. 1998) (holding that applying the MVRA to criminal conduct\ncommitted before the MVRA's enactment violates the Ex Post Facto\nClause); United States v. Siegel, 153 F.3d 1256, 1259-61 (11th Cir. 1998)\n(same); United States v. Williams, 128 F.3d 1239, 1241 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(same); United States v. Baggett, 125 F.3d 1319, 1322 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(same); United States v. Thompson, 113 F.3d 13, 15 n.1 (2d Cir. 1997)\n(same); with United States v. Nichols, 169 F.3d 1255, 1279-80 (10th Cir.)\n(holding that restitution is not criminal punishment for the purposes of\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 934 (1999); United\nStates v. Newman, 144 F.3d 531, 538-40 (7th Cir. 1998) (same). This cir-\ncuit has not yet decided the issue.\n\n                  33\n\fAssuming without deciding that the district court was required to\napply the VWPA, Gormley failed to object to the district court's\nalleged failure to make the required findings at the time of sentencing.\nBecause Gormley failed to object at sentencing, we review only for\nplain error.20\n             20 See Karam, 201 F.3d at 330. We conclude that Gormley\nhas failed to show that the alleged lack of factual findings prejudiced\nhis rights in any way.\n\nA sentencing court \"satisfies its duty [under the VWPA] to make\nspecific findings if it adopts a presentence report`that contains ade-\nquate factual findings to allow effective appellate review of the fine\nor restitution.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Castner, 50 F.3d 1267,\n1277 (4th Cir. 1995)). The district court adopted the factual findings\nof Gormley's presentence report (PSR). The PSR indicates that Gor-\nmley is well-educated and industrious. Gormley obtained scholarships\nfor his preparatory and college education. He worked his way through\ncollege and law school. Although Gormley likely will lose his law\nlicense as a result of his conviction and will no longer have earning\npotential as a lawyer, the loss of his license does not render him com-\npletely unable to earn a living, particularly because Gormley is well-\neducated, is in good health, and has no history of substance abuse.\nThe PSR recommended that an installment plan be established so that\nGormley could pay a restitution obligation, which the district court\nordered. Moreover, Gormley does not explain how, or even whether,\nthe district court's restitution order would have been different had the\ncourt made factual findings. See Castner, 50 F.3d at 1278 (noting that\nunder the plain error standard, appellants bear the burden of proof\nwith respect to prejudice of their rights); 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d) (1994)\n(\"The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defen-\ndant and the financial needs of the defendant and such defendant's\ndependents shall be on the defendant.\"). The PSR contained sufficient\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20 In order to correct plain error, four conditions must be met: (1) there\nmust be an error; (2) the error must be plain, meaning obvious or, at a\nminimum, clear under current law; (3) the error must affect substantial\nrights; and (4) the reviewing court must determine if the error \"seriously\naffects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed-\nings.\" United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993); see also Cast-\nner, 50 F.3d at 1277. \"Appellants bear the burden of proof with respect\nto prejudice of their rights.\" Id. at 1278 (citing Olano, 507 U.S at 735).\n\n                  34\n\ffacts to support the imposition of restitution. Gormley fails to demon-\nstrate a probability that the amount of restitution would have been dif-\nferent had the court made specific findings regarding his ability to\npay.\n\nGormley also argues that the district court violated the requirement\nin United States v. Johnson, 48 F.3d 806, 808-09 (4th Cir. 1995), that\nthe district court retain authority over restitution orders. At sentenc-\ning, the district court ordered the full amount of restitution payable in\nmonthly installments. The district court also ordered that Gormley's\n\"ability to pay restitution will be reassessed by the probation officer\nafter his release from custody. And if a modification is in order, report\nthat modification to this Court for action.\" The court clearly stated\nthat the probation officer should report to the court, but that the court\nwould take any action. Thus, the court \"retained both the right to\nreview the probation officer's findings and to exercise ultimate\nauthority regarding the payment of restitution.\" United States v.\nDawkins, 202 F.3d 711, 717 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1121\n(2000). The district court did not improperly delegate its authority.\nGormley's restitution order is affirmed.\n\nF. Use of IRA Funds to Retain Appellate Counsel\n\nGormley's assets were subject to a restraining order that required\nhim to obtain court permission for expenditures beyond ordinary liv-\ning expenses. After he was convicted, Gormley asked the court for\npermission to spend $80,000 from his individual retirement account\n(IRA) to retain appellate counsel. Gormley argued that the funds in\nhis IRA were protected from levy under Georgia law. The district\ncourt denied Gormley's request, holding that the funds in Gormley's\nIRA were potentially subject to forfeiture as substitute assets under 18\nU.S.C. § 982(b)(1), which incorporates the substitute asset provision\nof 21 U.S.C. § 853(p), and that the protections for IRAs provided by\nGeorgia law would not extend to IRA funds subject to criminal forfei-\nture. Gormley appeals the district court's denial of his motion. The\ndistrict court's order is an order denying modification of an injunc-\ntion, which we review for an abuse of discretion. See United States\nv. Snepp, 897 F.2d 138, 141 (4th Cir. 1990). We conclude that the dis-\ntrict court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n                  35\n\fGormley's forfeiture judgment was entered pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 982(a)(1). Section 982(b)(1) incorporates the forfeiture provisions\nof 21 U.S.C. § 853. Under § 853(p), where the property initially sub-\nject to forfeiture is unavailable, the government may forfeit substitute\nassets:\n\n       If any of the property described in subsection (a) of this sec-\n       tion, as a result of any act or omission of the defendant--\n\n       (1) cannot be located upon the exercise of due dili-\n       gence;\n\n       (2) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited\n       with, a third party;\n\n       (3) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the\n       court;\n\n       (4) has been substantially diminished in value; or\n\n       (5) has been commingled with other property\n       which cannot be divided without difficulty;\n\n       the court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of\n       the defendant up to the value of any property described in\n       paragraphs (1) through (5).\n\n21 U.S.C. § 853(p). In money laundering cases, § 982(b)(2) places a\nnarrow limitation on the forfeiture of substitute assets by protecting\nagainst forfeiture a defendant who \"acted merely as an intermediary\nwho handled but did not retain\" the laundered funds, unless the defen-\ndant conducted \"three or more separate transactions involving a total\nof $100,000 or more in any twelve month period.\" 18 U.S.C.\n§ 982(b)(2).\n\nThe Government has not yet moved to amend Gormley's forfeiture\njudgment to forfeit substitute assets. The order that Gormley appeals\nis an order leaving in place a restraining order under 21 U.S.C.\n§ 853(e), not an order forfeiting Gormley's IRA funds. Under\n\n                  36\n\f§ 853(e), the district court may issue a restraining order to preserve\nthe availability of the assets for forfeiture, \"based on a finding of\nprobable cause to believe that the assets are forfeitable.\" United States\nv. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600, 615 (1989); 21 U.S.C.§ 853(e); see also\nIn re Billman, 915 F.2d 916, 919 (4th Cir. 1990). The probable cause\nfound by the grand jury satisfies the government's burden of proving\nthe allegations of the indictment. Id. This court has held that the pre-\ntrial restraint provision of the RICO forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1963(d), permits the restraint of substitute assets under § 1963(m)\npending resolution of the defendant's case. Id. at 921. The restraint\nand substitute assets provisions of § 853 are identical to those in the\nRICO statute, and we see no reason to construe them differently. See\nid. (noting that \"[§ 853] and RICO forfeiture statutes should be simi-\nlarly construed\"). Gormley's substitute assets thus were subject to\nrestraint to preserve their availability for forfeiture pending the out-\ncome of his case.\n\nThe jury found Gormley liable for forfeiture of $1.2 million, and\nthe indictment included a notice to seek substitute assets.21\n                                                            21 There is\nprobable cause to believe that at least a significant portion of the $1.2\nmillion in laundered funds is no longer available; the funds were\ntransferred to overseas accounts beyond the jurisdiction of the district\ncourt and were used to repay investors and other individuals. As a\nmember of a conspiracy, Gormley is vicariously liable for the reason-\nably foreseeable conduct of his co-conspirators, both substantively\nand at sentencing. See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1042-43; Hurley, 63 F.3d\nat 23. His substitute assets thus may be subject to forfeiture in the\nevent the laundered funds are determined to be unavailable. See id.\n(affirming the forfeiture of substitute assets where the defendants\nwere held vicariously liable for a $136 million forfeiture based on the\nreasonably foreseeable money laundering activities of their co-\nconspirators). Gormley argues that he was merely an intermediary and\nis therefore entitled to the benefit of the safe harbor provided by\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21 We reject Gormley's argument that his IRA is not subject to forfei-\nture because it was not included in the indictment's list of proposed sub-\nstitute assets. The indictment did not purport to set out an exhaustive list\nof substitute assets, but instead set out a list\"including but not limited\nto\" certain identified assets. See United States v. Moffitt, Swerling &\nKemler, P.C., 83 F.3d 660, 664 (4th Cir. 1996).\n\n                  37\n\f§ 982(b)(2). Gormley did not raise this argument before the district\ncourt, however, and we decline to address it at this time. We leave it\nto the district court to address this argument and make the appropriate\nfindings if and when the Government moves for an order to forfeit\nGormley's substitute assets.\n\nGormley further argues, however, that the district court should\nhave released his IRA funds because Georgia law insulates all but\n25% of the funds from forfeiture. Under Georgia Code § 18-4-22,\nfunds in an IRA are \"exempt from the process of garnishment until\npaid . . . . Such funds or benefits, when paid . . ., shall be exempt from\nthe process of garnishment only to the extent provided in Code Sec-\ntion 18-4-20 for other disposable earnings, unless a greater exemption\nis otherwise provided by law.\" Ga. Code Ann.§18-4-22. Section 18-\n4-20 limits the garnishment to 25%. Ga. Code Ann.§ 18-4-20. We\nhave found no federal or state case applying § 18-4-22 to a criminal\nforfeiture, and Gormley provides no such authority. As the district\ncourt noted, the cases that address §§ 18-4-20 and 18-4-22 discuss\nshielding an IRA from a creditor attempting to collect a debt. See,\ne.g., Davis v. Davis, 288 S.E.2d 748 (Ga. Ct. App. 1982); Cooper v.\nAtlanta Policemen's Pension Fund, 249 S.E.2d 684 (Ga. Ct. App.\n1978). Gormley's forfeiture judgment is not merely a debt, but is part\nof his criminal sentence. See 18 U.S.C.§ 982(a)(1) (instructing the\ncourt to order forfeiture of property involved in the offense \"in impos-\ning sentence\" on a person convicted of a money laundering offense).\n\nMoreover, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Con-\nstitution, Georgia law could not insulate Gormley's assets from forfei-\nture to the extent that federal law provides otherwise. A state law is\npreempted to the extent that it conflicts with federal law. Silkwood v.\nKerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 248 (1984). In making the determi-\nnation of whether state law conflicts with federal law, \"the test to\napply is whether `it is impossible to comply with both state and fed-\neral law' or whether `the state law stands as an obstacle to the accom-\nplishment of the full purposes and objectives' of the relevant federal\nlaw.\" National Home Equity Mortgage Ass'n v. Face, 239 F.3d 633,\n637 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Silkwood, 464 U.S. at 248).\n\nAs noted above, a forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. § 982 is ordered as\npart of a defendant's sentence for a federal money laundering convic-\n\n                   38\n\ftion. See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1). Federal sentencing laws supersede\nstate laws that purport to place limits on a federal defendant's crimi-\nnal sentence when federal law provides otherwise. See United States\nv. Daniels, 929 F.2d 128, 130 (4th Cir. 1991) (noting that under the\nSupremacy Clause, state law could not prevent consideration of juve-\nnile proceedings by a federal court in determining a sentence, when\nfederal law provides otherwise).\n\nFurther, under federal law, the funds in Gormley's IRA may be for-\nfeited in their entirety. Section 982(a)(1) states that \"any property,\nreal or personal, involved in\" the money laundering offense, without\nlimitation or qualification, is subject to forfeiture. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 982(a)(1) (emphasis added). The statute makes no allowance for\nproperty protected by state law. Similarly, the substitute assets provi-\nsion provides that the court \"shall order the forfeiture of any other\nproperty up to the value of\" the initially forfeited property, in the\nevent the original property is unavailable. 21 U.S.C. § 853(p) (empha-\nsis added); 18 U.S.C. § 982(b)(1). Congress requires the forfeiture of\nany other property as substitute assets and again makes no allowance\nfor protections offered under state law. Cf. United States v. Lot 5, 23\nF.3d 359, 363 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that because 21 U.S.C.\n§ 881(a)(7) makes no exception for property protected by state law,\nthe Florida homestead exemption does not protect real property from\nforfeiture under federal law). As this court has recognized, the substi-\ntute assets provision in § 853(p) \"was enacted to make the govern-\nment's forfeiture efforts more effective.\" United States v. Moffitt,\nSwerling & Kemler, P.C., 83 F.3d 660, 669 (4th Cir. 1996). Because\nGeorgia law would insulate all but 25% of a defendant's IRA funds\nfrom forfeiture while federal law provides for full forfeiture, Georgia\nlaw conflicts with federal law and \"stands as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment of the full purposes and objectives\" of the federal\nmoney laundering forfeiture laws.\n\nAlthough state law \"has traditionally been relied upon to resolve\nquestions of property rights and interests arising under [the forfeiture\nlaws],\" once a defendant's property interest has been identified, fed-\neral forfeiture law determines whether the property may be forfeited.\nId. at 670; accord United States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th\nCir. 1999) (holding that 21 U.S.C. § 853(a) applies \"irrespective of\nany provision of state law\"), cert. denied , 121 S. Ct. 77 (2000);\n\n                  39\n\fUnited States v. 18755 North Bay Road, 13 F.3d 1493, 1498 (11th\nCir. 1994) (holding that federal forfeiture law preempts the Florida\nhomestead exemption); United States v. Curtis, 965 F.2d 610, 616\n(8th Cir. 1992) (holding that § 853(a) supersedes the Iowa homestead\nexemption); see also United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677 (1983)\n(holding that federal tax collection laws supersede state homestead\nlaws); United States v. Allen, 247 F.3d 741, 794 (8th Cir. 2001)\n(\"[W]e think the legal principles are clear that state law determines\nwhether a property interest exists in the first instance, but federal law\ndetermines whether and how that property may be attached.\"). Indeed,\nto hold otherwise would virtually destroy the uniformity of applica-\ntion of the money laundering forfeiture laws and would interfere with\nCongress' intent. See Curtis, 965 F.2d at 616-17. We conclude that\nfederal forfeiture law supersedes Georgia's statutory protections for\nIRAs. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to\nmodify its restraining order.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the convictions and sentences\nof appellants Gormley, Bollin, and Tietjen. We also affirm the district\ncourt's order denying Gormley permission to spend funds from his\nIRA pending the outcome of his case.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                  40\n\f",

Betts, United States Attorney, Charleston, West Virginia,\nfor Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nHALL, Senior Circuit Judge:\n\nAppellants raise numerous challenges to their convictions and sen-\ntences stemming from their involvement in an investment fraud\nscheme and the subsequent coverup. We conclude that their chal-\nlenges lack merit and therefore affirm the judgments below. We also\nconclude that pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, federal forfeiture\nlaw supersedes the garnishment protections that Georgia state law\nprovides for funds in an individual retirement account.\n\n                  2\n\fI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis case arose out of a wide-ranging investment fraud scheme,\ncarried out by a network of conspirators, who bilked millions of dol-\nlars from investors across the country. The investments were pro-\ngrams that promised enormous profits, supposedly derived from\nsecret trading in debentures issued by European \"prime\" banks. The\nconspirators included Stephen Oles, a self-described\"trader\" in the\nfraudulent investment programs; appellant Ernst Tietjen, another\ntrader; Ramona Holcombe and Stanie Benz, who served as \"project\nmanagers\" or \"directors\" for the programs; appellant Gary Bollin, a\n\"broker\" for the fraudulent investments; Roger Damron, who offered\nthe investments in and near Huntington, West Virginia; David Raimer\nand his wife, Jennifer, who conducted numerous bank transactions\ninvolving investors' funds; and appellant James Gormley, an attorney\nfrom Atlanta, Georgia, who advised and assisted Oles, David Raimer,\nBollin, and Damron with the fraudulent investments and money laun-\ndering. The cast of characters relevant to Appellants also included\nFinbar F. Dempsey & Company, a law firm in the Turks and Caicos\nIslands; Robert Edwards, an escrow agent and attorney in Atlanta; Dr.\nRalph and Rita Touma, investors; and other investors in the programs.1\n                                                                     1\n\nIn mid-1995, David Raimer and Oles began offering investment\nprograms under the name \"Exodus International.\" The programs\ninvolved supposed trading of European \"prime bank\" debentures and\npromised very high rates of return with little or no risk to investors.\nAccording to the Exodus literature that they distributed, the programs\nwere available on a limited basis to groups of investors whose money\nwould be pooled and delivered to a \"prime\" bank. The investment\nprincipal was supposedly secured by a bank guarantee and, therefore,\nwas never at risk. Millions of dollars in profits were to be generated\nwithin a few months from the trading of debentures. For example, one\nprogram, \"Program 39,\" offered a profit of $73,000,000 in ten\nmonths, based on an investment of $400,000.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 Because only the appeals of Bollin, Tietjen, and Gormley are before\nus, we limit our discussion of the facts to those facts relevant to Appel-\nlants.\n\n                  3\n\fTo carry out the scheme, bank accounts were established with the\nguidance and assistance of Oles's attorney, appellant Gormley.\nRaimer established an escrow account in Orlando, Florida, under the\nname \"Exodus International.\" Per Gormley's advice, the account was\nto be non-interest bearing so as to avoid attracting the IRS's attention.\nThe account was to be used ostensibly to deliver investors' funds into\na debenture trading program. Gormley also helped establish an off-\nshore account in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the name of \"BCI\nCorporation,\" which was part of a so-called \"three-tiered\" offshore\ntrust. According to Gormley, the offshore trust would shield income\nfrom taxation and was the \"vehicle\" through which the debenture\ntrading program was to be conducted.\n\nAppellant Bollin learned about Exodus International Program 39 in\nMay 1995. At Oles' suggestion, Bollin discussed the program with\nGormley. Gormley explained to Bollin how the program worked and\ndrew a sketch for him showing how funds would move through the\nprogram. Gormley told Bollin that debenture trading programs work\n\"if they're handled right\" and that \"once they start paying, they pay\nforever.\" After Bollin gave Gormley literature about Program 39,\nGormley told him that the program looked \"pretty good.\"\n\nGormley also recommended the Exodus International Program to\nStanie Benz. Gormley told Benz that he had extensive experience\nreviewing debenture trading programs and that he had reviewed the\nExodus Program and found it to be a good investment. Gormley\nexplained the relationship between debenture trading programs and\noffshore trust accounts, and described how such an account could be\nused as a holding point for pooling investors' funds and for transfer-\nring funds without their being traceable.\n\nBollin introduced the Exodus Program 39 to Roger Damron. At\nBollin's recommendation, on July 20, 1995, Damron met with Gorm-\nley. Gormley advised Damron concerning the Program 39 literature\nand debenture trading programs in general, and advised him on for-\neign grantor trusts to facilitate the investments and avoid tax liability.\nGormley had Finbar F. Dempsey & Company set up foreign grantor\ntrusts in the Turks and Caicos Islands for Damron and Bollin. Gorm-\nley also established international business corporations for Damron\nand Bollin and advised them about their use in conducting business\n\n                   4\n\ffor the trusts. In addition, Gormley prepared several documents for\nBollin and Damron, such as profit sharing agreements. The idea was\nthat Damron would bring investors into the programs, Bollin would\nact as the broker, and Ramona Holcombe would serve as the program\nmanager and link to the trader, Stephen Oles, who would conduct the\nactual trading.\n\nDamron approached a couple with whom he had a previous invest-\nment relationship, Dr. Ralph and Rita Touma, and sought money to\nplace in Exodus Program 39.22 The Toumas decided to invest, and, in\nlate July 1995, gave Damron $750,000. Damron put $400,000 in an\nescrow account held by Robert Edwards, another Atlanta attorney,\nawaiting an opening in Program 39. Unbeknownst to the Toumas,\nDamron paid Bollin $75,000 from this money.\n\nOn September 13, 1995, Holcombe faxed to Gormley the wire\ncoordinates to transfer funds into Program 39. Gormley forwarded the\nfax to Bollin, who then faxed it to Damron.3\n                                           3 Then, on September 19,\n1995, Gormley drafted a letter for Damron's signature, directing the\ntransfer of the $400,000 from Edwards' escrow account to Bollin's\nforeign grantor trust in the Turks and Caicos Islands, an account set\nup by Gormley. Damron signed the letter and sent it to Edwards.\nEdwards wired the money as instructed on September 20, 1995.4  4A\nfew days later, the money was again transferred, this time from Bol-\nlin's trust account to Damron's trust account, also set up by Gormley\nin the Turks and Caicos Islands. From Damron's account, the money\nwas sent to the BCI Corporation account in the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, an account controlled by Oles and Raimer.\n\nAfter the Toumas' money was sent off, Damron began collecting\nmoney from other people for investment in another, similar trading\nprogram, the \"second deal.\" Bollin told Damron that the second deal\nwould again involve Oles as the trader, but would involve Benz as the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 According to Damron, Dr. and Mrs. Touma were his \"best customers\"\nin the Gold Eagle Program, a program run by Damron that involved\ninvestments in gold coins.\n\n3 This fax is the basis for the wire fraud charge in Count Three.\n\n4 The transfer of the $400,000 is the basis for the money laundering\ncharge in Count Six.\n\n                  5\n\f\"project director.\" Oles later \"lateraled\" his role as the trader to appel-\nlant Tietjen. Although the second deal was similar to Exodus Program\n39, instead of the money going to Oles' BCI Corporation account in\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, the money was transferred to an\naccount in England.\n\nOles had introduced Tietjen to Benz. Tietjen was the head of a\nchurch known as the Apostolic Order of the Remnant House of Israel\n(AORHI). According to Tietjen, AORHI existed wherever he lived,\nsupposedly for the purpose of funding humanitarian projects. To ful-\nfill its purpose, AORHI created other entities, which Tietjen called\nlimited trusts, to hold assets, and an entity called General Securities,\nLtd. (GSL), to \"assist in the money-making.\" Under cover of these\nentities, Tietjen created official-looking financial documents, such as\na \"Zero Coupon Prime Capital Note,\" and offered debenture trading\nprograms with very high rates of return. In all, Tietjen received, or\nexpected to receive, $2.4 million of investors' funds for placement in\nhis debenture trading program.\n\nAfter Damron sent the money for the second deal, he collected\nanother $140,000 from investors in November and December 1995\nfor placement in yet another debenture trading program, the \"third\ndeal.\" In January 1996, Damron wired $130,000 of the investors'\nmoney to his account in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The money\nwas to be sent off for investment.\n\nAs it turned out, the debenture trading programs were complete\nfrauds. The Government's expert explained that investment programs\ninvolving the trading of debentures or other financial instruments\nissued by so-called \"prime banks\" do not exist. Indicators of the\nfraudulent nature of such programs include the use of the term \"prime\nbank;\" convoluted and nonsensical descriptions of the investment pro-\ngram itself; very unrealistic rates of return with little or no risk; an\nassertion that investors' funds represented \"good, clean cleared funds\nof non-criminal origin;\" and the claim that entities such as the Federal\nReserve Bank or the World Bank had approved the programs or\naccepted the documents. These characteristics of fraud were present\nin the Exodus Program 39 documents.\n\nInstead of placing the money into bank debentures, Oles transferred\nthe money from the BCI Corporation account to the Exodus Interna-\n\n                  6\n\ftional account in Orlando. David Raimer withdrew funds from the\naccount and sent cash to Oles upon request. Oles used these funds for\nhimself, and Raimer also kept large sums. The funds sent to Tietjen\nsimilarly were not placed in a debentures trading program, but instead\nworked their way through various accounts in the names of AORHI\nand others, with much of the money being used by Tietjen for his own\npurposes.\n\nWhen the Toumas, Damron's investors in Program 39, did not\nreceive payments as promised, they began to call Damron regularly\nto find out when their payouts would materialize. Oles reportedly\nassured Bollin that payments were imminent. In turn, Bollin reassured\nDamron, who, in turn, reassured the Toumas. After more time passed\nwithout a payout, the Toumas eventually spoke with Bollin and Gor-\nmley. Bollin assured them that the payout would come and that he,\nlike them, was waiting for money. He also told them that he had pre-\nviously traded in these programs and that while it was normal for pay-\nment to be delayed, the programs always paid. Bollin said that he\nwould get paid only if the investment paid out, failing to disclose that\nDamron had already paid him $75,000 out of the Toumas' money.\nGormley told the Toumas that he did not know much about their\ninvestment, but that he knew these programs did pay out in the past,\nand that the delays \"usually work themselves out in a week or so.\"\nGormley told the Toumas that they had the option to sue Oles for\ntheir money, but warned that a law suit would only lead to more\ndelays in receiving their money.\n\nBollin also spoke with another investor, Marianne Bradley, who\nhad invested as part of the second deal. When Bradley asked about\nthe status of her investment, Bollin stated that \"trades are being\nmade,\" that trading had started on January 16, and that \"we\" had \"fro-\nzen the account to protect the money.\" Bollin also stated that he had\ninvested $100,000 in the same program as Bradley and that he would\noccasionally get involved in a trading program with $100,000 to\n$500,000. He stated that based on his experience, the program would\neither pay out as promised in ten days or Bradley would get her\nmoney back. Bollin, however, did not invest any of his own money\nin the second deal, and his only investment experience had been a\n$100 investment several years before.\n\n                  7\n\fFinally, in January 1996, the Toumas reported their dealings with\nDamron to the FBI. On February 9, 1996, the FBI conducted a search\nof Damron's house. Shortly thereafter, a grand jury investigation was\ncommenced in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nDamron decided to return to the investors the $130,000 sent to his\naccount in the Turks and Caicos Islands for the third deal. Damron\nwired over $120,000 of the money to Gormley and $8,000 to himself\nso that Gormley could arrange for checks to the investors. Gormley\nalso arranged for backdated paperwork to be created by the attorneys\nin the Turks and Caicos Islands to explain the earlier transfer of\n$130,000 as a \"loan\" from one of Damron's companies to another.\nThe loan paperwork was created in March 1996, but was backdated\nto January 17, 1996, the date of the $130,000 transfer.\n\nDamron was eventually indicted for his involvement in the invest-\nment fraud scheme. After the indictment, Oles decided to send Dam-\nron $50,000. Damron was then under a financial reporting\nrequirement with the court. He contacted Gormley, who advised him\nhow to structure the transaction so as to avoid the court-imposed\nreporting requirement. On Gormley's advice, the transfer was struc-\ntured as a loan from Bollin's wife to Damron's wife. Bollin kept\n$10,000 for himself and sent the remaining $40,000 to Damron in\nincrements of $5,000. Gormley also assisted in Damron's receipt of\nan additional $100,000 from Oles, again funneled through the Turks\nand Caicos Islands.\n\nIn August 1997, Gormley informed Damron that Oles was again\nsending money to Damron, $400,000, to be used to pay back certain\ninvestors. Gormley and Damron discussed how to use the money for\n\"damage control.\" They decided to repay Damron's numerous inves-\ntors in the second deal but not the Toumas. Damron prepared a list\nof investors who had invested in the program and how much they had\ninvested. He gave the list to Gormley. Later, Damron sent a separate\nletter to Paul Dempsey in the Turks and Caicos Islands, detailing the\ninvestors who were to receive payments and directing that the pay-\nments be made. A copy of that letter with Damron's handwritten nota-\ntion that it had been faxed to Dempsey was found in Gormley's\noffice. The investors listed in Damron's letter were all paid, receiving\nchecks from the Turks and Caicos Islands in plain envelopes with no\n\n                  8\n\freturn address and no cover letter. Approximately $400,000 was\nrepaid to twenty investors. Gormley was paid $20,000 by Oles for his\nservices.\n\nWhen the Government learned of the payments to the investors,\nwho were potential witnesses against Damron, it sought to have the\nmoney placed in escrow pending resolution of Damron's case. At a\nhearing in October 1997, Gormley testified that to his knowledge,\nDamron had not directed, coordinated, or orchestrated the payments\nto investors.\n\nDamron eventually pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laun-\ndering and agreed to cooperate with the United States in its investiga-\ntion of the other conspirators. On September 9, 1998, Appellants Gary\nBollin, Ernst Tietjen, and James Gormley were charged in a fourteen-\ncount indictment, along with co-defendants Stephen Oles, Ramona\nHolcombe, Stanie Benz, David Raimer, and Jennifer Raimer, for\ncriminal acts stemming from the fraudulent investment scheme.\n\nCount One charged all defendants with conspiring to commit wire\nfraud, securities fraud, and obstruction of justice, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged all defendants with violating 18\nU.S.C. § 1956(h), conspiracy to launder money. The indictment also\nincluded a forfeiture provision as to all defendants, premised upon a\nconviction for money laundering, and included a notice to seek substi-\ntute assets. Tietjen was not named in any of the other counts.\n\nBoth Gormley and Bollin faced additional charges. Both were\ncharged in Count Three with aiding and abetting wire fraud, in viola-\ntion of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 2. Count Six charged them with aiding\nand abetting money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and 2. Bollin was also charged in Count Four\nwith an additional count of wire fraud, and in Counts Seven and Eight\nwith two more counts of money laundering. In Counts Nine and Ten,\nBollin was charged with selling securities without having registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, in violation of 15\nU.S.C. §§ 78o(a)(1) and 78ff. Gormley was charged in Counts Thir-\nteen and Fourteen with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The\ndistrict court dismissed Count Fourteen at trial.\n\n                  9\n\fBefore trial, defendants David Raimer and Stanie Benz pleaded\nguilty to charges in the indictment. The charges against Jennifer\nRaimer were dismissed. Stephen Oles fled and remained a fugitive\nthroughout the trial. On November 19, 1999, a jury returned a guilty\nverdict against the remaining defendants on each count submitted to\nthe jury. The jury also returned a $1.2 million forfeiture verdict. The\ndistrict court denied the post-trial motions for judgment of acquittal\nand/or a new trial made by Gormley, Bollin, and Tietjen.\n\nThe district court sentenced Bollin to 108 months imprisonment,\nthree years supervised release, and restitution in the amount of\n$783,535.55 The court sentenced Tietjen to 135 months imprisonment,\ntwo years supervised release, and $1,761,035 in restitution.6\n                                                            6 The court\nsentenced Gormley to 97 months imprisonment, three years super-\nvised release, and $783,545 in restitution.7\n                                           7 Each defendant was also\nfound jointly and severally liable for the $1.2 million forfeiture.8\n                                                                   8 Fol-\nlowing the entry of judgment against each defendant, each defendant\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.\n\nII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nAppellant Gormley challenges the sufficiency of the evidence sup-\nporting his convictions on Counts One, Two, Three, Six, and Thir-\nteen. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court\nmust take the evidence in the light most favorable to the government\nand must determine whether any rational juror could have found the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 Bollin was sentenced to 108 months imprisonment on Counts Two,\nSix, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten, and 60 months on Counts One, Three\nand Four, to run concurrently.\n\n6 Tietjen was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment on Count One and\n135 months on Count Two, to run concurrently.\n\n7 Gormley was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment on Counts One,\nThree, and Thirteen, and 97 months on Counts Two and Six, to run con-\ncurrently.\n\n8 In an interlocutory appeal, Gormley challenged the district court's rul-\ning that he could be held jointly and severally liable for any forfeitable\nassets possessed by his codefendants. This court affirmed in an unpub-\nlished opinion. United States v.

Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count One--\n        Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, Securities Fraud,\n        and Obstruction of Justice\n\nTo support a conviction for conspiracy, \"the government must\nshow, first, that a conspiracy existed; then that the defendant had\nknowledge of the conspiracy; and finally, that the defendant voluntar-\nily became a part of the conspiracy.\" United States v.

Gormley contends that the Government proved three dis-\ntinct conspiracies instead of the single conspiracy alleged in Count\nOne of the indictment: one conspiracy to commit wire fraud, a second\nconspiracy to commit securities fraud, and a third conspiracy to\nobstruct justice. Gormley argues that the Government's proof resulted\nin a material variance.\n\nA \"variance\" occurs when \"the evidence at trial establishes facts\nmaterially different from those alleged in the indictment.\" United\nStates v.

The question whether the evidence shows a single or multiple\nconspiracies is for the jury, and the finding of a single conspiracy\nmust stand unless the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to\nthe Government, would not allow any reasonable juror to reach such\na verdict.

Although the conspiracy had mul-\ntiple objects--wire fraud, securities fraud, and obstruction--the\nobjects clearly were related to the overall goal of defrauding investors\nthrough fraudulent offshore debentures trading programs.

The wire fraud was used to move the investors' funds into the\nhands of Oles, the Raimers, and Tietjen. The obstruction was part of\ncontrolling the damage after Damron came under investigation for his\nrole in the fraudulent debentures trading program.\n\nThe fact that some of the co-conspirators, including Gormley,\nnever marketed the debentures trading programs to the actual inves-\ntors does not prevent a finding of a single conspiracy because a defen-\ndant may be a member of a conspiracy without taking part in all of\nits activities. See United States v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658315\"><a href=\"/opinion/658315/united-states-v-william-kenneth-banks-aka-kenny-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1044</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1054 (4th Cir.\n1993). Similarly, a single conspiracy may be found even though Tiet-\njen, Holcombe, and Benz were not active in returning money to inves-\ntors. The very structure of the scheme in this case required the\nconspirators to play different roles--brokers, project managers, and\ntraders--to carry out the fraud and obscure the disposition of funds\nplaced in the trading programs. Gormley prepared the different instru-\nments used to carry out the scheme to defraud investors and directed\nthe opening of the offshore trusts.

Finally, regardless of whether \"hos-\ntility\" arose between Oles on one side and Damron, Gormley and Bol-\nlin on the other after Damron was indicted in 1997, Oles was the\nsource of the funds sent to Damron and the source of the funds used\nto repay investors, thus supporting the conclusion that they were par-\nticipating in a common scheme. In sum, the evidence was sufficient\nto support the jury's finding of a single conspiracy.99\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 The evidence also was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that\nGormley was part of the conspiracy. Gormley was involved with Oles,\nthe Raimers, Bollin, and Damron from the very beginning. Gormley\nknew how the Exodus Program worked, as we discuss in more detail\nbelow, knew the program was fraudulent, and took actions in furtherance\nof the scheme. After Damron was placed under investigation, Gormley\nalso played a role in the return of funds to investors.\n\n                  12\n\fMoreover, even if the evidence established separate conspiracies,\na variance is grounds for reversal only if it infringed the defendant's\n\"`substantial rights' and thereby resulted in actual prejudice.\" Ken-\nnedy, 32 F.3d at 883. \"In order to show actual prejudice stemming\nfrom a multiple conspiracy variance, an appellant must prove that\n`there are so many defendants and so many separate conspiracies\nbefore the jury' that the jury was likely to transfer evidence from one\nconspiracy to a defendant involved in an unrelated conspiracy.\" Id.\n(quoting United States v. Caporale, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1500 (11th Cir.\n1989)).\n\nIn Kennedy, we held that an alleged variance had no prejudicial\neffect because there was \"no possibility that evidence from unrelated\nconspiracies would be improperly attributed to individual defen-\ndants.\" Kennedy, 32 F.3d at 883. Kennedy involved eight defendants\nand, at most, three related conspiracies. We recognized that \"cases\ninvolving similar numbers of defendants and conspiracies are `not so\ncomplex by definition that the jury will be unable to segregate the evi-\ndence properly.'\" Id. (quoting Caporale, 806 F.2d at 1501 (eleven\ndefendants and two conspiracies)). Further, the fact that the district\ncourt ordered a severance, and each defendant thus faced trial alone,\nvirtually eliminated any likelihood of prejudicial \"spillover\" of evi-\ndence. Id.\n\nLike in Kennedy, this case involves only eight named defendants\nand, if there was a variance, at most three conspiracies. Although the\ndistrict court did not order a severance, only four of the eight defen-\ndants named in the indictment were tried together. Further, the district\ncourt granted Gormley's request for a multiple objects jury instruc-\ntion, instructing the jury to consider each defendant's role in the con-\nspiracy. The verdict form required the jury to make particularized\nfindings about which objects each defendant conspired to violate, fur-\nther helping the jury to compartmentalize the evidence as to each\ndefendant. Any risk of a \"spillover effect\" was slight. Gormley's con-\nviction on Count One is affirmed.\n\nB. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Three, Wire Fraud\n\nTo convict Gormley for wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1343, \"the government must prove: `1) a scheme to defraud and 2)\n\n                  13\n\fthe use of a wire communication in furtherance of that scheme.'\"\nUnited States v.

Gormley argues that the evidence is insufficient to\nprove that he transmitted or caused to be transmitted to Damron a\nSeptember 13, 1995, memorandum, which furnished the wire coordi-\nnates for investors to send funds to Oles' offshore Exodus account.\nGormley also argues that the Government failed to prove that Gorm-\nley knew the funds to be sent to Oles' offshore account came from\nthe Toumas, and thus the Government failed to prove that Gormley\nhad the requisite fraudulent intent. We conclude that the evidence was\nsufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\nHolcombe testified that she faxed the memorandum containing the\nwire coordinates to Gormley's office on September 13, 1995, and the\nfax headers on the document confirm her testimony. Damron testified\nthat he received the memorandum from Bollin on September 13,\n1995. Bollin testified that he could not recall how he obtained the\ndocument. Holcombe, however, testified that she faxed the memoran-\ndum only to Gormley because she believed that he was the person\ncontrolling the funds. Although Gormley shared office space with\nseven to nine other attorneys, he was a sole practitioner, and the attor-\nneys in Gormley's space-sharing arrangement did not share clients.\nThere is no evidence that Bollin worked with any of the other attor-\nneys in Gormley's office. The evidence supports the conclusion that\nGormley received the memorandum from Holcombe and furnished it\nto Bollin, who in turn sent the memorandum to Damron.\n\nFurther, assuming that Gormley did not know the $400,000 came\nfrom the Toumas,1010 Gormley's lack of knowledge is irrelevant\nbecause, as the Government points out, it was not required to prove\nthat anyone had put up any money and had actually been defrauded\nin the wire fraud scheme (i.e., that the scheme succeeded), so long as\nthe act of wire fraud was in furtherance of the scheme.

Gor-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 As we discuss below, there was sufficient evidence from which the\njury could infer that Gormley was aware that the Toumas had contributed\nto the $400,000.\n\n                  14\n\fmley's delivery of the wire coordinates for Oles' offshore account\nwas in furtherance of the fraudulent investment scheme. Moreover,\nthere is sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that, by\nthe time of the September 13, 1995, fax, Gormley knew the scheme\nwas fraudulent. Gormley was a self proclaimed securities lawyer, and\nhe claimed to be an expert on investment programs. Gormley\nreviewed the Exodus Program documents and was aware that the Pro-\ngram was a prime bank debentures trading program. The Govern-\nment's expert testified that there were numerous indicators of fraud\nin the Exodus Program documents that should have raised a red flag\nto an experienced securities lawyer. If Gormley was not already\naware that the debentures trading program was a scam, on August 17,\n1995, Gormley met with Agent David Caruso of the Federal Bureau\nof Investigations, who explained the fraudulent nature of investment\nprograms involving \"prime bank\" financial instruments, like the Exo-\ndus Program.

Gormley drafted\na letter dated September 19, 1995, from Damron to Edwards directing\nEdwards to release the $400,000.1111 Gormley disputes only whether the\nGovernment proved that he knew the funds were the proceeds of\nfraud. Gormley argues that the evidence failed to establish that Gorm-\nley knew the Toumas had put up the $400,000, but instead established\nthat Gormley had been informed by Damron that the money came\nfrom Damron's profits from trading in Gold Eagle coins. There was\nsubstantial evidence, however, from which the jury could reasonably\ninfer that Gormley knew the $400,000 was the proceeds of fraud.\n\nIn July 1995, Damron discussed with Gormley the Exodus Program\ndocuments, foreign bank debenture trading programs, and foreign\ngrantor trusts. Damron testified that he wanted a foreign grantor trust\nbecause the money he planned to place in the Exodus Program would\nbe his clients' money: \"If I participated in the program, it would be\nwith money from my clients. So I felt that I should have control over\nit, I should have my own foreign grantor trust.\" Damron's client with\nregard to the $400,000 was Dr. Touma. To protect Dr. Touma's inter-\nest, Damron asked Gormley about designating beneficiaries of his for-\neign grantor trust:\n\n        Q: When did you have your discussion with Mr. Gormley\n        about foreign grantor -- beneficiaries of foreign\n        grantor trusts?\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11 Gormley suggests that the evidence showed that Damron drafted the\nrelease letter, not Gormley. We disagree. Damron testified on direct\nexamination that Gormley drafted the release letter, which Damron then\nsigned and sent to Edwards. Damron did not repudiate his testimony that\nGormley drafted the letter, but merely confirmed on cross examination\nthat he instructed Edwards in a letter that the $400,000 was to be trans-\nferred.\n\n                  16\n\f       A: That was -- would be just probably late July. It was\n       before Dr. Touma -- or maybe shortly thereafter--\n       when Dr. Touma was getting ready to make that large\n       investment, he was concerned that if I was okay, it was\n       okay, but what if something happened to me. He\n       wanted some protection for his money. And so I asked\n       Mr. Gormley what could we do.\n\n       Q: What did Mr. Gormley tell you?\n\n       A: Well, that's what we did. We set up that successor ben-\n       eficiary thing so that if something happened to me, it\n       was all spelled out who would get what percentage of\n       the money.\n\nThis testimony supports an inference that Gormley knew Dr. Touma\nhad contributed to the $400,000.\n\nFurther, Gormley confirmed in a letter dated July 24, 1995, that Dr.\nTouma was set up as the beneficiary of the trust. In the same letter,\nGormley mentioned that \"as to the investment matter we discussed,\"\nthe funds would be held in Gormley's escrow account pending receipt\nof documents and a bank guarantee. Damron testified that the \"invest-\nment matter\" was the placement of $400,000 into the Exodus Pro-\ngram. Gormley was aware that Damron had deposited the $400,000\nwith an escrow agent, Edwards, in preparation for the investment. At\nthis point, Gormley refused to give Damron the \"green light\" because\nno bank guarantee had yet been provided.\n\nA short time later, in August 1995, Gormley met with Agent\nCaruso of the FBI, who explained to Gormley the fraudulent nature\nof prime bank debenture trading programs. By this point, if not ear-\nlier, Gormley knew these debenture trading programs were fraudu-\nlent. Nonetheless, on September 13, 1995, in furtherance of a program\nhe knew was a scam, Gormley sent to Bollin the fax from Oles and\nHolcombe containing the wire coordinates to Oles' offshore Exodus\naccount, thereby participating in wire fraud.\n\nGormley then prepared and faxed a profit sharing agreement\nbetween Damron and Bollin, dated September 18, 1995. The agree-\n\n                  17\n\fment noted that \"Damron has introduced Bollin [sic] certain individu-\nals who have placed U.S. $400,000 in Escrow for investment.\" This\nagreement contemplated Damron and Bollin splitting profits of over\n$1.8 million per week. Gormley then prepared for Damron the Sep-\ntember 19, 1995, letter instructing Edwards to transfer the $400,000\nto Bollin's foreign grantor trust. The funds were transferred the next\nday.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence to establish that Gormley knew the\nExodus Program was a fraud, knew the $400,000 was being invested\nin this fraud, and knew he was facilitating the transfer of the funds\nto the perpetrators of this fraud. Furthermore, based on his knowledge\nthat Dr. Touma was the beneficiary of Damron's foreign grantor trust,\nthe reference to \"certain investors\" in the Bollin/Damron profit shar-\ning agreement, and Gormley's connections with and knowledge of the\nrelationships among Oles, Bollin, Damron, their offshore accounts,\nand the Exodus Program, the jury could reasonably infer that, at the\ntime Gormley participated in the transfer of the $400,000 to Bollin's\noffshore account, Gormley knew the money was the proceeds of fraud.12  12\nWe are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support Gorm-\nley's money laundering conviction.\n\nGormley raises the same arguments as to the sufficiency of the evi-\ndence on Count Two, the money laundering conspiracy charge. For\nthe same reasons, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport the jury's verdict.\n\nD. Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Thirteen, False\n        Declarations before the Court\n\nGormley was convicted of making false declarations before the\ncourt under 18 U.S.C. § 1623(a), based on two allegedly false state-\nments that he made at an October 23, 1997, contempt hearing. In\n1997, after Damron was placed under investigation, a financial\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12 Thus, it is irrelevant whether Gormley, as an attorney, had a duty to\ninquire as to the source of his client's funds because he knew the\n$400,000 was the proceeds of fraud. Indeed, Gormley knew the $400,000\nwas the proceeds of a fraudulent scheme when he participated in wire\nfraud in furtherance of that scheme on September 13, 1995.\n\n                  18\n\frestraining order was issued against Damron. While that restraining\norder was in effect, approximately $400,000 was repaid to certain\ninvestors. When questioned about the $400,000 in repayments, Gorm-\nley testified as follows:\n\n       Q: And what is your understanding as to those disburse-\n       ments and how they occurred?\n\n       A: And I believe that those are the bank drafts that these\n       individuals received. And from everything I know, that\n       money was not Mr. Damron's money, he didn't own it,\n       he didn't control it.\n\n       And I don't know what this word \"expectancy interest\"\n       is in the Court's order, exactly what that means, but I\n       don't believe that Mr. Damron had any such interest in\n       that money.\n\n       Q: Did Roger A. Damron direct or coordinate or orches-\n       trate the disbursement of these funds to these individual\n       investors?\n\n       A: To my knowledge he did not.\n\nThe indictment alleged that at the time of his testimony, Gormley\nknew Damron had an interest in the $400,000 and knew Damron had\ncoordinated, orchestrated and directed the repayments. Gormley con-\ntends that his perjury conviction should be reversed because (1) there\nwas insufficient evidence to show that Gormley knew of Damron's\nrole in the repayment; (2) the examiner's questions before the grand\njury were fundamentally ambiguous and were insufficient as a matter\nof law to support a perjury conviction; and (3) his responses were lit-\nerally true.\n\nThe evidence was sufficient to show that, at the time of his testi-\nmony, Gormley knew of Damron's role in returning the money to the\ninvestors. Before any money was sent to the investors, Damron and\nGormley discussed who should be paid. Damron prepared a list of the\namounts due to the investors and sent the list to Gormley. The persons\n\n                  19\n\fon that list were the persons who were eventually paid. Further, dis-\ncovered in Gormley's office was a copy of a handwritten fax from\nDamron to Paul Dempsey in the Turks and Caicos Islands, directing\nthe repayment of money to the investors. The fax was dated August\n27, 1997, and a notation indicated that it was faxed \"before 10:30\nam.\" Damron testified that it was his practice to make a notation in\nthe upper right corner of a document when he faxed it. Moreover,\nbased on the presence of the notation on faxes that Gormley received\nfrom Damron, the jury could reasonably infer that Gormley was fully\naware of Damron's practice. Although Damron testified that Gormley\nrefused to forward to Dempsey the list of investors to be repaid and\nadvised Damron not to do it himself, there is sufficient evidence to\nsupport the conclusion that, at the time of his October 23, 1997, testi-\nmony, Gormley knew Damron had directed Dempsey to send the\nmoney to the investors.\n\nGormley argues that the examiner's question whether Damron \"di-\nrected, coordinated, or orchestrated\" the disbursement of funds to the\ninvestors was fundamentally unclear and impossible to answer, and\ntherefore an improper basis for a perjury charge. Gormley argues that\nthe question asked of him is like the question found insufficient to\nsupport a perjury conviction in United States v. Rendon-Marquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2522954\"><a href=\"/opinion/2522954/united-states-v-rendon-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence are\ncommitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be\nreversed absent an abuse of discretion. United States v. Bostian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699219\"><a href=\"/opinion/699219/united-states-v-samuel-leroy-bostian/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (4th Cir. 1995). Where a defendant fails to object to an\nasserted error at trial, the \"plain error\" standard applies. United States\nv.

R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\nA. Attorney-Client Privilege\n\nBollin contends that Robert Edwards' testimony was admitted in\nviolation of Bollin's attorney-client privilege. The district court's\ndecision whether certain evidence is subject to the privilege is a\nmixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review. In re Grand\nJury Proceedings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677013\"><a href=\"/opinion/677013/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-thursday-special-grand-jury-september-term/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 (4th Cir. 1994). The party claim-\ning the privilege bears the burden of demonstrating that: \"the\nattorney-client privilege applies; (2) the communications were pro-\ntected by the privilege; and (3) the privilege was not waived.\" United\nStates v. Aramony, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721465\"><a href=\"/opinion/721465/united-states-v-william-aramony-united-states-of-america-v-stephen-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1389 (4th Cir. 1996). Assuming that\nan attorney-client relationship existed between Bollin and Edwards,15  15\nBollin does not identify any particular testimony that allegedly was\nprivileged, but instead argues that Edwards should not have been\nallowed to testify at all. It is well-established, however, that the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nGormley guilty for either response because the United States charged in\nthe conjunctive, charging that Gormley falsely testified about whether\nDamron had an interest in the $400,000 and whether he had, in fact,\ncoordinated, orchestrated, and directed the repayment of investors. See\nTurner v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108033\"><a href=\"/opinion/108033/turner-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (1970) (reaffirming the \"gen-\neral rule\" that where an indictment charges several acts in the conjunc-\ntive, a guilty verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to\nany one of them); United States v. Sarihifard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757754\"><a href=\"/opinion/757754/united-states-v-mohammad-sarihifard/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (4th Cir.\n1998) (applying the Turner rule to a perjury charge).\n\n15 The record shows that Bollin contacted Edwards to act as an escrow\nagent and not for the purpose of seeking legal advice. The district court\nassumed, without finding, that an attorney-client relationship existed\nbetween Bollin and Edwards.\n\n                    22\n\fattorney-client privilege protects only confidential communications\nmade for the purpose of seeking legal advice. E.g., United States v.\nTedder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476828\"><a href=\"/opinion/476828/united-states-v-david-l-tedder-united-states-of-america-v-david-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1441-42 (4th Cir. 1986). The privilege does\nnot prevent an attorney from testifying as to non-confidential matters.\n\nMoreover, we agree with the district court that Bollin waived any\nprivilege that may have attached when he testified to the grand jury\nregarding the same transactions and communications about which\nEdwards testified. See United States v. Plache, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547641\"><a href=\"/opinion/547641/united-states-v-richard-plache-james-attarian/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1380\n(9th Cir. 1990) (finding a waiver of the attorney-client privilege\nwhere the defendant testified before the grand jury regarding his con-\nversations with counsel). The fact that Bollin was testifying before the\ngrand jury pursuant to a subpoena does not preclude effective waiver.\nSee id. The district court did not err in allowing Edwards to testify.\n\nB. Exclusion of Evidence of Oles' Flight\n\nBollin further contends that the district court abused its discretion\nby excluding evidence that co-defendant Stephen Oles absconded.\nBollin argues that the evidence of Oles' flight would have shown Oles\nto be a man who manipulated Bollin into participating in the events\nin this case, and would have been highly probative of Bollin's intent.\nAlthough a co-defendant's flight may be relevant to show the guilt of\nthat defendant, see United States v. Porter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490127\"><a href=\"/opinion/490127/united-states-v-wayne-porter-united-states-of-america-v-earl-dean-jolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir.\n1987), it does not tend to show that another defendant is innocent, at\nleast not where, as here, there can be more than one guilty party. See\nUnited States v. Ortland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738294\"><a href=\"/opinion/738294/46-fed-r-evid-serv-837-97-cal-daily-op-serv-1971-97-daily-journal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (9th Cir. 1997). Further,\nany probative value of Oles' flight was substantially outweighed by\nthe danger of confusing the issues where Oles was not being tried\nwith the rest of the defendants. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. The district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion.\n\nC. Admission of Bollin's Grand Jury Testimony\n\nBollin contends that the district court abused its discretion when it\nallowed the Government to present a redacted version of his grand\njury testimony but refused to allow him to present the omitted por-\ntions under the rule of completeness or the former testimony excep-\ntion to the hearsay rule. We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n                  23\n\f1. Former Testimony Exception\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1) provides an exception to the\nhearsay rule for the former testimony of a declarant where the declar-\nant is unavailable as a witness.16\n                                 16 A declarant is \"unavailable\" when\nthe declarant \"is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of\nprivilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declar-\nant's statement.\" Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)(1). Bollin contends that he was\n\"unavailable\" because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.\n\nA criminal defendant who invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege\nmakes himself unavailable to any other party. United States v. Bum-\npass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700457\"><a href=\"/opinion/700457/united-states-v-timothy-lavon-bumpass/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1102 (4th Cir. 1995). Rule 804(a) provides, how-\never, that \"[a] declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption,\nrefusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the\nprocurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the\npurpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.\" Fed.\nR. Evid. 804(a). By invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege, Bollin\nmade himself unavailable for the purpose of preventing his testimony,\nand he therefore cannot invoke the exception in Rule 804(b)(1).\nAccord United States v. Peterson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729660\"><a href=\"/opinion/729660/united-states-v-shawn-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(holding that a defendant who exercises his privilege not to testify at\na second trial of his case is not entitled to introduce the testimony he\ngave at the first trial); United States v.

Rule of Completeness\n\nThe \"rule of completeness\" is found in Federal Rule of Evidence\n106, which provides:\n\n        When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is\n        introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16 Bollin also argues that his grand jury statements are not hearsay. His\nstatements to the grand jury were made out of court, and Bollin would\nintroduce them to prove the truth of the matter asserted. They are hear-\nsay. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). The statements were admissible by the\nGovernment as admissions under Rule 801(d)(2).\n\n                  24\n\f       introduction at that time of any other part or any other writ-\n       ing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be con-\n       sidered contemporaneously with it.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 106. The purpose of the rule is \"to prevent a party from\nmisleading the jury by allowing into the record relevant portions of\nthe excluded testimony which clarify or explain the part already\nreceived.\" United States v. Wilkerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718623\"><a href=\"/opinion/718623/united-states-v-ronald-sherrill-wilkerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696 (4th Cir.\n1996). The portions of the excluded testimony thus must be relevant\nto an issue in the case, and the court need only admit the portions that\nare necessary to clarify or explain the portion of the testimony already\nadmitted. Id.\n\nBollin identifies several portions of his grand jury testimony that\nhe contends should have been admitted under Rule 106. We have\nreviewed Bollin's grand jury testimony as admitted and his unredac-\nted grand jury testimony. Like the district court, we conclude that the\nomitted testimony was not necessary to avoid misleading the jury or\notherwise place the admitted testimony in context. The fact that some\nof the omitted testimony arguably was exculpatory does not, without\nmore, make it admissible under the rule of completeness.\n\nD. Admission of Tietjen's Grand Jury Testimony\n\nThe Government introduced against Tietjen a redacted version of\nhis grand jury testimony. Because Tietjen did not raise at trial his\nobjections to the admission of his grand jury testimony, the plain error\nstandard of review applies. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 731-32.\n\nTietjen first argues that his grand jury testimony was taken in vio-\nlation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and\ntherefore should not have been admitted. His claim is foreclosed by\nUnited States v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109659\"><a href=\"/opinion/109659/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (1977). Like in\nWashington, after being sworn, Tietjen was explicitly advised that he\nhad the right not to incriminate himself and that if any questions\ntended to incriminate him, he had the right under the Fifth Amend-\nment not to answer the question. He was advised that anything he said\ncould be used against him by the grand jury or in subsequent legal\nproceedings, and was advised of his right to counsel. The Government\ncorrectly and completely answered Tietjen's later questions regarding\n\n                  25\n\fhis Fifth Amendment privilege. These warnings eliminated any possi-\nble compulsion to self-incrimination. See id. at 188. Whether Tietjen\nwas a target of the grand jury investigation is irrelevant under Wash-\nington. See id. at 189; United States v. Goodwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697752\"><a href=\"/opinion/697752/united-states-v-donzell-goodwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818-19\n(9th Cir. 1995).\n\nTietjen also maintains that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nhad attached at the time of his grand jury testimony. But at the time\nTietjen testified to the grand jury, no adversary judicial proceedings\nagainst him had yet been initiated. See United States v. Gouveia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111193\"><a href=\"/opinion/111193/united-states-v-gouveia/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (1984) (\"[The Sixth Amendment] right to counsel\nattaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceed-\nings against the defendant.\"). The Government's warnings to Teitjen\nregarding his Fifth Amendment rights do not show that a prosecution\nhad commenced. Indeed, no indictment was returned against Tietjen\nuntil over one year after he testified to the grand jury. His Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel thus had not yet attached.\n\nTietjen further contends that his redacted grand jury testimony,\nread at trial, was not sufficiently complete under the \"rule of com-\npleteness.\" Tietjen's grand jury testimony was redacted to remove all\nreferences to co-defendant Stanie Benz in order to comply with the\nrule in Bruton v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968). Benz entered a\nplea on the day before trial and then testified against Tietjen. The\nredacted version of Tietjen's testimony nonetheless was introduced.\nHowever, the omitted portions of Tietjen's testimony were not neces-\nsary to avoid misleading the jury or to clarify or explain any portion\nof the admitted testimony, and the rule of completeness does not\nrequire the court to admit Tietjen's complete grand jury testimony\nsolely because some portions might be exculpatory. See Wilkerson, 84\nF.3d at 696. Moreover, Tietjen suffered no prejudice. Stanie Benz tes-\ntified at trial, and Tietjen had full opportunity to cross examine her.\nThe district court did not err.\n\nIV. SENTENCING\n\nThe district court's factual findings underlying sentencing enhance-\nments are reviewed for clear error. The district court's legal interpre-\ntations are reviewed de novo. United States v. Akinkoye, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765373\"><a href=\"/opinion/765373/united-states-v-akin-akinkoye-aka-a-sam-akins-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).\n\n                  26\n\fA. Two-Level Enhancement for Abuse of a Position of Trust\n\nBoth Bollin and Tietjen appeal the district court's application of a\ntwo-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 for abuse of a posi-\ntion of trust. Under § 3B1.3, a defendant's sentence is increased by\ntwo levels \"if [the district court] determines that the defendant abused\na position of trust and that abuse significantly contributed to the com-\nmission or concealment of the crime.\" Id. at 203; U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3.\n\"Whether a defendant occupied a position of trust warranting a two-\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3 is a factual determination\nreviewable for clear error.\" United States v. Glymph, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726686\"><a href=\"/opinion/726686/united-states-v-george-glymph-dba-specifications-and-standards-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 727\n(4th Cir. 1996).\n\nWhether a defendant held a position of trust must be \"approached\nfrom the perspective of the victim.\" United States v.

Thus, the § 3B1.3 adjustment may be\napplied \"in a case in which the defendant provides sufficient indicia\nto the victim that the defendant legitimately holds a position of pri-\nvate or public trust when, in fact, the defendant does not.\" U.S.S.G.\n§ 3B1.3, cmt. n.2; see also United States v. Queen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629252\"><a href=\"/opinion/629252/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97739-united-states-of-america-v-walter-ray-queen/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929\n(10th Cir. 1993) (holding that the § 3B1.3 enhancement may apply to\nimposters). In the case of an imposter, it is not merely the defendant's\nmisrepresentation that justifies the § 3B1.3 enhancement. In every\ncase of fraud, the defendant will have created confidence and trust in\nthe victim. But fraud alone does not justify the enhancement. We\nmust \"carefully distinguish between those arms-length commercial\nrelationships where trust is created by the defendant's personality or\nthe victim's credulity, and relationships in which the victim's trust is\nbased on the defendant's position in the transaction.\" United States v.\nKoehn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711098\"><a href=\"/opinion/711098/united-states-v-doyle-koehn/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (10th Cir. 1996). Section 3B1.3 penalizes\ndefendants who take advantage of a position that provides them with\nthe \"freedom to commit a `difficult-to-detect wrong.'\" United States\nv. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673867\"><a href=\"/opinion/673867/united-states-v-lloyd-douglas-moore-united-states-of-america-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (4th Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v.\nHill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548769\"><a href=\"/opinion/548769/united-states-v-arthur-howard-hill-aka-sonny-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506 (9th Cir. 1990)).\n\nTietjen argues that he does not qualify for the § 3B1.3 enhance-\nment because he did not have a trust relationship with the investors\nand because the enhancement may not be applied by imputing to him\na co-conspirator's abuse of a position of trust. The district court\napplied the enhancement based on Tietjen's own abuse of a position\n\n                  27\n\fof trust; the court did not impute to him Benz's alleged abuse of a\nposition of trust. See Moore, 29 F.3d at 179 (holding that one co-\nconspirator's abuse of a position of trust is not attributable to another\nco-conspirator). The district court found that Tietjen falsely held him-\nself out as having a high level of skill and experience in debentures\ntrading. Although it was Benz who actually solicited the investors,\nTietjen caused the impression that he was a legitimate, experienced\ndebentures trader to be passed on to the ultimate investors to induce\nthem to invest. See Queen, 4 F.3d at 930 (affirming an enhancement\nunder § 3B1.3 where the defendant caused his employees to hold him\nout as a legitimate investment advisor/broker). In entrusting Tietjen\nwith their money, the investors provided Tietjen with the discretion\nto invest on their behalf and expected Tietjen to make trades in their\nbest interest, which he did not do. See United States v. Davuluri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772024\"><a href=\"/opinion/772024/united-states-v-surya-prasad-l-davuluri/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 909 (7th Cir. 2001) (noting that what distinguishes situa-\ntions in which § 3B1.3 should apply is \"whether the defendant has\nbroad discretion to act on behalf of the victim and the victim believes\nthe defendant will act in the victim's best interest\"). The district court\ndid not clearly err in finding that Tietjen had abused a position of trust\njustifying an enhancement under § 3B1.3.\n\nBollin also argues that the district court erred in applying the\n§ 3B1.3 enhancement to him because he did not actually possess any\nspecialized knowledge and did not actually assume a position of trust\nvis-a-vis the victims. The district court found that although Bollin\nmay have lacked the specialized knowledge of an actual investment\nbroker, Bollin represented that he knew about debentures trading pro-\ngrams, knew their track record, and had experience investing in them.\nBollin held himself out as experienced in debentures trading and\ncaused that impression to be extended to the ultimate investors. Bollin\nrepresented that he was the \"broker\" in the investment program, and\nthe investors' funds were entrusted to him when they were transferred\nto his offshore trust account. Bollin demonstrated that, as far as the\ninvestors were concerned, he was vested with discretionary authority\nover their money when he falsely claimed to have \"frozen\" the funds\nin order to protect them. Bollin used his position as the \"broker\" in\nthe transaction to lull the investors into delaying going to the authori-\nties or suing to recoup their losses. Although Bollin also falsely repre-\nsented that he was a co-investor in the debentures trading program,\nwe cannot say the district court clearly erred in finding that Bollin\n\n                  28\n\foccupied and abused a position of trust justifying the § 3B1.3\nenhancement.\n\nB. Two-Level Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice\n\nTietjen contends that the district court erred by applying a two-\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice.\nBecause Tietjen failed to raise his objection at sentencing, we review\nfor plain error. See United States v. Kinter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771463\"><a href=\"/opinion/771463/united-states-v-paul-thomas-kinter/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (4th\nCir. 2000), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Tietjen argues that Note 7 of § 3C1.1 governs his sentence\nand precludes the enhancement. We disagree. Because Tietjen was\nalso convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering,\nthe offenses with respect to which the obstruction conduct occurred,\nNote 8 governs. Note 8 provides:\n\n        If the defendant is convicted both of an obstruction offense\n        . . . and an underlying offense (the offense with respect to\n        which the obstruction conduct occurred), the count for the\n        obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the\n        underlying offense under subsection (c) of § 3D1.2 . . . . The\n        offense level for that group of closely related counts will be\n        the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the\n        2-level adjustment specified by this section. . . .\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, cmt. n.8. The enhancement for obstruction of jus-\ntice was proper.\n\nC. Relevant Conduct\n\nTietjen contends that the district court erred by using $2.4 million\nas the relevant conduct amount in the Guidelines calculations for\n\n                   29\n\fCounts One and Two. Tietjen objects to the inclusion of $1 million\nthat he never actually received because the funds were returned to\nBenz by Dean Witter, who refused to complete the transfer.17    17 Tietjen,\nhowever, expected to receive the $1 million from Benz. He did not\nactually receive the funds only because the bank refused to complete\nthe transfer. The $1 million thus was properly attributed to Tietjen.\nFurther, there is no error in the district court's calculation under\nApprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), because Tietjen's\nsentence--60 months on Count One and 135 months on Count Two\nto run concurrently--did not exceed the statutory maximums. See 18\nU.S.C. § 371 (maximum 5 years); 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), (h) (maximum\n20 years); Kinter, 235 F.3d at 199-200 (recognizing that the Apprendi\nholding is limited to factual determinations that increase the penalty\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, and holding\nthat the prescribed statutory maximum is found by looking to the lan-\nguage of the statute criminalizing the offense). The district court did\nnot err.\n\nD. $1.2 Million Forfeiture Judgment\n\nGormley contends that his $1.2 million forfeiture judgment violates\nthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.

Van Brocklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741804\"><a href=\"/opinion/741804/united-states-v-darrell-dean-van-brocklin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.\n1997), in which the Eighth Circuit held that a forfeiture judgment of\nover $1.3 million against a defendant who played a secondary role in\nthe fraudulent scheme violated the Excessive Fines Clause. Id. at 601-\n02. Gormley argues that his forfeiture judgment is excessive in light\nof his minor role in the money laundering activities, the small per-\nsonal benefit that he received, approximately $30,000 in legal fees,\nand his lesser culpability compared to that of the other defendants.\n\nIn United States v. Bajakajian, the defendant pleaded guilty to fail-\nure to report exported currency in the amount of $357,144. 524 U.S.\nat 337. Although 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) required forfeiture of the\nentire amount involved in the offense, the Supreme Court concluded\nthat forfeiture of the entire $357,144 violated the Excessive Fines\nClause because the amount of the forfeiture was grossly dispropor-\ntional to the gravity of the defendant's offense. Id. The defendant's\ncrime was \"solely a reporting offense,\" and his violation was \"unre-\nlated to any other unlawful activities.\" Id. at 337-38. Although the\nmaximum statutory sentence was five years and/or a $250,000 fine,\nthe maximum sentence that could have been imposed on the defen-\ndant under the Sentencing Guidelines was six months and a $5,000\nmaximum fine, thus indicating a minimal level of culpability. Id. at\n338. Moreover, the defendant caused only minimal harm, merely\ndepriving the government of information, but causing no loss to the\npublic fisc. Id. The gravity of the defendant's offense thus was low,\nwhile the amount of the forfeiture was very high. Id. at 339-40. The\nforfeiture of the entire $357,144 therefore violated the Excessive\nFines Clause. Id. at 340.\n\nAfter considering the factors set forth in Bajakajian, we are satis-\nfied that Gormley's $1.2 million forfeiture judgment is not grossly\ndisproportional to the gravity of his offense.18\n                                              18 Unlike in Bajakajian,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18 Gormley's forfeiture was imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the\nsame provision at issue in Bajakajian, and as part of his criminal sen-\ntence. Thus, there is no question that the forfeiture ordered against Gor-\nmley is punitive and therefore subject to analysis under the Excessive\nFines Clause.\n\n                   31\n\fthe nature of Gormley's criminal activity in this case was not merely\na reporting violation. Gormley was involved in money laundering,\nand the money laundering arose out of and involved a continuing\nsecurities fraud scheme that defrauded multiple investors out of mil-\nlions of dollars. See Ahmad, 213 F.3d at 817 (finding the defendant's\nreporting offense to be serious in part because it was part of a larger\ncustoms fraud scheme). The forfeiture judgment was not based on a\nsingle occurrence of money laundering. Instead, the defendants con-\nducted multiple transactions over a period of nearly two years. Fur-\nther, the statutory maximum for Gormley's offense was twenty years\nand/or a $500,000 fine, thus indicating that Congress has found the\noffense to be serious. See Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 336 (noting that\n\"judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong\nin the first instance to the legislature\"). Under the Sentencing Guide-\nlines, Gormley faced a sentence of ninety-seven to 121 months and\na $500,000 fine. See U.S. Sent. Guidelines Manual, Sent. Table.\nAlthough the district court found Gormley eligible for a reduction in\nhis sentence based on his \"minor role\" in the offense, the significant\npenalties Gormley faced demonstrate the gravity of his offense.\n\nMoreover, although Gormley received only about $30,000, he is\nliable in a forfeiture judgment for the foreseeable criminal conduct of\nhis co-conspirators.

In light of the extent of\nthe money laundering, its relationship to the securities fraud scheme,\nand the harm caused, Gormley's $1.2 million forfeiture judgment is\nnot excessive.\n\nE. $783,545 in Restitution\n\nGormley contends that the order to pay restitution in the amount of\n$783,545 violates the Excessive Fines Clause based on the same argu-\n\n                  32\n\fments that he raised regarding his forfeiture judgment.

In his reply brief, Gormley suggests for the first time that the\ndistrict court ordered restitution pursuant to the Mandatory Victims\nRestitution Act of 1996 (MVRA). The MVRA amended the VWPA\nby requiring sentencing courts to impose \"full\" restitution without\nconsidering the defendant's economic circumstances. See 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3663A, 3664(f)(1)(A) (Supp. V 1999); Karam, 201 F.3d at 330.\nUnder the VWPA, the court must first consider the defendant's finan-\ncial situation before determining the amount of restitution to be paid.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a) (1994). Because Gormley's restitution was\nbased on criminal activity that occurred before the MVRA's effective\ndate, Gormley contends that application of the MVRA would violate\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.19   19\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 The MVRA provides that it \"shall, to the extent constitutionally per-\nmissible, be effective for sentencing proceedings in cases in which the\ndefendant is convicted on or after [April 24, 1996].\" 18 U.S.C. § 2248,\nstatutory notes.

Gormley's substitute assets thus were subject to\nrestraint to preserve their availability for forfeiture pending the out-\ncome of his case.\n\nThe jury found Gormley liable for forfeiture of $1.2 million, and\nthe indictment included a notice to seek substitute assets.21\n                                                            21 There is\nprobable cause to believe that at least a significant portion of the $1.2\nmillion in laundered funds is no longer available; the funds were\ntransferred to overseas accounts beyond the jurisdiction of the district\ncourt and were used to repay investors and other individuals. As a\nmember of a conspiracy, Gormley is vicariously liable for the reason-\nably foreseeable conduct of his co-conspirators, both substantively\nand at sentencing. See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1042-43; Hurley, 63 F.3d\nat 23. His substitute assets thus may be subject to forfeiture in the\nevent the laundered funds are determined to be unavailable. See id.\n(affirming the forfeiture of substitute assets where the defendants\nwere held vicariously liable for a $136 million forfeiture based on the\nreasonably foreseeable money laundering activities of their co-\nconspirators). Gormley argues that he was merely an intermediary and\nis therefore entitled to the benefit of the safe harbor provided by\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21 We reject Gormley's argument that his IRA is not subject to forfei-\nture because it was not included in the indictment's list of proposed sub-\nstitute assets. The indictment did not purport to set out an exhaustive list\nof substitute assets, but instead set out a list\"including but not limited\nto\" certain identified assets. See United States v. Moffitt, Swerling &\nKemler, P.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718206\"><a href=\"/opinion/718206/united-states-v-moffitt-zwerling-kemler-pc-american-civil-liberties/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (4th Cir. 1996).\n\n                  37\n\f§ 982(b)(2). Gormley did not raise this argument before the district\ncourt, however, and we decline to address it at this time. We leave it\nto the district court to address this argument and make the appropriate\nfindings if and when the Government moves for an order to forfeit\nGormley's substitute assets.\n\nGormley further argues, however, that the district court should\nhave released his IRA funds because Georgia law insulates all but\n25% of the funds from forfeiture. Under Georgia Code § 18-4-22,\nfunds in an IRA are \"exempt from the process of garnishment until\npaid . . . . Such funds or benefits, when paid . . ., shall be exempt from\nthe process of garnishment only to the extent provided in Code Sec-\ntion 18-4-20 for other disposable earnings, unless a greater exemption\nis otherwise provided by law.\" Ga. Code Ann.§18-4-22. Section 18-\n4-20 limits the garnishment to 25%. Ga. Code Ann.§ 18-4-20. We\nhave found no federal or state case applying § 18-4-22 to a criminal\nforfeiture, and Gormley provides no such authority. As the district\ncourt noted, the cases that address §§ 18-4-20 and 18-4-22 discuss\nshielding an IRA from a creditor attempting to collect a debt. See,\ne.g., Davis v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ga. Ct.

Ct. App.\n1978). Gormley's forfeiture judgment is not merely a debt, but is part\nof his criminal sentence. See 18 U.S.C.§ 982(a)(1) (instructing the\ncourt to order forfeiture of property involved in the offense \"in impos-\ning sentence\" on a person convicted of a money laundering offense).\n\nMoreover, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Con-\nstitution, Georgia law could not insulate Gormley's assets from forfei-\nture to the extent that federal law provides otherwise. A state law is\npreempted to the extent that it conflicts with federal law. Silkwood v.\nKerr-McGee Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111056\"><a href=\"/opinion/111056/silkwood-v-kerr-mcgee-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1984).

See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1). Federal sentencing laws supersede\nstate laws that purport to place limits on a federal defendant's crimi-\nnal sentence when federal law provides otherwise.

Daniels, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558044\"><a href=\"/opinion/558044/united-states-v-jermal-daniels-aka-tony/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130 (4th Cir. 1991) (noting that under the\nSupremacy Clause, state law could not prevent consideration of juve-\nnile proceedings by a federal court in determining a sentence, when\nfederal law provides otherwise).\n\nFurther, under federal law, the funds in Gormley's IRA may be for-\nfeited in their entirety. Section 982(a)(1) states that \"any property,\nreal or personal, involved in\" the money laundering offense, without\nlimitation or qualification, is subject to forfeiture. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 982(a)(1) (emphasis added). The statute makes no allowance for\nproperty protected by state law. Similarly, the substitute assets provi-\nsion provides that the court \"shall order the forfeiture of any other\nproperty up to the value of\" the initially forfeited property, in the\nevent the original property is unavailable. 21 U.S.C. § 853(p) (empha-\nsis added); 18 U.S.C. § 982(b)(1). Congress requires the forfeiture of\nany other property as substitute assets and again makes no allowance\nfor protections offered under state law. Cf. United States v. Lot 5, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669167\"><a href=\"/opinion/669167/united-states-of-america-counter-defendant-v-lot-5-fox-grove-alachua/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that because 21 U.S.C.\n§ 881(a)(7) makes no exception for property protected by state law,\nthe Florida homestead exemption does not protect real property from\nforfeiture under federal law). As this court has recognized, the substi-\ntute assets provision in § 853(p) \"was enacted to make the govern-\nment's forfeiture efforts more effective.\" United States v. Moffitt,\nSwerling & Kemler, P.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718206\"><a href=\"/opinion/718206/united-states-v-moffitt-zwerling-kemler-pc-american-civil-liberties/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (4th Cir. 1996).

We conclude that\nfederal forfeiture law supersedes Georgia's statutory protections for\nIRAs. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to\nmodify its restraining order.\n\nV.
