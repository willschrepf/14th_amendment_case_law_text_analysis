Because the trial court correctly determined that the parties‟\nagreement did not give rise to any fiduciary duties, we affirm the judgment. We also\naffirm the postjudgment order awarding Paramount attorney‟s fees.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       In December 2006, Marathon Funding, LLC, agreed to invest in a slate of\n14 motion pictures to be produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures Corporation,\nincluding what would become the Oscar winner for best picture in 2007 – “No Country\nFor Old Men” – which starred Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. Pursuant to that\nagreement, Paramount issued an accounting statement to Marathon in late 2009 that\ndeducted a little more than $2 million from Marathon‟s account. Marathon later\ndetermined that Paramount did so to cover a portion of a $15 million payment Paramount\nmade to Jones due to a drafting error Paramount made in its contract with Jones.\n       Marathon sued Paramount for breach of fiduciary duty, contending that Paramount\nshould not have charged Marathon for Paramount‟s error. The trial court granted\nParamount‟s motion to hold a bench trial, not a jury trial, finding that this was the proper\ncourse because the gist of Marathon‟s action was equitable in nature. The parties\nstipulated that no extrinsic evidence would be introduced concerning the formation or\ninterpretation of the investment agreement, and that no extrinsic evidence would be\nintroduced concerning their conduct under that agreement except as to the accounting\ncharges that were made. In addition, Marathon stipulated to the facts it characterized as\nundisputed in response to Paramount‟s earlier unsuccessful motion for summary\njudgment.\n       The facts showed that Paramount and Marathon signed a “Multi-Picture\nInvestment Agreement” dated December 15, 2006, that called for Marathon to invest in a\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fslate of Paramount motion pictures, including “No Country For Old Men”.1 Marathon is\na Delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place of business in New York\nState, and was formed by Morgan Stanley Asset Funding, LLC, a subsidiary of the\ninternational investment bank Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley put up $150 million\nthrough a separate agency it created to finance Marathon‟s investment. Morgan Stanley\nalso acted as the exclusive agent for refinancing of that credit by allowing other investors,\nincluding financial institutions and hedge funds, to invest in Marathon‟s right to receive\nprofit payments under the investment agreement.\n       Under the investment agreement, Marathon received a 50 percent share of\nParamount‟s copyright interest in each of the movies covered by the agreement (the\ncovered pictures). Because other financing was obtained for No Country, Marathon and\nParamount each ended up with a 25 percent share of that film‟s copyright while the\nremaining 50 percent went to the new investor, Disney/Miramax. Marathon‟s\n“Investment Price” in each movie was based on its proportional copyright share of the\nmovie‟s estimated production costs. In exchange, Marathon would receive the same\nproportional percentage of each movie‟s net receipts. Paramount was responsible for all\nthe marketing and distribution costs of the covered pictures, which, because of their low-\nbudget nature, greatly exceeded the actual production costs. Paramount would advance\nall direct costs for the movies and, “[a]s between Paramount and Investor, Paramount\nshall control all decisions (i.e., business, creative, or otherwise) relating to the\ndevelopment and production of each Covered Picture as well as the decisions whether to\npursue and consummate any Co-Financing Transaction, and Investor shall have no\nconsultation or approval rights thereto.”\n       The term “net receipts” was contractually defined to mean the gross receipts from\nthe distribution and exhibition of a movie, minus deductions for certain expenses and\nfees, including third party profit participation payments that might be owed to the\n\n1      Some of the movies, like “No Country For Old Men,” had already been made,\nwhile others had not. For ease of reference we will refer to that motion picture as No\nCountry.\n\n                                               3\n\fdirector, producers, or certain actors.2 Jones‟s contract for No Country included a type of\nthird party profit clause known as a box office bonus which is at the heart of the present\nlitigation. So too did the contracts of directors Joel and Ethan Coen and producer Scott\nRudin. These talent contracts were negotiated in early 2006, well before the investment\nagreement was signed. Production of No Country had also concluded before the\ninvestment agreement was signed.\n       The box office bonuses negotiated for Jones, Rudin, and the Coen Brothers\nprovided that each would receive fixed bonuses when either the domestic box office\nreceipts reached certain levels, or when worldwide box office receipts reached twice the\ndomestic level. Paramount hired outside legal counsel to prepare agreements that\nconformed with the negotiated terms, as reflected in deal memos provided by\nParamount‟s in-house negotiator. However, the lawyer mistakenly drafted the\nagreements to provide that bonuses would be paid once worldwide box office receipts,\nwhen multiplied by two, reached the levels prescribed for domestic box office bonuses.\nAs a result, the contracts between Paramount on the one hand, and Jones, Rudin, and the\nCoen Brothers on the other hand, provided for an unintended increase in their bonus\ncompensation.3\n       Outside counsel discovered her mistake in June 2006 but apparently did not notify\nParamount. Although drafts of the agreements were distributed to various departments\nwithin Paramount, including to the legal department and the contract negotiator, a highly-\nplaced Paramount legal executive testified that it was not Paramount‟s policy to review\nsuch drafts to be sure they were consistent with the negotiated terms. Instead, Paramount\nrelied on its outside counsel, whom it had used without problems before. According to\n\n\n2      The formula was more complicated than this, and included something called an\nInvestor Corridor Payment, which was a percentage of gross receipts that would be paid\nas an advance against net receipts. The full details of this formula are irrelevant to the\nissues on appeal.\n\n3      The attorney made another error that inflated their share of home video revenues,\nbut that error did not affect Marathon and is therefore not relevant to the issues on appeal.\n\n                                              4\n\fParamount, it did not discover the errors until 2008, at about the same time as did one of\nRudin‟s attorneys.\n       Once Paramount learned of the error in the box office bonus provision, it\ncontacted Rudin, Jones, and the Coen Brothers. Rudin and the Coen Brothers\nacknowledged that the provision as it appeared in the contract did not reflect the terms\nthey had in fact negotiated and agreed to reform their contracts accordingly. Jones\nrefused to do so, and the dispute was eventually heard by a panel of arbitrators, who ruled\n2-1 in Jones‟s favor.\n       Under the higher, erroneous, formula, Jones was entitled to a box office bonus of\n$17.5 million. According to Carmen Desiderio, Paramount‟s senior vice president in\ncharge of contract accounting, if the correct formula had been applied, Jones would have\nbeen entitled to a box office bonus of just under $5 million as of October 2011. That\nfigure would have increased over time, however, Desiderio testified. Using Paramount‟s\nstandard accounting methodology, Desiderio testified that Jones would most likely have\nearned an additional $1.7 million in box office bonus compensation over the movie‟s 10-\nyear life cycle. Because Paramount had already paid Jones $2.5 million of his box office\nbonus, Paramount paid him another $15 million to make up the difference. That figure\ncapped the total amount of such compensation Jones could receive, however. As a result,\nJones was compensated more than $10 million above what he would have received\nabsent the contract drafting error.\n       After obtaining a settlement of $2.75 million from its outside counsel‟s law firm,\nParamount used that figure to reduce for accounting purposes to its investors the amount\nof box office bonus paid to Jones, and then allocated the reduced amount among itself\nand the investors according to their proportional ownership interests in the copyright for\nNo Country. As a result, Marathon was charged approximately $2 million more than it\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fwould have been had the error not occurred.4 Marathon did receive more than\n$12 million from Paramount for its investment in No Country, however.\n       The investment agreement contained three provisions that disclaimed the existence\nof either a partnership or of any fiduciary duties by Paramount. Paragraph 8, captioned\n“HOLDING OF FUNDS”, stated that “Paramount . . . shall not be considered a trustee\npledgeholder, fiduciary or agent of Investor by reason of anything done or any money\ncollected by it, and shall not be obligated to segregate receipts of the Covered Pictures\nfrom its other funds.” Paragraph 14, captioned “Tax Matters,” states that “Paramount and\nInvestor intend and agree that neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated\nherein shall be treated as or give rise to a partnership for federal income tax purposes or\nany other purpose.” Exhibit B to the investment agreement included section “III.\nACCOUNTING,” which applied to accounting statements and allocation of funds to\nMarathon. Under subdivision G. of this section, beneath the caption “Creditor-Debtor”, it\nsaid that “There is a creditor-debtor relationship between Paramount and Investor with\nrespect to the payment of amounts due Investor under the Agreement and nothing\n\n4      Marathon contends the figure is higher, but the difference is not important to our\nanalysis. We also note that paragraph 4.1 of the investment agreement expressly\npermitted Paramount to deduct from its gross receipts calculations the amount of any\nexpenditures or liabilities it incurred in connection with a covered picture. (Italics\nadded.) Paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 gave Marathon the right to audit financial records and\nrelated agreements for covered pictures, rights which were spelled out in Schedule B.\nUnder “NET PRODUCTION INVESTMENT AUDITS”, audit information was to\ninclude “[c]ontracts for all „above the line‟ personnel entitled to receive main title credit.”\nA sample exhibit (Exhibit X-1) that listed the information supplied to the auditor\nincluded a statement that the auditor “obtained and read contracts for significant above-\nthe-line talent (writers, producers, directors or actors earning more than US $100,000 in\nbasic compensation throughout the entire production as identified to us by Paramount\nmanagement) and verified that the contracts were signed and payments reflected in the\nProduction Cost Detail Report agree with the terms of those contracts.” This meant that\nMarathon could have inspected the Jones contract if it had wanted to. Finally,\nparagraph 11.2 stated that Paramount had not made any express or implied warranties or\nrepresentations concerning the amount of money any of the movies might make or that\nthere would be any money payable to Marathon at all, and that Marathon would not\n“make any claim that Paramount has failed to realize receipts or revenues which should\nor could have been realized in connection with the Covered Pictures . . . .”\n\n                                              6\n\fcontained in the Agreement shall be construed to create an agency, trust or fiduciary\nobligation with respect to such amounts . . . .”\n       Marathon contended that the investment agreement gave rise to a joint venture\nbetween it and Paramount, which therefore made Paramount its fiduciary. Marathon also\ncontended that a fiduciary duty arose from the fact that it entrusted its money with\nParamount and gave Paramount full control over the use of those funds. According to\nMarathon, Paramount breached its fiduciary duty in several ways: By failing to catch the\nbox office bonus drafting error in Jones‟s contract; by not notifying Marathon once\nParamount learned of the error, even throughout the arbitration with Jones; by rejecting\nJones‟s $3 million settlement offer; by not pursuing a legal malpractice claim against\nanother lawyer who worked on the Jones compensation agreement; and by not disclosing\nin its accounting statement why it had deducted the sum of money that Marathon later\nlearned was attributable to the drafting error in the Jones contract.\n       The trial court never reached those issues, however, finding instead that, under\nNew York law, the investment agreement‟s disclaimers of fiduciary duty were effective\nbecause the agreement did not operate to create a joint venture. The trial court later\ngranted Paramount‟s posttrial motion for attorney‟s fees, awarding it more than $690,000.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n1.     New York Law Applied to Interpretation of the Investment Agreement\n\n       The investment agreement stated that “THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT\nSHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nLAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE\nWITHIN, AND TO BE PERFORMED WITHIN, SUCH STATE, EXCLUDING\nCHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE\nAPPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN NEW\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fYORK.”5 Pursuant to this provision, the trial court applied New York law when\nconstruing that agreement. Marathon contends the trial court erred by doing so.\n       Marathon‟s primary argument is based on the applicability of Nedlloyd Lines B.V.\nv. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal.4th 459 (Nedlloyd). The Nedlloyd court considered a\nchoice of law provision in a stock purchase agreement, which stated, “This agreement\nshall be governed by and construed in accordance with Hong Kong law and each party\nhereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and service of process of the\nHong Kong courts.” (Id. at p. 463.) The Supreme Court rejected a claim that the\nprovision did not apply to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the theory that\nsuch a claim was independent of the shareholders‟ agreement and outside the intended\nscope of the clause. The Supreme Court applied Hong Kong law. Marathon contends\nthat Nedlloyd does not apply to its fiduciary duty claim because the choice of law\nprovision in the investment agreement with Paramount –stating that “the terms of this\nagreement” would be construed under New York law – is narrower than the one at issue\nin Nedlloyd – which stated that “this agreement” (not “the terms of this agreement”)\nwould be construed under another forum‟s law. We disagree.6\n       Nedlloyd held that “[w]hen two sophisticated, commercial entities agree to a\nchoice-of-law clause like the one in this case, the most reasonable interpretation of their\nactions is that they intended for the clause to apply to all causes of action arising from or\nrelated to their contract.” (Nedlloyd, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 468.) In reaching this\nconclusion, the Nedlloyd court focused on the provision‟s statement that the agreement\nwould be “governed by” Hong Kong law. That phrase “is a broad one signifying a\nrelationship of absolute direction, control, and restraint. Thus, the clause reflects the\nparties‟ clear contemplation that „the agreement‟ is to be completely and absolutely\n\n5       The agreement also provided for the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the New York\nstate courts or of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\n6      We apply California law because the parties have never addressed the applicable\nNew York law and have instead relied solely on the law of California. (Nedlloyd, supra,\n3 Cal.4th at p. 469, fn. 7.)\n\n                                              8\n\fcontrolled by Hong Kong law. No exceptions are provided.” (Id. at p. 469.) Because the\ndefendant‟s alleged fiduciary duties could arise and exist only because of the parties‟\nagreement, Hong Kong law must govern the legal duties “created by or emanating from”\nthat agreement in order to completely control the agreement of the parties. (Ibid.)\n       This conclusion “comports with common sense and commercial reality,” the\nNedlloyd court held, because no “rational businessperson[] attempting to provide by\ncontract for an efficient and business-like resolution of possible future disputes, would\nintend that the laws of multiple jurisdictions would apply to a single controversy having\nits origin in a single, contract-based relationship.” (Nedlloyd, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 469.)\n       We see no meaningful difference between the choice-of-law provision at issue\nhere and the one at issue in Nedlloyd. Construing “this agreement” necessarily includes\nconstruing its terms. Most important, the Nedlloyd court focused on the phrase\n“governed by,” which is also present in the investment agreement with Paramount. As in\nNedlloyd, the agreement was made by sophisticated commercial entities. In order to\ngovern their agreement, New York law must apply to Marathon‟s breach of fiduciary\nduty claim, which is both created by and emanates from the investment agreement. 7\n       Marathon challenges the choice-of-law ruling on two other grounds that appear to\nstem from Nedlloyd. The Nedlloyd court established certain guidelines for trial courts to\nfollow when determining whether a contractual choice of law provision is enforceable.\nThe court must first determine whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to\nthe parties or their transaction, or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the\nparties‟ choice of law. If neither test is met, the court need not enforce the choice of law\nprovision. (Nedlloyd, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 466.) If either test is met, however, the court\nmust then determine whether the chosen state‟s law is contrary to a fundamental policy of\nCalifornia. If no such conflict exists, then the court shall enforce the choice of law\nprovision. If there is a fundamental conflict with California law, the court must then\n\n7      Marathon relies on the dissent in Nedlloyd to undermine its rationale. Even a\nstrongly worded dissent such as the one in Nedlloyd does not negate our duty to abide by\nthe majority ruling.\n\n                                              9\n\fdetermine whether California has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the\ndetermination of the particular issue. The choice of law provision will not be enforced if\nCalifornia has such an interest. (Ibid.)\n       Marathon contends that the New York choice of law provision is not enforceable\nbecause: (1) Paramount has its principal place of business in California and the actions\ngiving rise to the complaint took place in California; and (2) Marathon filed suit in\nCalifornia and is therefore entitled to the application of California law “as a matter of\nCalifornia public policy.” Although Marathon does not cite Nedlloyd or any other\nauthority to back up these contentions, we view them as an attempt to assert Nedlloyd’s\ntests concerning whether there is a substantial relationship between the parties or their\ntransaction to New York law and whether the choice-of-law provision is contrary to a\nfundamental policy of California law.\n       As to the first, Marathon‟s principal place of business is in New York state, as is\nthe parent company of Paramount, Viacom, Inc. Thus, there is a substantial relationship\nbetween the parties and New York. As to the second, Marathon never invokes the term\n“fundamental” when mentioning California policy, and never identifies such a policy.\nWe therefore deem that issue waived. (Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist. (1995)\n39 Cal.App.4th 691, 699-700.) Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err\nby applying New York law to this dispute.\n\n2.     Paramount Was Not a Fiduciary\n\n       Focusing primarily on California law, Marathon contends that Paramount was its\nfiduciary because the investment agreement effectively created a joint venture that\novercame the contractual disclaimers of fiduciary duty, or because Paramount‟s exclusive\ncontrol over Marathon‟s funds gave rise to such a duty, where Marathon reposed trust\nand confidence in Paramount. As previously noted, however, New York law applies to\nthis dispute, making California law inapplicable. Because the parties agree that there was\nno disputed evidence concerning the proper interpretation of the investment agreement,\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fwe exercise our independent review when construing its provisions. (Ditmars-31 Street\nDevelopment Corp. v. Punia (1962) 17 A.D.2d 357, 361 [235 N.Y.S.2d 796].)\n       The language of a contract must be given a practical interpretation in order to meet\nthe reasonable expectations of the parties. (Petracca v. Petracca (N.Y.A.D. 2003) 756\nN.Y.S.2d 587 [302 A.D.2d 576, 576-577].) The contract must be read as a whole and, if\npossible, interpreted to give effect to its general purpose. Particular words should not be\nisolated from the whole, but must be considered in context. (William C. Atwater & Co. v.\nPanama R. Co. (N.Y. 1927) 264 N.Y. 519, 524 [159 N.E. 418, 419].) The court‟s role is\nto ascertain the parties‟ intent at the time they entered the contract, which, if it is not\nambiguous, may be determined from the plain language of their agreement. (Evans v.\nFamous Music Corp. (Ct. App. 2004) 1 N.Y.3d 452, 458 [775 N.Y.S.2d 757].)\n       Under New York law, joint venturers are fiduciaries. (Solutia, Inc. v. FMC Corp.\n(S.D.N.Y. 2006) 456 F.Supp.2d 429, 442-443.) There are five requirements to the\nformation of a joint venture in New York: (1) two or more persons must enter into a\nspecific agreement to carry on an enterprise for profit; (2) their agreement must evidence\ntheir intent to be joint venturers; (3) each must contribute property, financing, skill,\nknowledge, or effort; (4) each must have some degree of control over the venture; and\n(5) there must be a provision for the sharing of both profits and losses. (Id. at p. 445.)8\nNothing in the investment agreement shows the intent to create a joint venture. To the\ncontrary, the agreement states in several places that the parties disclaimed any fiduciary\nduties or agency, trustee, and partnership relationships. The investment agreement also\n\n\n\n\n8      California law is substantially the same. The existence of a joint venture depends\non the intention of the parties and requires a joint interest in a common business, an\nunderstanding that profits and losses will be shared, and a right to joint control.\n(580 Folsom Associates v. Prometheus Development Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1, 15-\n16.)\n\n\n                                               11\n\fexpressly deprives Marathon of any control whatsoever concerning the covered pictures.\nTherefore no joint venture was created under New York law.9\n       Any other potential bases for the existence of a fiduciary duty are negated by the\ninvestment agreement‟s express disclaimers that no such relationship was created. Under\nNew York law, explicit and unambiguous disclaimers of a fiduciary relationship are\nenforceable. (BNP Paribas Mortg. Corp. v. Bank of America (S.D.N.Y. 2012)\n866 F.Supp.2d 257, 269; Valentini v. Citigroup, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. 2011) 837 F.Supp.2d 304,\n326; Levine v. Murray Hill Manor Co. (A.D. 1 Dept. 1988) 143 A.D.2d 298, 300 [532\nN.Y.S.2d 130]; Cathy Daniels, Ltd. v. Weingast (2012) 91 A.D.3d 431, 433 [936\nN.Y.S.2d 44].) Parties in nonfiduciary relationships are free to contractually waive\nprospective fiduciary duties to one another. (Cooper v. Parsky (2nd Cir. 1998) 140 F.3d\n433, 439 [agreement by which shareholders gave corporate directors right to cast proxy\nvotes of their shares; express disclaimer of fiduciary duty and limitation of liability to\ngross negligence or willful misconduct enforced]; Solutia, Inc. v. FMC Corp., supra,\n456 F.Supp.2d at pp. 446-447.)10\n       Marathon relies on a pair of older New York decisions to show that Paramount\nwas its fiduciary – Martin v. Peyton (N.Y. 1927) 246 N.Y. 213 [158 N.E. 77] (Martin)\nand Rubenstein v. Small (N.Y.A.D. 1947) 273 A.D. 102 [75 N.Y.S.2d 483] (Rubenstein).\nNeither alters our conclusion.\n\n9      Paramount contends there was no true sharing of profits and losses because\nParamount paid for all the distribution costs, which greatly exceeded the production costs\nof the covered pictures, and because Marathon was not required to pay more than the\ninvestment price for any covered picture even if the film lost money. Based on our\nholding that a joint venture was not created because the agreement does not evidence\nsuch an intent and because Marathon had no control over the enterprise, we need not\nreach that issue.\n\n10      The flip side of these decisions is found in N.E. General Corp. v. Wellington Adv.\n(N.Y. 1993) 82 N.Y.2d 158 [624 N.E.2d 129]. In that case, New York‟s highest state\ncourt held that although parties are free to contract for the existence of fiduciary duties\namong themselves, unless the relationship between the parties is fiduciary as a matter of\nlaw, the courts should not impose such duties if the parties have not done so themselves.\n(Id. at pp. 131-133.)\n\n                                              12\n\f       At issue in Martin was whether the trial court properly sustained demurrers to a\ncomplaint on the ground that the defendants were not partners of a brokerage firm to\nwhich they had loaned money. In affirming that order, the Martin court noted that the\nloan agreement which was the source of the alleged partnership disclaimed any such\nrelationship. However, disclaimers of that type might be a sham, the court observed, and\nthe true nature of the parties‟ business relationship was to be determined by the terms and\neffect of their agreement. (Martin, supra, 158 N.E. 77 at p. 78.) Even though the loan\nagreement imposed a complex of arrangements giving the defendants substantial control\nover the firm and its principals, the court concluded that no partnership had been formed.\n(Id. at pp. 79-80.)\n       The plaintiff in Rubenstein loaned money to the producer of a vaudeville show,\nwith repayment to come from unused loans, advances, and the excess of gross receipts\nover production costs and operating expenses, if any. Instead of interest, the plaintiff\nwould be paid 10 percent of the net receipts. The defendant was supposed to furnish\nregular detailed financial statements showing costs, expenditures, and receipts. The\nagreement indicated that other parties might loan money to the production on the same\nterms. It also stated that the parties were not partners, joint venturers, or principal and\nagent. When the defendant refused to pay back any of the loan funds or to provide an\naccounting, the plaintiff brought an equitable action for an accounting. The trial court\nsustained the defendant‟s demurrer on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate\nremedy at law.\n       The Rubenstein court reversed. First, in reliance on Martin, supra, 158 N.E. 77, it\nheld that the disclaimer of a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship was not\ndeterminative, leaving it free to examine the true nature of the parties‟ relationship.\n(Rubenstein, supra, 75 N.Y.S.2d at p. 485.) Next, it held that the agreement did not\ncreate a true debtor-creditor relationship because the possibility that the plaintiff might\nnot be repaid meant he had not made a true loan of money. (Id. at pp. 485-486.) Instead,\na fiduciary relationship respecting the use of plaintiff‟s funds was created, placing on\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fdefendant the duty to account for his use of the funds. Therefore, a cause of action for\nthe equitable remedy of accounting had been pled. (Id. at p. 486.)\n       From Martin, supra, 158 N.E. 77, and Rubenstein, supra, 75 N.Y.S.2d 483, we\nderive the rule that despite any contractual disclaimers to the contrary, fiduciary\nrelationships such as that of partners or joint venturers may be created by the operative\neffect of the parties‟ agreement. As we have already held, however, nothing in the\ninvestment agreement here gave rise to a joint venture under New York law.\n       The investment agreement here spelled out the nature and effect of Marathon‟s\ninvestment in the various covered pictures. Those terms also supplied a formula by\nwhich Marathon might receive a return on its investments, along with Paramount‟s\nexpress duty to provide an accounting. Those same terms also clearly and explicitly\nstated that no fiduciary duties were created by the investment agreement.11 Based on this,\nwe conclude that neither Martin nor Rubenstein is applicable, and that Marathon‟s\nexpress waiver of any fiduciary duties by Paramount was effective.12\n\n\n11      At oral argument, Marathon relied on our recent decision in Cleveland v. Johnson\n(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1315, where we held there was substantial evidence to support a\njury‟s verdict that a business promoter owed, and breached, his fiduciary duty to\ninvestors by using their money to fund a successor business after the one in which they\ninvested had failed. We reject Marathon‟s reliance on this decision for several reasons.\nFirst, we are applying New York law, not California law. Second, the agreement did not\ninclude the disclaimers of fiduciary duty found here or in the New York decisions we\nhave cited. Third, the agreement in Cleveland was not between sophisticated entities\nrepresented by counsel, and did not include the disclaimers of fiduciary duty present here\nor in decisions like City of Hope National Medical Center v. Genentech, Inc. (2008)\n43 Cal.4th 375, 387, as we noted in Cleveland. Fourth, in Cleveland, we held that the\nrelationship imposed fiduciary duties as a matter of law because for all intents and\npurposes, the plaintiffs were stockholders, as to whom promoters owe fiduciary duties.\n(Cleveland at pp. 1342-1343.) There is no promoter-stockholder relationship here.\n\n12     Because we affirm the judgment on the ground no fiduciary duty existed, we need\nnot reach Marathon‟s contentions that Paramount in fact breached its fiduciary duties,\nthat Marathon is entitled as a matter of law to judgment in the sum of more than\n$3.6 million, and that we should remand the matter for a new trial as to punitive damages.\n\n\n                                             14\n\f3.     Marathon Was Not Wrongfully Deprived of Its Right to a Jury Trial\n\n       Paramount brought a pretrial motion to have this action decided at a court trial, not\nby a jury, on two grounds: (1) the breach of fiduciary duty claim was equitable in\nnature, meaning no jury trial was warranted; and (2) no jury trial was required because\nthere would be no extrinsic, disputed evidence concerning the interpretation of the\ninvestment agreement, making the matter one for the court, not a jury. The trial court\ngranted the motion on the first ground. Marathon contends the trial court erred.13\n       Rather than parse more than 100 years of jurisprudence concerning the nature of\nactions in equity, law, or chancery, we choose to affirm on the alternative ground for\nParamount‟s bench trial motion: that no jury was required because at issue was the\ninterpretation of a contract based solely on the contract terms and certain undisputed\nbackground facts, which are questions of law for a court to decide. In such a case, there\nis no right to have a jury resolve the dispute. (Garcia v. Truck Insurance Exchange\n(1984) 36 Cal.3d 426, 439; Oceanside 84, Ltd. v. Fidelity Federal Bank (1997)\n56 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1451.) Because that was the case here, we agree with Paramount\nthat Marathon was not entitled to a jury trial. Furthermore, Marathon did not address this\nissue in either its opening appellate brief, or, after respondent‟s brief did so, in appellant‟s\nreply brief. As a result, we affirm the trial court‟s order on the alternative ground that the\nissue has been waived. (Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist., supra, 39 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 699-700.)\n\n4.     Attorney’s Fees\n\n       The investment agreement provided that costs and reasonable attorney‟s fees\nwould be awarded to the prevailing party in “any action, suit, or other proceeding [that] is\ninstituted concerning or arising out of this agreement.” Marathon challenges the trial\n\n13     On September 28, 2011, we summarily denied Marathon‟s writ petition\nchallenging the trial court‟s bench trial order. Our summary denial was not law of the\ncase and did not preclude us from considering the issue once again. (Frisk v. Superior\nCourt (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 402, 415.)\n\n                                              15\n\fcourt‟s order awarding Paramount attorney‟s fees of more than $690,000 on two grounds:\n(1) the attorney‟s fee provision in the investment agreement was not broad enough to\ncover the tort claim for breach of fiduciary duty; and (2) the amount awarded was\nexcessive. We take each in turn.\n       Marathon relies on Kangarlou v. Progressive Title Co., Inc. (2005)\n128 Cal.App.4th 1174, for the proposition that tort claims such as breach of fiduciary\nduty do not enforce a contract and are not considered actions on a contract for purposes\nof the reciprocal attorney‟s fee provision found at Civil Code section 1717.\n       The plaintiff in Kangarlou was a home buyer who sued her real estate agent, real\nestate broker, and escrow company for breach of fiduciary duty in several respects:\nfailing to obtain evidence that a broker was regularly licensed before delivering\ncompensation to him, communicating to her facts learned about the escrow instructions\nor the broker‟s license, exercising reasonable skill and diligence in carrying out the\nescrow instructions, and strictly complying with her written instructions concerning the\ndelivery or money or documents at the close of escrow. The jury found for the plaintiff\nand the trial court awarded her attorney‟s fees under a provision in the escrow agreement\nwhich provided that if the plaintiff failed to pay fees or expenses due under the escrow\ninstructions, she agreed “to pay the attorney‟s fees and costs incurred to collect such fees\nor expenses.”\n       Under Civil Code section 1717, that one-sided fee provision gave the plaintiff the\nreciprocal right to recover fees in actions on, or to enforce, the contract. Although tort\nclaims do not ordinarily “enforce” contract terms, some tort claims may also constitute a\nbreach of contract as well. (Kangarlou, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1178.) Because the\nfiduciary duties which underlay the plaintiff‟s claim arose out her contract, the court held\nthat her tort claim was on the contract for purposes of awarding attorney‟s fees under\nCivil Code section 1717. (Kangarlou, at p. 1179.)\n       As we read Kangarlou, it actually undercuts Marathon‟s contention. Marathon‟s\nfiduciary duty claim against Paramount was based on duties that arose under the contract:\nto account for and pay all sums owed pursuant to the investment agreement‟s provisions.\n\n\n                                             16\n\fRegardless, we are reviewing a far broader provision than the one in Kangarlou. Here,\nthe parties agreed to pay fees to the party who prevailed on actions arising out of their\ncontract. Such broadly worded provisions are construed to encompass tort claims\n(Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 607) and we therefore reject Marathon‟s\ncontention.\n       As for the size of the award, Paramount requested fees of $768,948.40, but the\ntrial court, after reviewing the billing records submitted in support of the fee motion,\ndetermined that some of the time billed was duplicative and excessive. The trial court\ntherefore reduced the award to $690,548.80. The trial court also found that the hourly\nrates being charged – ranging from $192 to $587 for lawyers and $60 to $150 for\nparalegals – was reasonable. Marathon contends the fee award is still too high because it\nrepresents 1,974 hours of lawyers‟ time, an amount that Marathon believes is excessive\nand unreasonable.14\n       We review the trial court‟s order under the abuse of discretion standard, keeping in\nmind that the experienced trial judge is in the best position to determine the value of legal\nservices rendered in his court. (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)\n144 Cal.App.4th 140, 148-149.) We make all reasonable presumptions in favor of the\ntrial court‟s order where the record is silent, and Marathon has the burden of\naffirmatively showing error, along with a record adequate to do so. (Ketchum v. Moses\n(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1140-1141.) Marathon does not point to a single instance where\nthe billing records show an unreasonable, unnecessary, or duplicative charge. As a result,\nit has failed to carry its burden of affirmatively showing error and, under the applicable\nstandard of review, we defer to the trial court‟s reasoned assessment of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n14    On appeal, Marathon does not challenge the hourly rates claimed by Paramount‟s\nlawyers.\n\n                                             17\n\f                                       DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment and the postjudgment order awarding Paramount its attorney‟s fees\nare affirmed. Respondent Paramount shall recover its appellate costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                RUBIN, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n             BIGELOW, P.

Because the trial court correctly determined that the parties‟\nagreement did not give rise to any fiduciary duties, we affirm the judgment. We also\naffirm the postjudgment order awarding Paramount attorney‟s fees.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       In December 2006, Marathon Funding, LLC, agreed to invest in a slate of\n14 motion pictures to be produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures Corporation,\nincluding what would become the Oscar winner for best picture in 2007 – “No Country\nFor Old Men” – which starred Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. Pursuant to that\nagreement, Paramount issued an accounting statement to Marathon in late 2009 that\ndeducted a little more than $2 million from Marathon‟s account. Marathon later\ndetermined that Paramount did so to cover a portion of a $15 million payment Paramount\nmade to Jones due to a drafting error Paramount made in its contract with Jones.\n       Marathon sued Paramount for breach of fiduciary duty, contending that Paramount\nshould not have charged Marathon for Paramount‟s error. The trial court granted\nParamount‟s motion to hold a bench trial, not a jury trial, finding that this was the proper\ncourse because the gist of Marathon‟s action was equitable in nature. The parties\nstipulated that no extrinsic evidence would be introduced concerning the formation or\ninterpretation of the investment agreement, and that no extrinsic evidence would be\nintroduced concerning their conduct under that agreement except as to the accounting\ncharges that were made. In addition, Marathon stipulated to the facts it characterized as\nundisputed in response to Paramount‟s earlier unsuccessful motion for summary\njudgment.\n       The facts showed that Paramount and Marathon signed a “Multi-Picture\nInvestment Agreement” dated December 15, 2006, that called for Marathon to invest in a\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fslate of Paramount motion pictures, including “No Country For Old Men”.1 Marathon is\na Delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place of business in New York\nState, and was formed by Morgan Stanley Asset Funding, LLC, a subsidiary of the\ninternational investment bank Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley put up $150 million\nthrough a separate agency it created to finance Marathon‟s investment. Morgan Stanley\nalso acted as the exclusive agent for refinancing of that credit by allowing other investors,\nincluding financial institutions and hedge funds, to invest in Marathon‟s right to receive\nprofit payments under the investment agreement.\n       Under the investment agreement, Marathon received a 50 percent share of\nParamount‟s copyright interest in each of the movies covered by the agreement (the\ncovered pictures). Because other financing was obtained for No Country, Marathon and\nParamount each ended up with a 25 percent share of that film‟s copyright while the\nremaining 50 percent went to the new investor, Disney/Miramax. Marathon‟s\n“Investment Price” in each movie was based on its proportional copyright share of the\nmovie‟s estimated production costs. In exchange, Marathon would receive the same\nproportional percentage of each movie‟s net receipts. Paramount was responsible for all\nthe marketing and distribution costs of the covered pictures, which, because of their low-\nbudget nature, greatly exceeded the actual production costs. Paramount would advance\nall direct costs for the movies and, “[a]s between Paramount and Investor, Paramount\nshall control all decisions (i.e., business, creative, or otherwise) relating to the\ndevelopment and production of each Covered Picture as well as the decisions whether to\npursue and consummate any Co-Financing Transaction, and Investor shall have no\nconsultation or approval rights thereto.”\n       The term “net receipts” was contractually defined to mean the gross receipts from\nthe distribution and exhibition of a movie, minus deductions for certain expenses and\nfees, including third party profit participation payments that might be owed to the\n\n1      Some of the movies, like “No Country For Old Men,” had already been made,\nwhile others had not. For ease of reference we will refer to that motion picture as No\nCountry.\n\n                                               3\n\fdirector, producers, or certain actors.2 Jones‟s contract for No Country included a type of\nthird party profit clause known as a box office bonus which is at the heart of the present\nlitigation. So too did the contracts of directors Joel and Ethan Coen and producer Scott\nRudin. These talent contracts were negotiated in early 2006, well before the investment\nagreement was signed. Production of No Country had also concluded before the\ninvestment agreement was signed.\n       The box office bonuses negotiated for Jones, Rudin, and the Coen Brothers\nprovided that each would receive fixed bonuses when either the domestic box office\nreceipts reached certain levels, or when worldwide box office receipts reached twice the\ndomestic level. Paramount hired outside legal counsel to prepare agreements that\nconformed with the negotiated terms, as reflected in deal memos provided by\nParamount‟s in-house negotiator. However, the lawyer mistakenly drafted the\nagreements to provide that bonuses would be paid once worldwide box office receipts,\nwhen multiplied by two, reached the levels prescribed for domestic box office bonuses.\nAs a result, the contracts between Paramount on the one hand, and Jones, Rudin, and the\nCoen Brothers on the other hand, provided for an unintended increase in their bonus\ncompensation.3\n       Outside counsel discovered her mistake in June 2006 but apparently did not notify\nParamount. Although drafts of the agreements were distributed to various departments\nwithin Paramount, including to the legal department and the contract negotiator, a highly-\nplaced Paramount legal executive testified that it was not Paramount‟s policy to review\nsuch drafts to be sure they were consistent with the negotiated terms. Instead, Paramount\nrelied on its outside counsel, whom it had used without problems before. According to\n\n\n2      The formula was more complicated than this, and included something called an\nInvestor Corridor Payment, which was a percentage of gross receipts that would be paid\nas an advance against net receipts. The full details of this formula are irrelevant to the\nissues on appeal.\n\n3      The attorney made another error that inflated their share of home video revenues,\nbut that error did not affect Marathon and is therefore not relevant to the issues on appeal.\n\n                                              4\n\fParamount, it did not discover the errors until 2008, at about the same time as did one of\nRudin‟s attorneys.\n       Once Paramount learned of the error in the box office bonus provision, it\ncontacted Rudin, Jones, and the Coen Brothers. Rudin and the Coen Brothers\nacknowledged that the provision as it appeared in the contract did not reflect the terms\nthey had in fact negotiated and agreed to reform their contracts accordingly. Jones\nrefused to do so, and the dispute was eventually heard by a panel of arbitrators, who ruled\n2-1 in Jones‟s favor.\n       Under the higher, erroneous, formula, Jones was entitled to a box office bonus of\n$17.5 million. According to Carmen Desiderio, Paramount‟s senior vice president in\ncharge of contract accounting, if the correct formula had been applied, Jones would have\nbeen entitled to a box office bonus of just under $5 million as of October 2011. That\nfigure would have increased over time, however, Desiderio testified. Using Paramount‟s\nstandard accounting methodology, Desiderio testified that Jones would most likely have\nearned an additional $1.7 million in box office bonus compensation over the movie‟s 10-\nyear life cycle. Because Paramount had already paid Jones $2.5 million of his box office\nbonus, Paramount paid him another $15 million to make up the difference. That figure\ncapped the total amount of such compensation Jones could receive, however. As a result,\nJones was compensated more than $10 million above what he would have received\nabsent the contract drafting error.\n       After obtaining a settlement of $2.75 million from its outside counsel‟s law firm,\nParamount used that figure to reduce for accounting purposes to its investors the amount\nof box office bonus paid to Jones, and then allocated the reduced amount among itself\nand the investors according to their proportional ownership interests in the copyright for\nNo Country. As a result, Marathon was charged approximately $2 million more than it\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fwould have been had the error not occurred.4 Marathon did receive more than\n$12 million from Paramount for its investment in No Country, however.\n       The investment agreement contained three provisions that disclaimed the existence\nof either a partnership or of any fiduciary duties by Paramount. Paragraph 8, captioned\n“HOLDING OF FUNDS”, stated that “Paramount . . . shall not be considered a trustee\npledgeholder, fiduciary or agent of Investor by reason of anything done or any money\ncollected by it, and shall not be obligated to segregate receipts of the Covered Pictures\nfrom its other funds.” Paragraph 14, captioned “Tax Matters,” states that “Paramount and\nInvestor intend and agree that neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated\nherein shall be treated as or give rise to a partnership for federal income tax purposes or\nany other purpose.” Exhibit B to the investment agreement included section “III.\nACCOUNTING,” which applied to accounting statements and allocation of funds to\nMarathon. Under subdivision G. of this section, beneath the caption “Creditor-Debtor”, it\nsaid that “There is a creditor-debtor relationship between Paramount and Investor with\nrespect to the payment of amounts due Investor under the Agreement and nothing\n\n4      Marathon contends the figure is higher, but the difference is not important to our\nanalysis. We also note that paragraph 4.1 of the investment agreement expressly\npermitted Paramount to deduct from its gross receipts calculations the amount of any\nexpenditures or liabilities it incurred in connection with a covered picture. (Italics\nadded.) Paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 gave Marathon the right to audit financial records and\nrelated agreements for covered pictures, rights which were spelled out in Schedule B.\nUnder “NET PRODUCTION INVESTMENT AUDITS”, audit information was to\ninclude “[c]ontracts for all „above the line‟ personnel entitled to receive main title credit.”\nA sample exhibit (Exhibit X-1) that listed the information supplied to the auditor\nincluded a statement that the auditor “obtained and read contracts for significant above-\nthe-line talent (writers, producers, directors or actors earning more than US $100,000 in\nbasic compensation throughout the entire production as identified to us by Paramount\nmanagement) and verified that the contracts were signed and payments reflected in the\nProduction Cost Detail Report agree with the terms of those contracts.” This meant that\nMarathon could have inspected the Jones contract if it had wanted to. Finally,\nparagraph 11.2 stated that Paramount had not made any express or implied warranties or\nrepresentations concerning the amount of money any of the movies might make or that\nthere would be any money payable to Marathon at all, and that Marathon would not\n“make any claim that Paramount has failed to realize receipts or revenues which should\nor could have been realized in connection with the Covered Pictures . . . .”\n\n                                              6\n\fcontained in the Agreement shall be construed to create an agency, trust or fiduciary\nobligation with respect to such amounts . . . .”\n       Marathon contended that the investment agreement gave rise to a joint venture\nbetween it and Paramount, which therefore made Paramount its fiduciary. Marathon also\ncontended that a fiduciary duty arose from the fact that it entrusted its money with\nParamount and gave Paramount full control over the use of those funds. According to\nMarathon, Paramount breached its fiduciary duty in several ways: By failing to catch the\nbox office bonus drafting error in Jones‟s contract; by not notifying Marathon once\nParamount learned of the error, even throughout the arbitration with Jones; by rejecting\nJones‟s $3 million settlement offer; by not pursuing a legal malpractice claim against\nanother lawyer who worked on the Jones compensation agreement; and by not disclosing\nin its accounting statement why it had deducted the sum of money that Marathon later\nlearned was attributable to the drafting error in the Jones contract.\n       The trial court never reached those issues, however, finding instead that, under\nNew York law, the investment agreement‟s disclaimers of fiduciary duty were effective\nbecause the agreement did not operate to create a joint venture. The trial court later\ngranted Paramount‟s posttrial motion for attorney‟s fees, awarding it more than $690,000.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n1.     New York Law Applied to Interpretation of the Investment Agreement\n\n       The investment agreement stated that “THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT\nSHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nLAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE\nWITHIN, AND TO BE PERFORMED WITHIN, SUCH STATE, EXCLUDING\nCHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE\nAPPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN NEW\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fYORK.”5 Pursuant to this provision, the trial court applied New York law when\nconstruing that agreement. Marathon contends the trial court erred by doing so.\n       Marathon‟s primary argument is based on the applicability of Nedlloyd Lines B.V.\nv. Superior Court (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1349036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1349036/nedlloyd-lines-bv-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Nedlloyd). The Nedlloyd court considered a\nchoice of law provision in a stock purchase agreement, which stated, “This agreement\nshall be governed by and construed in accordance with Hong Kong law and each party\nhereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and service of process of the\nHong Kong courts.” (Id. at p. 463.) The Supreme Court rejected a claim that the\nprovision did not apply to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the theory that\nsuch a claim was independent of the shareholders‟ agreement and outside the intended\nscope of the clause. The Supreme Court applied Hong Kong law. Marathon contends\nthat Nedlloyd does not apply to its fiduciary duty claim because the choice of law\nprovision in the investment agreement with Paramount –stating that “the terms of this\nagreement” would be construed under New York law – is narrower than the one at issue\nin Nedlloyd – which stated that “this agreement” (not “the terms of this agreement”)\nwould be construed under another forum‟s law. We disagree.6\n       Nedlloyd held that “[w]hen two sophisticated, commercial entities agree to a\nchoice-of-law clause like the one in this case, the most reasonable interpretation of their\nactions is that they intended for the clause to apply to all causes of action arising from or\nrelated to their contract.” (Nedlloyd, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 468.) In reaching this\nconclusion, the Nedlloyd court focused on the provision‟s statement that the agreement\nwould be “governed by” Hong Kong law. That phrase “is a broad one signifying a\nrelationship of absolute direction, control, and restraint. Thus, the clause reflects the\nparties‟ clear contemplation that „the agreement‟ is to be completely and absolutely\n\n5       The agreement also provided for the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the New York\nstate courts or of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\n6      We apply California law because the parties have never addressed the applicable\nNew York law and have instead relied solely on the law of California. (Nedlloyd, supra,\n3 Cal.4th at p. 469, fn. 7.)\n\n                                              8\n\fcontrolled by Hong Kong law. No exceptions are provided.” (Id. at p. 469.) Because the\ndefendant‟s alleged fiduciary duties could arise and exist only because of the parties‟\nagreement, Hong Kong law must govern the legal duties “created by or emanating from”\nthat agreement in order to completely control the agreement of the parties. (Ibid.)\n       This conclusion “comports with common sense and commercial reality,” the\nNedlloyd court held, because no “rational businessperson[] attempting to provide by\ncontract for an efficient and business-like resolution of possible future disputes, would\nintend that the laws of multiple jurisdictions would apply to a single controversy having\nits origin in a single, contract-based relationship.” (Nedlloyd, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 469.)\n       We see no meaningful difference between the choice-of-law provision at issue\nhere and the one at issue in Nedlloyd. Construing “this agreement” necessarily includes\nconstruing its terms. Most important, the Nedlloyd court focused on the phrase\n“governed by,” which is also present in the investment agreement with Paramount. As in\nNedlloyd, the agreement was made by sophisticated commercial entities. In order to\ngovern their agreement, New York law must apply to Marathon‟s breach of fiduciary\nduty claim, which is both created by and emanates from the investment agreement. 7\n       Marathon challenges the choice-of-law ruling on two other grounds that appear to\nstem from Nedlloyd. The Nedlloyd court established certain guidelines for trial courts to\nfollow when determining whether a contractual choice of law provision is enforceable.\nThe court must first determine whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to\nthe parties or their transaction, or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the\nparties‟ choice of law. If neither test is met, the court need not enforce the choice of law\nprovision. (Nedlloyd, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 466.) If either test is met, however, the court\nmust then determine whether the chosen state‟s law is contrary to a fundamental policy of\nCalifornia. If no such conflict exists, then the court shall enforce the choice of law\nprovision. If there is a fundamental conflict with California law, the court must then\n\n7      Marathon relies on the dissent in Nedlloyd to undermine its rationale. Even a\nstrongly worded dissent such as the one in Nedlloyd does not negate our duty to abide by\nthe majority ruling.\n\n                                              9\n\fdetermine whether California has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the\ndetermination of the particular issue. The choice of law provision will not be enforced if\nCalifornia has such an interest. (Ibid.)\n       Marathon contends that the New York choice of law provision is not enforceable\nbecause: (1) Paramount has its principal place of business in California and the actions\ngiving rise to the complaint took place in California; and (2) Marathon filed suit in\nCalifornia and is therefore entitled to the application of California law “as a matter of\nCalifornia public policy.” Although Marathon does not cite Nedlloyd or any other\nauthority to back up these contentions, we view them as an attempt to assert Nedlloyd’s\ntests concerning whether there is a substantial relationship between the parties or their\ntransaction to New York law and whether the choice-of-law provision is contrary to a\nfundamental policy of California law.\n       As to the first, Marathon‟s principal place of business is in New York state, as is\nthe parent company of Paramount, Viacom, Inc. Thus, there is a substantial relationship\nbetween the parties and New York. As to the second, Marathon never invokes the term\n“fundamental” when mentioning California policy, and never identifies such a policy.\nWe therefore deem that issue waived. (Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist. (1995)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2283191\"><a href=\"/opinion/2283191/landry-v-berryessa-union-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699-700.) Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err\nby applying New York law to this dispute.\n\n2.     Paramount Was Not a Fiduciary\n\n       Focusing primarily on California law, Marathon contends that Paramount was its\nfiduciary because the investment agreement effectively created a joint venture that\novercame the contractual disclaimers of fiduciary duty, or because Paramount‟s exclusive\ncontrol over Marathon‟s funds gave rise to such a duty, where Marathon reposed trust\nand confidence in Paramount. As previously noted, however, New York law applies to\nthis dispute, making California law inapplicable. Because the parties agree that there was\nno disputed evidence concerning the proper interpretation of the investment agreement,\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fwe exercise our independent review when construing its provisions.

There are five requirements to the\nformation of a joint venture in New York: (1) two or more persons must enter into a\nspecific agreement to carry on an enterprise for profit; (2) their agreement must evidence\ntheir intent to be joint venturers; (3) each must contribute property, financing, skill,\nknowledge, or effort; (4) each must have some degree of control over the venture; and\n(5) there must be a provision for the sharing of both profits and losses. (Id. at p. 445.)8\nNothing in the investment agreement shows the intent to create a joint venture.

Based on our\nholding that a joint venture was not created because the agreement does not evidence\nsuch an intent and because Marathon had no control over the enterprise, we need not\nreach that issue.\n\n10      The flip side of these decisions is found in N.E.

In that case, New York‟s highest state\ncourt held that although parties are free to contract for the existence of fiduciary duties\namong themselves, unless the relationship between the parties is fiduciary as a matter of\nlaw, the courts should not impose such duties if the parties have not done so themselves.\n(Id. at pp. 131-133.)\n\n                                              12\n\f       At issue in Martin was whether the trial court properly sustained demurrers to a\ncomplaint on the ground that the defendants were not partners of a brokerage firm to\nwhich they had loaned money. In affirming that order, the Martin court noted that the\nloan agreement which was the source of the alleged partnership disclaimed any such\nrelationship. However, disclaimers of that type might be a sham, the court observed, and\nthe true nature of the parties‟ business relationship was to be determined by the terms and\neffect of their agreement. (Martin, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3589528\"><a href=\"/opinion/3607730/martin-v-peyton/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at p. 78.) Even though the loan\nagreement imposed a complex of arrangements giving the defendants substantial control\nover the firm and its principals, the court concluded that no partnership had been formed.\n(Id. at pp. 79-80.)\n       The plaintiff in Rubenstein loaned money to the producer of a vaudeville show,\nwith repayment to come from unused loans, advances, and the excess of gross receipts\nover production costs and operating expenses, if any. Instead of interest, the plaintiff\nwould be paid 10 percent of the net receipts. The defendant was supposed to furnish\nregular detailed financial statements showing costs, expenditures, and receipts. The\nagreement indicated that other parties might loan money to the production on the same\nterms. It also stated that the parties were not partners, joint venturers, or principal and\nagent. When the defendant refused to pay back any of the loan funds or to provide an\naccounting, the plaintiff brought an equitable action for an accounting. The trial court\nsustained the defendant‟s demurrer on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate\nremedy at law.\n       The Rubenstein court reversed. First, in reliance on Martin, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3589528\"><a href=\"/opinion/3607730/martin-v-peyton/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, it\nheld that the disclaimer of a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship was not\ndeterminative, leaving it free to examine the true nature of the parties‟ relationship.\n(Rubenstein, supra, 75 N.Y.S.2d at p. 485.) Next, it held that the agreement did not\ncreate a true debtor-creditor relationship because the possibility that the plaintiff might\nnot be repaid meant he had not made a true loan of money. (Id. at pp. 485-486.) Instead,\na fiduciary relationship respecting the use of plaintiff‟s funds was created, placing on\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fdefendant the duty to account for his use of the funds. Therefore, a cause of action for\nthe equitable remedy of accounting had been pled. (Id. at p. 486.)\n       From Martin, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3589528\"><a href=\"/opinion/3607730/martin-v-peyton/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Rubenstein, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we\nderive the rule that despite any contractual disclaimers to the contrary, fiduciary\nrelationships such as that of partners or joint venturers may be created by the operative\neffect of the parties‟ agreement. As we have already held, however, nothing in the\ninvestment agreement here gave rise to a joint venture under New York law.\n       The investment agreement here spelled out the nature and effect of Marathon‟s\ninvestment in the various covered pictures. Those terms also supplied a formula by\nwhich Marathon might receive a return on its investments, along with Paramount‟s\nexpress duty to provide an accounting. Those same terms also clearly and explicitly\nstated that no fiduciary duties were created by the investment agreement.11 Based on this,\nwe conclude that neither Martin nor Rubenstein is applicable, and that Marathon‟s\nexpress waiver of any fiduciary duties by Paramount was effective.12\n\n\n11      At oral argument, Marathon relied on our recent decision in Cleveland v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1315</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where we held there was substantial evidence to support a\njury‟s verdict that a business promoter owed, and breached, his fiduciary duty to\ninvestors by using their money to fund a successor business after the one in which they\ninvested had failed. We reject Marathon‟s reliance on this decision for several reasons.\nFirst, we are applying New York law, not California law. Second, the agreement did not\ninclude the disclaimers of fiduciary duty found here or in the New York decisions we\nhave cited. Third, the agreement in Cleveland was not between sophisticated entities\nrepresented by counsel, and did not include the disclaimers of fiduciary duty present here\nor in decisions like City of Hope National Medical Center v. Genentech, Inc. (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634389\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634389/city-of-hope-nat-med-center-v-genentech/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387, as we noted in Cleveland. Fourth, in Cleveland, we held that the\nrelationship imposed fiduciary duties as a matter of law because for all intents and\npurposes, the plaintiffs were stockholders, as to whom promoters owe fiduciary duties.\n(Cleveland at pp. 1342-1343.) There is no promoter-stockholder relationship here.\n\n12     Because we affirm the judgment on the ground no fiduciary duty existed, we need\nnot reach Marathon‟s contentions that Paramount in fact breached its fiduciary duties,\nthat Marathon is entitled as a matter of law to judgment in the sum of more than\n$3.6 million, and that we should remand the matter for a new trial as to punitive damages.\n\n\n                                             14\n\f3.     Marathon Was Not Wrongfully Deprived of Its Right to a Jury Trial\n\n       Paramount brought a pretrial motion to have this action decided at a court trial, not\nby a jury, on two grounds: (1) the breach of fiduciary duty claim was equitable in\nnature, meaning no jury trial was warranted; and (2) no jury trial was required because\nthere would be no extrinsic, disputed evidence concerning the interpretation of the\ninvestment agreement, making the matter one for the court, not a jury. The trial court\ngranted the motion on the first ground. Marathon contends the trial court erred.13\n       Rather than parse more than 100 years of jurisprudence concerning the nature of\nactions in equity, law, or chancery, we choose to affirm on the alternative ground for\nParamount‟s bench trial motion: that no jury was required because at issue was the\ninterpretation of a contract based solely on the contract terms and certain undisputed\nbackground facts, which are questions of law for a court to decide. In such a case, there\nis no right to have a jury resolve the dispute. (Garcia v. Truck Insurance Exchange\n(1984) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439; Oceanside 84, Ltd. v.

Furthermore, Marathon did not address this\nissue in either its opening appellate brief, or, after respondent‟s brief did so, in appellant‟s\nreply brief. As a result, we affirm the trial court‟s order on the alternative ground that the\nissue has been waived. (Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist., supra, 39 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 699-700.)\n\n4.

We take each in turn.\n       Marathon relies on Kangarlou v. Progressive Title Co., Inc. (2005)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286488\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286488/kangarlou-v-progressive-title-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, for the proposition that tort claims such as breach of fiduciary\nduty do not enforce a contract and are not considered actions on a contract for purposes\nof the reciprocal attorney‟s fee provision found at Civil Code section 1717.\n       The plaintiff in Kangarlou was a home buyer who sued her real estate agent, real\nestate broker, and escrow company for breach of fiduciary duty in several respects:\nfailing to obtain evidence that a broker was regularly licensed before delivering\ncompensation to him, communicating to her facts learned about the escrow instructions\nor the broker‟s license, exercising reasonable skill and diligence in carrying out the\nescrow instructions, and strictly complying with her written instructions concerning the\ndelivery or money or documents at the close of escrow. The jury found for the plaintiff\nand the trial court awarded her attorney‟s fees under a provision in the escrow agreement\nwhich provided that if the plaintiff failed to pay fees or expenses due under the escrow\ninstructions, she agreed “to pay the attorney‟s fees and costs incurred to collect such fees\nor expenses.”\n       Under Civil Code section 1717, that one-sided fee provision gave the plaintiff the\nreciprocal right to recover fees in actions on, or to enforce, the contract. Although tort\nclaims do not ordinarily “enforce” contract terms, some tort claims may also constitute a\nbreach of contract as well. (Kangarlou, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1178.) Because the\nfiduciary duties which underlay the plaintiff‟s claim arose out her contract, the court held\nthat her tort claim was on the contract for purposes of awarding attorney‟s fees under\nCivil Code section 1717. (Kangarlou, at p. 1179.)\n       As we read Kangarlou, it actually undercuts Marathon‟s contention. Marathon‟s\nfiduciary duty claim against Paramount was based on duties that arose under the contract:\nto account for and pay all sums owed pursuant to the investment agreement‟s provisions.\n\n\n                                             16\n\fRegardless, we are reviewing a far broader provision than the one in Kangarlou. Here,\nthe parties agreed to pay fees to the party who prevailed on actions arising out of their\ncontract. Such broadly worded provisions are construed to encompass tort claims\n(Santisas v. Goodin (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607) and we therefore reject Marathon‟s\ncontention.\n       As for the size of the award, Paramount requested fees of $768,948.40, but the\ntrial court, after reviewing the billing records submitted in support of the fee motion,\ndetermined that some of the time billed was duplicative and excessive. The trial court\ntherefore reduced the award to $690,548.80. The trial court also found that the hourly\nrates being charged – ranging from $192 to $587 for lawyers and $60 to $150 for\nparalegals – was reasonable. Marathon contends the fee award is still too high because it\nrepresents 1,974 hours of lawyers‟ time, an amount that Marathon believes is excessive\nand unreasonable.14\n       We review the trial court‟s order under the abuse of discretion standard, keeping in\nmind that the experienced trial judge is in the best position to determine the value of legal\nservices rendered in his court. (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2290471\"><a href=\"/opinion/2290471/graciano-v-robinson-ford-sales-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148-149.) We make all reasonable presumptions in favor of the\ntrial court‟s order where the record is silent, and Marathon has the burden of\naffirmatively showing error, along with a record adequate to do so. (Ketchum v. Moses\n(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637388/ketchum-v-moses/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1140-1141.) Marathon does not point to a single instance where\nthe billing records show an unreasonable, unnecessary, or duplicative charge. As a result,\nit has failed to carry its burden of affirmatively showing error and, under the applicable\nstandard of review, we defer to the trial court‟s reasoned assessment of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n14    On appeal, Marathon does not challenge the hourly rates claimed by Paramount‟s\nlawyers.\n\n                                             17\n\f                                       DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment and the postjudgment order awarding Paramount its attorney‟s fees\nare affirmed.
