Regardless, it became clear in the summary judgment record\nthat whether Fisher would have been admitted even if she had a perfect PAI score presented\nno genuine issue of fact. She would not have been admitted. The same was true for\nMichalewicz, then a co-plaintiff.\n        18 Plaintiffs “must show that (1) they have suffered an injury in fact, (2) a causal\n\nconnection exists between the injury and challenged conduct, and (3) a favorable decision is\nlikely to redress the injury.” Adar v.

The Supreme\nCourt did not address the issue of standing, although it was squarely presented\nto it. 27 Rather, it remanded the case for a decision on the merits, having\n\n\n\n\n       21   Grupo Dataflux v.

The\nparties have identified no changes in jurisdictional facts occurring since\nbriefing in the Supreme Court. Fisher’s standing is limited to challenging the\ninjury she alleges she suffered—the use of race in UT Austin’s admissions\nprogram for the entering freshman class of Fall 2008.\n                                              II\n       We turn to the question whether we can and should remand this case.\nThe Supreme Court’s mandate frames its resolution, ordering that “[t]he\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.” The mandate must be read against\nthe backdrop of custom that accords courts of appeal discretion to remand to\nthe district court on receipt of remands to it for proceedings consistent with the\nopinion—a customary discretion not displaced but characterized by nigh boiler\nplate variations in phrasing of instructions such as “on remand the Court of\nAppeals may ‘consider,’” or “for the Court of Appeals to consider in the first\ninstance.” 30\n                                              A\n       Fisher argues that the Supreme Court’s remanding language—“fairness\nto the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded\nso that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct\nanalysis” 31—compels the conclusion that “fairness” must be achieved by having\n\n\n\n       28 438 U.S. 265 (1978).\n       29 539 U.S. 306 (2003).\n       30 See, e.g., Spector v.

Fisher relies on the\nSupreme Court’s statement that “the Court of Appeals must assess whether\nthe University has offered sufficient evidence that its admissions program is\nnarrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.” 32 And Fisher\nargues that at summary judgment, all parties conceded that there were no\ngenuine issues of material fact to be resolved and that the case should be\ndecided on summary judgment.\n      UT Austin opposes this parsing of language, arguing that Fisher fails to\ncredit (i) the entirety of the Supreme Court’s references which spoke, not just\nto the fairness of allowing this Court to correct its error, but also to the fairness\nto the district court, which first heard the case and was faulted for the same\nerror as this Court; and, (ii) that the language used by the Supreme Court is\nthe common language of remand orders and is often followed by a remand to\nthe district court.       UT Austin notes that in its remanding language, the\nSupreme Court cites Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 33 where the court of\nappeals remanded to the district court after the Supreme Court vacated the\njudgment of the court of appeals for failure to apply strict scrutiny. Finally,\nUT Austin argues that the remand language, at best, is ambiguous and, given\nthe custom of the courts of appeals, should not be read to foreclose the clear\ndiscretion of this Court to remand absent specific, contrary instructions from\nthe Supreme Court.\n      Given the customary practice of the courts of appeals and the less than\nclear language of the Supreme Court’s remand, we are not persuaded that the\nSupreme Court intended to foreclose our discretion to remand to the district\ncourt.

Yet, this is telling. Had the Supreme Court intended to control the\ndiscretion of this Court as to whether the district court should first address an\nerror that the Supreme Court found was made by both courts, there would have\nbeen no uncertainty in the remand language. The question whether we should\nremand remains.\n                                              B\n      There is no clear benefit to remanding this case to the district court. The\nsuggestion, without more, that discovery may be necessary given the Supreme\nCourt’s holding regarding proper scrutiny and deference adds nothing.\nAdmittedly, this case differs from Grutter, in that Grutter went to trial. And\nevidence offered by live witnesses is far more likely to surface and resolve fact\nissues than summary judgment evidence crafted by advocates. But that too is\nfar from certain. Indeed, UT Austin’s argument goes no further than “factual\nquestions or disputes may arise on remand.” 34 Notably, UT Austin does not\nargue that a trial will be necessary. Rather its principal target on remand is\nstanding, with questions that continue to haunt, but are foreclosed by the\nSupreme Court’s implicit finding of standing, questions only it can now\naddress.\n      We find that there are no new issues of fact that need be resolved, nor is\nthere any identified need for additional discovery; that the record is sufficiently\ndeveloped; and that the found error is common to both this Court and the\ndistrict court. It follows that a remand would likely result in duplication of\neffort. We deny UT Austin’s motion for remand, and turn to the merits.\n\n\n\n\n      34   Defs.’ Mot. to Remand at 4.\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085       Page: 10     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n                                           III\n                                            A\n      In remanding, the Supreme Court held that its decision in Grutter\nrequires that “strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program using\nracial categories or classifications”; 35 that “racial classifications are\nconstitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling\ngovernmental interests.” 36      Bringing forward Justice Kennedy’s dissent in\nGrutter, the Supreme Court faulted the district court’s and this Court’s review\nof UT Austin’s means to achieve the permissible goal of diversity—whether UT\nAustin’s efforts were narrowly tailored to achieve the end of a diverse student\nbody. Our charge is to give exacting scrutiny to these efforts.\n      The Supreme Court has made clear that “a university’s educational\njudgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to\nwhich we defer.” 37 The “decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow\nfrom student body diversity that the University deems integral to its mission\nis, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not\ncomplete, judicial deference is proper under Grutter.” 38 Accordingly, a court\n“should ensure that there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the\nacademic decision.” 39\n      In both Fisher and Grutter, the Supreme Court endorsed Justice Powell’s\nconclusion that “attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a constitutionally\npermissible goal for an institution of higher education;” 40 that in contrast to\n\n\n\n      35 Fisher, 133 S.

Thus, Fisher\nargues, the race-conscious admissions policy had a de minimis effect, at most\nadding 0.92% African-American enrollment and 2.5% Hispanic enrollment;\nthat a slight contribution is not a “constitutionally meaningful” impact on\nstudent body diversity and is no more than an exercise in gratuitous racial\nengineering.\n      This effort to truncate the inquiry clings to a baseline that crops events\nFisher’s claim ignores, as it must.              The true narrative presents with a\ncompleteness both fair and compelled by the Supreme Court’s charge to\nascertain the facts in full without deference, exposing the de minimis argument\nas an effort to turn narrow tailoring upside down. We turn to that narrative.\n                                               B\n      In 1997, following the Hopwood v. Texas 65 decision, UT Austin faced a\nnearly intractable problem: achieving diversity—including racial diversity—\nessential to its educational mission, while not facially considering race even as\none of many components of that diversity. Forbidden any use of race after\nHopwood, UT Austin turned to the Top Ten Percent Plan, which guarantees\nTexas residents graduating in the top ten percent of their high school class\nadmission to any public university in Texas. Such a mechanical admissions\nprogram could have filled every freshman seat but standing alone it was not a\nworkable means of achieving the diversity envisioned by Bakke, bypassing as\nit did high-performing multi-talented students, minority and non-minority.\n\n\n      65   78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), abrogated by Grutter, 539 U.S. at 322.\n                                              15\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085        Page: 16     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\nWith its blindness to all but the single dimension of class rank, the Top Ten\nPercent Plan came with significant costs to diversity and academic integrity,\npassing over large numbers of highly qualified minority and non-minority\napplicants. The difficulties of Texas’s and other states’ percentage plans did\nnot escape the Court in Grutter, which explained that “even assuming such\nplans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the\nindividualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not\njust racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the\nuniversity.” 66\n      Nor did these difficulties escape the Texas legislature. Opponents to the\nproposed plan noted that such a policy “could actually harm institutions” and\n“would not solve the problems created by [Hopwood].” 67 So the legislature\nadopted a Top Ten Percent Plan that left a substantial number of seats to a\ncomplementary holistic review process. Foreshadowing Grutter, admission\nsupplementing the Top Ten Percent Plan included factors such as socio-\neconomic diversity and family educational achievements but, controlled by\nHopwood, it did not include race.           In short, a holistic process sans race\ncontrolled the gate for the large percent of applicants not entering through the\nTop Ten Percent Plan. Over the succeeding years the Top Ten Percent Plan\ntook an increasing number of seats, a take inherent in its structure and a\ncenterpiece of narrow tailoring, as we will explain.\n                                                C\n      We are offered no coherent response to the validity of a potentially\ndifferent election by UT Austin: to invert the process and use Grutter’s holistic\nreview to select 80% or all of its students.

Grutter blessed an\nadmissions program, applied to the entire pool of students competing for\nadmission, which “considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to\nassemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.” Affording\nno deference, we look for narrow tailoring in UT’s Austin’s use of this\nindividualized race-conscious holistic review, applied as it is only to a small\nfraction of the student body as the rest is consumed by race-neutral efforts.\n      Close scrutiny of the data in this record confirms that holistic review—\nwhat little remains after over 80% of the class is admitted on class rank alone—\ndoes not, as claimed, function as an open gate to boost minority headcount for\na racial quota.       Far from it.      The increasingly fierce competition for the\ndecreasing number of seats available for Texas students outside the top ten\npercent results in minority students being under-represented—and white\nstudents being over-represented—in holistic review admissions relative to the\nprogram’s impact on each incoming class. In other words, for each year since\nthe Top Ten Percent Plan was created through 2008, holistic review\ncontributed a greater percentage of the incoming class of Texans as a whole\nthan it did the incoming minority students. Examples illustrate this effect. Of\nthe incoming class of 2008, the year Fisher applied for admission, holistic\nreview contributed 19% of the class of Texas students as a whole—but only\n12% of the Hispanic students and 16% of the black students, while contributing\n24% of the white students. 68 The incoming class of 2005, the year that the\nGrutter plan was first introduced, is similar. That year, 31% of the class of\nTexas students as a whole was admitted through holistic review (with the\nremaining 69% of incoming seats for Texans filled by the Top Ten Percent\nPlan)—but only 21% of the Hispanic Texan students in the incoming class were\n\n\n      68   2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 7 tbl.1a.\n                                              17\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 18     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\nadmitted through holistic review, and 26% of the incoming black Texan\nstudents, but 35% of the incoming white Texan students. 69 Minorities being\nunder-represented in holistic review admission relative to the impact of holistic\nreview on the class as a whole holds true almost without exception for both\nblacks and Hispanics for every year from 1996–2008, 70 and can be seen in the\nchart attached to this opinion at Appendix 1.\n       Given the test score gaps between minority and non-minority applicants,\nif holistic review was not designed to evaluate each individual’s contributions\nto UT Austin’s diversity, including those that stem from race, holistic\nadmissions would approach an all-white enterprise.

The de facto\nsegregation of schools in Texas 98 enables the Top Ten Percent Plan to increase\n\n\n\n       96  Id. Data for the preceding years showed a similar test score gap. For the entering\nTexas class of 2007, Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test score of 1225\nversus the average standardized test score of 1246 attained by non-Top Ten Percent Texas\nstudents. Similarly, in 2006, Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test\nscore of 1220 versus an average standardized test score of 1257 for non-Top Ten Percent\nstudents. For 2005, Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test score of 1226\nversus an average standardized test score of 1277 for non-Top Ten Percent students.

Id.\n        97 Id. at 9, 13–15. For minority students, difference in average standardized test\n\nscores between admitted Texas Top Ten Percent students and non-Top Ten Percent students\nfluctuated in size but remained significant in the pre- and post-Grutter years leading up to\nFisher’s application. Among Hispanic students, the gap was 1100 versus 1189 in 2003; 1110\nversus 1189 in 2004; 1122 versus 1193 in 2005; 1105 versus 1154 in 2006; and 1115 versus\n1155 in 2007. For African-American students, the gap was 1063 versus 1065 in 2003; 1046\nversus 1116 in 2004; 1059 versus 1118 in 2005; 1067 versus 1086 in 2006; and 1078 versus\n1073 in 2007. See id. at 14–15. And a comparison of raw SAT scores does not\ntell the full story, as SAT scores are scaled. See, e.g., CollegeBoard SAT, 2006\nCollege-Bound       Seniors:   Total   Group    Profile    Report     (2006),     available  at\nhttp://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/cb-seniors-2006-national-\nreport.pdf. Looking at the percentile point gives a better picture. For SAT test-takers in\n2006, the 50th percentile combined score was 1020, while a 75th percentile score was 1180,\na mere 160 points higher. Id. at 2. Thus, a score differential of 80 points, for example, which\nrepresents the approximate differential between holistic review and Top Ten Percent\nHispanic admittees, represents students scoring at approximately a 12–13 higher percentile.\n        98 For example, only 8.1% of all students in Houston ISD are white. See Houston\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 2011–2012 Facts and Figures 1 (2012). Similarly, only 4.6% of students in\nthe Dallas Independent School District are white. See Dallas Indep. Sch.

Texas is here an active\nlab of experimentation embraced by the Court in Schuette v. BAMN. 100 We\nreference here these unchallenged facts of resegregation not in justification of\na racial remedy, but because the racial makeup and relative performance of\nTexas high schools bear on the workability of an alternative to any use of race\nfor 80% of student admissions to UT Austin. The political branches opted for\nthis facially race-neutral alternative—a narrow tailoring in implementation of\ntheir goal of diversity.\n       Fisher’s claim can proceed only if Texas must accept this weakness of the\nTop Ten Percent Plan and live with its inability to look beyond class rank and\nfocus upon individuals. Perversely, to do so would put in place a quota system\npretextually race neutral. While the Top Ten Percent Plan boosts minority\nenrollment by skimming from the tops of Texas high schools, it does so against\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Indep. Sch. Dist., Facts and Figures (2012). This de facto school segregation stems\nfrom residential patterns and means that students in the top ten percent of a highly\nsegregated school likely grew up in the same residential zone. The top 29 graduates from\nJack Yates High School in Houston live in the same predominately African-American\nneighborhood of that city’s Third Ward, and thus likely experienced a similar cultural\nenvironment.

That other students are left out—those\nwho fell outside their high school’s top ten percent but excelled in unique ways\nthat would enrich the diversity of UT Austin’s educational experience—leaves\na gap in an admissions process seeking to create the multi-dimensional\ndiversity that Bakke envisions.\n                                          C\n      UT     Austin’s     holistic    review    program—a        program      nearly\nindistinguishable from the University of Michigan Law School’s program in\nGrutter—was a necessary and enabling component of the Top Ten Percent Plan\nby allowing UT Austin to reach a pool of minority and non-minority students\nwith records of personal achievement, higher average test scores, or other\nunique skills. A variety of perspectives, that is differences in life experiences,\nis a distinct and valued element of diversity. Yet a significant number of\nstudents excelling in high-performing schools are passed over by the Top Ten\nPercent Plan although they could bring a perspective not captured by\nadmissions along the sole dimension of class rank. For example, the experience\nof being a minority in a majority-white or majority-minority school and\nsucceeding in that environment offers a rich pool of potential UT Austin\nstudents with demonstrated qualities of leadership and sense of self. Efforts\nto draw from this pool do not demean the potential of Top Ten admittees.\nRather it complements their contribution to diversity—mitigating in an\nimportant way the effects of the single dimension process.\n      UT Austin persuades that this reach into the applicant pool is not a\nfurther search for numbers but a search for students of unique talents and\nbackgrounds who can enrich the diversity of the student body in distinct ways\nincluding test scores, predicting higher levels of preparation and better\nprospects for admission to UT Austin’s more demanding colleges and\nultimately graduation. It also signifies that this is a draw from a highly\n                                         29\n\f   Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085     Page: 30   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 09-50822\ncompetitive pool, a mix of minority and non-minority students who would\notherwise be absent from a Top Ten Percent pool selected on class rank, a\nrelative and not an independent measure across the pool of applicants.\n                                       VI\n      These realities highlight the difficulty of an approach that seeks to couch\nthe concept of critical mass within numerical terms. The numbers support UT\nAustin’s argument that its holistic use of race in pursuit of diversity is not\nabout quotas or targets, but about its focus upon individuals, an opportunity\ndenied by the Top Ten Percent Plan. Achieving the critical mass requisite to\ndiversity goes astray when it drifts to numerical metrics.     UT Austin urges\nthat it has made clear that looking to numbers, while relevant, has not been\nits measure of success; and that its goals are not captured by population ratios.\nWe find this contention proved, mindful that by 2011, Texas high school\ngraduates were majority-minority.\n      UT Austin urges that its first step in narrow tailoring was the admission\nof over 80% of its Texas students though a facially race-neutral process, and\nthat Fisher’s embrace of the sweep of the Top Ten Percent Plan as a full\nachievement of diversity reduces critical mass to a numerical game and little\nmore than a cover for quotas. Fisher refuses to acknowledge this distinction\nbetween critical mass—the tipping point of diversity—and a quota. And in\nseeking to quantify “critical mass” as a rigid numerical goal, Fisher misses the\nmark. Fisher is correct that if UT Austin defined its goal of diversity by the\nnumbers only, the Top Ten Percent Plan could be calibrated to meet that mark.\nTo do so, however, would deny the role of holistic review as a necessary\ncomplement to Top Ten Percent admissions. We are persuaded that holistic\nreview is a necessary complement to the Top Ten Percent Plan, enabling it to\noperate without reducing itself to a cover for a quota system; that in doing so,\n\n\n                                       30\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085         Page: 31    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\nits limited use of race is narrowly tailored to this role—as small a part as\npossible for the Plan to succeed.\n                                            A\n      The Top Ten Percent Plan is dynamic, its take floating year to year with\nthe number of Texas high school graduates in the top ten percent of their class\nthat choose to capitalize on their automatic admission to the flagship\nuniversity. Its impact on the composition of each incoming class predictably\nhas grown dramatically, leaving ever fewer holistic review seats available for\nthe growing demographic of Texas high school graduates. In 1996, when the\nTop Ten Percent Plan was introduced, it admitted 42% of the Texas incoming\nclass; by 2005, when the Grutter plan was introduced, the Plan occupied 69%\nof the seats available to Texas residents; by 2008, when Fisher applied for\nadmission, it had swelled to 81%. 121 The increasing take of the Top Ten\nPercent Plan both enhanced its strengths and exacerbated its inherent\nweaknesses in composing the UT student body, as the overwhelming majority\nof seats was granted to students without the facial use of race but also without\nconsideration of experiences beyond a single academic dimension. So as the\ntake of the Top Ten Percent Plan grew, so also did the necessity of a\ncomplementary holistic admissions program to achieve the diversity\nenvisioned by Bakke.\n       A quick glance in the public record of data since 2008 confirms that UT\nAustin’s race-conscious holistic review program has a self-limiting nature, one\nthat complements UT Austin’s periodic review of the program’s necessity to\nensure it is limited in time. For the entering class of 2009, the year after Fisher\n\n\n      121 In 1996, the Top Ten Percent Plan admitted 41.8% of the incoming class of Texas\nstudents; 36.6% in 1997; 41.1% in 1998; 44.9% in 1999; 47.4% in 2000; 51.3% in 2001; 54.4%\nin 2002; 70.4% in 2003; 66.3% in 2004; 68.7% in 2005; 71.4% in 2006; 70.6% in 2007; and\n80.9% in 2008. See 2006 Top Ten Percent Report at 5 tbl.1a (data for years 1996–2005); 2008\nTop Ten Percent Report at 7 tbl.1a (data for 2006–2008).\n                                            31\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 32     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\napplied for admission, the Top Ten Percent Plan’s take of the seats available\nfor Texas residents swelled to 86% and remained at 85% in 2010. 122\n       This trend did not escape the Texas Legislature. Consistent with its\nlong-standing view of holistic review as a crucial complement to the Top Ten\nPercent Plan, Texas passed Senate Bill 175 of the 81st Texas Legislature (SB\n175) in 2009. SB 175 modified the Top Ten Percent Plan for UT Austin to\nauthorize the University “to limit automatic admission to no less than 75% of\nits enrollment capacity for first-time resident undergraduate students\nbeginning with admission for the entering class of 2011 and ending with the\nentering class of 2015.” 123 Pursuant to SB 175, UT Austin restricted automatic\nadmissions to the top 7% for Fall 2014 and Fall 2015 applicants, to the top 8%\nfor Fall 2011 and Fall 2013 applicants, and to the top 9% for Fall 2012\napplicants. 124    All remaining slots continue to be filled through holistic\nreview. 125 For the entering class of 2011, the first affected by SB 175, 74% of\nenrolled Texas residents were automatically admitted (with a higher\npercentage of offers of admission), a figure that again was pushed upward by\ninherent population forces, to 77% for the entering Texas class of 2013. 126\n       In the growing shadow of the Top Ten Percent Plan, there was a cautious,\ncreeping numerical increase in minority representation following the inclusion\nof race and ethnicity in the holistic review program, a testament, UT Austin\nsays, to its race-conscious holistic review. We must agree.

The trend has\ncontinued since, climbing to 5.13% in 2006, 5.41% in 2007, and 5.67% in 2008.\nSimilarly, the percentage of Hispanic admitted students climbed from 16.21%\nin 2004, to 17.88% in 2005, 18.08% in 2006, 19.07% in 2007, and 20.41% in\n2008. 127 The modest numbers only validate the targeted role of UT Austin’s\nuse of Grutter. Nor can they be viewed as a pretext for quota seeking—an\nassertion of Fisher’s belied by the reality that over this time frame graduating\nTexas high school seniors approached being majority-minority. The small\nincreases do not exceed critical mass nor imply a quota but instead bring a\ndistinct dimension of diversity to the Top Ten Percent Plan. To be sure, critical\nmass can be used as a cover for quotas and proportionality goals, but it is not\ninevitable; UT Austin persuades that viewed objectively, under its structure,\nits efforts in holistic review have not been simply to expand the numbers but\nrather the diversity of individual contributions.\n      Turning in the opposite direction from her claim of racial quotas, Fisher\nfaults UT Austin’s holistic use of race for its de minimis contribution to\ndiversity. UT Austin replies that this turns narrow tailoring upside down. We\nagree. Holistic review allows selection of an overwhelming number of students\nby facially neutral measures and for the remainder race is only a factor of\nfactors. Fisher’s focus on the numbers of minorities admitted through the\nholistic gate relative to those admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan is\nflawed, ignoring its role as a necessary complement to the Plan. The apt\nquestion is its contribution to the richness of diversity as envisioned by Bakke\nagainst the backdrop of the Top Ten Percent Plan. That is its palliative role\n\n\n      127   2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6 tbl.1.\n                                              33\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085     Page: 34   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 09-50822\nclaimed by UT Austin. So viewed, holistic review’s low production of numbers\nis its strength, not its weakness.\n      In sum, Fisher points to the numbers and nothing more in arguing that\nrace-conscious admissions were no longer necessary because a “critical mass”\nof minority students had been achieved by the time Fisher applied for\nadmission—a head count by skin color or surname that is not the diversity\nenvisioned by Bakke and a measure it rejected. In 2007, Fisher emphasizes,\nthere were 5.8% African-American and 19.7% Hispanic enrolled students,\nwhich exceeds pre-Hopwood levels and the minority enrollment at the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School examined in Grutter. But an examination\nthat looks exclusively at the percentage of minority students fails before it\nbegins. Indeed, as Grutter teaches, an emphasis on numbers in a mechanical\nadmissions process is the most pernicious of discriminatory acts because it\nlooks to race alone, treating minority students as fungible commodities that\nrepresent a single minority viewpoint. Critical mass, the tipping point of\ndiversity, has no fixed upper bound of universal application, nor is it the\nminimum threshold at which minority students do not feel isolated or like\nspokespersons for their race. Grutter defines critical mass by reference to a\nbroader view of diversity rather than by the achievement of a certain quota of\nminority students. Here, UT Austin has demonstrated a permissible goal of\nachieving the educational benefits of diversity within that university’s distinct\nmission, not seeking a percentage of minority students that reaches some\narbitrary size.\n      Implicitly conceding the need for holistic review, Fisher offers\nsocioeconomic disadvantage as a race-neutral alternative in holistic review.\nUT Austin points to widely accepted scholarly work concluding that “there are\nalmost six times as many white students as black students who both come from\n[socio-economically disadvantaged] families and have test scores that are\n                                       34\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085       Page: 35    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\nabove the threshold for gaining admission at an academically selective college\nor university.” 128   At bottom, the argument is that minority students are\ndisadvantaged by class, not race; the socioeconomic inquiry is a neutral proxy\nfor race. Bakke accepts that skin color matters—it disadvantages and ought\nnot be relevant but it is. We are ill-equipped to sort out race, class, and\nsocioeconomic structures, and Bakke did not undertake to do so. To the point,\nwe are ill-equipped to disentangle them and conclude that skin color is no\nlonger an index of prejudice; that we would will it does not make it so.\n      We are satisfied that UT Austin has demonstrated that race-conscious\nholistic review is necessary to make the Top Ten Percent Plan workable by\npatching the holes that a mechanical admissions program leaves in its ability\nto achieve the rich diversity that contributes to its academic mission—as\ndescribed by Bakke and Grutter.\n                                           B\n      Over the history of holistic review, its intake of students has declined,\nminority and non-minority, and changed the profile of the students it admits—\nthe growing number of applicants and increasing take of the Top Ten Percent\nPlan raises the competitive bar each year, before race is ever considered, for\nthe decreasing number of seats filled by holistic review. Those admitted are\nthose that otherwise would be missed in the diversity mix— for example, those\nwith special talents beyond class rank and identifiable at the admission gate,\nand minorities with the experience of attending an integrated school with\nbetter educational resources.\n      The data also show that white students are awarded the overwhelming\nmajority of the highly competitive holistic review seats. As we have explained\n\n\n\n      128 Supp. Br. of Appellee at 30 (citing William G. Bowen & Derek Bok, The Shape of\nthe River 51 (1998)).\n                                          35\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085        Page: 36     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\nand as shown in Appendix 2, the increasing take of the Top Ten Percent Plan\nis inherently self-limiting. UT Austin has demonstrated that it is on a path\nthat each year reduces the role of race.           After the Top Ten Percent Plan\nswallowed 81% of the seats available for Texas students in 2008, for example,\nwhite Texan students admitted through holistic review occupied an additional\n12% of the overall seats. Only 2.4% and 0.9% of the incoming class of Texas\nhigh school graduates were Hispanic and black students admitted through\nholistic review.      That is, admission via the holistic review program—\noverwhelmingly and disproportionally of white students—is highly competitive\nfor minorities and non-minorities alike. These data persuade us of the force of\nUT Austin’s argument that a limited use of race is necessary to target\nminorities with unique talents and higher test scores to add the diversity\nenvisioned by Bakke to the student body.\n      Numbers are not controlling but they are relevant to UT Austin’s\nclaimed need for holistic review as a necessary component of its admission\nprogram.     In 2005, the first class that included race and ethnicity in holistic\nreview, 176 (29%) of 617 total African-American admitted students were\nadmitted via holistic review. 129 Following years were similar, with 32% of\nadmitted African-Americans in 2006, 35% in 2007, and 20% in 2008. 130\nLikewise, significant percentages of Hispanic admitted students were\nadmitted through the holistic review program, making up 24% of the admitted\nHispanic pool in 2005, 26% in 2006, 25% in 2007, and 15% in 2008. 131 These\nnumbers directly support UT Austin’s contention that holistic use of race plays\na necessary role in enabling it to achieve diversity while admitting upwards of\n\n\n\n      129 See 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 8 tbl.2 (providing the percentage of students\nadmitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan by racial and ethnic background).\n      130 Id.\n      131 Id.\n\n                                           36\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085      Page: 37    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n80% of its Texas students by facially neutral standards, drawing as it does from\na pool not measured solely by class rank in largely segregated schools.\n                                        C\n      Recall the 3.5 AI threshold that excluded Fisher. Holistic review for the\ncolleges to which Fisher applied only admitted applicants—minority or non-\nminority—with a minimum AI score of 3.5. This effectively added to the mix a\npool of applicants from which those colleges could admit students with higher\ntest scores and a higher predicted level of performance, despite being outside\nthe top ten percent of their class, as part of a greater mosaic of talents. Insofar\nas some dispersion of minority students among many classes and programs is\nimportant to realizing the educational benefits of diversity, race-conscious\nholistic review is a necessary complement to the Top Ten Percent Plan by\ngiving high-scoring minority students a better chance of gaining admission to\nUT Austin’s competitive academic departments. Fisher’s proffered solution is\nfor UT Austin’s more competitive academic programs to lower their gates. But\nthis misperceives the source of the AI threshold for admission into the\ncompetitive colleges: These programs fill 75% of their seats from the pool of\nstudents automatically admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan. The large\nnumber of holistic review candidates competing for the quarter of the\nremaining seats dictates the high AI threshold that all applicants—minority\nor non-minority—must meet to qualify for admission. Fisher also points to\nweak dispersal across classes as evidence of UT Austin’s pursuit of numbers.\nIt is precisely the opposite. We repeat, holistic review’s search is for diversity,\nas envisioned by Bakke, one benefit of which is its attendant mitigation of the\nclustering tendencies of the Top Ten Percent Plan.\n      Fisher responds that, even if necessary, UT Austin could never narrowly\ntailor a program that achieves classroom diversity.         In particular, Fisher\nsuggests that it is impossible to obtain classroom-level diversity without some\n                                        37\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085        Page: 38    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\nsort of fixed curriculum or lower school- or major-level standards.                This\nargument again misses the mark by defining diversity only by numbers. UT\nAustin does not suggest that the end point of this exercise is a specific measure\nof diversity in every class or every major. Instead, such measures are relevant\nbut not determinative signals of a want of the array of skills needed for\ndiversity. In other words, diversity in the student body surely produces a\ndegree of intra-classroom and intra-major diversity, with the “important and\nlaudable” benefit recognized in Grutter of “classroom discussion [being] livelier,\nmore spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting when the\nstudents have the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.” 132 When the\nholistic review program was modified to be race-conscious, 90% of classes had\none or zero African-American students, 46% had one or zero Asian-American\nstudents, and 43% had one or zero Hispanic students. 133 This represented a\ndecreasing degree of minority classroom dispersion since the adoption of the\nTop Ten Percent Plan.         This does not mean that there will be some set\npercentage of African-American nuclear physics majors. But this does mean\nthat UT Austin’s effort to ensure that African-American students with a broad\narray of skills are in the mix is both permissible and necessary.\n                                          VII\n      Interlacing the Top Ten Percent Plan, with its dependence upon\nsegregated schools to produce minority enrollment, with a plan that did not\nconsider race until it had a universe of applicants clearing a high hurdle of\ndemonstrated scholastic performance strongly supports UT Austin’s assertion\nthat its packaging of the two was necessary in its pursuit of diversity.

And when race enters it is deployed in the\nholistic manner of Grutter as a factor of a factor. Even then the minority\nstudent that receives some boost for her race will have survived a fierce\ncompetition. These minorities are in a real sense, along with the non-minorities\nof this universe, overlooked in a facially neutral Top Ten Percent Plan that\nconsiders only class rank. While outside the Top Ten Percent Plan’s reach, they\nrepresent both high scholastic potential and high achievement in majority-\nwhite schools. We are persuaded that their absence would directly blunt\nefforts for a student body with a rich diversity of talents and experiences.\n      “Context matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under\nthe Equal Protection Clause,” 134 and UT Austin’s admissions program is a\nunique creature.          “[S]trict scrutiny must take relevant differences into\naccount”—[i]ndeed, as [the Court has] explained, that is its fundamental\npurpose.” 135 The precise context of UT Austin’s admissions demonstrates that\nFisher’s charge is belied by this record. Her argument refuses to accept the\nadmission of over 80% of its Texas students without facial consideration of race\nas any part of narrow tailoring, and critically refuses to accept that the process\nadopted for the remaining 20% is essential. It rests on the untenable premise\nthat a Grutter plan for 100% of the admissions is to be preferred. UT Austin’s\nefforts to achieve diversity without facial consideration of race, its narrow\ntailoring of its admission process, in one of the country’s largest states, offers\nno template for others.\n\n\n\n\n      134   Grutter, 539 U.S. at 327 (citing Gomillion v.

This\ncontention views minorities as a group, abjuring the focus upon individuals—\neach person’s unique potential. Race is relevant to minority and non-minority,\nnotably when candidates have flourished as a minority in their school—\nwhether they are white or black. Grutter reaffirmed that “[j]ust as growing up\nin a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to\naffect an individual’s views, so too is one’s own, unique experience of being a\nracial minority in a society, like our own, in which race still matters.” We are\npersuaded that to deny UT Austin its limited use of race in its search for\nholistic diversity would hobble the richness of the educational experience in\ncontradiction of the plain teachings of Bakke and Grutter. The need for such\nskill sets to complement the draws from majority-white and majority-minority\nschools flows directly from an understanding of what the Court has made plain\ndiversity is not. To conclude otherwise is to narrow its focus to a tally of skin\ncolors produced in defiance of Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court which\neschewed the narrow metric of numbers and turned the focus upon individuals.\nThis powerful charge does not deny the relevance of race. We find force in the\nargument that race here is a necessary part, albeit one of many parts, of the\ndecisional matrix where being white in a minority-majority school can set one\napart just as being a minority in a majority-white school—not a proffer of\nsocietal discrimination in justification for use of race, but a search for students\nwith a range of skills, experiences, and performances—one that will be\nimpaired by turning a blind eye to the differing opportunities offered by the\nschools from whence they came.\n                                        40\n\f   Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085      Page: 41   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n      It is settled that instruments of state may pursue facially neutral policies\ncalculated to promote equality of opportunity among students to whom the\npublic schools of Texas assign quite different starting places in the annual race\nfor seats in its flagship university. It is equally settled that universities may\nuse race as part of a holistic admissions program where it cannot otherwise\nachieve diversity. This interest is compelled by the reality that university\neducation is more the shaping of lives than the filling of heads with facts—the\nclassic assertion of the humanities.     Yet the backdrop of our efforts here\nincludes the reality that accepting as permissible policies whose purpose is to\nachieve a desired racial effect taxes the line between quotas and holistic use of\nrace towards a critical mass. We have hewed this line here, persuaded by UT\nAustin from this record of its necessary use of race in a holistic process and the\nwant of workable alternatives that would not require even greater use of race,\nfaithful to the content given to it by the Supreme Court. To reject the UT\nAustin plan is to confound developing principles of neutral affirmative action,\nlooking away from Bakke and Grutter, leaving them in uniform but without\ncommand—due only a courtesy salute in passing.\n      For these reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                       41\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085         Page: 42    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n                                     Appendix 1 136\n\n\n\n\n      136 Data for 1996–2005 comes from the 2006 Top Ten Percent Report at 15–24 tbl.7a–\n7j.

GARZA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n      In vacating our previous opinion, Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 631\nF.3d 213 (5th Cir. 2011), the Supreme Court clarified the strict scrutiny\nstandard as it applies to cases involving racial classifications in higher\neducation admissions: Now, reviewing courts cannot defer to a state actor’s\nargument that its consideration of race is narrowly tailored to achieve its\ndiversity goals. Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2420 (2013).\nAlthough the University has articulated its diversity goal as a “critical mass,”\nsurprisingly, it has failed to define this term in any objective manner.\nAccordingly, it is impossible to determine whether the University’s use of racial\nclassifications in its admissions process is narrowly tailored to its stated goal—\nessentially, its ends remain unknown.\n      By holding that the University’s use of racial classifications is narrowly\ntailored, the majority continues to defer impermissibly to the University’s\nclaims. This deference is squarely at odds with the central lesson of Fisher. A\nproper strict scrutiny analysis, affording the University “no deference” on its\nnarrow tailoring claims, compels the conclusion that the University’s race-\nconscious admissions process does not survive strict scrutiny.\n                                        I\n      As a preliminary matter, Fisher has standing to pursue this appeal, but\nnot because, as the majority contends, the Supreme Court’s opinion does “not\nallow our reconsideration [of the issue of standing].” Ante, at 6.\n      Federal courts have an affirmative duty to verify jurisdiction before\nproceeding to the merits. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83,\n94–95 (1998). Although standing was actively contested before the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085       Page: 45    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nCourt, and although the Court’s opinion is silent about the issue, 1 the Supreme\nCourt has specifically warned against inferring jurisdictional holdings from its\nopinions not explicitly addressing that subject. See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 91.\nAccordingly, the issue of standing remains open, and this court is obliged to\naddress it. Id. at 94–95.\n      In our previous opinion, we held that Fisher had standing to “challenge\n[her] rejection and to seek money damages for [her] injury.” Fisher, 631 F.3d\nat 217. Only one relevant fact has changed since then—in 2012, Fisher\ngraduated from Louisiana State University. The University contends that by\ngraduating, “her forward-looking request for relief became moot” because she\ncould no longer seek reconsideration of her undergraduate application. Fisher’s\ngraduation does not alter our previous standing analysis because, as she\ncorrectly observes, that determination did not depend on a claim for forward-\nlooking injunctive relief. Id. We held that Fisher had standing to seek nominal\nmonetary damages, and we should reach the same conclusion now.\n      The University relies on Texas v. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18 (1999) (per curiam),\nfor the proposition that Fisher lacks standing because she would not have been\nadmitted regardless of her race. But even if Lesage is a standing case (which is\na debatable premise—the case seems to address statutory liability under §\n1983), it does not affect the outcome here. Lesage stands for the proposition\nthat a plaintiff challenging governmental use of racial classifications cannot\nprevail if “it is undisputed that the government would have made the same\ndecision regardless” of such use. Id. at 21 (emphasis added). The University\nasserts that Fisher would not have been admitted even if she had a “perfect”\nPAI score. The majority agrees. Ante, at 5 (“If [Fisher] had been a minority the\nresult would have been the same.”). While Fisher would have been denied\n\n\n      1 As is Justice Scalia’s concurrence, Fisher, 133 S.

Rather, as Fisher explains, the proper question\nis whether she would have fallen above the admissions cut-off line if that line\nhad been drawn on a race-neutral distribution of all applicants’ scores. This\nrecord does not indicate whether Fisher would have been admitted if race were\nremoved from the admissions process altogether. At the least, this is a complex\nquestion that is far from “undisputed.” See Lesage, 528 U.S. at 21. Even the\nUniversity acknowledges that the answer to this question is practically\nunknowable: It concedes that re-engineering the 2008 admissions process by\nretroactively removing consideration of race is virtually impossible since race\nhas an immeasurable, yet potentially material, impact on the placement of the\nfinal admissions cut-off lines for all programs. In sum, the record does not show\nthat   Fisher’s    rejection   under    a   race-neutral     admissions      process    is\n“undisputed,” and remanding to the district court could not alter the record in\nthis regard.\n       The University further challenges Fisher’s standing on redressability\ngrounds. The University’s theory is that even if Fisher had been admitted\nthrough the race-conscious admissions program, and had not suffered the\ninjury of rejection, she still would have paid the non-refundable application fee.\nThus, says the University, because the application fee has no causal link to her\ninjury, any judicial relief would fail to provide redress. This argument\nmisconstrues the nature of Fisher’s alleged injury—it is not her rejection, but\nthe denial of equal protection of the laws during the admissions decision\nprocess. Fisher correctly explains that the application fee represents nominal\ndamages for the alleged constitutional harm stemming from the University’s\nimproper use of racial classifications. 2 Because this harm would have befallen\n\n\n       See Memphis Cmty.

Because Fisher effected a\nchange in the law of strict scrutiny, and corrected our understanding of that\ntest as applied in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), I first review the\ncurrent principles governing this “searching examination.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct.\nat 2420.\n       The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.” U.S. CONST. amend. XIV. It is canonical that the\nConstitution treats distinctions between citizens based on their race or ethnic\norigin as suspect, see, e.g., Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954), and that\nthe Equal Protection Clause “demands that racial classifications . . . be\nsubjected to the most rigid scrutiny,” Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967).\nThus, strict scrutiny begins from the fundamental proposition that “any official\naction that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is\ninherently suspect.” Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 488, 523 (1980) (Stewart,\nJ., dissenting). This is “because racial characteristics so seldom provide a\nrelevant basis for disparate treatment.” Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n469, 505 (1989). “Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry\n\n\nappropriate means of ‘vindicating’ rights whose deprivation has not caused actual, provable\ninjury.”); Devbrow v. Kalu, 705 F.3d 765, 769 (7th Cir. 2013) (“[N]ominal damages are\navailable as a remedy . . . [for an abstract injury].”).\n\n       3 The University’s argument that Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S.\n43 (1997) governs Fisher’s nominal monetary damages claim is without merit. Fisher does\nnot rely solely on a “general prayer for relief” to save a case otherwise falling outside an\nArticle III case or controversy from dismissal. Id. at 71. Fisher’s original complaint\nspecifically requested monetary damages.\n                                                 47\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 48      Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\nare by their very nature odious to a free people.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2418\n(quoting Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 517 (2000)).\n       When a state university makes race-conscious admissions decisions,\nthose decisions are governed by the Equal Protection Clause, even though they\nmay appear well-intended. See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n265, 297 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Simply put, the Constitution does not\ntreat race-conscious admissions programs differently because their stated aim\nis to help, not to harm.\n       Under strict scrutiny, a university’s use of racial classifications is\nconstitutional only if necessary and narrowly tailored to further a compelling\ngovernmental interest. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326. It is well-established that\nthere is a compelling governmental interest in obtaining the educational\nbenefits of a diverse student body. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311–12 (holding that\nthe “attainment of a diverse student body” is a “constitutionally permissible\ngoal for an institution of higher education”). Grutter and Gratz v. Bollinger,\n539 U.S. 244 (2003), confirmed this. See Fisher, 133 S. Ct at 2418. 4 “The\ndiversity that furthers a compelling [governmental] interest encompasses a far\nbroader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic\norigin is but a single though important element.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 515. Thus,\ndiversity cannot be defined by a “specified percentage of a particular group,”\nid. at 307, because such a definition would be “patently unconstitutional racial\nbalancing,” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330. In applying strict scrutiny, it is proper\nfor courts to defer to a university’s decision to pursue the compelling\ngovernmental interest of diversity based on its “educational judgment that\n\n\n\n       4 These principles are not challenged in this case. See infra note 8. However, I continue\nto believe that Grutter’s discussion of the “educational benefits of diversity,” drawing directly\nfrom the principles established in Bakke, “remains suspended at the highest levels of\nhypothesis and speculation,” Fisher, 631 F.3d at 255 (Garza, J., specially concurring).\n                                                  48\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085     Page: 49    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\nsuch diversity is essential to its educational mission.” Id. at 328. But, deference\nto the University is appropriate on this point, and this point alone. Fisher, 133\nS. Ct. at 2421.\n      Once a university has decided to pursue this compelling governmental\ninterest, it must prove that the means chosen “to attain diversity are narrowly\ntailored to that goal.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420. In this, the strict scrutiny test\ntakes the familiar form of a “means-to-ends” analysis: The compelling\ngovernmental interest is the ends, and the government program or law—here,\nthe University’s race-conscious admissions program—is the means. Strict\nscrutiny places the burden of proving narrow tailoring firmly with the\ngovernment. See Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505 (2005). And,\nfurthermore, narrow tailoring must be established “with clarity.” Fisher, 133\nS. Ct. at 2418.\n      Before this case, the Supreme Court had issued only three major\ndecisions addressing affirmative action in higher education admissions: Bakke,\nGratz, and Grutter. In Fisher, the Court made clear that this line of cases does\nnot stand apart from “broader equal protection jurisprudence.” Id. at 2418.\nRather, “the analysis and level of scrutiny applied to determine the validity of\n[a racial classification] do not vary simply because the objective appears\nacceptable . . . .” Id. at 2421 (quoting Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S.\n718, 724 n.9 (1982)).\n      In Fisher, the Supreme Court modified the narrow tailoring calculus\napplied in higher education affirmative action cases. While the overarching\nprinciples from Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter—that a university can have a\ncompelling interest in attaining the educational benefits of diversity, and that\nits admissions program must be narrowly tailored to serve this interest—were\ntaken “as given,” id. at 2417–18, the Fisher Court altered the application of\nthose principles in a critical way. Now, courts must give “no deference,” to a\n\n                                            49\n\f    Case: 09-50822         Document: 00512699085           Page: 50      Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                             No. 09-50822\n\nstate actor’s assertion that its chosen “means . . . to attain diversity are\nnarrowly tailored to that goal.” Id. at 2420. In so doing, the Fisher Court\nembraced Justice Kennedy’s position on “deference” from Grutter. 5 Thus, under\nthe current principles governing review of race-conscious admissions\nprograms, providing any deference to a state actor’s claim that its use of race\nis narrowly tailored is “antithetical to strict scrutiny, not consistent with it.”\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 394 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\n       Because the higher-education affirmative action cases do not stand apart\nfrom “broader equal protection jurisprudence,” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2418, strict\nscrutiny must be applied with the same analytical rigor deployed in those other\ncontexts. Put simply, there is no special form of strict scrutiny unique to higher\neducation admissions decisions. Accordingly, we must now evaluate narrow\ntailoring by ensuring that “the means chosen ‘fit’ the [compelling governmental\ninterest] so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the\nclassification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.” Croson, 488 U.S.\nat 493. 6 Narrow tailoring further requires that “the reviewing court verify that\nit is necessary for a university to use race to achieve the educational benefits\n\n\n\n       5  See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“[T]he majority proceeds to\nnullify . . . rigorous judicial review, with strict scrutiny as the controlling standard . . . . The\nCourt confuses deference to a university’s definition of its educational objective with\ndeference to the implementation of this goal.”). I agree with the majority that Fisher\nrepresents a decisive shift in the law. See ante, at 10 (“Bringing forward Justice Kennedy’s\ndissent in Grutter, the Supreme Court faulted the district court’s and this Court’s review of\nUT Austin’s means to achieve the permissible goal of diversity . . . .”); see also Erwin\nChemerinsky, The Court Affects Each of Us, 16 Green Bag 2d 361, 364 (2013) (“[Fisher] adopts\na tougher, less sympathetic tone when it comes to affirmative action programs. For example,\nin Grutter, the Court spoke of the need to defer to the judgment of colleges and universities.\nIn Fisher, the Court said that such deference was appropriate only as to the importance of\ndiversity; there is no deference given as to whether race is necessary to achieve it.”).\n\n       6 We need not determine whether the “strong basis in evidence” test from Croson\napplies in this case. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 510. Even without this test, the University fails\nto carry its strict scrutiny burden of proving that its race-conscious admissions policy is\nnecessary to further its diversity interest.\n                                                    50\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085         Page: 51     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nof diversity.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420 (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). To do so, we must carefully inquire into whether the University\n“could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.” Id.\nEstablishing narrow tailoring does not require the University to show that it\nexhausted every possible race-neutral option, but it must meet its “ultimate\nburden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that\navailable, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.” Id.\n       Of course, all of the above must be underscored by the principle that\nusing racial classifications is permissible only as a “last resort to achieve a\ncompelling interest.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.\n1, 551 U.S. 701, 790 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring). 7\n                                            III\n       Here, the University has framed its goal as obtaining a “critical mass” of\ncampus diversity. To uphold the use of race under strict scrutiny, courts must\nfind narrow tailoring through a close “fit” between this goal and the admissions\nprogram’s consideration of race. 8 Accordingly, the controlling question becomes\nthe definition of “critical mass”—the University’s stated goal. In order for us to\ndetermine whether its use of racial classifications in the admissions program\nis narrowly tailored to its goal, the University must explain its goal, and do so\n“with clarity.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2418. On this record, it has not done so.\n\n\n       7 Notwithstanding the majority’s brief discussion of Schuette v. Coalition to Defend\nAffirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means\nNecessary (BAMN), 134 S. Ct. 1623 (2014), ante at 25, that case “is not about the\nconstitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education,”\nand does not impact the analysis in today’s case. Schuette, 134 S. Ct. at 1630.\n\n       8 The University’s decision to pursue the educational benefits of diversity, as\nestablished in Bakke, is not challenged in this case. See Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2419 (“[T]he\nparties here do not ask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter’s holding.”). Our only\nconcern is whether the University’s means—its race-conscious holistic admissions program—\nare narrowly tailored to its diversity objective.\n\n                                                  51\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085      Page: 52    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\n      The majority entirely overlooks the University’s failure to define its\n“critical mass” objective for the purposes of assessing narrow tailoring. This is\nthe crux of this case—absent a meaningful explanation of its desired ends, the\nUniversity cannot prove narrow tailoring under its strict scrutiny burden.\nIndeed, the majority repeatedly invokes the term “critical mass” without even\nquestioning its definition. See, e.g., ante, at 23 (“But minority representation\nthen remained largely stagnant, within a narrow oscillating band, rather than\nmoving towards a critical mass of minority students.”); id. at 30 (“Achieving\nthe critical mass requisite to diversity goes astray when it drifts to numerical\nmetrics.”); id. (“Fisher refuses to acknowledge this distinction between critical\nmass—the tipping point of diversity—and a quota.”); id. at 34 (“Critical mass,\nthe tipping point of diversity, has no fixed upper bound of universal\napplication, nor is it the minimum threshold at which minority students do not\nfeel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.”). Under Fisher, it is not\nenough for a court to simply state, as does the majority, that it is not deferring\nto the University’s narrow tailoring arguments. See, e.g., id., at 17 (“Affording\nno deference, we look for narrow tailoring . . . .”). Rather, the reviewing court’s\nactual analysis must demonstrate that “no deference” has been afforded.\nFisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420. Here, the majority’s failure to make a meaningful\ninquiry into the nature of “critical mass” constitutes precisely such deference.\n      Certainly, as explained below, I agree that “critical mass” does not\nrequire a precise numerical definition. See infra note 11. But, to meet its\nnarrow tailoring burden, the University must explain its goal to us in some\nmeaningful way. We cannot undertake a rigorous ends-to-means narrow\ntailoring analysis when the University will not define the ends. We cannot tell\nwhether the admissions program closely “fits” the University’s goal when it\nfails to objectively articulate its goal. Nor can we determine whether\nconsidering race is necessary for the University to achieve “critical mass,” or\n\n                                           52\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085           Page: 53     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                            No. 09-50822\n\nwhether there are effective race-neutral alternatives, when it has not described\nwhat “critical mass” requires. 9\n        At best, the University’s attempted articulations of “critical mass”\nbefore this court are subjective, circular, or tautological. See infra Part III.A.\nThe University explains only that its “concept of critical mass is defined by\nreference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.”\nAnd, in attempting to address when it is likely to achieve critical mass, the\nUniversity explains only that it will “cease its consideration of race when it\ndetermines . . . that the educational benefits of diversity can be achieved at UT\nthrough a race-neutral policy . . . .” These articulations are insufficient. Under\nthe rigors of strict scrutiny, the judiciary must “verify that it is necessary for a\nuniversity to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.” Fisher,\n133 S. Ct. at 2420 (internal quotations omitted). It is not possible to perform\nthis function when the University’s objective is unknown, unmeasurable, or\nunclear.\n       The exacting scrutiny required by the Supreme Court’s “broader equal\nprotection jurisprudence” is entirely absent from today’s opinion, which holds\nthat the University has proven narrow tailoring even though it has failed to\nmeaningfully articulate its diversity goals.\n\n\n       9   There is some dispute about whether the University’s definition of “critical mass” is\neven before us as part of our narrow tailoring analysis. The University claims that this issue\nis outside the scope of the Supreme Court’s remand because it is relevant only to its\ncompelling interest in diversity. This contention misunderstands the way in which “critical\nmass” matters to this case. Here, “critical mass” represents the goal the University purports\nto seek. The University uses this term as a representation of its ends. Fisher clearly\nestablishes that reviewing courts must defer to the University’s decision to pursue such ends.\n133 S. Ct. at 2419. But, it equally establishes that we cannot defer to the University’s claim\nthat “the means chosen . . . to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.” Id. at 2420.\nTo conduct our own independent assessment of narrow tailoring—the judicial role under\nstrict scrutiny—we must have a clear and definite understanding of the goal the University\nactually seeks. Accordingly, we must question the University’s explanation of “critical mass”\nto fulfill the task remanded to us by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                                   53\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085         Page: 54     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\n                                             A\n       The University’s failure to define meaningfully its “critical mass”\nobjective is manifest in its various strict scrutiny arguments. The University\nclaims that its use of racial classifications is necessary and narrowly tailored\nbecause (1) quantitative metrics reflect an inadequate minority presence; (2)\nqualitative diversity is lacking; (3) certain selective colleges are insufficiently\ndiverse; (4) its periodic review demonstrates that its goals have not yet been\nachieved; and (5) its use of racial classifications is almost identical to that\napproved in Grutter. 10 Each of these arguments falls short—either overlooking\na more narrowly tailored alternative or eliding any articulation of how this\nspecific use of racial classification advances the University’s objective.\n                                             1\n       First, while not defining its “critical mass” goal with reference to specific\nquantitative objectives, the University claims that quantitative metrics are\nrelevant in measuring its progress. The University “based its critical mass\ndetermination on several data points, including hard data on minority\nadmissions, enrollment, and racial isolation” and found that its use of racial\nclassifications “does increase minority enrollment.” 11 Accepting that such\nmetrics bear some relevance to the University’s progress, this is insufficient to\nsatisfy strict scrutiny. The University does not explain how admitting a very\n\n\n       10 On remand, the University does not specifically delineate these arguments as such.\nRather, it submits that these various considerations are sufficient to establish narrow\ntailoring. In any event, whether taken together or evaluated individually, none of these\narguments establishes that the University’s use of racial classifications in its admissions\ndecisions is narrowly tailored.\n\n       11 I agree with the majority’s rejection of Fisher’s arguments that the University had\nachieved “critical mass” in 2004, and that “critical mass” can be defined with reference to\nnumbers alone. Fisher effectively asks us to ratify racial quotas, which we cannot, and will\nnot, do. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317–18 (disapproving quota systems and approving the use of\nrace or ethnic background as a “plus” factor).\n\n                                                 54\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 55     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nsmall number of minority applicants under the race-conscious admissions plan\nis necessary to advancing its diversity goal.\n       It is undeniable that the University admits only a small number of\nminority students under race-conscious holistic review. See Fisher, 631 F.3d at\n262–63 (Garza, J., specially concurring). In 2008, the sole year at issue in this\ncase, less than 20% of the class was evaluated under the race-conscious holistic\nreview process. Even if we assume that all minority students who were\nadmitted and enrolled in that year through the race-conscious holistic review\nprocess gained admission because of their race, this number is strikingly\nsmall—only 216 African-American and Hispanic students in an entering class\nof 6,322. 12 The University fails to explain how this small group contributes to\nits “critical mass” objective. “Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to\npermit any but the most exact connection between justification and [racial]\nclassification.” Adarand, 515 U.S. at 236 (emphasis added). But here, the\nUniversity has not established a clear and definite connection between its\nchosen means and its desired ends of “critical mass.”\n       To be clear, I agree that a race-conscious admissions plan need not have\na “dramatic or lopsided impact” on minority enrollment numbers to survive\nstrict scrutiny, as the University reads Fisher’s arguments to suggest. But\nneither can the University prove the necessity of its racial classification\nwithout meaningfully explaining how a small, marginal increase in minority\nadmissions is necessary to achieving its diversity goals. Thus, neither the small\n\n\n       12  Notwithstanding the University’s contention that 2008 witnessed an\n“unprecedented surge” in Top Ten Percent Law admissions, this is the only relevant year for\npurposes of our narrow tailoring analysis. Moreover, I continue to find the majority’s use of\ndata for both enrolled and admitted students to be misguided and potentially confusing. See\nante, at 35–37. In my view, the proper metric is enrolled students because we are assessing\nwhether the University’s means are narrowly tailored to its goal of attaining “the educational\nbenefits of diversity” on campus. See Fisher, 631 F.3d at 260 n.18 (Garza, J., specially\nconcurring).\n\n                                                 55\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085         Page: 56    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\n(and decreasing) percentage of minority holistic-review admittees, nor\nminorities’ “under-representation” in holistic review admissions relative to\nwhites, taken alone, demonstrates narrow tailoring. See ante, at 17–18 &\nAppendix 1 (explaining that white students comprise a larger percentage of\nholistic review admittees than of the incoming class as a whole). 13\n      Under the Equal Protection Clause, diversity cannot be assessed by\nstrictly quantitative metrics, and, to the extent that numbers could be relevant\nin assessing “critical mass,” the University leaves this relevance entirely\nunexplained.\n                                            2\n      The University advances a second understanding of “critical mass,”\nwhich I will refer to as “qualitative.” Under this theory, the University says its\ngoal is not boosting minority enrollment numbers alone, but rather promoting\nthe quality of minority enrollment—in short, diversity within diversity. The\nUniversity submits that its race-conscious holistic review allows it to select for\n“other types of diversity” beyond race alone, and to identify the most “talented,\nacademically promising, and well-rounded” minority students. According to\nthe University, these are crucial “change agents” who debunk stereotypes but\nwho may fall outside the top 10% of their high school classes.\n      As a preliminary matter, these stated ends are too imprecise to permit\nthe requisite strict scrutiny analysis. The University has not provided any\nconcrete targets for admitting more minority students possessing these unique\nqualitative-diversity characteristics—that is, the “other types of diversity”\nbeyond race alone. At what point would this qualitative diversity target be\n\n\n\n\n      13For example, for the incoming class that enrolled in 2008, white students comprised\n65% of all students admitted through holistic review, but only 52% of the entire incoming\nclass.\n                                                56\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 57     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\nachieved? Because its ends are unknown to us, the University cannot meet its\nstrict scrutiny burden.\n       But, even accepting the University’s broad and generic qualitative\ndiversity ends, we cannot conclude that the race-conscious policy is\nconstitutionally “necessary.” The University has not shown that qualitative\ndiversity is absent among the minority students admitted under the race-\nneutral Top Ten Percent Law, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 51.803 (West 2009). That\nis, the University does not evaluate the diversity present in this group before\ndeploying racial classifications to fill the remaining seats. The University does\nnot assess whether Top Ten Percent Law admittees exhibit sufficient diversity\nwithin diversity, whether the requisite “change agents” are among them, and\nwhether these admittees are able, collectively or individually, to combat\npernicious stereotypes. There is no such evaluation despite the fact that Top\nTen Percent Law admittees also submit applications with essays, and are even\nassigned PAI scores for purposes of admission to individual schools. 14\nEvaluating the composition of these admittees—80% of the class in 2008—\nbefore deploying racial classifications in the holistic admissions program might\nwell reveal that racial classifications are not necessary to achieve the\nUniversity’s qualitative diversity goals. See Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420; see also\nParents Involved, 551 U.S. at 790 (explaining that racial classifications must\nbe a “last resort to achieve a compelling interest” in order to survive strict\nscrutiny) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n       In effect, the University asks this Court to assume that minorities\nadmitted under the Top Ten Percent Law do not demonstrate “diversity within\n\n\n       14 Dr. Kedra Ishop, Associate Director of Admissions, explained that all applicant files\nare assigned an AI and PAI, and that the AI and PAI of a Top Ten Percent Law applicant can\nstill determine the program to which she is admitted, if her class rank is not high enough for\nautomatic admission to a competitive first-choice program such as the School of Business.\n\n                                                 57\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 58     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\ndiversity”—that they are somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and more\nundesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review. Thus, the\nUniversity claims, absent its race-conscious holistic admissions program, it\nwould lose the minority students necessary to achieving a qualitative critical\nmass. But it offers no evidence in the record to prove this, and we must\ntherefore refuse to make this assumption.\n       Regrettably, the majority firmly adopts this assumption—that minority\nstudents from majority-minority Texas high schools are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to contribute to the University’s vision of a diverse student body. 15\nThe majority reasons that race-conscious holistic review is a “necessary\ncomplement,” ante, at 30, to the Top Ten Percent Law, which, on its own, would\nadmit insufficient “students of unique talents and backgrounds who can enrich\nthe diversity of the student body in distinct ways,” id., at 29. The majority’s\ndiscussion of numerous “resegregated” Texas school districts is premised on\nthe dangerous assumption that students from those districts (at least those in\nthe top ten percent of each class) do not possess the qualities necessary for the\nUniversity of Texas to establish a meaningful campus diversity. See id., at 24–\n26. In this, it has embraced the very ill that the Equal Protection Clause seeks\nto banish. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 505 (“[R]acial characteristics so seldom\nprovide a relevant basis for disparate treatment.”); Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 523\n(“[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or\nethnic origin is inherently suspect.”) (Stewart, J., dissenting); Cayetano, 528\n\n\n       15 See ante, at 26 (discussing the “outcome gaps” of “segregated urban schools”); id. at\n26 (classifying schools according to their racial and ethnic compositions). Additionally, the\nmajority’s sua sponte survey of Texas school districts’ data on racial composition, test scores,\nand educational outcomes, id. at 26–28, ventures far beyond the summary judgment record.\nUnder strict scrutiny, the government bears the burden of establishing compliance with the\nConstitution. See Johnson, 543 U.S. at 505. More specifically, the Supreme Court’s opinion\nhas mandated that we decide whether “this record . . . is sufficient” to demonstrate narrow\ntailoring. Fisher, 133 S.

Ante, at 24–25 (“The de facto segregation of schools in Texas\nenables the Top Ten Percent Law to increase minorities in the mix, while\nignoring contributions to diversity beyond race.”). 16                   By accepting the\nUniversity’s standing presumption that minority students admitted under the\nTop Ten Percent Law do not possess the characteristics necessary to achieve a\ncampus environment defined by “qualitative diversity,” the majority engages\nin the very stereotyping that the Equal Protection Clause abhors. 17\n       The record does not indicate that the University evaluates students\nadmitted under the Top Ten Percent Law, checking for indicia of qualitative\ndiversity—diversity within diversity—before determining that race should be\nconsidered in the holistic review process to fill the remaining seats in the class.\nIf the Top Ten Percent Law admittees were a sufficiently qualitatively diverse\npopulation, which they may well be so far as I can tell, then using race in\nholistic review to promote further diversity might not be necessary for the\nUniversity to achieve its goal, and an up-front assessment of these admittees,\n\n\n\n       16 The majority’s reductionist assumption about the experiences of minority students\nadmitted under the Top Ten Percent Law is startling: “The top 29 graduates from Jack Yates\nHigh School in Houston live in the same predominately African-American neighborhood of\nthat city’s Third Ward, and thus likely experienced a similar cultural environment.” Ante, at\n24 n.98.\n\n       17 This stereotyping is not limited to minority students admitted under the Top Ten\nPercent Law. The majority further assumes that minority students admitted under holistic\nreview, based on their “experience of being a minority in a majority-white . . . school,” likely\n“demonstra[te] qualities of leadership and sense of self.” Ante, at 29. These conclusions are\nnonetheless stereotypes disallowed by the Fourteenth Amendment. And in any event, this\nrecord, by which we are bound, does not indicate that any minority students admitted under\nholistic review come from majority-white schools.

And, in any\nevent, the University offers no method for this court to determine when, if ever,\nits goal (which remains undefined) for qualitative diversity will be reached.\nAccordingly, the University has failed to carry its strict scrutiny burden of\nproving that its race-conscious admissions policy is necessary to achieving its\ndiversity objective of a “qualitative” critical mass.\n                                               3\n      In earlier stages of this case, the University framed its diversity goal as\nachieving “classroom diversity.” The University suggested that classroom\ndiversity and the distribution of minority students among colleges and majors\nwere meaningful metrics in determining whether “critical mass” had been\nattained. And, indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that increased\ndiversity of perspectives in the classroom provides for a “livelier, more spirited,\nand simply more enlightening and interesting” experience. Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 330 (quoting Bakke, 438, U.S. at 307). However, the University has\ndistanced itself from this previously asserted goal, now claiming it “has never\npursued classroom diversity as a discrete interest or endpoint,” but merely as\n“one of many factors” to be considered in evaluating diversity. Given the\nUniversity’s failure to press the classroom diversity argument in its briefing\non remand, the issue is almost certainly waived. See United States v. Griffith,\n522 F.3d 607, 610 (5th Cir. 2008) (“It is a well-worn principle that the failure\nto raise an issue on appeal constitutes waiver of that argument.”).\n      Notwithstanding this waiver, the majority addresses the issue of\nclassroom     diversity,    contending        that      the   University’s   race-conscious\nadmissions policy is necessary to give “high-scoring minority students a better\nchance   of   gaining      admission     to    UT       Austin’s     competitive   academic\ndepartments.” Ante, at 37. Perhaps, based on the structure of the University’s\nadmissions process, it is possible that the use of race as a factor in calculating\n\n                                                   60\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 61     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\nan applicant’s PAI score incrementally increases the odds that a minority\napplicant will be admitted to a competitive college within the University. 18 But\nhypothetical considerations are not enough to meet a state actor’s burden\nunder strict scrutiny. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)\n(“The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in\nresponse to litigation.”). Rather, assuming that the University’s diversity goal\nis establishing classroom diversity, it is the University that bears the burden\nof proving that the use of race in calculating the PAI scores is necessary to\nfurthering this goal. But instead of explaining how race enhances minority\nstudents’ prospects of admission to a competitive college or major, the\nUniversity admissions officers’ deposition testimony specifically indicates that\nrace could not be a decisive factor in any applicant’s admission, 19 and that it is\nimpossible to determine whether race was in fact decisive for any particular\n\n\n       18  The record describes the admissions process as follows: First, the admissions staff\nread all applicants’ files, including those of Top Ten Percent Law applicants, and assign each\nan AI and PAI score. Applicants with exceptionally high class rank or AI scores are\nautomatically admitted to certain first-choice schools or majors and, thus, also to the\nUniversity. Next, for applicants not automatically admitted to their first choice, the staff\ngenerate a matrix for each school with each cell on the matrix representing an intersection\nof AI and PAI scores. Working with liaisons from each school, the staff plot the remaining\napplicants’ scores on matrices according to the applicants’ first-choice majors. Based on the\nnumber of applicants in each matrix cell and the available seats in the class for each school,\nthe admissions staff and liaisons draw “cut-off lines” across the matrices. Applicants not\nselected for admission to their first-choice school “cascade” onto the matrix for their second-\nchoice school, where they are added to the cells along with applicants who were above the\ncut-off line during the previous review round. The cut-off lines are readjusted to accommodate\nthe additional students, and those remaining above the adjusted cut-off lines are accepted to\nthat school. Applicants not admitted to either their first- or second-choice school then\n“cascade” into the Liberal Arts Undecided matrix, which serves as the default third-choice\nmajor. Again, the admissions staff perform the line-drawing exercise (cognizant that\nremaining Top Ten Percent Law applicants must be admitted as Liberal Arts majors, thus\nreducing the number of available spaces), and a final determination is made for all\napplicants.\n\n       19 When asked whether any one factor in the PAI calculation could be determinative\nfor an applicant’s admission, Dr. Bruce Walker, Vice Provost and Director of Admissions,\nstated “no.”\n\n                                                 61\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 62     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\napplicant’s admission decision. 20 Absent any record evidence of the potential\nfor race to be a decisive factor, the University cannot establish, as the majority\nclaims, that its racial classifications could actually give any minority applicant\n“a better chance” of admission to a competitive college. Ante, at 37.\n        In short, the University has obscured its use of race to the point that\neven its own officers cannot explain the impact of race on admission to\ncompetitive colleges. 21 If race is indeed without a discernable impact, the\nUniversity cannot carry its burden of proving that race-conscious holistic\nreview is necessary to achieving classroom diversity (or, for that matter, any\nkind of diversity). Because the role played by race in the admissions decision\nis essentially unknowable, I cannot find that these racial classifications are\nnecessary or narrowly tailored to achieving the University’s interest in\ndiversity.\n                                              4\n       The University further claims that its race-conscious admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored because, with the help of a rigorous periodic\nreview system, it will “cease its consideration of race when it determines . . .\nthat the educational benefits of diversity can be achieved at [the University]\n\n\n\n       20Dr. Kedra Ishop was asked whether she could give an “example where race would\nhave some impact on an applicant’s personal achievement score?” Her answer: “In order to–\nit’s impossible to say–to give you an example of a particular student because it’s all\ncontextual.”\n\n       21 And race is entirely invisible at the moment of drawing the final admission cut-off\nlines, for students not automatically admitted to their first-choice program by virtue of an\nexceptionally high class rank or AI score. The University’s admissions staff and liaisons from\neach school admit students to the various schools and majors based solely on the combination\nof applicants’ AI and PAI scores. While race is considered in determining PAI scores, once\nthe scores are assigned and applicants are plotted on the matrices for the various schools,\nadmissions officers treat applicants as points on a grid. In other words, the University\nofficials have no way of knowing whether they are selecting applicants whose race\nincrementally boosted their PAI score, much less whether any particular applicant will help\nthe University improve classroom diversity.\n                                                  62\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085      Page: 63    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\nthrough a race-neutral policy ‘at reasonable cost’ to its other educational\nobjectives.” The University seeks to assure us that periodic review of its\nadmissions policy considers enrollment data, “evidence of racial isolation and\nthe racial climate on campus,” and “other data including the educational\nbenefits of diversity experienced in the classroom.” In simple language, the\nUniversity asserts that it knows critical mass when it sees it.\n      On one level, the University’s review process captures the essence of the\nholistic diversity interest established in Bakke, validated in Grutter, and left\nintact by Fisher. See Ante at 12 (“Diversity is a composite of the backgrounds,\nexperiences, achievements, and hardships of students to which race only\ncontributes.”). In fact, the Grutter Court discussed the important role that such\nreviews can play in determining whether racial classifications have continuing\nnecessity under strict scrutiny. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342.\n      Nonetheless, there are two distinct flaws with the University’s\nassurances that its own, internal, periodic review is sufficient to safeguard\nagainst any unconstitutional use of race. First, strict scrutiny does not allow\nthe judiciary to delegate wholesale to state actors the task of determining\nwhether a race-conscious admissions policy continues to be necessary. This is\nthe very point made by the Fisher Court, in vacating our previous opinion for\ndeferring to the University’s narrow-tailoring claims. Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at\n2420–21.\n      Second, while the University correctly considers a range of factors in its\nassessment of the necessity of its use of race, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315\n(describing diversity as a “broader array of qualifications and characteristics”\nof which race is only one), it has still not explained to us how this consideration\ntakes place. In describing its periodic review process, the University never\nexplains how the various factors are measured, the weight afforded to each,\n\n\n                                           63\n\f    Case: 09-50822         Document: 00512699085        Page: 64     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nand what combination thereof would yield a “critical mass” of diversity\nsufficient to cease use of racial classifications.\n        In light of this, I cannot determine that the race-conscious admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored to the University’s goal. The University, in effect,\ndefines critical mass as a nebulous amalgam of factors—enrollment data,\nracial isolation, racial climate, and “the educational benefits of diversity”—that\nits internal periodic review is calibrated to detect. But, without more, the\nUniversity fails to prove narrow tailoring with clarity. Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at\n2418.        Such a bare submission, in essence, begs for the deference that is\nirreconcilable with “meaningful” judicial review. Id. at 2421.\n                                              5\n        Lastly, the University submits that its race-conscious admissions policy\nnecessarily satisfies narrow tailoring because it is closely modeled on the\nadmissions program upheld by the Supreme Court in Grutter. Similarly, the\nmajority implies that the race-conscious admissions policy’s similarity to\nGrutter is, itself, a meaningful factor in our strict scrutiny analysis. 22 This\nclaim is unpersuasive.\n        Fisher confirms that we are obligated to consider the particular\nchallenged race-conscious program on its own terms and ask whether the\nUniversity        “could   achieve   sufficient    diversity     without     using     racial\nclassifications.” 133 S. Ct. at 2420. Strict scrutiny is not a hypothetical\nundertaking, but rather “imposes on the university the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available,\nworkable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n         See ante, at 16 (describing the University’s use of race with direct reference to the\n        22\n\nprogram approved in Grutter); id. at 29 (“UT Austin’s holistic review program—a program\nnearly indistinguishable from the University of Michigan Law School’s program in Grutter .\n. . .”).\n                                                  64\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 65      Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\n       Certain aspects of the University’s admissions policy do parallel the\nfeatures of the plan upheld in Grutter—race is only a sub-factor within a\nholistic, individualized review process, and the University’s goal is framed in\nterms of “critical mass.” But the University, under mandate by the Texas\nLegislature’s Top Ten Percent Law, admits the majority of its entering class\nthrough a separate, race-neutral scheme. 23 This inevitably impacts the narrow\ntailoring calculus presently under consideration. That is, while the\nUniversity’s race-conscious admissions policy is conceptually derived from the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School’s approach, the two are quite distinct in\npractice: The University’s holistic review coexists with a separate process that\nadmits a large population of students, a circumstance not contemplated in\nGrutter. 24\n       Similarity to Grutter is not a narrow-tailoring talisman that insulates\nthe University’s policy from strict scrutiny. The University’s burden is to prove\nthat its own use of racial classifications is necessary and narrowly tailored for\nachieving its own diversity objectives.\n\n\n\n\n       23    The majority implies that the University’s implementation of the Top Ten Percent\nLaw was discretionary. See ante, at 15 (“UT Austin turned to the Top Ten Percent Plan\n . . . .” (emphasis added)); id. at 16 (“We are offered no coherent response to the validity of a\npotentially different election by UT Austin: to invert the process and use Grutter’s holistic\nreview to select 80% or all of its students.” (emphasis added)). There was no such choice; the\nUniversity was mandated by the law to admit any graduate in the top ten percent of his or\nher high school class. And, as explained below, the Top Ten Percent Law is not challenged in\nthis appeal.\n\n        24 Additionally, I observe that the admissions program here and that in Grutter do not\n\nseem to use race in the same way. Even accepting that the University uses race as a “factor\nof a factor of a factor,” here, the University incorporates race into the PAI before individual\nadmissions decisions are made on the matrices, at which point race is invisible. See supra\nnote 21. By contrast, in Grutter, each law school applicant’s file, including his or her racial\nclassification, was considered during a holistic, full-file review. See 539 U.S. at 334–36.\n\n                                                  65\n\f    Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085        Page: 66   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\n                                          B\n      Ultimately, the record is devoid of any specifically articulated connection\nbetween the University’s diversity goal of “critical mass” and its race-conscious\nadmissions process. The University has not shown how it determines the\nexistence, or lack, of a “critical mass” of diversity in its student population.\nRather, the University only frames its goal as “obtaining the educational\nbenefits of diversity.” This is entirely circular reasoning that cannot satisfy\nthe rigorous means-to-ends analysis required under strict scrutiny. Fisher, 133\nS. Ct. at 2421.\n      To be clear, my concern is not with the University’s use of the term\n“critical mass” itself. Even if the University were to adopt another rhetorical\nconstruct to explain its diversity objectives, it faces the same underlying\nproblem—it does not offer a clear and definite articulation of its goal sufficient\nfor a reviewing court to verify narrow tailoring. The University’s failure to\nmeet its strict scrutiny burden is a function of its undefined ends, not its choice\nto label those ends as “critical mass.”\n                                          IV\n      The majority concludes that the University’s race-conscious admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored because the University has exhausted all\nworkable alternatives. Ante, at 41.       Much of today’s opinion explores the\nhistorical “narrative” of the University’s admissions process, including many\nrace-neutral recruitment programs intended to bolster minority enrollment.\nId. at 15. And, indeed, the University’s many efforts to achieve a diverse\ncampus learning environment without resorting to racial classifications are\ncommendable. But, framing this history as something akin to a process of\nelimination, the majority finds that the University’s race-conscious admissions\nprogram must be necessary and narrowly tailored to the University’s diversity\nobjectives. This is insufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.\n\n                                               66\n\f   Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085      Page: 67    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\n\n      Certainly, the University’s past experiences with race-neutral initiatives\nare relevant to the inquiry because the University must establish that “no\nworkable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of\ndiversity,” and because the University’s “experience and expertise” provide\nsome context to inform judicial review. Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420. However,\nwe cannot conclude that the University’s current race-conscious admissions\nprogram—the only matter before this court—is narrowly tailored to achieve\nthe educational benefits of diversity because the University has failed to define\nwhat it means by “critical mass.” In other words, the University’s long history\nof purportedly unsuccessful alternatives is meaningless if we cannot discern\nthe contours of the success it now seeks.\n      Additionally, the majority’s sustained focus on the Top Ten Percent Law\nis misplaced. While the Law is indeed central to this case, here, as in our\nprevious consideration of this appeal, “[n]o party challenged, in the district\ncourt or in this court, the validity or the wisdom of the Top Ten Percent Law.”\nFisher, 631 F.3d at 247 (King, J., specially concurring). Nevertheless, the\nmajority forcefully indicts the Law for frustrating the University’s efforts to\nachieve well-rounded diversity. In the majority’s view, the Law’s shortcomings\nmake a holistic review program more necessary.              Ante, at 30 (“We are\npersuaded that holistic review is a necessary complement to the Top Ten\nPercent Plan, enabling it to operate without reducing itself to a cover for a\nquota system . . . .”). At most, the Law’s mechanical operation—admitting\nstudents based on the sole metric of high school class rank—might suggest that\nsome form of holistic review is advisable to supplement the admissions process.\nBut this issue is not before us at all. Our task is to determine whether the\nUniversity’s injection of race into its admissions process survives strict\nscrutiny.\n\n\n                                            67\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085             Page: 68   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\n       The Top Ten Percent Law matters only insofar as it causes the\nUniversity to admit a large number of minority students separate and apart\nfrom the holistic review process. That is, the Law creates a separate\nadmissions channel for many minority students, which then calls into question\nthe necessity of using race as a factor in the holistic review process for filling\nthe remaining seats. Whether, in light of the Top Ten Percent Law, race-\nconscious holistic review is more or less necessary is an open question, and it\nis the University that bears the burden of explaining how the Law impacts its\nachievement of its diversity goal. Here, it has failed to do so, under any theory\nof “critical mass” it has proffered. 25\n                                       *       *        *\n       The material facts of this case have remained unchanged since the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment, but the governing law has changed\nmarkedly. Fisher established that strict scrutiny in the higher education\naffirmative action setting is no different than strict scrutiny in other equal\nprotection contexts—the state actor receives no deference in proving that its\nchosen race-conscious means are narrowly tailored to its ends. The majority\nfails to give Fisher its proper weight. Today’s opinion sidesteps the new strict\nscrutiny standard and continues to defer to the University’s claims that its use\nof racial classifications is narrowly tailored to its diversity goal. Because the\n\n\n       25 There are additional elements of the majority’s discussion of the Top Ten Percent\nLaw that I cannot join. First, to bolster the “necessity” of race-conscious holistic review, the\nmajority explains that holistic-review admittees have higher standardized test scores. Ante,\nat 24 & nn. 96–97. However, no testimony or record evidence establishes whether the gap in\nSAT scores between Top Ten Percent and Non-Top Ten Percent admittees is statistically\nsignificant. And as the University’s president explained in 2000, “top 10 percent high school\nstudents make much higher grades in college than non-top 10 percent students,” and\n“[s]trong academic performance in high school is an even better predictor of success in college\nthan standardized test scores.” At best, the academic superiority of holistic review admittees\nas a group is highly contested. Second, legislative changes to the Top Ten Percent Law after\n2008, the relevant year for our purposes, are not germane to our analysis. See ante, at 32\n(discussing S.B. 175).\n                                                   68\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085       Page: 69   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\nUniversity has not defined its diversity goal in any meaningful way—instead,\nreflexively reciting the term “critical mass”—it is altogether impossible to\ndetermine whether its use of racial classifications is narrowly tailored.\n      This is not to say, however, that it is impossible for a public university\nto define its diversity ends adequately for a court to verify narrow tailoring\nwith the requisite exacting scrutiny. After all, “[s]trict scrutiny must not be\nstrict in theory but fatal in fact.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2421 (internal quotations\nomitted). It may even be possible for a university to do so while seeking a\n“critical mass.” What matters now, after Fisher, is that a state actor’s diversity\ngoals must be sufficiently clear and definite such that a reviewing court can\nassess, without deference, whether its particular use of racial classifications is\nnecessary and narrowly tailored to those goals. On this record, the University\nhas not “offered sufficient evidence that would prove that its admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”\nFisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2421. Accordingly, I would reverse and render judgment\nfor Fisher.\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                           69\n\f",

UT Austin notes that in its remanding language, the\nSupreme Court cites Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 33 where the court of\nappeals remanded to the district court after the Supreme Court vacated the\njudgment of the court of appeals for failure to apply strict scrutiny. Finally,\nUT Austin argues that the remand language, at best, is ambiguous and, given\nthe custom of the courts of appeals, should not be read to foreclose the clear\ndiscretion of this Court to remand absent specific, contrary instructions from\nthe Supreme Court.\n      Given the customary practice of the courts of appeals and the less than\nclear language of the Supreme Court’s remand, we are not persuaded that the\nSupreme Court intended to foreclose our discretion to remand to the district\ncourt.

Yet, this is telling. Had the Supreme Court intended to control the\ndiscretion of this Court as to whether the district court should first address an\nerror that the Supreme Court found was made by both courts, there would have\nbeen no uncertainty in the remand language. The question whether we should\nremand remains.\n                                              B\n      There is no clear benefit to remanding this case to the district court. The\nsuggestion, without more, that discovery may be necessary given the Supreme\nCourt’s holding regarding proper scrutiny and deference adds nothing.\nAdmittedly, this case differs from Grutter, in that Grutter went to trial. And\nevidence offered by live witnesses is far more likely to surface and resolve fact\nissues than summary judgment evidence crafted by advocates. But that too is\nfar from certain. Indeed, UT Austin’s argument goes no further than “factual\nquestions or disputes may arise on remand.” 34 Notably, UT Austin does not\nargue that a trial will be necessary. Rather its principal target on remand is\nstanding, with questions that continue to haunt, but are foreclosed by the\nSupreme Court’s implicit finding of standing, questions only it can now\naddress.\n      We find that there are no new issues of fact that need be resolved, nor is\nthere any identified need for additional discovery; that the record is sufficiently\ndeveloped; and that the found error is common to both this Court and the\ndistrict court. It follows that a remand would likely result in duplication of\neffort. We deny UT Austin’s motion for remand, and turn to the merits.\n\n\n\n\n      34   Defs.’ Mot. to Remand at 4.\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085       Page: 10     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n                                           III\n                                            A\n      In remanding, the Supreme Court held that its decision in Grutter\nrequires that “strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program using\nracial categories or classifications”; 35 that “racial classifications are\nconstitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling\ngovernmental interests.” 36      Bringing forward Justice Kennedy’s dissent in\nGrutter, the Supreme Court faulted the district court’s and this Court’s review\nof UT Austin’s means to achieve the permissible goal of diversity—whether UT\nAustin’s efforts were narrowly tailored to achieve the end of a diverse student\nbody. Our charge is to give exacting scrutiny to these efforts.\n      The Supreme Court has made clear that “a university’s educational\njudgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to\nwhich we defer.” 37 The “decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow\nfrom student body diversity that the University deems integral to its mission\nis, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but not\ncomplete, judicial deference is proper under Grutter.” 38 Accordingly, a court\n“should ensure that there is a reasoned, principled explanation for the\nacademic decision.” 39\n      In both Fisher and Grutter, the Supreme Court endorsed Justice Powell’s\nconclusion that “attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a constitutionally\npermissible goal for an institution of higher education;” 40 that in contrast to\n\n\n\n      35 Fisher, 133 S.

Thus, Fisher\nargues, the race-conscious admissions policy had a de minimis effect, at most\nadding 0.92% African-American enrollment and 2.5% Hispanic enrollment;\nthat a slight contribution is not a “constitutionally meaningful” impact on\nstudent body diversity and is no more than an exercise in gratuitous racial\nengineering.\n      This effort to truncate the inquiry clings to a baseline that crops events\nFisher’s claim ignores, as it must.

Texas 65 decision, UT Austin faced a\nnearly intractable problem: achieving diversity—including racial diversity—\nessential to its educational mission, while not facially considering race even as\none of many components of that diversity. Forbidden any use of race after\nHopwood, UT Austin turned to the Top Ten Percent Plan, which guarantees\nTexas residents graduating in the top ten percent of their high school class\nadmission to any public university in Texas. Such a mechanical admissions\nprogram could have filled every freshman seat but standing alone it was not a\nworkable means of achieving the diversity envisioned by Bakke, bypassing as\nit did high-performing multi-talented students, minority and non-minority.\n\n\n      65   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714814\"><a href=\"/opinion/714814/cheryl-j-hopwood-v-state-of-texas-v-thurgood-marshall-legal-society-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1996), abrogated by Grutter, 539 U.S. at 322.\n                                              15\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085        Page: 16     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\nWith its blindness to all but the single dimension of class rank, the Top Ten\nPercent Plan came with significant costs to diversity and academic integrity,\npassing over large numbers of highly qualified minority and non-minority\napplicants. The difficulties of Texas’s and other states’ percentage plans did\nnot escape the Court in Grutter, which explained that “even assuming such\nplans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the\nindividualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not\njust racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the\nuniversity.” 66\n      Nor did these difficulties escape the Texas legislature. Opponents to the\nproposed plan noted that such a policy “could actually harm institutions” and\n“would not solve the problems created by [Hopwood].” 67 So the legislature\nadopted a Top Ten Percent Plan that left a substantial number of seats to a\ncomplementary holistic review process. Foreshadowing Grutter, admission\nsupplementing the Top Ten Percent Plan included factors such as socio-\neconomic diversity and family educational achievements but, controlled by\nHopwood, it did not include race.           In short, a holistic process sans race\ncontrolled the gate for the large percent of applicants not entering through the\nTop Ten Percent Plan.

Grutter blessed an\nadmissions program, applied to the entire pool of students competing for\nadmission, which “considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to\nassemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.” Affording\nno deference, we look for narrow tailoring in UT’s Austin’s use of this\nindividualized race-conscious holistic review, applied as it is only to a small\nfraction of the student body as the rest is consumed by race-neutral efforts.\n      Close scrutiny of the data in this record confirms that holistic review—\nwhat little remains after over 80% of the class is admitted on class rank alone—\ndoes not, as claimed, function as an open gate to boost minority headcount for\na racial quota.       Far from it.      The increasingly fierce competition for the\ndecreasing number of seats available for Texas students outside the top ten\npercent results in minority students being under-represented—and white\nstudents being over-represented—in holistic review admissions relative to the\nprogram’s impact on each incoming class. In other words, for each year since\nthe Top Ten Percent Plan was created through 2008, holistic review\ncontributed a greater percentage of the incoming class of Texans as a whole\nthan it did the incoming minority students. Examples illustrate this effect. Of\nthe incoming class of 2008, the year Fisher applied for admission, holistic\nreview contributed 19% of the class of Texas students as a whole—but only\n12% of the Hispanic students and 16% of the black students, while contributing\n24% of the white students. 68 The incoming class of 2005, the year that the\nGrutter plan was first introduced, is similar. That year, 31% of the class of\nTexas students as a whole was admitted through holistic review (with the\nremaining 69% of incoming seats for Texans filled by the Top Ten Percent\nPlan)—but only 21% of the Hispanic Texan students in the incoming class were\n\n\n      68   2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 7 tbl.1a.\n                                              17\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 18     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\nadmitted through holistic review, and 26% of the incoming black Texan\nstudents, but 35% of the incoming white Texan students. 69 Minorities being\nunder-represented in holistic review admission relative to the impact of holistic\nreview on the class as a whole holds true almost without exception for both\nblacks and Hispanics for every year from 1996–2008, 70 and can be seen in the\nchart attached to this opinion at Appendix 1.\n       Given the test score gaps between minority and non-minority applicants,\nif holistic review was not designed to evaluate each individual’s contributions\nto UT Austin’s diversity, including those that stem from race, holistic\nadmissions would approach an all-white enterprise.

With each entering class, there was a gap\nbetween the lower standardized test scores of students admitted under the Top\nTen Percent Plan and the higher scores of those admitted under holistic review.\nFor example, in 2008—the year Fisher applied for admission—81% of the seats\navailable to Texas residents were taken up by the Top Ten Percent Plan. 95\nThese Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test score of\n\n\n\n       91 Id.

The de facto\nsegregation of schools in Texas 98 enables the Top Ten Percent Plan to increase\n\n\n\n       96  Id. Data for the preceding years showed a similar test score gap. For the entering\nTexas class of 2007, Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test score of 1225\nversus the average standardized test score of 1246 attained by non-Top Ten Percent Texas\nstudents. Similarly, in 2006, Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test\nscore of 1220 versus an average standardized test score of 1257 for non-Top Ten Percent\nstudents. For 2005, Top Ten Percent students had an average standardized test score of 1226\nversus an average standardized test score of 1277 for non-Top Ten Percent students.

Id.\n        97 Id. at 9, 13–15. For minority students, difference in average standardized test\n\nscores between admitted Texas Top Ten Percent students and non-Top Ten Percent students\nfluctuated in size but remained significant in the pre- and post-Grutter years leading up to\nFisher’s application. Among Hispanic students, the gap was 1100 versus 1189 in 2003; 1110\nversus 1189 in 2004; 1122 versus 1193 in 2005; 1105 versus 1154 in 2006; and 1115 versus\n1155 in 2007. For African-American students, the gap was 1063 versus 1065 in 2003; 1046\nversus 1116 in 2004; 1059 versus 1118 in 2005; 1067 versus 1086 in 2006; and 1078 versus\n1073 in 2007. See id. at 14–15. And a comparison of raw SAT scores does not\ntell the full story, as SAT scores are scaled. See, e.g., CollegeBoard SAT, 2006\nCollege-Bound       Seniors:   Total   Group    Profile    Report     (2006),     available  at\nhttp://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/cb-seniors-2006-national-\nreport.pdf. Looking at the percentile point gives a better picture. For SAT test-takers in\n2006, the 50th percentile combined score was 1020, while a 75th percentile score was 1180,\na mere 160 points higher. Id. at 2. Thus, a score differential of 80 points, for example, which\nrepresents the approximate differential between holistic review and Top Ten Percent\nHispanic admittees, represents students scoring at approximately a 12–13 higher percentile.\n        98 For example, only 8.1% of all students in Houston ISD are white. See Houston\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 2011–2012 Facts and Figures 1 (2012). Similarly, only 4.6% of students in\nthe Dallas Independent School District are white. See Dallas Indep. Sch.

Texas is here an active\nlab of experimentation embraced by the Court in Schuette v. BAMN. 100 We\nreference here these unchallenged facts of resegregation not in justification of\na racial remedy, but because the racial makeup and relative performance of\nTexas high schools bear on the workability of an alternative to any use of race\nfor 80% of student admissions to UT Austin. The political branches opted for\nthis facially race-neutral alternative—a narrow tailoring in implementation of\ntheir goal of diversity.\n       Fisher’s claim can proceed only if Texas must accept this weakness of the\nTop Ten Percent Plan and live with its inability to look beyond class rank and\nfocus upon individuals. Perversely, to do so would put in place a quota system\npretextually race neutral. While the Top Ten Percent Plan boosts minority\nenrollment by skimming from the tops of Texas high schools, it does so against\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Indep. Sch. Dist., Facts and Figures (2012). This de facto school segregation stems\nfrom residential patterns and means that students in the top ten percent of a highly\nsegregated school likely grew up in the same residential zone. The top 29 graduates from\nJack Yates High School in Houston live in the same predominately African-American\nneighborhood of that city’s Third Ward, and thus likely experienced a similar cultural\nenvironment. See Amicus Curiae Br. of the Family of Heman Sweatt (Oct. 31, 2013) at 27.\nThis pattern repeats itself across the high schools of Texas’s urban areas.\n       99 Schuette v.

That other students are left out—those\nwho fell outside their high school’s top ten percent but excelled in unique ways\nthat would enrich the diversity of UT Austin’s educational experience—leaves\na gap in an admissions process seeking to create the multi-dimensional\ndiversity that Bakke envisions.\n                                          C\n      UT     Austin’s     holistic    review    program—a        program      nearly\nindistinguishable from the University of Michigan Law School’s program in\nGrutter—was a necessary and enabling component of the Top Ten Percent Plan\nby allowing UT Austin to reach a pool of minority and non-minority students\nwith records of personal achievement, higher average test scores, or other\nunique skills. A variety of perspectives, that is differences in life experiences,\nis a distinct and valued element of diversity. Yet a significant number of\nstudents excelling in high-performing schools are passed over by the Top Ten\nPercent Plan although they could bring a perspective not captured by\nadmissions along the sole dimension of class rank. For example, the experience\nof being a minority in a majority-white or majority-minority school and\nsucceeding in that environment offers a rich pool of potential UT Austin\nstudents with demonstrated qualities of leadership and sense of self. Efforts\nto draw from this pool do not demean the potential of Top Ten admittees.\nRather it complements their contribution to diversity—mitigating in an\nimportant way the effects of the single dimension process.\n      UT Austin persuades that this reach into the applicant pool is not a\nfurther search for numbers but a search for students of unique talents and\nbackgrounds who can enrich the diversity of the student body in distinct ways\nincluding test scores, predicting higher levels of preparation and better\nprospects for admission to UT Austin’s more demanding colleges and\nultimately graduation. It also signifies that this is a draw from a highly\n                                         29\n\f   Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085     Page: 30   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 09-50822\ncompetitive pool, a mix of minority and non-minority students who would\notherwise be absent from a Top Ten Percent pool selected on class rank, a\nrelative and not an independent measure across the pool of applicants.\n                                       VI\n      These realities highlight the difficulty of an approach that seeks to couch\nthe concept of critical mass within numerical terms. The numbers support UT\nAustin’s argument that its holistic use of race in pursuit of diversity is not\nabout quotas or targets, but about its focus upon individuals, an opportunity\ndenied by the Top Ten Percent Plan. Achieving the critical mass requisite to\ndiversity goes astray when it drifts to numerical metrics.     UT Austin urges\nthat it has made clear that looking to numbers, while relevant, has not been\nits measure of success; and that its goals are not captured by population ratios.\nWe find this contention proved, mindful that by 2011, Texas high school\ngraduates were majority-minority.\n      UT Austin urges that its first step in narrow tailoring was the admission\nof over 80% of its Texas students though a facially race-neutral process, and\nthat Fisher’s embrace of the sweep of the Top Ten Percent Plan as a full\nachievement of diversity reduces critical mass to a numerical game and little\nmore than a cover for quotas. Fisher refuses to acknowledge this distinction\nbetween critical mass—the tipping point of diversity—and a quota. And in\nseeking to quantify “critical mass” as a rigid numerical goal, Fisher misses the\nmark. Fisher is correct that if UT Austin defined its goal of diversity by the\nnumbers only, the Top Ten Percent Plan could be calibrated to meet that mark.\nTo do so, however, would deny the role of holistic review as a necessary\ncomplement to Top Ten Percent admissions. We are persuaded that holistic\nreview is a necessary complement to the Top Ten Percent Plan, enabling it to\noperate without reducing itself to a cover for a quota system; that in doing so,\n\n\n                                       30\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085         Page: 31    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\nits limited use of race is narrowly tailored to this role—as small a part as\npossible for the Plan to succeed.\n                                            A\n      The Top Ten Percent Plan is dynamic, its take floating year to year with\nthe number of Texas high school graduates in the top ten percent of their class\nthat choose to capitalize on their automatic admission to the flagship\nuniversity. Its impact on the composition of each incoming class predictably\nhas grown dramatically, leaving ever fewer holistic review seats available for\nthe growing demographic of Texas high school graduates. In 1996, when the\nTop Ten Percent Plan was introduced, it admitted 42% of the Texas incoming\nclass; by 2005, when the Grutter plan was introduced, the Plan occupied 69%\nof the seats available to Texas residents; by 2008, when Fisher applied for\nadmission, it had swelled to 81%. 121 The increasing take of the Top Ten\nPercent Plan both enhanced its strengths and exacerbated its inherent\nweaknesses in composing the UT student body, as the overwhelming majority\nof seats was granted to students without the facial use of race but also without\nconsideration of experiences beyond a single academic dimension. So as the\ntake of the Top Ten Percent Plan grew, so also did the necessity of a\ncomplementary holistic admissions program to achieve the diversity\nenvisioned by Bakke.\n       A quick glance in the public record of data since 2008 confirms that UT\nAustin’s race-conscious holistic review program has a self-limiting nature, one\nthat complements UT Austin’s periodic review of the program’s necessity to\nensure it is limited in time. For the entering class of 2009, the year after Fisher\n\n\n      121 In 1996, the Top Ten Percent Plan admitted 41.8% of the incoming class of Texas\nstudents; 36.6% in 1997; 41.1% in 1998; 44.9% in 1999; 47.4% in 2000; 51.3% in 2001; 54.4%\nin 2002; 70.4% in 2003; 66.3% in 2004; 68.7% in 2005; 71.4% in 2006; 70.6% in 2007; and\n80.9% in 2008. See 2006 Top Ten Percent Report at 5 tbl.1a (data for years 1996–2005); 2008\nTop Ten Percent Report at 7 tbl.1a (data for 2006–2008).\n                                            31\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 32     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\napplied for admission, the Top Ten Percent Plan’s take of the seats available\nfor Texas residents swelled to 86% and remained at 85% in 2010. 122\n       This trend did not escape the Texas Legislature. Consistent with its\nlong-standing view of holistic review as a crucial complement to the Top Ten\nPercent Plan, Texas passed Senate Bill 175 of the 81st Texas Legislature (SB\n175) in 2009. SB 175 modified the Top Ten Percent Plan for UT Austin to\nauthorize the University “to limit automatic admission to no less than 75% of\nits enrollment capacity for first-time resident undergraduate students\nbeginning with admission for the entering class of 2011 and ending with the\nentering class of 2015.” 123 Pursuant to SB 175, UT Austin restricted automatic\nadmissions to the top 7% for Fall 2014 and Fall 2015 applicants, to the top 8%\nfor Fall 2011 and Fall 2013 applicants, and to the top 9% for Fall 2012\napplicants. 124    All remaining slots continue to be filled through holistic\nreview. 125 For the entering class of 2011, the first affected by SB 175, 74% of\nenrolled Texas residents were automatically admitted (with a higher\npercentage of offers of admission), a figure that again was pushed upward by\ninherent population forces, to 77% for the entering Texas class of 2013. 126\n       In the growing shadow of the Top Ten Percent Plan, there was a cautious,\ncreeping numerical increase in minority representation following the inclusion\nof race and ethnicity in the holistic review program, a testament, UT Austin\nsays, to its race-conscious holistic review. We must agree.

The trend has\ncontinued since, climbing to 5.13% in 2006, 5.41% in 2007, and 5.67% in 2008.\nSimilarly, the percentage of Hispanic admitted students climbed from 16.21%\nin 2004, to 17.88% in 2005, 18.08% in 2006, 19.07% in 2007, and 20.41% in\n2008. 127 The modest numbers only validate the targeted role of UT Austin’s\nuse of Grutter. Nor can they be viewed as a pretext for quota seeking—an\nassertion of Fisher’s belied by the reality that over this time frame graduating\nTexas high school seniors approached being majority-minority. The small\nincreases do not exceed critical mass nor imply a quota but instead bring a\ndistinct dimension of diversity to the Top Ten Percent Plan. To be sure, critical\nmass can be used as a cover for quotas and proportionality goals, but it is not\ninevitable; UT Austin persuades that viewed objectively, under its structure,\nits efforts in holistic review have not been simply to expand the numbers but\nrather the diversity of individual contributions.\n      Turning in the opposite direction from her claim of racial quotas, Fisher\nfaults UT Austin’s holistic use of race for its de minimis contribution to\ndiversity. UT Austin replies that this turns narrow tailoring upside down. We\nagree. Holistic review allows selection of an overwhelming number of students\nby facially neutral measures and for the remainder race is only a factor of\nfactors. Fisher’s focus on the numbers of minorities admitted through the\nholistic gate relative to those admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan is\nflawed, ignoring its role as a necessary complement to the Plan. The apt\nquestion is its contribution to the richness of diversity as envisioned by Bakke\nagainst the backdrop of the Top Ten Percent Plan. That is its palliative role\n\n\n      127   2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6 tbl.1.\n                                              33\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085     Page: 34   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 09-50822\nclaimed by UT Austin. So viewed, holistic review’s low production of numbers\nis its strength, not its weakness.\n      In sum, Fisher points to the numbers and nothing more in arguing that\nrace-conscious admissions were no longer necessary because a “critical mass”\nof minority students had been achieved by the time Fisher applied for\nadmission—a head count by skin color or surname that is not the diversity\nenvisioned by Bakke and a measure it rejected. In 2007, Fisher emphasizes,\nthere were 5.8% African-American and 19.7% Hispanic enrolled students,\nwhich exceeds pre-Hopwood levels and the minority enrollment at the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School examined in Grutter. But an examination\nthat looks exclusively at the percentage of minority students fails before it\nbegins. Indeed, as Grutter teaches, an emphasis on numbers in a mechanical\nadmissions process is the most pernicious of discriminatory acts because it\nlooks to race alone, treating minority students as fungible commodities that\nrepresent a single minority viewpoint. Critical mass, the tipping point of\ndiversity, has no fixed upper bound of universal application, nor is it the\nminimum threshold at which minority students do not feel isolated or like\nspokespersons for their race. Grutter defines critical mass by reference to a\nbroader view of diversity rather than by the achievement of a certain quota of\nminority students. Here, UT Austin has demonstrated a permissible goal of\nachieving the educational benefits of diversity within that university’s distinct\nmission, not seeking a percentage of minority students that reaches some\narbitrary size.\n      Implicitly conceding the need for holistic review, Fisher offers\nsocioeconomic disadvantage as a race-neutral alternative in holistic review.\nUT Austin points to widely accepted scholarly work concluding that “there are\nalmost six times as many white students as black students who both come from\n[socio-economically disadvantaged] families and have test scores that are\n                                       34\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085       Page: 35    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\nabove the threshold for gaining admission at an academically selective college\nor university.” 128   At bottom, the argument is that minority students are\ndisadvantaged by class, not race; the socioeconomic inquiry is a neutral proxy\nfor race. Bakke accepts that skin color matters—it disadvantages and ought\nnot be relevant but it is. We are ill-equipped to sort out race, class, and\nsocioeconomic structures, and Bakke did not undertake to do so. To the point,\nwe are ill-equipped to disentangle them and conclude that skin color is no\nlonger an index of prejudice; that we would will it does not make it so.\n      We are satisfied that UT Austin has demonstrated that race-conscious\nholistic review is necessary to make the Top Ten Percent Plan workable by\npatching the holes that a mechanical admissions program leaves in its ability\nto achieve the rich diversity that contributes to its academic mission—as\ndescribed by Bakke and Grutter.\n                                           B\n      Over the history of holistic review, its intake of students has declined,\nminority and non-minority, and changed the profile of the students it admits—\nthe growing number of applicants and increasing take of the Top Ten Percent\nPlan raises the competitive bar each year, before race is ever considered, for\nthe decreasing number of seats filled by holistic review. Those admitted are\nthose that otherwise would be missed in the diversity mix— for example, those\nwith special talents beyond class rank and identifiable at the admission gate,\nand minorities with the experience of attending an integrated school with\nbetter educational resources.\n      The data also show that white students are awarded the overwhelming\nmajority of the highly competitive holistic review seats. As we have explained\n\n\n\n      128 Supp. Br. of Appellee at 30 (citing William G. Bowen & Derek Bok, The Shape of\nthe River 51 (1998)).\n                                          35\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085        Page: 36     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\nand as shown in Appendix 2, the increasing take of the Top Ten Percent Plan\nis inherently self-limiting. UT Austin has demonstrated that it is on a path\nthat each year reduces the role of race.           After the Top Ten Percent Plan\nswallowed 81% of the seats available for Texas students in 2008, for example,\nwhite Texan students admitted through holistic review occupied an additional\n12% of the overall seats. Only 2.4% and 0.9% of the incoming class of Texas\nhigh school graduates were Hispanic and black students admitted through\nholistic review.      That is, admission via the holistic review program—\noverwhelmingly and disproportionally of white students—is highly competitive\nfor minorities and non-minorities alike. These data persuade us of the force of\nUT Austin’s argument that a limited use of race is necessary to target\nminorities with unique talents and higher test scores to add the diversity\nenvisioned by Bakke to the student body.\n      Numbers are not controlling but they are relevant to UT Austin’s\nclaimed need for holistic review as a necessary component of its admission\nprogram.     In 2005, the first class that included race and ethnicity in holistic\nreview, 176 (29%) of 617 total African-American admitted students were\nadmitted via holistic review. 129 Following years were similar, with 32% of\nadmitted African-Americans in 2006, 35% in 2007, and 20% in 2008. 130\nLikewise, significant percentages of Hispanic admitted students were\nadmitted through the holistic review program, making up 24% of the admitted\nHispanic pool in 2005, 26% in 2006, 25% in 2007, and 15% in 2008. 131 These\nnumbers directly support UT Austin’s contention that holistic use of race plays\na necessary role in enabling it to achieve diversity while admitting upwards of\n\n\n\n      129 See 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 8 tbl.2 (providing the percentage of students\nadmitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan by racial and ethnic background).\n      130 Id.\n      131 Id.\n\n                                           36\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085      Page: 37    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n80% of its Texas students by facially neutral standards, drawing as it does from\na pool not measured solely by class rank in largely segregated schools.\n                                        C\n      Recall the 3.5 AI threshold that excluded Fisher. Holistic review for the\ncolleges to which Fisher applied only admitted applicants—minority or non-\nminority—with a minimum AI score of 3.5. This effectively added to the mix a\npool of applicants from which those colleges could admit students with higher\ntest scores and a higher predicted level of performance, despite being outside\nthe top ten percent of their class, as part of a greater mosaic of talents. Insofar\nas some dispersion of minority students among many classes and programs is\nimportant to realizing the educational benefits of diversity, race-conscious\nholistic review is a necessary complement to the Top Ten Percent Plan by\ngiving high-scoring minority students a better chance of gaining admission to\nUT Austin’s competitive academic departments. Fisher’s proffered solution is\nfor UT Austin’s more competitive academic programs to lower their gates. But\nthis misperceives the source of the AI threshold for admission into the\ncompetitive colleges: These programs fill 75% of their seats from the pool of\nstudents automatically admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan. The large\nnumber of holistic review candidates competing for the quarter of the\nremaining seats dictates the high AI threshold that all applicants—minority\nor non-minority—must meet to qualify for admission. Fisher also points to\nweak dispersal across classes as evidence of UT Austin’s pursuit of numbers.\nIt is precisely the opposite. We repeat, holistic review’s search is for diversity,\nas envisioned by Bakke, one benefit of which is its attendant mitigation of the\nclustering tendencies of the Top Ten Percent Plan.\n      Fisher responds that, even if necessary, UT Austin could never narrowly\ntailor a program that achieves classroom diversity.         In particular, Fisher\nsuggests that it is impossible to obtain classroom-level diversity without some\n                                        37\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085        Page: 38    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\nsort of fixed curriculum or lower school- or major-level standards.                This\nargument again misses the mark by defining diversity only by numbers. UT\nAustin does not suggest that the end point of this exercise is a specific measure\nof diversity in every class or every major. Instead, such measures are relevant\nbut not determinative signals of a want of the array of skills needed for\ndiversity. In other words, diversity in the student body surely produces a\ndegree of intra-classroom and intra-major diversity, with the “important and\nlaudable” benefit recognized in Grutter of “classroom discussion [being] livelier,\nmore spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting when the\nstudents have the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.” 132 When the\nholistic review program was modified to be race-conscious, 90% of classes had\none or zero African-American students, 46% had one or zero Asian-American\nstudents, and 43% had one or zero Hispanic students. 133 This represented a\ndecreasing degree of minority classroom dispersion since the adoption of the\nTop Ten Percent Plan.         This does not mean that there will be some set\npercentage of African-American nuclear physics majors. But this does mean\nthat UT Austin’s effort to ensure that African-American students with a broad\narray of skills are in the mix is both permissible and necessary.\n                                          VII\n      Interlacing the Top Ten Percent Plan, with its dependence upon\nsegregated schools to produce minority enrollment, with a plan that did not\nconsider race until it had a universe of applicants clearing a high hurdle of\ndemonstrated scholastic performance strongly supports UT Austin’s assertion\nthat its packaging of the two was necessary in its pursuit of diversity.

This\ncontention views minorities as a group, abjuring the focus upon individuals—\neach person’s unique potential. Race is relevant to minority and non-minority,\nnotably when candidates have flourished as a minority in their school—\nwhether they are white or black. Grutter reaffirmed that “[j]ust as growing up\nin a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to\naffect an individual’s views, so too is one’s own, unique experience of being a\nracial minority in a society, like our own, in which race still matters.” We are\npersuaded that to deny UT Austin its limited use of race in its search for\nholistic diversity would hobble the richness of the educational experience in\ncontradiction of the plain teachings of Bakke and Grutter. The need for such\nskill sets to complement the draws from majority-white and majority-minority\nschools flows directly from an understanding of what the Court has made plain\ndiversity is not. To conclude otherwise is to narrow its focus to a tally of skin\ncolors produced in defiance of Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court which\neschewed the narrow metric of numbers and turned the focus upon individuals.\nThis powerful charge does not deny the relevance of race. We find force in the\nargument that race here is a necessary part, albeit one of many parts, of the\ndecisional matrix where being white in a minority-majority school can set one\napart just as being a minority in a majority-white school—not a proffer of\nsocietal discrimination in justification for use of race, but a search for students\nwith a range of skills, experiences, and performances—one that will be\nimpaired by turning a blind eye to the differing opportunities offered by the\nschools from whence they came.\n                                        40\n\f   Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085      Page: 41   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n      It is settled that instruments of state may pursue facially neutral policies\ncalculated to promote equality of opportunity among students to whom the\npublic schools of Texas assign quite different starting places in the annual race\nfor seats in its flagship university. It is equally settled that universities may\nuse race as part of a holistic admissions program where it cannot otherwise\nachieve diversity. This interest is compelled by the reality that university\neducation is more the shaping of lives than the filling of heads with facts—the\nclassic assertion of the humanities.     Yet the backdrop of our efforts here\nincludes the reality that accepting as permissible policies whose purpose is to\nachieve a desired racial effect taxes the line between quotas and holistic use of\nrace towards a critical mass. We have hewed this line here, persuaded by UT\nAustin from this record of its necessary use of race in a holistic process and the\nwant of workable alternatives that would not require even greater use of race,\nfaithful to the content given to it by the Supreme Court.

This deference is squarely at odds with the central lesson of Fisher. A\nproper strict scrutiny analysis, affording the University “no deference” on its\nnarrow tailoring claims, compels the conclusion that the University’s race-\nconscious admissions process does not survive strict scrutiny.\n                                        I\n      As a preliminary matter, Fisher has standing to pursue this appeal, but\nnot because, as the majority contends, the Supreme Court’s opinion does “not\nallow our reconsideration [of the issue of standing].” Ante, at 6.\n      Federal courts have an affirmative duty to verify jurisdiction before\nproceeding to the merits.

See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 91.\nAccordingly, the issue of standing remains open, and this court is obliged to\naddress it. Id. at 94–95.\n      In our previous opinion, we held that Fisher had standing to “challenge\n[her] rejection and to seek money damages for [her] injury.” Fisher, 631 F.3d\nat 217. Only one relevant fact has changed since then—in 2012, Fisher\ngraduated from Louisiana State University. The University contends that by\ngraduating, “her forward-looking request for relief became moot” because she\ncould no longer seek reconsideration of her undergraduate application. Fisher’s\ngraduation does not alter our previous standing analysis because, as she\ncorrectly observes, that determination did not depend on a claim for forward-\nlooking injunctive relief. Id. We held that Fisher had standing to seek nominal\nmonetary damages, and we should reach the same conclusion now.\n      The University relies on Texas v. Lesage, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1854808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1854808/texas-v-lesage/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999) (per curiam),\nfor the proposition that Fisher lacks standing because she would not have been\nadmitted regardless of her race. But even if Lesage is a standing case (which is\na debatable premise—the case seems to address statutory liability under §\n1983), it does not affect the outcome here. Lesage stands for the proposition\nthat a plaintiff challenging governmental use of racial classifications cannot\nprevail if “it is undisputed that the government would have made the same\ndecision regardless” of such use. Id. at 21 (emphasis added). The University\nasserts that Fisher would not have been admitted even if she had a “perfect”\nPAI score. The majority agrees.

Rather, as Fisher explains, the proper question\nis whether she would have fallen above the admissions cut-off line if that line\nhad been drawn on a race-neutral distribution of all applicants’ scores. This\nrecord does not indicate whether Fisher would have been admitted if race were\nremoved from the admissions process altogether. At the least, this is a complex\nquestion that is far from “undisputed.” See Lesage, 528 U.S. at 21. Even the\nUniversity acknowledges that the answer to this question is practically\nunknowable: It concedes that re-engineering the 2008 admissions process by\nretroactively removing consideration of race is virtually impossible since race\nhas an immeasurable, yet potentially material, impact on the placement of the\nfinal admissions cut-off lines for all programs. In sum, the record does not show\nthat   Fisher’s    rejection   under    a   race-neutral     admissions      process    is\n“undisputed,” and remanding to the district court could not alter the record in\nthis regard.\n       The University further challenges Fisher’s standing on redressability\ngrounds. The University’s theory is that even if Fisher had been admitted\nthrough the race-conscious admissions program, and had not suffered the\ninjury of rejection, she still would have paid the non-refundable application fee.\nThus, says the University, because the application fee has no causal link to her\ninjury, any judicial relief would fail to provide redress. This argument\nmisconstrues the nature of Fisher’s alleged injury—it is not her rejection, but\nthe denial of equal protection of the laws during the admissions decision\nprocess.

See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 326. It is well-established that\nthere is a compelling governmental interest in obtaining the educational\nbenefits of a diverse student body.

See Fisher, 133 S.

Thus,\ndiversity cannot be defined by a “specified percentage of a particular group,”\nid. at 307, because such a definition would be “patently unconstitutional racial\nbalancing,” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330. In applying strict scrutiny, it is proper\nfor courts to defer to a university’s decision to pursue the compelling\ngovernmental interest of diversity based on its “educational judgment that\n\n\n\n       4 These principles are not challenged in this case. See infra note 8. However, I continue\nto believe that Grutter’s discussion of the “educational benefits of diversity,” drawing directly\nfrom the principles established in Bakke, “remains suspended at the highest levels of\nhypothesis and speculation,” Fisher, 631 F.3d at 255 (Garza, J., specially concurring).\n                                                  48\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085     Page: 49    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\nsuch diversity is essential to its educational mission.” Id. at 328. But, deference\nto the University is appropriate on this point, and this point alone. Fisher, 133\nS. Ct. at 2421.\n      Once a university has decided to pursue this compelling governmental\ninterest, it must prove that the means chosen “to attain diversity are narrowly\ntailored to that goal.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420. In this, the strict scrutiny test\ntakes the familiar form of a “means-to-ends” analysis: The compelling\ngovernmental interest is the ends, and the government program or law—here,\nthe University’s race-conscious admissions program—is the means. Strict\nscrutiny places the burden of proving narrow tailoring firmly with the\ngovernment. See Johnson v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (2005). And,\nfurthermore, narrow tailoring must be established “with clarity.” Fisher, 133\nS. Ct. at 2418.\n      Before this case, the Supreme Court had issued only three major\ndecisions addressing affirmative action in higher education admissions: Bakke,\nGratz, and Grutter. In Fisher, the Court made clear that this line of cases does\nnot stand apart from “broader equal protection jurisprudence.” Id. at 2418.\nRather, “the analysis and level of scrutiny applied to determine the validity of\n[a racial classification] do not vary simply because the objective appears\nacceptable . . . .” Id. at 2421 (quoting Miss.

While the overarching\nprinciples from Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter—that a university can have a\ncompelling interest in attaining the educational benefits of diversity, and that\nits admissions program must be narrowly tailored to serve this interest—were\ntaken “as given,” id. at 2417–18, the Fisher Court altered the application of\nthose principles in a critical way. Now, courts must give “no deference,” to a\n\n                                            49\n\f    Case: 09-50822         Document: 00512699085           Page: 50      Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                             No. 09-50822\n\nstate actor’s assertion that its chosen “means . . . to attain diversity are\nnarrowly tailored to that goal.” Id. at 2420. In so doing, the Fisher Court\nembraced Justice Kennedy’s position on “deference” from Grutter. 5 Thus, under\nthe current principles governing review of race-conscious admissions\nprograms, providing any deference to a state actor’s claim that its use of race\nis narrowly tailored is “antithetical to strict scrutiny, not consistent with it.”\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 394 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\n       Because the higher-education affirmative action cases do not stand apart\nfrom “broader equal protection jurisprudence,” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2418, strict\nscrutiny must be applied with the same analytical rigor deployed in those other\ncontexts. Put simply, there is no special form of strict scrutiny unique to higher\neducation admissions decisions. Accordingly, we must now evaluate narrow\ntailoring by ensuring that “the means chosen ‘fit’ the [compelling governmental\ninterest] so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the\nclassification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.” Croson, 488 U.S.\nat 493. 6 Narrow tailoring further requires that “the reviewing court verify that\nit is necessary for a university to use race to achieve the educational benefits\n\n\n\n       5  See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“[T]he majority proceeds to\nnullify . . . rigorous judicial review, with strict scrutiny as the controlling standard . . . . The\nCourt confuses deference to a university’s definition of its educational objective with\ndeference to the implementation of this goal.”). I agree with the majority that Fisher\nrepresents a decisive shift in the law. See ante, at 10 (“Bringing forward Justice Kennedy’s\ndissent in Grutter, the Supreme Court faulted the district court’s and this Court’s review of\nUT Austin’s means to achieve the permissible goal of diversity . . . .”); see also Erwin\nChemerinsky, The Court Affects Each of Us, 16 Green Bag 2d 361, 364 (2013) (“[Fisher] adopts\na tougher, less sympathetic tone when it comes to affirmative action programs. For example,\nin Grutter, the Court spoke of the need to defer to the judgment of colleges and universities.\nIn Fisher, the Court said that such deference was appropriate only as to the importance of\ndiversity; there is no deference given as to whether race is necessary to achieve it.”).\n\n       6 We need not determine whether the “strong basis in evidence” test from Croson\napplies in this case. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 510. Even without this test, the University fails\nto carry its strict scrutiny burden of proving that its race-conscious admissions policy is\nnecessary to further its diversity interest.\n                                                    50\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085         Page: 51     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nof diversity.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420 (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). To do so, we must carefully inquire into whether the University\n“could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.” Id.\nEstablishing narrow tailoring does not require the University to show that it\nexhausted every possible race-neutral option, but it must meet its “ultimate\nburden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that\navailable, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.” Id.\n       Of course, all of the above must be underscored by the principle that\nusing racial classifications is permissible only as a “last resort to achieve a\ncompelling interest.” Parents Involved in Cmty.

To uphold the use of race under strict scrutiny, courts must\nfind narrow tailoring through a close “fit” between this goal and the admissions\nprogram’s consideration of race. 8 Accordingly, the controlling question becomes\nthe definition of “critical mass”—the University’s stated goal. In order for us to\ndetermine whether its use of racial classifications in the admissions program\nis narrowly tailored to its goal, the University must explain its goal, and do so\n“with clarity.” Fisher, 133 S.

Ct. at 2419 (“[T]he\nparties here do not ask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter’s holding.”). Our only\nconcern is whether the University’s means—its race-conscious holistic admissions program—\nare narrowly tailored to its diversity objective.\n\n                                                  51\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085      Page: 52    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\n      The majority entirely overlooks the University’s failure to define its\n“critical mass” objective for the purposes of assessing narrow tailoring. This is\nthe crux of this case—absent a meaningful explanation of its desired ends, the\nUniversity cannot prove narrow tailoring under its strict scrutiny burden.\nIndeed, the majority repeatedly invokes the term “critical mass” without even\nquestioning its definition. See, e.g., ante, at 23 (“But minority representation\nthen remained largely stagnant, within a narrow oscillating band, rather than\nmoving towards a critical mass of minority students.”); id. at 30 (“Achieving\nthe critical mass requisite to diversity goes astray when it drifts to numerical\nmetrics.”); id. (“Fisher refuses to acknowledge this distinction between critical\nmass—the tipping point of diversity—and a quota.”); id. at 34 (“Critical mass,\nthe tipping point of diversity, has no fixed upper bound of universal\napplication, nor is it the minimum threshold at which minority students do not\nfeel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.”). Under Fisher, it is not\nenough for a court to simply state, as does the majority, that it is not deferring\nto the University’s narrow tailoring arguments. See, e.g., id., at 17 (“Affording\nno deference, we look for narrow tailoring . . . .”). Rather, the reviewing court’s\nactual analysis must demonstrate that “no deference” has been afforded.\nFisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420. Here, the majority’s failure to make a meaningful\ninquiry into the nature of “critical mass” constitutes precisely such deference.\n      Certainly, as explained below, I agree that “critical mass” does not\nrequire a precise numerical definition. See infra note 11. But, to meet its\nnarrow tailoring burden, the University must explain its goal to us in some\nmeaningful way. We cannot undertake a rigorous ends-to-means narrow\ntailoring analysis when the University will not define the ends. We cannot tell\nwhether the admissions program closely “fits” the University’s goal when it\nfails to objectively articulate its goal. Nor can we determine whether\nconsidering race is necessary for the University to achieve “critical mass,” or\n\n                                           52\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085           Page: 53     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                            No. 09-50822\n\nwhether there are effective race-neutral alternatives, when it has not described\nwhat “critical mass” requires. 9\n        At best, the University’s attempted articulations of “critical mass”\nbefore this court are subjective, circular, or tautological. See infra Part III.A.\nThe University explains only that its “concept of critical mass is defined by\nreference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.”\nAnd, in attempting to address when it is likely to achieve critical mass, the\nUniversity explains only that it will “cease its consideration of race when it\ndetermines . . . that the educational benefits of diversity can be achieved at UT\nthrough a race-neutral policy . . . .” These articulations are insufficient. Under\nthe rigors of strict scrutiny, the judiciary must “verify that it is necessary for a\nuniversity to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.” Fisher,\n133 S. Ct. at 2420 (internal quotations omitted). It is not possible to perform\nthis function when the University’s objective is unknown, unmeasurable, or\nunclear.\n       The exacting scrutiny required by the Supreme Court’s “broader equal\nprotection jurisprudence” is entirely absent from today’s opinion, which holds\nthat the University has proven narrow tailoring even though it has failed to\nmeaningfully articulate its diversity goals.\n\n\n       9   There is some dispute about whether the University’s definition of “critical mass” is\neven before us as part of our narrow tailoring analysis. The University claims that this issue\nis outside the scope of the Supreme Court’s remand because it is relevant only to its\ncompelling interest in diversity. This contention misunderstands the way in which “critical\nmass” matters to this case. Here, “critical mass” represents the goal the University purports\nto seek. The University uses this term as a representation of its ends. Fisher clearly\nestablishes that reviewing courts must defer to the University’s decision to pursue such ends.\n133 S. Ct. at 2419. But, it equally establishes that we cannot defer to the University’s claim\nthat “the means chosen . . . to attain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.” Id. at 2420.\nTo conduct our own independent assessment of narrow tailoring—the judicial role under\nstrict scrutiny—we must have a clear and definite understanding of the goal the University\nactually seeks. Accordingly, we must question the University’s explanation of “critical mass”\nto fulfill the task remanded to us by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                                   53\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085         Page: 54     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\n                                             A\n       The University’s failure to define meaningfully its “critical mass”\nobjective is manifest in its various strict scrutiny arguments.

The University “based its critical mass\ndetermination on several data points, including hard data on minority\nadmissions, enrollment, and racial isolation” and found that its use of racial\nclassifications “does increase minority enrollment.” 11 Accepting that such\nmetrics bear some relevance to the University’s progress, this is insufficient to\nsatisfy strict scrutiny.

Fisher effectively asks us to ratify racial quotas, which we cannot, and will\nnot, do. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317–18 (disapproving quota systems and approving the use of\nrace or ethnic background as a “plus” factor).\n\n                                                 54\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 55     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nsmall number of minority applicants under the race-conscious admissions plan\nis necessary to advancing its diversity goal.\n       It is undeniable that the University admits only a small number of\nminority students under race-conscious holistic review.

Even if we assume that all minority students who were\nadmitted and enrolled in that year through the race-conscious holistic review\nprocess gained admission because of their race, this number is strikingly\nsmall—only 216 African-American and Hispanic students in an entering class\nof 6,322. 12 The University fails to explain how this small group contributes to\nits “critical mass” objective. “Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to\npermit any but the most exact connection between justification and [racial]\nclassification.” Adarand, 515 U.S. at 236 (emphasis added). But here, the\nUniversity has not established a clear and definite connection between its\nchosen means and its desired ends of “critical mass.”\n       To be clear, I agree that a race-conscious admissions plan need not have\na “dramatic or lopsided impact” on minority enrollment numbers to survive\nstrict scrutiny, as the University reads Fisher’s arguments to suggest. But\nneither can the University prove the necessity of its racial classification\nwithout meaningfully explaining how a small, marginal increase in minority\nadmissions is necessary to achieving its diversity goals. Thus, neither the small\n\n\n       12  Notwithstanding the University’s contention that 2008 witnessed an\n“unprecedented surge” in Top Ten Percent Law admissions, this is the only relevant year for\npurposes of our narrow tailoring analysis. Moreover, I continue to find the majority’s use of\ndata for both enrolled and admitted students to be misguided and potentially confusing. See\nante, at 35–37. In my view, the proper metric is enrolled students because we are assessing\nwhether the University’s means are narrowly tailored to its goal of attaining “the educational\nbenefits of diversity” on campus. See Fisher, 631 F.3d at 260 n.18 (Garza, J., specially\nconcurring).\n\n                                                 55\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085         Page: 56    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\n(and decreasing) percentage of minority holistic-review admittees, nor\nminorities’ “under-representation” in holistic review admissions relative to\nwhites, taken alone, demonstrates narrow tailoring. See ante, at 17–18 &\nAppendix 1 (explaining that white students comprise a larger percentage of\nholistic review admittees than of the incoming class as a whole). 13\n      Under the Equal Protection Clause, diversity cannot be assessed by\nstrictly quantitative metrics, and, to the extent that numbers could be relevant\nin assessing “critical mass,” the University leaves this relevance entirely\nunexplained.\n                                            2\n      The University advances a second understanding of “critical mass,”\nwhich I will refer to as “qualitative.” Under this theory, the University says its\ngoal is not boosting minority enrollment numbers alone, but rather promoting\nthe quality of minority enrollment—in short, diversity within diversity. The\nUniversity submits that its race-conscious holistic review allows it to select for\n“other types of diversity” beyond race alone, and to identify the most “talented,\nacademically promising, and well-rounded” minority students. According to\nthe University, these are crucial “change agents” who debunk stereotypes but\nwho may fall outside the top 10% of their high school classes.\n      As a preliminary matter, these stated ends are too imprecise to permit\nthe requisite strict scrutiny analysis. The University has not provided any\nconcrete targets for admitting more minority students possessing these unique\nqualitative-diversity characteristics—that is, the “other types of diversity”\nbeyond race alone. At what point would this qualitative diversity target be\n\n\n\n\n      13For example, for the incoming class that enrolled in 2008, white students comprised\n65% of all students admitted through holistic review, but only 52% of the entire incoming\nclass.\n                                                56\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 57     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\nachieved? Because its ends are unknown to us, the University cannot meet its\nstrict scrutiny burden.\n       But, even accepting the University’s broad and generic qualitative\ndiversity ends, we cannot conclude that the race-conscious policy is\nconstitutionally “necessary.” The University has not shown that qualitative\ndiversity is absent among the minority students admitted under the race-\nneutral Top Ten Percent Law, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 51.803 (West 2009). That\nis, the University does not evaluate the diversity present in this group before\ndeploying racial classifications to fill the remaining seats. The University does\nnot assess whether Top Ten Percent Law admittees exhibit sufficient diversity\nwithin diversity, whether the requisite “change agents” are among them, and\nwhether these admittees are able, collectively or individually, to combat\npernicious stereotypes. There is no such evaluation despite the fact that Top\nTen Percent Law admittees also submit applications with essays, and are even\nassigned PAI scores for purposes of admission to individual schools. 14\nEvaluating the composition of these admittees—80% of the class in 2008—\nbefore deploying racial classifications in the holistic admissions program might\nwell reveal that racial classifications are not necessary to achieve the\nUniversity’s qualitative diversity goals. See Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420; see also\nParents Involved, 551 U.S. at 790 (explaining that racial classifications must\nbe a “last resort to achieve a compelling interest” in order to survive strict\nscrutiny) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n       In effect, the University asks this Court to assume that minorities\nadmitted under the Top Ten Percent Law do not demonstrate “diversity within\n\n\n       14 Dr. Kedra Ishop, Associate Director of Admissions, explained that all applicant files\nare assigned an AI and PAI, and that the AI and PAI of a Top Ten Percent Law applicant can\nstill determine the program to which she is admitted, if her class rank is not high enough for\nautomatic admission to a competitive first-choice program such as the School of Business.\n\n                                                 57\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 58     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\ndiversity”—that they are somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and more\nundesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review. Thus, the\nUniversity claims, absent its race-conscious holistic admissions program, it\nwould lose the minority students necessary to achieving a qualitative critical\nmass. But it offers no evidence in the record to prove this, and we must\ntherefore refuse to make this assumption.\n       Regrettably, the majority firmly adopts this assumption—that minority\nstudents from majority-minority Texas high schools are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to contribute to the University’s vision of a diverse student body. 15\nThe majority reasons that race-conscious holistic review is a “necessary\ncomplement,” ante, at 30, to the Top Ten Percent Law, which, on its own, would\nadmit insufficient “students of unique talents and backgrounds who can enrich\nthe diversity of the student body in distinct ways,” id., at 29. The majority’s\ndiscussion of numerous “resegregated” Texas school districts is premised on\nthe dangerous assumption that students from those districts (at least those in\nthe top ten percent of each class) do not possess the qualities necessary for the\nUniversity of Texas to establish a meaningful campus diversity. See id., at 24–\n26. In this, it has embraced the very ill that the Equal Protection Clause seeks\nto banish. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 505 (“[R]acial characteristics so seldom\nprovide a relevant basis for disparate treatment.”); Fullilove, 448 U.S. at 523\n(“[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or\nethnic origin is inherently suspect.”) (Stewart, J., dissenting); Cayetano, 528\n\n\n       15 See ante, at 26 (discussing the “outcome gaps” of “segregated urban schools”); id. at\n26 (classifying schools according to their racial and ethnic compositions). Additionally, the\nmajority’s sua sponte survey of Texas school districts’ data on racial composition, test scores,\nand educational outcomes, id. at 26–28, ventures far beyond the summary judgment record.\nUnder strict scrutiny, the government bears the burden of establishing compliance with the\nConstitution. See Johnson, 543 U.S. at 505. More specifically, the Supreme Court’s opinion\nhas mandated that we decide whether “this record . . . is sufficient” to demonstrate narrow\ntailoring. Fisher, 133 S.

Ante, at 24–25 (“The de facto segregation of schools in Texas\nenables the Top Ten Percent Law to increase minorities in the mix, while\nignoring contributions to diversity beyond race.”). 16                   By accepting the\nUniversity’s standing presumption that minority students admitted under the\nTop Ten Percent Law do not possess the characteristics necessary to achieve a\ncampus environment defined by “qualitative diversity,” the majority engages\nin the very stereotyping that the Equal Protection Clause abhors. 17\n       The record does not indicate that the University evaluates students\nadmitted under the Top Ten Percent Law, checking for indicia of qualitative\ndiversity—diversity within diversity—before determining that race should be\nconsidered in the holistic review process to fill the remaining seats in the class.\nIf the Top Ten Percent Law admittees were a sufficiently qualitatively diverse\npopulation, which they may well be so far as I can tell, then using race in\nholistic review to promote further diversity might not be necessary for the\nUniversity to achieve its goal, and an up-front assessment of these admittees,\n\n\n\n       16 The majority’s reductionist assumption about the experiences of minority students\nadmitted under the Top Ten Percent Law is startling: “The top 29 graduates from Jack Yates\nHigh School in Houston live in the same predominately African-American neighborhood of\nthat city’s Third Ward, and thus likely experienced a similar cultural environment.” Ante, at\n24 n.98.\n\n       17 This stereotyping is not limited to minority students admitted under the Top Ten\nPercent Law. The majority further assumes that minority students admitted under holistic\nreview, based on their “experience of being a minority in a majority-white . . . school,” likely\n“demonstra[te] qualities of leadership and sense of self.” Ante, at 29. These conclusions are\nnonetheless stereotypes disallowed by the Fourteenth Amendment. And in any event, this\nrecord, by which we are bound, does not indicate that any minority students admitted under\nholistic review come from majority-white schools. See supra note 15.\n                                                  59\n\f    Case: 09-50822      Document: 00512699085             Page: 60     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nbefore turning to race, could be a more narrowly-tailored option. And, in any\nevent, the University offers no method for this court to determine when, if ever,\nits goal (which remains undefined) for qualitative diversity will be reached.\nAccordingly, the University has failed to carry its strict scrutiny burden of\nproving that its race-conscious admissions policy is necessary to achieving its\ndiversity objective of a “qualitative” critical mass.\n                                               3\n      In earlier stages of this case, the University framed its diversity goal as\nachieving “classroom diversity.” The University suggested that classroom\ndiversity and the distribution of minority students among colleges and majors\nwere meaningful metrics in determining whether “critical mass” had been\nattained. And, indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that increased\ndiversity of perspectives in the classroom provides for a “livelier, more spirited,\nand simply more enlightening and interesting” experience. Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 330 (quoting Bakke, 438, U.S. at 307). However, the University has\ndistanced itself from this previously asserted goal, now claiming it “has never\npursued classroom diversity as a discrete interest or endpoint,” but merely as\n“one of many factors” to be considered in evaluating diversity. Given the\nUniversity’s failure to press the classroom diversity argument in its briefing\non remand, the issue is almost certainly waived. See United States v. Griffith,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"59544\"><a href=\"/opinion/59544/united-states-v-griffith/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610 (5th Cir. 2008) (“It is a well-worn principle that the failure\nto raise an issue on appeal constitutes waiver of that argument.”).\n      Notwithstanding this waiver, the majority addresses the issue of\nclassroom     diversity,    contending        that      the   University’s   race-conscious\nadmissions policy is necessary to give “high-scoring minority students a better\nchance   of   gaining      admission     to    UT       Austin’s     competitive   academic\ndepartments.” Ante, at 37.

See United States v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (1996)\n(“The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in\nresponse to litigation.”). Rather, assuming that the University’s diversity goal\nis establishing classroom diversity, it is the University that bears the burden\nof proving that the use of race in calculating the PAI scores is necessary to\nfurthering this goal. But instead of explaining how race enhances minority\nstudents’ prospects of admission to a competitive college or major, the\nUniversity admissions officers’ deposition testimony specifically indicates that\nrace could not be a decisive factor in any applicant’s admission, 19 and that it is\nimpossible to determine whether race was in fact decisive for any particular\n\n\n       18  The record describes the admissions process as follows: First, the admissions staff\nread all applicants’ files, including those of Top Ten Percent Law applicants, and assign each\nan AI and PAI score. Applicants with exceptionally high class rank or AI scores are\nautomatically admitted to certain first-choice schools or majors and, thus, also to the\nUniversity. Next, for applicants not automatically admitted to their first choice, the staff\ngenerate a matrix for each school with each cell on the matrix representing an intersection\nof AI and PAI scores. Working with liaisons from each school, the staff plot the remaining\napplicants’ scores on matrices according to the applicants’ first-choice majors. Based on the\nnumber of applicants in each matrix cell and the available seats in the class for each school,\nthe admissions staff and liaisons draw “cut-off lines” across the matrices. Applicants not\nselected for admission to their first-choice school “cascade” onto the matrix for their second-\nchoice school, where they are added to the cells along with applicants who were above the\ncut-off line during the previous review round. The cut-off lines are readjusted to accommodate\nthe additional students, and those remaining above the adjusted cut-off lines are accepted to\nthat school. Applicants not admitted to either their first- or second-choice school then\n“cascade” into the Liberal Arts Undecided matrix, which serves as the default third-choice\nmajor. Again, the admissions staff perform the line-drawing exercise (cognizant that\nremaining Top Ten Percent Law applicants must be admitted as Liberal Arts majors, thus\nreducing the number of available spaces), and a final determination is made for all\napplicants.\n\n       19 When asked whether any one factor in the PAI calculation could be determinative\nfor an applicant’s admission, Dr. Bruce Walker, Vice Provost and Director of Admissions,\nstated “no.”\n\n                                                 61\n\f    Case: 09-50822       Document: 00512699085          Page: 62     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\napplicant’s admission decision. 20 Absent any record evidence of the potential\nfor race to be a decisive factor, the University cannot establish, as the majority\nclaims, that its racial classifications could actually give any minority applicant\n“a better chance” of admission to a competitive college. Ante, at 37.\n        In short, the University has obscured its use of race to the point that\neven its own officers cannot explain the impact of race on admission to\ncompetitive colleges. 21 If race is indeed without a discernable impact, the\nUniversity cannot carry its burden of proving that race-conscious holistic\nreview is necessary to achieving classroom diversity (or, for that matter, any\nkind of diversity). Because the role played by race in the admissions decision\nis essentially unknowable, I cannot find that these racial classifications are\nnecessary or narrowly tailored to achieving the University’s interest in\ndiversity.\n                                              4\n       The University further claims that its race-conscious admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored because, with the help of a rigorous periodic\nreview system, it will “cease its consideration of race when it determines . . .\nthat the educational benefits of diversity can be achieved at [the University]\n\n\n\n       20Dr. Kedra Ishop was asked whether she could give an “example where race would\nhave some impact on an applicant’s personal achievement score?” Her answer: “In order to–\nit’s impossible to say–to give you an example of a particular student because it’s all\ncontextual.”\n\n       21 And race is entirely invisible at the moment of drawing the final admission cut-off\nlines, for students not automatically admitted to their first-choice program by virtue of an\nexceptionally high class rank or AI score. The University’s admissions staff and liaisons from\neach school admit students to the various schools and majors based solely on the combination\nof applicants’ AI and PAI scores. While race is considered in determining PAI scores, once\nthe scores are assigned and applicants are plotted on the matrices for the various schools,\nadmissions officers treat applicants as points on a grid. In other words, the University\nofficials have no way of knowing whether they are selecting applicants whose race\nincrementally boosted their PAI score, much less whether any particular applicant will help\nthe University improve classroom diversity.\n                                                  62\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085      Page: 63    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\nthrough a race-neutral policy ‘at reasonable cost’ to its other educational\nobjectives.” The University seeks to assure us that periodic review of its\nadmissions policy considers enrollment data, “evidence of racial isolation and\nthe racial climate on campus,” and “other data including the educational\nbenefits of diversity experienced in the classroom.” In simple language, the\nUniversity asserts that it knows critical mass when it sees it.\n      On one level, the University’s review process captures the essence of the\nholistic diversity interest established in Bakke, validated in Grutter, and left\nintact by Fisher. See Ante at 12 (“Diversity is a composite of the backgrounds,\nexperiences, achievements, and hardships of students to which race only\ncontributes.”). In fact, the Grutter Court discussed the important role that such\nreviews can play in determining whether racial classifications have continuing\nnecessity under strict scrutiny. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342.\n      Nonetheless, there are two distinct flaws with the University’s\nassurances that its own, internal, periodic review is sufficient to safeguard\nagainst any unconstitutional use of race. First, strict scrutiny does not allow\nthe judiciary to delegate wholesale to state actors the task of determining\nwhether a race-conscious admissions policy continues to be necessary. This is\nthe very point made by the Fisher Court, in vacating our previous opinion for\ndeferring to the University’s narrow-tailoring claims. Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at\n2420–21.\n      Second, while the University correctly considers a range of factors in its\nassessment of the necessity of its use of race, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315\n(describing diversity as a “broader array of qualifications and characteristics”\nof which race is only one), it has still not explained to us how this consideration\ntakes place. In describing its periodic review process, the University never\nexplains how the various factors are measured, the weight afforded to each,\n\n\n                                           63\n\f    Case: 09-50822         Document: 00512699085        Page: 64     Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nand what combination thereof would yield a “critical mass” of diversity\nsufficient to cease use of racial classifications.\n        In light of this, I cannot determine that the race-conscious admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored to the University’s goal. The University, in effect,\ndefines critical mass as a nebulous amalgam of factors—enrollment data,\nracial isolation, racial climate, and “the educational benefits of diversity”—that\nits internal periodic review is calibrated to detect. But, without more, the\nUniversity fails to prove narrow tailoring with clarity. Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at\n2418.        Such a bare submission, in essence, begs for the deference that is\nirreconcilable with “meaningful” judicial review. Id. at 2421.\n                                              5\n        Lastly, the University submits that its race-conscious admissions policy\nnecessarily satisfies narrow tailoring because it is closely modeled on the\nadmissions program upheld by the Supreme Court in Grutter. Similarly, the\nmajority implies that the race-conscious admissions policy’s similarity to\nGrutter is, itself, a meaningful factor in our strict scrutiny analysis. 22 This\nclaim is unpersuasive.\n        Fisher confirms that we are obligated to consider the particular\nchallenged race-conscious program on its own terms and ask whether the\nUniversity        “could   achieve   sufficient    diversity     without     using     racial\nclassifications.” 133 S. Ct. at 2420. Strict scrutiny is not a hypothetical\nundertaking, but rather “imposes on the university the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available,\nworkable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n         See ante, at 16 (describing the University’s use of race with direct reference to the\n        22\n\nprogram approved in Grutter); id. at 29 (“UT Austin’s holistic review program—a program\nnearly indistinguishable from the University of Michigan Law School’s program in Grutter .\n. . .”).\n                                                  64\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085          Page: 65      Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\n       Certain aspects of the University’s admissions policy do parallel the\nfeatures of the plan upheld in Grutter—race is only a sub-factor within a\nholistic, individualized review process, and the University’s goal is framed in\nterms of “critical mass.” But the University, under mandate by the Texas\nLegislature’s Top Ten Percent Law, admits the majority of its entering class\nthrough a separate, race-neutral scheme. 23 This inevitably impacts the narrow\ntailoring calculus presently under consideration. That is, while the\nUniversity’s race-conscious admissions policy is conceptually derived from the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School’s approach, the two are quite distinct in\npractice: The University’s holistic review coexists with a separate process that\nadmits a large population of students, a circumstance not contemplated in\nGrutter. 24\n       Similarity to Grutter is not a narrow-tailoring talisman that insulates\nthe University’s policy from strict scrutiny. The University’s burden is to prove\nthat its own use of racial classifications is necessary and narrowly tailored for\nachieving its own diversity objectives.\n\n\n\n\n       23    The majority implies that the University’s implementation of the Top Ten Percent\nLaw was discretionary. See ante, at 15 (“UT Austin turned to the Top Ten Percent Plan\n . . . .” (emphasis added)); id. at 16 (“We are offered no coherent response to the validity of a\npotentially different election by UT Austin: to invert the process and use Grutter’s holistic\nreview to select 80% or all of its students.” (emphasis added)). There was no such choice; the\nUniversity was mandated by the law to admit any graduate in the top ten percent of his or\nher high school class. And, as explained below, the Top Ten Percent Law is not challenged in\nthis appeal.\n\n        24 Additionally, I observe that the admissions program here and that in Grutter do not\n\nseem to use race in the same way. Even accepting that the University uses race as a “factor\nof a factor of a factor,” here, the University incorporates race into the PAI before individual\nadmissions decisions are made on the matrices, at which point race is invisible. See supra\nnote 21. By contrast, in Grutter, each law school applicant’s file, including his or her racial\nclassification, was considered during a holistic, full-file review. See 539 U.S. at 334–36.\n\n                                                  65\n\f    Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085        Page: 66   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\n                                          B\n      Ultimately, the record is devoid of any specifically articulated connection\nbetween the University’s diversity goal of “critical mass” and its race-conscious\nadmissions process. The University has not shown how it determines the\nexistence, or lack, of a “critical mass” of diversity in its student population.\nRather, the University only frames its goal as “obtaining the educational\nbenefits of diversity.” This is entirely circular reasoning that cannot satisfy\nthe rigorous means-to-ends analysis required under strict scrutiny. Fisher, 133\nS. Ct. at 2421.\n      To be clear, my concern is not with the University’s use of the term\n“critical mass” itself. Even if the University were to adopt another rhetorical\nconstruct to explain its diversity objectives, it faces the same underlying\nproblem—it does not offer a clear and definite articulation of its goal sufficient\nfor a reviewing court to verify narrow tailoring. The University’s failure to\nmeet its strict scrutiny burden is a function of its undefined ends, not its choice\nto label those ends as “critical mass.”\n                                          IV\n      The majority concludes that the University’s race-conscious admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored because the University has exhausted all\nworkable alternatives. Ante, at 41.       Much of today’s opinion explores the\nhistorical “narrative” of the University’s admissions process, including many\nrace-neutral recruitment programs intended to bolster minority enrollment.\nId. at 15. And, indeed, the University’s many efforts to achieve a diverse\ncampus learning environment without resorting to racial classifications are\ncommendable. But, framing this history as something akin to a process of\nelimination, the majority finds that the University’s race-conscious admissions\nprogram must be necessary and narrowly tailored to the University’s diversity\nobjectives. This is insufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.\n\n                                               66\n\f   Case: 09-50822     Document: 00512699085      Page: 67    Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\n\n      Certainly, the University’s past experiences with race-neutral initiatives\nare relevant to the inquiry because the University must establish that “no\nworkable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of\ndiversity,” and because the University’s “experience and expertise” provide\nsome context to inform judicial review. Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2420. However,\nwe cannot conclude that the University’s current race-conscious admissions\nprogram—the only matter before this court—is narrowly tailored to achieve\nthe educational benefits of diversity because the University has failed to define\nwhat it means by “critical mass.” In other words, the University’s long history\nof purportedly unsuccessful alternatives is meaningless if we cannot discern\nthe contours of the success it now seeks.\n      Additionally, the majority’s sustained focus on the Top Ten Percent Law\nis misplaced. While the Law is indeed central to this case, here, as in our\nprevious consideration of this appeal, “[n]o party challenged, in the district\ncourt or in this court, the validity or the wisdom of the Top Ten Percent Law.”\nFisher, 631 F.3d at 247 (King, J., specially concurring). Nevertheless, the\nmajority forcefully indicts the Law for frustrating the University’s efforts to\nachieve well-rounded diversity. In the majority’s view, the Law’s shortcomings\nmake a holistic review program more necessary.              Ante, at 30 (“We are\npersuaded that holistic review is a necessary complement to the Top Ten\nPercent Plan, enabling it to operate without reducing itself to a cover for a\nquota system . . . .”). At most, the Law’s mechanical operation—admitting\nstudents based on the sole metric of high school class rank—might suggest that\nsome form of holistic review is advisable to supplement the admissions process.\nBut this issue is not before us at all. Our task is to determine whether the\nUniversity’s injection of race into its admissions process survives strict\nscrutiny.\n\n\n                                            67\n\f    Case: 09-50822        Document: 00512699085             Page: 68   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                           No. 09-50822\n\n       The Top Ten Percent Law matters only insofar as it causes the\nUniversity to admit a large number of minority students separate and apart\nfrom the holistic review process. That is, the Law creates a separate\nadmissions channel for many minority students, which then calls into question\nthe necessity of using race as a factor in the holistic review process for filling\nthe remaining seats. Whether, in light of the Top Ten Percent Law, race-\nconscious holistic review is more or less necessary is an open question, and it\nis the University that bears the burden of explaining how the Law impacts its\nachievement of its diversity goal. Here, it has failed to do so, under any theory\nof “critical mass” it has proffered. 25\n                                       *       *        *\n       The material facts of this case have remained unchanged since the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment, but the governing law has changed\nmarkedly. Fisher established that strict scrutiny in the higher education\naffirmative action setting is no different than strict scrutiny in other equal\nprotection contexts—the state actor receives no deference in proving that its\nchosen race-conscious means are narrowly tailored to its ends. The majority\nfails to give Fisher its proper weight. Today’s opinion sidesteps the new strict\nscrutiny standard and continues to defer to the University’s claims that its use\nof racial classifications is narrowly tailored to its diversity goal. Because the\n\n\n       25 There are additional elements of the majority’s discussion of the Top Ten Percent\nLaw that I cannot join. First, to bolster the “necessity” of race-conscious holistic review, the\nmajority explains that holistic-review admittees have higher standardized test scores. Ante,\nat 24 & nn. 96–97. However, no testimony or record evidence establishes whether the gap in\nSAT scores between Top Ten Percent and Non-Top Ten Percent admittees is statistically\nsignificant. And as the University’s president explained in 2000, “top 10 percent high school\nstudents make much higher grades in college than non-top 10 percent students,” and\n“[s]trong academic performance in high school is an even better predictor of success in college\nthan standardized test scores.” At best, the academic superiority of holistic review admittees\nas a group is highly contested. Second, legislative changes to the Top Ten Percent Law after\n2008, the relevant year for our purposes, are not germane to our analysis. See ante, at 32\n(discussing S.B. 175).\n                                                   68\n\f    Case: 09-50822    Document: 00512699085       Page: 69   Date Filed: 07/15/2014\n\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\nUniversity has not defined its diversity goal in any meaningful way—instead,\nreflexively reciting the term “critical mass”—it is altogether impossible to\ndetermine whether its use of racial classifications is narrowly tailored.\n      This is not to say, however, that it is impossible for a public university\nto define its diversity ends adequately for a court to verify narrow tailoring\nwith the requisite exacting scrutiny. After all, “[s]trict scrutiny must not be\nstrict in theory but fatal in fact.” Fisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2421 (internal quotations\nomitted). It may even be possible for a university to do so while seeking a\n“critical mass.” What matters now, after Fisher, is that a state actor’s diversity\ngoals must be sufficiently clear and definite such that a reviewing court can\nassess, without deference, whether its particular use of racial classifications is\nnecessary and narrowly tailored to those goals. On this record, the University\nhas not “offered sufficient evidence that would prove that its admissions\nprogram is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”\nFisher, 133 S. Ct. at 2421. Accordingly, I would reverse and render judgment\nfor Fisher.\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                           69\n\f</pre>",
