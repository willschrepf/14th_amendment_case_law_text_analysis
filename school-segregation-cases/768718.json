WEICK, Circuit Judge (pp. 259-274) and MILLER, Circuit Judge (pp. 283, 284) filed dissenting opinions and KENT, Circuit Judge (pp. 274-283) filed a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.

The earlier decisions of this court are reported at Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897 (6 Cir. 1970); Bradley v. Milliken, 438 F.2d 945 (6 Cir. 1971); and Bradley v. Milliken, 6 Cir., 468 F.2d 902. cert. denied, 409 U.S. 844, 93 S.Ct. 45, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972).  (On November 27, 1972, the original panel dismissed for want of jurisdiction an \"emergency motion\" by the Detroit Board of Education that State officials be required to provide funds to keep the Detroit public schools operating for 180 regular days of instruction during the current school year.)  On February 27, 1973, the Supreme Court denied review in Bloomfield Hills School District v. Roth, West Bloomfield School District v. Roth, and Birmingham School District v. Roth, 410 U.S. 954, 93 S.Ct. 1418, 35 L.Ed. 2d 687.  In these cases this court had denied applications for writs of mandamus or prohibition against District Judge Roth.  The School Districts contended that the District Judge usurped jurisdiction by failing to convene three-judge courts and by subjecting the Schools Districts to his ruling and order in the school desegregation case in spite of the fact that the Districts were not parties to the desegregation proceedings and had not been found to have committed any act of de jure segregation.  The action of the Supreme Court was without prejudice to the right of the School Districts to file application to intervene in the present action.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oral arguments were heard before a panel of this court on August 24, 1972.  An opinion was announced by the panel on December 8, 1972, affirming two orders of the District Court, viz: (1) Ruling on Issue of Segregation, reported at 338 F.Supp. 582, and (2) Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on \"Detroit only\" plans of desegregation, dated March 28, 1972.  The decision of the panel vacated the remaining three orders on appeal (enumerated below), but affirmed in principle the ruling of the District Court on the propriety of a metropolitan remedy to accomplish desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 1973, this court granted rehearing in banc.  Under the provisions of Rule 3(b) of the local rules of this court, the effect of granting rehearing in banc is \"to vacate the previous opinion and judgment of the court, to stay the mandate and to restore the case on the docket as a pending appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oral arguments before the court in banc were heard February 8, 1973.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No specific desegregation plan has been ordered by the District Court.

CHRONOLOGY OF PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan to effect a more balanced distribution of black and white students in the senior high schools through enactment of changes in attendance zones involving some 12,000 pupils, to become effective over a three year period.  Three months later this modest effort was thwarted by the legislature of the State of Michigan through enactment of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970.  Section 12 of the Act delayed implementation of the plan.  The four members of the Board who supported the April 7 plan were removed from office through a citizen initiated recall election.  The new members of the Board and the incumbent members who had orginally opposed the April 7 plan thereafter rescinded it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in this case was filed by individual black and white school children and their parents, and the Detroit branch of the NAACP against the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, its members, and the then Superintendent of Schools, as well as the Governor, the Attorney General, the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Michigan.  (The State of Michigan as such is not a party to this litigation.  References thereto should be read as references to the public officials, State and local, through whom the State is alleged or shown to have acted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleged that the Detroit public school system was and is segregated on the basis of race as the result of actions and policies of the Board of Education and of the State of Michigan.  The complaint specifically challenged the constitutionality of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 of the State of Michigan, which in effect repealed the April 7, 1970 high school desegregation plan formulated by the Detroit Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was heard originally on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of Act 48.  In response to this motion the District Judge denied a preliminary injunction, did not rule on the constitutionality of Act 48, but granted the motion of the Governor and Attorney General of Michigan for dismissal of the cause as to them.  On appeal this court held that Sec. 12 of Act 48 was an unconstitutional interference with the lawful protection of Fourteenth Amendment rights, that there was no abuse of discretion in denying a preliminary injunction, and that the Governor and Attorney General should not have been dismissed as parties defendant at that stage of the proceeding.  The case was remanded to the District Court for an expedited trial on the merits. 433 F.2d 897.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand plaintiffs moved for immediate implementation of the April 7 plan.  On December 3, 1970, following an evidentiary hearing on that plan and two updated plans, the District Court ordered implementation of the \"Magnet\" or \"McDonald\" plan effective at the beginning of the next full school year, pending ultimate disposition on the merits.  Plaintiffs appealed and filed a motion for summary reversal.  This court again held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to adopt the April 7 plan prior to an evidentiary hearing on the allegations of constitutional violations in the complaint.  We remanded the case with instructions to proceed to trial expeditiously on the merits of plaintiffs' allegations concerning the Detroit public school system. 438 F.2d 945.  The trial of the case on the issue of segregation began April 6, 1971, and continued until July 22, 1971, consuming 41 trial days.  On September 27, 1971, the District Court issued its ruling on the issue of segregation, holding that the Detroit public school system was racially segregated as a result of unconstitutional practices on the part of the defendant Detroit Board of Education and the Michigan State defendants. 338 F. Supp. 582.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decision on a motion to join a large number of suburban school districts as parties defendant was deferred on the ground that the motion was premature, in that no reasonably specific desegregation plan was before the court.  The Detroit Board of Education was ordered to submit desegregation plans limited to the City, while State defendants were directed to submit plans encompassing the three-county metropolitan area.  An effort was made to appeal these orders to this court.  On February 23, 1972, this court held the orders to be non-appealable and dismissed the appeal. 468 F.2d 902, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 844, 93 S.Ct. 45, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further proceedings concerning proposals for a Detroit only desegregation remedy and the presentation of three plans therefor, the District Judge on March 24, 1972, issued a ruling entitled \"Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy,\" and on March 28, 1972, he issued \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Detroit Only Plans of Desegregation.\"  He rejected all Detroit only plans, saying in part: \"Relief of segregation in the public schools of the City of Detroit cannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city.\"Subsequently, the District Court issued an order on June 14, 1972, entitled \"Ruling on Desegregation Area and Order for Development of Plan for Desegregation.\"  In this ruling and order the District Court established tentative boundaries for a metropolitan remedy and provided for a panel of nine members to design plans for integration of the Detroit schools and those of 53 metropolitan school districts within certain guidelines. 345 F.Supp. 914.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel recommended preparatory purchases of school buses prior to implementation of an interim plan in September, 1972.  Following a hearing, the District Court on July 11 ordered State defendants to purchase or otherwise acquire 295 school buses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the intervening Congressional action by the enactment of the \"Broomfield Amendment,\" certification was made to the Attorney General of the United States that the constitutionality of Sec. 803 of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, had been called into question.  The Department of Justice intervened, filed a brief and participated in the oral arguments before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the parties to this litigation in one form or another present three basic issues which we phrase as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Are the District Court's findings of fact pertaining to constitutional violations resulting in system-wide racial segregation of the Detroit Public Schools supported by substantial evidence or are they clearly erroneous?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Based on the record in this case, can a constitutionally adequate system of desegregated schools be established within the geographic limits of the Detroit school district?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. On this record does the District Judge's order requiring preparation of a metropolitan plan for cross-district assignment and transportation of school children throughout the Detroit metropolitan area represent a proper exercise of the equity power of the District Court?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Constitutional Violations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>(A) Constitutional violations found to have been committed by the Detroit Board of Education:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Segregative zoning and assignment practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>(a) The District Judge found that the Detroit Board of Education formulated and modified attendance zones to create or perpetuate racial segregation.  He also found that the feeder system for junior and senior high schools was designed to maintain rather than eliminate black or white schools at the higher levels.  Its practice of shaping school attendance zones on a north-south rather than an east-west orientation resulted in attendance zone boundaries conforming to racial dividing lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>(b) He further found that the Detroit Board of Education's policies involved a substantial number of instances of transporting black children past white schools with available school space.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>He also found that it was the policy of the Board of Education to create optional attendance areas which permitted white students to transfer to all white or predominately white schools located nearer the city limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>The District Judge also found that the policies of the Detroit Board of Education (and State Board of Education) concerning school construction in some instances had the purpose of segregating students on a racial basis and in many others resulted in maintaining or increasing segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge's findings of fact pertaining to alteration of zones and feeder patterns are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>\"The Board has created and altered attendance zones, maintained and altered grade structures and created and altered feeder school patterns in a manner which has had the natural, probable and actual effect of continuing black and white pupils in racially segregated schools.  The Board admits at least one instance where it purposefully and intentionally built and maintained a school and its attendance zone to contain black students.  Throughout the last decade (and presently) school attendance zones of opposite racial compositions have been separated by north-south boundary lines, despite the Board's awareness (since at least 1962) that drawing boundary lines in an east-west direction would result in significant integration.  The natural and actual effect of these acts and failures to act has been the creation and perpetuation of school segregation.  There has never been a feeder pattern or zoning change which placed a predominantly white residential area into a predominately black school zone or feeder pattern.  Every school which was 90% or more black in 1960, and which is still in use today, remains 90% or more black.\" 338 F.Supp. at 588.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal conclusion of the District Judge is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>\"5.

We feel it is significant as it represents an attempt on the part of people who make up this organization to effectively deal with the frustrations historically inherent in attempting to provide for minority group children an adequate education within the Detroit Public School System.  A majority of the people of the Negro race moved into the now Center District from other school districts within the limits of the City of Detroit.  Although better housing conditions were but one of the motives for such a move, of equal importance was a desire to provide their children with a more equitable and enriched educational experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'They were aware of the increased population within their new geographical area, and accepted the counselling of the then new administration of the Board of Education, to the effect that additional tax monies would have to be made available if educational standards within the City of Detroit were to be improved, or even maintained.  Consequently, each of them made a strong personal investment in the millage compaign of Spring 1959.  In this campaign, initially, their efforts did not meet the wholehearted approval of the Negro community, since from past experience, particularly involving other millage campaigns, members of the Negro community had observed that the results of the expenditures of monies obtained from additional taxes, had little effect on the facilities, the equipment, or the curriculum available to their children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Despite this resistance, they were aware that there would be less justification for demanding adequate educational opportunities for their children if they did not accept their responsible share for the successful passing of the millage program.  As a consequence of their efforts, their respective schools voted overwhelmingly for the millage program, and they logically expected that positive results would follow their efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Their first disillusionment occurred only a few months, but yet a few weeks after the passage of the millage-they were rewarded with the creation of the present Center District.  In effect this District, with a few minor exceptions, created a segregated school system.  It accomplished with a few marks of the crayon on the map, the return of the Negro child from the few instances of an integrated school exposure, to the traditional predominantly uniracial school system to which he had formerly been accustomed in the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Their attempts to meet this threat to their children's educational experience through existing school organizations met with little success.  Their conferences with District and City-Wide administrators including the superintendent, Dr. Samuel Brownell, resulted in only rationalizations concerning segregated housing patterns, and denials of any attempts at segregation.  When it was pointed out that regardless of motivation, that segregation was the result of their boundary changes, little compromise was effected, except in one or two instances, where opposition leadership was most vocal and aggressive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Concurrent with boundary changes, it was alarmingly noticeable that the school population within the Center District was rapidly increasing, and that the priority building program would have little positive effect in dealing with the problem.  Attempts to discuss this problem with school and district administration gave promise of only minimal relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Finally, it had been earlier noted by new residents moving into what is now the Center District that prior to and during its change from a uniracial (predominatly white) to a biracial system and again to a uniracial (predominatly Negro) school system that the quality of their children's previous educational experiences did not equip them to compete on an equal basis with resident children in the same grade and classifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'These experiences made them aware that no one organization composed of one or several schools, could effectively coordinate the mutual concern of the many parents residing within the Center District.  Thus out of the several discussions of groups of people whose primary concern was the adequate and equitable education of their children, this organization was born.  It is felt that no better description of its purpose, its objective, and its reason for being can be found than in the preamble to its Constitution, which is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'PREAMBLE: Our interest is in equal educational opportunities for all persons within the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We do not believe that such opportunities are possible within a segregated school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We oppose a policy of containment of minority groups within specified boundaries, an example of which is the Center District.  While the above is of utmost concern to us we are also aware that there is need for improvement and enrichment of the standards within this district in practice as well as in theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We believe that once standards have become reasonably adequate, that such standards should be maintained.  It should be further recognized that future population shifts brought about by urban redevelopment will adversely affect the above goals in the Center District, unless there is anticipation of the impact of this population growth upon this district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Since the inception of our organization we have noted the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The public school system of the City of Detroit is divided into nine administrative districts, one of which is the Center District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Yet, every day, when the children in this city leave their homes to go forth to public schools, approximately one out of every four leaves a home in the Center District.  Of the 154,969 children enrolled in public elementary schools as of September 30, 1960, 36,264 or 23.4 percent of these children leave a home in the Center District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'There are 221 elementary school buildings in the Detroit Public School System.  Of these 28 are in the Center District.  This means, then, that the 23.4 percent of the total elementary school population is accommodated in 12.7 percent of the buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Fifteen percent of these children sit in classes of 40 to 44 students per class.

These schools in the Center District find their capacities short by 6,352 pupil stations.  In other words, their capacities are overtaxed to the extent of 16 percent; and the future building program, as set forth by the superintendent's report of October 17, 1960, will make available only 11,189 additional pupil stations within the next ten-year period.  However, this will be insufficient to meet the demands of the Center District.  Therefore, it is apparent that a school bussing program will have to become a permanent part of the school housing program.  Thus the manner in which the bussing program is administered becomes a matter of acute concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Presently, children are being bussed by grades.

Well, I think from the examples I have given so far it would give an indication that integration could have been effected in a much better way if the children, instead of going to the schools would have been dropped off at other schools where the racial balance was quite different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. Are there any white schools from your examination of data, Doctor Foster, between Angell and Higginbotham which had capacity at that time?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A. Yes, there were several which were a good deal closer to Angell than Higginbotham.  The effect of this sort of zoning pattern was to provide segregated student ratios at all three of the elementary schools, and in terms of things that could be done or could have been done at that particular time to correct the segregated situation, it is my opinion that, first of all, the students being bussed from Angell could have been dropped off at any number of places on the way to Higginbotham, schools which had the space and had a better racial composition for this sort of input.  This having been done, zone lines could have been redrawn at these three schools to have approached a racial balance situation which, in my opinion, would have helped to stabilize the situation at that time.  This would have also assisted in the overcrowding at Pasteur and a couple of classrooms extra at Higginbotham.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q.

Well, it is obvious that if you transport black children past white schools to an all black school that the community is going to perceive this as a segregated intent, a segregated action.  If you have a boundary situation which isolates and enforces black students to a particular area when the boundary lines could be changed to effectuate a better pattern racially, then it seems to me that community perception would also be that the school is not doing what it could in terms of integration and equal opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q.

For many years the record indicates this practice to have been pervasive.  It continued in at least one instance up to the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to optional attendance zones, the District Judge found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p>\"During the decade beginning in 1950 the Board created and maintained optional attendance zones in neighborhoods undergoing racial transition and between high school attendance areas of opposite predominant racial compositions.  In 1959 there were eight basic optional attendance areas affecting 21 schools.  Optional attendance areas provided pupils living within certain elementary areas a choice of attendance at one of two high schools.  In addition there was at least one optional area either created or existing in 1960 between two junior high schools of opposite predominant racial components.  All of the high school optional areas, except two, were in neighborhoods undergoing racial transition (from white to black) during the 1950s.  The two exceptions were: (1) the option between Southwestern (61.6% black in 1960) and Western (15.3% black); (2) the option between Denby (0% black) and Southeastern (30.9% black).  With the exception of the Denby-Southeastern option (just noted) all of the options were between high schools of opposite predominant racial compositions.  The Southwestern-Western and Denby-Southeastern optional areas are all white on the 1950, 1960 and 1970 census maps.  Both Southwestern and Southeastern, however, had substantial white pupil populations, and the option allowed whites to escape integration.  The natural, probable, foreseeable and actual effect of these optional zones was to allow white youngsters to escape identifiably 'black' schools.  There had also been an optional zone (eliminated between 1956 and 1959) created in 'an attempt . . . to separate Jews and Gentiles within the system,' the effect of which was that Jewish youngsters went to Mumford High School and Gentile youngsters went to Cooley.  Although many of these optional areas had served their purpose by 1960 due to the fact that most of the areas had become predominantly black, one optional area (Southwestern-Western affecting Wilson Junior High graduates) continued until the present school year (and will continue to effect 11th and 12th grade white youngsters who elected to escape from predominantly black Southwestern to predominantly white Western High School).  Mr. Henrickson, the Board's general fact witness, who was employed in 1959 to, inter alia, eliminate optional areas, noted in 1967 that: 'In operation Western appears to be still the school to which white students escape from predominantly Negro surrounding schools.'  The effect of eliminating this optional area (which affected only 10th graders for the 1970-71 school year) was to decrease Southwestern from 86.7% black in 1969 to 74.3% black in 1970.\" 338 F.

If you have, let's say, two high school districts, District X and District Y, frequently when you set up an optional zone you carve the zone out of one district, occasionally two, but assume we carve it out of District Y and the children in this optional zone are then permitted to go to either high school X or high school Y, this becomes in a sense an overlapping zone because if we refer to the boundaries of school District X at this point it not only includes the previous boundary but also takes in the optional zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p>\"District Y in turn would include its previous boundaries, also including the optional zone.

Sometimes these are set up for socio-economic reasons and I have on occasion seen them set up by boards of superintendents as political gimicks in order to help pass a bond issue or one thing or another or a school board or superintendent will set up temporary optional zones as a favor to certain constitutents in return for assistance in helping the school board with one thing or another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p>\"I think in the framework in which we operate they are used primarily for maintaining segregated patterns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p274\">\n      <span class=\"num\">274</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p275\">\n      <span class=\"num\">275</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p276\">\n      <span class=\"num\">276</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

Yes, I think the perception is not only of rank and file community residents, but people of considerable influence in the community, along with School Board administration people, School Board members, School Board officials.  In many cases they have substantiated this perception that I have recounted; that the optional zones did lead to greater pupil segregation and a feeling of frustration that the school authorities were not doing what was called for in terms of desegregation, and it had a generally debilitating effect on the image of the schools as far as all of these groups were concerned.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p301\">\n      <span class=\"num\">301</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Henrickson, defendant School Board's principal witness and divisional director of planning and building studies in the School Housing Division, did not deny the discriminatory effect of at least some of these optional zones.\"Q.

(See Sec. V(A), pp. 245-249, infra.)  Hence, the segregative actions and inactions of the Detroit Board of Education previously outlined are the actions of an agency of the State of Michigan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p414\">\n      <span class=\"num\">414</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) In 1970 the Detroit School Board undertook implementation of its April 7 desegregation plan applicable to its high schools.  On meeting considerable resistance thereto, it nonetheless proceeded.  At that point the State Legislature intervened by Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 specifically overruling the Detroit Board of Education's desegregation plan.  While this statute has since been invalidated by judgment of this court, 433 F.2d 897, its contribution to preventing desegregation and to continuing and increasing segregation of the Detroit school system cannot be overlooked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p415\">\n      <span class=\"num\">415</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Under Michigan law, M.S.A.

Prior to 1962 the State Board also had specific statutory authority to supervise school site selection.  The proofs concerning the effect of Detroit's school construction program are therefore largely applicable to show State responsibility for the segregative results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p416\">\n      <span class=\"num\">416</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) During the critical years covered by this record the School District of Detroit was denied any allocation of State funds for pupil transportation, although such funds were made generally available for students who lived over a mile and a half from their assigned schools in rural Michigan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p417\">\n      <span class=\"num\">417</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Finally, the cross-district transportation of black high school students from the Carver School, located in Ferndale school district, to a black high school in Detroit could not have taken place without the approval, tacit or express, of the State Board of Education.

The State refused, until this session of the legislature, to provide authorization of funds for the transportation of pupils within Detroit regardless of their poverty or distance from the school to which they were assigned, while providing in many neighboring, mostly white, suburban districts the full range of state supported transportation.  This and other financial limitations, such as those on bonding and the working of the state aid formula whereby suburban districts were able to make far larger per pupil expenditures despite less tax effort, have created and perpetuated systematic educational inequalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p420\">\n      <span class=\"num\">420</span>\n      <p>\"The State, exercising what Michigan courts have held to be is 'plenary power' which includes power 'to use a statutory scheme, to create, alter, reorganize or even dissolve a school district, despite any desire of the school district, its board, or the inhabitants thereof,' acted to reorganize the school district of the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p421\">\n      <span class=\"num\">421</span>\n      <p>\"The State acted through Act 48 to impede, delay and minimize racial integration in Detroit schools.

Under the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and laws of the State of Michigan, the responsibility for providing educational opportunity to all children on constitutional terms is ultimately that of the state.

That a state's form of government may delegate the power of daily administration of public schools to officials with less than state-wide jurisdiction does not dispel the obligation of those who have broader control to use the authority they have consistently with the constitution.  In such instances the constitutional obligation toward the individual school children is a shared one.  Bradley v. Sch.

The State statutory scheme of support of transportation for school children directly discriminated against Detroit.  Dr. John W.

The State pays roughly 75 percent of the cost.  Last year the appropriation was $29 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p432\">\n      <span class=\"num\">432</span>\n      <p>\"Q. Do you know what percent of the school children in the State of Michigan are transported to the school at public expense?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p433\">\n      <span class=\"num\">433</span>\n      <p>\"A. Yes, I do. 40 percent of all students in Michigan are transported.

Dr. Porter, is there some formula in terms of distance which makes a child eligible for transportation that would be aided by the state?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p435\">\n      <span class=\"num\">435</span>\n      <p>\"A. Yes.  It is a very complicated formula that 197 computations, and we are in the process right now of reducing this-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p436\">\n      <span class=\"num\">436</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

A mile and a half outside the city limits.  Until this year the legislature amended the Act based upon the recommendations of the State Board of Education to allow for incity transportation which we had never had before.  The legislature did not appropriate funds for that.  So, now the funds that are now used are basically for rural areas and suburban areas where the students live a mile and a half from the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p438\">\n      <span class=\"num\">438</span>\n      <p>\"Q. When you say 'city,' is there some limitation?  For instance, would Grosse Pointe, Harper Woods, areas like that that surround the City of Detroit, are they eligible for transportation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p439\">\n      <span class=\"num\">439</span>\n      <p>\"A. In the in-city.

Well, I think my question may have been confusing.  Is there some type of city-is it just any place incorporated as a city that is differentiated from the rural areas, or certain cities eligible for this state aid at the present time and receive the funds-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p441\">\n      <span class=\"num\">441</span>\n      <p>\"THE COURT: I think what Mr. Lucas is trying to get at is whether under the old practice whether any city has ceased state aid for transportation within the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p442\">\n      <span class=\"num\">442</span>\n      <p>\"A. Yes, we have a number of instances where the city would be receiving aid for transportation, because the law says that if the bus in order to get the students to the school crosses outside of the city boundary, the city is then eligible for aid, and we, and we have a number of instances where that exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p443\">\n      <span class=\"num\">443</span>\n      <p>\"THE COURT: In other words, where the student originates his ride outside the city limits transportation is assisted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p444\">\n      <span class=\"num\">444</span>\n      <p>\"A. That's right, or where the student lives in the city but the bus has to go outside of the city and come back he is also eligible.  This, however, does not negate local city officials, school board officials from providing transportation.  There is no prohibition against that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p445\">\n      <span class=\"num\">445</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

The law was changed last year to permit in-city bus transportation but in changing the law the legislature said our department had to disburse the funds to the eligible existing areas which meant that since they did not increase the amount of funds appropriated we could not provide for in-city transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p447\">\n      <span class=\"num\">447</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

That is correct, or any other area.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p451\">\n      <span class=\"num\">451</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clearest example of direct State participation in encouraging the segregated condition of Detroit public schools, however, is that of school construction in Detroit and the surrounding suburban areas.  Until 1962 the State Board of Education had direct statutory control over site planning for new school construction.  During that time, as was pointed out above, the State approved school construction which fostered segregation throughout the Detroit Metropolitan area.  (See supra pp. 235-239).  Since 1962 the State Board has continued to be involved in approval of school construction plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p452\">\n      <span class=\"num\">452</span>\n      <p>IV. Conclusion as to Constitutional Violations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p453\">\n      <span class=\"num\">453</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discriminatory practices on the part of the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan revealed by this record are significant, pervasive and causally related to the substantial amount of segregation found in the Detroit school system by the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p454\">\n      <span class=\"num\">454</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, of course, a significant distinction between this record and those school segregation cases which have flooded the courts since Brown v. Topeka, infra.  This distinction is that Michigan has never enforced segregation by State laws which provided for separate black and white school systems, as was the pattern prior to 1954 in many other States.  As a consequence, there always have been some instances of actual school integration in Detroit and still more instances of token school integration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p455\">\n      <span class=\"num\">455</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants seek to insulate themselves from remedial action by federal courts by pointing to the long standing public policy of Michigan, as expressed in its statutes, of integration of public education.  However, this court is not blind to the fact that governments can act only through the conduct of their officials and employees and that unconstitutional actions of individuals can be redressed.  See, e. g., Clemons v. Board of Education, 228 F.2d 853 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 1006, 76 S.Ct. 651, 100 L.Ed. 868 (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p456\">\n      <span class=\"num\">456</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case amply supports the findings of the District Court of unconstitutional actions by public officials at both the local and State level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p457\">\n      <span class=\"num\">457</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically de jure segregation has come about through statutory command explicitly establishing dual school systems.  Michigan's declared public policy is urged as a controlling distinction.  No matter how important this distinction may be, it does not in our judgment negate the de jure segregation findings entered in this case by the District Judge.  As said in United States v. The Board of School Commissioners of the City of Indianapolis, 474 F.2d 81, 83 (7th Cir. 1973): \"[T]he actions of the Board of School Commissioners and its duly-appointed representatives and agents may be sufficient to constitute de jure segregation without being based on a state law, or even if they are in derogation of state law forbidding segregation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p458\">\n      <span class=\"num\">458</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains substantial evidence to support the finding of the District Court that the segregation of the Detroit public schools, however rooted in private residential segregation, also was validated and augmented by the Detroit Board of Education and Michigan State Board action of pervasive influence through the system.  Even if the segregation practices were a bit more subtle than the compulsory segregation statutes of Southern States, they were nonetheless effective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p459\">\n      <span class=\"num\">459</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is our view that the findings of fact pertaining to actions of the Detroit Board of Education and the State of Michigan which caused or contributed to Detroit school segregation are not clearly erroneous and that the District Court was therefore authorized and required to take effective measures to desegregate the Detroit Public School System.

Hearings were had on said plans on March 14, 15, 16, 17 and 21, 1972.  In considering these plans the court does not limit itself to the proofs offered at the hearing just concluded; it considers as part of the evidence bearing on the issue (i. e., City-Only Plans) all proofs submitted in the case to this point, and it specifically incorporates herein by reference the Findings and Conclusions contained in its \"Ruling on Issue of Segregation,\" filed September 27, 1971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p465\">\n      <span class=\"num\">465</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The court makes the following factual findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p466\">\n      <span class=\"num\">466</span>\n      <p>\"PLAN A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p467\">\n      <span class=\"num\">467</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"1. The court finds that this plan is an elaboration and extension of the socalled Magnet Plan, previously authorized for implementation as an interim plan pending hearing and determination on the issue of segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p468\">\n      <span class=\"num\">468</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"2. As proposed we find, at the high school level, that it offers a greater and wider degree of specialization, but any hope that it would be effective to desegregate the public schools of the City of Detroit at that level is virtually ruled out by the failure of the current model to achieve any appreciable success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p469\">\n      <span class=\"num\">469</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"3. We find, at the Middle School level, that the expanded model would affect, directly, about 24,000 pupils of a total of 140,000 in the grades covered; and its effect would be to set up a school system within the school system, and would intensify the segregation in schools not included in the Middle School program.  In this sense, it would increase segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p470\">\n      <span class=\"num\">470</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"4.

The plan would require the development of transportation on a vast scale which, according to the evidence, could not be furnished, ready for operation by the opening of the 1972-73 school year.  The plan contemplates the transportation of 82,000 pupils and would require the acquisition of some 900 vehicles, the hiring and training of a great number of drivers, the procurement of space for storage and maintenance, the recruitment of maintenance and the not negligible task of designing a transportation system to service the schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p478\">\n      <span class=\"num\">478</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"4. The plan would entail an overall recasting of the Detroit school system, when there is little assurance that it would not have to undergo another reorganization if a metropolitan plan is adopted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p479\">\n      <span class=\"num\">479</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"5. It would involve the expenditure of vast sums of money and effort which would be wasted or lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p480\">\n      <span class=\"num\">480</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"6.

The plan would make the Detroit school system more identifiably Black, and leave many of its schools 75 to 90 per cent Black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p482\">\n      <span class=\"num\">482</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"8. It would change a school system which is now Black and White to one that would be perceived as Black, thereby increasing the flight of Whites from the city and the system, thereby increasing the Black student population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p483\">\n      <span class=\"num\">483</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"9.

On the basis of the court's finding of illegal school segregation, the obligation of the school defendants is to adopt and implement an educationally sound, practicable plan of desegregation that promises realistically to achieve now and hereafter the greatest possible degree of actual school desegregation.

Detroit Board of Education Plans A and C are legally insufficient because they do not promise to effect significant desegregation.  Green v.

Plaintiffs' Plan, while it would provide a racial mix more in keeping with the Black-White proportions of the student population than under either of the Board's plans or as the system now stands, would accentuate the racial identifiability of the district as a Black school system, and would not accomplish desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p490\">\n      <span class=\"num\">490</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"5. The conclusion, under the evidence in this case, is inescapable that relief of segregation in the public schools of the City of Detroit cannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city.  The State, however, cannot escape its constitutional duty to desegregate the public schools of the City of Detroit by pleading local authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p491\">\n      <span class=\"num\">491</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p492\">\n      <span class=\"num\">492</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p493\">\n      <span class=\"num\">493</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"School district lines are simply matters of political convenience and may not be used to deny constitutional rights.  If the boundary lines of the school districts of the City of Detroit and the surrounding suburbs were drawn today few would doubt that they could not withstand constitutional challenge.  In seeking for solutions to the problem of school segregation, other federal courts have not \"treated as immune from intervention the administrative structure of a state's educational system, to the extent that it affects the capacity to desegregate.  Geographically or administratively independent units have been compelled to merge or to initiate or continue cooperative operation as a single system for school desegregation purposes.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p494\">\n      <span class=\"num\">494</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"That the court must look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a solution to the problem of segregation in the Detroit public schools is obvious; that it has the authority, nay more, the duty to (under the circumstances of this case) do so appears plainly anticipated by Brown II,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> seventeen years ago.  While other school cases have not had to deal with our exact situation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the logic of their application of the command of Brown II supports our view of our duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p495\">\n      <span class=\"num\">495</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge's finding that no Detroit only plan can achieve desegregation of the Detroit public school system points up another substantial distinction between this case and the classical school segregation case.  This record presents a wholly new fact pattern in a school segregation case so far as this Circuit is concerned.  This court never before has been confronted by a finding that any less comprehensive a solution than a metropolitan area plan would result in an all black school system immediately surrounded by practically all white suburban school systems, with an overwhelmingly white majority population in the total metropolitan area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p496\">\n      <span class=\"num\">496</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relevant to and supportive of the District Judge's findings are these school census figures showing trends toward segregation in the Detroit schools during the last decade:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p497\">\n      <span class=\"num\">497</span>\n      <p>1960     100 of 251 schools were 90%</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p498\">\n      <span class=\"num\">498</span>\n      <p>or more white</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p499\">\n      <span class=\"num\">499</span>\n      <p>71 of 251 schools were 90%</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p500\">\n      <span class=\"num\">500</span>\n      <p>or more black</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p501\">\n      <span class=\"num\">501</span>\n      <p>68% of all schools were 90%</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p502\">\n      <span class=\"num\">502</span>\n      <p>or more one race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p503\">\n      <span class=\"num\">503</span>\n      <p>1970     69 of 282 schools were 90%</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p504\">\n      <span class=\"num\">504</span>\n      <p>or more white</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p505\">\n      <span class=\"num\">505</span>\n      <p>133 of 282 schools were 90%</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p506\">\n      <span class=\"num\">506</span>\n      <p>or more black</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>71.6% of all schools were</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p507\">\n      <span class=\"num\">507</span>\n      <p>90% or more one race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1960-61  65.8% of the total number</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p508\">\n      <span class=\"num\">508</span>\n      <p>of black students in regular</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p509\">\n      <span class=\"num\">509</span>\n      <p>schools were 90% or more</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p510\">\n      <span class=\"num\">510</span>\n      <p>black schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1970-71  74.9% of the total number</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p511\">\n      <span class=\"num\">511</span>\n      <p>of black students in regular</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p512\">\n      <span class=\"num\">512</span>\n      <p>schools were in 90% or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p513\">\n      <span class=\"num\">513</span>\n      <p>more black schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p514\">\n      <span class=\"num\">514</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This record reflects a present and expanding pattern of all black schools in Detroit (resulting in part from State action) separated only by school district boundaries from nearby all white schools.

Following the holding of Welling v. Livonia Board of Education, supra, that there was no minimum length of day required under the 180-day school attendance rule absent a State Board of Education regulation, the Michigan State Board of Education, acting under its Constitutional mandate without legislative authority, established an administrative rule requiring local school boards to provide a minimum number of hours per school year.

When Public Act 289 became effective, 1,438 public school districts existed in Michigan.  By the beginning of 1968, this figure had been reduced to 738, meaning that 700 school districts in Michigan have disappeared since 1964 through reorganization.

Pursuant to Act 289 of 1964, supra, the State Board of Education ordered the merger of the Brownstown No. 10, Hand, Maple Grove and Carson school districts, all in Wayne County.  The action is best explained by the fact that Brownstown was, at that time, the wealthiest school district in the State, indeed, with a property valuation of $340,000 backing each child, perhaps the wealthiest district in the nation, while the other three districts were extremely poor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p538\">\n      <span class=\"num\">538</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. When the Sumpter School District was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1968, the State Board of Education, acting under Public Act 239 of 1967 (M.S.A. Sec. 15.2299(51) et seq., M.C.L.A. Sec. 388.711 et seq.), merged the district with four adjoining districts, including the Airport School District.

The Nankin Mills School District in Wayne County was beset with financial problems and had no high school.

When the Inkster School District in Wayne County was on the verge of financial bankruptcy, the Michigan legislature passed Public Act 32 of 1968 (M.S.A. Sec. 15.1916 et seq., M.C.L.A. Sec. 388.201 et seq.) enabling the district to borrow $705,000 but on the condition that if the district could not balance its budget, the State Board of Education could reorganize, merge or annex the district.  The legislative history of Act 32 indicates at least two legislators voted against the bill in the House of Representatives because of the excessive control given to the State Board of Education:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p541\">\n      <span class=\"num\">541</span>\n      <p>\"I voted No on House Bill No. 3332 because in setting up the machinery to bail out distressed districts, it takes from the local communities the control over their own educational system by providing for excessive arbitrary reorganization powers in the hands of the Board of Education . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p542\">\n      <span class=\"num\">542</span>\n      <p>\"This bill certainly sets up the State Board of Education to be a dictator of all school districts that run into financial problems.\" 1968 Journal of the House of Representatives 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p543\">\n      <span class=\"num\">543</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. Too small and too poor to operate a high school, the all-black Carver School District in suburban Oakland County reached a crisis in 1960 when other surrounding white districts refused to accept Carver pupils on a tuition basis.

The State Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction may withhold State aid for failure to operate the minimum school year.  M.S.A. Sec. 15.3575, M.C.L.A. Sec. 340.575.  In 1970, funds were withheld from the City of Grand Rapids School District. 17 Michigan School Board Journal 3 (March, 1970).  For Attorney General Opinions holding that State aid may be withheld by the State Board of Education from school districts for hiring uncertified teachers, defaulting on State loans and for other reasons, see Op.Atty.Gen.

The State of Michigan contributes, on the average, 34% of the operating budgets of the 54 school districts included in the proposed Metropolitan Plan of Integration.  In eleven of the 54 districts, the State's contribution exceeds 50% and in eight more, it exceeds 40%.  State aid is appropriated from the General Fund, revenue raised through state-wide taxation, and is distributed annually to the local school districts under a formula devised by the legislature.  See, e. g., Public Act 134 (1971), M.S.A. Sec. 15.1919(51), M.C.L.A. Sec. 388.611.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p546\">\n      <span class=\"num\">546</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the local school districts obtain funds from the assessment of local property, the ultimate authority in insuring equalized property valuations throughout the State is the State Tax Commission.  M.S.A. Sec. 7.631 et seq., M. C.L.A. Sec. 209.101 et seq.; M.S.A. Sec. 7.206, M.C.L.A. Sec. 211.148; M.S.A. Sec. 7.52, M.C.L.A. Sec. 211.34.  The State's duty to equalize is required by the Michigan Constitution, Article IX, Section 3. This \"State equalized valuation\" serves as the basis for calculating local revenue yields.  See, Ranking of Michigan Public High School-School Districts by Selected Financial Data, 1970, Bulletin 1012, Michigan State Department of Education (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p547\">\n      <span class=\"num\">547</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. The Michigan School Code reaffirms the ultimate control of the State over public education.  Local school districts must observe all State laws relating to schools,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> hold school a minimum number of days per year,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> employ only certified teachers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> teach civics, health and physical education and drivers' education,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> excuse students to attend religious instruction classes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> observe State requirements when teaching sex education,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> make annual financial and other reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> adopt only textbooks which are listed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> and must follow all rules and regulations of the State Department of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p548\">\n      <span class=\"num\">548</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local school districts, unless they have the approval of the State Board of Education or the Superintendent of Public Instruction, cannot consolidate with another school district,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> annex territory,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> divide or attach parts of other districts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> borrow monies in anticipation of State aid,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> or construct, reconstruct or remodel school buildings or additions to them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p549\">\n      <span class=\"num\">549</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The power to withhold State aid, of course, effects enormous leverage upon any local school district, since on the average 34 per cent of the operation budget of the 54 school districts included in the proposed Metropolitan Plan is paid for by the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p550\">\n      <span class=\"num\">550</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instance of the City of Detroit, the State exhibited its understanding of its power over the local school district by the adoption of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 which repealed a high school desegregation plan previously adopted by the Detroit Board of Education.  See 433 F.2d 897.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. De Jure Acts of Segregation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p551\">\n      <span class=\"num\">551</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the record establishes that the State has committed de jure acts of segregation and that the State controls the instrumentalities whose action is necessary to remedy the harmful effects of the State acts.  There can be little doubt that a federal court has both the power and the duty to effect a feasible desegregation plan.  Indeed, such is the essence of Brown II.  Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300-301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955).  In the instant case the only feasible desegregation plan involves the crossing of the boundary lines between the Detroit School District and adjacent or nearby school districts for the limited purpose of providing an effective desegregation plan.  The power to disregard such artificial barriers is all the more clear where, as here, the State has been guilty of discrimination which had the effect of creating and maintaining racial segregation along school district lines.  See Section III B, pp. 238-241, supra.  United States v. Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972); Wright v. City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 463, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972); United States v. State of Texas, 447 F.2d 441, 443-444 (5th Cir. 1971); Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier County, 429 F.2d 364, 368 (8th Cir. 1970).  See also Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, 402 U.S. 33, 36-38, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p552\">\n      <span class=\"num\">552</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There exists, however, an even more compelling basis for the District Court's crossing artificial boundary lines to cure the State's constitutional violations.  The instant case calls up haunting memories of the now long overruled and discredited \"separate but equal doctrine\" of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896).  If we hold that school district boundaries are absolute barriers to a Detroit school desegregation plan, we would be opening a way to nullify Brown v. Board of Education which overruled Plessy, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p553\">\n      <span class=\"num\">553</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court in considering this record finds it impossible to declare \"clearly erroneous\" the District Judge's conclusion that any Detroit only desegregation plan will lead directly to a single segregated Detroit school district overwhelmingly black in all of its schools, surrounded by a ring of suburbs and suburban school districts overwhelmingly white in composition in a State in which the racial composition is 87 per cent white and 13 per cent black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p554\">\n      <span class=\"num\">554</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal with a record which demonstrates more than ample support for the District Judge's findings of unconstitutional segregation by race resulting in major part from action and inaction of public authorities, both local and State.  This segregation is found in the school system of the inner city of a metropolitan area 81% white against 19% nonwhite.  Under this record a remedial order of a court of equity which left the Detroit school system overwhelmingly black (for the foreseeable future) surrounded by suburban school systems overwhelmingly white cannot correct the constitutional violations herein found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p555\">\n      <span class=\"num\">555</span>\n      <p>VI.

We reiterate this, keeping in mind the admonition from Chief Justice Marshall:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p558\">\n      <span class=\"num\">558</span>\n      <p>\"The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.

We reiterate that school districts and school boards are instrumentalities of the State.  See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L. Ed.2d 5 (1958).  As early as Brown II the Supreme Court pointed out that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p560\">\n      <span class=\"num\">560</span>\n      <p>\"[T]he courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, . . . .\" 349 U.S. at 300-301, 75 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p561\">\n      <span class=\"num\">561</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that school boundary lines cannot be changed or new school systems created where the result is a larger imbalance in racial ratios in school systems where all vestiges of enforced racial segregation have not been eliminated.  United States v. Scotland Neck Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972); Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972).

In that case the District Court ordered an actual consolidation of three separate school districts, all of which the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared to be unitary. In the instant case the District Court has not ordered consolidation of school districts, but directed a study of plans for the reassignment of pupils in school districts comprising the metropolitan area of Detroit.  In the Richmond case the court found that neither the Constitution nor statutes of Virginia, previously or presently in effect, would have permitted the State Board of Education, acting alone, to have effected a consolidation of the three school districts into a single system under the control of a single school board.  The Fourth Circuit held that compulsory consolidation of political subdivisions of the State of Virginia was beyond the power of a federal court because of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The decisions which now are under review did not contemplate such a restructuring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p565\">\n      <span class=\"num\">565</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the court in the Richmond case cited provisions of the Constitution and statutes of Virginia in support of its holding that-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p566\">\n      <span class=\"num\">566</span>\n      <p>\"The power to operate, maintain and supervise public schools in Virginia is, and always has been, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the local school boards and not within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education.\" 462 F.2d at 1067.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p567\">\n      <span class=\"num\">567</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in the present case amply supports the finding that the State of Michigan has not been subject to such limitations in its dealings with local school boards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p568\">\n      <span class=\"num\">568</span>\n      <p>VII.

Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a> and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-2\" id=\"fn5-2_ref\">5</a>  These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.  At stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory basis.  To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision.  Courts of equity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective manner.

Once such a start has been made, the courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry out the ruling in an effective manner.  The burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practicable date.  To that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems.

This deliberate perpetuation of the unconstitutional dual system can only have compounded the harm of such a system.  Such delays are no longer tolerable, for 'the governing constitutional principles no longer bear the imprint of newly enunciated doctrine.'  Watson v.

There is no universal answer to complex problems of desegregation; there is obviously no one plan that will do the job in every case.  The matter must be assessed in light of the circumstances present and the options available in each instance.  It is incumbent upon the school board to establish that its proposed plan promises meaningful and immediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segregation.  It is incumbent upon the district court to weigh that claim in light of the facts at hand and in light of any alternatives which may be shown as feasible and more promising in their effectiveness.  Where the court finds the board to be acting in good faith and the proposed plan to have real prospects for dismantling the state-imposed dual system 'at the earliest practicable date,' then the plan may be said to provide effective relief.  Of course, the availability to the board of other more promising courses of action may indicate a lack of good faith; and at the least it places a heavy burden upon the board to explain its preference for an apparently less effective method.  Moreover, whatever plan is adopted will require evaluation in practice, and the court should retain jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed segregation has been completely removed.

Id., at 689, 83 S.Ct. at 1409.  So it is here; no attempt has been made to justify the transfer provision as a device designed to meet 'legitimate local problems,' ibid.; rather it patently operates as a device to allow resegregation of the races to the extent desegregation would be achieved by geographically drawn zones.  Respondent's argument in this Court reveals its purpose.  We are frankly told in the Brief that without the transfer option it is apprehended that while students will flee the school system altogether.

As the statement of facts shows, these findings are abundantly supported by the record.

As we said in Green, a school authority's remedial plan or a district court's remedial decree is to be judged by its effectiveness.  Awareness of the racial composition of the whole school system is likely to be a useful starting point in shaping a remedy to correct past constitutional violations.

An additional step was pairing, 'clustering,' or 'grouping' of schools with attendance assignments made deliberately to accomplish the transfer of Negro students out of formerly segregated Negro schools and transfer of white students to formerly all-Negro schools.  More often than not, these zones are neither compact nor contiguous; indeed they may be on opposite ends of the city.

All things being equal, with no history of discrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes.  But all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation.  The remedy for such segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p605\">\n      <span class=\"num\">605</span>\n      <p>\"No fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can go, but it must be recognized that there are limits.  The objective is to dismantle the dual school system. 'Racially neutral' assignment plans proposed by school authorities to a district court may be inadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion of school size in order to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation.  When school authorities present a district court with a 'loaded game board,' affirmative action in the form of remedial altering of attendance zones is proper to achieve truly non-discriminatory assignments.

No rigid guidelines as to student transportation can be given for application to the infinite variety of problems presented in thousands of situations.  Bus transportation has been an integral part of the public education system for years, and was perhaps the single most important factor in the transition from the one-room schoolhouse to the consolidated school.  Eighteen million of the Nation's public school children, approximately 39%, were transported to their schools by bus in 1969-1970 in all parts of the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p610\">\n      <span class=\"num\">610</span>\n      <p>\"The importance of bus transportation as a normal and accepted tool of educational policy is readily discernible in this and the companion case, Davis, supra.

The trips for elementary school pupils average about seven miles and the District Court found that they would take 'not over 35 minutes at the most.'  This system compares favorably with the transportation plan previously operated in Charlotte under which each day 23,600 students on all grade levels were transported an average of 15 miles one way for an average trip requiring over an hour.  In these circumstances, we find no basis for holding that the local school authorities may not be required to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation.

It hardly needs stating that the limits on time of travel will vary with many factors, but probably with none more than the age of the students.

Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) was announced, the legislature of the State of Michigan, in Public Acts of Michigan, 1867, Act 34 Sec. 28, had abolished segregation in the public school system which had prohibited Negro children from attending the same public schools as white children.  This statute in relevant parts reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p630\">\n      <span class=\"num\">630</span>\n      <p>\"All residents of any district shall have an equal right to attend any school therein. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p631\">\n      <span class=\"num\">631</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Michigan, in an opinion written for the court by Chief Justice Cooley, construed the statute in 1869 and held it applicable to Detroit and that Detroit constituted one school district.  In granting a writ of mandamus requiring the school board to admit a Negro child who had been denied admission, Chief Justice Cooley said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p632\">\n      <span class=\"num\">632</span>\n      <p>\"It cannot be seriously urged that with this provision in force, the school board of any district which is subject to it may make regulations which would exclude any resident of the district from any of its schools, because of race or color, or religious belief, or personal peculiarities.  It is too plain for argument that an equal right to all of the schools, irrespective of such distinctions, was meant to be established.\"  People, ex rel. Workman v. Board of Education of Detroit, 18 Mich. 400, 409 (1869).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p633\">\n      <span class=\"num\">633</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues in this case do not concern the right of any Negro child in Detroit to attend any school he desires in that City.  They do involve the authority of a district judge to adopt a so-called metropolitan plan designed to integrate the Negro school children living in Detroit with white children living in three adjoining counties and attending public schools in fifty-two additional school districts, eighteen of which districts have never been made parties to this lawsuit.  Conditions were imposed on the districts allowed to intervene which rendered their intervention ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p634\">\n      <span class=\"num\">634</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge followed the pattern of Judge Merhige in the Richmond case whose decision was reversed by the Fourth Circuit in Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by equally divided court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.Ed.2d 771 (Nos. 72-549, 72-550, 1973).  41 U.S.L.W. 4685.  The fact that Richmond involved dismantling of a dual system was regarded as unimportant by the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p635\">\n      <span class=\"num\">635</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an unprecedented opinion, a panel of this Court and now a majority of the en banc Court have upheld findings of the District Court that segregation exists in Detroit and that it cannot be dismantled with a Detroit-only plan of desegregation and the District Court may consider and adopt a metropolitan plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p636\">\n      <span class=\"num\">636</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just to start such a plan involves the expenditure of about $3,000,000 for the purchase of 295 buses and untold millions of dollars to operate them and for other expenses.  It will involve about 780,000 children and, if ordered by the court, will force the busing of black children, against their will and without the consent of their parents, from the inner city of Detroit to one or more of the fifty-three different school districts in four counties, and the white children of these districts will be forcibly bused to the inner city.  None of these children have committed any offense for which they should be so punished.  It will disrupt the lives of these children and their parents.  The metropolitan plan was ill conceived and is a legal monstrosity.  However, such a plan will achieve a racial balance or quota in the desegregation area, which is what plaintiffs are seeking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p637\">\n      <span class=\"num\">637</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court made no findings that any of the fifty-two school districts outside of Detroit had practiced desegregation tactics against Negro children in their districts or in any other district, or that they were in any wise responsible for the concentration of Negroes or their segregation in Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p638\">\n      <span class=\"num\">638</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These fifty-two school districts have been created by the legislature as separate and independent corporate units with power to sue and be sued.  They are governed by locally-elected Boards of Education.  In each district, the real estate of the people living therein is taxed for the support of their public schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p639\">\n      <span class=\"num\">639</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school districts were established by neutral legislation when the cities were incorporated.  There was not an iota of evidence in the record that the boundaries of the Detroit school district, or any other school district in Michigan, were established for the purpose of creating, maintaining or perpetuating segregation of the races.  No such claim was ever made by the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p640\">\n      <span class=\"num\">640</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1910, long after the districts were created, the black population of Detroit was only 1.2% of the total population of the City.  By 1970 it had increased to 43.9% of the total population of 1,511,000.  It is obvious that the great influx of blacks, as well as whites, to Detroit was influenced by the favorable industrial climate existing in Michigan and the ability of its industry, principally automotive, to provide jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p641\">\n      <span class=\"num\">641</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the school year 1970-1971, there was 285,512 students in the public school system in Detroit of which 168,200 or 63.8% were black and 117,312 or 37.2% were white.  The School Board of Detroit ought not to be blamed for the heavy concentration of blacks in the inner City, for housing conditions, or for discrimination by public or private agencies or individuals and ought not to be saddled with the duty to dismantle the concentration.  These same conditions exist in other cities throughout the country regardless of the type of school system in effect-whether de jure or de facto.  Nor should the adjoining three counties and the fifty-two school districts be penalized because they are located near Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p642\">\n      <span class=\"num\">642</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his book Negroes in Cities, Dr. Karl Taeuber states that residential segregation exists \"regardless of the character of local laws and policies and regardless of other forms of discrimination\".  He said substantially the same thing in his article \"Residential Segregation\" in the August, 1965 issue of Scientific American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p643\">\n      <span class=\"num\">643</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bradley v.

A large metropolitan area such as we have in our case can not be made the subject of instant integration.  We must bear in mind that the task we are called upon to perform is a social one, which society has been unable to accomplish.  In reality, our courts are called upon, in these school cases, to attain a social goal, through the educational system, by using law as a lever.\"  App. IV, pp. 454, 455.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p648\">\n      <span class=\"num\">648</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is incredible!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p649\">\n      <span class=\"num\">649</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is submitted that the courts are not called upon to integrate the school system, using law as a lever.

In Spencer the black students sued the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey, the Commissioner of Education and the State Board of Education alleging that they failed to achieve a racial balance among several districts of a state system of public schools.  New Jersey, like Michigan, did not operate a dual system and the alleged imbalance was characterized as de facto segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p657\">\n      <span class=\"num\">657</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three-judge Court which heard the case stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p658\">\n      <span class=\"num\">658</span>\n      <p>\"In none of the schools of which the plaintiffs complain is any black pupil 'segregated' from any white pupil.  Indeed, complaint is made that the blacks who reside in the school district served predominate over the whites, thus affording an example of complete desegregation which was the expressed object of the court in the Brown case. 347 U.S. at page 487 of the Opinion at page 688 of 74 S.Ct. in Brown it is stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p659\">\n      <span class=\"num\">659</span>\n      <p>'In each of the cases [from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware] minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis.  In each instance, they had been denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p660\">\n      <span class=\"num\">660</span>\n      <p>Such is not the basis upon which each of the plaintiffs in the present case seeks relief in this cause.  On the contrary plaintiffs would have a substantial portion of the pupils now in attendance in their respective schools ordered by the court removed from these schools and assigned to a school in another district.  Alternatively plaintiffs would have the court abolish the respective districts in which their schools are located and assign them to other districts in which the disproportion between white and black students is reduced in one direction or the other.  If, as plaintiffs contend, the proportionate black attendance in their respective schools adversely affects the degree of excellence of education which they can receive there must be a point at which any excess of blacks over whites is likely to impair the quality of the education available in that school for the black pupils.  Nowhere in the Appendix filed by the plaintiffs or in the facts involved in any of the judicial precedents which they cite are we informed of the specific racial proportions which are likely to assure maximum excellence of the educational advantages available for the whites.  Assuming further that efforts to achieve the ideal interracial proportion necessarily include the alteration of the population factor determinative of the redistricting, there can be no assurance that the population factor will remain static.  If so, it would be necessary to successively reassign pupils to another district as the rate of births and graduations alters the racial proportions creating the demand for the educational facilities as it changes from term to term.  In sum, the difficulty complained of does not amount to unconstitutional segregation.\"  (Id. at 1239-1240).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p661\">\n      <span class=\"num\">661</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Speaking of school district boundaries, the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p662\">\n      <span class=\"num\">662</span>\n      <p>\"It is clear that these legislative enactments prescribe school district boundaries in conformity with municipal boundaries.  This designation of school district zones is therefore based on the geographic limitations of the various municipalities throughout the State.  Nowhere in the drawing of school district lines are considerations of race, creed, color or national origin made.  The setting of municipalities as local school districts is a reasonable standard especially in light of the municipal taxing authority.  The system as provided by the various legislative enactments is unitary in nature and intent and any purported racial imbalance within a local school district results from an imbalance in the population of that municipality-school district.

The percentage of black and white children in the public schools in 1970-1971 was 63.8% and 37.2% respectively.

This forecast is wholly speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p678\">\n      <span class=\"num\">678</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an unsupported and speculative forecast cannot be made the basis for a metropolitan cross-district order.  Even if true, which it is not, the Board of Education is not responsible for the population remaining static, or for the mobility of the races.  This was made clear in Spencer, supra, id., 326 F.Supp. at 1239, 1240, and also in Swann, supra, id., 402 U.S. at 31, 32, 91 S.Ct. 1267.

Plaintiffs cannot complain about school district lines because those lines were neutrally drawn with the incorporation of the cities long before the Negroes had migrated north in large numbers.  If school-zone lines in Detroit have not been properly drawn or if there are imbalances of black and white students, or imbalances on faculty or staffs in the Detroit schools, or if school buildings have been improperly located, or if plaintiffs have been discriminated against in any other respect, these inequities can all be remedied in the Detroit school system without forcibly moving Negroes and whites against their will across district lines into other counties and districts.  An order requiring the adoption of a metropolitan plan under the facts of this case, merely to dismantle the concentration of blacks in the inner city, violates constitutional rights of both races and constitutes a flagrant abuse of judicial power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2\" id=\"fn3-2_ref\">3</a>  Swann recognized a limitation on the power of District Judges.

Blacks are given an (alleged) benefit when other citizens \"similarly situated\", i. e., other minority-group students and even inner-city white students, are not given such benefits but are discriminated against.  This result, of course, is a classic denial of the equal protection of the laws.  Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27, 32, 5 S.Ct. 357, 28 L.Ed. 923 (1885); Truax v.

See also the discussion entitled \"Busing: A Review of 'The Evidence\"', The Public Interest No. 30 Winter 1973; \"The Evidence on Busing,\" The Public Interest No. 28 Summer 1972; Ross, \"Why Quotas Won't Work,\" Reader's Digest, Feb. 1973, p. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p684\">\n      <span class=\"num\">684</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's metropolitan cross-district order, an order purportedly directed at furthering the purposes of the equal protection clause, itself clashes with this constitutional principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p685\">\n      <span class=\"num\">685</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The metropolitan busing remedy ordered by the Court is, however, unconstitutional on a more fundamental level.  It invalidly assumes that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects groups and not individuals.  The entire thrust of the District Court's order is that the rights of blacks as a group must be redressed and that, in the process, the rights of individual black children (and non-black children) may be disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p686\">\n      <span class=\"num\">686</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consider the burden on the individual students who are bused in order to achieve a \"racial balance\" throughout the entire Detroit Metropolitan Area.  Individual black and white students who formerly walked to a nearby school would be forced to travel substantial distances to other schools.  These are not individuals who are burdened because their parents have chosen to reside far from the nearest school in the district or because they have special educational needs attended to in but a single school in the district.  These are individual children who are burdened with being bused solely because they are black or white, as the case may be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p687\">\n      <span class=\"num\">687</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parenthetically, it should be noted that if there were any question that busing involves a substantial burden on the individual who cannot attend his neighborhood school, that question has been dispelled by the urgings of desegregation-case plaintiffs that black children can not be \"unequally burdened\" by being the only students bused, the white students being permitted to attend their neighborhood schools.  See e. g., Haney v. County Bd. of Education of Sevier Co., 429 F.2d 364, 371-372 (8th Cir. 1970); Brice v.

Yet this is precisely what the District Court has held.  The Court states (correctly) that discrimination against the black race in Detroit must be remedied, but then orders massive interdistrict busing of students to achieve racial balances, denying individual blacks (and nonblacks) their right not to be substantially burdened solely on account of their race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p694\">\n      <span class=\"num\">694</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the fundamental error of the District Court order was in treating the Michigan school system as a dual system when it was not, and in proposing the dismantling of concentration of blacks in Detroit and distributing them in fiftytwo other school districts in three other counties.  Virtually all of the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs to support the District Court's rulings involved dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p695\">\n      <span class=\"num\">695</span>\n      <p>DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS OF FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE CONSTITUTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p696\">\n      <span class=\"num\">696</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, as stated by the majority, this is the fourth time that the case has been before us, the District Court has not as yet adopted any specific plan for desegregation; instead the District Court has entered a number of interlocutory orders some of which are now before us for review under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b).  These include rulings on the issue of Segregation, findings of fact and conclusions of law on Detroit Only Plan of Desegregation, propriety of a Metropolitan remedy to desegregate Detroit Schools, Desegregation Area, and Order directing Michigan State officials to purchase 295 school buses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p697\">\n      <span class=\"num\">697</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This procedure is unprecedented.  Usually school desegregation cases are reviewed on appeal only after a plan of desegregation has been adopted.  It appears to us that the District Court has placed the cart before the horse.  It has entered a number of far-reaching piecemeal interlocutory orders from which no appeal could be taken without the court's permission, and which would bring about a fait accompli of a metropolitan plan without affording the defendants their right of appeal.  This was in the absence of necessary and indispensable parties and to the prejudice of intervening school districts which had been denied effective participation in the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p698\">\n      <span class=\"num\">698</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint, which has never been amended, sought only the desegregation of the Detroit school system.  There was no allegation that any other school district would be affected.  As soon as it was determined that other school districts might be adversely affected, the District Court should have required the plaintiffs to make them parties defendant with a full opportunity to be heard on the merits of the case.  These school districts were necessary and indispensable parties.  This is the correct procedure, and was followed in Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 338 F.Supp. 67 (E.D.Va.1971), reversed on other grounds, 462 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd by equally divided Court, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S.Ct. 1952, 36 L.

They were entitled to be heard on all issues in the case which affected them, and were entitled to participate effectively in the proceedings.  They were entitled to be heard on the issues of segregation, the \"Detroit-Only plan\" and the \"Metropolitan plan\".  They had the right to offer evidence and endeavor to prove that there was no causal connection between any act or omission of the Detroit Board of Education (or of the State) and the concentration of blacks in the inner City, and that whatever constitutional violations of the rights of the plaintiffs may have occurred, such violations could be remedied within the Detroit school district without invading other districts which were not in any manner responsible for conditions in Detroit.  These rights were denied to the intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p700\">\n      <span class=\"num\">700</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the orders of the District Court on these three issues were interlocutory, the judgment entered by the majority is final and the issues may not be relitigated on remand.  Thus judgment has been entered against the absent school districts as well as those allowed to intervene, in violation of their due process rights to a fair and impartial trial.  The orders affirmed are far reaching; they will require the expenditure of untold millions, and will disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and their parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p701\">\n      <span class=\"num\">701</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in its opinion the majority did provide for amendment of pleadings on remand, making new party defendants, for intervention, and for offering additional testimony.  These provisions are wholly illusory with respect to the issues of segregation, the \"Detroit-Only plan\" and the \"Metropolitan plan\", as the opinion expressly excludes these issues from reconsideration upon the remand.  The only remedy available to the intervening school districts is to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari.  The eighteen school districts, as well as any additional school districts which the District Court may add to the desegregation area upon the remand, are without any remedy.  Since they have never been made parties, they may not petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.  They have surely been deprived of their property rights, not only without due process of law, but without any process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p702\">\n      <span class=\"num\">702</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion, with its disapproval of the \"Detroit-Only\" plan and its order to the District Court to consider and adopt a so-called \"Metropolitan\" plan invading the borders of three counties and the boundaries of fifty-two school districts, completely destroys local control of the public school system along with all of its advantages.  Local control is a traditional concept of the American public school system.  Its merit and value were recognized by the Supreme Court in two very recent decisions.  San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (decided March 21, 1973); and Wright v.

While assuring a basic education for every child in the State, it permits and encourages a large measure of participation in and control of each district's schools at the local level.  In an era that has witnessed a consistent trend toward centralization of the functions of government, local sharing of responsibility for public education has survived.  The merit of local control was recognized last Term in both the majority and dissenting opinions in Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S. Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972).  Mr. Justice Stewart stated there that '[d]irect control over decisions vitally affecting the education of one's children is a need that is strongly felt in our society.'  Id., at 469, 92 S.Ct. 2196.

Equally important, however, is the opportunity it offers for participation in the decision-making process that determines how those local tax dollars will be spent.  Each locality is free to tailor local programs to local needs.  Pluralism also affords some opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and a healthy competition for educational excellence.  An analogy to the Nation-State relationship in our federal system seems uniquely appropriate.  Mr. Justice Brandeis identified as one of the peculiar strengths of our form of government each State's freedom to 'serve as a laboratory . . . and try novel social and economic experiments.'  No area of social concern stands to profit more from a multiplicity of viewpoints and from a diversity of approaches than does public education.\"  (411 U.S. at 49, 93 S.Ct. at 1305.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p706\">\n      <span class=\"num\">706</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have pointed out, the facts of the present case furnish no basis whatsoever for the Court to destroy local control of our public school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p707\">\n      <span class=\"num\">707</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unreasonable and intolerable conditions, however, were imposed by the Court on the intervention by the school districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2\" id=\"fn6-2_ref\">6</a>  The school districts filed objections to the conditions which were never ruled on by the Court.

Less than 36 hours later the court issued its 'Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy to Accomplish Desegregation of the Public Schools of the City of Detroit' (A.

It supports the plaintiffs on the issue of a metropolitan plan contending that if a constitutional violation has been shown, only such a drastic remedy will rectify it.  It is obvious that the Detroit Board was motivated by its concern that a 63.8%-black and a 37.2%-white quota was too heavily weighted with black pupils, and that it owed a constitutional duty to dilute that quota and to distribute the black-pupil population of Detroit into the other three counties and fifty-two additional school districts, in order to effectuate a quota of about 25%-black and 75%-white children in each school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p726\">\n      <span class=\"num\">726</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is submitted that no such constitutional duty exists and that the District Court erred in ordering it; Swann, supra.THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION PROSCRIBES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p727\">\n      <span class=\"num\">727</span>\n      <p>SUITS AGAINST THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND IT HAS</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p728\">\n      <span class=\"num\">728</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have attempted to sue the State of Michigan by making the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Acting Superintendent of Schools parties defendant.

These problems arise from the existence of conflicting, fundamentally incompatible values.  On the one hand, we social workers value righting the wrongs perpetrated for too long on minority groups.  On the other hand, we value the right of all persons to be treated equally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p746\">\n      <span class=\"num\">746</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distributive justice requires the dissemination of benefits to all without depriving any individual or group of something it values.  This is far more in keeping with fairness and equity than the idea of redistributive justice, which confers benefits on one group at the expense of others.  Redistributive justice, then, leads to reverse discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p747\">\n      <span class=\"num\">747</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Redistributive justice is advocated to atone for our failure to live up to the belief in the capacity and the dignity of each human being.  This failure does not negate the soundness of that belief.  Rather, it should spur us to correct the failure-not the belief.  When practices fail to reflect principles, then we should change our practices, not our principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p748\">\n      <span class=\"num\">748</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For social workers, the issue has come to the forefront in agency and university hiring practices and admissions policies of schools of social work.  Social agencies, especially those serving ghetto populations, are giving preference to minority group members in employment.  Universities, beset by pressures from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, are similarly giving preference to women and minority groups.  Some schools of social work have adopted quota systems in dealing with candidates for admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p749\">\n      <span class=\"num\">749</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These practices conflict with the fundamental social work belief in individual human dignity and the libertarian belief that each person is entitled to be judged and valued as an individual.  Quota systems and preferential treatment are artificial restrictions on this right because they substitute irrelevant group characteristics such as race or religion for consideration of an individual's capacity and potential.  Respect for the individual is a basic part of social work's credo and commitment.  We cannot reconcile this conviction with treating people only as representatives of a racial group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p750\">\n      <span class=\"num\">750</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we try to eliminate discrimination and compensate for past wrongs by quota systems, we substitute one injustice for another.  We deny the inherent equality of all people and undermine the proposition that each individual should have the same opportunity to achieve and to be judged according to his merits.  We pit group against group and destroy the possibility of harmonious interaction.  Quotas are pernicious instruments; they represent an unacceptable means for achieving a desirable end. \"Preferential quotas are condescending, divisive and detrimental to the integrity of a university.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-3\" id=\"fn1-3_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p751\">\n      <span class=\"num\">751</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A quota system institutionalizes discrimination and must be vigorously opposed.  Ultimately, it is a form of segregation.  The progressive democratization of the university through the elimination of any criterion for admission other than merit has been one of the success stories of America.  Now some of the benighted beneficiaries of that victory ally themselves with those antilibertarian forces that would have blocked their own access to education.  They are ready to eradicate the victory of equal opportunity over discriminatory quotas, for which their forebears fought so hard.  That victory has only been partially won.  We cannot falter now by substituting a host of irrelevant and inappropriate considerations for merit.  The test a university must apply to each candidate is merit-not inherited status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p752\">\n      <span class=\"num\">752</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some advocates of quota systems believe that quotas will redress wrongs and thus produce equal opportunity, when actually they eliminate equal opportunity.  Quotas have historically been used for exclusion.  They were an insidious manifestation of institutionalized bigotry, covertly designed to exclude unwanted groups.  They were wrong in the past and they are wrong now, even though they are now designed to achieve inclusion, rather than exclusion.  Discriminatory practices are wrong, no matter what their intent.  Whether they are for or against particular groups, quota systems are morally indefensible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p753\">\n      <span class=\"num\">753</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For social workers, the distinctions among people based on race, ethnic background, religion, or creed that inhere in quota systems are particularly abhorrent.  Our regard for the individual and our objection to hereditary caste as a status determinant should make quota systems especially impossible for us to accept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p754\">\n      <span class=\"num\">754</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For schools of social work, the argument that quotas for admission will produce student bodies that represent the proportion of racial, ethnic, or religious groups in society is a curious expression of bigotry.  Proportional representation on a group basis is highly discriminatory.  What taxonomy shall be used to categorize the groups that should be represented?  Among the characteristics that defy classification are the following: cultural, economic, ethnic, gender, geographic, linguistic, national, occupational, racial, religious, social class, and tribal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p755\">\n      <span class=\"num\">755</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some minority groups include the following: the aged, American Indians, Asian-Americans, Blacks, capitalists, Catholics, Chicanos, easterners, factory workers, farmers, German-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Hungarian-Americans, immigrants, Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, Jews, the lower class, migrants, nomads, northerners, Polish-Americans, the poor, Puerto Ricans, slum-dwellers, southerners, Swedish-Americans, the upper class, wasps, westerners, and youths.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p756\">\n      <span class=\"num\">756</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Who is not a member of a minority group?

I am further in accord with the conclusion of the majority that the District Court's order for the purchase of buses for use in effectuating a plan of integration covering the metropolitan Detroit area is premature and must be stayed until an appropriate plan has been approved by the District Court.  I agree that each of the suburban school districts which may be affected by any proposed metropolitan plan is a necessary party to the litigation within the meaning of Rule 19, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as found by the majority and that the pleadings must be amended to join such school districts and bring all parties before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p763\">\n      <span class=\"num\">763</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is at this point that I separate from the majority and find myself compelled to state the reasons why I cannot join in the majority opinion.

Swann, 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554.  In determining the fact of discrimination vel non, whether imposed by statute or as a result of official action, the district court must identify the school or schools which are segregated as a result of such discrimination.  This identification must be supported by findings of fact.  The importance of such a determination will be seen in some populous school districts embracing large geographical areas.  There may be segregated schools which are the result of unconstitutional statutes or of official action.  There may be other one race schools which are the product of neutral, non-discriminatory forces.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p771\">\n      <span class=\"num\">771</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we accept the premise that \"the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy,\" as announced by the United States Supreme Court, then, clearly, the remedy proposed by the District Court, and approved by a majority of this Court, goes far beyond the \"nature of the violation\" since the District Court has already stated as a conclusion that no evidence was taken as to any violation with regard to any suburban school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p772\">\n      <span class=\"num\">772</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the minority in the Texas Education Agency case disapproved of the suggestion of the majority that specific schools within a system must be found to have been segregated, and treated separately, (476 F.2d 888 where the minority speaks through Judge Wisdom), yet the minority does not find nor even suggest that it would be appropriate to expand the order for relief beyond the system found to have committed acts which violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs in the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p773\">\n      <span class=\"num\">773</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through the majority's opinion runs the thread which holds it together.  That thread is the unwillingness apparent in the minds of the majority to sanction a black school district within a city which it concludes will be surrounded by white suburbs.  While the majority does not now state that such a demographic pattern is inherently unconstitutional, nevertheless, I am persuaded that those who subscribe to the majority opinion are convinced, as stated in the slip opinion of the original panel, \"big city school systems for blacks surrounded by suburban school systems for whites cannot represent equal protection of the law.\"  While that statement has been removed from the opinion of the majority, yet the premise upon which the statement was obviously based must necessarily form the foundation for the conclusions reached in the majority opinion.  It may be that such will become the law, but such a conclusion should not receive our approval on a record such as exists in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p774\">\n      <span class=\"num\">774</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As has been pointed out in the other opinions, the boundaries of the school district of the City of Detroit have been co-terminus with the boundaries of the City of Detroit for more than 100 years.  Those lines were laid out at a time when there was a minimal black population in the metropolitan area of Detroit, if there was such metropolitan area at the time the boundary lines were established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p775\">\n      <span class=\"num\">775</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge and the majority make much of the fact that \"if the boundary lines of the school districts of the City of Detroit and the surrounding suburbs were drawn today few would doubt that they could not withstand constitutional challenge.\"  This interesting statement provides a fertile field for speculation but certainly has no validity.  A proposal to adopt an amendment to the Constitution of the United States in the same manner and with the same people voting as adopted the Constitution of the United States would be stricken immediately.  I know of no one who would suggest that because of changes in the methods of electing the membership of state legislatures that the Constitution of the United States thereby becomes unconstitutional.  The quoted statement is to me a complete non sequitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p776\">\n      <span class=\"num\">776</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know of no authority which would permit a Court to announce a conclusion, based upon a violation of the Constitution, absent the taking of proofs to establish such constitutional violation, which proofs the District Judge stated he did not take in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p777\">\n      <span class=\"num\">777</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent proofs, which clearly were not taken, to establish a violation of the constitutional rights of these plaintiffs by the suburban school district personnel and by the State of Michigan in laying out suburban school district lines it would appear that we are in complete and absolute conflict with the prior decisions of this Court.  In Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F.2d 55 (6th Cir. 1966), cert. denied 389 U.S. 847, 88 S.Ct. 39, 19 L.Ed.2d 114 (1967) (Deal I), this Court rejected the contention that the state had an affirmative obligation to balance schools racially (in that case within the City of Cincinnati) \"to counteract the variety of private pressures that now operate to restrict the range of choices presented to each school child.\" 369 F.2d at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p778\">\n      <span class=\"num\">778</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deal I was cited with approval by this Court in Davis v.

The Court said at page 575:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p779\">\n      <span class=\"num\">779</span>\n      <p>\"Appellants correctly contend that under Deal v.

Ed.2d 114 (1967), a school district has no affirmative obligation to achieve a balance of the races in the schools when the existing imbalance is not attributable to school policies or practices and is the result of housing patterns and other forces over which the school administration had no control.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p780\">\n      <span class=\"num\">780</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority, while refusing to overrule Deal I and Davis, creates without evidence an obligation to achieve a balance of the races in schools not in a school district but in a metropolitan area, and does so while denying to the vast majority of the school districts involved in such metropolitan area the opportunity to offer evidence to establish that they had not been used for or guilty of any segregative practices.  Many other appellate courts have agreed with Deal and Davis.  Downs v. Board of Education of Kansas City, 336 F.2d 988, 998 (10th Cir. 1964):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p781\">\n      <span class=\"num\">781</span>\n      <p>\"Appellants also contend that even though the Board may not be pursuing a policy of intentional segregation, there is still segregation in fact in the school system and under the principles of Brown v. Board of Education, supra, the Board has a positive and affirmative duty to eliminate segregation in fact as well as segregation by intention.  While there seems to be authority to support that contention, the better rule is that although the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits segregation, it does not command integration of the races in the public schools and Negro children have no constitutional right to have white children attend school with them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p782\">\n      <span class=\"num\">782</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keyes v.

We never construed Brown to prohibit racially imbalanced schools provided they are established and maintained on racially neutral criteria, and neither have other circuits considering the issue.

Kugler, 326 F.Supp. 1235 (D.N.J. 1971), and was rejected.  The Supreme Court affirmed without opinion, 404 U.

Again it may be that this will become the law.  Clearly, the cases cited have reached this conclusion as to the attendance lines existing within a specific school system.  I know of no case which permits such a conclusion as to boundary lines existing between school districts, and while the conclusion that existing boundary lines cannot be frozen for an unconstitutional purpose may flow logically from the premise announced it should be based upon competent evidence justifying a finding of fact that such boundary lines have been frozen for an unconstitutional purpose, and the District Judge in this case announced that he took no evidence on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p789\">\n      <span class=\"num\">789</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not understand how the majority can reach a conclusion as to an appropriate remedy without evidence of any violation, particularly when in Deal I and Deal II a contrary conclusion has been reached.

Clearly, if the Court took no proofs with respect to the commission of acts causing segregation of the races as between the City of Detroit and the suburban school districts it would be inappropriate to include those school districts within any remedy to be adopted to eliminate segregation within the City of Detroit.  The cases cited by the District Court and by the majority of this Court are inapplicable.  In each case cited the school district involved and against which a remedial order was granted was found to have been guilty of segregative practices.  In every instance, as we read the cases, that finding was supported by substantial evidence after an adversary proceeding in which all the interested parties were represented.  Such is not the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p798\">\n      <span class=\"num\">798</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems obvious to me that the majority and the District Court have become confused and are unable to distinguish between violation and remedy.  As stated by the District Court no evidence was taken as to any violation in the fixing of the boundaries of the suburban school systems nor as to any violation because of the relationship between the suburban school systems and the schools of the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p799\">\n      <span class=\"num\">799</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The errors to which we have already alluded were brought about by the failure on the part of the District Court to require that all interested parties be brought into the case at the earliest appropriate moment.  A review of this record reveals that on March 22, 1971, a group of white Detroit residents, who were parents of children enrolled in the Detroit public schools, were permitted to intervene as parties defendant.  On June 24, 1971, the District Judge alluded to the possibility of a metropolitan school system, App.  Vol. IV, pgs. 259, 260, and in that connection stated: \"As I have said to several witnesses in this case: how do you desegregate a black city, or a black school system.\"  App. Vol.  IV, pg. 260.  Subsequently, and on July 17, 1971, the white parents filed a motion in an effort to require the joinder of the 85 suburban school districts as parties defendant and gave the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p800\">\n      <span class=\"num\">800</span>\n      <p>\"1. That said suburban school districts are agents of the State of Michigan and subject to the jurisdiction and supervision of the State Board of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p801\">\n      <span class=\"num\">801</span>\n      <p>\"2.

In the event that this Court rules for the plaintiff, in the absence of joinder of the proposed school districts, complete relief cannot be awarded the plaintiff, and in addition would impose an unconstitutional burden on the intervening defendant, in that the resulting school district of the City of Detroit would be and will remain as established by the proofs already submitted an inferior school district.\"  App. I at 142-3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p804\">\n      <span class=\"num\">804</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court did not rule upon this motion, but in the course of the proceedings discussed it in September, 1971, and concluded that the motion should not be considered at that time because \"in considering the motion to add the listed school districts we pause to note that the proposed action has to do with relief.\"  App. Vol.  I, pg. 215, 338 F.

These motions were finally granted on March 15, 1972, during the second day of hearing on the plans for desegregation involving only the Detroit school system.  Intervention, according to the District Judge, was permitted under Rule 24(a), \"Intervention of Right,\" and also under Rule 24(b), \"Permissive Intervention.\"  Before permitting such intervention and on March 6, 1972, the District Judge set up a timetable for the consideration of plans already submitted, which timetable was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p806\">\n      <span class=\"num\">806</span>\n      <p>\"1.

With regard to the examination of witnesses, all new intervenors shall among themselves select one attorney per witness to act for them, unless one or more of the new intervenors show cause otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p820\">\n      <span class=\"num\">820</span>\n      <p>These conditions of intervention shall remain subject to change or modification by the court in the interest of timely disposition of the case.\"  App. Ia 408-410.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p821\">\n      <span class=\"num\">821</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We point out that the intervening school districts (42 out of 85) came into the case while the court was already considering the Detroit only plans, were permitted a total of less than one week to prepare briefs in regard to a metropolitan remedy, and found themselves faced with a ruling favorable to the consideration of such remedy within two days after the date on which their briefs were due.  All of this despite the fact that an effort had been made to bring the suburban school districts into the case almost eight months prior to the rulings in regard to the Detroit only plans and the metropolitan plan.  The majority finds no fault with this timetable.  It affirms the conclusions of the District Court in regard to the Detroit only plan and the need for a metropolitan plan without affording to the suburban school districts any opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p822\">\n      <span class=\"num\">822</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those suburban school districts which are not yet parties to this action, 43 in number, have had no opportunity to be heard with respect to any alleged constitutional violation within their respective school districts or with respect to the existence of their respective school district boundaries.  Of course, the pleadings do not assert any such violations but under the majority opinion a remedy will be imposed which will drastically affect the future schooling of their children without granting to them any opportunity to be heard with regard to any reasons which might support the adoption of such a remedy.  The suburban school districts which were belatedly made parties to this action assert that because they have not been afforded the opportunity to offer evidence to demonstrate that they have not been guilty of any constitutional violation they have been denied the fundamental requirements of due process.  The response of the appellee to the claimed rights of the suburban school districts is that there is no denial of \"life, liberty or property\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  They also claim that the interests of the suburban school districts were adequately represented by \"their parent state defendant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p823\">\n      <span class=\"num\">823</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the record in this case will effectively dispose of any claim that the interests of the suburban school districts were represented by the state defendants.  Clearly, the state defendants were defending against the claims of the plaintiffs that the state had by its actions created racial segregation within the school district of the City of Detroit.  As I examine the record it does not appear that any defendant felt compelled to offer evidence in defense of an unasserted claim that the existence of suburban school districts was without other evidence a violation of the constitutional rights of the students in the schools of the City of Detroit.  Had the state defendants comprehended that the District Court intended to impose a metropolitan school district upon the schools of three counties the writer is confident that they would have joined in the earlier motion to require the suburban school districts to be named as parties defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p824\">\n      <span class=\"num\">824</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first argument of the appellees it is clear from the language of the Court in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954), that the segregation of schools is a denial of due process within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  If segregation is a denial of the Fifth Amendment due process then clearly orders eliminating such segregation are a part of the due process rights.  In that case the Court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p825\">\n      <span class=\"num\">825</span>\n      <p>\"Although the Court has not assumed to define 'liberty' with any great precision, that term is not confined to mere freedom from bodily restraint.  Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, * * *.\" 347 U.S. at 499, 74 S.Ct. at 694.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p826\">\n      <span class=\"num\">826</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even earlier, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), the Supreme Court found a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in matters relating to the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.  Had we any doubt, it would have been settled in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972), where the Court permitted parents to withdraw their children from the state public school system and found a constitutional right in parents to control the upbringing and religious training of their children.  That the right under the Fifth Amendment applies to the states was recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, at page 482, 85 S.Ct. 1678 at page 1680, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), where the court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p827\">\n      <span class=\"num\">827</span>\n      <p>\"By Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, the right to educate one's children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p828\">\n      <span class=\"num\">828</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Being convinced that the interest of parents in the education of their children represents a right protected by the Constitution as to all parents and not only those parents whose children are required to attend segregated schools, we then reach the question of the application of due process to that right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p829\">\n      <span class=\"num\">829</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As pointed out by the Court in Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p830\">\n      <span class=\"num\">830</span>\n      <p>\"A fundamental requirement of due process is 'the opportunity to be heard.' * * *  It is an opportunity which must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p831\">\n      <span class=\"num\">831</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">and in greater detail we find the same principal in Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 377-378, 91 S.Ct. 780, 785, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), where Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p832\">\n      <span class=\"num\">832</span>\n      <p>\"Prior cases establish, first, that due process requires, at a minimum, that absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  Early in our jurisprudence, this Court voiced the doctrine that '[w]herever one is assailed in his person or his property, there he may defend,' Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274, 277, 23 L.Ed. 914 (1876).  See Baldwin v. Hale, 1 Wall. 223, 17 L.Ed. 531 (1864); Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409, 17 S.Ct. 841, 42 L.Ed. 215 (1897).  The theme that 'due process of law signifies a right to be heard in one's defense,' Hovey v. Elliott, supra, at 417, 17 S. Ct. 841, has continually recurred in the years since Baldwin, Windsor, and Hovey.  Although '[m]any controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause,' as Mr. Justice Jackson wrote for the Court in Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), 'there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\"'  Id., at 313, 70 S.Ct. 656.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p833\">\n      <span class=\"num\">833</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, each party to a lawsuit should be advised as to the claims asserted by the other parties to the lawsuit and have an opportunity to be heard in respect to all such claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p834\">\n      <span class=\"num\">834</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case no pleading has ever been filed suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of any suburban school district, none suggesting that the suburban schools and the schools of the City of Detroit constituted a dual school system or even intimating any possibility of a need for a metropolitan school district to eliminate the segregated conditions alleged to have existed in the schools of the City of Detroit.  We can only speculate upon the timing of the first suggestion of a metropolitan district but it appears that the District Judge seized upon the suggestion without requiring any amendments to the pleadings or the adding of any parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p835\">\n      <span class=\"num\">835</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I question whether the suburban school districts have any interest in being heard as to the claim of segregation within the City of Detroit, and there can be no question as to the right of the trial court to place certain limitations upon the part which any intervening school district would be permitted to play.  Had all of this, in regard to metropolitan school districts, come up at the eleventh hour as suggested by the appellees one might, although it is doubtful, accept the conditions imposed by the District Judge.  Such was not the case here.  The motion to require the joinder of the suburban school districts was made almost eight months before consideration was given to the Detroit only plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p836\">\n      <span class=\"num\">836</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Committee on the Rules anticipated that limitations and conditions might be placed upon intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p837\">\n      <span class=\"num\">837</span>\n      <p>\"An intervention of right under the amended rule may be subject to appropriate conditions or restrictions responsive among other things to the requirements of efficient conduct of the proceedings.\" 3B Moore's Federal Practice p 24.01 , at 24-18 (2d Ed.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p838\">\n      <span class=\"num\">838</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">and see also Galbreath v.

The situation in this case is pointed up by the language found at 3B Moore's Federal Practice p 24.16 , 2d Ed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p839\">\n      <span class=\"num\">839</span>\n      <p>\"It would be meaningless to give him an absolute right to intervene in order to protect his interest, if once in the proceeding he were barred from raising questions necessary to his own protection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p840\">\n      <span class=\"num\">840</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said in regard to intervention under Rule 24 sets forth without the necessity of repetition those matters which should be considered by any court in determining the part which is to be played by one who is joined as a party under Rule 19, as well as one who intervenes as a party, aspects of this case which are almost completely ignored by the majority and the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p841\">\n      <span class=\"num\">841</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion I am constrained to say that I do not suggest that a metropolitan remedy is totally beyond the realm of consideration in this case upon an appropriate record.  My whole purpose in writing this opinion is to point out that the majority and the District Court have fallen into a state of confusion in failing to distinguish between violation and remedy and in failing to recognize the necessity for the finding of violation before the trial court embarks upon that broad field of equity which permits a trial judge to devise a remedy which will adequately overcome the violation previously found to be in existence.  I have also written because I am satisfied that the District Judge in failing to consider the necessity for joining the suburban school districts pursuant to a motion filed more than a year before the disposition of the case was in error.  The suggestion by the District Court that the suburban school districts were only involved in the remedy points up the trap into which both the District Court and the majority of this Court have fallen in failing to recognize the necessity for finding a violation before a remedy may be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p842\">\n      <span class=\"num\">842</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the District Court and remand the case with instructions to require the joinder of the suburban school districts of the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb with permission to the representatives of those districts, with reasonable limitations, to participate in all aspects of this lawsuit which may affect the suburban school districts, and with particular attention to the necessity for finding a constitutional violation which would justify the imposition of a metropolitan remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p843\">\n      <span class=\"num\">843</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WILLIAM E. MILLER, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p844\">\n      <span class=\"num\">844</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is my firm conviction that it is premature at this time for the Court to adjudicate any of the questions arising from the various orders of the district court from which this appeal is taken.  This is true for the reason that school districts and parties to be affected by a metropolitan plan or remedy have not been afforded an opportunity to be heard or to present evidence upon all of the issues involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion does indeed state:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p845\">\n      <span class=\"num\">845</span>\n      <p>On remand, any party against whom relief is sought, including school districts which heretofore have intervened and school districts which hereafter may become parties to this litigation, shall be afforded an opportunity to offer additional evidence, and to cross-examine available witnesses who previously have testified, on any issue raised by the pleadings, including amendments thereto, as may be relevant and admissible to such issues.  The District Court may consider any evidence now on file and such additional competent evidence as may be introduced by any party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p846\">\n      <span class=\"num\">846</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of this conclusion is, in my opinion, vitiated by the two succeeding sentences:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p847\">\n      <span class=\"num\">847</span>\n      <p>However, the District Court will not be required to receive any additional evidence as to the matters contained in its Ruling on the Issue of Segregation, dated September 27, 1971, and reported at 338 F.Supp. 582, or its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on the \"Detroit-only\" plans of desegregation, dated March 28, 1972.  We hold that the findings of fact contained in these rulings are not clearly erroneous, Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., but to the contrary are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p848\">\n      <span class=\"num\">848</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties to be affected and against whom relief is sought should be accorded, in compliance with basic principles of due process, an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner not only with respect to the ultimate scope of the remedy to be fashioned, but also with respect to important, significant and perhaps even controlling issues, including the issue of segregation, a \"Detroit only\" school plan and the propriety of a metropolitan remedy.  If any one of these issues is resolved in favor of parties outside the Detroit School District, the nature and scope of a remedy embracing outlying districts would not be reached.  Hence the outlying districts have a vital interest in each issue separately and should be heard on each in a true adversary sense.  Until this is done our expression of view on the merits of the several questions is uncalled for and ill-advised.  To permit these additional parties to be heard only in the restricted sense set forth in the majority opinion is to deny them basic rights guaranteed not only by Rule 19, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but by the Constitution itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p849\">\n      <span class=\"num\">849</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would, therefore, vacate all orders appealed from the district court, remand the action for the joinder of all parties to be affected, and direct the district court to afford the parties a proper opportunity to be heard and to present evidence on the issues indicated above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>\"1.

Both District Court decisions, although inconsistent, have now been affirmed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Indeed, there is no finding by the District Court of any pattern of purposeful segregation by the School Board or finding of any causal relationship between any alleged segregative acts of the Board of Education and the concentration of blacks in the inner city</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-3_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At the National Black Political Convention held in Gary, Indiana (March, 1972), mandatory busing and school integration were condemned as racist and as preserving a black minority structure</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-3_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Of course, merely because equal protection is an individual right does not mean, as implied in United States v.

A class action lies where a number of persons have similar individual rights infringed</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, it does not follow that simply because a class action is available to redress discrimination individual rights can be obliterated by superimposing the \"rights\" of the class.</p>\n        <p>The individual plaintiffs, who charge in their Complaint the maintenance of a desegregated school system in Detroit, were all Negroes except one.  Nevertheless, the District Court in determining the class held \"that the plaintiffs in their action represent all school children in the City of Detroit, Michigan, and all Detroit resident parents who have children of school age, . . ..\" Thus white and black children and their parents, who are not situated similarly with the plaintiffs and may violently disagree with plaintiffs' position, are arbitrarily placed in the same class.  It will also be noted that the Complaint sought only the desegregation of the Detroit schools and made no claim against other counties and other school districts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> \"The interventions granted this day shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> No intervenor will be permitted to assert any claim or defense previously adjudicated by the court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> No intervenor shall reopen any question or issue which has previously been decided by the court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The participation of the intervenors considered this day shall be subordinated to that of the original parties and previous intervenors</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">4</a>\n        <p> The new intervenors shall not initiate discovery proceedings except by permission of the court upon application in writing, accompanied by a showing that no present party plans to or is willing to undertake the particular discovery sought and that the particular matter to be discovered is relevant to the current stage of the proceedings</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">5</a>\n        <p> No new intervenor shall be permitted to seek a delay of any proceeding in this cause; and he shall be bound by the brief and hearing schedule established by the court's Notice to Counsel, issued March 6, 1972</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">6</a>\n        <p> New intervenors will not file counterclaims or cross-complaints; nor will they be permitted to seek the joinder of additional parties or the dismissal of present parties, except upon a showing that such action will not result in delay</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-2_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> New intervenors are granted intervention for two principal purposes: (a) To advise the court, by brief, of the legal propriety or impropriety of considering a metropolitan plan; (b) to review any plan or plans for the desegregation of the so-called larger Detroit Metropolitan area, and submitting objections, modifications or alternatives to it or them, and in accordance with the requirements of the United States Constitution and the prior orders of this court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-2_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> New intervenors shall present evidence, if any they have, through witnesses to a number to be set, and limited, if necessary, by the court, following conference</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">9</a>\n        <p> With regard to the examination of witnesses, all new intervenors shall among themselves select one attorney per witness to act for them, unless one or more of the new intervenors show cause otherwise.

CHRONOLOGY OF PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan to effect a more balanced distribution of black and white students in the senior high schools through enactment of changes in attendance zones involving some 12,000 pupils, to become effective over a three year period.  Three months later this modest effort was thwarted by the legislature of the State of Michigan through enactment of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970.  Section 12 of the Act delayed implementation of the plan.  The four members of the Board who supported the April 7 plan were removed from office through a citizen initiated recall election.  The new members of the Board and the incumbent members who had orginally opposed the April 7 plan thereafter rescinded it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in this case was filed by individual black and white school children and their parents, and the Detroit branch of the NAACP against the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, its members, and the then Superintendent of Schools, as well as the Governor, the Attorney General, the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Michigan.  (The State of Michigan as such is not a party to this litigation.  References thereto should be read as references to the public officials, State and local, through whom the State is alleged or shown to have acted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleged that the Detroit public school system was and is segregated on the basis of race as the result of actions and policies of the Board of Education and of the State of Michigan.  The complaint specifically challenged the constitutionality of Act 48 of the Public Acts of 1970 of the State of Michigan, which in effect repealed the April 7, 1970 high school desegregation plan formulated by the Detroit Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was heard originally on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of Act 48.  In response to this motion the District Judge denied a preliminary injunction, did not rule on the constitutionality of Act 48, but granted the motion of the Governor and Attorney General of Michigan for dismissal of the cause as to them.  On appeal this court held that Sec. 12 of Act 48 was an unconstitutional interference with the lawful protection of Fourteenth Amendment rights, that there was no abuse of discretion in denying a preliminary injunction, and that the Governor and Attorney General should not have been dismissed as parties defendant at that stage of the proceeding.  The case was remanded to the District Court for an expedited trial on the merits. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"292940\"><a href=\"/opinion/292940/ronald-bradley-v-william-g-milliken-governor-of-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand plaintiffs moved for immediate implementation of the April 7 plan.  On December 3, 1970, following an evidentiary hearing on that plan and two updated plans, the District Court ordered implementation of the \"Magnet\" or \"McDonald\" plan effective at the beginning of the next full school year, pending ultimate disposition on the merits.  Plaintiffs appealed and filed a motion for summary reversal.  This court again held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to adopt the April 7 plan prior to an evidentiary hearing on the allegations of constitutional violations in the complaint.

An effort was made to appeal these orders to this court.

The Board admits at least one instance where it purposefully and intentionally built and maintained a school and its attendance zone to contain black students.  Throughout the last decade (and presently) school attendance zones of opposite racial compositions have been separated by north-south boundary lines, despite the Board's awareness (since at least 1962) that drawing boundary lines in an east-west direction would result in significant integration.  The natural and actual effect of these acts and failures to act has been the creation and perpetuation of school segregation.  There has never been a feeder pattern or zoning change which placed a predominantly white residential area into a predominately black school zone or feeder pattern.  Every school which was 90% or more black in 1960, and which is still in use today, remains 90% or more black.\" 338 F.Supp. at 588.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal conclusion of the District Judge is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>\"5.

We feel it is significant as it represents an attempt on the part of people who make up this organization to effectively deal with the frustrations historically inherent in attempting to provide for minority group children an adequate education within the Detroit Public School System.  A majority of the people of the Negro race moved into the now Center District from other school districts within the limits of the City of Detroit.  Although better housing conditions were but one of the motives for such a move, of equal importance was a desire to provide their children with a more equitable and enriched educational experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'They were aware of the increased population within their new geographical area, and accepted the counselling of the then new administration of the Board of Education, to the effect that additional tax monies would have to be made available if educational standards within the City of Detroit were to be improved, or even maintained.  Consequently, each of them made a strong personal investment in the millage compaign of Spring 1959.  In this campaign, initially, their efforts did not meet the wholehearted approval of the Negro community, since from past experience, particularly involving other millage campaigns, members of the Negro community had observed that the results of the expenditures of monies obtained from additional taxes, had little effect on the facilities, the equipment, or the curriculum available to their children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Despite this resistance, they were aware that there would be less justification for demanding adequate educational opportunities for their children if they did not accept their responsible share for the successful passing of the millage program.  As a consequence of their efforts, their respective schools voted overwhelmingly for the millage program, and they logically expected that positive results would follow their efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Their first disillusionment occurred only a few months, but yet a few weeks after the passage of the millage-they were rewarded with the creation of the present Center District.  In effect this District, with a few minor exceptions, created a segregated school system.  It accomplished with a few marks of the crayon on the map, the return of the Negro child from the few instances of an integrated school exposure, to the traditional predominantly uniracial school system to which he had formerly been accustomed in the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Their attempts to meet this threat to their children's educational experience through existing school organizations met with little success.  Their conferences with District and City-Wide administrators including the superintendent, Dr. Samuel Brownell, resulted in only rationalizations concerning segregated housing patterns, and denials of any attempts at segregation.  When it was pointed out that regardless of motivation, that segregation was the result of their boundary changes, little compromise was effected, except in one or two instances, where opposition leadership was most vocal and aggressive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Concurrent with boundary changes, it was alarmingly noticeable that the school population within the Center District was rapidly increasing, and that the priority building program would have little positive effect in dealing with the problem.  Attempts to discuss this problem with school and district administration gave promise of only minimal relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Finally, it had been earlier noted by new residents moving into what is now the Center District that prior to and during its change from a uniracial (predominatly white) to a biracial system and again to a uniracial (predominatly Negro) school system that the quality of their children's previous educational experiences did not equip them to compete on an equal basis with resident children in the same grade and classifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'These experiences made them aware that no one organization composed of one or several schools, could effectively coordinate the mutual concern of the many parents residing within the Center District.  Thus out of the several discussions of groups of people whose primary concern was the adequate and equitable education of their children, this organization was born.  It is felt that no better description of its purpose, its objective, and its reason for being can be found than in the preamble to its Constitution, which is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'PREAMBLE: Our interest is in equal educational opportunities for all persons within the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We do not believe that such opportunities are possible within a segregated school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We oppose a policy of containment of minority groups within specified boundaries, an example of which is the Center District.  While the above is of utmost concern to us we are also aware that there is need for improvement and enrichment of the standards within this district in practice as well as in theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We believe that once standards have become reasonably adequate, that such standards should be maintained.  It should be further recognized that future population shifts brought about by urban redevelopment will adversely affect the above goals in the Center District, unless there is anticipation of the impact of this population growth upon this district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Since the inception of our organization we have noted the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The public school system of the City of Detroit is divided into nine administrative districts, one of which is the Center District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Yet, every day, when the children in this city leave their homes to go forth to public schools, approximately one out of every four leaves a home in the Center District.  Of the 154,969 children enrolled in public elementary schools as of September 30, 1960, 36,264 or 23.4 percent of these children leave a home in the Center District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'There are 221 elementary school buildings in the Detroit Public School System.

In other words, their capacities are overtaxed to the extent of 16 percent; and the future building program, as set forth by the superintendent's report of October 17, 1960, will make available only 11,189 additional pupil stations within the next ten-year period.  However, this will be insufficient to meet the demands of the Center District.

(By Mr. Lucas) Doctor, I understand that the policy of the district is that bussing to relieve overcrowding would be done in such a manner as to improve integration at the receiving school.  From your examination of the current bussing examples which you have given, do you have an opinion as to whether or not that policy has or has not been followed?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A. Well, I think from the examples I have given so far it would give an indication that integration could have been effected in a much better way if the children, instead of going to the schools would have been dropped off at other schools where the racial balance was quite different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. Are there any white schools from your examination of data, Doctor Foster, between Angell and Higginbotham which had capacity at that time?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A. Yes, there were several which were a good deal closer to Angell than Higginbotham.  The effect of this sort of zoning pattern was to provide segregated student ratios at all three of the elementary schools, and in terms of things that could be done or could have been done at that particular time to correct the segregated situation, it is my opinion that, first of all, the students being bussed from Angell could have been dropped off at any number of places on the way to Higginbotham, schools which had the space and had a better racial composition for this sort of input.  This having been done, zone lines could have been redrawn at these three schools to have approached a racial balance situation which, in my opinion, would have helped to stabilize the situation at that time.  This would have also assisted in the overcrowding at Pasteur and a couple of classrooms extra at Higginbotham.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q.

Well, it is obvious that if you transport black children past white schools to an all black school that the community is going to perceive this as a segregated intent, a segregated action.  If you have a boundary situation which isolates and enforces black students to a particular area when the boundary lines could be changed to effectuate a better pattern racially, then it seems to me that community perception would also be that the school is not doing what it could in terms of integration and equal opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q.

For many years the record indicates this practice to have been pervasive.  It continued in at least one instance up to the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to optional attendance zones, the District Judge found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p>\"During the decade beginning in 1950 the Board created and maintained optional attendance zones in neighborhoods undergoing racial transition and between high school attendance areas of opposite predominant racial compositions.  In 1959 there were eight basic optional attendance areas affecting 21 schools.  Optional attendance areas provided pupils living within certain elementary areas a choice of attendance at one of two high schools.  In addition there was at least one optional area either created or existing in 1960 between two junior high schools of opposite predominant racial components.  All of the high school optional areas, except two, were in neighborhoods undergoing racial transition (from white to black) during the 1950s.  The two exceptions were: (1) the option between Southwestern (61.6% black in 1960) and Western (15.3% black); (2) the option between Denby (0% black) and Southeastern (30.9% black).  With the exception of the Denby-Southeastern option (just noted) all of the options were between high schools of opposite predominant racial compositions.  The Southwestern-Western and Denby-Southeastern optional areas are all white on the 1950, 1960 and 1970 census maps.  Both Southwestern and Southeastern, however, had substantial white pupil populations, and the option allowed whites to escape integration.  The natural, probable, foreseeable and actual effect of these optional zones was to allow white youngsters to escape identifiably 'black' schools.  There had also been an optional zone (eliminated between 1956 and 1959) created in 'an attempt . . . to separate Jews and Gentiles within the system,' the effect of which was that Jewish youngsters went to Mumford High School and Gentile youngsters went to Cooley.  Although many of these optional areas had served their purpose by 1960 due to the fact that most of the areas had become predominantly black, one optional area (Southwestern-Western affecting Wilson Junior High graduates) continued until the present school year (and will continue to effect 11th and 12th grade white youngsters who elected to escape from predominantly black Southwestern to predominantly white Western High School).  Mr. Henrickson, the Board's general fact witness, who was employed in 1959 to, inter alia, eliminate optional areas, noted in 1967 that: 'In operation Western appears to be still the school to which white students escape from predominantly Negro surrounding schools.'  The effect of eliminating this optional area (which affected only 10th graders for the 1970-71 school year) was to decrease Southwestern from 86.7% black in 1969 to 74.3% black in 1970.\" 338 F.

If you have, let's say, two high school districts, District X and District Y, frequently when you set up an optional zone you carve the zone out of one district, occasionally two, but assume we carve it out of District Y and the children in this optional zone are then permitted to go to either high school X or high school Y, this becomes in a sense an overlapping zone because if we refer to the boundaries of school District X at this point it not only includes the previous boundary but also takes in the optional zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p>\"District Y in turn would include its previous boundaries, also including the optional zone.

Sometimes these are set up for socio-economic reasons and I have on occasion seen them set up by boards of superintendents as political gimicks in order to help pass a bond issue or one thing or another or a school board or superintendent will set up temporary optional zones as a favor to certain constitutents in return for assistance in helping the school board with one thing or another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p>\"I think in the framework in which we operate they are used primarily for maintaining segregated patterns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p274\">\n      <span class=\"num\">274</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p275\">\n      <span class=\"num\">275</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p276\">\n      <span class=\"num\">276</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

Dr. Porter, is there some formula in terms of distance which makes a child eligible for transportation that would be aided by the state?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p435\">\n      <span class=\"num\">435</span>\n      <p>\"A. Yes.  It is a very complicated formula that 197 computations, and we are in the process right now of reducing this-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p436\">\n      <span class=\"num\">436</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

A mile and a half outside the city limits.  Until this year the legislature amended the Act based upon the recommendations of the State Board of Education to allow for incity transportation which we had never had before.  The legislature did not appropriate funds for that.  So, now the funds that are now used are basically for rural areas and suburban areas where the students live a mile and a half from the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p438\">\n      <span class=\"num\">438</span>\n      <p>\"Q. When you say 'city,' is there some limitation?

Well, I think my question may have been confusing.  Is there some type of city-is it just any place incorporated as a city that is differentiated from the rural areas, or certain cities eligible for this state aid at the present time and receive the funds-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p441\">\n      <span class=\"num\">441</span>\n      <p>\"THE COURT: I think what Mr. Lucas is trying to get at is whether under the old practice whether any city has ceased state aid for transportation within the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p442\">\n      <span class=\"num\">442</span>\n      <p>\"A. Yes, we have a number of instances where the city would be receiving aid for transportation, because the law says that if the bus in order to get the students to the school crosses outside of the city boundary, the city is then eligible for aid, and we, and we have a number of instances where that exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p443\">\n      <span class=\"num\">443</span>\n      <p>\"THE COURT: In other words, where the student originates his ride outside the city limits transportation is assisted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p444\">\n      <span class=\"num\">444</span>\n      <p>\"A. That's right, or where the student lives in the city but the bus has to go outside of the city and come back he is also eligible.  This, however, does not negate local city officials, school board officials from providing transportation.  There is no prohibition against that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p445\">\n      <span class=\"num\">445</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

The law was changed last year to permit in-city bus transportation but in changing the law the legislature said our department had to disburse the funds to the eligible existing areas which meant that since they did not increase the amount of funds appropriated we could not provide for in-city transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p447\">\n      <span class=\"num\">447</span>\n      <p>\"Q.

That is correct, or any other area.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p451\">\n      <span class=\"num\">451</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clearest example of direct State participation in encouraging the segregated condition of Detroit public schools, however, is that of school construction in Detroit and the surrounding suburban areas.  Until 1962 the State Board of Education had direct statutory control over site planning for new school construction.  During that time, as was pointed out above, the State approved school construction which fostered segregation throughout the Detroit Metropolitan area.  (See supra pp. 235-239).  Since 1962 the State Board has continued to be involved in approval of school construction plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p452\">\n      <span class=\"num\">452</span>\n      <p>IV. Conclusion as to Constitutional Violations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p453\">\n      <span class=\"num\">453</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discriminatory practices on the part of the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan revealed by this record are significant, pervasive and causally related to the substantial amount of segregation found in the Detroit school system by the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p454\">\n      <span class=\"num\">454</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, of course, a significant distinction between this record and those school segregation cases which have flooded the courts since Brown v. Topeka, infra.  This distinction is that Michigan has never enforced segregation by State laws which provided for separate black and white school systems, as was the pattern prior to 1954 in many other States.  As a consequence, there always have been some instances of actual school integration in Detroit and still more instances of token school integration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p455\">\n      <span class=\"num\">455</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants seek to insulate themselves from remedial action by federal courts by pointing to the long standing public policy of Michigan, as expressed in its statutes, of integration of public education.  However, this court is not blind to the fact that governments can act only through the conduct of their officials and employees and that unconstitutional actions of individuals can be redressed.

Hearings were had on said plans on March 14, 15, 16, 17 and 21, 1972.  In considering these plans the court does not limit itself to the proofs offered at the hearing just concluded; it considers as part of the evidence bearing on the issue (i. e., City-Only Plans) all proofs submitted in the case to this point, and it specifically incorporates herein by reference the Findings and Conclusions contained in its \"Ruling on Issue of Segregation,\" filed September 27, 1971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p465\">\n      <span class=\"num\">465</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The court makes the following factual findings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p466\">\n      <span class=\"num\">466</span>\n      <p>\"PLAN A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p467\">\n      <span class=\"num\">467</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"1. The court finds that this plan is an elaboration and extension of the socalled Magnet Plan, previously authorized for implementation as an interim plan pending hearing and determination on the issue of segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p468\">\n      <span class=\"num\">468</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"2. As proposed we find, at the high school level, that it offers a greater and wider degree of specialization, but any hope that it would be effective to desegregate the public schools of the City of Detroit at that level is virtually ruled out by the failure of the current model to achieve any appreciable success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p469\">\n      <span class=\"num\">469</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"3. We find, at the Middle School level, that the expanded model would affect, directly, about 24,000 pupils of a total of 140,000 in the grades covered; and its effect would be to set up a school system within the school system, and would intensify the segregation in schools not included in the Middle School program.  In this sense, it would increase segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p470\">\n      <span class=\"num\">470</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"4.

The plan would require the development of transportation on a vast scale which, according to the evidence, could not be furnished, ready for operation by the opening of the 1972-73 school year.  The plan contemplates the transportation of 82,000 pupils and would require the acquisition of some 900 vehicles, the hiring and training of a great number of drivers, the procurement of space for storage and maintenance, the recruitment of maintenance and the not negligible task of designing a transportation system to service the schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p478\">\n      <span class=\"num\">478</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"4.

It would change a school system which is now Black and White to one that would be perceived as Black, thereby increasing the flight of Whites from the city and the system, thereby increasing the Black student population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p483\">\n      <span class=\"num\">483</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"9.

Plaintiffs' Plan, while it would provide a racial mix more in keeping with the Black-White proportions of the student population than under either of the Board's plans or as the system now stands, would accentuate the racial identifiability of the district as a Black school system, and would not accomplish desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p490\">\n      <span class=\"num\">490</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"5. The conclusion, under the evidence in this case, is inescapable that relief of segregation in the public schools of the City of Detroit cannot be accomplished within the corporate geographical limits of the city.  The State, however, cannot escape its constitutional duty to desegregate the public schools of the City of Detroit by pleading local authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p491\">\n      <span class=\"num\">491</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p492\">\n      <span class=\"num\">492</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p493\">\n      <span class=\"num\">493</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"School district lines are simply matters of political convenience and may not be used to deny constitutional rights.  If the boundary lines of the school districts of the City of Detroit and the surrounding suburbs were drawn today few would doubt that they could not withstand constitutional challenge.  In seeking for solutions to the problem of school segregation, other federal courts have not \"treated as immune from intervention the administrative structure of a state's educational system, to the extent that it affects the capacity to desegregate.  Geographically or administratively independent units have been compelled to merge or to initiate or continue cooperative operation as a single system for school desegregation purposes.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p494\">\n      <span class=\"num\">494</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"That the court must look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a solution to the problem of segregation in the Detroit public schools is obvious; that it has the authority, nay more, the duty to (under the circumstances of this case) do so appears plainly anticipated by Brown II,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> seventeen years ago.

This record presents a wholly new fact pattern in a school segregation case so far as this Circuit is concerned.

When Public Act 289 became effective, 1,438 public school districts existed in Michigan.  By the beginning of 1968, this figure had been reduced to 738, meaning that 700 school districts in Michigan have disappeared since 1964 through reorganization.

Pursuant to Act 289 of 1964, supra, the State Board of Education ordered the merger of the Brownstown No. 10, Hand, Maple Grove and Carson school districts, all in Wayne County.

The State of Michigan contributes, on the average, 34% of the operating budgets of the 54 school districts included in the proposed Metropolitan Plan of Integration.  In eleven of the 54 districts, the State's contribution exceeds 50% and in eight more, it exceeds 40%.  State aid is appropriated from the General Fund, revenue raised through state-wide taxation, and is distributed annually to the local school districts under a formula devised by the legislature.  See, e. g., Public Act 134 (1971), M.S.A. Sec. 15.1919(51), M.C.L.A.

The State's duty to equalize is required by the Michigan Constitution, Article IX, Section 3. This \"State equalized valuation\" serves as the basis for calculating local revenue yields.

In the instant case the only feasible desegregation plan involves the crossing of the boundary lines between the Detroit School District and adjacent or nearby school districts for the limited purpose of providing an effective desegregation plan.  The power to disregard such artificial barriers is all the more clear where, as here, the State has been guilty of discrimination which had the effect of creating and maintaining racial segregation along school district lines.

Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a> and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-2\" id=\"fn5-2_ref\">5</a>  These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.  At stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory basis.  To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school systems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision.  Courts of equity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and effective manner.

Once such a start has been made, the courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry out the ruling in an effective manner.  The burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practicable date.  To that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems.  They will also consider the adequacy of any plans the defendants may propose to meet these problems and to effectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system.

There is no universal answer to complex problems of desegregation; there is obviously no one plan that will do the job in every case.  The matter must be assessed in light of the circumstances present and the options available in each instance.  It is incumbent upon the school board to establish that its proposed plan promises meaningful and immediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segregation.  It is incumbent upon the district court to weigh that claim in light of the facts at hand and in light of any alternatives which may be shown as feasible and more promising in their effectiveness.  Where the court finds the board to be acting in good faith and the proposed plan to have real prospects for dismantling the state-imposed dual system 'at the earliest practicable date,' then the plan may be said to provide effective relief.  Of course, the availability to the board of other more promising courses of action may indicate a lack of good faith; and at the least it places a heavy burden upon the board to explain its preference for an apparently less effective method.  Moreover, whatever plan is adopted will require evaluation in practice, and the court should retain jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed segregation has been completely removed.

So it is here; no attempt has been made to justify the transfer provision as a device designed to meet 'legitimate local problems,' ibid.; rather it patently operates as a device to allow resegregation of the races to the extent desegregation would be achieved by geographically drawn zones.  Respondent's argument in this Court reveals its purpose.  We are frankly told in the Brief that without the transfer option it is apprehended that while students will flee the school system altogether.

As the statement of facts shows, these findings are abundantly supported by the record.

An additional step was pairing, 'clustering,' or 'grouping' of schools with attendance assignments made deliberately to accomplish the transfer of Negro students out of formerly segregated Negro schools and transfer of white students to formerly all-Negro schools.  More often than not, these zones are neither compact nor contiguous; indeed they may be on opposite ends of the city.  As an interim corrective measure, this cannot be said to be beyond the broad remedial powers of a court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p604\">\n      <span class=\"num\">604</span>\n      <p>\"Absent a constitutional violation there would be no basis for judicially ordering assignment of students on a racial basis.  All things being equal, with no history of discrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes.  But all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation.  The remedy for such segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p605\">\n      <span class=\"num\">605</span>\n      <p>\"No fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can go, but it must be recognized that there are limits.  The objective is to dismantle the dual school system. 'Racially neutral' assignment plans proposed by school authorities to a district court may be inadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion of school size in order to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation.  When school authorities present a district court with a 'loaded game board,' affirmative action in the form of remedial altering of attendance zones is proper to achieve truly non-discriminatory assignments.  In short, an assignment plan is not acceptable simply because it appears to be neutral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p606\">\n      <span class=\"num\">606</span>\n      <p>\"In this area, we must of necessity rely to a large extent, as this Court has for more than 16 years, on the informed judgment of the district courts in the first instance and on courts of appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p607\">\n      <span class=\"num\">607</span>\n      <p>\"We hold that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school zones is a permissible tool and such action is to be considered in light of the objectives sought.

No rigid guidelines as to student transportation can be given for application to the infinite variety of problems presented in thousands of situations.  Bus transportation has been an integral part of the public education system for years, and was perhaps the single most important factor in the transition from the one-room schoolhouse to the consolidated school.  Eighteen million of the Nation's public school children, approximately 39%, were transported to their schools by bus in 1969-1970 in all parts of the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p610\">\n      <span class=\"num\">610</span>\n      <p>\"The importance of bus transportation as a normal and accepted tool of educational policy is readily discernible in this and the companion case, Davis, supra.  The Charlotte school authorities did not purport to assign students on the basis of geographically drawn zones until 1965 and then they allowed almost unlimited transfer privileges.  The District Court's conclusion that assignment of children to the school nearest their home serving their grade would not produce an effective dismantling of the dual system is supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p611\">\n      <span class=\"num\">611</span>\n      <p>\"Thus the remedial techniques used in the District Court's order were within that court's power to provide equitable relief; implementation of the decree is well within the capacity of the school authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p612\">\n      <span class=\"num\">612</span>\n      <p>\"The decree provided that the buses used to implement the plan would operate on direct routes.  Students would be picked up at schools near their homes and transported to the schools they were to attend.  The trips for elementary school pupils average about seven miles and the District Court found that they would take 'not over 35 minutes at the most.'  This system compares favorably with the transportation plan previously operated in Charlotte under which each day 23,600 students on all grade levels were transported an average of 15 miles one way for an average trip requiring over an hour.  In these circumstances, we find no basis for holding that the local school authorities may not be required to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation.  Desegregation plans cannot be limited to the walk-in school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p613\">\n      <span class=\"num\">613</span>\n      <p>\"An objection to transportation of students may have validity when the time or distance of travel is so great as to either risk the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process.  District courts must weigh the soundness of any transportation plan in light of what is said in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) above.  It hardly needs stating that the limits on time of travel will vary with many factors, but probably with none more than the age of the students.

By 1970 it had increased to 43.9% of the total population of 1,511,000.  It is obvious that the great influx of blacks, as well as whites, to Detroit was influenced by the favorable industrial climate existing in Michigan and the ability of its industry, principally automotive, to provide jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p641\">\n      <span class=\"num\">641</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the school year 1970-1971, there was 285,512 students in the public school system in Detroit of which 168,200 or 63.8% were black and 117,312 or 37.2% were white.  The School Board of Detroit ought not to be blamed for the heavy concentration of blacks in the inner City, for housing conditions, or for discrimination by public or private agencies or individuals and ought not to be saddled with the duty to dismantle the concentration.

In Spencer the black students sued the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey, the Commissioner of Education and the State Board of Education alleging that they failed to achieve a racial balance among several districts of a state system of public schools.  New Jersey, like Michigan, did not operate a dual system and the alleged imbalance was characterized as de facto segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p657\">\n      <span class=\"num\">657</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three-judge Court which heard the case stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p658\">\n      <span class=\"num\">658</span>\n      <p>\"In none of the schools of which the plaintiffs complain is any black pupil 'segregated' from any white pupil.  Indeed, complaint is made that the blacks who reside in the school district served predominate over the whites, thus affording an example of complete desegregation which was the expressed object of the court in the Brown case. 347 U.S. at page 487 of the Opinion at page 688 of 74 S.Ct. in Brown it is stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p659\">\n      <span class=\"num\">659</span>\n      <p>'In each of the cases [from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware] minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis.

On the contrary plaintiffs would have a substantial portion of the pupils now in attendance in their respective schools ordered by the court removed from these schools and assigned to a school in another district.  Alternatively plaintiffs would have the court abolish the respective districts in which their schools are located and assign them to other districts in which the disproportion between white and black students is reduced in one direction or the other.  If, as plaintiffs contend, the proportionate black attendance in their respective schools adversely affects the degree of excellence of education which they can receive there must be a point at which any excess of blacks over whites is likely to impair the quality of the education available in that school for the black pupils.  Nowhere in the Appendix filed by the plaintiffs or in the facts involved in any of the judicial precedents which they cite are we informed of the specific racial proportions which are likely to assure maximum excellence of the educational advantages available for the whites.  Assuming further that efforts to achieve the ideal interracial proportion necessarily include the alteration of the population factor determinative of the redistricting, there can be no assurance that the population factor will remain static.  If so, it would be necessary to successively reassign pupils to another district as the rate of births and graduations alters the racial proportions creating the demand for the educational facilities as it changes from term to term.

The setting of municipalities as local school districts is a reasonable standard especially in light of the municipal taxing authority.  The system as provided by the various legislative enactments is unitary in nature and intent and any purported racial imbalance within a local school district results from an imbalance in the population of that municipality-school district.

Plaintiffs cannot complain about school district lines because those lines were neutrally drawn with the incorporation of the cities long before the Negroes had migrated north in large numbers.  If school-zone lines in Detroit have not been properly drawn or if there are imbalances of black and white students, or imbalances on faculty or staffs in the Detroit schools, or if school buildings have been improperly located, or if plaintiffs have been discriminated against in any other respect, these inequities can all be remedied in the Detroit school system without forcibly moving Negroes and whites against their will across district lines into other counties and districts.

See also the discussion entitled \"Busing: A Review of 'The Evidence\"', The Public Interest No. 30 Winter 1973; \"The Evidence on Busing,\" The Public Interest No. 28 Summer 1972; Ross, \"Why Quotas Won't Work,\" Reader's Digest, Feb. 1973, p. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p684\">\n      <span class=\"num\">684</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's metropolitan cross-district order, an order purportedly directed at furthering the purposes of the equal protection clause, itself clashes with this constitutional principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p685\">\n      <span class=\"num\">685</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The metropolitan busing remedy ordered by the Court is, however, unconstitutional on a more fundamental level.  It invalidly assumes that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects groups and not individuals.  The entire thrust of the District Court's order is that the rights of blacks as a group must be redressed and that, in the process, the rights of individual black children (and non-black children) may be disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p686\">\n      <span class=\"num\">686</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consider the burden on the individual students who are bused in order to achieve a \"racial balance\" throughout the entire Detroit Metropolitan Area.  Individual black and white students who formerly walked to a nearby school would be forced to travel substantial distances to other schools.  These are not individuals who are burdened because their parents have chosen to reside far from the nearest school in the district or because they have special educational needs attended to in but a single school in the district.  These are individual children who are burdened with being bused solely because they are black or white, as the case may be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p687\">\n      <span class=\"num\">687</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parenthetically, it should be noted that if there were any question that busing involves a substantial burden on the individual who cannot attend his neighborhood school, that question has been dispelled by the urgings of desegregation-case plaintiffs that black children can not be \"unequally burdened\" by being the only students bused, the white students being permitted to attend their neighborhood schools.

Yet this is precisely what the District Court has held.  The Court states (correctly) that discrimination against the black race in Detroit must be remedied, but then orders massive interdistrict busing of students to achieve racial balances, denying individual blacks (and nonblacks) their right not to be substantially burdened solely on account of their race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p694\">\n      <span class=\"num\">694</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the fundamental error of the District Court order was in treating the Michigan school system as a dual system when it was not, and in proposing the dismantling of concentration of blacks in Detroit and distributing them in fiftytwo other school districts in three other counties.  Virtually all of the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs to support the District Court's rulings involved dual school systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p695\">\n      <span class=\"num\">695</span>\n      <p>DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS OF FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE CONSTITUTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p696\">\n      <span class=\"num\">696</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, as stated by the majority, this is the fourth time that the case has been before us, the District Court has not as yet adopted any specific plan for desegregation; instead the District Court has entered a number of interlocutory orders some of which are now before us for review under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b).  These include rulings on the issue of Segregation, findings of fact and conclusions of law on Detroit Only Plan of Desegregation, propriety of a Metropolitan remedy to desegregate Detroit Schools, Desegregation Area, and Order directing Michigan State officials to purchase 295 school buses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p697\">\n      <span class=\"num\">697</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This procedure is unprecedented.  Usually school desegregation cases are reviewed on appeal only after a plan of desegregation has been adopted.  It appears to us that the District Court has placed the cart before the horse.  It has entered a number of far-reaching piecemeal interlocutory orders from which no appeal could be taken without the court's permission, and which would bring about a fait accompli of a metropolitan plan without affording the defendants their right of appeal.  This was in the absence of necessary and indispensable parties and to the prejudice of intervening school districts which had been denied effective participation in the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p698\">\n      <span class=\"num\">698</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint, which has never been amended, sought only the desegregation of the Detroit school system.  There was no allegation that any other school district would be affected.  As soon as it was determined that other school districts might be adversely affected, the District Court should have required the plaintiffs to make them parties defendant with a full opportunity to be heard on the merits of the case.  These school districts were necessary and indispensable parties.  This is the correct procedure, and was followed in Bradley v.

They were entitled to be heard on all issues in the case which affected them, and were entitled to participate effectively in the proceedings.  They were entitled to be heard on the issues of segregation, the \"Detroit-Only plan\" and the \"Metropolitan plan\".  They had the right to offer evidence and endeavor to prove that there was no causal connection between any act or omission of the Detroit Board of Education (or of the State) and the concentration of blacks in the inner City, and that whatever constitutional violations of the rights of the plaintiffs may have occurred, such violations could be remedied within the Detroit school district without invading other districts which were not in any manner responsible for conditions in Detroit.  These rights were denied to the intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p700\">\n      <span class=\"num\">700</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the orders of the District Court on these three issues were interlocutory, the judgment entered by the majority is final and the issues may not be relitigated on remand.  Thus judgment has been entered against the absent school districts as well as those allowed to intervene, in violation of their due process rights to a fair and impartial trial.  The orders affirmed are far reaching; they will require the expenditure of untold millions, and will disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and their parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p701\">\n      <span class=\"num\">701</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in its opinion the majority did provide for amendment of pleadings on remand, making new party defendants, for intervention, and for offering additional testimony.  These provisions are wholly illusory with respect to the issues of segregation, the \"Detroit-Only plan\" and the \"Metropolitan plan\", as the opinion expressly excludes these issues from reconsideration upon the remand.  The only remedy available to the intervening school districts is to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari.  The eighteen school districts, as well as any additional school districts which the District Court may add to the desegregation area upon the remand, are without any remedy.  Since they have never been made parties, they may not petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.  They have surely been deprived of their property rights, not only without due process of law, but without any process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p702\">\n      <span class=\"num\">702</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion, with its disapproval of the \"Detroit-Only\" plan and its order to the District Court to consider and adopt a so-called \"Metropolitan\" plan invading the borders of three counties and the boundaries of fifty-two school districts, completely destroys local control of the public school system along with all of its advantages.

In part, local control means, as Professor Coleman suggests, the freedom to devote more money to the education of one's children.  Equally important, however, is the opportunity it offers for participation in the decision-making process that determines how those local tax dollars will be spent.  Each locality is free to tailor local programs to local needs.  Pluralism also affords some opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and a healthy competition for educational excellence.  An analogy to the Nation-State relationship in our federal system seems uniquely appropriate.  Mr. Justice Brandeis identified as one of the peculiar strengths of our form of government each State's freedom to 'serve as a laboratory . . . and try novel social and economic experiments.'

Less than 36 hours later the court issued its 'Ruling on Propriety of Considering a Metropolitan Remedy to Accomplish Desegregation of the Public Schools of the City of Detroit' (A.

It is obvious that the Detroit Board was motivated by its concern that a 63.8%-black and a 37.2%-white quota was too heavily weighted with black pupils, and that it owed a constitutional duty to dilute that quota and to distribute the black-pupil population of Detroit into the other three counties and fifty-two additional school districts, in order to effectuate a quota of about 25%-black and 75%-white children in each school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p726\">\n      <span class=\"num\">726</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is submitted that no such constitutional duty exists and that the District Court erred in ordering it; Swann, supra.THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION PROSCRIBES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p727\">\n      <span class=\"num\">727</span>\n      <p>SUITS AGAINST THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND IT HAS</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p728\">\n      <span class=\"num\">728</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have attempted to sue the State of Michigan by making the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Acting Superintendent of Schools parties defendant.

These problems arise from the existence of conflicting, fundamentally incompatible values.  On the one hand, we social workers value righting the wrongs perpetrated for too long on minority groups.  On the other hand, we value the right of all persons to be treated equally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p746\">\n      <span class=\"num\">746</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distributive justice requires the dissemination of benefits to all without depriving any individual or group of something it values.  This is far more in keeping with fairness and equity than the idea of redistributive justice, which confers benefits on one group at the expense of others.  Redistributive justice, then, leads to reverse discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p747\">\n      <span class=\"num\">747</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Redistributive justice is advocated to atone for our failure to live up to the belief in the capacity and the dignity of each human being.  This failure does not negate the soundness of that belief.  Rather, it should spur us to correct the failure-not the belief.  When practices fail to reflect principles, then we should change our practices, not our principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p748\">\n      <span class=\"num\">748</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For social workers, the issue has come to the forefront in agency and university hiring practices and admissions policies of schools of social work.  Social agencies, especially those serving ghetto populations, are giving preference to minority group members in employment.  Universities, beset by pressures from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, are similarly giving preference to women and minority groups.  Some schools of social work have adopted quota systems in dealing with candidates for admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p749\">\n      <span class=\"num\">749</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These practices conflict with the fundamental social work belief in individual human dignity and the libertarian belief that each person is entitled to be judged and valued as an individual.  Quota systems and preferential treatment are artificial restrictions on this right because they substitute irrelevant group characteristics such as race or religion for consideration of an individual's capacity and potential.  Respect for the individual is a basic part of social work's credo and commitment.  We cannot reconcile this conviction with treating people only as representatives of a racial group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p750\">\n      <span class=\"num\">750</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we try to eliminate discrimination and compensate for past wrongs by quota systems, we substitute one injustice for another.  We deny the inherent equality of all people and undermine the proposition that each individual should have the same opportunity to achieve and to be judged according to his merits.  We pit group against group and destroy the possibility of harmonious interaction.  Quotas are pernicious instruments; they represent an unacceptable means for achieving a desirable end. \"Preferential quotas are condescending, divisive and detrimental to the integrity of a university.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-3\" id=\"fn1-3_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p751\">\n      <span class=\"num\">751</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A quota system institutionalizes discrimination and must be vigorously opposed.  Ultimately, it is a form of segregation.  The progressive democratization of the university through the elimination of any criterion for admission other than merit has been one of the success stories of America.  Now some of the benighted beneficiaries of that victory ally themselves with those antilibertarian forces that would have blocked their own access to education.  They are ready to eradicate the victory of equal opportunity over discriminatory quotas, for which their forebears fought so hard.  That victory has only been partially won.  We cannot falter now by substituting a host of irrelevant and inappropriate considerations for merit.  The test a university must apply to each candidate is merit-not inherited status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p752\">\n      <span class=\"num\">752</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some advocates of quota systems believe that quotas will redress wrongs and thus produce equal opportunity, when actually they eliminate equal opportunity.  Quotas have historically been used for exclusion.  They were an insidious manifestation of institutionalized bigotry, covertly designed to exclude unwanted groups.  They were wrong in the past and they are wrong now, even though they are now designed to achieve inclusion, rather than exclusion.  Discriminatory practices are wrong, no matter what their intent.  Whether they are for or against particular groups, quota systems are morally indefensible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p753\">\n      <span class=\"num\">753</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For social workers, the distinctions among people based on race, ethnic background, religion, or creed that inhere in quota systems are particularly abhorrent.

Proportional representation on a group basis is highly discriminatory.  What taxonomy shall be used to categorize the groups that should be represented?

I am further in accord with the conclusion of the majority that the District Court's order for the purchase of buses for use in effectuating a plan of integration covering the metropolitan Detroit area is premature and must be stayed until an appropriate plan has been approved by the District Court.  I agree that each of the suburban school districts which may be affected by any proposed metropolitan plan is a necessary party to the litigation within the meaning of Rule 19, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as found by the majority and that the pleadings must be amended to join such school districts and bring all parties before the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p763\">\n      <span class=\"num\">763</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is at this point that I separate from the majority and find myself compelled to state the reasons why I cannot join in the majority opinion.

In determining the fact of discrimination vel non, whether imposed by statute or as a result of official action, the district court must identify the school or schools which are segregated as a result of such discrimination.  This identification must be supported by findings of fact.  The importance of such a determination will be seen in some populous school districts embracing large geographical areas.  There may be segregated schools which are the result of unconstitutional statutes or of official action.  There may be other one race schools which are the product of neutral, non-discriminatory forces.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p771\">\n      <span class=\"num\">771</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we accept the premise that \"the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy,\" as announced by the United States Supreme Court, then, clearly, the remedy proposed by the District Court, and approved by a majority of this Court, goes far beyond the \"nature of the violation\" since the District Court has already stated as a conclusion that no evidence was taken as to any violation with regard to any suburban school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p772\">\n      <span class=\"num\">772</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the minority in the Texas Education Agency case disapproved of the suggestion of the majority that specific schools within a system must be found to have been segregated, and treated separately, (<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></span> where the minority speaks through Judge Wisdom), yet the minority does not find nor even suggest that it would be appropriate to expand the order for relief beyond the system found to have committed acts which violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs in the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p773\">\n      <span class=\"num\">773</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through the majority's opinion runs the thread which holds it together.  That thread is the unwillingness apparent in the minds of the majority to sanction a black school district within a city which it concludes will be surrounded by white suburbs.  While the majority does not now state that such a demographic pattern is inherently unconstitutional, nevertheless, I am persuaded that those who subscribe to the majority opinion are convinced, as stated in the slip opinion of the original panel, \"big city school systems for blacks surrounded by suburban school systems for whites cannot represent equal protection of the law.\"  While that statement has been removed from the opinion of the majority, yet the premise upon which the statement was obviously based must necessarily form the foundation for the conclusions reached in the majority opinion.  It may be that such will become the law, but such a conclusion should not receive our approval on a record such as exists in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p774\">\n      <span class=\"num\">774</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As has been pointed out in the other opinions, the boundaries of the school district of the City of Detroit have been co-terminus with the boundaries of the City of Detroit for more than 100 years.  Those lines were laid out at a time when there was a minimal black population in the metropolitan area of Detroit, if there was such metropolitan area at the time the boundary lines were established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p775\">\n      <span class=\"num\">775</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge and the majority make much of the fact that \"if the boundary lines of the school districts of the City of Detroit and the surrounding suburbs were drawn today few would doubt that they could not withstand constitutional challenge.\"  This interesting statement provides a fertile field for speculation but certainly has no validity.  A proposal to adopt an amendment to the Constitution of the United States in the same manner and with the same people voting as adopted the Constitution of the United States would be stricken immediately.  I know of no one who would suggest that because of changes in the methods of electing the membership of state legislatures that the Constitution of the United States thereby becomes unconstitutional.  The quoted statement is to me a complete non sequitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p776\">\n      <span class=\"num\">776</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know of no authority which would permit a Court to announce a conclusion, based upon a violation of the Constitution, absent the taking of proofs to establish such constitutional violation, which proofs the District Judge stated he did not take in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p777\">\n      <span class=\"num\">777</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent proofs, which clearly were not taken, to establish a violation of the constitutional rights of these plaintiffs by the suburban school district personnel and by the State of Michigan in laying out suburban school district lines it would appear that we are in complete and absolute conflict with the prior decisions of this Court.

Again it may be that this will become the law.  Clearly, the cases cited have reached this conclusion as to the attendance lines existing within a specific school system.  I know of no case which permits such a conclusion as to boundary lines existing between school districts, and while the conclusion that existing boundary lines cannot be frozen for an unconstitutional purpose may flow logically from the premise announced it should be based upon competent evidence justifying a finding of fact that such boundary lines have been frozen for an unconstitutional purpose, and the District Judge in this case announced that he took no evidence on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p789\">\n      <span class=\"num\">789</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not understand how the majority can reach a conclusion as to an appropriate remedy without evidence of any violation, particularly when in Deal I and Deal II a contrary conclusion has been reached.

Clearly, if the Court took no proofs with respect to the commission of acts causing segregation of the races as between the City of Detroit and the suburban school districts it would be inappropriate to include those school districts within any remedy to be adopted to eliminate segregation within the City of Detroit.  The cases cited by the District Court and by the majority of this Court are inapplicable.  In each case cited the school district involved and against which a remedial order was granted was found to have been guilty of segregative practices.  In every instance, as we read the cases, that finding was supported by substantial evidence after an adversary proceeding in which all the interested parties were represented.  Such is not the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p798\">\n      <span class=\"num\">798</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems obvious to me that the majority and the District Court have become confused and are unable to distinguish between violation and remedy.  As stated by the District Court no evidence was taken as to any violation in the fixing of the boundaries of the suburban school systems nor as to any violation because of the relationship between the suburban school systems and the schools of the City of Detroit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p799\">\n      <span class=\"num\">799</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The errors to which we have already alluded were brought about by the failure on the part of the District Court to require that all interested parties be brought into the case at the earliest appropriate moment.  A review of this record reveals that on March 22, 1971, a group of white Detroit residents, who were parents of children enrolled in the Detroit public schools, were permitted to intervene as parties defendant.  On June 24, 1971, the District Judge alluded to the possibility of a metropolitan school system, App.  Vol. IV, pgs. 259, 260, and in that connection stated: \"As I have said to several witnesses in this case: how do you desegregate a black city, or a black school system.\"  App. Vol.  IV, pg. 260.  Subsequently, and on July 17, 1971, the white parents filed a motion in an effort to require the joinder of the 85 suburban school districts as parties defendant and gave the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p800\">\n      <span class=\"num\">800</span>\n      <p>\"1. That said suburban school districts are agents of the State of Michigan and subject to the jurisdiction and supervision of the State Board of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p801\">\n      <span class=\"num\">801</span>\n      <p>\"2.

In the event that this Court rules for the plaintiff, in the absence of joinder of the proposed school districts, complete relief cannot be awarded the plaintiff, and in addition would impose an unconstitutional burden on the intervening defendant, in that the resulting school district of the City of Detroit would be and will remain as established by the proofs already submitted an inferior school district.\"  App. I at 142-3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p804\">\n      <span class=\"num\">804</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court did not rule upon this motion, but in the course of the proceedings discussed it in September, 1971, and concluded that the motion should not be considered at that time because \"in considering the motion to add the listed school districts we pause to note that the proposed action has to do with relief.\"  App. Vol.  I, pg. 215, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2182098\"><a href=\"/opinion/2182098/bradley-v-milliken/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

These motions were finally granted on March 15, 1972, during the second day of hearing on the plans for desegregation involving only the Detroit school system.  Intervention, according to the District Judge, was permitted under Rule 24(a), \"Intervention of Right,\" and also under Rule 24(b), \"Permissive Intervention.\"  Before permitting such intervention and on March 6, 1972, the District Judge set up a timetable for the consideration of plans already submitted, which timetable was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p806\">\n      <span class=\"num\">806</span>\n      <p>\"1.

All of this despite the fact that an effort had been made to bring the suburban school districts into the case almost eight months prior to the rulings in regard to the Detroit only plans and the metropolitan plan.  The majority finds no fault with this timetable.  It affirms the conclusions of the District Court in regard to the Detroit only plan and the need for a metropolitan plan without affording to the suburban school districts any opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p822\">\n      <span class=\"num\">822</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those suburban school districts which are not yet parties to this action, 43 in number, have had no opportunity to be heard with respect to any alleged constitutional violation within their respective school districts or with respect to the existence of their respective school district boundaries.  Of course, the pleadings do not assert any such violations but under the majority opinion a remedy will be imposed which will drastically affect the future schooling of their children without granting to them any opportunity to be heard with regard to any reasons which might support the adoption of such a remedy.  The suburban school districts which were belatedly made parties to this action assert that because they have not been afforded the opportunity to offer evidence to demonstrate that they have not been guilty of any constitutional violation they have been denied the fundamental requirements of due process.  The response of the appellee to the claimed rights of the suburban school districts is that there is no denial of \"life, liberty or property\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  They also claim that the interests of the suburban school districts were adequately represented by \"their parent state defendant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p823\">\n      <span class=\"num\">823</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the record in this case will effectively dispose of any claim that the interests of the suburban school districts were represented by the state defendants.  Clearly, the state defendants were defending against the claims of the plaintiffs that the state had by its actions created racial segregation within the school district of the City of Detroit.  As I examine the record it does not appear that any defendant felt compelled to offer evidence in defense of an unasserted claim that the existence of suburban school districts was without other evidence a violation of the constitutional rights of the students in the schools of the City of Detroit.  Had the state defendants comprehended that the District Court intended to impose a metropolitan school district upon the schools of three counties the writer is confident that they would have joined in the earlier motion to require the suburban school districts to be named as parties defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p824\">\n      <span class=\"num\">824</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first argument of the appellees it is clear from the language of the Court in Bolling v. Sharpe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

My whole purpose in writing this opinion is to point out that the majority and the District Court have fallen into a state of confusion in failing to distinguish between violation and remedy and in failing to recognize the necessity for the finding of violation before the trial court embarks upon that broad field of equity which permits a trial judge to devise a remedy which will adequately overcome the violation previously found to be in existence.  I have also written because I am satisfied that the District Judge in failing to consider the necessity for joining the suburban school districts pursuant to a motion filed more than a year before the disposition of the case was in error.  The suggestion by the District Court that the suburban school districts were only involved in the remedy points up the trap into which both the District Court and the majority of this Court have fallen in failing to recognize the necessity for finding a violation before a remedy may be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p842\">\n      <span class=\"num\">842</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the District Court and remand the case with instructions to require the joinder of the suburban school districts of the counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb with permission to the representatives of those districts, with reasonable limitations, to participate in all aspects of this lawsuit which may affect the suburban school districts, and with particular attention to the necessity for finding a constitutional violation which would justify the imposition of a metropolitan remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p843\">\n      <span class=\"num\">843</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WILLIAM E. MILLER, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p844\">\n      <span class=\"num\">844</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is my firm conviction that it is premature at this time for the Court to adjudicate any of the questions arising from the various orders of the district court from which this appeal is taken.  This is true for the reason that school districts and parties to be affected by a metropolitan plan or remedy have not been afforded an opportunity to be heard or to present evidence upon all of the issues involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion does indeed state:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p845\">\n      <span class=\"num\">845</span>\n      <p>On remand, any party against whom relief is sought, including school districts which heretofore have intervened and school districts which hereafter may become parties to this litigation, shall be afforded an opportunity to offer additional evidence, and to cross-examine available witnesses who previously have testified, on any issue raised by the pleadings, including amendments thereto, as may be relevant and admissible to such issues.  The District Court may consider any evidence now on file and such additional competent evidence as may be introduced by any party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p846\">\n      <span class=\"num\">846</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of this conclusion is, in my opinion, vitiated by the two succeeding sentences:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p847\">\n      <span class=\"num\">847</span>\n      <p>However, the District Court will not be required to receive any additional evidence as to the matters contained in its Ruling on the Issue of Segregation, dated September 27, 1971, and reported at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></span>, or its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on the \"Detroit-only\" plans of desegregation, dated March 28, 1972.  We hold that the findings of fact contained in these rulings are not clearly erroneous, Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., but to the contrary are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p848\">\n      <span class=\"num\">848</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties to be affected and against whom relief is sought should be accorded, in compliance with basic principles of due process, an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner not only with respect to the ultimate scope of the remedy to be fashioned, but also with respect to important, significant and perhaps even controlling issues, including the issue of segregation, a \"Detroit only\" school plan and the propriety of a metropolitan remedy.  If any one of these issues is resolved in favor of parties outside the Detroit School District, the nature and scope of a remedy embracing outlying districts would not be reached.  Hence the outlying districts have a vital interest in each issue separately and should be heard on each in a true adversary sense.  Until this is done our expression of view on the merits of the several questions is uncalled for and ill-advised.  To permit these additional parties to be heard only in the restricted sense set forth in the majority opinion is to deny them basic rights guaranteed not only by Rule 19, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but by the Constitution itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p849\">\n      <span class=\"num\">849</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would, therefore, vacate all orders appealed from the district court, remand the action for the joinder of all parties to be affected, and direct the district court to afford the parties a proper opportunity to be heard and to present evidence on the issues indicated above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>\"1.

A class action lies where a number of persons have similar individual rights infringed</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, it does not follow that simply because a class action is available to redress discrimination individual rights can be obliterated by superimposing the \"rights\" of the class.</p>\n        <p>The individual plaintiffs, who charge in their Complaint the maintenance of a desegregated school system in Detroit, were all Negroes except one.  Nevertheless, the District Court in determining the class held \"that the plaintiffs in their action represent all school children in the City of Detroit, Michigan, and all Detroit resident parents who have children of school age, . . ..\" Thus white and black children and their parents, who are not situated similarly with the plaintiffs and may violently disagree with plaintiffs' position, are arbitrarily placed in the same class.
