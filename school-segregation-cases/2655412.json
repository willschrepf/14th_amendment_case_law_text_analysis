Boyer-Liberto,        the    African-American     plaintiff      in\n\nthese civil rights proceedings, alleges that within a single\n\ntwenty-four-hour period in September 2010, while working as a\n\ncocktail waitress at the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau Hotel in\n\nOcean City, Maryland (the “Clarion”), she was twice called a\n\n“porch monkey” and threatened with the loss of her job by a\n\nCaucasian restaurant manager.             Soon after reporting to higher-\n\nups at the hotel that she had been racially harassed, Liberto\n\nwas fired by the Clarion’s owner, Dr. Leonard P. Berger.                        This\n\naction against the Fontainebleau Corporation and Berger ensued,\n\nwith Liberto asserting claims of hostile work environment and\n\nretaliation, under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.              The district court awarded summary\n\njudgment to the defendants, see Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau\n\nCorp., No. 1:12-cv-00212 (D. Md. Apr. 5, 2013), ECF No. 52, and\n\na not-fully-unanimous panel of this Court affirmed, see Boyer-\n\nLiberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., 752 F.3d 350 (4th Cir. 2014).\n\nThe   panel’s     decision   was   vacated,       however,     by   our   grant    of\n\nrehearing en banc.\n\n      As   explained    below,     we    now    vacate   the   judgment    of     the\n\ndistrict court and remand for further proceedings on Liberto’s\n\nclaims.      In    so   doing,     we    underscore      the    Supreme    Court’s\n\npronouncement in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775,\n\n                                          3\n\f788    (1998),       that    an    isolated        incident    of    harassment,       if\n\nextremely serious, can create a hostile work environment.                              We\n\nalso recognize that an employee is protected from retaliation\n\nwhen   she    reports       an   isolated     incident   of    harassment      that    is\n\nphysically threatening or humiliating, even if a hostile work\n\nenvironment is not engendered by that incident alone.                          Finally,\n\nwe specify that, to the extent today’s decision is in conflict\n\nwith Jordan v. Alternative Resources Corp., 458 F.3d 332 (4th\n\nCir. 2006), Jordan is hereby overruled.\n\n\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       The record in this matter reflects that on August 4, 2010,\n\nLiberto      began    working      at   the       Clarion,    an    oceanfront    hotel\n\ncontaining       guest      rooms,      several      restaurants       and     bars,    a\n\nnightclub,      and    a    conference      center    with    meeting    and     banquet\n\nfacilities. 1        During the seven weeks she was employed with the\n\n\n       1\n       For purposes of our de novo assessment of the district\ncourt’s summary judgment award, we view the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Liberto, as the nonmoving party. See Laber v.\nHarvey, 438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th Cir. 2006) (en banc). Thus, like\nthe district court, we accept that Liberto was called a “porch\nmonkey” on two consecutive days, and that the defendants knew of\nat least one of those alleged slurs when the decision to\ndischarge Liberto was made.   See Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau\nCorp., No. 1:12-cv-00212, slip op. at 3 n.2 (D. Md. Apr. 5,\n2013), ECF No. 52. Much of our factual recitation is drawn from\nLiberto’s   deposition  testimony;  we  do   not  rely   on  her\n(Continued)\n                                              4\n\fClarion’s       Food    and    Beverage        Department,        Liberto     worked    in\n\nassorted       roles,   including       restaurant         hostess,    restaurant      and\n\nbanquet server, bartender, and cocktail waitress.                           According to\n\nLiberto, the Clarion assigned her that variety of jobs so that\n\nshe    could    learn    all    positions         within    the    Food   and    Beverage\n\nDepartment as part of her training.\n\n        On the night of September 14, 2010, Liberto was working as\n\na cocktail waitress in the Clarion’s nightclub.                              One of her\n\ncustomers ordered a “Hula Hula,” a drink that is time-consuming\n\nto prepare.       The bartender in the adjacent main bar refused to\n\nfill    the    order,    explaining       to      Liberto    that     other     nightclub\n\npatrons would see the Hula Hula and want that drink, too.                          In an\n\neffort to please her customer and after consulting immediate\n\nsupervisor Jamie Avery, Liberto went beyond the main bar to the\n\npub bar, where she found a bartender willing to make a Hula\n\nHula.     Once the drink was prepared, Liberto wanted to avoid a\n\nconfrontation with the bartender in the main bar, so she chose a\n\nnew    path    back     to    the    nightclub      that    took    her     through    the\n\nrestaurant       kitchen.           Liberto    carried      the   Hula    Hula    briskly\n\nthrough the kitchen and across the nightclub to her customer’s\n\ntable.     She then went to a server station, which was located in\n\n\n\ninterrogatory   answers,  which  the                   district       court      properly\nexcluded from consideration. See id.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fthe nightclub several feet from the kitchen doors, to print a\n\nguest check.\n\n     At that point, Liberto was confronted by Trudi Clubb, a\n\nwhite Food and Beverage Manager at the Clarion.                      Unbeknownst to\n\nLiberto, Clubb had been yelling at Liberto as she passed through\n\nthe kitchen carrying the Hula Hula.                  Liberto soon learned that\n\nClubb was livid because she believed that Liberto had heard but\n\nignored her.         As Liberto worked at the server station, Clubb\n\ncame through the kitchen doors, loudly screaming, “Hey, girl\n\nthat can’t hear.”         J.A. 237. 2          Clubb, still shouting, quickly\n\napproached Liberto, who turned her face away from Clubb in an\n\neffort    to    remain   calm    —   a     move    that    made   Clubb    even   more\n\nfurious.       Clubb then came so close to Liberto that Liberto could\n\nfeel Clubb’s breath on her face as Clubb stood at Liberto’s\n\nside.      Indeed,    continuing      to    yell    at    Liberto,    Clubb    sprayed\n\nLiberto’s face with saliva.                Clubb’s message was that Liberto\n\nshould    have    neither    walked      through     the    kitchen      nor   ignored\n\nClubb, and Liberto repeatedly indicated that she understood and\n\nagreed.\n\n     Clubb’s      shouting      nonetheless        persisted,     even    as   Liberto\n\nleft the server station to tend to nightclub customers.                           Clubb\n\n\n     2\n       Citations herein to “J.A. __” refer to the contents of the\nJoint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fwas now loudly berating Liberto for walking away from her, at\n\nfirst following Liberto into the nightclub and then moving back\n\nto the server station.             Upon Liberto’s subsequent return to that\n\narea, Clubb finally proceeded to exit the nightclub into the\n\nkitchen.      As she did so, Clubb threatened Liberto in words that\n\nincluded, “[I’m] going to get [you]” and “[I’m] going to make\n\n[you] sorry.”        J.A. 252-53.       Clubb then concluded her threat by\n\nturning to look at Liberto and calling her either a “damn porch\n\nmonkey” or a “dang porch monkey.”             See id. at 258.\n\n      Upon    arriving       for    a   dinner    shift     the   following     day,\n\nSeptember 15, 2010, Liberto went to the Clarion’s management\n\noffice to report Clubb’s conduct to Food and Beverage Director\n\nRichard Heubeck.        Liberto had just begun talking to Heubeck when\n\nshe was interrupted by Clubb, who came into the office and said\n\nto Liberto, “I need to speak to you, little girl.”                     J.A. 263.\n\nLiberto responded that she was meeting with Heubeck, but Clubb\n\nretorted,     “I’m    more     important,”    prompting      Liberto   to     follow\n\nClubb out of the office.             Id. at 263-64.       Clubb and Liberto sat\n\nat a nearby table, and Clubb reprimanded Liberto, in a raised\n\nand   angry    voice,    for    passing    through    the    kitchen   the    prior\n\nnight.     As the two women then rose from the table and pushed in\n\ntheir chairs, Clubb threatened, “I’m gonna get you.                    I’m gonna\n\ngo to [hotel owner] Dr. Berger.”                 Id. at 266.      Her voice still\n\nloud and angry though somewhat lower than before, Clubb capped\n\n                                          7\n\fthe threat by looking directly at Liberto and again calling her\n\na “porch monkey.”               Id. at 266-68.\n\n        On September 16, 2010, Liberto arranged to speak with Human\n\nResources Director Nancy Berghauer by telephone the following\n\nday.      During the September 17 phone call, Liberto complained\n\nthat she had been racially harassed by Clubb.                                      From handwritten\n\nnotes,     Berghauer               prepared       a       typewritten          summary          of     her\n\ndiscussion       with         Liberto,         which      included          Liberto’s       allegation\n\nthat     Clubb      called          her    a     “porch         monkey”       on     September         15.\n\nBerghauer provided the summary on September 17 to Dr. Berger and\n\nGeneral       Manager         Mark     Elman,      and      Elman       met     with      Liberto      on\n\nSeptember      18        to    further         discuss      her       complaint.          Meanwhile,\n\nalthough       Clubb          denied      ever    using         the    term        “porch      monkey,”\n\nHeubeck issued her a written notice on September 18 advising\n\nthat,    as    “a     member         of   our     Food      &     Beverage         Management         team\n\n. . . , [Clubb]               is    expected      to      conduct      herself       as       such”    and\n\n“needs to be cautious the language or phrases she uses can not\n\nbe perceived as racist or derogatory.”                            J.A. 311.\n\n       According          to        Dr.    Berger,         Liberto’s          racial        harassment\n\ncomplaint of September 17, 2010, prompted him to go to Heubeck\n\nthat day and ask — for the first time ever — about Liberto’s\n\nperformance.             In        Berger’s      account,         Heubeck       gave      a    negative\n\nevaluation       of       Liberto         and     attributed            her     variety         of    job\n\nassignments         to    failure         in    every      role       she    tried;     thus,        after\n\n                                                      8\n\ffurther consulting Elman and Berghauer between September 18 and\n\n20, Berger made the decision to fire Liberto immediately.                                   At\n\nthe beginning of her scheduled shift on September 21, Liberto\n\nwas notified that she was being discharged.\n\n       Whether Clubb had been empowered by the Clarion to fire\n\nLiberto or take other tangible employment actions against her is\n\nunclear on this record.               From Liberto’s perspective during her\n\nshort time as a Clarion employee, Clubb “was just Dr. Berger’s\n\nfriend and she was just there to say hello and greet people as a\n\nglorified hostess.”          J.A. 213.            Liberto did not know that Clubb\n\nheld   a   manager       title   and    did       not    consider   Clubb         to   be   her\n\nmanager.         See id. at 214 (Liberto’s deposition testimony that\n\nshe reported to Avery and Heubeck, and that Avery told Liberto\n\n“not to go to [Clubb] because [Clubb] did not have the power to\n\ndo voids or make decisions”).                 Nevertheless, Clubb conveyed to\n\nLiberto — and Liberto got the message — that Clubb was in a\n\nposition to have Liberto terminated.                          Before she had finished\n\njust   her   second      week    of    work       at    the   Clarion,    Liberto       “felt\n\nextremely singled out” by Clubb and perceived that “my position\n\nwas being threatened” by her.                 See id. at 277-79 (discussing an\n\nAugust     16,    2010   Twitter      message          from   Liberto    to   a    co-worker\n\nsaying that Clubb is “after me like [a] starving wol[f] on a\n\nbone”).      Clubb repeatedly told Liberto “what my place was” and\n\n“always made it clear that Dr. Berger would listen to anything\n\n                                              9\n\fshe said and wouldn’t believe me.”                 Id. at 279.            Clubb’s conduct\n\nled Liberto to understand that Clubb “did have power that I did\n\nnot have.”      Id. at 274.        Consistent with that perception, Elman\n\ninformed Liberto during their September 18, 2010 meeting that\n\nClubb was Liberto’s “boss.”             See id. at 324 (September 18 email\n\nto   Heubeck    and    Berghauer      from   Elman       recounting        what    he   told\n\nLiberto).\n\n                                            B.\n\n      On January 23, 2012, after exhausting her administrative\n\nremedies       with     the    federal       government’s            Equal      Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (the “EEOC”), Liberto filed her complaint\n\nin   the   District      of    Maryland.          The    complaint         asserted     four\n\nclaims:        one     claim   each    of        hostile      work    environment        and\n\nretaliation       pursuant       to    Title        VII       against          solely    the\n\nFontainebleau         Corporation,      trading          as    the     Clarion       Resort\n\nFontainebleau         Hotel;   and     one       claim     each      of    hostile      work\n\nenvironment and retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 against both\n\nthe Fontainebleau Corporation and Dr. Berger.\n\n                                            1.\n\n      Following       discovery,      the    defendants        filed       a   motion   for\n\nsummary judgment.         Contesting the validity of the hostile work\n\nenvironment claims, the defendants focused on just one of the\n\nfour elements of such a claim, contending that there had been no\n\nshowing that Clubb’s conduct was severe or pervasive enough to\n\n                                            10\n\falter Liberto’s conditions of employment and produce an abusive\n\nwork environment.         See Okoli v. City of Balt., 648 F.3d 216, 220\n\n(4th Cir. 2011) (“To demonstrate . . . a racially hostile work\n\nenvironment, a plaintiff must show that there is (1) unwelcome\n\nconduct;      (2) that     is   based       on     the    plaintiff’s      . . .     race;\n\n(3) which      is    sufficiently         severe    or    pervasive     to    alter   the\n\nplaintiff’s conditions of employment and to create an abusive\n\nwork environment; and (4) which is imputable to the employer.”\n\n(alteration      and    internal      quotation         marks   omitted));     see    also\n\nSpriggs v.

Credit Union, 424 F.3d 397,\n\n405-06 (4th Cir. 2005) (“In order to establish a prima facie\n\ncase   of     retaliation,      a    plaintiff      must    prove    three    elements:\n\n(1) that      she    engaged    in    a    protected       activity;    (2) that       her\n\nemployer      took   an   adverse      employment        action     against    her;    and\n\n(3) that there was a causal link between the two events.”); see\n\nalso Honor v.

The defendants\n\n                                            11\n\felaborated       that     Liberto’s          complaint         was     not     a    protected\n\nopposition       activity      because        she    could       not    reasonably          have\n\nbelieved       that     Clubb’s       conduct       was    sufficiently            severe    or\n\npervasive      to     engender    a     prohibited        hostile      work    environment.\n\nSee Navy Fed., 424 F.3d at 406 (explaining that an opposition\n\nactivity, such as making an internal complaint, is protected\n\nwhere an employee opposes either “employment actions actually\n\nunlawful       under     Title        VII”    or      “employment            actions    [she]\n\nreasonably believes to be unlawful”).\n\n                                              2.\n\n      In seeking summary judgment, the defendants substantially\n\nrelied    on    our     precedent       in    Jordan      v.    Alternative         Resources\n\nCorp.,    458    F.3d    332     (4th     Cir.      2006).        There,      the    African-\n\nAmerican plaintiff alleged that, while watching a news report on\n\na workplace television about the capture of the infamous D.C.\n\nsnipers in 2002, a co-worker exclaimed in his presence, “They\n\nshould put those two black monkeys in a cage with a bunch of\n\nblack apes and let the apes f[uc]k them.”                         See Jordan, 458 F.3d\n\nat 336.         The plaintiff, Jordan, reported the comment to his\n\nsupervisors and was fired within a month of his complaint.                                  Id.\n\nat 337.     Jordan then filed suit against his employers, alleging,\n\ninter alia, retaliatory discharge in contravention of Title VII\n\nand   § 1981.          Id.        The    district         court      dismissed       Jordan’s\n\ncomplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for\n\n                                              12\n\ffailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and\n\nJordan appealed to our Court, which affirmed by a split panel\n\ndecision.\n\n       Addressing the Title VII retaliation claim, the opinion of\n\nthe panel majority related that, under Title VII, “‘[i]t shall\n\nbe     an   unlawful     employment      practice    for   an     employer     to\n\ndiscriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has\n\nopposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by\n\nthis subchapter.’”           Jordan, 458 F.3d at 338 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-3(a)).         The    majority   continued   that,      “[r]eading    the\n\nlanguage generously to give effect to its purpose, however, we\n\nhave also held that opposition activity is protected when it\n\nresponds to an employment practice that the employee reasonably\n\nbelieves is unlawful.”          Id. (citing Navy Fed., 424 F.3d at 406-\n\n07).\n\n       The Jordan majority observed that the employment practices\n\nthat may be the subject of protected opposition activity include\n\ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) in the form of\n\n“maintaining     a     racially    hostile    work   environment,     i.e.,    a\n\n‘workplace     . . .    permeated     with    discriminatory     intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.’”           Jordan, 458 F.3d at 339 (quoting\n\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993)).                       The\n\n                                         13\n\fmajority further recognized that “[c]ourts determine ‘whether an\n\nenvironment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by looking at all\n\nthe circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory\n\nconduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or\n\nhumiliating,       or    a     mere     offensive         utterance;         and    whether   it\n\nunreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.’”\n\nId. (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787-\n\n88   (1998)).           As    the     majority          explained,       “‘simple      teasing,\n\noffhand     comments,          and     isolated          incidents       (unless      extremely\n\nserious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms\n\nand conditions of employment.’”                        Id. (quoting Faragher, 524 U.S.\n\nat     788).       The        majority        also        noted       that       “hostile   work\n\nenvironments       generally          result       only    after       an    accumulation     of\n\ndiscrete       instances       of     harassment.”              Id.    (citing      Nat’l   R.R.\n\nPassenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 115 (2002) (“Hostile\n\nenvironment claims are different in kind from discrete acts.\n\nTheir very nature involves repeated conduct.                             . . .      Such claims\n\nare based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.”)).\n\n       To   assess      the     merits       of    Jordan’s       Title      VII    retaliation\n\nclaim, the panel majority clarified, “the question reduces to\n\nwhether        Jordan        complained       about        an      actual        hostile    work\n\nenvironment       or,    if     there     was      not     one,       whether     Jordan    could\n\nreasonably have believed there was one.”                               Jordan, 458 F.3d at\n\n339.        The   majority           first    concluded           that      no    hostile   work\n\n                                                  14\n\fenvironment       actually      existed,        in       that    the    “black    monkeys”\n\ncomment — though “unacceptably crude and racist” — “was an\n\nisolated    response      directed        at    the      snipers”      rather    than   “any\n\nfellow employee.”         Id. at 339-40.             The majority underscored that\n\nthe comment “was a singular and isolated exclamation” that did\n\nnot and could not have “altered the terms and conditions of\n\n[Jordan’s]      employment,”        and    that      Jordan      did    “not    describe    a\n\nworkplace       permeated      by    racism,        by    threats      of   violence,      by\n\nimproper    interference        with      work,      or    by    conduct     resulting     in\n\npsychological harm.”           Id. at 340.\n\n     Turning to the issue of Jordan’s reasonable belief, the\n\npanel majority concluded that “no objectively reasonable person\n\ncould have believed that [Jordan’s workplace] was in the grips\n\nof a hostile work environment.”                     Jordan, 458 F.3d at 341.             But\n\nthe majority also acknowledged that, pursuant to Navy Federal,\n\nJordan could rely on a reasonable belief that a hostile work\n\nenvironment      “was    taking      shape.”             See    id.    at   340-41   (“Navy\n\nFederal     holds       that    an     employee           seeking       protection      from\n\nretaliation must have an objectively reasonable belief in light\n\nof all the circumstances that a Title VII violation has happened\n\nor is in progress.”); see also Navy Fed., 424 F.3d at 406-07\n\n(concluding that plaintiff reasonably believed she was opposing\n\nunlawful retaliation by disrupting plan that had been set in\n\nmotion     by    employer      to    terminate           another      employee    for    her\n\n                                               15\n\fdiscrimination      complaints).               The    majority     elaborated      that,\n\n“[u]nder § 2000e-3(a) as construed by Navy Federal, we cannot\n\nsimply   assume,     without     more,         that   the   opposed      conduct      will\n\ncontinue or will be repeated unabated; rather, the employee must\n\nhave   an     objectively     reasonable         belief     that    a    violation      is\n\nactually      occurring   based      on    circumstances         that    the    employee\n\nobserves    and   reasonably      believes.”           Jordan,     458   F.3d    at    341\n\n(emphasis omitted).           From there, the majority determined that\n\nJordan could not establish a reasonable belief that a hostile\n\nwork environment was in progress, in that “no allegation in the\n\ncomplaint suggests that a plan was in motion to create such an\n\nenvironment, let alone that such an environment was even likely\n\nto   occur.”      Id.    at   340.        Accordingly,      the    majority      opinion\n\naffirmed the dismissal of Jordan’s Title VII retaliation claim,\n\nas well as his § 1981 retaliation claim.\n\n       The Jordan dissent agreed with the panel majority that, to\n\ngain protection for his opposition activity, an employee may\n\nrely on a reasonable belief that Title VII is in the process of\n\nbeing violated by the conduct being opposed.                        See Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d at 352 (King, J., dissenting) (citing Navy Fed., 424 F.3d\n\nat 406-07).       The dissent disputed the majority’s view, however,\n\nthat   Navy    Federal    requires        an    employee    opposing      a    potential\n\nhostile work environment to prove “that a plan was in motion to\n\ncreate such an environment.”              That is, the dissent distinguished\n\n                                           16\n\fthe discrete action opposed by the Navy Federal plaintiff (the\n\nimminent    retaliatory        discharge      of   another       employee)       from   the\n\nconduct     opposed    in    Jordan    (conduct      that,       if    repeated,    could\n\namount to a hostile work environment).\n\n       The Jordan dissent concluded that, “[b]y opposing racially\n\ncharged conduct that he reasonably believes could be part and\n\nparcel of a hostile work environment, a reporting employee has\n\nopposed     the    impermissible       whole,      even    absent      an   independent\n\nbasis for believing the conduct might be repeated.”                         Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d   at   354.      “Indeed,”       the    dissent      emphasized,       “we   require\n\nemployees to report such incidents in order to prevent hostile\n\nwork environments from coming into being.”                           Id. (referring to\n\nemployer’s affirmative Ellerth/Faragher defense, see Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 807; Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S.\n\n742, 764-65 (1998), imposing duty on employee to avoid harm by\n\nreporting     harassment        to    employer).               The    dissent     further\n\nhighlighted precedent observing “that an employee’s ‘generalized\n\nfear   of    retaliation       does    not       excuse    a    failure     to    report’\n\nharassing conduct, because ‘Title VII expressly prohibits any\n\nretaliation         against         [employees]           for        reporting      . . .\n\nharassment.’”         Id. at 355 (alterations in original) (quoting\n\nBarrett v. Applied Radiant Energy Corp., 240 F.3d 262, 267 (4th\n\nCir.   2001)).        And,    the    dissent      stressed      the    Supreme    Court’s\n\nthen-recent       edict      that    “‘[i]nterpreting           the    antiretaliation\n\n                                            17\n\fprovision       to    provide     broad   protection         from   retaliation      helps\n\nassure    the        cooperation      upon    which    accomplishment        of   [Title\n\nVII’s] primary objective’ — preventing harm — ‘depends.’”                               Id.\n\nat 352 (alteration in original) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa\n\nFe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006)).\n\n      At bottom, the Jordan dissent recognized that the “black\n\nmonkeys” comment made by Jordan’s co-worker “is the stuff of\n\nwhich a racially hostile work environment is made,” and thus\n\nthat “it was entirely reasonable for Jordan to believe that, in\n\nreporting the . . . comment to his employers, he was opposing a\n\nracially hostile work environment.”                     Jordan, 458 F.3d at 355.\n\nThe   dissent        lamented     that,      because    of    the    panel   majority’s\n\nopinion     to       the   contrary,      “employees         in     this   Circuit      who\n\nexperience racially harassing conduct are faced with a ‘Catch-\n\n22.’”     Id.        As the dissent explained those employees’ quandary,\n\n“[t]hey may report such conduct to their employer at their peril\n\n(as Jordan did), or they may remain quiet and work in a racially\n\nhostile and degrading work environment, with no legal recourse\n\nbeyond resignation.”            Id.    But see Jordan, 458 F.3d at 342 (the\n\nmajority’s       retort     that      “Jordan’s       dilemma,      that   the    law    is\n\ninconsistent          by   both    encouraging         and     discouraging       ‘early’\n\nreporting, is presented too abstractly.                        The strong policy of\n\nremoving and preventing workplace discrimination can and does\n\ncoexist with Navy Federal’s objective reasonableness standard”).\n\n                                              18\n\fThe   opinion   of    the   Jordan    majority    thereafter     withstood    a\n\npetition for rehearing en banc, which was denied on a 5-5 vote\n\nof the judges then in active service.            See Jordan v. Alternative\n\nRes. Corp., 467 F.3d 378 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n                                      3.\n\n      Here, by its decision of April 5, 2013, the district court\n\nrelied on Jordan and awarded summary judgment to the defendants,\n\nadopting   their     contentions     that    Clubb’s   conduct   was   not   so\n\nsevere or pervasive as to create a hostile work environment or\n\nto instill a reasonable belief in Liberto, such as would protect\n\nher from retaliation, that she had been unlawfully harassed.\n\nSee Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., No. 1:12-cv-00212 (D.\n\nMd. Apr. 5, 2013), ECF No. 52. 3            In rejecting Liberto’s hostile\n\n\n      3\n       The district court’s grounds for awarding summary judgment\n— the lack of severe or pervasive conduct (element three of the\nhostile work environment claims) and a protected activity\n(element one of the retaliation claims) — were the sole grounds\nthat had been propounded by the defendants.       See supra Part\nI.B.1.   Regardless, the court acknowledged the balance of the\nelements of Liberto’s claims and accepted that they had been\nsatisfied. With respect to the hostile work environment claims,\nthat meant Liberto had shown unwelcome conduct (element one),\nbased on her race (element two), which, “[g]iven Clubb’s\nposition in Clarion’s management structure,” was imputable to\nthe employer (element four). See Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau\nCorp., No. 1:12-cv-00212, slip op. at 5 (D. Md. Apr. 5, 2013),\nECF No. 52. As for the retaliation claims, the court deemed it\n“indisputable” that the defendants took an adverse employment\naction against Liberto (element two) and that there was a causal\nlink between her racial harassment complaint and the adverse\nemployment action (element three). Id. at 7.\n\n\n\n                                      19\n\fwork   environment         claims,       the    district         court    determined     that\n\n“[t]he two incidents of use of a racial epithet, assuming they\n\noccurred as Liberto testified, simply do not comprise either\n\npervasive       or    severe     conduct,      however       unacceptable      they      are.”\n\nId. at 6.             The court explained that it had “compare[d] the\n\nevidence        in     this     case     to     that       in    [three      others]”     and\n\n“conclude[d] the conduct at issue here does not rise to the\n\nlevel of conduct found to be severe or pervasive in those Fourth\n\nCircuit cases.”           Id.

The district court then invoked Jordan for the\n\nproposition that an “isolated racist comment” is “‘a far cry\n\nfrom   . . .     an     environment       of    crude      and    racist    conditions     so\n\nsevere     or        pervasive    that        they     alter[]      the     conditions     of\n\n[plaintiff’s] employment.’”                   Id. (third alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Jordan, 458 F.3d at 340).                         In concomitantly rejecting\n\n                                               20\n\fLiberto’s retaliation claims, the court again looked to Jordan\n\nand ruled that “‘no objectively reasonable person could have\n\nbelieved that the [plaintiff’s work environment] was, or was\n\nsoon   going     to     be,   infected   by    severe       or    pervasive      racist,\n\nthreatening, or humiliating harassment.’”                    Id. at 8 (alteration\n\nin original) (quoting Jordan, 458 F.3d at 341).\n\n       Liberto     timely     noted    her     appeal,      and    the    matter     was\n\nreviewed   by     a    three-judge     panel   of    this    Court.        See    Boyer-\n\nLiberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., 752 F.3d 350 (4th Cir. 2014).\n\nThe    panel     decision     was   unanimous       that    the    defendants      were\n\nproperly   awarded        summary     judgment   on    Liberto’s         hostile   work\n\nenvironment claims, in that Clubb’s “use of [the term ‘porch\n\nmonkey’] twice in a period of two days in discussions about a\n\nsingle incident, was not, as a matter of law, so severe or\n\npervasive as to change the terms and conditions of Liberto’s\n\nemployment.”          Id. at 356.      The panel observed that Liberto had\n\n“not pointed to any Fourth Circuit case, nor could she, finding\n\nthe presence of a hostile work environment based on a single\n\nincident.”       Id. at 358 (comparing Jordan with Anderson, Conner,\n\nand Amirmokri).\n\n       The panel was split, however, with respect to Liberto’s\n\nretaliation claims.           The opinion of the panel majority validated\n\nthe district court’s summary judgment award on those claims,\n\nexplaining that, “if no objectively reasonable juror could have\n\n                                         21\n\ffound the presence of a hostile work environment, as we today\n\nhold, it stands to reason that Liberto also could not have had\n\nan objectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment\n\nexisted.”     Boyer-Liberto, 752 F.3d at 360 (emphasis omitted).\n\nAlthough    the   panel   majority        allowed   that    an     “employee’s\n\nopposition may be protected before the hostile environment has\n\nfully taken form,” the majority faulted Liberto for failing to\n\n“present any indicators that the situation at the Clarion would\n\nhave ripened into a hostile work environment.”                   Id.     In that\n\nregard, the majority equated Liberto’s case with Jordan.                      See\n\nid. (“Just as in Jordan, we conclude here that ‘while in the\n\nabstract, continued repetition of racial comments of the kind\n\n[Clubb] made might have led to a hostile work environment, no\n\nallegation in the [record] suggests that a plan was in motion to\n\ncreate such an environment, let alone that such an environment\n\nwas even likely to occur.’” (alterations in original) (quoting\n\nJordan, 458 F.3d at 340)); see also id. at 361 (Shedd, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“Based on this Court’s decision in Jordan . . . , I\n\nagree with Judge Niemeyer that summary judgment should . . . be\n\naffirmed on the retaliation claim.”).\n\n     The dissent distinguished the facts in this case from those\n\nin Jordan and concluded that, “[p]articularly in light of these\n\nsignificant   differences,   . . .    Liberto       could   have       reasonably\n\nbelieved that Clubb’s conduct was actionable.”               Boyer-Liberto,\n\n                                     22\n\f752    F.3d    at     363    (Traxler,           C.J.,      concurring     in     part      and\n\ndissenting in part) (pointing out that Jordan’s co-worker made a\n\nsingle comment not directed at Jordan or another employee, while\n\nClubb called Liberto herself “the very same name in the very\n\nsame   threatening      context”         on    two       consecutive     days).        In    any\n\nevent, the dissent also questioned whether Jordan was correctly\n\ndecided.        See    id.    (“I        share      in     the    sentiment     Judge       King\n\nexpressed so well in his dissent in Jordan that our very narrow\n\ninterpretation of what constitutes a reasonable belief in this\n\ncontext       has     placed        employees             who      experience         racially\n\ndiscriminatory        conduct       in     a     classic         ‘Catch-22’      situation.”\n\n(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       Following issuance of the panel’s decision, Liberto sought\n\nrehearing     en     banc,   and     a    majority         of    our   judges    in    regular\n\nactive service voted to grant Liberto’s petition.                               Accordingly,\n\nthe panel’s decision was vacated, and today our en banc Court\n\nassesses      anew    the    propriety         of    the    district     court’s      summary\n\njudgment award to the defendants.

See Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc).

See Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477\n\nU.S. 57, 65-67 (1986).         A hostile environment exists “[w]hen the\n\nworkplace     is      permeated      with         discriminatory    intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.”               Harris v.

That determination is made “by\n\nlooking      at    all        the    circumstances,”            which    “may    include      the\n\nfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether\n\nit is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;         and    whether        it    unreasonably         interferes         with    an\n\nemployee’s work performance.”                    Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.                It “is\n\nnot,   and    by        its    nature    cannot       be,   a     mathematically        precise\n\ntest.”    Id. at 22.\n\n       To be sure, viable hostile work environment claims often\n\ninvolve repeated conduct.                     See Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\n\nMorgan,    536      U.S.       101,    115-17    (2002).          That     is    because,     “in\n\ndirect contrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may\n\nnot be actionable on its own.”                   Id. at 115.            For example, “‘mere\n\nutterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelings\n\nin an employee’ does not sufficiently affect the conditions of\n\nemployment to implicate Title VII.”                             Harris, 510 U.S. at 21\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67).                                   The\n\nsame   goes       for    “simple       teasing    [and]         offhand    comments.”         See\n\nFaragher      v.    City       of     Boca    Raton,      524    U.S.     775,   788    (1998).\n\nImportantly, however, an “isolated incident[]” of harassment can\n\n“amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of\n\nemployment,”        if        that    incident    is      “extremely       serious.”          Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                26\n\f         In measuring the severity of harassing conduct, the status\n\nof   the     harasser    may    be   a     significant       factor       —    e.g.,     “a\n\nsupervisor’s       use   of    [a    racial          epithet]     impacts      the     work\n\nenvironment far more severely than use by co-equals.”                             Rodgers\n\nv.

Co.,   12    F.3d      668,   675    (7th    Cir.      1993).\n\nSimply put, “a supervisor’s power and authority invests his or\n\nher harassing conduct with a particular threatening character.”\n\nBurlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 763 (1998).\n\n         The status of the harasser also is relevant to element four\n\nof a hostile work environment claim, which necessitates proof\n\nthat the harassment is imputable to the employer.                             On the one\n\nhand, “[i]f the harassing employee is the victim’s co-worker,\n\nthe employer is liable only if it was negligent in controlling\n\nworking conditions.”           Vance v.

On the other hand, where the harasser is the victim’s\n\nsupervisor, “different rules apply”:                    The employer is strictly\n\nliable for the supervisor’s harassing behavior if it “culminates\n\nin   a    tangible    employment     action,”         but   otherwise      “may      escape\n\nliability     by     establishing,        as    an    affirmative        defense,      that\n\n(1) the      employer    exercised        reasonable        care    to    prevent       and\n\n                                           27\n\fcorrect      any     harassing            behavior          and    (2) that       the     plaintiff\n\nunreasonably        failed          to    take       advantage      of     the     preventive          or\n\ncorrective opportunities that the employer provided.”                                              Vance,\n\n133 S.

The Ellerth/Faragher defense, in essence,\n\nimposes      a     duty       on    the        victim       to    report     her       supervisor’s\n\nharassing        behavior      to        the    employer.

Ct. at 2446 n.8 (citing Ellerth, 524\n\nU.S.   at    762).        The     Vance       Court      determined       that    one    of    the\n\nharassers in Faragher “possessed the power to make employment\n\ndecisions having direct economic consequences for his victims”\n\nbased on the following:                 “No one [had been] hired without his\n\nrecommendation”; he “initiated firing and suspending personnel”;\n\nhis performance evaluations “translated into salary increases”;\n\nand    he    “made    recommendations                regarding         promotions.”            Id.\n\n(internal       quotation       marks     omitted).           Additionally,           the    Court\n\nobserved that, “even if an employer concentrates all decision-\n\nmaking      authority      in     a    few     individuals,          it   likely      will     not\n\nisolate     itself    from        heightened            liability    under       Faragher      and\n\nEllerth,” in that those individuals likely will have to rely on\n\nthe recommendations of others, and “the employer may be held to\n\n                                                29\n\fhave effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment\n\nactions to the employees on whose recommendations it relies.”\n\nId. at 2452 (citing Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 762).\n\n                                                2.\n\n     In    seeking       summary          judgment         on    Liberto’s       hostile      work\n\nenvironment      claims,       the       defendants’        sole      contention       was    that\n\nthere had been no showing that Clubb’s conduct was severe or\n\npervasive enough to alter Liberto’s conditions of employment and\n\nproduce     an       abusive       work       environment.             Liberto’s        counter-\n\narguments    included          that      there       was    a    genuine     dispute       as    to\n\nwhether the          harassment         she   suffered          on   September    14    and     15,\n\n2010, was sufficiently severe.                     To resolve that issue today, we\n\nneed not — and, in any event, on this record cannot — determine\n\nwhether Clubb was actually Liberto’s supervisor or simply her\n\nco-worker,       a    fact   relevant         to     the    separate       question      of     the\n\nClarion’s vicarious liability.                     Nevertheless, we are obliged to\n\nconsider how Clubb portrayed her authority and what Liberto thus\n\nreasonably believed Clubb’s power to be.                              See Oncale, 523 U.S.\n\nat 81 (“[T]he objective severity of harassment should be judged\n\nfrom the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s\n\nposition . . . .”).\n\n     The     defendants            have       suggested          that,     because       Liberto\n\nunderstood       Clubb       to     be    a     “glorified           hostess”     and    not     a\n\nrestaurant       manager,         see    J.A.    213-14,         Liberto    could      not    have\n\n                                                30\n\freasonably perceived that Clubb’s conduct was severe enough to\n\ncreate       a    hostile    work     environment.      That   premise      ignores\n\nevidence,         however,     that     Clubb   repeatedly     and    effectively\n\ncommunicated to Liberto prior to September 14, 2010, that Clubb\n\nhad Dr. Berger’s ear and could have Liberto fired.                     See, e.g.,\n\nid. at 274 (Liberto’s deposition testimony that Clubb “did have\n\npower that I did not have”); id. at 279 (“I felt extremely\n\nsingled out and that my position was being threatened and it was\n\nvery clear.”); id. (“I was told what my place was.                     . . .    And\n\n[Clubb] always made it clear that Dr. Berger would listen to\n\nanything she said and wouldn’t believe me.”).\n\n       The       defendants’   theory    also   fails   to   take    into   account\n\nClubb’s assertion of power in the course of her harassment of\n\nLiberto.          On September 14, 2010, Clubb berated Liberto’s job\n\nperformance before threatening “to get [her]” and “make [her]\n\nsorry,” and then calling her a “damn porch monkey” or a “dang\n\nporch monkey.”         See J.A. 252-53, 258.         The following day, Clubb\n\nobstructed Liberto’s attempted report of racial harassment to\n\nFood and Beverage Director Heubeck by telling Liberto, “I need\n\nto speak to you, little girl,” and “I’m more important [than\n\nHeubeck].”         Id. at 263-64.       Immediately thereafter, Clubb again\n\nreprimanded Liberto, again threatened to “get [her]” and to “go\n\nto Dr. Berger,” and again called her a “porch monkey.”                      Id. at\n\n266.     Finally, while speaking with Liberto on September 18 about\n\n                                           31\n\fher racial harassment complaint, General Manager Elman validated\n\nClubb’s      assertion       of    authority       by       declaring      Clubb    to    be\n\nLiberto’s “boss.”          Id. at 324.\n\n      Properly        considering    that    evidence,         we    must    accept      that\n\nLiberto believed — and reasonably so — that Clubb could make a\n\ndischarge       decision     or    recommendation           that    would    be     rubber-\n\nstamped by Dr. Berger.             Thus, in gauging the severity of Clubb’s\n\nconduct, we deem Clubb to have been Liberto’s supervisor.                                Cf.\n\nVance,    133    S.    Ct.   at    2446   n.8,     2452      (recognizing      that,     for\n\npurposes of employer’s vicarious liability, employee may qualify\n\nas supervisor if she can initiate tangible employment actions\n\n“subject        to     approval      by      higher          management”       or        make\n\nrecommendations on which employer relies).                         And we view Clubb’s\n\nconduct    as    having      the   “particular          threatening        character”     of\n\nharassment perpetrated by a supervisor against her subordinate.\n\nSee Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 763.                    That perspective is especially\n\nappropriate here, where Clubb employed racial epithets to cap\n\nexplicit, angry threats that she was on the verge of utilizing\n\nher supervisory powers to terminate Liberto’s employment.\n\n      We also grasp that the use of Clubb’s chosen slur — “porch\n\nmonkey” — is about as odious as the use of the word “nigger.”\n\nSee Spriggs, 242 F.3d at 185.                    The latter epithet, of course,\n\n“is   pure      anathema     to    African-Americans.”               Id.

Franklin Nat’l Bank of\n\nMinneapolis, 459 F.3d 903, 911 (8th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that\n\n“[p]rimate    rhetoric       has   been     used      to   intimidate       African-\n\nAmericans” and that “[t]he use of the term ‘monkey’ and other\n\nsimilar    words,”    including     the    variation       “porch    monkey,”     has\n\n“been part of actionable racial harassment claims across the\n\ncountry”    (citing   cases)).        As   we   and    several      of   our   sister\n\ncourts of appeals have recognized, “‘[p]erhaps no single act can\n\nmore quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously\n\nracial epithet such as “nigger” by a supervisor in the presence\n\nof   his   subordinates.’”         Spriggs,     242    F.3d   at     185    (quoting\n\nRodgers, 12 F.3d at 675); accord Ellis v. Houston, 742 F.3d 307,\n\n325-26 (8th Cir. 2014); Ayissi-Etoh v. Fannie Mae, 712 F.3d 572,\n\n577 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Rivera v.

GTE Serv.\n\nCorp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1116 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n      Consequently, a reasonable jury could find that Clubb’s two\n\nuses of the “porch monkey” epithet — whether viewed as a single\n\nincident or as a pair of discrete instances of harassment — were\n\nsevere enough to engender a hostile work environment.                      Cf. Adams\n\n                                       33\n\fv.

We also acknowledge\n\nthat this is a first for our Court.                           We reject, however, any\n\nnotion that our prior decisions, including Jordan v. Alternative\n\nResources        Corp.,    were     meant    to    require           more       than    a    single\n\nincident of harassment in every viable hostile work environment\n\ncase.           Specifically,       we     observe        that       the        district         court\n\nimproperly analogized this matter (involving a racial epithet\n\n                                             34\n\fdirected at Liberto by her supervisor) to Jordan (concerning a\n\nracist remark that was made by a mere co-worker and not aimed at\n\nJordan or any other employee).            See 458 F.3d 332, 339-40 (4th\n\nCir. 2006).    We further note that, in the cases unfavorably\n\ncompared to this one by the district court, the harassment was\n\nso severe and pervasive that there were no close calls.                     See\n\nAnderson v. G.D.C., Inc., 281 F.3d 452, 459 (4th Cir. 2002)\n\n(“The    evidence    was   unquestionably          sufficient     to    submit\n\nAnderson’s hostile environment claim to the jury.”); Conner v.\n\nSchrader-Bridgeport Int’l, Inc., 227 F.3d 179, 199 (4th Cir.\n\n2000) (“[T]here is ample support for the jury finding of severe\n\nor pervasive conduct sufficient to constitute a hostile work\n\nenvironment.”);     Amirmokri   v.

Liberto’s case may be\n\ndifferent from Anderson, Conner, and Amirmokri, but it is no\n\nless worthy of a jury trial. 4\n\n\n     4\n       We do not suggest that a jury should be limited to\nassessing whether Clubb’s two uses of the “porch monkey” slur,\nwithout more, created a hostile work environment.    A jury also\nwould be entitled to consider other evidence potentially\nindicative of severe or pervasive harassment, including Clubb’s\ntreatment of Liberto throughout her short tenure at the Clarion;\nClubb’s shouting, spitting, and stalking on the night of\nSeptember 14, 2010; and Clubb’s use of the term “little girl” to\nrefer to Liberto on September 15.   See, e.g., Conner, 227 F.3d\nat 197 (“The more serious incidents enumerated here were\ncomplemented  by   numerous  additional  occurrences   that,  in\n(Continued)\n                                     35\n\f                                      B.\n\n                                      1.\n\n     Turning     to     Liberto’s     retaliation     claims,       Title   VII\n\nproscribes     discrimination       against   an    employee    because,     in\n\nrelevant part, she “has opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\nemployment practice by this subchapter.”               42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n3(a).

We need not consider\nthat question today, however, because the defendants have raised\nno issue with respect to causation.\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\femployee       is    protected      from   retaliation         when     she    opposes     a\n\nhostile work environment that, although not fully formed, is in\n\nprogress.\n\n                                             a.\n\n       The panel majority in Jordan ruled that, where an employee\n\nhas    complained      to     his   employer       of    an   isolated        incident    of\n\nharassment insufficient to create a hostile work environment,\n\nthe employee cannot have possessed a reasonable belief that a\n\nTitle VII violation was in progress, absent evidence “that a\n\nplan was in motion to create such an environment” or “that such\n\nan environment was [otherwise] likely to occur.”                          See 458 F.3d\n\nat 340.        We reject that aspect of Jordan today, however, for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n       First    of    all,    the    Jordan       standard     “imagines       a   fanciful\n\nworld    where       bigots    announce      their       intentions     to     repeatedly\n\nbelittle racial minorities at the outset, and it ignores the\n\npossibility that a hostile work environment could evolve without\n\nsome    specific      intention      to    alter     the      working    conditions       of\n\nAfrican-Americans through racial harassment.”                         See Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d at 353-54 (King, J., dissenting).                         Tellingly, intent to\n\ncreate a hostile work environment is not an element of a hostile\n\nenvironment claim.\n\n       The   Jordan     standard      also    is    at    odds   with    the       hope   and\n\nexpectation that employees will report harassment early, before\n\n                                             38\n\fit rises to the level of a hostile environment.                                         Where the\n\nharasser is her supervisor and no tangible employment action has\n\nbeen    taken,      the     victim      is    compelled          by    the    Ellerth/Faragher\n\ndefense to make an internal complaint, i.e., “to take advantage\n\nof any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\n\nemployer.”          See   Faragher,          524    U.S.    at        807.      Similarly,       the\n\nvictim    of    a    co-worker’s          harassment        is        prudent    to     alert    her\n\nemployer in order to ensure that, if the harassment continues,\n\nshe can establish the negligence necessary to impute liability.\n\nSee Vance, 133 S. Ct. at 2453.                         The reporting obligation is\n\nessential      to     accomplishing           Title     VII’s          “primary        objective,”\n\nwhich    is    “not    to    provide         redress       but    to     avoid    harm.”         See\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 806.                    Thus, we have recognized that the\n\nvictim is commanded to “report the misconduct, not investigate,\n\ngather    evidence,         and   then       approach       company          officials.”         See\n\nMatvia v. Bald Head Island Mgmt., Inc., 259 F.3d 261, 269 (4th\n\nCir.    2001).        Further,       we      have    emphasized         that     an     employee’s\n\n“generalized fear of retaliation does not excuse a failure to\n\nreport       . . .     harassment,”            particularly             where         “Title     VII\n\nexpressly      prohibits          any     retaliation            against        [the    reporting\n\nemployee].”         See Barrett, 240 F.3d at 267.\n\n       But    rather      than    encourage          the    early       reporting        vital    to\n\nachieving Title VII’s goal of avoiding harm, the Jordan standard\n\ndeters harassment victims from speaking up by depriving them of\n\n                                                39\n\ftheir       statutory       entitlement           to        protection      from    retaliation.\n\nSuch    a     lack   of     protection           is    no    inconsequential        matter,      for\n\n“fear       of   retaliation          is    the       leading      reason    why    people      stay\n\nsilent        instead      of    voicing          their        concerns      about       bias    and\n\ndiscrimination.”               See Crawford v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville &\n\nDavidson         Cnty.,     Tenn.,         555    U.S.        271,    279    (2009)      (internal\n\nquotation        marks     omitted).             Quelling          that   fear,    the    Crawford\n\nCourt extended protection “to an employee who speaks out about\n\ndiscrimination           not    on     her       own       initiative,      but    in    answering\n\nquestions during an employer’s internal investigation.”                                    See id.\n\nat 273.          To do otherwise, the Court explained, would “create a\n\nreal    dilemma       for      any    knowledgeable            employee.”          Id.    at    279.\n\nNamely, “[i]f the employee reported discrimination in response\n\nto the enquiries, the employer might well be free to penalize\n\nher     for      speaking       up.         But        if    she     kept   quiet       about   the\n\ndiscrimination and later filed a Title VII claim, the employer\n\nmight well escape liability [by invoking the Ellerth/Faragher\n\ndefense].”           Id.       The Court concluded that “[n]othing in the\n\nstatute’s text or our precedent supports this catch-22.”                                         Id.\n\nOf course, the same can be, and has been, said about the Jordan\n\nstandard.         See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 355 (King, J., dissenting)\n\n(“As a result of today’s decision, employees in this Circuit who\n\nexperience racially harassing conduct are faced with a ‘Catch-\n\n22.’”).\n\n                                                      40\n\f       Put succinctly, the Jordan standard is incompatible with\n\nCrawford, as well as other Supreme Court decisions directing\n\nthat Title VII’s antiretaliation provision be interpreted “to\n\nprovide broad protection from retaliation.”                     See Burlington N. &\n\nSanta Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006); see also,\n\ne.g., Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 173-75\n\n(2011).      As the Burlington Northern Court explained, Title VII\n\nmust   be    read     “to   provide     broader       protection    for     victims    of\n\nretaliation than for [even] victims of race-based, ethnic-based,\n\nreligion-based,          or      gender-based          discrimination,”          because\n\n“effective enforcement could . . . only be expected if employees\n\nfelt free to approach officials with their grievances.”                          See 548\n\nU.S. at 66-67 (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       Finally,     we    need   look   no   further      than     Jordan     itself   to\n\ncomprehend that the Jordan standard is unsuited to its purpose.\n\nIn Jordan’s presence, his co-worker made a comment that, “in a\n\nsingle      breath,      . . .    equated        African-Americans        with    ‘black\n\nmonkeys’ and ‘black apes,’ and implied a savage, bestial sexual\n\npredilection        acutely      insulting       to   members      of   the      African-\n\nAmerican community.”             See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 351 (King, J.,\n\ndissenting).        Jordan then did exactly what Title VII hopes and\n\nexpects:      He reported the comment to his employers in an effort\n\nto avert any further racial harassment.                   Because of his internal\n\ncomplaint, however, Jordan was fired.                   In light of the text and\n\n                                            41\n\fpurpose of Title VII, as well as controlling Supreme Court and\n\nFourth Circuit decisions, Jordan surely merited protection from\n\nretaliation.       That is,\n\n     [w]ithout question, [the comment made by Jordan’s co-\n     worker] is the stuff of which a racially hostile work\n     environment is made. On the allegations here, it was\n     entirely reasonable for Jordan to believe that, in\n     reporting the racially charged ‘black monkeys’ comment\n     to his employers, he was opposing a racially hostile\n     work environment.\n\nId. at 355 (citations omitted).               But, by devising and applying\n\nthe Jordan standard, we denied Jordan any legal recourse for his\n\nretaliatory       discharge.        In   these     circumstances,         the    Jordan\n\nstandard plainly cannot endure.\n\n                                         b.\n\n     The   question,       then,    becomes       this:      What    is    the    proper\n\nstandard   for     determining      whether       an   employee     who    reports   an\n\nisolated incident of harassment has a reasonable belief that she\n\nis opposing a hostile work environment in progress?                       We conclude\n\nthat, when assessing the reasonableness of an employee’s belief\n\nthat a hostile environment is occurring based on an isolated\n\nincident, the focus should be on the severity of the harassment.\n\nCf. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270-71\n\n(2001) (looking to severity of single incident in evaluating\n\nreasonableness       of    employee’s        belief       that   incident        created\n\nactionable hostile environment).               That assessment thus involves\n\nfactors    used     to    judge    whether    a    workplace        is    sufficiently\n\n                                         42\n\fhostile or abusive for purposes of a hostile environment claim —\n\nspecifically, whether the discriminatory conduct “is physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance.”                          See\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 23.            Of course, a single offensive utterance\n\n—    e.g.,     “simple     teasing”       or     an   “offhand     comment[],”       see\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 788 — generally will not create a hostile\n\nenvironment without significant repetition or an escalation in\n\nthe harassment’s severity.                See Ayissi-Etoh, 712 F.3d at 579\n\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“The more severe the harassment,\n\nthe less pervasive it needs to be, and vice versa.” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).                But an isolated incident that is\n\nphysically threatening or humiliating will be closer — even if\n\nnot equal — to the type of conduct actionable on its own because\n\nit is “extremely serious.”              See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788.\n\n       Accordingly,       as   relevant     here,     an     employee    will     have   a\n\nreasonable belief that a hostile work environment is occurring\n\nbased on an isolated incident if that harassment is physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating.                This standard is consistent not\n\nonly   with       Clark   County,    but       also   with    other     Supreme    Court\n\nprecedent, including Crawford and Burlington Northern.                          That is\n\nso   because      it   protects    an    employee     like    Jordan     who    promptly\n\nspeaks up “to attack the racist cancer in his workplace,” rather\n\nthan “remain[ing] silent” and “thereby allowing [discriminatory]\n\nconduct      to     continue      unchallenged,”        while     “forfeiting        any\n\n                                           43\n\fjudicial remedy he might have.”              See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 356\n\n(King, J., dissenting).\n\n     In   sum,     under   the    standard    that   we   adopt    today   with\n\nguidance from the Supreme Court, an employee is protected from\n\nretaliation for opposing an isolated incident of harassment when\n\nshe reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in\n\nprogress, with no requirement for additional evidence that a\n\nplan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an\n\nenvironment   is    likely   to    occur.     The    employee     will   have   a\n\nreasonable belief that a hostile environment is occurring if the\n\nisolated incident is physically threatening or humiliating. 6\n\n\n     6\n       Notably, in its brief as amicus curiae supporting Liberto,\nthe EEOC urges us to adopt a standard suggested by the Jordan\ndissent:    that an employee engages in a protected opposition\nactivity when she complains about an isolated incident of\nharassment that would create a hostile work environment if\nrepeated often enough.    See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 354 (King, J.,\ndissenting) (“When the cumulative nature of such an environment\nis properly considered, it is clear that employees are protected\nunder Title VII from employer retaliation if they oppose conduct\nthat,    if   repeated,   could   amount   to   a   hostile  work\nenvironment.”).    When the isolated incident is merely offensive\n— rather than physically threatening or humiliating — the if-\nrepeated standard might well be appropriate.      Contrary to the\nargument of the defendants, it is not necessarily precluded by\nthe Supreme Court’s Clark County decision.      That is, although\nthe Court concluded that the Clark County plaintiff had not\nengaged in a protected opposition activity by reporting an\nisolated incident that was merely offensive, the Court did so by\nassessing whether the plaintiff could have reasonably believed\nthat incident alone created a hostile environment.     See 121 S.\nCt. at 270-71. The Court did not consider whether the plaintiff\ncould have reasonably believed that a hostile work environment,\neven though not fully formed, was in progress. In any event, we\n(Continued)\n                                      44\n\f                                             2.\n\n       Because        the    defendants        contested       Liberto’s          retaliation\n\nclaims on the lone ground that she did not engage in a protected\n\nactivity, our analysis is limited to whether a jury could find\n\nthat    Liberto       reasonably        believed     there      was        a    hostile      work\n\nenvironment in progress when she reported Clubb’s use of the\n\n“porch monkey” slur.              Applying the standard that we adopt today,\n\nthe answer plainly is “yes.”                      As we recognized in analyzing\n\nLiberto’s hostile work environment claims, “porch monkey” is a\n\nracial epithet that is not just humiliating, but “degrading and\n\nhumiliating in the extreme.”                     See Spriggs, 242 F.3d at 185.\n\nIndeed, we determined that a reasonable jury could find that\n\nClubb’s    two    uses       of    “porch    monkey”         were    serious       enough       to\n\nengender    a    hostile       environment.             We    must    further       conclude,\n\ntherefore,       in    the    context       of    the    retaliation            claims,      that\n\nLiberto    has    made      the    lesser    showing         that    the       harassment     was\n\nsufficiently      severe          to   render     reasonable         her       belief    that    a\n\nhostile environment was occurring.                      Accordingly, we vacate the\n\nsummary    judgment         award      on   Liberto’s        retaliation          claims,       in\n\naddition    to    her       hostile     work     environment         claims.            We   also\n\n\n\nneed not decide herein whether to embrace the if-repeated\nstandard   for   cases involving isolated, merely offensive\nincidents of harassment, because this matter involves more\nserious conduct.\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\funderscore       that,         on     remand,     a   jury      would    be     entitled       to\n\nsimultaneously reject the hostile work environment claims on the\n\nground    that       Clubb’s        conduct     was   not      sufficiently        serious    to\n\namount    to     a    hostile         environment,        but    award    relief         on   the\n\nretaliation claims by finding that Clubb’s conduct was severe\n\nenough    to     give      Liberto       a     reasonable       belief    that     a     hostile\n\nenvironment, although not fully formed, was in progress.\n\n                                                 C.\n\n       Our good dissenting colleague has a different view of the\n\ncontrolling law, the relevant facts, and even what our en banc\n\nmajority does and does not say.                       See post at 68-106 (Niemeyer,\n\nJ., dissenting).               With respect to the hostile work environment\n\nclaims, there is disagreement over what the Supreme Court meant\n\nby this sentence from Faragher:\n\n       A recurring    point   in  [our  hostile  environment]\n       opinions is that simple teasing, offhand comments, and\n       isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not\n       amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and\n       conditions of employment.\n\nSee 524 U.S. at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted).                                 We read\n\nthat     sentence         to     pronounce       that     an     isolated       incident      of\n\nharassment,          if     extremely          serious,        can   create        a     hostile\n\nenvironment.              But,      clinging     to   Faragher’s        use   of       “isolated\n\nincidents” in the plural, the dissent posits that only multiple,\n\n“extremely       serious            isolated     incidents       . . .    may      produce      a\n\nhostile work environment.”                   Post at 88.\n\n                                                 46\n\f      Clearly, it is the dissent’s interpretation of Faragher —\n\nnot   ours    —   that        is   untenable.       To   illustrate,        the   dissent\n\nelsewhere observes that a hostile environment claim “must be\n\n‘based on the cumulative effect of individual acts,’” post at 71\n\n(quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115), and that, “to be actionable\n\nunder Title VII, conduct must be so ‘severe or pervasive’ as ‘to\n\nalter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an\n\nabusive      working      environment,’”           id.   at     70   (alteration        in\n\noriginal) (emphasis added) (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67).\n\nStrikingly, the dissent does not — and surely cannot — explain\n\nwhat differentiates “isolated incidents” that must be “extremely\n\nserious,”      from      “individual        acts”    that     may    be     “severe    or\n\npervasive.”       The dissent also quotes from Morgan that “‘a single\n\nact of harassment may not be actionable on its own,’” id. at 71\n\n(quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115), without acknowledging the\n\nobvious      import      of    Morgan’s      use    of   “may    not”     rather      than\n\n“cannot.”         And,    the      dissent    itself     allows      that    a    single,\n\nisolated incident of physical violence may be actionable, id. at\n\n88, without even attempting to reconcile that proposition with\n\nits reading of Faragher.\n\n      Relatedly, the dissent criticizes us for “fail[ing] to note\n\nthat the portions of Faragher to which [we] cite[] were part of\n\nthe    Supreme        Court’s        much     lengthier       discussion          —   and\n\nsubstantively different message — describing the type of conduct\n\n                                             47\n\fthat would not violate Title VII.”              Post at 69.        In pursuing its\n\nposition, the dissent simply ignores Faragher’s use of “unless\n\nextremely serious” to designate an exception to those isolated\n\nincidents that are not unlawful on their own.\n\n     Meanwhile,      the   dissent       repeatedly          invokes    Faragher’s\n\nobservation,   “Mere    utterance     of    an    ethnic      or   racial    epithet\n\nwhich   engenders    offensive     feelings      in    an    employee   would    not\n\nsufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to violate\n\nTitle VII.”    See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).       But the dissent overemphasizes the first part\n\nof that sentence, at one point quoting the entire sentence while\n\nunderscoring   only    “[m]ere     utterance      of    an    ethnic    or   racial\n\nepithet,” see post at 69, and at another point actually omitting\n\nthe phrase “which engenders offensive feelings in an employee,”\n\nsee id. at 88.      Of course, the phrase “which engenders offensive\n\nfeelings in an employee” is a critical qualifier, signifying “a\n\nmere offensive utterance” rather than a more egregious slur that\n\nis “physically threatening or humiliating.”                   See Faragher, 524\n\nU.S. at 787-88 (explaining that the circumstances relevant to\n\ndetermining “whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or\n\nabusive”   include     “‘whether    it     is    physically        threatening   or\n\nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance’” (quoting Harris,\n\n510 U.S. at 23)).\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\f       In       any    event,   the    dissent   consistently      minimizes   the\n\nseriousness of Clubb’s two uses of the “porch monkey” slur by\n\ndeeming them to be merely offensive as a matter of law.                     To do\n\nso, the dissent invents a test under which harassment cannot\n\nrise       to    the    level   of    humiliating   unless    it    is   “publicly\n\nhumiliating,” and points out that “it appears that no one heard\n\nClubb direct the epithet at Liberto on either occasion.”                       See\n\npost at 88-89.           The dissent also flouts our mandate to view the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to Liberto, and insists that,\n\nas a fact, “Liberto thought that she was being upbraided by a\n\nco-worker, not her supervisor.”                Id. at 89.    Regardless of what\n\nelse Liberto perceived about Clubb’s status, however, there is\n\nample evidence in the record showing that Liberto reasonably\n\nbelieved that Clubb possessed the one supervisory power that\n\nmattered:         the power to follow through on her threats to have\n\nDr. Berger rubber-stamp Liberto’s discharge. 7\n\n\n       7\n       Notably, although the defendants themselves failed to\nargue in the district court that Clubb was not actually\nLiberto’s supervisor, the dissent wanders into that issue and\ndeclares it “highly doubtful that Clubb . . . would qualify as\nLiberto’s supervisor.”   See post at 84-85 (describing Clubb as\n“an employee whose only influence comes from having the ear of\nthe company’s owner because of their personal friendship”). The\ndissent’s characterization of Clubb is contradicted by portions\nof the record, including the September 18, 2010 email in which\nElman, the Clarion’s General Manager, recounted responding to\nLiberto’s racial harassment complaint by advising her that she\nand Clubb “need[ed] to learn to work together on a professional\nlevel and that [Clubb] was [Liberto’s] boss.” J.A. 324. Rather\n(Continued)\n                                          49\n\f       As for the retaliation claims, the dissent accuses our en\n\nbanc    majority   of   “gratuitously   proceed[ing]   to   adopt   an\n\nunprecedented standard . . . that is much broader than necessary\n\nto resolve Liberto’s claim[s].”         Post at 93.    The dissent’s\n\naccusation rests on the false premise that we hold as a matter\n\nof law that a hostile work environment existed.        In reality, we\n\nsimply conclude that a reasonable jury could find for Liberto\n\nwith respect to her hostile environment claims.        Because it is\n\npossible that Liberto will instead come up short at trial on\n\nthose claims, our retaliation analysis is essential.        Indeed, we\n\nhave emphasized that a jury may find that Clubb’s conduct was\n\ninsufficiently serious to engender a hostile environment, but\n\nsevere enough to protect Liberto from retaliation by rendering\n\nreasonable her belief that such an environment was underway.\n\n\n\n\nthan grappling with that important evidence from the Clarion’s\nown General Manager, the dissent chastises us for considering\nwhat it glibly terms “Elman’s apparent understanding of Clubb’s\nrelationship to Liberto.” See post at 86 n.*.\n\n     Meanwhile, two other of our good colleagues deem Clubb to\nhave been Liberto’s mere co-worker and thereby conclude that the\nClarion cannot be held vicariously liable for Clubb’s harassment\nof Liberto.    See post at 56-58 (Wilkinson, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part, joined by Agee, J.).          Those\ncolleagues not only disregard evidence that Clubb was Liberto’s\nsupervisor, but also urge affirmance of the summary judgment\naward with respect to the hostile environment claims on a ground\nthat the defendants failed to raise or preserve in the district\ncourt.\n\n\n\n                                  50\n\f       Unfortunately, there are further instances of the dissent’s\n\ninaccurate portrayal of today’s decision.                          For example, although\n\nwe observe herein that our standard “protects an employee like\n\nJordan” from retaliation, the dissent asserts that we nowhere\n\n“indicate that the plaintiff in Jordan had a reasonable belief\n\nthat a hostile work environment was taking shape at the time he\n\nreported       his    co-worker’s       racist         comment     to    his    supervisors.”\n\nSee post at 99.            So, for the sake of clarity (though too late to\n\nbenefit Jordan himself), we state in plain terms that a jury\n\napplying our standard could have found that Jordan reasonably\n\nbelieved       he    was     opposing      a    hostile       environment       in   progress.\n\nThat is because the “black monkeys” comment uttered to Jordan —\n\nlike the “porch monkey” slurs aimed at Liberto — could readily\n\nbe deemed physically threatening or humiliating.\n\n       We are entirely unswayed by the dissent’s warning that our\n\nstandard       “will       generate     widespread           litigation     over      the    many\n\noffensive workplace comments made everyday that employees find\n\nto   be    humiliating.”             See       post    at    93-94.       Our     standard    is\n\nimplicated          solely    when    an       employee        suffers    retaliation        for\n\nengaging in an oppositional activity, and can be satisfied only\n\nby showing the objective reasonableness of the employee’s belief\n\nthat      an    isolated         incident         of     harassment         was      physically\n\nthreatening          or    humiliating.           We        also   reject      the   dissent’s\n\nprediction          that   our   “standard        will       surely     generate      many    new\n\n                                                 51\n\fquestions” and “much hand-wringing” over which harassing conduct\n\nqualifies as sufficiently severe.               See id. at 96, 105.         Judges\n\nand juries have been identifying what is humiliating, as well as\n\nwhat is physically threatening or merely offensive, since at\n\nleast 1993, when the Supreme Court explained in Harris how to\n\ndetermine whether a workplace is objectively hostile or abusive\n\nfor purposes of a hostile environment claim.                   See 510 U.S. at\n\n23. 8\n\n        Finally, we are perplexed and dismayed by the dissent’s\n\nassertions that, on the one hand, “Liberto had every right to be\n\noffended by Clubb’s use of a racial epithet and acted reasonably\n\nand responsibly in reporting the incident,” see post at 98, and\n\nthat, on the other hand, Liberto spoke up too soon and thereby\n\ndeprived herself of protection from retaliation.                 As the dissent\n\nwould have it, although reporting Clubb’s slur was a sensible\n\nthing       to   do,    Liberto    should      have   waited    for     additional\n\nharassment       to    occur   —   but   not   so   much   harassment    that   the\n\n\n        8\n       Two of our colleagues issue dire warnings that today’s\ndecision may cause “employers [to] become speech police,”\n“employees [to be] estranged from one another,” and “companies\n[to] become private sector analogues of the surveillance state.”\nSee post at 55 (Wilkinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part, joined by Agee, J.). We cannot agree, however, that by\nsimply protecting an employee who, for example, reports a race-\nbased comment that she reasonably believes to be physically\nthreatening or humiliating, we might somehow silence or\nsegregate the workforce.\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fClarion could avoid vicarious liability because of a lack of\n\ntimely notice.        Concomitantly, the dissent contends that our\n\ndecision     “manifests      a   fundamental      distrust        of    employers,\n\nassuming    that,    once    a   humiliating     epithet     is    uttered,    the\n\ndevelopment of a hostile work environment is a fait accompli —\n\nin other words, that employers are powerless or unwilling to\n\nprevent a descent into pervasive hostility.”              Id. at 105.\n\n     Contrary to the dissent, we seek to promote the hope and\n\nexpectation — ingrained in our civil rights laws and the Supreme\n\nCourt decisions interpreting them — that employees will report\n\nharassment early, so that their employers can stop it before it\n\nrises to the level of a hostile environment.                      Employers are\n\npowerless    in     that    regard   only   if    they     are     unaware    that\n\nharassment is occurring.          But employees will understandably be\n\nwary of reporting abuse for fear of retribution.                   Under today’s\n\ndecision, employees who reasonably perceive an incident to be\n\nphysically threatening or humiliating do not have to wait for\n\nfurther     harassment      before   they   can    seek    help        from   their\n\nemployers without exposing themselves to retaliation.\n\n\n\n\n                                      53\n\f                              IV.\n\n     Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for such other and further proceedings\n\nas may be appropriate.\n\n                                            VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               54\n\fWILKINSON, Circuit Judge, with whom AGEE, Circuit Judge, joins,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n       The remarks alleged in this Title VII action are ones that\n\nAmericans of every race and all walks of life would find so\n\nwounding    that   the     word      offensive     does    not    begin     to   describe\n\nthem. It is incidents such as these, small as they may appear,\n\nthat   prevent     our    larger      society      from   becoming      the      place    of\n\nwelcome it needs to be.\n\n       The good done by the civil rights laws has been enormous\n\nand one aim of those laws, as I understand it, is to make the\n\nworkplace    an     environment          where     Americans       of      every     race,\n\nreligion, sex, or national origin would actually want to work.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 and 2000e-3.\n\n       To say that a good workplace environment is poisoned by the\n\nkind of remarks alleged here is an understatement. Who would\n\nwish   to   get    up    and    come     to    work   each       morning    fearful       of\n\nencountering this sort of slur during the course of the working\n\nday?\n\n       There is a countervailing danger at play in these cases,\n\nhowever,    namely       that   we    not     imbue   the       workplace     with      such\n\nstringent hostile work environment requirements that employers\n\nbecome   speech    police,        that   employees        are    estranged       from    one\n\nanother, and that companies become private sector analogues of\n\nthe surveillance state.\n\n\n                                              55\n\f       Where and how to strike the balance? In this case I would\n\ndecline to hold the employer vicariously liable on the merits of\n\nthe hostile work environment claim, but I would allow Boyer-\n\nLiberto’s retaliation claim to proceed. In fact, were the truth\n\nof her complaint ascertained by the employer, the “retaliation”\n\nshould have taken the form of Clubb’s dismissal and not Boyer-\n\nLiberto’s.\n\n\n\n                                          I.\n\n       As to the merits of the hostile work environment claim, I\n\nwould affirm the judgment of the district court on the grounds\n\nthat   any   other   result       would   stretch    the    notion    of    vicarious\n\nemployer     liability   past      the    breaking   point.    There       may   be   an\n\nunderstandable temptation to land hard on this employer, but\n\nthere are dangers down the road. Holding employers liable for\n\nremarks made by one of their employees where the majority points\n\nto   no   prior   notice     to    the    employer    and    no     prior    employer\n\nawareness of Clubb’s racist tendencies is all too open-ended. To\n\nbe   sure,   an   employer    is    “directly    liable”      for    a   co-worker’s\n\nunlawful harassment if “the employer was negligent with respect\n\nto the offensive behavior.” Vance v. Ball State Univ., 133 S.\n\nCt. 2434, 2441 (2013). But while the majority tries to make it\n\nappear as though some other evidence of employer malfeasance may\n\nbe somewhere in the offing, see Maj. Op. at 35 n.4, its opinion\n\n                                          56\n\fis wholly focused on the two incidents and remarks at issue and\n\nintent     on    directing     a   trial     where    the     element    of     imputed\n\nemployer liability has not been placed genuinely in dispute.\n\n     Whatever hazy ground Clubb may occupy between co-worker and\n\nsupervisor,       the    hazards    of     imposing       employer    liability    for\n\nremarks    made    by    mid-level       workers     in    workforces     that   might\n\nnumber     in    the    hundreds      or    even     thousands       pushes     imputed\n\nliability well beyond the more cabined circumstances of physical\n\ninjury and actual adverse employment actions such as failures to\n\npromote or discharge. Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White,\n\n548 U.S. 53, 67-68 (2006). In this case, there were roughly\n\nseventy-five people in the hotel’s food and beverage department\n\nalone. J.A. 135.\n\n     Having liability hinge upon utterances, of which companies\n\nhave no prior awareness and which no victim has yet reported to\n\nthem,    poses    more    than     the     threat    of    open-ended     liability.\n\nBecause liability hinges on unanticipated utterances, it will\n\ntend to drive employers as a protective measure into the role of\n\ncensors of all speech that even conceivably could give offense.\n\nFaragher    v.

Such a heavy employer hand is a high price\n\nto pay for the majority’s holding, and it is one that is not\n\ncongruent      with      Supreme         Court      rulings    or    consistent        with    our\n\nfreedoms.\n\n\n\n                                                   II.\n\n       As to the Title VII retaliation claim, an employee must\n\nshow that her belief that a hostile work environment exists or\n\nis coming into existence is objectively reasonable.

The words alleged to have\n\nbeen spoken by Clubb were abhorrent. Moreover, Clubb uttered the\n\nepithet      on   separate          occasions        and   directed        it   personally      at\n\nLiberto.       And      the    entire         course      of   conduct      surrounding        the\n\noffensive remarks was abusive. This conduct on the part of Clubb\n\nwas enough to bring Boyer-Liberto under the protection of the\n\nanti-retaliation provision of Title VII when she reported it.

An\n\nemployee must feel safe and secure in bringing an incident of\n\nthis nature to the attention of management.\n\n       Any decent management, moreover, would seemingly wish to\n\nknow of such an occurrence under its roof.

Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 764-65 (1998).\n\nEmployers are due adequate notice so that they may head off both\n\nthe    hostile     work     environment          and    any     resultant        liability.\n\nEmployees benefit when an emergent hostile work environment is\n\nnipped in the bud.\n\n       But here, too, there is a balance to be struck. The annual\n\nnumber of Title VII retaliation charges filed with the EEOC has\n\nnearly doubled since the late 1990s. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr.\n\nv.    Nassar,    133   S.    Ct.    2517,     2531       (2013).     Perhaps      American\n\nemployers      have    become      twice    as    likely       to   retaliate      against\n\nemployees since 1997, but I doubt it. One cause of the dramatic\n\nincrease    of    retaliation       claims       may    very    well    be   a    sub    voce\n\nchipping away at the objectively reasonable belief standard. See\n\nId.    at   2531-32       (suggesting        that       “lessening      the      causation\n\n                                            59\n\fstandard” for retaliation claims “could also contribute to the\n\nfiling of frivolous claims”). The majority’s approach may very\n\nwell “raise the costs, both financial and reputational, on an\n\nemployer” where there is no true objectively reasonable belief\n\nin the existence of a hostile workplace. Id. at 2532.\n\n          The dangers of allowing the objective standard to slip,\n\nhowever, go far beyond the financial and reputational costs to\n\ncompanies.           Two     severe,        if     subtle,        side    effects        warrant\n\ndiscussion: the trammeling of free speech and the construction\n\nof workplace barriers between the races and sexes.\n\n                                                   A.\n\n          If    courts      lessen         their    insistence       on     an    objectively\n\nreasonable          belief       in    a    hostile     environment        and    permit       the\n\nreporting of all manner of perceived slights to warrant Title\n\nVII protection, we become party to the creation of the workplace\n\nas    a    zone      where    First        Amendment      values     have       ceased    to    be\n\nobserved. In the context of a hostile work environment claim, it\n\nis “crucial” to use an objectively reasonable person standard\n\n“to   ensure         that    courts        and     juries    do    not    mistake       ordinary\n\nsocializing          in    the    workplace”        for     actionable      discrimination.\n\nOncale         v.   Sundowner         Offshore     Servs.,    Inc.,       523    U.S.    75,   81\n\n(1998). The same is true for retaliation claims.\n\n          People will -- and should –- discuss controversial matters\n\nat work. Some of those subjects may well pertain to race and\n\n                                                   60\n\fgender. Disagreement on these and other matters may be heated\n\nand robust, but it should not on that account be reportable.\n\nPeople    may    also     say     offensive        things        in     the     workplace.\n\nDistasteful, even offensive, speech is unfortunate but it is\n\noften a “necessary side effect[] of the broader enduring values”\n\nthat the First Amendment protects. Cohen v. California, 403 U.S.\n\n15, 25 (1971). The premise of the First Amendment is that we as\n\na people not leap quickly to suppression, see Texas v. Johnson,\n\n491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989), which may well occur if reportage and\n\npunishment for mere speech is an omnipresent possibility.\n\n       The remarks alleged here reached the point of abusiveness\n\naccompanied by threatening and intimidating body language. Clubb\n\napproached so closely that Boyer-Liberto “could feel her breath”\n\nand the shouting caused Clubb to “spit on [her] face.” J.A. 241.\n\n       Actions    are     one     thing.     The        greater       danger      lies    in\n\npredicating      liability      on   remarks.       Not    here,        because    Clubb’s\n\nlanguage, to say the very least, played “no essential part [in]\n\nany exposition of ideas.” Chaplinksy v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S.\n\n568,     572    (1942).     But      there       will     be     many     instances        of\n\nuncomfortable      workplace      speech     that       cannot    on     that     basis    be\n\ndeemed    actionably      hostile.     It    has    always     been      the    case     that\n\n“[t]o    justify     suppression        of       free     speech        there     must     be\n\nreasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free\n\nspeech is practiced.” Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 376\n\n                                            61\n\f(1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (emphasis added). A central\n\n“function of free speech under our system of government is to\n\ninvite dispute.” Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4\n\n(1949). Unless the “evil” is “imminent . . ., the remedy to be\n\napplied is more speech, not enforced silence.” Whitney, 274 U.S.\n\nat 377 (Brandeis, J., concurring). More speech means insensitive\n\nexpression in the workplace should be countered and denounced as\n\nsuch. But the bedrock meaning of the First Amendment will be\n\nlost if the expression of disfavored or objectionable positions\n\non sensitive and volatile issues become subjects of reportage\n\nand sanction. If every co-worker becomes a potential informant,\n\ndoes this environment not in time come to resemble societies\n\nother than our own?\n\n       Anti-discrimination         initiatives       need    not    be    at   war    with\n\nfree speech. The values protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nneed not be inconsistent with those safeguarded by the First.\n\nGood things happen when people, in this case company employees,\n\ntalk    things    out      among   themselves.       Collective          discourse    and\n\ndecision-making       is    a   matter   the    First       Amendment      holds     dear.\n\nAbrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J.,\n\ndissenting) (noting that “the ultimate good desired is better\n\nreached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is\n\nthe    power     of   the    thought     to    get     itself      accepted     in    the\n\ncompetition      of   the    market”).    I    agree    with    the      majority    that\n\n                                          62\n\f“early reporting [is] vital to achieving Title VII’s goal of\n\navoiding     harm.”         Maj.     Op.       at    39.       But       the     majority     nowhere\n\nacknowledges the dangers of over-reporting. It drifts ever so\n\ncasually toward draconian consequences for mere utterance and\n\nspeech. Such blindness to First Amendment values bespeaks a lack\n\nof   faith       in    lateral      discussions               which      would       no   doubt     lead\n\nnowhere in the case of Clubb and plaintiff, but which may be far\n\npreferable        to       hair-trigger             reporting            in      working     out     the\n\nmisunderstandings that occur in every workplace.\n\n      Workplaces           in    their    own       way       are    our      town     squares.     John\n\ntalking to Kathy may prove in the end more fruitful than John\n\nrunning     to    a    higher       authority            to    have      Kathy’s        point-of-view\n\ncondemned. An objective test, not a subjective standard geared\n\nto the most heightened sensibilities, best preserves the balance\n\nbetween free speech and anti-discrimination law. The fact that\n\nsome incidents, as here, are plainly beyond the pale does not\n\nmean we surrender hope in other instances of workers reaching\n\nhumane    understandings            in    discussions               with      themselves.     Turning\n\nsomeone     in    as    a       course    of    first         resort       or     on    insubstantial\n\ngrounds     may       perpetuate         resentment           and     bring       the     prospect    of\n\nemployee dialogue to a premature end.\n\n      The    law      of    hostile       environments              is     not    anchored     in    any\n\nspecific statutory provision. Rather, it was derived from Title\n\nVII’s general prohibition of discrimination, Meritor Sav. Bank,\n\n                                                    63\n\fFSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64-67 (1986), and kept in proper\n\nperspective,         it     helps         prevent       companies           from     becoming\n\nintolerable places for racial, ethnic, and other minorities to\n\nwork.      Hostile      environment       doctrine      has     also      been     judicially\n\ndeveloped almost in the manner of federal common law. It would\n\nbe wrong not to infuse this development with one of the greatest\n\nof   our    enumerated      constitutional          values,        that     of     freedom    of\n\nspeech. Especially when the speech concerns current affairs or\n\nother    public      issues,      courts    must    take      notice.       See     Snyder    v.\n\nPhelps,      131     S.     Ct.     1207,       1215-16        (2011).        The     framers\n\n“believed . . . that             public    discussion         is   a    political        duty.”\n\nWhitney,      274    U.S.    at    375     (Brandeis,      J.,      concurring).          Civic\n\nhealth requires that Americans not be fearful of their freedoms,\n\nwhether in public or private venues, and especially a freedom so\n\nprecious as the exercise of speech. The majority unfortunately\n\ntakes less than token recognition of this value. It does not\n\nherald     for   future     courts       the   dangers     of      taking     the    American\n\nworkplace down a more autocratic path.\n\n                                               B.\n\n      The     objects       of     civil       rights    laws       are      to     eliminate\n\ndiscrimination,           bring     Americans       together,          and       break     down\n\nbarriers.        This     purpose     remains        crucial,          as    Congress        has\n\nrepeatedly attested. And yet our schools are resegregating. Our\n\nneighborhoods in all too many instances are very far apart. The\n\n                                               64\n\fworkplace may be where racial interactions are most frequent,\n\nand it will be sad if law pushes this last remaining venue into\n\nthe    more     separatist        habits     that       elsewhere      too     frequently\n\nprevail.\n\n       Title VII guards against this. Title VII will be counter-\n\nproductive, however, if it countenances workplaces over-reliant\n\non employee surveillance and reportage. Such a system erects\n\nbarriers rather than dismantles them. In an ideal world, the\n\nraces and sexes would interact spontaneously, in natural and\n\ncreative ways. There would be no single correct way to behave\n\naround, no single correct thing to say to, a worker of another\n\nrace    or     gender.       We   are     people    --     human      beings     --        with\n\ncommonalities far more profound than superficial differences.\n\n       The     majority      surely     agrees.     Yet     by     focusing      on    sick\n\n“bigots”       who    “belittle     racial       minorities,”       Maj.     Op.      at    38\n\n(quoting Jordan v. Alt. Res. Corp., 458 F.3d 332, 353-54 (4th\n\nCir. 2006) (King, J., dissenting)), the majority sells the more\n\ngenerous potential of most Americans short.\n\n       Title     VII     must     not     contribute       an    added       element        of\n\ninhibition      when    we    communicate        with    those   of    another     sex      or\n\nrace. And yet I fear that is precisely what will happen if the\n\nobjectively          reasonable     standard        is    diluted       in     favor        of\n\nretaliation          protection     for     any     report,        however      marginal,\n\ntrivial, or unsubstantiated. The Supreme Court has made clear\n\n                                            65\n\fthat Title VII’s “prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex\n\nrequires      neither      asexuality           nor     androgyny    in       the    workplace.”\n\nOncale,       523     U.S.      at        81.    But     where      every          ambiguous      or\n\nunintentionally           insensitive           remark     is     going       to    be     reported\n\nupstairs, employees naturally will seek to cluster with those\n\nwho    look,      act,    and    think          “like    themselves.”          Instead       of   an\n\ninteractive         community        in    which       individual        attributes         can   be\n\nrecognized,         understood,       celebrated,          and     embraced,         the    result\n\nwill   be     a    more   fractious         and       walled-off     working         environment\n\nwhere noxious stereotypes persist. Keeping interracial distance\n\nand    maintaining        interracial            silence     will     become         the    safest\n\ncourse, the easiest way to avoid a blot on one’s record that\n\ncomes even with a co-worker’s erroneous report. This road is in\n\nno    one’s       interest,     certainly          not     ours     as    a    nation       or    as\n\nindividuals in the simple search for friends. We must not become\n\nothers to ourselves.\n\n\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       The search for balance is important in law, lest the aims\n\nof one of America’s greatest Acts be compromised by a needlessly\n\ncensored and suspicious workplace. I believe the majority is\n\nright in allowing plaintiff’s retaliation claim to proceed, but\n\nwrong in not affirming the district court on the merits of the\n\nTitle VII claim. More than that, I regret that my friends in the\n\n                                                  66\n\fmajority did not do more to recognize that this is an equation\n\nwith   two   sides,   an   area   with    more   than   one   dimension.   The\n\nharmony of balance is nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n\n                                     67\n\fNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n      The    majority         holds    that       an    employee’s      use   of   the      term\n\n“porch monkey” twice in a 24-hour period, when talking to a\n\nfellow employee about a single workplace incident, transformed\n\nthe workplace into a racially hostile environment and thereby\n\neffected a discriminatory change in the terms and conditions of\n\nthe offended employee’s employment, in violation of Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.\n\nIt holds further that the offended employee could therefore have\n\nhad a reasonable belief “that a hostile work environment [was]\n\nin   progress,”         ante,       at 44    (emphasis       added),       such    that      her\n\nopposition        to    the     incident      justified          her   retaliation          claim\n\nagainst      her        employer.            It        reaches     these      unprecedented\n\nconclusions by relying on selected and distilled snippets from\n\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998), which,\n\naccording        to    the     majority,      justify      the     conclusion      that      “an\n\n‘isolated incident’ of harassment can ‘amount to discriminatory\n\nchanges     in    the       terms    and    conditions      of    employment,’         if    that\n\nincident is ‘extremely serious,’” ante, at 26 (quoting Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 788).\n\n      Faragher, however, does not support the majority’s reading\n\nof   it,    and       the    majority’s      conclusions         are   otherwise       without\n\nprecedent.            First,    in    the    very       quotation      relied     on   by    the\n\nmajority, the Faragher Court noted that “isolated incidents” --\n\n                                               68\n\fusing the plural -- might, if “extremely serious,” satisfy the\n\nseverity requirement for racial harassment.                              524 U.S. at 788.\n\nTo rationalize its holding, the majority thus reads the plural\n\n“incidents” in Faragher to refer only to a “single incident.”\n\n       Second, and more importantly, the majority fails to note\n\nthat the portions of Faragher to which it cites were part of the\n\nSupreme Court’s much lengthier discussion -- and substantively\n\ndifferent message -- describing the type of conduct that would\n\nnot violate Title VII.             In that discussion, the Court drew on\n\nseveral   opinions    from       the     courts       of     appeals      and       noted,       for\n\ninstance,   that    the     “‘mere       utterance          of    an   ethnic        or    racial\n\nepithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee’ would\n\nnot sufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to\n\nviolate Title VII.”         Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787 (emphasis added)\n\n(quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1971)); see\n\nalso    Meritor    Sav.    Bank,       FSB     v.    Vinson,       477    U.S.       66    (1986)\n\n(same).      The    Court        also    cited        approvingly         to     a    text       on\n\ndiscrimination      law    which    observed,          in    part,       that    “a       lack   of\n\nracial    sensitivity       does        not,        alone,       amount    to        actionable\n\nharassment.”       Id.

Finally, the\n\nCourt    summarized       some    of     its      earlier        rulings       in     the    very\n\nparagraph relied on by the majority:\n\n\n\n                                             69\n\f      So, in Harris [v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17\n      (1993)], we explained that in order to be actionable\n      under   the    statute,     a    sexually   objectionable\n      environment must be both objectively and subjectively\n      offensive, one that a reasonable person would find\n      hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact\n      did perceive to be so.           We directed courts to\n      determine whether an environment is sufficiently\n      hostile   or    abusive    by    looking   at   all   the\n      circumstances,    including    the   frequency    of  the\n      discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is\n      physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere\n      offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably\n      interferes with an employee’s work performance.      Most\n      recently,   we   explained    that  Title VII   does  not\n      prohibit genuine but innocuous differences in the ways\n      men and women routinely interact with members of the\n      same sex and of the opposite sex.       A recurring point\n      in these opinions is that simple teasing, off-hand\n      comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely\n      serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in\n      the terms and conditions of employment.\n\nId. at 787-88 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      Without    the       abridged    Faragher        snippets,    which   fail   to\n\ncapture that case’s larger message, the majority is left with\n\nvirtually no support for its holdings and certainly none from\n\nthe   language        of   Title VII     or      any    Supreme    Court    decision\n\nconstruing      it.        Indeed,    the     Supreme    Court     has   steadfastly\n\nmaintained that, to be actionable under Title VII, conduct must\n\nbe so “severe or pervasive” as “to alter the conditions of [the\n\nvictim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.”\n\nMeritor, 477 U.S. at 67 (alteration in original) (quoting Henson\n\nv. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 1982)) (internal\n\n\n                                            70\n\fquotation marks omitted).             And because hostile work environment\n\nclaims by their “very nature involve[] repeated conduct,” the\n\nCourt has further recognized -- and the majority acknowledges,\n\nsee ante, at 26 -- that “a single act of harassment may not be\n\nactionable on its own.”              Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,\n\n536 U.S. 101, 115 (2002).              Instead, such claims must be “based\n\non the cumulative effect of individual acts.”                     Id.\n\n      To   be    absolutely     clear,     this    case    does      not      present      the\n\nquestion of whether an employee should be allowed to call a\n\nfellow employee a “porch monkey.”                  Such a racially derogatory\n\nand highly offensive term does not belong in the workplace, and\n\nI   condemn     it.      Nor   does   this      case    present      the      question      of\n\nwhether    an    employee,     justifiably        offended      by     being    called       a\n\n“porch monkey,” should report such an incident to management.\n\nRather, the issues here are substantially narrower.\n\n      Framed     by     principles    of   well-established            law,     the    first\n\nquestion in this case is whether a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat an employee’s use of the term “porch monkey” twice in a 24-\n\nhour period, when talking to a fellow employee about a single\n\nincident,       could    objectively       be   considered        so    severe        as   to\n\ntransform       the   workplace   into     a    racially     hostile       environment,\n\nthereby    effecting       a   discriminatory          change   in      the    terms       and\n\nconditions of her employment.              And if we were to conclude that a\n\nreasonable jury would be unable to make such a finding on the\n\n                                           71\n\fsummary judgment record in this case, then the next question\n\nwould be whether a reasonable jury could find that the offended\n\nemployee engaged in protected activity when she reported the\n\nconduct because she reasonably believed that her employer had\n\ncommitted     or       was    in    the     process      of   committing        an    employment\n\npractice that was made unlawful by Title VII.                                   See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-3(a).\n\n     I respectfully submit that the pertinent law, when applied\n\nto the facts in the record, requires a negative response to both\n\nquestions.             I    would       therefore       affirm     the    district       court’s\n\nsimilar conclusions.\n\n\n                                                   I\n\n     Reya         Boyer-Liberto,            an     African-American             woman,       began\n\nworking      at        the     Clarion        Resort      Fontainebleau              Hotel    (the\n\n“Clarion”)        in       Ocean    City,    Maryland,        on   August 4,         2010.    The\n\nClarion is a typical oceanfront hotel, with several restaurants,\n\nbars,   a    nightclub,            and    banquet      facilities,        and    it    typically\n\nemploys about 75 people in its Food and Beverage Department.\n\nLiberto      started         as     a    morning       hostess     in    the    hotel’s      main\n\nrestaurant, but she proceeded to work in many of the hotel’s\n\nother       Food       and         Beverage      positions,             including       serving,\n\nbartending, and working banquets.                        According to Leonard Berger,\n\nthe Clarion’s owner, Liberto struggled in all of the positions\n\n\n                                                 72\n\fto which she was assigned, and he terminated her employment on\n\nSeptember 21, 2010, because she “had failed at four jobs” and\n\n“[t]here [were] no more places for her.”\n\n     During her employment, Liberto interacted with Trudi Clubb,\n\na white woman, who was a longtime employee at the Clarion and a\n\nfriend    of    Berger’s.           Clubb    worked       part-time   as       an    evening\n\nrestaurant manager, and she described her responsibilities in\n\nthat role as “getting things going for the early part of the\n\nday, seeing that the crew is well-equipped and ready to present\n\nthemselves to the customers, getting the tables ready, getting\n\nthe buffet . . . ready, overseeing all the items that need to be\n\ndone,”    and   generally       helping      out     as    needed.    Clubb         directly\n\nreported to Richard Heubeck, the Clarion’s Food and Beverage\n\nDirector, as well as Mark Elman, the hotel’s General Manager.\n\nClubb did not participate in hiring decisions, and there is no\n\nindication      in    the    record     that      she     was   authorized          to   fire,\n\ndemote, or otherwise take tangible employment actions against\n\nother members of the Clarion’s staff.\n\n     In any event, whatever the exact nature of Clubb’s role at\n\nthe Clarion, Liberto testified during her deposition that she\n\nnever understood Clubb to be a supervisor or even a manager.                               To\n\nbe sure, Liberto believed that Clubb, who had worked at the\n\nClarion    for       close     to     20     years        and   had   a    longstanding\n\nrelationship         with    Berger,       had    power     that   she,    a    brand-new\n\n                                             73\n\femployee, did not have.           But Liberto stated that she reported to\n\nHeubeck and to a manager named Jamie Avery, and she was adamant\n\nthat she never thought of Clubb as her manager.                     Instead, her\n\n“understanding of . . . Clubb was that she was basically a\n\nfriend of Dr. Berger’s that was there to greet people and just\n\nto be a smiling face” -- in other words, that Clubb was merely a\n\n“glorified hostess.”         Indeed, Liberto stated that she was “told\n\nby everyone” that she should just “humor” Clubb and that Avery\n\nspecifically told her “not to go to [Clubb] because [Clubb] did\n\nnot   have   the     power   to    do   voids   or    make   decisions.”        She\n\nexplained that, although she listened to Clubb, she did so only\n\nto the extent that she had “to be respectful and listen to\n\neveryone     [she]     work[ed]      with.”          And   while    Clubb     would\n\noccasionally ask Liberto or other employees to do tasks, Liberto\n\ntestified that “it was not a regular routine . . . [for Clubb\n\nto] instruct[]” other employees and that Clubb did not correct\n\nher work.\n\n      Liberto testified that, soon after she had started working\n\nat the Clarion, she felt as though Clubb had “singled [her] out”\n\nand   had    threatened       to     take     advantage      of    her   personal\n\nrelationship with Berger to make trouble for Liberto.                       But the\n\nincident central to this action occurred more than a month after\n\nLiberto had been hired.\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\f     Late    on   the   night    of   September     14,    Liberto    was   serving\n\ndrinks when a customer ordered a “Hula Hula,” a cocktail that\n\nwas particularly time-consuming to make.                  When the bartender at\n\nthe restaurant’s primary bar refused to make the drink, Liberto\n\nwalked around to the Clarion’s “pub bar” to order the drink\n\nthere.      Once the drink was ready, Liberto passed through the\n\nkitchen on her way back to the dining room, even though that was\n\na much longer route, so as to avoid the primary bartender who\n\nrefused to make the “Hula Hula.”                 As she did so, Clubb yelled\n\nout to Liberto that she was not supposed to cut through the\n\nkitchen, but Liberto did not hear Clubb.                  Clubb then approached\n\nLiberto as she was preparing the customer’s check, yelling at\n\nLiberto for ignoring her and calling Liberto “deaf.”                        Liberto\n\nsaid that the distance between the two was close enough that she\n\ncould    “feel    [Clubb’s]     breath”    and    that    spittle    from   Clubb’s\n\nmouth was hitting her.          Liberto shook her head and said “okay,”\n\nbut largely went about her work, which made Clubb more agitated.\n\nAs the episode concluded and Clubb was walking away, Clubb said\n\nthat she was “going to make [Liberto] sorry” and called Liberto\n\neither a “damn or dang, porch monkey.”\n\n     At the beginning of her shift on September 15, Liberto went\n\nto Heubeck’s office to complain about Clubb’s conduct.                       During\n\nthe meeting, Clubb came in and said to Liberto, “I need to speak\n\nto you, little girl.”         Liberto told Clubb that she was currently\n\n                                          75\n\fspeaking with Heubeck, but Clubb responded that she was “more\n\nimportant.”      Liberto and Clubb then sat down at a table outside\n\nHeubeck’s      office,      and    Clubb     scolded      Liberto     for    “abandoning\n\n[her] station” the previous night.                      As this meeting broke up,\n\nClubb said that “she was going to go to Dr. Berger” and “teach\n\n[Liberto] a lesson.”              Using a raised voice, Clubb again called\n\nLiberto a “porch monkey.”\n\n      A   couple     of    days    later,        on   September   17,   2010,      Liberto\n\nspoke by telephone with Nancy Berghauer, the Clarion’s Human\n\nResources Director, regarding Clubb.                    Berghauer made typewritten\n\nnotes     of   the   conversation          and    forwarded    them     to   Berger       and\n\nElman.     The next day, September 18, Elman met with Liberto to\n\ndiscuss the situation and to ensure that Berghauer’s notes were\n\naccurate.      That same day, Heubeck met with Clubb to discuss the\n\nincident,      and     Clubb      denied    Liberto’s       allegations.           Heubeck\n\nnonetheless issued Clubb a written warning.\n\n      When, on September 17, Berger learned about the conflict\n\nbetween Clubb and Liberto, he asked Heubeck to update him on\n\n“exactly what was going on,” and he also asked about Liberto’s\n\njob   performance.          Heubeck        reported     that   Liberto       had   so     far\n\nperformed poorly in every job to which she had been assigned.\n\nThe next afternoon, Berger met with Elman to review Liberto’s\n\nwork file and discovered that Liberto had failed the Clarion’s\n\nbartending      test      “miserably.”           When   Berger    indicated        that   he\n\n                                             76\n\fthought the Clarion should terminate Liberto’s employment, Elman\n\nand Berghauer indicated that doing so “could create a situation”\n\nbecause of Liberto’s complaint.                  Berger replied that “there’s\n\nnot going to be any good time to let her go.                     The situation will\n\nbe there.”        After further consulting Heubeck, Berger made the\n\nfinal decision to terminate Liberto’s employment, and Liberto\n\nwas notified of the decision on September 21.                         Clubb was not\n\ninvolved in the decision, only learning of it a week later.\n\nBerger acknowledged in his deposition that Liberto’s complaint\n\nprompted him to take a look at her record, but he asserted that\n\nhis decision to fire her “had nothing to do with her complaint”\n\nand was instead based solely on her poor performance.\n\n     Liberto filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment    Opportunity         Commission      (“EEOC”)       on   September      23,\n\n2010, alleging discrimination based on her race and retaliation\n\nbased on her engagement in protected activity, in violation of\n\nTitle VII.        The EEOC issued Liberto a Notice of Right to Sue,\n\nfollowing which Liberto commenced this action.\n\n     In her complaint, Liberto asserted four claims for relief:\n\ntwo counts of racial discrimination by virtue of a hostile work\n\nenvironment, in violation of Title VII (Count I) and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981    (Count    III),   and     two   counts      of    retaliation,      also   in\n\nviolation    of     Title   VII    (Count       II)   and   §    1981     (Count   IV).\n\nLiberto     filed     her    Title        VII     claims        against     only     the\n\n                                          77\n\fFontainebleau       Corporation,         trading       as     the        Clarion      Resort\n\nFontainebleau        Hotel,       but       named     both        the      Fontainebleau\n\nCorporation and Berger as defendants in her § 1981 claims.\n\n      Following     discovery,        the    defendants          filed    a    motion       for\n\nsummary    judgment.        Taking      Liberto’s      deposition          testimony         as\n\ntrue, the district court held that the offensive conduct was too\n\nisolated    to    support      Liberto’s      claims       for    discrimination            and\n\nretaliation.       Accordingly, by order dated April 4, 2013, the\n\ncourt entered judgment in favor of the defendants.                             This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                            II\n\n      In   holding      that    the     district      court       erred       by    entering\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants on Liberto’s hostile work\n\nenvironment      claims,    the    majority      extends         Title    VII       liability\n\nbeyond the statute’s textual scope and beyond what the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized in construing the statute.\n\n      The governing principles are well established.                               Title VII\n\nmakes it “an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . .\n\nto   discriminate       against    any      individual       with       respect       to    his\n\ncompensation,      terms,      conditions,       or   privileges         of    employment,\n\nbecause    of    such   individual’s        race,     color,       religion,         sex,    or\n\nnational origin.”          42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).                    “This provision\n\nobviously   prohibits       discrimination          with    respect       to       employment\n\n\n                                            78\n\fdecisions       that    have    direct       economic             consequences,         such       as\n\ntermination,      demotion,         and    pay     cuts.”           Vance    v.    Ball       State\n\nUniv., 133 S. Ct. 2434, 2440 (2013).                          Since 1986, however, the\n\nSupreme       Court    has    recognized         that    this        provision       “not      only\n\ncovers       ‘terms’    and    ‘conditions’             in    the     narrow       contractual\n\nsense,” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75,\n\n78 (1998), but also forbids the “practice of creating a working\n\nenvironment heavily charged with . . . discrimination,” Meritor,\n\n477    U.S.    at 66    (quoting      Rogers,       454       F.2d    at    238);       see    also\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 21 (1993) (“The phrase ‘terms, conditions,\n\nor privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent to\n\nstrike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment . . . in\n\nemployment,       which      includes       requiring             people    to    work        in   a\n\ndiscriminatorily hostile or abusive environment” (citation and\n\nsome internal quotation marks omitted)).                           But in order to ensure\n\nthat    a     cause    of    action       based    on        an    alleged       hostile       work\n\nenvironment      is    justified      by     the    statute’s          text,      the    Supreme\n\nCourt has emphasized time and time again that the underlying\n\nharassment must be “so ‘severe or pervasive’ as to ‘alter the\n\nconditions of [the victim’s] employment.’”                            Faragher, 524 U.S.\n\nat     786    (alteration      in     original)          (emphasis          added)      (quoting\n\nMeritor, 477 U.S. at 67); see also, e.g., Vance, 133 S.

Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 752\n\n(1998) (recognizing that only harassing conduct that is “severe\n\nor pervasive” can effect a “constructive alteration[] in the\n\nterms or conditions of employment” and thus become “cognizable\n\nunder    Title    VII”);      Oncale,    523      U.S.    at   81       (emphasizing        that\n\nTitle    VII’s     “prohibition      of      harassment        .    .     .    forbids      only\n\nbehavior so objectively offensive as to alter the ‘conditions’\n\nof the victim’s employment”); Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 (“When the\n\nworkplace        is     permeated       with      discriminatory               intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment, Title VII is violated” (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n      This demanding standard thus requires more than “conduct\n\nthat is merely offensive.”                Harris, 510 U.S. at 21; see also\n\nOncale, 523 U.S. at 80 (noting that Title VII will not become “a\n\ngeneral civility code for the American workplace” so long as\n\ncourts    pay     “careful      attention         to     the   requirements            of   the\n\nstatute”).            Indeed,    the      Supreme         Court         has     specifically\n\nrecognized       that   the    “‘mere    utterance        of   an       ethnic    or    racial\n\nepithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee’ would\n\nnot   affect     the    conditions      of     employment          to    [a]    sufficiently\n\nsignificant degree to violate Title VII.”                               Meritor, 477 U.S.\n\n                                             80\n\fat 67 (emphasis added) (quoting Rogers, 454 F.2d at 238); see\n\nalso Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.              Similarly, the Court has stressed\n\nthat “simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents\n\n(unless      extremely     serious)     will    not     amount   to    discriminatory\n\nchanges in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’”                          Faragher,\n\n524   U.S.    at   788    (citation     and     some    internal      quotation      marks\n\nomitted).       It should thus come as no surprise that the Court has\n\ndescribed the “very nature” of a hostile work environment claim\n\nas “involv[ing] repeated conduct.”                 Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115; see\n\nalso id. (“The ‘unlawful employment practice’ [at issue in a\n\nhostile work environment claim] . . . cannot be said to occur on\n\nany particular day.          It occurs over a series of days or perhaps\n\nyears and, in direct contrast to discrete acts, a single act of\n\nharassment may not be actionable on its own.                        Such claims are\n\nbased on the cumulative effect of individual acts.” (Citation\n\nomitted)).\n\n      Finally,      the    Court    has    emphasized        that     the     impact   of\n\noffensive workplace conduct on an employee’s work environment\n\ncannot be “measured in isolation.”                     Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nBreeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270 (2001) (per curiam).                       Instead, courts\n\nmust determine “whether an environment is sufficiently hostile\n\nor    abusive      [to    support   a     claim]       by   ‘looking     at    all     the\n\ncircumstances,’ including the ‘frequency of the discriminatory\n\nconduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or\n\n                                           81\n\fhumiliating,    or    a   mere    offensive    utterance;     and       whether    it\n\nunreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.’”\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 787-88 (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23).\n\n      Under these controlling principles, Clubb’s alleged use of\n\nthe term “porch monkey” twice in less than 24 hours when talking\n\nabout a single incident was, as a matter of law, not so severe\n\nor pervasive as to produce a racially hostile work environment\n\nthat changed the terms and conditions of Liberto’s employment.\n\n      There is no suggestion by the majority that the alleged\n\nharassment was sufficiently pervasive to qualify -- nor could\n\nthere be.      As such, this case falls outside the heartland of\n\nhostile work environment claims, the “very nature [of which]\n\ninvolves repeated conduct.”           Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115.            Instead,\n\nthe   only   question     at   this   juncture      is   whether    a    jury    that\n\nbelieved Liberto’s description of events could find that Clubb’s\n\nconduct was so severe that it altered the terms and conditions\n\nof Liberto’s employment by creating a work atmosphere that was\n\nobjectively racially hostile.          The answer is plainly no.                To be\n\nsure, the term “porch monkey” is an odious racial epithet, and\n\nany reasonable person in Liberto’s position would of course be\n\noffended by its use.           But the “‘mere utterance of an ethnic or\n\nracial epithet,’” which offends an employee, does not “affect\n\nthe   conditions     of   employment    to    [a]   sufficiently        significant\n\ndegree to violate Title VII.”           Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67 (quoting\n\n                                       82\n\fRogers, 454 F.2d at 238); see also Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.                              In\n\nshort,       Liberto   has     not   presented        evidence      from       which    a\n\nreasonable jury could find that her workplace was “permeated\n\nwith   ‘discriminatory        intimidation,       ridicule,      and   insult’       that\n\n[was] ‘sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions\n\nof [her] employment and create an abusive working environment.’”\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 21 (citation omitted) (quoting Meritor, 477\n\nU.S. at 65, 67).\n\n       The     majority’s     conclusion    to    the    contrary      rests    on     two\n\ndistortions, one factual and one legal.                       First, the majority\n\nbrazenly distorts the facts contained in the summary judgment\n\nrecord regarding Liberto’s understanding of Clubb’s role at the\n\nClarion.       The majority begins by stating that the current record\n\ndoes     not    establish      “whether     Clubb       was   actually      Liberto’s\n\nsupervisor      or   simply    her   co-worker.”         Ante,    at   30   (emphasis\n\nadded).      But nonetheless it then proceeds to “deem Clubb to have\n\nbeen   Liberto’s       supervisor”    for       the   purpose    of    “gauging        the\n\nseverity of Clubb’s conduct,” ante, at 32, on the theory that\n\nClubb portrayed herself as having the ability to get Liberto\n\nfired by taking advantage of her friendship with Berger.                             From\n\nthis, the majority goes yet further and presumes that Liberto\n\nmust have believed that Clubb was effectively her supervisor,\n\nthus lending a “particularly threatening character” to Clubb’s\n\n\n\n                                           83\n\fconduct.         Ante,     at    32    (quoting      Ellerth,       524    U.S.        at     763)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      There        are,   however,      two    significant          problems       with       the\n\nmajority’s approach.              First, it is highly doubtful that Clubb,\n\nwho   may     have     wielded     influence       on    the     Clarion’s       owner      as    a\n\nresult      of     a    personal      relationship         but     who     lacked        direct\n\nauthority        to    take     tangible      employment         actions     or        even      to\n\nrecommend formally that such actions be taken, would qualify as\n\nLiberto’s        supervisor.          Indeed,       the     Supreme       Court        recently\n\nclarified what makes an employee a “supervisor” in the context\n\nof hostile work environment claims, holding that the critical\n\nconsideration is whether “he or she is empowered by the employer\n\nto take tangible employment actions against the victim.”                                 Vance,\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2439 (emphasis added).                       In so holding, the Court\n\nexplained        that     this     definition           would     typically       allow          an\n\nemployee’s         supervisory        status       to     be     “readily        determined,\n\ngenerally by written documentation.”                      Id. at 2443; see also id.\n\nat 2449 (“The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that\n\nwe adopt today is one that can be readily applied”).                               The Court\n\nindicated that employees can still qualify as supervisors even\n\nif    their      “decisions       [are]    subject         to     approval        by     higher\n\nmanagement.”           Id. at 2446 n.8.            It similarly noted that if the\n\nindividuals        vested     with    decisionmaking            power    “have    a     limited\n\nability       to       exercise       independent         discretion         when        making\n\n                                              84\n\fdecisions” and must instead “rely on [the recommendations of]\n\nother workers who actually interact with the affected employee”\n\nthen “the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the\n\npower to take tangible employment actions to the employees on\n\nwhose     recommendations            [the     individual          formally       vested     with\n\ndecisionmaking authority] relies.”                         Id. at 2452.           But both of\n\nthose    situations      are    a     far     cry    from       an    employee     whose    only\n\ninfluence      comes     from    having       the     ear       of   the    company’s      owner\n\nbecause of their personal friendship.\n\n     Moreover,        even     setting       that     issue       aside,     the   majority’s\n\nassumption       that    Liberto        must        have    perceived        Clubb    as    her\n\nsupervisor       flies    in     the        face     of     Liberto’s       own    deposition\n\ntestimony       about    her    understanding              of     Clubb’s    place    in    the\n\nClarion’s      hierarchy.            When    asked        about      her   understanding      of\n\nClubb’s role, Liberto responded, “My understanding of Trud[i]\n\nClubb was that she was basically a friend of Dr. Berger’s that\n\nwas there to greet people and just to be a smiling face.”                                    She\n\nadded,    “I    was     told    by    everyone,           oh,   just,      you    know,    humor\n\n[Clubb]. . . . [T]hat’s pretty much what everyone would say\n\nabout her.”           When pressed, she was adamant that she did not\n\nunderstand Clubb to be a manager:\n\n     Q.   Isn’t it true that you were told that [Clubb] was\n     the restaurant manager?\n\n     A.        Never.\n\n\n                                               85\n\f      Q.   Is it your -- is it your testimony that you did\n      not know Trud[i] Clubb was the restaurant manager?\n\n      A.      Absolutely that is my testimony.\n\n      Q.   You never knew throughout your entire employment\n      with the Clarion that she was a manager?\n\n      A.   Never.   I reported to Jamie [Avery], and Jamie,\n      as a matter of fact, told me not to go to [Clubb]\n      because [Clubb] did not have the power to do voids or\n      make decisions.   I had to report to Jamie or Richard\n      [Heubeck].   And at the time [Clubb] did not hold any\n      management cards or keys as Jamie did.\n\n(Emphasis added).       And when asked whether she “thought [she] had\n\nto   listen    to   [Clubb],”   Liberto’s   response   was   just   that   she\n\n“ha[d] to be respectful and listen to everyone [she] work[ed]\n\nwith.” ∗\n\n      The majority’s conclusion that we should “deem Clubb to\n\nhave been Liberto’s supervisor” for the purpose of “gauging the\n\nseverity of Clubb’s conduct” simply cannot be reconciled with\n\nthis testimony.        To the contrary, Liberto’s understanding of\n\n      ∗\n        In support of its dubious contention that Liberto\nperceived Clubb to be in a position to have her employment\nterminated, the majority points to a September 18, 2010 email\nfrom Elman to Heubeck and Berghauer in which Elman recounted his\nmeeting earlier that day with Liberto. See ante, at 10. Elman\nwrote that he had informed Liberto that Clubb was her “boss.”\nBut as the majority itself acknowledges, at this stage of the\ncase, we must accept the version of events Liberto recited in\nher deposition testimony.   See ante, at 4 n.1.    And Liberto’s\ntestimony contradicts Elman’s apparent understanding of Clubb’s\nrelationship to Liberto.    Moreover, in light of the adamancy\nwith which Liberto testified that she “never” understood Clubb\nto be a manager, we should not use Elman’s email to refute\nLiberto’s clearly stated understanding.\n\n\n\n                                     86\n\fClubb   as    a   “glorified          hostess”        who     everyone        “humor[ed]”\n\nsubstantially     lessens           the     impact      that        Clubb’s       isolated\n\nstatements could have had on Liberto’s work environment.                                 See\n\nante, at 27 (“[A] supervisor’s use of [a racial epithet] impacts\n\nthe work environment far more severely than use by co-equals”\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Rodgers v. Wis. Life\n\nIns. Co., 12 F.3d 668, 675 (7th Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      In addition to relying on a blatant mischaracterization of\n\nLiberto’s    understanding       of       Clubb’s     role    at    the   Clarion,       the\n\nmajority’s    conclusion       that       Liberto’s    hostile       work     environment\n\nclaims should reach a jury also rests on a faulty interpretation\n\nof a handful of words from the Supreme Court.                       Specifically, the\n\nmajority     places   a   great        deal      of   emphasis       on     the     Court’s\n\nobservation in Faragher that “simple teasing, offhand comments,\n\nand   isolated    incidents         (unless      extremely         serious)       will   not\n\namount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of\n\nemployment.’” 524 U.S. at 788 (emphasis added) (citation and\n\nsome internal quotation marks omitted).                      Indeed, the majority’s\n\nholding,     distilled    to     its       essence,     rests       entirely       on    its\n\nconclusion    that    this     is     “the    type     of    case     contemplated       in\n\nFaragher where the harassment, though perhaps ‘isolated,’ can\n\nproperly be deemed to be ‘extremely serious.’”                       Ante, at 34.\n\n\n\n                                            87\n\f      But in Faragher, the Supreme Court referred to “incidents,”\n\n524 U.S. at 788, not to a single incident.                                 And five years\n\nlater, the Court in Morgan confirmed that “repeated conduct” is\n\nthe   stuff    of     a    hostile     work       environment.            536    U.S.    at   115\n\n(emphasis added).             Moreover, while the Faragher Court did not\n\nelaborate on what it envisioned as the kind of extremely serious\n\nisolated incidents that may produce a hostile work environment,\n\nwe know from Meritor and Harris that such incidents cannot be\n\nthe “mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet.”                                    Meritor,\n\n477   U.S.    at 67        (quoting    Rogers,          454   F.2d    at    238)       (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).                As the Court has made clear, the\n\nmaking of such a statement in the workplace, although highly\n\noffensive,      “does       not     sufficiently          affect     the        conditions    of\n\nemployment to implicate Title VII.”                      Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.              It\n\nis true that Clubb’s alleged conduct was reprehensible.                                  But it\n\ninvolved no physical assault or threat of physical harm.                                  Cf. 3\n\nLex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination § 46.05[3][b], at 46-82\n\n(2d   ed.     2012)       (noting     that    “a     single     incident          of    physical\n\nassault       against         a      co-worker           that        is     motivated         by\n\n[discriminatory]            animus     can        qualify      as    severe        enough     to\n\nconstitute      an        alteration    of        the    co-worker’s            conditions     of\n\nemployment”).         Moreover, even though the first encounter took\n\nplace in a crowded dining room, it appears that no one heard\n\nClubb     direct      the     epithet        at    Liberto      on        either       occasion,\n\n                                              88\n\findicating that the name-calling was not publicly humiliating.\n\nAnd again, Liberto thought that she was being upbraided by a co-\n\nworker,       not         her    supervisor.              Taken        together,        these\n\nconsiderations show that, as a matter of law, Clubb’s alleged\n\nconduct     did     not    amount     to    the    “extremely      serious”        “isolated\n\nincidents” that the Faragher Court envisioned as being capable\n\nof    effecting       a    “discriminatory         change[]       in    the    ‘terms      and\n\nconditions of [the plaintiff’s] employment.’”                      524 U.S. at 788.\n\n       The majority acknowledges that this case marks the first\n\ntime that our court has concluded that a reasonable jury could\n\nfind the presence of a hostile work environment based on what\n\nwas,   at     most,       two   repeated     statements     relating          to   a   single\n\nincident.         See      ante,    at     34.     What    the     majority        does    not\n\nacknowledge, however, is that today’s decision makes our court\n\nan outlier among the other courts of appeals.                            And instead of\n\nbeing straightforward about that fact, the majority attempts to\n\nbolster its conclusion with citations to the Eleventh Circuit’s\n\ndecision in Adams v. Austal, U.S.A., L.L.C., 754 F.3d 1240 (11th\n\nCir. 2014), and the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Ayissi-Etoh v.\n\nFannie Mae, 712 F.3d 572 (D.C. Cir. 2013).                        See ante, at 33-34.\n\nBut    both    cases       involved      conduct    more    pervasive         and/or      more\n\nsevere than that alleged by Liberto here.\n\n       In Adams, one of the plaintiffs alleged that his supervisor\n\ncarved the slur “porch monkeys” into the aluminum of the ship on\n\n                                             89\n\fwhich they were working, and the Eleventh Circuit observed that\n\nthat “isolated act” was “severe.”                      754 F.3d at 1254.             But the\n\nsame plaintiff also alleged that he “saw one coworker wear a\n\nshirt with a Confederate flag”; that he “regularly saw racist\n\ngraffiti in the men’s restroom”; and that when he reported the\n\nracist graffiti, his supervisor responded by saying that “it’s\n\nalways been like that and if [he] didn’t like it [he could]\n\nquit.”         Id.   at       1253    (alterations          in     original)      (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).              It was based on the totality of these\n\nallegations       that     the       Eleventh      Circuit        concluded      that     “the\n\nharassment [the plaintiff] experienced was frequent and severe,”\n\nsuch    that     “[a]    reasonable         jury    could     find    that       [his]   work\n\nenvironment was objectively hostile.”                       Id. at 1253-54 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       Similarly,       the    harassment         in    Ayissi-Etoh        was    both    more\n\npervasive and more severe than the harassment at issue here.                               In\n\nthat case, the plaintiff -- an African-American senior financial\n\nmodeler -- asked his company’s Chief Audit Executive why he had\n\nnot received a raise in conjunction with a recent promotion.\n\n712 F.3d at 574-75.            In response, the Executive told him, “For a\n\nyoung    black    man     smart      like    you,      we   are    happy    to    have    your\n\nexpertise; I think I’m already paying you a lot of money.”                                Id.\n\nat   575   (internal       quotation        marks       omitted).          Several      months\n\nlater, the plaintiff was discussing his work responsibilities\n\n                                             90\n\fwith the company’s Vice President of Internal Audit when the\n\nmeeting “became heated” and the Vice President yelled at him,\n\n“Get out of my office nigger.”                   Id.        Although the plaintiff\n\nmissed work and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, he was\n\nforced to continue working with the Vice President during the\n\nensuing three-month investigation.                   Id.    Based on this evidence,\n\nthe D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiff was entitled to a jury\n\ntrial    on     his    hostile        work      environment          claim.                These\n\ncircumstances     in     Ayissi-Etoh      are    readily         distinguishable            from\n\nthose presented here.          First, as the court in Ayissi-Etoh noted,\n\nthe hostile work environment was precipitated not by a single\n\nevent,   but    rather    by   two    independent          statements          made    by    two\n\ndifferent      high-ranking       company            officials       who        were        both\n\nindisputably     supervisors         of   the    plaintiff.              Id.    at    577-78.\n\nThose statements ultimately led to psychological problems and\n\ndirectly      caused   the     plaintiff        to    miss       work.         Id.    at 577.\n\nSecond, the racist comments were made during conversations about\n\nthe plaintiff’s pay and work assignments, thus increasing the\n\nstatements’ ability to “alter the conditions of the victim’s\n\nemployment.”      Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.                  By contrast, in the case\n\nat hand, (1) there was only one incident involving one alleged\n\nharasser;      (2) the     alleged        harasser         was     perceived          by    the\n\nplaintiff to be a “glorified hostess” with no “power to . . .\n\nmake decisions”; and (3) although the alleged harasser denied\n\n                                           91\n\fmaking the offensive statement, the employer promptly issued her\n\na   written     reprimand,        warning      her    “to     be   cautious   [that]     the\n\nlanguage or phrases [that] she uses can not [sic] be perceived\n\nas racist or derogatory.”\n\n        For   the   reasons       given,    Clubb’s         alleged   use   of    the   term\n\n“porch monkey” twice in less than 24 hours when talking about a\n\nsingle incident was not, as a matter of law, sufficiently severe\n\nor pervasive to create a racially hostile work environment that\n\naltered the terms and conditions of Liberto’s employment.                                  I\n\nwould therefore affirm the district court’s summary judgment on\n\nLiberto’s Title VII hostile work environment claim.\n\n      For     the   same    reasons,       I    would       also   affirm   the   district\n\ncourt’s summary judgment on Liberto’s hostile work environment\n\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.                        See Spriggs v. Diamond Auto\n\nGlass,    242    F.3d      179,    184   (4th        Cir.    2001)    (recognizing      that\n\nhostile work environment claims under Title VII and § 1981 are\n\ngoverned by the same principles).\n\n\n\n                                               III\n\n      If, as the majority holds, Clubb’s twice calling Liberto a\n\n“porch monkey” in connection with a single workplace incident\n\nwas a practice made unlawful by Title VII, it would necessarily\n\nfollow that Liberto also stated a retaliation claim, for such a\n\nclaim    arises     when     an    employee         opposes    any    practice    made    an\n\n                                               92\n\funlawful practice by Title VII and therefore is subjected to an\n\nadverse employment action.                 See ante, at 36.      The majority could\n\nhave ended its retaliation claim analysis without saying more.\n\nBut it did not.        Instead, it gratuitously proceeded to adopt an\n\nunprecedented       standard         for    retaliation       claims    that     is    much\n\nbroader than necessary to resolve Liberto’s claim.                        In doing so,\n\nit also unnecessarily overruled part of our decision in Jordan\n\nv. Alternative Resources Corp., 458 F.3d 332 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                              A\n\n       As to its new, broad standard for retaliation claims, the\n\nmajority moves far beyond the scope of any statutory language or\n\nany    Supreme    Court        precedent     to    conclude    that,    even     when   an\n\nemployee     opposes       a     single      offensive    incident,       she    has    “a\n\nreasonable belief that a hostile work environment is occurring”\n\nwhenever the incident is humiliating.                       Ante, at 43; see also\n\nante, at 44-45.        Applying that standard, the majority concludes\n\nthat because “‘porch monkey’ is a racial epithet that is not\n\njust    humiliating,           but    ‘degrading      and      humiliating       in     the\n\nextreme,’”       Liberto       was    necessarily      opposing     a    hostile       work\n\nenvironment that was “in progress” when she brought the racial\n\nslurs to management’s attention.                   Ante, at 45 (quoting Spriggs,\n\n242 F.3d at 185).              Undoubtedly, this gratuitous and untenable\n\nholding    will     generate         widespread      litigation        over     the    many\n\n\n                                              93\n\foffensive workplace comments made everyday that employees find\n\nto be humiliating.\n\n       Turning        to     the     statute,        as        we    must,     Title VII’s\n\nantiretaliation provision makes it unlawful “for an employer to\n\ndiscriminate      against      any    of     his    employees . . .          because       [the\n\nemployee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\n\npractice by [Title VII].”                  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).                 Read most\n\nnaturally, this provision provides protection from retaliation\n\nto an employee who has opposed an employment practice that is\n\nactually       unlawful      under    Title VII,          including      her       employer’s\n\nmaintenance of a racially hostile work environment.                            And reading\n\n§ 2000e-3(a)’s         language       generously          to    give     effect      to    its\n\npurpose, we have held that an employee also engages in protected\n\nactivity       when    she    opposes       an     employment        practice       that   she\n\nreasonably believes to be unlawful, see EEOC v. Navy Fed. Credit\n\nUnion,    424    F.3d      397,    406-07        (4th   Cir.        2005),   although      the\n\nSupreme       Court   has    not     yet    gone     so    far.        Specifically,        in\n\nBreeden, 532 U.S. at 270, the Court declined “to rule on the\n\npropriety of [the Ninth Circuit’s] interpretation” of § 2000e-\n\n3(a)     as    “protect[ing]         employee       ‘oppos[ition]’           not    just     to\n\npractices that are actually ‘made . . . unlawful’ by Title VII,\n\nbut also to practices that the employee could reasonably believe\n\nwere unlawful,” “because even assuming [that its interpretation]\n\nis correct, no one could reasonably believe that the incident\n\n                                             94\n\f[at issue] violated Title VII.”                   Finally, we have gone one step\n\nfurther,      recognizing          that     an    employee      is     protected         from\n\nretaliation      if,    at    the    time    of    her   complaint,       she      had    “an\n\nobjectively reasonable belief in light of all the circumstances\n\nthat a Title VII violation has happened or is in progress.”\n\nJordan, 458 F.3d at 341 (emphasis added).\n\n      Under     the    Jordan      standard,      when   an    employee’s       complaint\n\nrelates    to    another      employee’s         harassing     conduct,       we   do    not\n\nrequire    the    harassment         to   have     already     risen    to    the    level\n\nactionable under Title VII in order for her opposition activity\n\nto   be   protected         from    retaliation.         But    when    the     offending\n\nconduct has not risen to the level of a practice made unlawful\n\nby Title VII, we also recognized that it would be inappropriate\n\nto   “simply     assume,       without      more,    that      the   opposed       conduct\n\n[would] continue or [would] be repeated unabated.”                           Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d at 341.          Instead, we held that in this incipient stage, a\n\nplaintiff must be able to point to evidence that “reasonably\n\nsupports the inference” that the conduct being objected to was\n\n“likely to recur at a level sufficient to create a hostile work\n\nenvironment.”         Id.     In other words, for an employee’s report of\n\nobjectionable conduct that has not yet become unlawful under\n\nTitle VII to qualify as protected activity, the employee must,\n\nat the very least, have an objectively reasonable belief that a\n\n\n\n                                             95\n\fhostile work environment would result, “based on circumstances\n\nthat the employee observes and reasonably believes.”                        Id.\n\n       Here, the majority adopts a standard far beyond that which\n\nwe recognized in Jordan and far beyond what any court of appeals\n\nhas recognized.             It holds that an employee’s single complaint\n\nabout a single incident, regardless of whether the incident is\n\nactually         unlawful    under    Title     VII    or   whether        the    employee\n\nreasonably believes that the incident is likely to recur, can be\n\nthe basis for a legitimate retaliation claim, so long as the\n\nconduct is humiliating.              See ante, at 43-45.            This new standard\n\nwill surely generate many new questions about which offensive\n\nworkplace comments are objectively humiliating and lead to an\n\nexpansion of litigation far beyond Title VII’s design.\n\n       I    would    conclude    in     this    case   that    the    district       court\n\ncorrectly         entered     summary    judgment       for    the     defendants      on\n\nLiberto’s retaliation claim because, as a matter of law, she did\n\nnot oppose activity that Title VII protects from retaliation\n\nwhen       she    reported    Clubb’s     conduct      to     the    Clarion’s      Human\n\nResources Director.            In light of all the circumstances, Clubb’s\n\nuse of an offensive racial epithet twice in less than 24 hours\n\nwas    insufficiently          severe    to     give    Liberto       an    objectively\n\nreasonable belief that she was complaining about the presence of\n\na racially hostile work environment, rather than simply about\n\nanother      employee’s      inappropriate       conduct.       Certainly,         Liberto\n\n                                           96\n\fcould have reasonably concluded from Clubb’s demeaning statement\n\nthat Clubb herself was a racist.                       But the fact that a single\n\nemployee has revealed herself through an isolated incident to be\n\nbigoted does not translate into an objectively reasonable belief\n\nthat    the    workplace         itself       has    become      abusive   to    employees\n\nbecause of their race.              Cf. Butler v. Ala. Dep’t of Transp., 536\n\nF.3d   1209,       1214    (11th       Cir.    2008)    (“[N]ot        every    act   by    an\n\nemployee in opposition to racial discrimination is protected.\n\nThe    opposition         must    be    directed       at   an    unlawful      employment\n\npractice      of   an     employer,      not    an    act   of    discrimination       by    a\n\nprivate individual” (emphasis added) (quoting Little v. United\n\nTechs., Carrier Transicold Div., 103 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir.\n\n1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Moreover, Clubb’s statements were, as a matter of law, too\n\nisolated to give Liberto an objectively reasonable belief that\n\nthe offensive conduct was likely to ripen into a hostile work\n\nenvironment.         Liberto has not identified any evidence in the\n\nrecord   suggesting         that       workplace      racism      was   afoot    prior      to\n\nClubb’s statements, nor any evidence suggesting that she had\n\nreason   to    believe       that      her    supervisors        and    co-workers    would\n\ntolerate such conduct or permit it to recur.                               Indeed, after\n\nLiberto reported the incident, the Clarion’s management promptly\n\nissued a written reprimand to Clubb, warning her to be cautious\n\nabout her language.\n\n                                               97\n\f         While Liberto had every right to be offended by Clubb’s use\n\nof   a    racial   epithet    and    acted    reasonably   and    responsibly   in\n\nreporting the incident to Clarion’s Human Resources Director,\n\nshe lacked a reasonable belief, as required by the language of\n\nTitle VII, that she was opposing her employer’s commission of\n\n“a[]       practice    made . . . unlawful . . . by              [Title    VII].”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).          For that reason, I would conclude, as a\n\nmatter of law, that she did not engage in protected activity and\n\nthat     the   district      court   therefore     properly      entered   summary\n\njudgment against her on her retaliation claims.\n\n\n                                         B\n\n         In addition to adopting a broad and unprecedented standard\n\nfor evaluating retaliation claims under Title VII, the majority\n\nalso gratuitously reverses a portion of Jordan in a manner by\n\nwhich Judge King, the majority’s author, explicitly vindicates\n\nhis dissent in Jordan, notwithstanding his concession that this\n\ncase presents distinguishing circumstances.\n\n         Notably, the majority does not overturn all of Jordan.                 It\n\nin no way suggests, for example, that the isolated incident at\n\nissue in that case was sufficiently severe to create a hostile\n\nwork environment.         Indeed, by “oberserv[ing] that the district\n\ncourt improperly analogized this matter . . . to Jordan,” the\n\nmajority instead confirms that “a racist remark that was made by\n\n\n                                         98\n\fa mere co-worker and not aimed at [the plaintiff] or any other\n\nemployee” does not amount to a hostile work environment.                           Ante,\n\nat 35.       Nor does the majority indicate that the plaintiff in\n\nJordan had a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment\n\nwas taking shape at the time he reported his co-worker’s racist\n\ncomment to his supervisors.           Rather, the only portion of Jordan\n\nthat the majority overrules is its already liberalizing rule\n\nthat    a    plaintiff    whose    retaliation        claim     is       based    on   an\n\nobjectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment\n\nwas in progress, but not yet in existence, need only point to\n\nsome evidence indicating that such an environment was “likely to\n\noccur.”      Jordan, 458 F.3d at 340;          see ante, at 38.\n\n       The    majority    claims     that      this   aspect        of    Jordan       “is\n\nincompatible      with    Crawford       [v.    Metropolitan         Government        of\n\nNashville & Davidson County, 555 U.S. 271, 279 (2009)], as well\n\nas   other    Supreme    Court    decisions     directing      that       Title    VII’s\n\nantiretaliation      provision      be    interpreted         ‘to    provide       broad\n\nprotection from retaliation.’”              Ante, at 41 (quoting Burlington\n\nN. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006)).                               An\n\nanalysis of these cases, however, belies the notion that they\n\nare in tension with Jordan or that, with these decisions, the\n\nSupreme Court has given us license to provide employees with\n\n“broad[er] protection from retaliation” than the text of the\n\nstatute justifies.\n\n                                         99\n\f       For    example,       Crawford         resolved        the     narrow     question        of\n\nwhether “an employee who speaks out about discrimination not on\n\nher    own    initiative,          but    in        answering       questions         during    an\n\nemployer’s       internal         investigation”         has        opposed      an     unlawful\n\nemployment      practice      within          the    meaning     of    Title     VII’s        anti-\n\nretaliation provision.              555 U.S. at 273.                In holding that such\n\nan    employee       had    engaged      in     protected       activity,        the        Supreme\n\nCourt’s analysis focused on the “ordinary meaning” of the term\n\n“oppose,”      leading      the     Court      to     conclude        --   as    a    matter     of\n\nstatutory interpretation -- that “[t]here is . . . no reason to\n\ndoubt that a person can ‘oppose’ by responding to someone else’s\n\nquestion      just    as    surely       as    by    provoking       the    discussion,         and\n\nnothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an\n\nemployee who reports discrimination on her own initiative but\n\nnot one who reports the same discrimination in the same words\n\nwhen her boss asks a question.”                     Id. at 276-78.          Cleary, nothing\n\nin this holding is “incompatible” with Jordan.                             Ante, at 41.\n\n       Similarly,      the    issue       in    Burlington          Northern     was        whether\n\n“Title       VII’s    antiretaliation               provision       forbids          only    those\n\nemployer      actions       and     resulting         harms     that       are       related    to\n\nemployment or the workplace,” as does the statute’s substantive\n\nantidiscrimination provision.                       548 U.S. at 61.              In answering\n\nthat     question      in    the     negative,          the     Court      emphasized          that\n\nlanguage       in     the     antidiscrimination                provision            “explicitly\n\n                                               100\n\flimit[s]    the      scope    of     that    provision    to    actions      that   affect\n\nemployment or alter the conditions of the workplace,” whereas\n\n“[n]o    such        limiting        words    appear     in    the     antiretaliation\n\nprovision.”          Id. at 62.         The Court further reasoned that the\n\ndifference between the two provisions’ purposes confirms “that\n\nCongress intended the differences that its language suggests.”\n\nId. at 63.        It was on this basis that the Court rejected the\n\nview    that    it    would     be    “‘anomalous’       to    read    the    statute   to\n\nprovide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for\n\nthose whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect, namely, victims\n\nof   race-based,        ethnic-based,         religion-based,         or     gender-based\n\ndiscrimination.”         Id. at 66.            As such, despite the majority’s\n\nsuggestion to the contrary, Burlington Northern does not stand\n\nfor the proposition that courts must always adopt the broadest\n\npossible construction of Title VII’s antiretaliation provision,\n\nand it certainly does not authorize courts to afford plaintiffs\n\nprotection beyond what the statute itself provides.\n\n       At a more general level, the majority faults the Jordan\n\nstandard as being at odds with “the hope and expectation that\n\nemployees will report harassment early, before it rises to the\n\nlevel of a hostile work environment.”                    Ante, at 38.        Along these\n\nlines, the majority suggests that, when combined with the early\n\nreporting      “compelled       by    the    Ellerth/Faragher         defense,”     Jordan\n\nplaces an employee who has experienced an isolated incident of\n\n                                             101\n\fharassment in an untenable position, leaving her vulnerable to\n\nretaliation          if    she     reports          her   supervisor’s        conduct     and\n\ninsulating her employer from liability should she fail to report\n\nit.    Ante, at 39.             The majority’s dilemma, however, is a false\n\none.      First,          the    Ellerth/Faragher         affirmative         defense    only\n\nenables    an    employer          to     avoid       vicarious    liability       for    its\n\nsupervisor’s         creation      of     a    hostile     work    environment      if    the\n\nemployer can prove both that it “exercised reasonable care to\n\nprevent and correct promptly any . . . harassing behavior, and\n\n. . . that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take\n\nadvantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided\n\nby the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.”                            Ellerth, 524 U.S.\n\nat 765 (emphasis added); see also Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807.                              It\n\nis highly doubtful, however, that an employer would be able to\n\nshow   that     an    employee      acted       unreasonably       by   choosing    not    to\n\nimmediately report an isolated incident of workplace misconduct\n\nthat was not in itself sufficient to give rise to a reasonable\n\nbelief that a hostile work environment was in progress.                                   Cf.\n\nMatvia v. Bald Head Island Mgmt., Inc., 259 F.3d 261, 270 (4th\n\nCir.   2001)     (holding          that       the    employer     had    established      the\n\naffirmative defense because, “[i]n light of th[e] long-term and\n\npersistent harassment, [the plaintiff] cannot be excused from\n\nfailing to report [her supervisor’s conduct]” sooner (emphasis\n\nadded)).         Second,          the     majority        combines      the    qualitative\n\n                                                102\n\frequirement of objective reasonableness in reporting harassment\n\nwith    the    laches    concept        described    by    the    Supreme      Court    in\n\nFaragher,      524    U.S.   at    807,    and     developed      by    this   court    in\n\nMatvia, 259 F.3d at 270, in order to invent a fictitious Catch-\n\n22.      In     actuality,    an    employee        only    risks       retaliation     by\n\nreporting too early when there is insufficient conduct about\n\nwhich to complain under Title VII, and she only risks dismissal\n\nof her claim for reporting too late when she inordinately delays\n\ncoming forward.\n\n       More to the point, however, it is not the role of this\n\ncourt     to    incentivize       the     early     reporting      of     objectionable\n\nconduct       where   Congress     itself     has    not    seen       fit   to   do   so.\n\nIndeed, Congress could have written Title VII’s antiretaliation\n\nprovision to provide protection to every employee who reports\n\nany offensive, racially or sexually charged workplace incident\n\nthat makes him or her uncomfortable.                       But it did not.             See,\n\ne.g., Breeden, 532 U.S. at 269-71 (holding that an employee did\n\nnot    engage    in    protected        activity    when    she     complained     that,\n\nduring a meeting, her supervisor read aloud a sexually explicit\n\nstatement, which a job applicant had purportedly made, before\n\nlooking at her and stating, “I don’t know what that means,” and\n\nthen chuckling along with a male employee who offered to explain\n\nthe comment to him later).                Instead, Congress chose to protect\n\nonly employees who have “opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\n                                           103\n\femployment practice by [Title VII].”                       42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\nWe have already liberally interpreted this provision to protect\n\nemployees who possess an objectively reasonable belief that they\n\nare complaining about a Title VII violation that has occurred or\n\nis in progress, a standard that serves to protect employees in\n\nclose   cases.         But    we    cannot        simply   presume       that    a    single\n\nincident     of    racially          charged           workplace     misconduct        will\n\ninevitably      ripen        into     an     actual        racially       hostile       work\n\nenvironment,       lest       our         interpretation           become       completely\n\nuntethered from Title VII’s text.                       Instead, a plaintiff whose\n\nretaliation claim is based on an objectively reasonable belief\n\nthat she was opposing a hostile work environment that was in the\n\nprocess of developing must be able to point to some evidence\n\nthat supports the inference that such an environment was “likely\n\nto occur.”      Jordan, 458 F.3d at 340 (emphasis added).\n\n      Instead     of     requiring          the     plaintiff       to    produce       such\n\nevidence, the majority concludes that opposing an incident that\n\nis humiliating, regardless of whether it could lead to a hostile\n\nwork environment, is protected.                   Ante, at 44-45.        Even a cursory\n\nconsideration      of    this       new    per     se    rule   quickly     reveals     its\n\nproblems.    An isolated incident of humiliating harassment is, of\n\ncourse, more serious than “a mere offensive utterance.”                              Harris,\n\n510 U.S. at 23.         But it is far from clear why a single incident\n\nof   humiliating       harassment         that    is    insufficient      to    support   a\n\n                                            104\n\freasonable belief that a hostile work environment had come into\n\nexistence would nonetheless give rise to a reasonable belief\n\nthat    a   hostile       work       environment        was    in   the       process       of\n\ndeveloping.         The majority must be assuming that, if a single\n\ninstance      of      humiliating          harassment         has       occurred,       then\n\nobjectionable        conduct      is   bound      to    be    repeated       at    a   level\n\nsufficient to create a hostile work environment.                             But this, of\n\ncourse,     does    not   follow.          And    I    can    anticipate      much     hand-\n\nwringing     in    the    legal      community        when    determining         whether   a\n\nparticular        incident     qualifies      as      humiliating       or    whether       it\n\nremains merely an offensive utterance.\n\n       The majority’s position is also entirely pessimistic about\n\nthe ability and desire of employers to stop the progression from\n\nisolated     utterances         of     racial         slurs    to   a     hostile       work\n\nenvironment.          Indeed,        the   majority       manifests      a    fundamental\n\ndistrust of employers, assuming that, once a humiliating epithet\n\nis uttered, the development of a hostile work environment is a\n\nfait accompli -- in other words, that employers are powerless or\n\nunwilling to prevent a descent into pervasive hostility.                                This\n\nassumption, of course, finds no more support in Title VII or\n\nSupreme Court precedent than it does in basic logic.                                What is\n\nmore, even the most conscientious employer will now be reluctant\n\nto fire an objectively underperforming employee who has reported\n\na racial epithet that could be considered humiliating because,\n\n                                            105\n\funder   the     majority’s        standard,       that    employee     is       effectively\n\npresumed to have reasonably believed that he was protesting an\n\nunlawful employment practice when he made his complaint.                                This\n\npresumption      is    at   odds    with    Title        VII,   the   Supreme        Court’s\n\njurisprudence,        and   the     fundamental      character        of    employers      in\n\nAmerica’s modern workplace.\n\n\n                                            IV\n\n       At bottom, I would conclude, as did the district court,\n\nthat    while     Clubb’s      comments         to   Liberto      were         unacceptably\n\noffensive,      they    were       made    in     connection      with         an   isolated\n\nincident, and therefore they were insufficient to demonstrate\n\nthe existence of a hostile work environment that altered the\n\nterms   and     conditions     of    Liberto’s       employment.           I    would   also\n\nconclude, as did the district court, that because Title VII’s\n\nantiretaliation        provision          requires,       as    we    have          liberally\n\nconstrued it, that an employee’s opposition must be to a hostile\n\nwork environment that she reasonably believed was in progress,\n\nLiberto’s retaliation claims also fail.                    Thus, I would affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                            106\n\f",

Boyer-Liberto,        the    African-American     plaintiff      in\n\nthese civil rights proceedings, alleges that within a single\n\ntwenty-four-hour period in September 2010, while working as a\n\ncocktail waitress at the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau Hotel in\n\nOcean City, Maryland (the “Clarion”), she was twice called a\n\n“porch monkey” and threatened with the loss of her job by a\n\nCaucasian restaurant manager.             Soon after reporting to higher-\n\nups at the hotel that she had been racially harassed, Liberto\n\nwas fired by the Clarion’s owner, Dr. Leonard P. Berger.

Thus, like\nthe district court, we accept that Liberto was called a “porch\nmonkey” on two consecutive days, and that the defendants knew of\nat least one of those alleged slurs when the decision to\ndischarge Liberto was made.   See Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau\nCorp., No. 1:12-cv-00212, slip op. at 3 n.2 (D. Md. Apr. 5,\n2013), ECF No. 52. Much of our factual recitation is drawn from\nLiberto’s   deposition  testimony;  we  do   not  rely   on  her\n(Continued)\n                                              4\n\fClarion’s       Food    and    Beverage        Department,        Liberto     worked    in\n\nassorted       roles,   including       restaurant         hostess,    restaurant      and\n\nbanquet server, bartender, and cocktail waitress.                           According to\n\nLiberto, the Clarion assigned her that variety of jobs so that\n\nshe    could    learn    all    positions         within    the    Food   and    Beverage\n\nDepartment as part of her training.\n\n        On the night of September 14, 2010, Liberto was working as\n\na cocktail waitress in the Clarion’s nightclub.                              One of her\n\ncustomers ordered a “Hula Hula,” a drink that is time-consuming\n\nto prepare.       The bartender in the adjacent main bar refused to\n\nfill    the    order,    explaining       to      Liberto    that     other     nightclub\n\npatrons would see the Hula Hula and want that drink, too.                          In an\n\neffort to please her customer and after consulting immediate\n\nsupervisor Jamie Avery, Liberto went beyond the main bar to the\n\npub bar, where she found a bartender willing to make a Hula\n\nHula.     Once the drink was prepared, Liberto wanted to avoid a\n\nconfrontation with the bartender in the main bar, so she chose a\n\nnew    path    back     to    the    nightclub      that    took    her     through    the\n\nrestaurant       kitchen.           Liberto    carried      the   Hula    Hula    briskly\n\nthrough the kitchen and across the nightclub to her customer’s\n\ntable.     She then went to a server station, which was located in\n\n\n\ninterrogatory   answers,  which  the                   district       court      properly\nexcluded from consideration. See id.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fthe nightclub several feet from the kitchen doors, to print a\n\nguest check.\n\n     At that point, Liberto was confronted by Trudi Clubb, a\n\nwhite Food and Beverage Manager at the Clarion.                      Unbeknownst to\n\nLiberto, Clubb had been yelling at Liberto as she passed through\n\nthe kitchen carrying the Hula Hula.                  Liberto soon learned that\n\nClubb was livid because she believed that Liberto had heard but\n\nignored her.         As Liberto worked at the server station, Clubb\n\ncame through the kitchen doors, loudly screaming, “Hey, girl\n\nthat can’t hear.”         J.A. 237. 2          Clubb, still shouting, quickly\n\napproached Liberto, who turned her face away from Clubb in an\n\neffort    to    remain   calm    —   a     move    that    made   Clubb    even   more\n\nfurious.       Clubb then came so close to Liberto that Liberto could\n\nfeel Clubb’s breath on her face as Clubb stood at Liberto’s\n\nside.      Indeed,    continuing      to    yell    at    Liberto,    Clubb    sprayed\n\nLiberto’s face with saliva.                Clubb’s message was that Liberto\n\nshould    have    neither    walked      through     the    kitchen      nor   ignored\n\nClubb, and Liberto repeatedly indicated that she understood and\n\nagreed.\n\n     Clubb’s      shouting      nonetheless        persisted,     even    as   Liberto\n\nleft the server station to tend to nightclub customers.                           Clubb\n\n\n     2\n       Citations herein to “J.A. __” refer to the contents of the\nJoint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fwas now loudly berating Liberto for walking away from her, at\n\nfirst following Liberto into the nightclub and then moving back\n\nto the server station.             Upon Liberto’s subsequent return to that\n\narea, Clubb finally proceeded to exit the nightclub into the\n\nkitchen.      As she did so, Clubb threatened Liberto in words that\n\nincluded, “[I’m] going to get [you]” and “[I’m] going to make\n\n[you] sorry.”        J.A. 252-53.       Clubb then concluded her threat by\n\nturning to look at Liberto and calling her either a “damn porch\n\nmonkey” or a “dang porch monkey.”             See id. at 258.\n\n      Upon    arriving       for    a   dinner    shift     the   following     day,\n\nSeptember 15, 2010, Liberto went to the Clarion’s management\n\noffice to report Clubb’s conduct to Food and Beverage Director\n\nRichard Heubeck.        Liberto had just begun talking to Heubeck when\n\nshe was interrupted by Clubb, who came into the office and said\n\nto Liberto, “I need to speak to you, little girl.”                     J.A. 263.\n\nLiberto responded that she was meeting with Heubeck, but Clubb\n\nretorted,     “I’m    more     important,”    prompting      Liberto   to     follow\n\nClubb out of the office.             Id. at 263-64.       Clubb and Liberto sat\n\nat a nearby table, and Clubb reprimanded Liberto, in a raised\n\nand   angry    voice,    for    passing    through    the    kitchen   the    prior\n\nnight.     As the two women then rose from the table and pushed in\n\ntheir chairs, Clubb threatened, “I’m gonna get you.                    I’m gonna\n\ngo to [hotel owner] Dr. Berger.”                 Id. at 266.      Her voice still\n\nloud and angry though somewhat lower than before, Clubb capped\n\n                                          7\n\fthe threat by looking directly at Liberto and again calling her\n\na “porch monkey.”               Id. at 266-68.\n\n        On September 16, 2010, Liberto arranged to speak with Human\n\nResources Director Nancy Berghauer by telephone the following\n\nday.      During the September 17 phone call, Liberto complained\n\nthat she had been racially harassed by Clubb.                                      From handwritten\n\nnotes,     Berghauer               prepared       a       typewritten          summary          of     her\n\ndiscussion       with         Liberto,         which      included          Liberto’s       allegation\n\nthat     Clubb      called          her    a     “porch         monkey”       on     September         15.\n\nBerghauer provided the summary on September 17 to Dr. Berger and\n\nGeneral       Manager         Mark     Elman,      and      Elman       met     with      Liberto      on\n\nSeptember      18        to    further         discuss      her       complaint.          Meanwhile,\n\nalthough       Clubb          denied      ever    using         the    term        “porch      monkey,”\n\nHeubeck issued her a written notice on September 18 advising\n\nthat,    as    “a     member         of   our     Food      &     Beverage         Management         team\n\n. . . , [Clubb]               is    expected      to      conduct      herself       as       such”    and\n\n“needs to be cautious the language or phrases she uses can not\n\nbe perceived as racist or derogatory.”                            J.A. 311.\n\n       According          to        Dr.    Berger,         Liberto’s          racial        harassment\n\ncomplaint of September 17, 2010, prompted him to go to Heubeck\n\nthat day and ask — for the first time ever — about Liberto’s\n\nperformance.             In        Berger’s      account,         Heubeck       gave      a    negative\n\nevaluation       of       Liberto         and     attributed            her     variety         of    job\n\nassignments         to    failure         in    every      role       she    tried;     thus,        after\n\n                                                      8\n\ffurther consulting Elman and Berghauer between September 18 and\n\n20, Berger made the decision to fire Liberto immediately.                                   At\n\nthe beginning of her scheduled shift on September 21, Liberto\n\nwas notified that she was being discharged.\n\n       Whether Clubb had been empowered by the Clarion to fire\n\nLiberto or take other tangible employment actions against her is\n\nunclear on this record.               From Liberto’s perspective during her\n\nshort time as a Clarion employee, Clubb “was just Dr. Berger’s\n\nfriend and she was just there to say hello and greet people as a\n\nglorified hostess.”          J.A. 213.            Liberto did not know that Clubb\n\nheld   a   manager       title   and    did       not    consider   Clubb         to   be   her\n\nmanager.         See id. at 214 (Liberto’s deposition testimony that\n\nshe reported to Avery and Heubeck, and that Avery told Liberto\n\n“not to go to [Clubb] because [Clubb] did not have the power to\n\ndo voids or make decisions”).                 Nevertheless, Clubb conveyed to\n\nLiberto — and Liberto got the message — that Clubb was in a\n\nposition to have Liberto terminated.                          Before she had finished\n\njust   her   second      week    of    work       at    the   Clarion,    Liberto       “felt\n\nextremely singled out” by Clubb and perceived that “my position\n\nwas being threatened” by her.                 See id. at 277-79 (discussing an\n\nAugust     16,    2010   Twitter      message          from   Liberto    to   a    co-worker\n\nsaying that Clubb is “after me like [a] starving wol[f] on a\n\nbone”).      Clubb repeatedly told Liberto “what my place was” and\n\n“always made it clear that Dr. Berger would listen to anything\n\n                                              9\n\fshe said and wouldn’t believe me.”                 Id. at 279.            Clubb’s conduct\n\nled Liberto to understand that Clubb “did have power that I did\n\nnot have.”      Id. at 274.        Consistent with that perception, Elman\n\ninformed Liberto during their September 18, 2010 meeting that\n\nClubb was Liberto’s “boss.”             See id. at 324 (September 18 email\n\nto   Heubeck    and    Berghauer      from   Elman       recounting        what    he   told\n\nLiberto).\n\n                                            B.\n\n      On January 23, 2012, after exhausting her administrative\n\nremedies       with     the    federal       government’s            Equal      Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (the “EEOC”), Liberto filed her complaint\n\nin   the   District      of    Maryland.          The    complaint         asserted     four\n\nclaims:        one     claim   each    of        hostile      work    environment        and\n\nretaliation       pursuant       to    Title        VII       against          solely    the\n\nFontainebleau         Corporation,      trading          as    the     Clarion       Resort\n\nFontainebleau         Hotel;   and     one       claim     each      of    hostile      work\n\nenvironment and retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 against both\n\nthe Fontainebleau Corporation and Dr. Berger.\n\n                                            1.\n\n      Following       discovery,      the    defendants        filed       a   motion   for\n\nsummary judgment.         Contesting the validity of the hostile work\n\nenvironment claims, the defendants focused on just one of the\n\nfour elements of such a claim, contending that there had been no\n\nshowing that Clubb’s conduct was severe or pervasive enough to\n\n                                            10\n\falter Liberto’s conditions of employment and produce an abusive\n\nwork environment.

The   majority           first    concluded           that      no    hostile   work\n\n                                                  14\n\fenvironment       actually      existed,        in       that    the    “black    monkeys”\n\ncomment — though “unacceptably crude and racist” — “was an\n\nisolated    response      directed        at    the      snipers”      rather    than   “any\n\nfellow employee.”         Id. at 339-40.             The majority underscored that\n\nthe comment “was a singular and isolated exclamation” that did\n\nnot and could not have “altered the terms and conditions of\n\n[Jordan’s]      employment,”        and    that      Jordan      did    “not    describe    a\n\nworkplace       permeated      by    racism,        by    threats      of   violence,      by\n\nimproper    interference        with      work,      or    by    conduct     resulting     in\n\npsychological harm.”           Id. at 340.\n\n     Turning to the issue of Jordan’s reasonable belief, the\n\npanel majority concluded that “no objectively reasonable person\n\ncould have believed that [Jordan’s workplace] was in the grips\n\nof a hostile work environment.”                     Jordan, 458 F.3d at 341.             But\n\nthe majority also acknowledged that, pursuant to Navy Federal,\n\nJordan could rely on a reasonable belief that a hostile work\n\nenvironment      “was    taking      shape.”             See    id.    at   340-41   (“Navy\n\nFederal     holds       that    an     employee           seeking       protection      from\n\nretaliation must have an objectively reasonable belief in light\n\nof all the circumstances that a Title VII violation has happened\n\nor is in progress.”); see also Navy Fed., 424 F.3d at 406-07\n\n(concluding that plaintiff reasonably believed she was opposing\n\nunlawful retaliation by disrupting plan that had been set in\n\nmotion     by    employer      to    terminate           another      employee    for    her\n\n                                               15\n\fdiscrimination      complaints).

From there, the majority determined that\n\nJordan could not establish a reasonable belief that a hostile\n\nwork environment was in progress, in that “no allegation in the\n\ncomplaint suggests that a plan was in motion to create such an\n\nenvironment, let alone that such an environment was even likely\n\nto   occur.”      Id.    at   340.        Accordingly,      the    majority      opinion\n\naffirmed the dismissal of Jordan’s Title VII retaliation claim,\n\nas well as his § 1981 retaliation claim.\n\n       The Jordan dissent agreed with the panel majority that, to\n\ngain protection for his opposition activity, an employee may\n\nrely on a reasonable belief that Title VII is in the process of\n\nbeing violated by the conduct being opposed.                        See Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d at 352 (King, J., dissenting) (citing Navy Fed., 424 F.3d\n\nat 406-07).       The dissent disputed the majority’s view, however,\n\nthat   Navy    Federal    requires        an    employee    opposing      a    potential\n\nhostile work environment to prove “that a plan was in motion to\n\ncreate such an environment.”              That is, the dissent distinguished\n\n                                           16\n\fthe discrete action opposed by the Navy Federal plaintiff (the\n\nimminent    retaliatory        discharge      of   another       employee)       from   the\n\nconduct     opposed    in    Jordan    (conduct      that,       if    repeated,    could\n\namount to a hostile work environment).\n\n       The Jordan dissent concluded that, “[b]y opposing racially\n\ncharged conduct that he reasonably believes could be part and\n\nparcel of a hostile work environment, a reporting employee has\n\nopposed     the    impermissible       whole,      even    absent      an   independent\n\nbasis for believing the conduct might be repeated.”                         Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d   at   354.      “Indeed,”       the    dissent      emphasized,       “we   require\n\nemployees to report such incidents in order to prevent hostile\n\nwork environments from coming into being.”                           Id.

The panel observed that Liberto had\n\n“not pointed to any Fourth Circuit case, nor could she, finding\n\nthe presence of a hostile work environment based on a single\n\nincident.”       Id. at 358 (comparing Jordan with Anderson, Conner,\n\nand Amirmokri).\n\n       The panel was split, however, with respect to Liberto’s\n\nretaliation claims.           The opinion of the panel majority validated\n\nthe district court’s summary judgment award on those claims,\n\nexplaining that, “if no objectively reasonable juror could have\n\n                                         21\n\ffound the presence of a hostile work environment, as we today\n\nhold, it stands to reason that Liberto also could not have had\n\nan objectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment\n\nexisted.”     Boyer-Liberto, 752 F.3d at 360 (emphasis omitted).\n\nAlthough    the   panel   majority        allowed   that    an     “employee’s\n\nopposition may be protected before the hostile environment has\n\nfully taken form,” the majority faulted Liberto for failing to\n\n“present any indicators that the situation at the Clarion would\n\nhave ripened into a hostile work environment.”                   Id.     In that\n\nregard, the majority equated Liberto’s case with Jordan.                      See\n\nid. (“Just as in Jordan, we conclude here that ‘while in the\n\nabstract, continued repetition of racial comments of the kind\n\n[Clubb] made might have led to a hostile work environment, no\n\nallegation in the [record] suggests that a plan was in motion to\n\ncreate such an environment, let alone that such an environment\n\nwas even likely to occur.’” (alterations in original) (quoting\n\nJordan, 458 F.3d at 340)); see also id. at 361 (Shedd, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“Based on this Court’s decision in Jordan . . . , I\n\nagree with Judge Niemeyer that summary judgment should . . . be\n\naffirmed on the retaliation claim.”).\n\n     The dissent distinguished the facts in this case from those\n\nin Jordan and concluded that, “[p]articularly in light of these\n\nsignificant   differences,   . . .    Liberto       could   have       reasonably\n\nbelieved that Clubb’s conduct was actionable.”               Boyer-Liberto,\n\n                                     22\n\f752    F.3d    at     363    (Traxler,           C.J.,      concurring     in     part      and\n\ndissenting in part) (pointing out that Jordan’s co-worker made a\n\nsingle comment not directed at Jordan or another employee, while\n\nClubb called Liberto herself “the very same name in the very\n\nsame   threatening      context”         on    two       consecutive     days).

Liberto’s        counter-\n\narguments    included          that      there       was    a    genuine     dispute       as    to\n\nwhether the          harassment         she   suffered          on   September    14    and     15,\n\n2010, was sufficiently severe.                     To resolve that issue today, we\n\nneed not — and, in any event, on this record cannot — determine\n\nwhether Clubb was actually Liberto’s supervisor or simply her\n\nco-worker,       a    fact   relevant         to     the    separate       question      of     the\n\nClarion’s vicarious liability.                     Nevertheless, we are obliged to\n\nconsider how Clubb portrayed her authority and what Liberto thus\n\nreasonably believed Clubb’s power to be.                              See Oncale, 523 U.S.\n\nat 81 (“[T]he objective severity of harassment should be judged\n\nfrom the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s\n\nposition . . . .”).\n\n     The     defendants            have       suggested          that,     because       Liberto\n\nunderstood       Clubb       to     be    a     “glorified           hostess”     and    not     a\n\nrestaurant       manager,         see    J.A.    213-14,         Liberto    could      not    have\n\n                                                30\n\freasonably perceived that Clubb’s conduct was severe enough to\n\ncreate       a    hostile    work     environment.      That   premise      ignores\n\nevidence,         however,     that     Clubb   repeatedly     and    effectively\n\ncommunicated to Liberto prior to September 14, 2010, that Clubb\n\nhad Dr. Berger’s ear and could have Liberto fired.                     See, e.g.,\n\nid. at 274 (Liberto’s deposition testimony that Clubb “did have\n\npower that I did not have”); id. at 279 (“I felt extremely\n\nsingled out and that my position was being threatened and it was\n\nvery clear.”); id. (“I was told what my place was.                     . . .    And\n\n[Clubb] always made it clear that Dr. Berger would listen to\n\nanything she said and wouldn’t believe me.”).\n\n       The       defendants’   theory    also   fails   to   take    into   account\n\nClubb’s assertion of power in the course of her harassment of\n\nLiberto.          On September 14, 2010, Clubb berated Liberto’s job\n\nperformance before threatening “to get [her]” and “make [her]\n\nsorry,” and then calling her a “damn porch monkey” or a “dang\n\nporch monkey.”         See J.A. 252-53, 258.         The following day, Clubb\n\nobstructed Liberto’s attempted report of racial harassment to\n\nFood and Beverage Director Heubeck by telling Liberto, “I need\n\nto speak to you, little girl,” and “I’m more important [than\n\nHeubeck].”         Id. at 263-64.       Immediately thereafter, Clubb again\n\nreprimanded Liberto, again threatened to “get [her]” and to “go\n\nto Dr. Berger,” and again called her a “porch monkey.”                      Id. at\n\n266.     Finally, while speaking with Liberto on September 18 about\n\n                                           31\n\fher racial harassment complaint, General Manager Elman validated\n\nClubb’s      assertion       of    authority       by       declaring      Clubb    to    be\n\nLiberto’s “boss.”          Id. at 324.\n\n      Properly        considering    that    evidence,         we    must    accept      that\n\nLiberto believed — and reasonably so — that Clubb could make a\n\ndischarge       decision     or    recommendation           that    would    be     rubber-\n\nstamped by Dr. Berger.             Thus, in gauging the severity of Clubb’s\n\nconduct, we deem Clubb to have been Liberto’s supervisor.                                Cf.\n\nVance,    133    S.    Ct.   at    2446   n.8,     2452      (recognizing      that,     for\n\npurposes of employer’s vicarious liability, employee may qualify\n\nas supervisor if she can initiate tangible employment actions\n\n“subject        to     approval      by      higher          management”       or        make\n\nrecommendations on which employer relies).                         And we view Clubb’s\n\nconduct    as    having      the   “particular          threatening        character”     of\n\nharassment perpetrated by a supervisor against her subordinate.\n\nSee Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 763.                    That perspective is especially\n\nappropriate here, where Clubb employed racial epithets to cap\n\nexplicit, angry threats that she was on the verge of utilizing\n\nher supervisory powers to terminate Liberto’s employment.\n\n      We also grasp that the use of Clubb’s chosen slur — “porch\n\nmonkey” — is about as odious as the use of the word “nigger.”\n\nSee Spriggs, 242 F.3d at 185.                    The latter epithet, of course,\n\n“is   pure      anathema     to    African-Americans.”               Id.

We reject that aspect of Jordan today, however, for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n       First    of    all,    the    Jordan       standard     “imagines       a   fanciful\n\nworld    where       bigots    announce      their       intentions     to     repeatedly\n\nbelittle racial minorities at the outset, and it ignores the\n\npossibility that a hostile work environment could evolve without\n\nsome    specific      intention      to    alter     the      working    conditions       of\n\nAfrican-Americans through racial harassment.”                         See Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d at 353-54 (King, J., dissenting).                         Tellingly, intent to\n\ncreate a hostile work environment is not an element of a hostile\n\nenvironment claim.\n\n       The   Jordan     standard      also    is    at    odds   with    the       hope   and\n\nexpectation that employees will report harassment early, before\n\n                                             38\n\fit rises to the level of a hostile environment.                                         Where the\n\nharasser is her supervisor and no tangible employment action has\n\nbeen    taken,      the     victim      is    compelled          by    the    Ellerth/Faragher\n\ndefense to make an internal complaint, i.e., “to take advantage\n\nof any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\n\nemployer.”          See   Faragher,          524    U.S.    at        807.      Similarly,       the\n\nvictim    of    a    co-worker’s          harassment        is        prudent    to     alert    her\n\nemployer in order to ensure that, if the harassment continues,\n\nshe can establish the negligence necessary to impute liability.\n\nSee Vance, 133 S. Ct. at 2453.                         The reporting obligation is\n\nessential      to     accomplishing           Title     VII’s          “primary        objective,”\n\nwhich    is    “not    to    provide         redress       but    to     avoid    harm.”         See\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 806.                    Thus, we have recognized that the\n\nvictim is commanded to “report the misconduct, not investigate,\n\ngather    evidence,         and   then       approach       company          officials.”         See\n\nMatvia v.

As the Burlington Northern Court explained, Title VII\n\nmust   be    read     “to   provide     broader       protection    for     victims    of\n\nretaliation than for [even] victims of race-based, ethnic-based,\n\nreligion-based,          or      gender-based          discrimination,”          because\n\n“effective enforcement could . . . only be expected if employees\n\nfelt free to approach officials with their grievances.”                          See 548\n\nU.S. at 66-67 (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       Finally,     we    need   look   no   further      than     Jordan     itself   to\n\ncomprehend that the Jordan standard is unsuited to its purpose.\n\nIn Jordan’s presence, his co-worker made a comment that, “in a\n\nsingle      breath,      . . .    equated        African-Americans        with    ‘black\n\nmonkeys’ and ‘black apes,’ and implied a savage, bestial sexual\n\npredilection        acutely      insulting       to   members      of   the      African-\n\nAmerican community.”             See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 351 (King, J.,\n\ndissenting).        Jordan then did exactly what Title VII hopes and\n\nexpects:      He reported the comment to his employers in an effort\n\nto avert any further racial harassment.                   Because of his internal\n\ncomplaint, however, Jordan was fired.                   In light of the text and\n\n                                            41\n\fpurpose of Title VII, as well as controlling Supreme Court and\n\nFourth Circuit decisions, Jordan surely merited protection from\n\nretaliation.       That is,\n\n     [w]ithout question, [the comment made by Jordan’s co-\n     worker] is the stuff of which a racially hostile work\n     environment is made. On the allegations here, it was\n     entirely reasonable for Jordan to believe that, in\n     reporting the racially charged ‘black monkeys’ comment\n     to his employers, he was opposing a racially hostile\n     work environment.\n\nId. at 355 (citations omitted).               But, by devising and applying\n\nthe Jordan standard, we denied Jordan any legal recourse for his\n\nretaliatory       discharge.        In   these     circumstances,         the    Jordan\n\nstandard plainly cannot endure.\n\n                                         b.\n\n     The   question,       then,    becomes       this:      What    is    the    proper\n\nstandard   for     determining      whether       an   employee     who    reports   an\n\nisolated incident of harassment has a reasonable belief that she\n\nis opposing a hostile work environment in progress?                       We conclude\n\nthat, when assessing the reasonableness of an employee’s belief\n\nthat a hostile environment is occurring based on an isolated\n\nincident, the focus should be on the severity of the harassment.\n\nCf.

That assessment thus involves\n\nfactors    used     to    judge    whether    a    workplace        is    sufficiently\n\n                                         42\n\fhostile or abusive for purposes of a hostile environment claim —\n\nspecifically, whether the discriminatory conduct “is physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance.”                          See\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 23.            Of course, a single offensive utterance\n\n—    e.g.,     “simple     teasing”       or     an   “offhand     comment[],”       see\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 788 — generally will not create a hostile\n\nenvironment without significant repetition or an escalation in\n\nthe harassment’s severity.                See Ayissi-Etoh, 712 F.3d at 579\n\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“The more severe the harassment,\n\nthe less pervasive it needs to be, and vice versa.” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).                But an isolated incident that is\n\nphysically threatening or humiliating will be closer — even if\n\nnot equal — to the type of conduct actionable on its own because\n\nit is “extremely serious.”              See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788.\n\n       Accordingly,       as   relevant     here,     an     employee    will     have   a\n\nreasonable belief that a hostile work environment is occurring\n\nbased on an isolated incident if that harassment is physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating.                This standard is consistent not\n\nonly   with       Clark   County,    but       also   with    other     Supreme    Court\n\nprecedent, including Crawford and Burlington Northern.                          That is\n\nso   because      it   protects    an    employee     like    Jordan     who    promptly\n\nspeaks up “to attack the racist cancer in his workplace,” rather\n\nthan “remain[ing] silent” and “thereby allowing [discriminatory]\n\nconduct      to     continue      unchallenged,”        while     “forfeiting        any\n\n                                           43\n\fjudicial remedy he might have.”              See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 356\n\n(King, J., dissenting).\n\n     In   sum,     under   the    standard    that   we   adopt    today   with\n\nguidance from the Supreme Court, an employee is protected from\n\nretaliation for opposing an isolated incident of harassment when\n\nshe reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in\n\nprogress, with no requirement for additional evidence that a\n\nplan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an\n\nenvironment   is    likely   to    occur.     The    employee     will   have   a\n\nreasonable belief that a hostile environment is occurring if the\n\nisolated incident is physically threatening or humiliating. 6\n\n\n     6\n       Notably, in its brief as amicus curiae supporting Liberto,\nthe EEOC urges us to adopt a standard suggested by the Jordan\ndissent:    that an employee engages in a protected opposition\nactivity when she complains about an isolated incident of\nharassment that would create a hostile work environment if\nrepeated often enough.    See Jordan, 458 F.3d at 354 (King, J.,\ndissenting) (“When the cumulative nature of such an environment\nis properly considered, it is clear that employees are protected\nunder Title VII from employer retaliation if they oppose conduct\nthat,    if   repeated,   could   amount   to   a   hostile  work\nenvironment.”).    When the isolated incident is merely offensive\n— rather than physically threatening or humiliating — the if-\nrepeated standard might well be appropriate.      Contrary to the\nargument of the defendants, it is not necessarily precluded by\nthe Supreme Court’s Clark County decision.      That is, although\nthe Court concluded that the Clark County plaintiff had not\nengaged in a protected opposition activity by reporting an\nisolated incident that was merely offensive, the Court did so by\nassessing whether the plaintiff could have reasonably believed\nthat incident alone created a hostile environment.     See 121 S.\nCt. at 270-71. The Court did not consider whether the plaintiff\ncould have reasonably believed that a hostile work environment,\neven though not fully formed, was in progress. In any event, we\n(Continued)\n                                      44\n\f                                             2.\n\n       Because        the    defendants        contested       Liberto’s          retaliation\n\nclaims on the lone ground that she did not engage in a protected\n\nactivity, our analysis is limited to whether a jury could find\n\nthat    Liberto       reasonably        believed     there      was        a    hostile      work\n\nenvironment in progress when she reported Clubb’s use of the\n\n“porch monkey” slur.              Applying the standard that we adopt today,\n\nthe answer plainly is “yes.”                      As we recognized in analyzing\n\nLiberto’s hostile work environment claims, “porch monkey” is a\n\nracial epithet that is not just humiliating, but “degrading and\n\nhumiliating in the extreme.”                     See Spriggs, 242 F.3d at 185.\n\nIndeed, we determined that a reasonable jury could find that\n\nClubb’s    two    uses       of    “porch    monkey”         were    serious       enough       to\n\nengender    a    hostile       environment.             We    must    further       conclude,\n\ntherefore,       in    the    context       of    the    retaliation            claims,      that\n\nLiberto    has    made      the    lesser    showing         that    the       harassment     was\n\nsufficiently      severe          to   render     reasonable         her       belief    that    a\n\nhostile environment was occurring.                      Accordingly, we vacate the\n\nsummary    judgment         award      on   Liberto’s        retaliation          claims,       in\n\naddition    to    her       hostile     work     environment         claims.            We   also\n\n\n\nneed not decide herein whether to embrace the if-repeated\nstandard   for   cases involving isolated, merely offensive\nincidents of harassment, because this matter involves more\nserious conduct.\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\funderscore       that,         on     remand,     a   jury      would    be     entitled       to\n\nsimultaneously reject the hostile work environment claims on the\n\nground    that       Clubb’s        conduct     was   not      sufficiently        serious    to\n\namount    to     a    hostile         environment,        but    award    relief         on   the\n\nretaliation claims by finding that Clubb’s conduct was severe\n\nenough    to     give      Liberto       a     reasonable       belief    that     a     hostile\n\nenvironment, although not fully formed, was in progress.\n\n                                                 C.\n\n       Our good dissenting colleague has a different view of the\n\ncontrolling law, the relevant facts, and even what our en banc\n\nmajority does and does not say.                       See post at 68-106 (Niemeyer,\n\nJ., dissenting).               With respect to the hostile work environment\n\nclaims, there is disagreement over what the Supreme Court meant\n\nby this sentence from Faragher:\n\n       A recurring    point   in  [our  hostile  environment]\n       opinions is that simple teasing, offhand comments, and\n       isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not\n       amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and\n       conditions of employment.\n\nSee 524 U.S. at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted).                                 We read\n\nthat     sentence         to     pronounce       that     an     isolated       incident      of\n\nharassment,          if     extremely          serious,        can   create        a     hostile\n\nenvironment.              But,      clinging     to   Faragher’s        use   of       “isolated\n\nincidents” in the plural, the dissent posits that only multiple,\n\n“extremely       serious            isolated     incidents       . . .    may      produce      a\n\nhostile work environment.”                   Post at 88.\n\n                                                 46\n\f      Clearly, it is the dissent’s interpretation of Faragher —\n\nnot   ours    —   that        is   untenable.       To   illustrate,        the   dissent\n\nelsewhere observes that a hostile environment claim “must be\n\n‘based on the cumulative effect of individual acts,’” post at 71\n\n(quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115), and that, “to be actionable\n\nunder Title VII, conduct must be so ‘severe or pervasive’ as ‘to\n\nalter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an\n\nabusive      working      environment,’”           id.   at     70   (alteration        in\n\noriginal) (emphasis added) (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67).\n\nStrikingly, the dissent does not — and surely cannot — explain\n\nwhat differentiates “isolated incidents” that must be “extremely\n\nserious,”      from      “individual        acts”    that     may    be     “severe    or\n\npervasive.”       The dissent also quotes from Morgan that “‘a single\n\nact of harassment may not be actionable on its own,’” id. at 71\n\n(quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115), without acknowledging the\n\nobvious      import      of    Morgan’s      use    of   “may    not”     rather      than\n\n“cannot.”         And,    the      dissent    itself     allows      that    a    single,\n\nisolated incident of physical violence may be actionable, id. at\n\n88, without even attempting to reconcile that proposition with\n\nits reading of Faragher.\n\n      Relatedly, the dissent criticizes us for “fail[ing] to note\n\nthat the portions of Faragher to which [we] cite[] were part of\n\nthe    Supreme        Court’s        much     lengthier       discussion          —   and\n\nsubstantively different message — describing the type of conduct\n\n                                             47\n\fthat would not violate Title VII.”              Post at 69.        In pursuing its\n\nposition, the dissent simply ignores Faragher’s use of “unless\n\nextremely serious” to designate an exception to those isolated\n\nincidents that are not unlawful on their own.\n\n     Meanwhile,      the   dissent       repeatedly          invokes    Faragher’s\n\nobservation,   “Mere    utterance     of    an    ethnic      or   racial    epithet\n\nwhich   engenders    offensive     feelings      in    an    employee   would    not\n\nsufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to violate\n\nTitle VII.”    See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).       But the dissent overemphasizes the first part\n\nof that sentence, at one point quoting the entire sentence while\n\nunderscoring   only    “[m]ere     utterance      of    an    ethnic    or   racial\n\nepithet,” see post at 69, and at another point actually omitting\n\nthe phrase “which engenders offensive feelings in an employee,”\n\nsee id. at 88.      Of course, the phrase “which engenders offensive\n\nfeelings in an employee” is a critical qualifier, signifying “a\n\nmere offensive utterance” rather than a more egregious slur that\n\nis “physically threatening or humiliating.”                   See Faragher, 524\n\nU.S. at 787-88 (explaining that the circumstances relevant to\n\ndetermining “whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or\n\nabusive”   include     “‘whether    it     is    physically        threatening   or\n\nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance’” (quoting Harris,\n\n510 U.S. at 23)).\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\f       In       any    event,   the    dissent   consistently      minimizes   the\n\nseriousness of Clubb’s two uses of the “porch monkey” slur by\n\ndeeming them to be merely offensive as a matter of law.                     To do\n\nso, the dissent invents a test under which harassment cannot\n\nrise       to    the    level   of    humiliating   unless    it    is   “publicly\n\nhumiliating,” and points out that “it appears that no one heard\n\nClubb direct the epithet at Liberto on either occasion.”                       See\n\npost at 88-89.           The dissent also flouts our mandate to view the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to Liberto, and insists that,\n\nas a fact, “Liberto thought that she was being upbraided by a\n\nco-worker, not her supervisor.”                Id. at 89.    Regardless of what\n\nelse Liberto perceived about Clubb’s status, however, there is\n\nample evidence in the record showing that Liberto reasonably\n\nbelieved that Clubb possessed the one supervisory power that\n\nmattered:         the power to follow through on her threats to have\n\nDr. Berger rubber-stamp Liberto’s discharge. 7\n\n\n       7\n       Notably, although the defendants themselves failed to\nargue in the district court that Clubb was not actually\nLiberto’s supervisor, the dissent wanders into that issue and\ndeclares it “highly doubtful that Clubb . . . would qualify as\nLiberto’s supervisor.”   See post at 84-85 (describing Clubb as\n“an employee whose only influence comes from having the ear of\nthe company’s owner because of their personal friendship”). The\ndissent’s characterization of Clubb is contradicted by portions\nof the record, including the September 18, 2010 email in which\nElman, the Clarion’s General Manager, recounted responding to\nLiberto’s racial harassment complaint by advising her that she\nand Clubb “need[ed] to learn to work together on a professional\nlevel and that [Clubb] was [Liberto’s] boss.” J.A. 324. Rather\n(Continued)\n                                          49\n\f       As for the retaliation claims, the dissent accuses our en\n\nbanc    majority   of   “gratuitously   proceed[ing]   to   adopt   an\n\nunprecedented standard . . . that is much broader than necessary\n\nto resolve Liberto’s claim[s].”         Post at 93.    The dissent’s\n\naccusation rests on the false premise that we hold as a matter\n\nof law that a hostile work environment existed.        In reality, we\n\nsimply conclude that a reasonable jury could find for Liberto\n\nwith respect to her hostile environment claims.        Because it is\n\npossible that Liberto will instead come up short at trial on\n\nthose claims, our retaliation analysis is essential.        Indeed, we\n\nhave emphasized that a jury may find that Clubb’s conduct was\n\ninsufficiently serious to engender a hostile environment, but\n\nsevere enough to protect Liberto from retaliation by rendering\n\nreasonable her belief that such an environment was underway.\n\n\n\n\nthan grappling with that important evidence from the Clarion’s\nown General Manager, the dissent chastises us for considering\nwhat it glibly terms “Elman’s apparent understanding of Clubb’s\nrelationship to Liberto.” See post at 86 n.*.\n\n     Meanwhile, two other of our good colleagues deem Clubb to\nhave been Liberto’s mere co-worker and thereby conclude that the\nClarion cannot be held vicariously liable for Clubb’s harassment\nof Liberto.    See post at 56-58 (Wilkinson, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part, joined by Agee, J.).          Those\ncolleagues not only disregard evidence that Clubb was Liberto’s\nsupervisor, but also urge affirmance of the summary judgment\naward with respect to the hostile environment claims on a ground\nthat the defendants failed to raise or preserve in the district\ncourt.\n\n\n\n                                  50\n\f       Unfortunately, there are further instances of the dissent’s\n\ninaccurate portrayal of today’s decision.                          For example, although\n\nwe observe herein that our standard “protects an employee like\n\nJordan” from retaliation, the dissent asserts that we nowhere\n\n“indicate that the plaintiff in Jordan had a reasonable belief\n\nthat a hostile work environment was taking shape at the time he\n\nreported       his    co-worker’s       racist         comment     to    his    supervisors.”\n\nSee post at 99.            So, for the sake of clarity (though too late to\n\nbenefit Jordan himself), we state in plain terms that a jury\n\napplying our standard could have found that Jordan reasonably\n\nbelieved       he    was     opposing      a    hostile       environment       in   progress.\n\nThat is because the “black monkeys” comment uttered to Jordan —\n\nlike the “porch monkey” slurs aimed at Liberto — could readily\n\nbe deemed physically threatening or humiliating.\n\n       We are entirely unswayed by the dissent’s warning that our\n\nstandard       “will       generate     widespread           litigation     over      the    many\n\noffensive workplace comments made everyday that employees find\n\nto   be    humiliating.”             See       post    at    93-94.       Our     standard    is\n\nimplicated          solely    when    an       employee        suffers    retaliation        for\n\nengaging in an oppositional activity, and can be satisfied only\n\nby showing the objective reasonableness of the employee’s belief\n\nthat      an    isolated         incident         of     harassment         was      physically\n\nthreatening          or    humiliating.           We        also   reject      the   dissent’s\n\nprediction          that   our   “standard        will       surely     generate      many    new\n\n                                                 51\n\fquestions” and “much hand-wringing” over which harassing conduct\n\nqualifies as sufficiently severe.               See id. at 96, 105.         Judges\n\nand juries have been identifying what is humiliating, as well as\n\nwhat is physically threatening or merely offensive, since at\n\nleast 1993, when the Supreme Court explained in Harris how to\n\ndetermine whether a workplace is objectively hostile or abusive\n\nfor purposes of a hostile environment claim.                   See 510 U.S. at\n\n23. 8\n\n        Finally, we are perplexed and dismayed by the dissent’s\n\nassertions that, on the one hand, “Liberto had every right to be\n\noffended by Clubb’s use of a racial epithet and acted reasonably\n\nand responsibly in reporting the incident,” see post at 98, and\n\nthat, on the other hand, Liberto spoke up too soon and thereby\n\ndeprived herself of protection from retaliation.                 As the dissent\n\nwould have it, although reporting Clubb’s slur was a sensible\n\nthing       to   do,    Liberto    should      have   waited    for     additional\n\nharassment       to    occur   —   but   not   so   much   harassment    that   the\n\n\n        8\n       Two of our colleagues issue dire warnings that today’s\ndecision may cause “employers [to] become speech police,”\n“employees [to be] estranged from one another,” and “companies\n[to] become private sector analogues of the surveillance state.”\nSee post at 55 (Wilkinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part, joined by Agee, J.). We cannot agree, however, that by\nsimply protecting an employee who, for example, reports a race-\nbased comment that she reasonably believes to be physically\nthreatening or humiliating, we might somehow silence or\nsegregate the workforce.\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fClarion could avoid vicarious liability because of a lack of\n\ntimely notice.        Concomitantly, the dissent contends that our\n\ndecision     “manifests      a   fundamental      distrust        of    employers,\n\nassuming    that,    once    a   humiliating     epithet     is    uttered,    the\n\ndevelopment of a hostile work environment is a fait accompli —\n\nin other words, that employers are powerless or unwilling to\n\nprevent a descent into pervasive hostility.”              Id. at 105.\n\n     Contrary to the dissent, we seek to promote the hope and\n\nexpectation — ingrained in our civil rights laws and the Supreme\n\nCourt decisions interpreting them — that employees will report\n\nharassment early, so that their employers can stop it before it\n\nrises to the level of a hostile environment.                      Employers are\n\npowerless    in     that    regard   only   if    they     are     unaware    that\n\nharassment is occurring.          But employees will understandably be\n\nwary of reporting abuse for fear of retribution.                   Under today’s\n\ndecision, employees who reasonably perceive an incident to be\n\nphysically threatening or humiliating do not have to wait for\n\nfurther     harassment      before   they   can    seek    help        from   their\n\nemployers without exposing themselves to retaliation.\n\n\n\n\n                                      53\n\f                              IV.\n\n     Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for such other and further proceedings\n\nas may be appropriate.\n\n                                            VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               54\n\fWILKINSON, Circuit Judge, with whom AGEE, Circuit Judge, joins,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n       The remarks alleged in this Title VII action are ones that\n\nAmericans of every race and all walks of life would find so\n\nwounding    that   the     word      offensive     does    not    begin     to   describe\n\nthem. It is incidents such as these, small as they may appear,\n\nthat   prevent     our    larger      society      from   becoming      the      place    of\n\nwelcome it needs to be.\n\n       The good done by the civil rights laws has been enormous\n\nand one aim of those laws, as I understand it, is to make the\n\nworkplace    an     environment          where     Americans       of      every     race,\n\nreligion, sex, or national origin would actually want to work.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 and 2000e-3.\n\n       To say that a good workplace environment is poisoned by the\n\nkind of remarks alleged here is an understatement.

In this case I would\n\ndecline to hold the employer vicariously liable on the merits of\n\nthe hostile work environment claim, but I would allow Boyer-\n\nLiberto’s retaliation claim to proceed. In fact, were the truth\n\nof her complaint ascertained by the employer, the “retaliation”\n\nshould have taken the form of Clubb’s dismissal and not Boyer-\n\nLiberto’s.\n\n\n\n                                          I.\n\n       As to the merits of the hostile work environment claim, I\n\nwould affirm the judgment of the district court on the grounds\n\nthat   any   other   result       would   stretch    the    notion    of    vicarious\n\nemployer     liability   past      the    breaking   point.    There       may   be   an\n\nunderstandable temptation to land hard on this employer, but\n\nthere are dangers down the road. Holding employers liable for\n\nremarks made by one of their employees where the majority points\n\nto   no   prior   notice     to    the    employer    and    no     prior    employer\n\nawareness of Clubb’s racist tendencies is all too open-ended. To\n\nbe   sure,   an   employer    is    “directly    liable”      for    a   co-worker’s\n\nunlawful harassment if “the employer was negligent with respect\n\nto the offensive behavior.” Vance v. Ball State Univ., 133 S.\n\nCt. 2434, 2441 (2013). But while the majority tries to make it\n\nappear as though some other evidence of employer malfeasance may\n\nbe somewhere in the offing, see Maj.

It does not\n\nherald     for   future     courts       the   dangers     of      taking     the    American\n\nworkplace down a more autocratic path.\n\n                                               B.\n\n      The     objects       of     civil       rights    laws       are      to     eliminate\n\ndiscrimination,           bring     Americans       together,          and       break     down\n\nbarriers.        This     purpose     remains        crucial,          as    Congress        has\n\nrepeatedly attested. And yet our schools are resegregating. Our\n\nneighborhoods in all too many instances are very far apart.

Title VII will be counter-\n\nproductive, however, if it countenances workplaces over-reliant\n\non employee surveillance and reportage. Such a system erects\n\nbarriers rather than dismantles them. In an ideal world, the\n\nraces and sexes would interact spontaneously, in natural and\n\ncreative ways. There would be no single correct way to behave\n\naround, no single correct thing to say to, a worker of another\n\nrace    or     gender.       We   are     people    --     human      beings     --        with\n\ncommonalities far more profound than superficial differences.\n\n       The     majority      surely     agrees.

First,    in    the    very       quotation      relied     on   by    the\n\nmajority, the Faragher Court noted that “isolated incidents” --\n\n                                               68\n\fusing the plural -- might, if “extremely serious,” satisfy the\n\nseverity requirement for racial harassment.                              524 U.S. at 788.\n\nTo rationalize its holding, the majority thus reads the plural\n\n“incidents” in Faragher to refer only to a “single incident.”\n\n       Second, and more importantly, the majority fails to note\n\nthat the portions of Faragher to which it cites were part of the\n\nSupreme Court’s much lengthier discussion -- and substantively\n\ndifferent message -- describing the type of conduct that would\n\nnot violate Title VII.             In that discussion, the Court drew on\n\nseveral   opinions    from       the     courts       of     appeals      and       noted,       for\n\ninstance,   that    the     “‘mere       utterance          of    an   ethnic        or    racial\n\nepithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee’ would\n\nnot sufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to\n\nviolate Title VII.”         Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787 (emphasis added)\n\n(quoting Rogers v.

We directed courts to\n      determine whether an environment is sufficiently\n      hostile   or    abusive    by    looking   at   all   the\n      circumstances,    including    the   frequency    of  the\n      discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is\n      physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere\n      offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably\n      interferes with an employee’s work performance.      Most\n      recently,   we   explained    that  Title VII   does  not\n      prohibit genuine but innocuous differences in the ways\n      men and women routinely interact with members of the\n      same sex and of the opposite sex.       A recurring point\n      in these opinions is that simple teasing, off-hand\n      comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely\n      serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in\n      the terms and conditions of employment.\n\nId. at 787-88 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      Without    the       abridged    Faragher        snippets,    which   fail   to\n\ncapture that case’s larger message, the majority is left with\n\nvirtually no support for its holdings and certainly none from\n\nthe   language        of   Title VII     or      any    Supreme    Court    decision\n\nconstruing      it.

The\n\nClarion is a typical oceanfront hotel, with several restaurants,\n\nbars,   a    nightclub,            and    banquet      facilities,        and    it    typically\n\nemploys about 75 people in its Food and Beverage Department.\n\nLiberto      started         as     a    morning       hostess     in    the    hotel’s      main\n\nrestaurant, but she proceeded to work in many of the hotel’s\n\nother       Food       and         Beverage      positions,             including       serving,\n\nbartending, and working banquets.                        According to Leonard Berger,\n\nthe Clarion’s owner, Liberto struggled in all of the positions\n\n\n                                                 72\n\fto which she was assigned, and he terminated her employment on\n\nSeptember 21, 2010, because she “had failed at four jobs” and\n\n“[t]here [were] no more places for her.”\n\n     During her employment, Liberto interacted with Trudi Clubb,\n\na white woman, who was a longtime employee at the Clarion and a\n\nfriend    of    Berger’s.           Clubb    worked       part-time   as       an    evening\n\nrestaurant manager, and she described her responsibilities in\n\nthat role as “getting things going for the early part of the\n\nday, seeing that the crew is well-equipped and ready to present\n\nthemselves to the customers, getting the tables ready, getting\n\nthe buffet . . . ready, overseeing all the items that need to be\n\ndone,”    and   generally       helping      out     as    needed.    Clubb         directly\n\nreported to Richard Heubeck, the Clarion’s Food and Beverage\n\nDirector, as well as Mark Elman, the hotel’s General Manager.\n\nClubb did not participate in hiring decisions, and there is no\n\nindication      in    the    record     that      she     was   authorized          to   fire,\n\ndemote, or otherwise take tangible employment actions against\n\nother members of the Clarion’s staff.\n\n     In any event, whatever the exact nature of Clubb’s role at\n\nthe Clarion, Liberto testified during her deposition that she\n\nnever understood Clubb to be a supervisor or even a manager.                               To\n\nbe sure, Liberto believed that Clubb, who had worked at the\n\nClarion    for       close     to     20     years        and   had   a    longstanding\n\nrelationship         with    Berger,       had    power     that   she,    a    brand-new\n\n                                             73\n\femployee, did not have.           But Liberto stated that she reported to\n\nHeubeck and to a manager named Jamie Avery, and she was adamant\n\nthat she never thought of Clubb as her manager.                     Instead, her\n\n“understanding of . . . Clubb was that she was basically a\n\nfriend of Dr. Berger’s that was there to greet people and just\n\nto be a smiling face” -- in other words, that Clubb was merely a\n\n“glorified hostess.”         Indeed, Liberto stated that she was “told\n\nby everyone” that she should just “humor” Clubb and that Avery\n\nspecifically told her “not to go to [Clubb] because [Clubb] did\n\nnot   have   the     power   to    do   voids   or    make   decisions.”        She\n\nexplained that, although she listened to Clubb, she did so only\n\nto the extent that she had “to be respectful and listen to\n\neveryone     [she]     work[ed]      with.”          And   while    Clubb     would\n\noccasionally ask Liberto or other employees to do tasks, Liberto\n\ntestified that “it was not a regular routine . . . [for Clubb\n\nto] instruct[]” other employees and that Clubb did not correct\n\nher work.\n\n      Liberto testified that, soon after she had started working\n\nat the Clarion, she felt as though Clubb had “singled [her] out”\n\nand   had    threatened       to     take     advantage      of    her   personal\n\nrelationship with Berger to make trouble for Liberto.                       But the\n\nincident central to this action occurred more than a month after\n\nLiberto had been hired.\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\f     Late    on   the   night    of   September     14,    Liberto    was   serving\n\ndrinks when a customer ordered a “Hula Hula,” a cocktail that\n\nwas particularly time-consuming to make.                  When the bartender at\n\nthe restaurant’s primary bar refused to make the drink, Liberto\n\nwalked around to the Clarion’s “pub bar” to order the drink\n\nthere.      Once the drink was ready, Liberto passed through the\n\nkitchen on her way back to the dining room, even though that was\n\na much longer route, so as to avoid the primary bartender who\n\nrefused to make the “Hula Hula.”                 As she did so, Clubb yelled\n\nout to Liberto that she was not supposed to cut through the\n\nkitchen, but Liberto did not hear Clubb.                  Clubb then approached\n\nLiberto as she was preparing the customer’s check, yelling at\n\nLiberto for ignoring her and calling Liberto “deaf.”                        Liberto\n\nsaid that the distance between the two was close enough that she\n\ncould    “feel    [Clubb’s]     breath”    and    that    spittle    from   Clubb’s\n\nmouth was hitting her.          Liberto shook her head and said “okay,”\n\nbut largely went about her work, which made Clubb more agitated.\n\nAs the episode concluded and Clubb was walking away, Clubb said\n\nthat she was “going to make [Liberto] sorry” and called Liberto\n\neither a “damn or dang, porch monkey.”\n\n     At the beginning of her shift on September 15, Liberto went\n\nto Heubeck’s office to complain about Clubb’s conduct.                       During\n\nthe meeting, Clubb came in and said to Liberto, “I need to speak\n\nto you, little girl.”         Liberto told Clubb that she was currently\n\n                                          75\n\fspeaking with Heubeck, but Clubb responded that she was “more\n\nimportant.”      Liberto and Clubb then sat down at a table outside\n\nHeubeck’s      office,      and    Clubb     scolded      Liberto     for    “abandoning\n\n[her] station” the previous night.                      As this meeting broke up,\n\nClubb said that “she was going to go to Dr. Berger” and “teach\n\n[Liberto] a lesson.”              Using a raised voice, Clubb again called\n\nLiberto a “porch monkey.”\n\n      A   couple     of    days    later,        on   September   17,   2010,      Liberto\n\nspoke by telephone with Nancy Berghauer, the Clarion’s Human\n\nResources Director, regarding Clubb.                    Berghauer made typewritten\n\nnotes     of   the   conversation          and    forwarded    them     to   Berger       and\n\nElman.     The next day, September 18, Elman met with Liberto to\n\ndiscuss the situation and to ensure that Berghauer’s notes were\n\naccurate.      That same day, Heubeck met with Clubb to discuss the\n\nincident,      and     Clubb      denied    Liberto’s       allegations.           Heubeck\n\nnonetheless issued Clubb a written warning.\n\n      When, on September 17, Berger learned about the conflict\n\nbetween Clubb and Liberto, he asked Heubeck to update him on\n\n“exactly what was going on,” and he also asked about Liberto’s\n\njob   performance.          Heubeck        reported     that   Liberto       had   so     far\n\nperformed poorly in every job to which she had been assigned.\n\nThe next afternoon, Berger met with Elman to review Liberto’s\n\nwork file and discovered that Liberto had failed the Clarion’s\n\nbartending      test      “miserably.”           When   Berger    indicated        that   he\n\n                                             76\n\fthought the Clarion should terminate Liberto’s employment, Elman\n\nand Berghauer indicated that doing so “could create a situation”\n\nbecause of Liberto’s complaint.                  Berger replied that “there’s\n\nnot going to be any good time to let her go.                     The situation will\n\nbe there.”        After further consulting Heubeck, Berger made the\n\nfinal decision to terminate Liberto’s employment, and Liberto\n\nwas notified of the decision on September 21.                         Clubb was not\n\ninvolved in the decision, only learning of it a week later.\n\nBerger acknowledged in his deposition that Liberto’s complaint\n\nprompted him to take a look at her record, but he asserted that\n\nhis decision to fire her “had nothing to do with her complaint”\n\nand was instead based solely on her poor performance.\n\n     Liberto filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment    Opportunity         Commission      (“EEOC”)       on   September      23,\n\n2010, alleging discrimination based on her race and retaliation\n\nbased on her engagement in protected activity, in violation of\n\nTitle VII.        The EEOC issued Liberto a Notice of Right to Sue,\n\nfollowing which Liberto commenced this action.\n\n     In her complaint, Liberto asserted four claims for relief:\n\ntwo counts of racial discrimination by virtue of a hostile work\n\nenvironment, in violation of Title VII (Count I) and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981    (Count    III),   and     two   counts      of    retaliation,      also   in\n\nviolation    of     Title   VII    (Count       II)   and   §    1981     (Count   IV).\n\nLiberto     filed     her    Title        VII     claims        against     only     the\n\n                                          77\n\fFontainebleau       Corporation,         trading       as     the        Clarion      Resort\n\nFontainebleau        Hotel,       but       named     both        the      Fontainebleau\n\nCorporation and Berger as defendants in her § 1981 claims.\n\n      Following     discovery,        the    defendants          filed    a    motion       for\n\nsummary    judgment.        Taking      Liberto’s      deposition          testimony         as\n\ntrue, the district court held that the offensive conduct was too\n\nisolated    to    support      Liberto’s      claims       for    discrimination            and\n\nretaliation.       Accordingly, by order dated April 4, 2013, the\n\ncourt entered judgment in favor of the defendants.                             This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                            II\n\n      In   holding      that    the     district      court       erred       by    entering\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants on Liberto’s hostile work\n\nenvironment      claims,    the    majority      extends         Title    VII       liability\n\nbeyond the statute’s textual scope and beyond what the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized in construing the statute.\n\n      The governing principles are well established.                               Title VII\n\nmakes it “an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . .\n\nto   discriminate       against    any      individual       with       respect       to    his\n\ncompensation,      terms,      conditions,       or   privileges         of    employment,\n\nbecause    of    such   individual’s        race,     color,       religion,         sex,    or\n\nnational origin.”          42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).                    “This provision\n\nobviously   prohibits       discrimination          with    respect       to       employment\n\n\n                                            78\n\fdecisions       that    have    direct       economic             consequences,         such       as\n\ntermination,      demotion,         and    pay     cuts.”           Vance    v.

Instead, courts\n\nmust determine “whether an environment is sufficiently hostile\n\nor    abusive      [to    support   a     claim]       by   ‘looking     at    all     the\n\ncircumstances,’ including the ‘frequency of the discriminatory\n\nconduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or\n\n                                           81\n\fhumiliating,    or    a   mere    offensive    utterance;     and       whether    it\n\nunreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.’”\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 787-88 (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23).\n\n      Under these controlling principles, Clubb’s alleged use of\n\nthe term “porch monkey” twice in less than 24 hours when talking\n\nabout a single incident was, as a matter of law, not so severe\n\nor pervasive as to produce a racially hostile work environment\n\nthat changed the terms and conditions of Liberto’s employment.\n\n      There is no suggestion by the majority that the alleged\n\nharassment was sufficiently pervasive to qualify -- nor could\n\nthere be.      As such, this case falls outside the heartland of\n\nhostile work environment claims, the “very nature [of which]\n\ninvolves repeated conduct.”           Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115.            Instead,\n\nthe   only   question     at   this   juncture      is   whether    a    jury    that\n\nbelieved Liberto’s description of events could find that Clubb’s\n\nconduct was so severe that it altered the terms and conditions\n\nof Liberto’s employment by creating a work atmosphere that was\n\nobjectively racially hostile.          The answer is plainly no.                To be\n\nsure, the term “porch monkey” is an odious racial epithet, and\n\nany reasonable person in Liberto’s position would of course be\n\noffended by its use.           But the “‘mere utterance of an ethnic or\n\nracial epithet,’” which offends an employee, does not “affect\n\nthe   conditions     of   employment    to    [a]   sufficiently        significant\n\ndegree to violate Title VII.”           Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67 (quoting\n\n                                       82\n\fRogers, 454 F.2d at 238); see also Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.                              In\n\nshort,       Liberto   has     not   presented        evidence      from       which    a\n\nreasonable jury could find that her workplace was “permeated\n\nwith   ‘discriminatory        intimidation,       ridicule,      and   insult’       that\n\n[was] ‘sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions\n\nof [her] employment and create an abusive working environment.’”\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 21 (citation omitted) (quoting Meritor, 477\n\nU.S. at 65, 67).\n\n       The     majority’s     conclusion    to    the    contrary      rests    on     two\n\ndistortions, one factual and one legal.                       First, the majority\n\nbrazenly distorts the facts contained in the summary judgment\n\nrecord regarding Liberto’s understanding of Clubb’s role at the\n\nClarion.       The majority begins by stating that the current record\n\ndoes     not    establish      “whether     Clubb       was   actually      Liberto’s\n\nsupervisor      or   simply    her   co-worker.”         Ante,    at   30   (emphasis\n\nadded).      But nonetheless it then proceeds to “deem Clubb to have\n\nbeen   Liberto’s       supervisor”    for       the   purpose    of    “gauging        the\n\nseverity of Clubb’s conduct,” ante, at 32, on the theory that\n\nClubb portrayed herself as having the ability to get Liberto\n\nfired by taking advantage of her friendship with Berger.                             From\n\nthis, the majority goes yet further and presumes that Liberto\n\nmust have believed that Clubb was effectively her supervisor,\n\nthus lending a “particularly threatening character” to Clubb’s\n\n\n\n                                           83\n\fconduct.

First, it is highly doubtful that Clubb,\n\nwho   may     have     wielded     influence       on    the     Clarion’s       owner      as    a\n\nresult      of     a    personal      relationship         but     who     lacked        direct\n\nauthority        to    take     tangible      employment         actions     or        even      to\n\nrecommend formally that such actions be taken, would qualify as\n\nLiberto’s        supervisor.          Indeed,       the     Supreme       Court        recently\n\nclarified what makes an employee a “supervisor” in the context\n\nof hostile work environment claims, holding that the critical\n\nconsideration is whether “he or she is empowered by the employer\n\nto take tangible employment actions against the victim.”                                 Vance,\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2439 (emphasis added).                       In so holding, the Court\n\nexplained        that     this     definition           would     typically       allow          an\n\nemployee’s         supervisory        status       to     be     “readily        determined,\n\ngenerally by written documentation.”                      Id. at 2443; see also id.\n\nat 2449 (“The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that\n\nwe adopt today is one that can be readily applied”).                               The Court\n\nindicated that employees can still qualify as supervisors even\n\nif    their      “decisions       [are]    subject         to     approval        by     higher\n\nmanagement.”           Id. at 2446 n.8.            It similarly noted that if the\n\nindividuals        vested     with    decisionmaking            power    “have    a     limited\n\nability       to       exercise       independent         discretion         when        making\n\n                                              84\n\fdecisions” and must instead “rely on [the recommendations of]\n\nother workers who actually interact with the affected employee”\n\nthen “the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the\n\npower to take tangible employment actions to the employees on\n\nwhose     recommendations            [the     individual          formally       vested     with\n\ndecisionmaking authority] relies.”                         Id. at 2452.           But both of\n\nthose    situations      are    a     far     cry    from       an    employee     whose    only\n\ninfluence      comes     from    having       the     ear       of   the    company’s      owner\n\nbecause of their personal friendship.\n\n     Moreover,        even     setting       that     issue       aside,     the   majority’s\n\nassumption       that    Liberto        must        have    perceived        Clubb    as    her\n\nsupervisor       flies    in     the        face     of     Liberto’s       own    deposition\n\ntestimony       about    her    understanding              of     Clubb’s    place    in    the\n\nClarion’s      hierarchy.            When    asked        about      her   understanding      of\n\nClubb’s role, Liberto responded, “My understanding of Trud[i]\n\nClubb was that she was basically a friend of Dr. Berger’s that\n\nwas there to greet people and just to be a smiling face.”                                    She\n\nadded,    “I    was     told    by    everyone,           oh,   just,      you    know,    humor\n\n[Clubb]. . . . [T]hat’s pretty much what everyone would say\n\nabout her.”           When pressed, she was adamant that she did not\n\nunderstand Clubb to be a manager:\n\n     Q.   Isn’t it true that you were told that [Clubb] was\n     the restaurant manager?\n\n     A.        Never.\n\n\n                                               85\n\f      Q.   Is it your -- is it your testimony that you did\n      not know Trud[i] Clubb was the restaurant manager?\n\n      A.      Absolutely that is my testimony.\n\n      Q.   You never knew throughout your entire employment\n      with the Clarion that she was a manager?\n\n      A.   Never.   I reported to Jamie [Avery], and Jamie,\n      as a matter of fact, told me not to go to [Clubb]\n      because [Clubb] did not have the power to do voids or\n      make decisions.   I had to report to Jamie or Richard\n      [Heubeck].   And at the time [Clubb] did not hold any\n      management cards or keys as Jamie did.\n\n(Emphasis added).       And when asked whether she “thought [she] had\n\nto   listen    to   [Clubb],”   Liberto’s   response   was   just   that   she\n\n“ha[d] to be respectful and listen to everyone [she] work[ed]\n\nwith.” ∗\n\n      The majority’s conclusion that we should “deem Clubb to\n\nhave been Liberto’s supervisor” for the purpose of “gauging the\n\nseverity of Clubb’s conduct” simply cannot be reconciled with\n\nthis testimony.        To the contrary, Liberto’s understanding of\n\n      ∗\n        In support of its dubious contention that Liberto\nperceived Clubb to be in a position to have her employment\nterminated, the majority points to a September 18, 2010 email\nfrom Elman to Heubeck and Berghauer in which Elman recounted his\nmeeting earlier that day with Liberto. See ante, at 10. Elman\nwrote that he had informed Liberto that Clubb was her “boss.”\nBut as the majority itself acknowledges, at this stage of the\ncase, we must accept the version of events Liberto recited in\nher deposition testimony.   See ante, at 4 n.1.    And Liberto’s\ntestimony contradicts Elman’s apparent understanding of Clubb’s\nrelationship to Liberto.    Moreover, in light of the adamancy\nwith which Liberto testified that she “never” understood Clubb\nto be a manager, we should not use Elman’s email to refute\nLiberto’s clearly stated understanding.\n\n\n\n                                     86\n\fClubb   as    a   “glorified          hostess”        who     everyone        “humor[ed]”\n\nsubstantially     lessens           the     impact      that        Clubb’s       isolated\n\nstatements could have had on Liberto’s work environment.                                 See\n\nante, at 27 (“[A] supervisor’s use of [a racial epithet] impacts\n\nthe work environment far more severely than use by co-equals”\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Rodgers v. Wis.

Specifically, the\n\nmajority     places   a   great        deal      of   emphasis       on     the     Court’s\n\nobservation in Faragher that “simple teasing, offhand comments,\n\nand   isolated    incidents         (unless      extremely         serious)       will   not\n\namount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of\n\nemployment.’” 524 U.S. at 788 (emphasis added) (citation and\n\nsome internal quotation marks omitted).                      Indeed, the majority’s\n\nholding,     distilled    to     its       essence,     rests       entirely       on    its\n\nconclusion    that    this     is     “the    type     of    case     contemplated       in\n\nFaragher where the harassment, though perhaps ‘isolated,’ can\n\nproperly be deemed to be ‘extremely serious.’”                       Ante, at 34.\n\n\n\n                                            87\n\f      But in Faragher, the Supreme Court referred to “incidents,”\n\n524 U.S. at 788, not to a single incident.                                 And five years\n\nlater, the Court in Morgan confirmed that “repeated conduct” is\n\nthe   stuff    of     a    hostile     work       environment.            536    U.S.    at   115\n\n(emphasis added).             Moreover, while the Faragher Court did not\n\nelaborate on what it envisioned as the kind of extremely serious\n\nisolated incidents that may produce a hostile work environment,\n\nwe know from Meritor and Harris that such incidents cannot be\n\nthe “mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet.”                                    Meritor,\n\n477   U.S.    at 67        (quoting    Rogers,          454   F.2d    at    238)       (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).                As the Court has made clear, the\n\nmaking of such a statement in the workplace, although highly\n\noffensive,      “does       not     sufficiently          affect     the        conditions    of\n\nemployment to implicate Title VII.”                      Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.              It\n\nis true that Clubb’s alleged conduct was reprehensible.                                  But it\n\ninvolved no physical assault or threat of physical harm.                                  Cf. 3\n\nLex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination § 46.05[3][b], at 46-82\n\n(2d   ed.     2012)       (noting     that    “a     single     incident          of    physical\n\nassault       against         a      co-worker           that        is     motivated         by\n\n[discriminatory]            animus     can        qualify      as    severe        enough     to\n\nconstitute      an        alteration    of        the    co-worker’s            conditions     of\n\nemployment”).         Moreover, even though the first encounter took\n\nplace in a crowded dining room, it appears that no one heard\n\nClubb     direct      the     epithet        at    Liberto      on        either       occasion,\n\n                                              88\n\findicating that the name-calling was not publicly humiliating.\n\nAnd again, Liberto thought that she was being upbraided by a co-\n\nworker,       not         her    supervisor.              Taken        together,        these\n\nconsiderations show that, as a matter of law, Clubb’s alleged\n\nconduct     did     not    amount     to    the    “extremely      serious”        “isolated\n\nincidents” that the Faragher Court envisioned as being capable\n\nof    effecting       a    “discriminatory         change[]       in    the    ‘terms      and\n\nconditions of [the plaintiff’s] employment.’”                      524 U.S. at 788.\n\n       The majority acknowledges that this case marks the first\n\ntime that our court has concluded that a reasonable jury could\n\nfind the presence of a hostile work environment based on what\n\nwas,   at     most,       two   repeated     statements     relating          to   a   single\n\nincident.         See      ante,    at     34.     What    the     majority        does    not\n\nacknowledge, however, is that today’s decision makes our court\n\nan outlier among the other courts of appeals.                            And instead of\n\nbeing straightforward about that fact, the majority attempts to\n\nbolster its conclusion with citations to the Eleventh Circuit’s\n\ndecision in Adams v.

But the\n\nsame plaintiff also alleged that he “saw one coworker wear a\n\nshirt with a Confederate flag”; that he “regularly saw racist\n\ngraffiti in the men’s restroom”; and that when he reported the\n\nracist graffiti, his supervisor responded by saying that “it’s\n\nalways been like that and if [he] didn’t like it [he could]\n\nquit.”         Id.   at       1253    (alterations          in     original)      (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).              It was based on the totality of these\n\nallegations       that     the       Eleventh      Circuit        concluded      that     “the\n\nharassment [the plaintiff] experienced was frequent and severe,”\n\nsuch    that     “[a]    reasonable         jury    could     find    that       [his]   work\n\nenvironment was objectively hostile.”                       Id. at 1253-54 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       Similarly,       the    harassment         in    Ayissi-Etoh        was    both    more\n\npervasive and more severe than the harassment at issue here.                               In\n\nthat case, the plaintiff -- an African-American senior financial\n\nmodeler -- asked his company’s Chief Audit Executive why he had\n\nnot received a raise in conjunction with a recent promotion.\n\n712 F.3d at 574-75.            In response, the Executive told him, “For a\n\nyoung    black    man     smart      like    you,      we   are    happy    to    have    your\n\nexpertise; I think I’m already paying you a lot of money.”                                Id.\n\nat   575   (internal       quotation        marks       omitted).          Several      months\n\nlater, the plaintiff was discussing his work responsibilities\n\n                                             90\n\fwith the company’s Vice President of Internal Audit when the\n\nmeeting “became heated” and the Vice President yelled at him,\n\n“Get out of my office nigger.”                   Id.        Although the plaintiff\n\nmissed work and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, he was\n\nforced to continue working with the Vice President during the\n\nensuing three-month investigation.                   Id.    Based on this evidence,\n\nthe D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiff was entitled to a jury\n\ntrial    on     his    hostile        work      environment          claim.                These\n\ncircumstances     in     Ayissi-Etoh      are    readily         distinguishable            from\n\nthose presented here.          First, as the court in Ayissi-Etoh noted,\n\nthe hostile work environment was precipitated not by a single\n\nevent,   but    rather    by   two    independent          statements          made    by    two\n\ndifferent      high-ranking       company            officials       who        were        both\n\nindisputably     supervisors         of   the    plaintiff.              Id.    at    577-78.\n\nThose statements ultimately led to psychological problems and\n\ndirectly      caused   the     plaintiff        to    miss       work.         Id.    at 577.\n\nSecond, the racist comments were made during conversations about\n\nthe plaintiff’s pay and work assignments, thus increasing the\n\nstatements’ ability to “alter the conditions of the victim’s\n\nemployment.”      Harris, 510 U.S. at 21.                  By contrast, in the case\n\nat hand, (1) there was only one incident involving one alleged\n\nharasser;      (2) the     alleged        harasser         was     perceived          by    the\n\nplaintiff to be a “glorified hostess” with no “power to . . .\n\nmake decisions”; and (3) although the alleged harasser denied\n\n                                           91\n\fmaking the offensive statement, the employer promptly issued her\n\na   written     reprimand,        warning      her    “to     be   cautious   [that]     the\n\nlanguage or phrases [that] she uses can not [sic] be perceived\n\nas racist or derogatory.”\n\n        For   the   reasons       given,    Clubb’s         alleged   use   of    the   term\n\n“porch monkey” twice in less than 24 hours when talking about a\n\nsingle incident was not, as a matter of law, sufficiently severe\n\nor pervasive to create a racially hostile work environment that\n\naltered the terms and conditions of Liberto’s employment.

Specifically,        in\n\nBreeden, 532 U.S. at 270, the Court declined “to rule on the\n\npropriety of [the Ninth Circuit’s] interpretation” of § 2000e-\n\n3(a)     as    “protect[ing]         employee       ‘oppos[ition]’           not    just     to\n\npractices that are actually ‘made . . . unlawful’ by Title VII,\n\nbut also to practices that the employee could reasonably believe\n\nwere unlawful,” “because even assuming [that its interpretation]\n\nis correct, no one could reasonably believe that the incident\n\n                                             94\n\f[at issue] violated Title VII.”                   Finally, we have gone one step\n\nfurther,      recognizing          that     an    employee      is     protected         from\n\nretaliation      if,    at    the    time    of    her   complaint,       she      had    “an\n\nobjectively reasonable belief in light of all the circumstances\n\nthat a Title VII violation has happened or is in progress.”\n\nJordan, 458 F.3d at 341 (emphasis added).\n\n      Under     the    Jordan      standard,      when   an    employee’s       complaint\n\nrelates    to    another      employee’s         harassing     conduct,       we   do    not\n\nrequire    the    harassment         to   have     already     risen    to    the    level\n\nactionable under Title VII in order for her opposition activity\n\nto   be   protected         from    retaliation.         But    when    the     offending\n\nconduct has not risen to the level of a practice made unlawful\n\nby Title VII, we also recognized that it would be inappropriate\n\nto   “simply     assume,       without      more,    that      the   opposed       conduct\n\n[would] continue or [would] be repeated unabated.”                           Jordan, 458\n\nF.3d at 341.          Instead, we held that in this incipient stage, a\n\nplaintiff must be able to point to evidence that “reasonably\n\nsupports the inference” that the conduct being objected to was\n\n“likely to recur at a level sufficient to create a hostile work\n\nenvironment.”         Id.     In other words, for an employee’s report of\n\nobjectionable conduct that has not yet become unlawful under\n\nTitle VII to qualify as protected activity, the employee must,\n\nat the very least, have an objectively reasonable belief that a\n\n\n\n                                             95\n\fhostile work environment would result, “based on circumstances\n\nthat the employee observes and reasonably believes.”                        Id.\n\n       Here, the majority adopts a standard far beyond that which\n\nwe recognized in Jordan and far beyond what any court of appeals\n\nhas recognized.             It holds that an employee’s single complaint\n\nabout a single incident, regardless of whether the incident is\n\nactually         unlawful    under    Title     VII    or   whether        the    employee\n\nreasonably believes that the incident is likely to recur, can be\n\nthe basis for a legitimate retaliation claim, so long as the\n\nconduct is humiliating.              See ante, at 43-45.            This new standard\n\nwill surely generate many new questions about which offensive\n\nworkplace comments are objectively humiliating and lead to an\n\nexpansion of litigation far beyond Title VII’s design.\n\n       I    would    conclude    in     this    case   that    the    district       court\n\ncorrectly         entered     summary    judgment       for    the     defendants      on\n\nLiberto’s retaliation claim because, as a matter of law, she did\n\nnot oppose activity that Title VII protects from retaliation\n\nwhen       she    reported    Clubb’s     conduct      to     the    Clarion’s      Human\n\nResources Director.            In light of all the circumstances, Clubb’s\n\nuse of an offensive racial epithet twice in less than 24 hours\n\nwas    insufficiently          severe    to     give    Liberto       an    objectively\n\nreasonable belief that she was complaining about the presence of\n\na racially hostile work environment, rather than simply about\n\nanother      employee’s      inappropriate       conduct.       Certainly,         Liberto\n\n                                           96\n\fcould have reasonably concluded from Clubb’s demeaning statement\n\nthat Clubb herself was a racist.                       But the fact that a single\n\nemployee has revealed herself through an isolated incident to be\n\nbigoted does not translate into an objectively reasonable belief\n\nthat    the    workplace         itself       has    become      abusive   to    employees\n\nbecause of their race.

Liberto has not identified any evidence in the\n\nrecord   suggesting         that       workplace      racism      was   afoot    prior      to\n\nClubb’s statements, nor any evidence suggesting that she had\n\nreason   to    believe       that      her    supervisors        and    co-workers    would\n\ntolerate such conduct or permit it to recur.                               Indeed, after\n\nLiberto reported the incident, the Clarion’s management promptly\n\nissued a written reprimand to Clubb, warning her to be cautious\n\nabout her language.\n\n                                               97\n\f         While Liberto had every right to be offended by Clubb’s use\n\nof   a    racial   epithet    and    acted    reasonably   and    responsibly   in\n\nreporting the incident to Clarion’s Human Resources Director,\n\nshe lacked a reasonable belief, as required by the language of\n\nTitle VII, that she was opposing her employer’s commission of\n\n“a[]       practice    made . . . unlawful . . . by              [Title    VII].”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).          For that reason, I would conclude, as a\n\nmatter of law, that she did not engage in protected activity and\n\nthat     the   district      court   therefore     properly      entered   summary\n\njudgment against her on her retaliation claims.\n\n\n                                         B\n\n         In addition to adopting a broad and unprecedented standard\n\nfor evaluating retaliation claims under Title VII, the majority\n\nalso gratuitously reverses a portion of Jordan in a manner by\n\nwhich Judge King, the majority’s author, explicitly vindicates\n\nhis dissent in Jordan, notwithstanding his concession that this\n\ncase presents distinguishing circumstances.\n\n         Notably, the majority does not overturn all of Jordan.                 It\n\nin no way suggests, for example, that the isolated incident at\n\nissue in that case was sufficiently severe to create a hostile\n\nwork environment.         Indeed, by “oberserv[ing] that the district\n\ncourt improperly analogized this matter . . . to Jordan,” the\n\nmajority instead confirms that “a racist remark that was made by\n\n\n                                         98\n\fa mere co-worker and not aimed at [the plaintiff] or any other\n\nemployee” does not amount to a hostile work environment.                           Ante,\n\nat 35.       Nor does the majority indicate that the plaintiff in\n\nJordan had a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment\n\nwas taking shape at the time he reported his co-worker’s racist\n\ncomment to his supervisors.           Rather, the only portion of Jordan\n\nthat the majority overrules is its already liberalizing rule\n\nthat    a    plaintiff    whose    retaliation        claim     is       based    on   an\n\nobjectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment\n\nwas in progress, but not yet in existence, need only point to\n\nsome evidence indicating that such an environment was “likely to\n\noccur.”      Jordan, 458 F.3d at 340;          see ante, at 38.\n\n       The    majority    claims     that      this   aspect        of    Jordan       “is\n\nincompatible      with    Crawford       [v.

Cleary, nothing\n\nin this holding is “incompatible” with Jordan.                             Ante, at 41.\n\n       Similarly,      the    issue       in    Burlington          Northern     was        whether\n\n“Title       VII’s    antiretaliation               provision       forbids          only    those\n\nemployer      actions       and     resulting         harms     that       are       related    to\n\nemployment or the workplace,” as does the statute’s substantive\n\nantidiscrimination provision.                       548 U.S. at 61.              In answering\n\nthat     question      in    the     negative,          the     Court      emphasized          that\n\nlanguage       in     the     antidiscrimination                provision            “explicitly\n\n                                               100\n\flimit[s]    the      scope    of     that    provision    to    actions      that   affect\n\nemployment or alter the conditions of the workplace,” whereas\n\n“[n]o    such        limiting        words    appear     in    the     antiretaliation\n\nprovision.”          Id. at 62.         The Court further reasoned that the\n\ndifference between the two provisions’ purposes confirms “that\n\nCongress intended the differences that its language suggests.”\n\nId. at 63.        It was on this basis that the Court rejected the\n\nview    that    it    would     be    “‘anomalous’       to    read    the    statute   to\n\nprovide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for\n\nthose whom Title VII primarily seeks to protect, namely, victims\n\nof   race-based,        ethnic-based,         religion-based,         or     gender-based\n\ndiscrimination.”         Id. at 66.            As such, despite the majority’s\n\nsuggestion to the contrary, Burlington Northern does not stand\n\nfor the proposition that courts must always adopt the broadest\n\npossible construction of Title VII’s antiretaliation provision,\n\nand it certainly does not authorize courts to afford plaintiffs\n\nprotection beyond what the statute itself provides.\n\n       At a more general level, the majority faults the Jordan\n\nstandard as being at odds with “the hope and expectation that\n\nemployees will report harassment early, before it rises to the\n\nlevel of a hostile work environment.”                    Ante, at 38.        Along these\n\nlines, the majority suggests that, when combined with the early\n\nreporting      “compelled       by    the    Ellerth/Faragher         defense,”     Jordan\n\nplaces an employee who has experienced an isolated incident of\n\n                                             101\n\fharassment in an untenable position, leaving her vulnerable to\n\nretaliation          if    she     reports          her   supervisor’s        conduct     and\n\ninsulating her employer from liability should she fail to report\n\nit.    Ante, at 39.             The majority’s dilemma, however, is a false\n\none.      First,          the    Ellerth/Faragher         affirmative         defense    only\n\nenables    an    employer          to     avoid       vicarious    liability       for    its\n\nsupervisor’s         creation      of     a    hostile     work    environment      if    the\n\nemployer can prove both that it “exercised reasonable care to\n\nprevent and correct promptly any . . . harassing behavior, and\n\n. . . that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take\n\nadvantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided\n\nby the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.”                            Ellerth, 524 U.S.\n\nat 765 (emphasis added); see also Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807.                              It\n\nis highly doubtful, however, that an employer would be able to\n\nshow   that     an    employee      acted       unreasonably       by   choosing    not    to\n\nimmediately report an isolated incident of workplace misconduct\n\nthat was not in itself sufficient to give rise to a reasonable\n\nbelief that a hostile work environment was in progress.                                   Cf.\n\nMatvia v. Bald Head Island Mgmt., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774282\"><a href=\"/opinion/774282/christina-matvia-v-bald-head-island-management-incorporated-and-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 270 (4th\n\nCir.   2001)     (holding          that       the    employer     had    established      the\n\naffirmative defense because, “[i]n light of th[e] long-term and\n\npersistent harassment, [the plaintiff] cannot be excused from\n\nfailing to report [her supervisor’s conduct]” sooner (emphasis\n\nadded)).         Second,          the     majority        combines      the    qualitative\n\n                                                102\n\frequirement of objective reasonableness in reporting harassment\n\nwith    the    laches    concept        described    by    the    Supreme      Court    in\n\nFaragher,      524    U.S.   at    807,    and     developed      by    this   court    in\n\nMatvia, 259 F.3d at 270, in order to invent a fictitious Catch-\n\n22.      In     actuality,    an    employee        only    risks       retaliation     by\n\nreporting too early when there is insufficient conduct about\n\nwhich to complain under Title VII, and she only risks dismissal\n\nof her claim for reporting too late when she inordinately delays\n\ncoming forward.\n\n       More to the point, however, it is not the role of this\n\ncourt     to    incentivize       the     early     reporting      of     objectionable\n\nconduct       where   Congress     itself     has    not    seen       fit   to   do   so.\n\nIndeed, Congress could have written Title VII’s antiretaliation\n\nprovision to provide protection to every employee who reports\n\nany offensive, racially or sexually charged workplace incident\n\nthat makes him or her uncomfortable.                       But it did not.             See,\n\ne.g., Breeden, 532 U.S. at 269-71 (holding that an employee did\n\nnot    engage    in    protected        activity    when    she     complained     that,\n\nduring a meeting, her supervisor read aloud a sexually explicit\n\nstatement, which a job applicant had purportedly made, before\n\nlooking at her and stating, “I don’t know what that means,” and\n\nthen chuckling along with a male employee who offered to explain\n\nthe comment to him later).                Instead, Congress chose to protect\n\nonly employees who have “opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\n                                           103\n\femployment practice by [Title VII].”                       42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\nWe have already liberally interpreted this provision to protect\n\nemployees who possess an objectively reasonable belief that they\n\nare complaining about a Title VII violation that has occurred or\n\nis in progress, a standard that serves to protect employees in\n\nclose   cases.         But    we    cannot        simply   presume       that    a    single\n\nincident     of    racially          charged           workplace     misconduct        will\n\ninevitably      ripen        into     an     actual        racially       hostile       work\n\nenvironment,       lest       our         interpretation           become       completely\n\nuntethered from Title VII’s text.                       Instead, a plaintiff whose\n\nretaliation claim is based on an objectively reasonable belief\n\nthat she was opposing a hostile work environment that was in the\n\nprocess of developing must be able to point to some evidence\n\nthat supports the inference that such an environment was “likely\n\nto occur.”      Jordan, 458 F.3d at 340 (emphasis added).\n\n      Instead     of     requiring          the     plaintiff       to    produce       such\n\nevidence, the majority concludes that opposing an incident that\n\nis humiliating, regardless of whether it could lead to a hostile\n\nwork environment, is protected.                   Ante, at 44-45.        Even a cursory\n\nconsideration      of    this       new    per     se    rule   quickly     reveals     its\n\nproblems.    An isolated incident of humiliating harassment is, of\n\ncourse, more serious than “a mere offensive utterance.”                              Harris,\n\n510 U.S. at 23.         But it is far from clear why a single incident\n\nof   humiliating       harassment         that    is    insufficient      to    support   a\n\n                                            104\n\freasonable belief that a hostile work environment had come into\n\nexistence would nonetheless give rise to a reasonable belief\n\nthat    a   hostile       work       environment        was    in   the       process       of\n\ndeveloping.         The majority must be assuming that, if a single\n\ninstance      of      humiliating          harassment         has       occurred,       then\n\nobjectionable        conduct      is   bound      to    be    repeated       at    a   level\n\nsufficient to create a hostile work environment.                             But this, of\n\ncourse,     does    not   follow.          And    I    can    anticipate      much     hand-\n\nwringing     in    the    legal      community        when    determining         whether   a\n\nparticular        incident     qualifies      as      humiliating       or    whether       it\n\nremains merely an offensive utterance.\n\n       The majority’s position is also entirely pessimistic about\n\nthe ability and desire of employers to stop the progression from\n\nisolated     utterances         of     racial         slurs    to   a     hostile       work\n\nenvironment.          Indeed,        the   majority       manifests      a    fundamental\n\ndistrust of employers, assuming that, once a humiliating epithet\n\nis uttered, the development of a hostile work environment is a\n\nfait accompli -- in other words, that employers are powerless or\n\nunwilling to prevent a descent into pervasive hostility.                                This\n\nassumption, of course, finds no more support in Title VII or\n\nSupreme Court precedent than it does in basic logic.                                What is\n\nmore, even the most conscientious employer will now be reluctant\n\nto fire an objectively underperforming employee who has reported\n\na racial epithet that could be considered humiliating because,\n\n                                            105\n\funder   the     majority’s        standard,       that    employee     is       effectively\n\npresumed to have reasonably believed that he was protesting an\n\nunlawful employment practice when he made his complaint.                                This\n\npresumption      is    at   odds    with    Title        VII,   the   Supreme        Court’s\n\njurisprudence,        and   the     fundamental      character        of    employers      in\n\nAmerica’s modern workplace.\n\n\n                                            IV\n\n       At bottom, I would conclude, as did the district court,\n\nthat    while     Clubb’s      comments         to   Liberto      were         unacceptably\n\noffensive,      they    were       made    in     connection      with         an   isolated\n\nincident, and therefore they were insufficient to demonstrate\n\nthe existence of a hostile work environment that altered the\n\nterms   and     conditions     of    Liberto’s       employment.           I    would   also\n\nconclude, as did the district court, that because Title VII’s\n\nantiretaliation        provision          requires,       as    we    have          liberally\n\nconstrued it, that an employee’s opposition must be to a hostile\n\nwork environment that she reasonably believed was in progress,\n\nLiberto’s retaliation claims also fail.                    Thus, I would affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                            106\n\f</pre>",
