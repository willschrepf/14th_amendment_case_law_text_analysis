INTRODUCTION\n        This case involves four victims: Antonio Centron, Luis Perez, Lisa Thayer and\nRico McIntosh. Defendant Javier Gomez was found guilty of the second degree murder\nof McIntosh and the jury found true enhancements for participating in a criminal street\ngang and intentionally discharging a firearm causing bodily injury or death. A second\njury found defendants Mota and Elizalde1, guilty of the first degree murder of Centron,\nPerez and McIntosh and came back with an acquittal as to Lisa Thayer. The jury also\nfound Mota and Elizalde guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, participating in a\ncriminal street gang and found true enhancements for participating in a criminal street\ngang. As to Mota, the jury found true an enhancement for intentionally discharging a\nfirearm causing great bodily injury or death. Elizalde was also found guilty of dissuading\na witness by force or threat of force.\n\n        1\n        Because Gomez confessed to one of the murders and implicated Mota, the court\nordered a single trial with two juries: one jury for Gomez and the second jury for Mota\nand Elizalde.\n\n\n                                                         1\n\f         On appeal, Gomez argues that (1) the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct\nthe jury that an unforeseeable supervening cause might have caused Rico McIntosh’s\ndeath (Elizalde and Mota join in this argument); (2) the trial court did not properly\nanswer the jury’s questions regarding the elements of second degree murder (Elizalde\njoins in this argument); (3) the trial court erred in permitting testimony regarding threats\nto witnesses (Elizalde and Mota join in this argument); and (4) the trial court erred when\nit failed to instruct the jury that witness Oscar Menendez was an accomplice as a matter\nof law (Elizalde and Mota join in this argument).\n         Mota argues that the trial court erred when it (1) found that there was no prima\nfacie case of discrimination with regard to an African-American prospective juror\n(Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); (2) gave the jury the task of determining\nwhether four witnesses were accomplices (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); (3)\nadmitted into evidence a statement Mota made during booking regarding his gang\naffiliation (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); (4) instructed the jury not to\nspeculate about why unjoined perpetrators were not tried in the same trial (Gomez and\nElizalde join in this argument); and (5) admitted evidence that Mota attacked Jorge\nSanchez in jail (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument). He also argues that (6)\nduring his rebuttal to the defense’s closing argument, the prosecutor committed\nmisconduct (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); and (7) there was cumulative\nerror.\n         Elizalde contends on appeal that (1) there is not substantial evidence to support the\njury’s conspiracy finding (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); (2) the trial court\nfailed in admitting phone calls between Hector Molina and his mother under the co-\nconspirator exception to the hearsay rule (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); (3)\ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek redaction of a statement Elizalde made to\nMolina’s mother during one of these jail calls; (4) the trial court erred when it instructed\nthe jury, pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.13, that the required corroboration of the testimony of\nan accomplice may not be supplied by the testimony of any other accomplice (Gomez\nand Mota join in this argument); (5) the trial court erred when it admitted evidence that\n\n\n                                               2\n\fElizalde possessed methamphetamine for sale to prove a predicate offense for the gang\ncharge and enhancements (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); (6) counsel was\nineffective for failing to object to other crimes evidence regarding the conspiracy to\ncommit murders (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); and (7) there was cumulative\nerror.\n         With the exception of the admission of Mota’s un-Mirandized2 statements made\nwhen he was booked into jail, an error that was not prejudicial, we find no other error and\naffirm the judgments.\n                   II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.       The Murders\n         Defendants Mota and Elizalde were convicted of three murders that occurred over\na four-month period between December 22, 2007, and April 25, 2008. Gomez was\nconvicted of one of the three, that of Rico McIntosh. The most significant testimony\nregarding these murders came from fellow gang members and/or friends, Jorge Sanchez\n(Centron murder), Victor Cervantes (Centron murder), Oscar Menendez (McIntosh\nmurder), and Larry Valencia (Perez murder).\n         1.       Antonio Centron Murder\n         Jorge Sanchez testified that in exchange for his testimony he pled to accessory\nafter the fact to murder, and received a three-year suspended sentence. Sanchez, who\nwas not in the country legally, also had a “parole in place” arrangement with Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement and, as a result, wore an ankle bracelet monitor. Sanchez\ntestified that he was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco3, a subset of the Sureño gang,\nwhich is active in Contra Costa County.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n             Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436 (Miranda).\n         3\n          As one of the prosecution witnesses explained, Varrio Frontero Loco “just stands\nfor it’s a hood, you know, no matter from where country you are from, you are in the\nhood.”\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       The evening of December 22, 2007, Francisco Romero , who was also a Varrio\nFrontero Loco, gathered together a number of people and went to North Richmond.4\nWhen he arrived, Molina phoned defendant Gamaliel (Gama) Elizalde5 “because\nsupposedly he was going to put a meeting to go up there, just fight them [the Richmond\nSur Trace members].” After speaking to Romero, Elizalde came to North Richmond.\nElizalde then tried to call a Richmond Sur Trace member in order to arrange a fight but\nwas not able to reach anyone.\n       After the failed effort to engage the Richmond Sur Trace, Sanchez, Romero and\nMolina eventually drove to the Broadway area of San Pablo, which was known to be\nNorteño territory. Sanchez understood that if they found Norteños there they would beat\nthem up or shoot them. He understood this “was part of the deal of being a . . . [Varrio\nFrontero Loco] Sureño at this time.”\n       That same evening, the victim, Antonio Centron, along with two friends, Neil\nWixson and Adrian Espinoza, attended a party in the Broadway area of San Pablo. They\nstayed at the party for a couple of hours and then walked down Lake Street, toward 19th\nStreet to buy beer. This area of San Pablo was a stronghold of the Norteño gang.\nWixson and Centron wore red shirts, a color associated with Norteños. Centron walked a\nlittle ahead of his friends.\n       Romero drove by Centron, Wixson and Espinoza. Molina, who was in the right\nfront passenger seat, told Romero he knew one of the three men. Molina pulled out a\nhandgun and directed Romero to park down the next street. Romero parked and Molina\nran out, and hid behind a fence, waiting for Centron, Wixson and Espinoza to come to the\ncorner. When they did, Molina told them he was “VFL” and emptied his gun in their\n\n       4\n        Preceding this gathering, there had been altercations between members of Varrio\nFrontero Loco and another Sureño gang called Richmond Sur Trace as well as with rival\nNorteño gang members.\n       5\n         We identify the witnesses, victims, defendants and other participants in this trial\nby their full names rather than their gang nicknames. Where necessary for clarification,\nwe will indicate the full name of any person identified in testimony solely by his gang\nnickname.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fdirection. His first shot hit Centron in the head. Centron died almost immediately. Nine\nmore shots hit Espinoza in the back. Molina’s final shot hit Wixon in the arm. Espinoza,\nwho was still conscious (and ultimately survived his injuries) called 911.\n       After killing and wounding the men he believed were rival gang members, Molina\nran back to the car and they sped off. In the car, Molina was jumpy and excited.\nAccording to Sanchez, Molina said “to watch the newspaper. That’s—that was going to\nbe his trophy.” A newspaper article about a killing was “[l]ike a signature that you did\nit.” The killing would give Molina “more respect” in the gang. Molina called Elizalde to\ntell him what he’d done. Elizalde arrived “and just started telling him just be quiet, stop,\nyou know, screaming and just lay low.”\n       The next day, the police detained and searched Molina. They found in his\npossession a .45 caliber chrome Colt semiautomatic handgun, a blue bandana, and a blue\nbaseball hat. The police arrested him and charged him with possession of a concealed\nfirearm. Molina was released from jail four days later.\n       Victor Cervantes testified that right after Molina got out of jail, he called\nCervantes and asked for a ride home. Molina told him that he’d killed one man and\nanother was in a coma. He also told Cervantes that he’d been with Francisco Romero\nwhen he’d killed the man. Cervantes asked him how he got out of jail when he’d been\ncaught with a gun. Molina told him that he got caught with a different gun than the one\nused in the killing and, as a result, he had gotten away with murder.\n       In an interview with the police, Luis Ruelas testified that Molina admitted to him\nthat he was in the car with Romero and Sanchez that evening and that Molina said he had\nshot at three men and killed one of them.\n       Defendants Elizalde and Mota were found guilty of Centron’s murder as co-\nconspirators.\n       2.       Luis Perez Murder\n       Larry Valencia was one of the prosecution’s main witnesses with regard to the\nmurder of Luis Perez. Valencia had not made a plea bargain with the District Attorney’s\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\foffice, nor was he receiving any witness protection or money from the District Attorney’s\noffice.\n          Valencia testified that late on the night of February 16, 2008, he decided to visit\nfriends in North Richmond. After an evening of drinking beer, smoking marijuana and\ntaking Ecstasy someone said, “[l]et’s jump for a ride. Let’s go find some females to\nparty.” Hector Molina, Jorge Camacho, and Jose Mota got into Mota’s black, two-door\nKia. Molina sat in the driver’s seat, with Jorge Camacho next to him in the passenger\nseat and Mota in the back. Cole Azamar and Luii Hernandez got into Azamar’s car, with\nAzamar driving and Hernandez sitting in the passenger seat. All five men were members\nof Varrio Frontero Loco. They encouraged Larry Valencia (who testified that he was not\na gang member) to join them and he got into the back seat of Azamar’s car. After the two\ncars drove around for a while, with Azamar following Molina, they arrived in San Pablo.\nValencia was aware that this was Norteño territory.\n          Molina stopped the car and Valencia saw the people in Mota’s car arguing with a\nman in a red jacket—the victim, Luis Perez—who was standing next to the car. He saw\nCamacho get out of the car and say to the man, “[s]how me your hands, show me your\nhands.” The man yelled “[w]hat the fuck is going on?” Valencia heard three loud shots\nand saw Camacho shoot the man three or four times. In fact, Camacho hit Perez seven\ntimes: two bullets to the abdomen, two to the back and three to the back of his arms. The\nbullets passed through Perez’s lungs, heart and liver. Perez died en route to John Muir\nHospital in Walnut Creek.\n          Camacho got back into the car with Molina and Mota and Molina drove away.\nValencia had never seen anyone killed before. Valencia told Azamar to take him back to\nhis car so he could go home.\n          Mota was found guilty of Perez’s murder on an aider and abettor theory. Elizalde\nwas found guilty as a co-conspirator.\n          3.     Lisa Thayer\n          The third victim, Lisa Thayer, died when Jorge Camacho, a member of Varrio\nFrontero Loco, exchanged shots with several unidentified men in a Toyota minivan.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       This altercation began late in the afternoon of February 27, 2008. Camacho and\nhis friend Antonio Solomon, were walking on San Pablo Avenue in San Pablo.6 Solomon\nwas wearing a New York Yankees hat. In that area, that kind of hat was understood to\nstand for “Young Narfer,” a reference to North Richmond, which was Sureño territory.\n       A burgundy Toyota minivan with a Hispanic driver and front seat passenger and\nAfrican-American passenger in the back seat passed Solomon and Camacho. Solomon\nand Camacho ran.\n       The men in the minivan chased them. Eventually, the minivan pulled up behind\nSolomon and Camacho. The side door opened, revealing that the back seat passenger had\na gun. Camacho shot at the van with the same 9 mm semiautomatic handgun he used to\nkill Perez. He fired nine times. The man in the van also fired a .40 caliber semiautomatic\nhandgun several times.\n       Lisa Thayer, who was walking on San Pablo about half a block from the shooting,\nwas hit by a bullet. The bullet hit her in the back, went through her right lung and came\nout at her chest. Thayer died soon afterwards.\n       Solomon and Camacho ran from the scene with the van following them. Someone\nin the van fired several more shots at them. Soloman and Camacho climbed a fence and\nran to the apartment of a friend—Ignacio Mendoza. When Mendoza’s mother told them\nto leave, Camacho gave his gun to Mendoza and left with Solomon. The police arrived\nnearby, a witness pointed them out and they were arrested. Camacho had a blue bandana\nin his pocket.\n       The jury found defendants Mota and Elizalde not guilty of Thayer’s murder.\n       4.        Rico McIntosh\n       The fourth shooting occurred in the early morning hours of April 26, 2008. Oscar\nMenendez, who was present at the shooting, testified that he had pleaded to accessory to\nthe murder of McIntosh with a gang enhancement. He was given three years probation.\n\n\n       6\n      Much of the evidence regarding this incident came from an interview between\nSolomon and the police.\n\n\n                                            7\n\fAs a condition of his plea, he agreed to testify in court. At the time he testified he was in\n“parole in place,” which meant he wore an ankle monitor required by Immigrations,\nCustoms and Enforcement. The People were assisting him in obtaining a work permit.\nMenendez had not violated any of the terms of his probation or the terms and conditions\nimposed by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement. He did not receive any money from\nthe District Attorney’s office.\n       Menendez testified that he had known Mota for several years. Mota was a\nmember of Varrio Frontero Loco. Menendez also knew Javier Gomez. The three of\nthem hung out together and “sometimes we used to get in the car and just cruise around.”\nGomez belonged to a Sureño subset called Mexican Loco.7 Menendez had been at\nparties where members of the two Sureño subsets would brag “about crimes they have\ndone during the week or, you know, any stuff that they doing, you know, like beating\nsomebody up or robbing people or whatever crimes they do, they used to brag about all\nof the time.” Six months before the McIntosh murder, Menendez became a Sureño.\n       Menendez described an incident that occurred about a week and a half before the\nMcIntosh murder. He, Gomez and Mota went to visit Gomez’s cousin who lived in\nMontalvin, which was Norteño territory. Mota drove his Kia, and Gomez sat in the front\npassenger seat. Menendez sat in the back. The cousin wasn’t home, so they turned\naround to return to Richmond. As they did so, Gomez and Mota saw a man wearing red\nwho was fixing his car. Mota and Gomez “said he was a Buster. He was wearing\nred . . . .” Menendez didn’t agree and when he saw that Gomez and Mota had a gun8 in\nthe front seat he told them to drop the gun. Menendez tried to grab the gun and in the\nensuing scuffle, someone shot Menendez in the leg.\n\n\n       7\n        During a search of Gomez’s home, the police collected evidence of Gomez’s\ngang membership—four CD cases with “Sureño-type titles on them,” “six individual CDs\nwith Sureño-type titles,” “[a]nother CD . . . again, with Sureño-type titles,” “[t]wo blue\nbandanas.”\n       8\n         Menendez had found this gun earlier, but he gave it to Mota when Mota told him\nthat he (Menendez) couldn’t shoot it and “might as well just give it to him . . . .”\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       Menendez was bleeding heavily, so Mota and Gomez took him to the hospital.\nThe police questioned Menendez and he lied and told them that they had been jumped\nand he had been shot in the leg because he told his assailants that he didn’t have any\nmoney.\n       Several weeks later, Gomez and Mota pulled up to where Menendez was hanging\nout with some friends and “they were calling me, right, and I went to the car and they say\nget in the car. I was like where are you guys going? They said don’t trip.” As on the\nother occasion, Mota was driving and Gomez was in the front passenger seat. Menendez\nasked if his friend could go too, and Mota told him he couldn’t. Menendez got in the car\nand they decided to go to a McDonald’s on San Pablo near Broadway. Instead of turning\nright into the McDonald’s, however, Mota turned left onto Broadway. Menendez asked\nMota were he was going and he said “don’t trip.” Mota kept driving. At this point, they\nwere driving into Norteño territory and Menendez thought “they were looking for some\nNorteños . . . or they were trying to do something again.”\n       Gomez spotted three men wearing red at a stop sign. Mota stopped the car and\nasked the men if they were “busters.” The men said they weren't, and Menendez\nrecognized one of them and told Mota that “they don’t bang . . . .” Mota drove away but\n“he kept on mugging9 them.”\n       Mota then spotted Rico McIntosh, who looked, to Menendez, like he was wearing\na red bandana and had some “red on his pants, too.” Mota and Gomez thought he looked\nlike a Norteño. They pulled alongside McIntosh and Gomez asked him “if he is a\nbuster.” McIntosh said “what the fuck is a buster?” Menendez thought he heard Mota\nsay “pull it out.” He then saw Gomez reach down toward his leg. McIntosh made a\ngesture as though to reach for something and Menendez thought it was a gun. Gomez\nbegan to fire the gun out of the window of the car. Menendez heard four or five shots.\nMcIntosh fell and Mota and Gomez began to laugh. Menendez told them it wasn't funny\nand they told him he was a “pussy.” Menendez said he wanted to go home. “I told them\n\n       9\n           Menendez defined “mugging” as “like he look hellabad at him.”\n\n\n                                             9\n\fwhat they just did, it was wrong because I never seen somebody kill another person like\nthat.”\n         Mota and Gomez “seemed pretty happy, like they just won the lottery or\nsomething. They were really excited about it.” Mota and Gomez wanted to celebrate,\nbut Menendez asked to go home. On the way, Mota and Gomez talked and said, “Oh,\nyou know, what the homies are going to say when they find out, or was he good, was he\nbad, you know they were saying that it was like, you know, it was like perfect. Perfect is\nno one sees them. [¶] No one seen us when we were there. When that happened there\nwas no people at all, just that guy.”\n         When they arrived at Menendez’s house, Mota left the gun with Menendez. He\ntold Menendez that he was on parole and couldn’t have it.\n         A week or so later, Menendez went to a party with members of Varrio Frontero\nLoco and Mexican Loco. At the party, Gomez “started talking about it.” Ruelas was also\npresent, along with a number of other Varrio Frontero Loco and Mexican Loco. Mota\nwas also there.\n         Gomez confessed to the McIntosh murder. He told the police that Mota picked\nhim up the night of the murder and the two of them went to look for Norteños. Mota\ngave him the gun he used to shoot Rico McIntosh. Mota’s job was to drive until he saw a\nNorteño and then stop. Gomez didn’t plan to shoot anyone who wasn’t a Norteño. After\ndriving around for a while Mota and Gomez picked up Menendez. Menendez sat in the\nback seat. They continued to look for Norteños, slowing down to look and then ruling\nout a number of groups of people who were out that night. Eventually, either Mota or\nMenendez spotted McIntosh, who was walking down the street. Mota told him that\nMcIntosh had some red on. Gomez “asked him, are you a Buster? And he said, what the\nfuck is a buster? He, he had a hoodie. Then he like, he pulled the hoodie down as if he\nwanted to do something, so I just shot him.” He shot McIntosh until there were no\nbullets left in his gun.\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       After the shooting they went to a store and bought some beer and drank it at the\ncemetery. He gave the gun to Menendez. Menendez saw the whole thing from the\nbackseat.\n       McIntosh was hit in the hip and buttocks. He was taken to John Muir Hospital and\nreleased on April 28, 2008. The next day, McIntosh collapsed and died after blood clots\ncaused by the gunshot wounds traveled to his lungs.\n       Gomez was convicted of second degree murder. Mota was convicted of first\ndegree murder as an aider and abettor and Elizalde was convicted as a co-conspirator.\nB.     Conspiracy and Gang Evidence\n       Several witnesses testified to a conspiracy on the part of Mota and Elizalde to\ncommit murders of rival Norteño gang members in order to restore the reputation and\nfortunes of the Varrio Frontero Loco.\n       1.     Jorge Sanchez\n       Jorge Sanchez was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco.10 He joined because his\nolder brother was in the gang. Sanchez’s brother was a member of the Mexican Loco,\nanother Sureño gang, and he joined the Varrio Frontero Loco because he wanted his own\n“name.” He was “jumped in” to Varrio Frontero Loco, through a process he described as\n“[j]ust imagine three guys beating on one person, kicking him, beating him, just\nthumping on him” for 13 seconds. He had also helped jump people into the gang.\nSanchez showed the jury a number of tattoos that signified his membership in Varrio\nFrontero Loco. Gang tattoos were important so people “won’t mess with us.”\n       A Sureño who wanted to prove himself would “[j]ust go to the streets. Beat up\nany Norteño you can think of to start with. . . . [¶] Just you earn respect and your stripes.\nStart shooting or just doing whatever you want.” You would do this with other people\n“[t]o make sure you do it. Just to make sure you ain’t lying about what you did.” When\n\n       10\n         Of the witnesses who provided significant testimony regarding the workings of\nthe Varrio Frontero Loco and Elizalde and Mota’s positions and participation in the gang,\nSanchez was the only one the court concluded was an accomplice as a matter of law.\nAccordingly, the jury was instructed to view his testimony with caution.\n\n\n                                              11\n\fSanchez went out to attack Norteños, he would take fellow Varrio Frontero Loco with\nhim. He would do that for “backup.” He would also do it to “make sure they do it, too.\nMake sure they look at you.”\n       Sanchez understood that at the time of trial, Mota and Elizalde had “green lighted”\nhim; that is, they had ordered him killed for talking to the police. Green lighting did not\noccur until the actual text of a statement made to the police was distributed “to the\nstreets,” generally through a defendant who received the statement from his lawyer.\n       Sureños were enemies with Norteños because they were “mixed people”: “part\nMexican . . . they mix with Mexican black, Mexican white.” You could tell who they\nwere by “[t]he hair, the clothes, the grill that is like the gold teeth they wear. [¶] And if\nthey got tattoos you look at tattoos, belts.” In particular, Norteños had long hair, “all of\nthe new clothes the black people be coming out with,” and wore the color red, including\nred belts. Sureños identified themselves with blue bandanas and blue belts.\n       Sanchez was familiar with a number of Norteño sub-gangs including West Side\nBerkeley, Montalvin, Varrio San Pablo. Each of them claimed a particular area. Varrio\nSan Pablo claimed the area near Broadway and the Hilltop Mall.\n       As a Sureño, when he saw a Norteño he was supposed to “[t]ake off, just don’t\neven think about it, just hit them up. . . . Just whoop his ass.”\n       Varrio Frontero Loco used violence to scare “[j]ust the people, Norteños\nwhoever—everybody, the blacks, the whites, the Asians.” They did so “[j]ust so they\nwon’t mess with us. . . . [P]eople be picking on people. Sometimes people just look for a\nway out. And just make sure they scared of you instead of you being scared of them.”\n       Fame mattered because it was a way of “representing my hood,” “[j]ust to let\npeople know . . . where you are from.” You did that by “doing a lot of things, shooting,\nselling drugs, getting money, cars, just whoop—whooping people in front of other\npeople.” A Varrio Frontero Loco would “throw it up” by telling someone who they were,\njust make sure they know it. Being feared by rival gang members was a good thing—\n“[y]ou can be walking the streets with no one, no one is trying to hit you up or\nsomething.”\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       Gang members would get together and brag about what they had done in order to\nlet people know that “if they mess with you they will get the same . . . treatment.” He\nwould also get together with other Varrio Frontero Loco and plan future crimes “to get\nrespect or to make people afraid.”\n       With regard to non-gang members, it was important to “let them know that . . . we\ndon’t mess with you and you just don’t mess with us.”\n       Drug sales were a part of being a Varrio Frontero Loco. Sanchez “wasn’t into\nthat,” but he had seen fellow gang member Gamaliel Elizalde selling drugs out of his\nbackyard. He would sometimes give drugs to Mota to sell and Mota would brag about it.\nThe drug sales were run out of Elizalde’s house.\n       Varrio Frontero Loco held meetings to “check in with each other, to make sure\nwhat was going on with each other and just what kind of problems, like people got\nproblems with someone, different rivals or with a Norteño or something.” Sometimes the\nmembers would put money together for people in jail to use for “hygienes like toothpaste,\nsoap, shampoo . . . .” Elizalde was in charge of putting money “on the books” for the\nVarrio Frontero Loco members who were in jail. The meetings were not held often.\nSometimes the meetings would take place at Victor Valencia’s house and sometimes at\nElizalde’s house.\nOccasionally, he and other members would “check,” or beat up, a member who was not\n“putting in work or he ain’t kicking it with us a lot . . . .”\n       At the time Sanchez joined Varrio Frontero Loco in 2005 or 2006, it was led by a\nnumber of men, including Gamaliel Elizalde. Elizalde was an “OG”11 or leader, “the one\nyou look up to. . . . The one[] that you go ask for advice.” One of the benefits of being a\nleader was that he “get to kickback or just don’t do a lot of things no more.” A leader\n\n\n       11\n          Sanchez explained that “OG” meant “[j]ust like an old Cadillac, like an older\nguy, just the one who is like forties, thirties, forties.” You get to be an “OG” by going\n“through a lot . . . . They went through their stages, just like we went through our stages,\nwe going through our stages. . . . [¶] . . . [T]hey know more stuff than we do. They got\nmore opportunities in their brain.”\n\n\n                                               13\n\fwould not “fight somebody or put a lot of work in the streets, shooting, whatever, just get\nto just relax and let the other generation do their work.”\n        A leader would have money from “things going on on the side . . . . [¶] . . . like\nthey were selling drugs . . . .” The leaders would use the “pee wees” or younger members\n“to distribute it. . . .”\n        In 2007, there were several subsets of Sureños with whom Sanchez was familiar:\nhis own gang, Varrio Frontero Loco, another gang called Mexican Loco and a third called\nRichmond Sur Trece. Although they were all Sureños, they did not always get along. In\n2007, a Varrio Frontero Loco leader called “Toby” shot a member of a Richmond Sur\nTrece and fled, along with his brothers, to avoid being killed in retaliation for murdering\na fellow Sureño. This left a void in the leadership of Varrio Frontero Loco, which was\nfilled by Elizalde. As Sanchez put it, after Toby fled, “everybody was just going to\nGama, so that's the only one who we look up to and who was there with us.”\nNevertheless, after Elizalde took over, Varrio Frontero Loco began to dissolve.\n“[E]verybody just try to take it their own way. It was—just disappeared. Some of them\nwent to some other towns. People got scared because they got shot at, who was getting\nstomped on.” At this point, Varrio Frontero Loco were “getting hurt” and “things were\nbad.”\n        Sanchez testified that “we just had to get it back together.” He and others referred\nto this as “bring[ing] the hood back.” To do this, it was necessary to “recruit[] new\npeople and try to do more damage to the Norteños, to the streets.” All of the Varrio\nFrontero Loco wanted to bring the hood back, including Elizalde. In terms of the\nhierarchy of Varrio Frontero Loco, Elizalde was the leader, and Sanchez was directly\nunder him along with Mota, Ruelas, and several others.\n        Elizalde told the Varrio Frontero Loco that they had to “put in more work,” “go to\nthe streets, ride around the streets,” “[m]ake sure they [the Norteños and everybody]\nknow we around, we ain’t gone.” They would do this by “hit[ting] the streets, ride\naround, especially in Norteño territory.” Sanchez explained that this was effective\nbecause the Norteños “don’t expect us to go. They think we going to be scared. They\n\n\n                                              14\n\fthink we going to just lay back. And we go there and they go, oh, man, they coming back\nand they coming back hard.” In Norteño territory, [i]f you see them just shoot them or\nwhoop them, whatever you got. If you don’t got no gun you just get out and do what you\ngot.”\n        Sanchez discussed this plan with all the Varrio Frontero Loco, including Mota.\nHe didn’t talk to Elizalde about why he wanted to bring the hood back; he only knew that\nElizalde “wanted it done.”\n        According to Sanchez, he and Mota, along with Luis Ruelas, Luii Hernandez, and\nCole Azamar were “the ones who was going to bring them back . . . just the ones who got\nto take care of everything.” They covered different parts of Richmond. In addition to\nattacking Norteños, they also recruited and “guided” “pee wees.” Elizalde wanted them\nto “get into the high schools and expand the Sureños and hurt the Norteños.”\n        Shortly before Sanchez was arrested, Mota came to his house. He was nervous\nbecause the police had been to his house. Mota told him that he [Mota] “went in the\nshootout.” He also spoke to Jorge Camacho who told him that he “shot a lady.”\n        2.    Oscar Menendez\n        Oscar Menendez testified that at the time of the Rico McIntosh murder, he “was\nundecided” about being a Varrio Frontero Loco. He “didn’t want it for my future . . . it\nwas just fine being with them, you know, being with girls and having parties, but I didn’t\nlike the rest that they used to do.” He had a lot of Sureño mentions on his MySpace page,\nand he liked being around the gang because it “was fun because they always used to hang\naround with a lot of girls and they always used to have parties every weekend and, you\nknow, beers and music.”\n        He was aware that gang members “hunted and attacked Norteños.” However, no\none ever “told me to do it.” He was never “jumped in.” He associated with the Varrio\nFrontero Loco for six or seven months beginning in November 2007 until his arrest about\na week after the McIntosh murder.\n        It was typical for gang members to brag about their crimes. He explained, “they\nsay that’s what they get respect because when they—when the rest of the guys knew what\n\n\n                                            15\n\fyou were doing they will respect you more than what they do.” This was a “big deal” to\nthe Varrio Frontero Loco.\n       The Norteños were the Varrio Frontero Loco’s rivals. Menendez knew what areas\nwere Norteño territory. He also knew that if a Varrio Frontero Loco found a Norteño or\nsaw one he was to “beat him up and if you have a gun you have to use it.” That is\nbecause the Varrio Frontero Loco “wanted to get rid of Norteños.”\n       He knew both Javier Gomez and Victor Cervantes, both of whom were members\nof the Sureño gang, Mexican Loco. When he associated with these gangs he knew they\ngot along “but not that much” at first.\n       According to Menendez, Varrio Frontero Loco “wasn’t that much organized.” He\n“never knew who was the shot-caller . . . .” He was aware that the members “used to\nreceive orders from some older guys . . . .” When he asked what they were doing, the\nmembers would say “don’t trip . . . that’s something that I got to do and that’s it.” In his\nown mind, he thought that Elizalde was the shot-caller because he once heard him giving\norders to someone. At one point, Elizalde told Menendez that “in order to be a Sureño\nyou have to get down, you now, don’t have to be a fear of anybody, if you see a Norteño\non the street you have to put him on check, beat him up or anything that is in your hands\nto get him away from Richmond, and to don’t let them come to Richmond, let them stay\nin San Pablo.” Specifically Elizalde told him that if he saw a Norteño he was to beat him\nup and if he had a gun to use it. Elizalde once told him that in order to be a Sureño he\nhad to “stick with them all the time and commit sort of a crime that he used to commit—I\nhad to do the crime that they used to do in the week and stick around with them and, you\nknow, do whatever they—they were doing during the week.” This would include\n“[s]tealing cars and robbing people, shooting Norteños, beat them up.” Mota told him the\nsame thing. He also told him that he had to “earn” a Varrio Frontero Loco tattoo by\ndoing something “big” like kill a Norteño.\n       On three occasions, he heard Elizalde instruct someone to beat up a Norteño or to\nlook for him. He also heard Elizalde say that Richmond was Sureño territory.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Menendez named a number of Varrio Frontero Loco as those with the most\nrespect in the gang. They were Molina, Azamar, Camacho, Ruelas and Sanchez. He also\nknew Larry Valencia, who he didn’t think was a gang member.\n       He felt that he had to do what Elizalde told him to do. He did not, however, think\nthat he had to hunt Norteños in San Pablo. When he went with Mota and Javier Gomez\non April 13, 2008, which was the day he shot himself by accident, he did not know that\nthey were looking for Norteños to kill. Nor did he think that was the case on April 26,\n2008. He did not realize that they were looking for Norteños to kill until the car did not\nturn toward the McDonald’s on Broadway as he had expected.\n       In jail, Menendez received a message on the module where he was housed from\nthe Sureño shot caller. The message laid out in detail how he was to behave while\nincarcerated. Among other things, he was to contribute money to buy food and supplies\nfor other Sureños, he was not to speak to the police, he was to follow orders from the shot\ncaller and if he was asked, he was to beat people up the shot caller told him to attack. He\nwas also required to give the shot caller a copy of the police report on his arrest as well as\nany other legal materials in order to permit the shot caller to determine whether he was a\nsnitch. Menendez refused to give these materials to the shot caller and, several days later,\nhe was beat up by several Sureños. He entered protective custody afterwards.\n       3.     Luis Ruelas\n       Luis Ruelas testified that he was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco for six years\nuntil 2008. He was 14 or 15 when he was jumped into the gang. Jose Valencia brought\nhim into the gang.\n       Ruelas’s testimony before the grand jury was admitted into evidence. In that\ntestimony, Ruelas told the grand jury that he had “earned” a tattoo that said “Chap Killa”\non his arm. He worked his way up from the bottom of the gang by earning “respect”\nthrough shooting and beating up Norteños. Norteños were identified by the color red,\nwhile Sureños wore the color blue. Ruelas became close to one of the top people in\nVarrio Frontero Loco at the time, Victor Valencia. Valencia had secured their territory\nby running out another gang that had previously been there.\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       Ruelas was deported to Mexico and Victor Valencia fled the country. When\nRuelas returned, Elizalde “was the main—was the kingpin at that time, but everything\nelse was a mess on the streets.” Elizalde was “moving all the drugs.” With Victor\nValencia gone, “[h]e took over all our stuff.” Ruelas did not like Elizalde. Elizalde gave\norders to kill people, including one occasion when Elizalde told Ruelas to “kill somebody\nbecause they popped his tires.” He didn’t do it because at the time he was working as an\ninformant with the San Pablo police. As part of his deal with the police, he promised not\nto participate in the commission of any crimes. Elizalde also would send Ruelas out to\ncollect debts using violence.\n       On one occasion, before he returned to Richmond, Ruelas spoke to Hector Molina,\nwho told him “We miss you . . . . We bringing the hood back.” According to Ruelas,\n“the whole part of being a Sureño” was to “assault or kill Norteños.”\n       Ruelas’s testimony at an earlier gang prosecution was also admitted into evidence.\nAt that time, Ruelas testified that violence was an important part of bringing the hood\nback “[b]ecause if . . . you don’t have people be scared of you, they ain’t going to respect\nyou. They going to be like, you know, whatever. As long as you show them you really\nabout it, they will think about it twice before they come at you.” Violence also helped\nrecruit new members who “seen what we were doing and they knew we had money. We\nhad girls, we had everything. And they wanted it, too, so they started joining in.”\n       At trial, Ruelas was reluctant to testify because of threats to his family. In general,\nhe either outright denied or claimed to forget testimony he had earlier given about Varrio\nFrontero Loco. At trial, he testified that Varrio Frontero Loco did not have a structure in\nwhich there was a shot caller. Instead, there were people he looked up to, including\nVictor Valencia. Ruelas also had respect for Elizalde because he was his elder.\n       Ruelas showed the jury tattoos on his forearms that said “Chap Killa.” A Chap, he\nexplained, is a Norteño gang member. He had done a lot of crimes to earn the tattoo.\n       One of the rules of being a Sureño “is just you got to represent yourself the right\nway.” To do that, you had to have respect, which you earned through loyalty. If a Varrio\nFrontero Loco saw a Norteño he was expected to get into a fight with the Norteño. He\n\n\n                                             18\n\fwould sometimes go out and look for Norteños to find. The Broadway area in San Pablo\nwas one place the Norteños hung out.\n       He knew Elizalde because they “used to kick it outside his house.” Elizalde was a\nVarrio Frontero Loco. He was older and “some guys came up to him for advice.”\nAlthough he had earlier told the police that Elizalde was “running the streets,” he had\ndone so because “I was just trying to save my life from being prosecuted, but it was—\nwhat I said was wrong . . . .” In general, he retracted a number of statements he made\nearlier in which he had identified Elizalde as the person who had taken over drug sales,\nthe person to whom he would go if he needed a gun quickly, and as having a list of\npeople that needed to be hit. He also did not remember telling the police that Mota\nbrought a pound of methamphetamine to his house along with a gun and said he was\ngoing on a drug deal.\nD.     The Verdicts\n       The Gomez jury deliberated for three days and came back with a second degree\nmurder verdict with regard to Rico McIntosh. It found the firearm and gang\nenhancements true. The trial court sentenced Gomez to an aggregate term of 40 years to\nlife in prison.\n       After four days of deliberation, the Mota/Elizalde jury brought back guilty verdicts\non three murder counts and an acquittal with regard to the death of Lisa Thayer. It also\nfound Mota and Elizalde guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, participating in a\ncriminal street gang and found true enhancements for participating in a criminal street\ngang. As to Mota, the jury found true an enhancement for intentionally discharging a\nfirearm causing great bodily injury or death. Elizalde was also found guilty of dissuading\na witness by force or threat of force. The court sentenced Mota to an aggregate term of\n100 years to life. It sentenced Elizalde to an aggregate term of 103 years to life.\n       This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f                                    III. DISCUSSION\nA.     Unforeseeable Supervening Cause Instruction\n       Rico McIntosh’s death was caused by a pulmonary embolism 72 hours after he\nwas shot and a day after he was released from the hospital. Gomez argues that the trial\ncourt erred because it failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, that they were required to\ndetermine whether actions other than Gomez's—in particular, the decision of his doctors\nto release him from the hospital—constituted an unforeseeable supervening case. He also\ncontends that the instructions the court gave were inadequate. We disagree.\n       a.     Factual Background\n       McIntosh died at around noon on April 29, 2008, after having been released from\nJohn Muir Hospital the morning before. Dr. Ikechi Ogan performed McIntosh’s autopsy.\nOgan examined two bullet wounds; one was located on McIntosh’s right thigh and the\nother on his left hip. Neither was fired from close range. McIntosh had large hematomas\non his thigh and hip where he had been shot. A large blood clot was blocking both of\nMcIntosh’s lungs. Ogan determined that this blood clot, which totally blocked the flow\nof blood, made it impossible for McIntosh to breathe and was the cause of his death. The\nclot was caused by “complications of the gunshot wound to [McIntosh’s] pelvic region”\nand was the cause of his death.\n       Ogan testified that in general a doctor would know that blood clots are “very likely\nwhen you have injury to the lower body and pelvis.” The trial court sustained an\nobjection to defendant’s question about whether the doctors at John Muir should have\n“kept an eye on” McIntosh. Ogan testified that McIntosh’s follow-up care at John Muir\nwas not relevant to his determination of the cause of death: “I have no desire to comment\non . . . why he was released. [¶] My job was to figure out a cause of death of this\ngentleman. And I did that with the information I had. [¶] I had enough information from\nthe investigating officers and the sheriff’s department to do what I had to do and I did\nthat. [¶] That he was released was not . . . in my control. I had a dead body in front of\nme. I had to decide what killed this dead body and I did that.”\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       When asked if the gunshot wounds would have been fatal “but for” the clotting,\nOgan replied as follows: “[T]he best thing that I can say is that I have seen people who\nhave gunshot wounds to an extremity, say a thigh or leg, who died. I have seen people\nwho had a gunshot[] wound to the thigh or leg who didn’t die. Same with the pelvis, it\nall depends on the individual.”\n       b.     Discussion\n       Gomez does not appear to challenge the instructions the court gave the jury on\ncausation. Rather, he argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury sua sponte\nthat if it found that the decision to release McIntosh was the sole cause of his death\n(apparently if it was grossly negligent), then it could not find that Gomez was the cause\nof McIntosh’s death.\n       He is incorrect. The trial court’s duty to instruct the jury sua sponte extends only\nto the general principles of law that are necessary for the jury’s understanding of the case.\n(People v. Mayfield (1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 773.) The court did so by giving the jury the\nfull panoply of instructions on causation.12 Having adequately instructed the jury, the\n\n\n       12\n          The trial court gave the jury several instructions on proximate cause. It\ninstructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.41 as follows: “There may be more than\none cause of death of Rico McIntosh. When the conduct of two or more persons\ncontributes concurrently as a cause of the death, the conduct of each is a cause of the\ndeath if that conduct was also a substantial factor contributing to the result. A cause is\nconcurrent if it was operative at the moment of the death and acted with another cause to\nproduce the death. If you find that a defendant’s conduct was a cause of death to another\nperson, then it is no defense that the conduct of some other person, even the deceased\nperson, contributed to the death. It is not a defense to a criminal charge that the deceased\nor some other person was guilty of negligence, which was a contributory cause of the\ndeath involved in the case. Where the original injury is a cause of the death, the fact that\nthe immediate cause of death was the medical or surgical treatment administered or that\nthe treatment was a factor contributing to the cause of death will not relieve the person\nwho inflicted the original injury from responsibility. Where, however, the original injury\nis not a cause of the death and the death was caused by medical or surgical treatment or\nsome other cause, then the defendant is not guilty of the unlawful homicide [¶] If a\nperson unlawfully inflicts a physical injury upon another person and that injury is a cause\nof the latter’s death, that conduct constitutes an unlawful homicide even though the injury\ninflicted was not the only cause of death. Or, moreover, that conduct constitutes\n\n                                             21\n\ftrial court did not have a duty give clarifying or amplifying instructions unless counsel\nrequested them. (Id. at p. 778.) Nor does defendant argue that the instructions the trial\ncourt gave were either incorrect or misleading.\n         Gomez instead argues that the court should have instructed the jury on the\napplication of these principles of causation to the decision by the hospital to release\nMcIntosh and instructed the jury that if it found that the decision to release McIntosh was\ngrossly improper, they could conclude that this maltreatment was the sole source of\ndeath.\n         We disagree. The court’s sua sponte duty to instruct on general principles of law\ndoes not extend to “pinpoint” instructions. (People v. Saille (1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103,\n1119.) Pinpoint instructions “relate particular facts to a legal issue in the case or\n‘pinpoint’ the crux of a defendant’s case, such as mistaken identification or alibi.\n[Citation.] They are required to be given upon request when there is evidence supportive\nof the theory, but they are not required to be given sua sponte.” (Ibid.) Gomez did not\nrequest such an instruction and the court had no sua sponte duty to give one.\n         Therefore, we conclude that the jury was properly and adequately instructed on the\nprinciples of causation. Nor does defense counsel’s decision not to request such an\ninstruction amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the lack of evidence to\nsupport the defense theory that inadequate medical care was the sole cause of McIntosh's\ndeath, any request for a pinpoint instruction on this issue would have been unavailing.\nMoreover, even if the court had given this pinpoint instruction, the result would not have\nbeen more favorable to Gomez. Ogan determined that the cause of McIntosh's death was\na blood clot that blocked the flow of blood and made it impossible for McIntosh to\nbreathe. The doctor’s testimony that the blood clot was caused by “complications of the\n\nunlawful homicide, even if; [¶] One the person injured had been already weakened by\ndisease, injury, physical condition or other cause; [¶] Or, two, it is probable that a person\nin sound physical condition injured in the same way would not have died from the injury;\n[¶] Or, three, it is probable that the injury only hastened the death of the injured person;\n[¶] Or, four, the injured person would have died soon thereafter from another cause or\nother causes.”\n\n\n                                              22\n\fgunshot wound to [McIntosh’s] pelvic region” established that Gomez’s conduct was a\nsubstantial factor in causing McIntosh’s death. In contrast, there was no evidence to\nsupport the defense theory that the decision to release McIntosh was so grossly negligent\nas to be the sole cause of his death.13\nB.     Jury Question Regarding Second Degree Murder\n       Gomez argues that the trial court erred in its response to a question posed by the\njury during its deliberations. We disagree.\n       During its deliberations, the jury sent out the following note seeking clarification:\n“[R]egarding CALJIC 8.20 [first degree murder] . . . if the act of shooting resulted in a\nmurder and the premeditation was the act of shooting, does this imply a premeditation of\nmurder when murder was the result not the intent?”\n       The court provided the jury with a typewritten response that first addressed the\npremeditation or “intent to kill” element of first degree murder: “Under the\npremeditation and deliberation theory of first degree murder described in CALJIC 8.20\nthe defendant must have express malice that is, a manifest intent to kill, as well as\npremeditation and deliberation before acting.”\n       The court then went on to describe the interplay between the lack of intent to kill\nand second degree murder: “If you find that the defendant intended to shoot, but did not\nhave the intent to kill, then the resulting death would be a second degree murder on this\ntheory if you find that the death was a natural and probable consequence of the shooting.\nPlease consider this response only in connection with all of the jury instructions as a\nwhole.”\n\n\n       13\n          Although Gomez cites People v. Roberts (1992) 2 Cal.4th 271 in support of his\nargument, this case actually undermines his point. In Roberts, defense counsel requested\na pinpoint instruction to the effect that “if the medical care [the victim] received after the\nassault was so inadequate that it amounted to the sole cause of his death, then he was not\nthe proximate cause of Gardner’s killing and was not liable for it.” (Id. at p. 311.) The\ncourt’s refusal to give this instruction was upheld because, as here, “the record is devoid\nof any evidence of grossly improper treatment. . . . The jury need not be instructed on a\ntheory for which no evidence has been presented. [Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 312 -313.)\n\n\n                                              23\n\f       Gomez contends that the trial court’s statement regarding second degree murder\nwas erroneous because the court did not include the entire definition of second degree\nmurder in its response to the jury. Specifically, he argues that, because the court’s\nresponse to the jury’s question did not mention the third element of implied malice\nmurder, namely that “the act was deliberately performed with knowledge of the danger\nto, and with conscious disregard for, human life” (CALJIC No. 8.31), the response\n“invited the jury to avoid the question of conscious disregard altogether and find\nappellant guilty of second degree murder regardless of whether or not he appreciated and\ndisregarded the risk to human life inherent in his actions.”\n       He is incorrect. Penal Code section 113814 imposes on the trial court a mandatory\n“duty to clear up any instructional confusion expressed by the jury. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Gonzalez (1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1212, superseded by statute on other grounds.) “This\ndoes not mean the court must always elaborate on the standard instructions. Where the\noriginal instructions are themselves full and complete, the court has discretion under\nsection 1138 to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury’s\nrequest for information. [Citation.]” (People v. Beardslee (1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 97.)\n       The trial court responded to a question about only one of the elements of first\ndegree murder—namely, premeditation. This response was appropriately tailored to the\njury’s question. Moreover, the court explicitly stated that its response was not intended\nto encompass all issues related to the crimes of first and second degree murder when it\ninstructed the jury to “consider this response only in connection with all of the jury\ninstructions as a whole.”\n       Gomez does not—indeed, cannot—argue that the court’s instructions with regard\nto first and second degree murder, either initially or after the jury’s inquiry, were\nincorrect. His argument instead is that the court was required to reinstruct the jury on the\nelements of second degree murder. In other words, defendant’s argument is that the court\n\n\n\n       14\n            All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n                                               24\n\fwas precluded from answering the jury’s question about an element of these crimes\nwithout also reinstructing the jury as to all of the elements of these crimes.\n       In fact, the court did make clear to the jury that its response was intended to\nsupplement rather than supplant its earlier instructions. By charging the jury with the\nresponsibility of considering the instruction as a whole, the court ensured that the jury\nwould not misconstrue its response as revising rather than clarifying the earlier\ninstructions. The jury sought an answer to a limited question. It was given one.\nTherefore, it is unlikely it would have considered the court's response as redefining the\nelements of second degree murder.\n       We reject defendant’s argument.\nC.     Threats to Witnesses\n       Gomez next argues that the trial court erred in permitting Oscar Menendez, Jorge\nSanchez, and Luis Ruelas to testify about threats they received before they testified.\nHowever, Gomez also concedes that, under Evidence Code section 780 and People v.\nMendoza (2011) 52 Cal.4th 1056, 1084-1086, such evidence is admissible to assist in the\nassessment of a witness's credibility and instead argues that, under federal law, the\nevidence was inadmissible. (Dudley v. Duckworth (7th Cir. 1988) 854 F.2d 967, 971-\n972.) As defendant acknowledges, we are bound to follow our Supreme Court’s ruling\non this issue and, therefore, reject this argument. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455.)\nD.     Instructions Regarding Testimony of Menendez, Cervantes, Valencia and\n       Ruelas\n       1. Menendez\n       Defendants argue that the trial court erred when it rejected defendant Gomez’s\nrequest that the court instruct the jury that Menendez was an accomplice as a matter of\nlaw and, instead, allowed the jury to determine whether certain witnesses were\naccomplices.15 Accordingly, defendants take issue with a number of instructions given\n\n       15\n          The People correctly point out that Elizalde has waived any objection to the trial\ncourt’s ruling that Menendez, Ruelas, Sanchez, and Valencia were not accomplices as a\n\n                                             25\n\fby the trial court regarding the jury’s consideration of whether certain witnesses were\naccomplices. These instructions include the direction that “[t]he defendant has the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that each of the following\nwitnesses was an accomplice in the crimes charged against the defendants: [¶] Victor\nCervantes [¶] Oscar Menendez [¶] Luis Ruelas [¶] Larry Valencia.” The court also\ninstructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.14 that “[m]erely assenting to or aiding or\nassisting in the commission of a crime without knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the\nperpetrator and without the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging or facilitating\nthe commission of the crime is not criminal. Thus a person who assents to, or aids, or\nassists in, the commission of a crime without that knowledge and without that intent or\npurpose is not an accomplice in the commission of the crime.”\n       Generally, the issue of whether a witness is an accomplice is a factual question.\nOnly when there is no dispute as to either the facts or the inferences reasonably to be\ndrawn from the facts would the court find a witness an accomplice as a matter of law.\n(People v. Fauber (1992) 2 Cal.4th 792, 834; People v. Rodriguez (1986) 42 Cal.3d 730,\n759 (Rodriguez.)\n       Section 1111 defines an accomplice as a person who is liable to prosecution for\nthe identical offense for which the defendant is being tried. In Menendez’s case, his\nresponsibility for McIntosh’s death would have been as an aider and abettor since Gomez\nrather than Menendez was the shooter. (People v. McLain (1988) 46 Cal.3d 97, 106\n[§ 1111 covers all principals to a crime, including aiders and abettors].) Menendez’s\npresence at the scene, his failure to prevent McIntosh’s murder and even his assistance to\nGomez and Mota with knowledge of their criminal purpose (of which there was no\nevidence) would not be enough to support a finding that Menendez was an accomplice as\na matter of law. (Rodriguez, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 760.) Menendez would only be an\n\n\n\nmatter of law. Elizalde told the court that he would “rather leave it [the determination of\nwhether these witnesses were accomplices] up to the jury . . . .” Nevertheless, we\nconsider this issue because it has also been raised by Mota.\n\n\n                                            26\n\faccomplice as a matter of law if the evidence was undisputed that Menendez shared\nGomez and Mota’s criminal purpose. (People v. Sully (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195, 1227.)\n       In fact, there was considerable evidence in the record that Menendez did not even\nrealize that Gomez and Mota intended to look for and kill Norteños, much less share their\ncriminal purpose.16 Menendez testified that at the time McIntosh was murdered he had\nnot committed to being a Varrio Frontero Loco, not wanting that “for my future.” He\nwanted only to be with girls and go to parties with the gang members, “but . . . didn’t like\nthe rest that they used to do.” Although he knew that gang members attacked Norteños,\nhe himself was never asked to join in. Menendez knew that the Norteños were the Varrio\nFrontero Loco’s rivals. Menendez knew what areas were Norteño territory. He also\nknew that if a Varrio Frontero Loco found a Norteño or saw one he was to “[b]eat him up\nand if you have a gun you have to use it.” He did not, however, think that he was\nexpected to hunt Norteños. When he went with Mota and Gomez on April 13, 2008,\nwhich was the day he shot himself by accident, he did not know that they were looking\nfor Norteños to kill. Nor did he think that was the case on April 26, 2008. He did not\nrealize that they were looking for Norteños to kill until the car did not turn toward the\nMcDonald’s on Broadway as he had expected.\n       Menendez’s testimony that he neither wished nor was expected to join in the\nviolence against Norteños, along with his testimony that he was unaware that Gomez and\nMota intended to shoot anyone the night McIntosh was murdered or on the earlier\noccasion when he (Menendez) was accidentally shot, created a factual dispute as to\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          The trial court specifically found that Menendez’s “version of events that when\nhe first shot himself that is because he was grabbing the gun out of the hands of whoever\nwas holding it to prevent him from shooting someone. On the second occasion he didn’t\nknow that anyone had the gun until Mr. Gomez pulled it out and started shooting. [¶] So\nmy view is if the jury accepts Mr. Menendez’s version of events, it is not as a matter of\nlaw that he is an accomplice. That is a factual dispute the jury must decide. [¶] And I am\nessentially finding the same thing as to all of the ones I listed in the instruction saying\nthat the defense has the burden of proving it by a preponderance.”\n\n\n                                             27\n\fwhether he was an accomplice. The court, therefore, properly put this matter before the\njury.\n        Gomez argues for the first time on appeal that the People were judicially estopped\nfrom opposing his argument that the court should instruct the jury that Menendez was an\naccomplice as a matter of law because they had earlier obtained an indictment that stated\nthat Menendez “went hunting for Norteños with [Gomez] and Mr. Mota and that Mr.\nMcIntosh was killed with Mr. Menendez’s gun . . . .”\n        The application of judicial estoppel is discretionary. (Levin v. Ligon (2006) 140\nCal.App.4th 1456, 1468). Because Gomez did not request at trial that the court exercise\nits discretion in this regard, he has forfeited this argument on appeal. (People v. Scott\n(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 353; People v. Williams (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 649, 655.)\n        In any event, the trial court would surely not have granted such a request. The\ncourt has the discretion to impose this remedy “ ‘ “when a party’s inconsistent behavior\nwill otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice.” ’ ” (Levin v. Ligon, supra, 140\nCal.App.4th at p. 1468.) The People did not engage in inconsistent behavior. The\nindictment did not allege that Menendez was an accomplice as a matter of law. At best, it\ncontains language that could support such an argument. The record contained ample\nevidence to the contrary and the trial court properly made its decision based on this\nevidence.\n        2. Cervantes\n        There was little evidence that Cervantes conspired with Varrio Frontero Loco to\nkill Norteños or that he was otherwise involved in any of the crimes committed by\ndefendants. Cervantes testified that he gave Molina a ride home after he got out of jail\nand spoke to him about the killing of an unnamed Norteño. Although there was evidence\nthat Cervantes was a member of Mexican Locos, there was no evidence that he shared\nMota or Elizalde’s intention to kill Norteños in order to increase the stature of Varrio\nFrontero Loco in the community. Therefore, the trial court properly left to the jury the\nquestion of whether Cervantes was an accomplice.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       3.     Valencia\n       There was also a factual dispute about whether Valencia was an accomplice to the\nPerez murder. Menendez testified that he did not think Valencia was even a gang\nmember. Valencia testified that he was not a gang member and only went in the car with\nAzamar after they encouraged him to do so. Valencia was aware that they had driven\ninto Norteño territory, but he had never seen anyone killed before. In fact, he asked to be\ndriven home after the murder rather than join in the bragging and celebration that\nfollowed.\n       The fact that Valencia was present at the scene and did not prevent the Perez\nmurder is insufficient to make him an accomplice. Moreover, even if there was evidence\n(and there was not) that he assisted Mota and Molina in the murder, this would not be\nsufficient for a finding that he was an accomplice. (Rodriguez, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p.\n760.) Our review of the record reveals that the trial court did not have before it\nundisputed evidence that Valencia shared Gomez and Mota’s criminal purpose. (People\nv. Sully, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 1227.) Therefore, it was not required to instruct the jury\nthat Valencia was an accomplice as a matter of law.\n       4.     Ruelas\n       Ruelas, like Elizalde, was not present at any of the murders. In addition, there is\nno evidence in the record directly linking him to any of the crimes committed by\ndefendants. His complicity in these crimes would, therefore, be as a co-conspirator.\n       There was conflicting evidence about whether Ruelas had assumed a co-\nconspirator role in “bringing the hood back.” Ruelas appeared to be an important\nmember of Varrio Frontero Loco. Sanchez testified that, in terms of the hierarchy of\nVarrio Frontero Loco, Elizalde was the leader, and Sanchez was directly under him along\nwith Mota, Ruelas, and several others. According to Sanchez, Ruelas was one of the\nVarrio Frontero Loco who were “going to bring them back . . . just the ones who got to\ntake care of everything.” Menendez also named a number of Varrio Frontero Loco as\nthose with the most respect in the gang. Ruelas was among them. Elizalde also would\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fsend Ruelas out to collect debts using violence. Ruelas testified that violence was “an\nimportant part of bringing the hood back.”\n       Ruelas himself testified that he was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco for six\nyears until 2008. There was evidence, however, that Ruelas’s involvement in Varrio\nFrontero Loco was most significant and committed before Elizalde assumed control.\nRuelas did not like Elizalde. Although Elizalde had given him an order to kill someone,\nRuelas did not do so because he was working as an informant and had agreed not to\nparticipate in the commission of any crimes.\n       Given the factual dispute about Ruelas’s accomplice status, the trial court did not\nerr in putting the question to the jury.\n       5.     Prejudice\n       Even if the trial court did err in putting the accomplice question to the jury, “[a]\ntrial court’s failure to instruct on accomplice liability under section 1111 is harmless if\nthere is sufficient corroborating evidence in the record. [Citation.] ‘Corroborating\nevidence may be slight, may be entirely circumstantial, and need not be sufficient to\nestablish every element of the charged offense. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] The evidence is\nsufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the crime in such a way as to satisfy\nthe jury that the accomplice is telling the truth. [Citation.]” (People v. Lewis (2001) 26\nCal.4th 334, 370.)\n       We reject defendants’ argument that the witnesses’ testimony was insufficiently\ncorroborated. First, with regard to Oscar Menendez, Menendez testified that after he\nwitnessed the McIntosh shooting, he did not want to join in Mota and Gomez’s\ncelebration of the murder and asked them to take him home. He testified that when they\narrived at his house, Mota told Menendez that he was on parole and couldn’t have the\ngun. Mota told Menendez to take the gun. This testimony was corroborated by San\nPablo Police Detective David Hoff, who testified that he did in fact find the gun used in\nthe McIntosh shooting in Menendez’s bedroom. Menendez’s description of the way in\nwhich McIntosh was approached was also corroborated. Menendez testified that when\nMota spotted Rico McIntosh, Gomez asked him “if he is a buster.” McIntosh’s friend\n\n\n                                             30\n\fLorry Scherrer testified that McIntosh told her after the shooting that he had been\napproached by three people who asked him if he was a “buster” before they shot him.\nSan Pablo Police Officer Matthew Spanner also testified that McIntosh told him that he\nwas asked if he was a “buster” before he was shot. The testimony of Hoff, Scherrer and\nSpanner provide sufficient corroboration of Menendez’s testimony.\n       Second, Victor Cervantes testified that when he picked Molina up from jail,\nMolina told him that he had been released because he had been caught with a gun that\nwas not the murder weapon. Molina also told him, in effect, that he and Romero had\nmurdered Centron. Molina’s telephone calls to his mother in which he made the same\nadmission adequately corroborate Cervantes’s testimony.\n       Third, Luis Ruelas’s testimony that Molina told him that he had killed Centron\nwas corroborated by the same telephone calls to his mother that corroborated Cervantes’s\ntestimony.\n       Finally, Valencia testified that when Camacho got out of the car he said to Luis\nPerez “Show me your hands, show me your hands.” When Perez yelled “[w]hat the fuck\nis going on?” Camacho immediately shot him. This was corroborated by a neighbor who\nheard the confrontation, Ganehin Saele. Saele testified that she heard someone say “what\nthe fuck?” and then heard gunshots.\nE.     Batson-Wheeler\n       Mota contends that, in exercising a peremptory challenge against Juror Number 5,\nthe only African-American juror on the panel, the prosecutor violated his right to a trial\nby a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community, a right guaranteed\nunder both the California Constitution (article I, section 16) and the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. He is incorrect.\n       1.     Factual Background\n       After the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to Juror No. 5, defense\ncounsel moved for a mistrial under Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson) and\nPeople v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 (Wheeler), overruled in part by Johnson v.\nCalifornia (2005) 545 U.S. 162 (Johnson).\n\n\n                                             31\n\f       Defense counsel told the court that Juror No. 5 would be the only African-\nAmerican seated on the jury. According to counsel, this juror had “27 years of military\nexperience. He did not indicate any biases, and I believe that he is being relieved because\nof his race.” The court asked the prosecutor to respond “to the issue of a prima facie\nshowing.”\n       The prosecutor offered the following response: “I do not believe there is any\nprima facie showing, and this is why: I worked extremely hard to rehabilitate a juror\nnamed [Mr. P.]. [¶] Mr. [P.] was actually seated next to [Juror No. 5] last week when he\ncame into the box immediately in front of [Juror No. 5]. [¶] Mr. [P.] was an African-\nAmerican male about the same age as [Juror No. 5], and I liked a lot of things about Mr.\n[P.], including his job along with his wife’s experience as an emergency room nurse.\n[¶] Unfortunately, as you may recall, I worked hard to rehabilitate him, and he said that I\nhad gotten him from the defense starting on the 30 yard line up to the 45. [¶] He was\nclose to not being for cause, but I didn’t do my job well enough, I suppose, and he ended\nup being a for cause challenge made by Mr. Morton and Ms. Bethards. [¶] That was an\nAfrican-American juror that we lost, who[m] I was perfectly satisfied with. [¶] On the\nother hand, I don’t believe I need to give my reasons at this point, because you haven’t\nmade a prima facie case, but I do think the fact that I worked hard to rehabilitate one\nAfrican-American juror, was not able to do so, cuts directly against any argument that\nthere is a prima facie case of discrimination based on race in the People’s peremptory\nchallenge, or voir dire strategy.”\n       Defendants argued that the People’s effort to rehabilitate an African-American\njuror was insignificant in light of the fact that Juror No. 5 was a candidate who was\n“completely neutral.”\n       The court ruled that defendants had failed to make a prima facie case. The court\nexplained that, under the standard articulated in Johnson, supra, 545 U.S. 162,17 “I do\n\n\n       17\n        The court correctly summarized that standard as requiring an inquiry into\n“whether the defendant has shown based on the totality of the relevant facts that those\n\n                                             32\n\fnot believe the facts as [a] totality before me would suggest that inference is appropriate.\n[¶] I do understand . . . that a person of the African-American race is within a cognizable\ngroup, and I do know that the law . . . permits a finding of . . . a prima facie case on the\nbasis of a single strike of that group. So it’s not a numerical issue, it’s the conduct of the\nvoir dire as a whole.” The court also noted that “I do think that [Juror No. 5] is the first\nAfrican-American who has been in the box for purposes of peremptories. [¶] We have\nhad other African-American potential jurors, but they have been excused for cause or\nhardships. [¶] The record would reflect that so far [Juror No. 5] is the only African-\nAmerican in the box as I have indicated; that the defendants are of Hispanic descent, to\nthe extent that may or may not be relevant, but, in any event, I don’t find a prima facie\ncase, but you may state your reasons for the record.”18\n       The prosecutor stated “for the record” that “there are a lot of good things about\n[Juror No. 5], including his military service. Unfortunately, the main part of his military\nservice was serving as a substance abuse counselor. . . . [A]lmost as a general rule, I am\nnot going to leave counselors or psychiatrists on a criminal jury. [¶] On top of that, I\nspecifically questioned [Juror No. 5] about this, a substance abuse counselor in his\nposition worked with almost, I think he said, almost 90 percent of his work had been\ninvolved in criminal activity and had been accused or convicted for drug activity.\nSomebody that works with felons or convicted misdemeanants or convicted felons on a\ndaily basis is not someone I want on a criminal jury of any sort, no matter what color,\nwhat creed, what race they are.”\n       The court then excused Juror No. 5. Defendants now argue that it erred in so\ndoing. We disagree.\n\n\n\nfacts give rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose or whether the evidence is\nsufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.”\n       18\n         Although we conclude that, because the trial court correctly found that no prima\nfacie case had been shown, the prosecutor’s explanation of his rationale for excluding\nJuror No. 5 is not relevant to the question of whether there a prima facie case has been\nmade, we nevertheless include this information in order to discuss that issue.\n\n\n                                              33\n\f          2.     Discussion\n          We apply certain well-established principles in deciding this issue. “[T]he use of\nperemptory challenges by a prosecutor to strike prospective jurors on the basis of group\nmembership violates the right of a criminal defendant to trial by a jury drawn from a\nrepresentative cross-section of the community under article 1, section 16 of the California\nConstitution.” (People v. Alvarez (1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 192; see also Wheeler, supra,\n22 Cal.3d at p. 272.) This discriminatory use of peremptory challenges similarly violates\nthe defendant's federal constitutional right to equal protection. (Batson, supra, 476 U.S.\nat pp. 84-89.) [¶] We presume the People use their preemptory challenges in a\nconstitutional manner. (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 278; People v. Alvarez, supra, 14\nCal.4th at p. 193.) For this reason, the defendant bears the burden of establishing a prima\nfacie case of purposeful discrimination. (People v. Arias (1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 134-135;\nPeople v. Gutierrez (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1083, 1122; People v. Alvarez, supra, 14 Cal.4th at\np. 193.) To do so, the defendant must raise this issue “ ‘ “in timely fashion and make a\nprima facie case of such discrimination to the satisfaction of the court. First, . . . he\nshould make as complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible. Second, he must\nestablish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group within the\nmeaning of the representative cross-section rule. Third, from all the circumstances of the\ncase he must show a strong likelihood [or reasonable inference] that such persons are\nbeing challenged because of their group association . . . .” ’ [Citations.]” (People v. Box\n(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1187-1188, disapproved on another ground in People v. Martinez\n(2010) 47 Cal.4th 911, 948, fn. 10.)\n          When we conclude that the trial court correctly ruled that a defendant failed to\nshow a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, we do not “review the adequacy of\ncounsel’s justifications for the peremptory challenges.’ ” (People v. Box, supra, 23\nCal.4th at p. 1188.) The fact that a prosecutor is permitted to make a record of his\njustifications for exercising a peremptory challenge does not change this basic rule.\n(Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                               34\n\f       On appeal, we must determine whether substantial evidence supports the trial\ncourt’s conclusion. (People v. McDermott (2002) 28 Cal.4th 946, 970.) Because it does,\nwe reject defendant’s argument.\n       Here, the trial court found that defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of\ndiscriminatory intent. Substantial evidence supports the court’s conclusion that the\ntotality of the relevant facts did not “give rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.”\nFirst, the fact that the People made an effort—and a vigorous one at that—to rehabilitate\nanother African-American juror points to the People’s lack of a “discriminatory purpose”\nin its exercise of a peremptory challenge to Juror No. 5. Simply put, if the prosecutor had\nsuch a purpose, we would not expect the prosecutor to make a case against excusing a\ndifferent African-American juror.\n       The People also point out that the prosecutor earlier passed on a jury that actually\ncontained Juror No. 5. The prosecutor did not actually exercise a peremptory challenge\nagainst Juror No. 5 until a juror on the original panel had to be excused and jury selection\nresumed. Although more than one inference can be drawn from the fact that the\nprosecutor had earlier passed on Juror No. 5 and did not excuse him until jury selection\nwas reopened, one reasonable inference—and the inference the trial court made—is that\nthe prosecutor was not concerned with the race of jurors in his selection decisions.\nSubstantial evidence, therefore, supports the trial court’s finding that defense failed to\nmake out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection.19\n       Defendants, however, argue that, when we take into account the prosecutor’s “for\nthe record” explanation for his prima facie challenge, an explanation the trial court\n\n\n\n       19\n         Defendants correctly argue that their burden of making out a prima facie case\ncan be met even as to a single peremptory challenge to an African-American juror.\n(People v. Thomas (2011) 51 Cal.4th 449, 474.) However, although the People argue to\nthe contrary, the trial court did not base its conclusion that no prima facie case was shown\non the fact that the prosecutor only excused one African-American juror. In any event,\nour review of the record indicates that substantial evidence supports the trial court’s\nconclusion.\n\n\n                                             35\n\fcorrectly observed was irrelevant to its determination of whether defendant had made out\na prima facie, we must find that the trial court erred. We disagree.\n       A trial court does not scrutinize a prosecutor’s explanation for his exercise of a\nperemptory challenge until after it concludes that the defendant has made out a prima\nfacie case of discrimination. The trial court’s prima facie ruling here was explicitly—and\ncorrectly—not based on the prosecutor’s stated rationale, which came after the court\nmade its ruling. We do not consider such a statement when we ask whether substantial\nevidence supports the court’s ruling on the question of whether defendants had met their\nprima facie burden. (People v. Box, supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 1188, disapproved on another\nground in People v. Martinez (2010) 47 Cal.4th 911, 948, fn. 10; People v. Davenport\n(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1171, 1200, abrogated on other grounds in People v. Griffin (2004) 33\nCal.4th 536, 555, fn. 5.) Thus, while we consider the “entire record of voir dire” in our\nreview (People v. Box, supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 1188), once we “ ‘conclude[] that the trial\ncourt properly determined that no prima facie case was made, [we] need not review the\nadequacy of counsel’s justifications for the peremptory challenges.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       The cases on which defendants rely in making the contrary argument involve\nsituations in which the trial court had either explicitly or implicitly found that the\ndefendant had made a prima facie case. These inapposite cases, therefore, are not helpful\nto defendants.\n       In Kesser v. Cambra (9th Cir. 2006) 465 F.3d 351, 360, the court implicitly found\nthat defense counsel had made out a prima facie case of discrimination and was,\ntherefore, concerned with the ultimate question of whether the lower court erred in\nfinding that the prosecutor had not exercised his peremptory challenges in a\ndiscriminatory way. Similarly, in Crittenden v. Ayers (2010) 624 F.3d 943, 950\n(Crittenden), the court registered its agreement with the California Supreme Court’s\nearlier decision in the matter that “Crittenden made a prima facie showing of\ndiscrimination and that the state carried its burden of articulating a race-neutral\njustification for the peremptory strike.” Crittenden, therefore, does not support\ndefendants’ argument regarding the trial court’s analysis of the record at the prima facie\n\n\n                                              36\n\fstage. Finally, in Johnson v. Vasquez (9th Cir. 1993) 3 F.3d 1327, 1329, footnote 2\n(Vasquez), the court announced that it “need not address the question whether Johnson\noffered prima facie evidence of intentional discrimination [citation], because the\nprosecutor offered an explanation for the challenge, and the trial court ruled on the\nultimate question of discrimination. [Citation.]” The Vasquez court, therefore, did not\nanalyze the issue of whether the defendant had made out a prima facie case because the\ntrial court had impliedly ruled that a prima facie case had been shown. Given that the\ndefendant had met his burden, the court of appeal looked only at the “ultimate question of\ndiscrimination,” an inquiry that does involve scrutiny of the prosecutor’s explanation for\nhis challenge.\n       Here, in contrast to Kesser, Crittenden, and Vasquez, the trial court explicitly ruled\nthat defendants had not met their burden of showing a prima facie case, and correctly did\nnot consider the prosecutor's explanation for his peremptory challenge.20 Therefore,\nwhen we consider this issue, we look only at the record before the trial court at the time it\nmade its prima facie case ruling.\nF.     Corroboration of Sanchez Testimony\n       Mota also argues that Sanchez—whom the trial court found was an accomplice as\na matter of law—was not adequately corroborated as required by section 1111 and,\ntherefore, the jury could not have relied on it to reach its verdicts. We disagree.\n       With regard to the Centron murder, Sanchez’s testimony regarding Molina’s role\nas the shooter was confirmed by Molina’s admission to his mother that he had, in fact,\nshot Centron. Sanchez’s testimony regarding the McIntosh murder to the effect that\nMota told him he had shot someone that night, was corroborated by the testimony of\nDetective David Hoff that he had found the gun Gomez used in the shooting in\nMenendez’s bedroom. In addition, Contra Costa County Deputy Sheriff Criminalist\nTerreance Wong’s expert testimony that the gun recovered from Menendez’s bedroom\n\n\n       20\n          The prosecutor’s decision to put these reasons “on the record,” following the\ntrial court’s decision regarding the prima facie case issue does not alter this procedure.\n\n\n                                             37\n\fwas the weapon used to shoot McIntosh corroborated Sanchez’s testimony regarding the\nshooting. Moreover, even if Sanchez’s testimony was not admissible, our review of the\nrecord indicates that there was ample evidence, particularly from the testimony of\nMenendez, Ruelas, Cervantes and Valencia to support defendants’ convictions.\nG.      Admissibility of Mota's Booking Statements Regarding Gang Membership\n        1.       Facts\n        On May 3, 2008, after he was arrested, Mota was taken to the Contra Costa\nCounty’s Martinez detention facility. When an arrestee such as Mota first arrives at the\ndetention facility, an “escort deputy” meets him and asks three questions. “They will ask\nthem if they have been here before. That will aid the booking officer in bringing up their\ninformation. [¶] They will ask them if they have any gang affiliations so that they\nknow . . . where to put them once they come inside of intake. [¶] And then they will ask\nthem if they have any fears for their safety.” If a suspect reports any fear for his safety,\nrequests protective custody or if they belong to a gang “they will go into one of the rooms\nto await . . . the processing . . . .”\n        Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Deputy Michael Rector and Deputy Gonzalez,21\nwere the “back door intake” deputies that evening and the first deputies Mota\nencountered when he arrived at the detention facility. Upon his arrival, Mota was put in a\nseparate room. When Rector told Mota he was going to search him for contraband, Mota\n“began to laugh nervously.” Mota then said, “man, I’m in here for some shit that I didn’t\ndo. They said that I killed someone, but it wasn’t me. I was there, but I didn’t kill\nanyone. The guy that did it is already in jail. He confessed already, but now he is trying\nto bring me down too . . . .” Mota became agitated and said, “I’m a gang banger, but I’m\nnot a murderer.” He then told Rector that “I told those other cops that I didn’t know\nanything because I thought I would be in trouble, but now I don’t care . . . .” Rector\nasked Mota if he wanted to talk to a San Pablo Police detective. Mota replied, “Yeah, I\n\n\n\n        21\n             Deputy Gonzalez did not testify.\n\n\n                                                38\n\fwill, but first I should talk to my lawyer. After I talk to him I will tell you guys what\nreally went down . . . .”\n       Rector did not ask Mota about his gang affiliation. He did, however, understand\nthat Mota was involved in a gang, based on earlier statements Mota had made to Deputy\nGonzalez, who was working alongside him that evening.\n       Mota’s statements struck Rector as important to the San Pablo Police Department,\nso he wrote up a summary of the conversation in order to “assist them in their case.”22\n       Following Rector and Gonzalez’s interaction with Mota, Deputy Bryan Zaiser,\nwho worked in the facility’s classification unit, interviewed Mota. He did so because\nMota appeared to be gang affiliated. Zaiser would typically tell the arrestee that the\nclassification questions were for an “administrative purpose,” and “for their housing.”\nPrior to the interview, Zaiser did not read Miranda warnings to Mota, did not advise him\nthat he had a right to decline to answer the questions nor did he tell him he was required\nto answer the questions. Mota did not express any fear for his safety before the\ninterview.\n       Zaiser filled out a classification questionnaire when he spoke to Mota. Zaiser\nindicated on the questionnaire that Mota identified himself as “affiliated with the Sureño\nstreet gang,” and said he was “part of VFL, which is Varrio Frontero Loco,” and had\nbeen since he was 14 years old. According to Zaiser, Mota told him that he (Mota) was\nan active Sureño gang member.\n       At the time he interviewed him, Zaiser was aware that Mota had been charged\nwith murder.23 He did not know that Mota had been accused of killing a “suspected\nNorteño.”\n\n\n\n       22\n         Generally, when an arrestee identified himself as a gang member, the deputy\nwould write a “classification incident detail report,” which would then be forwarded to a\nsupervisor, who would forward the report to “the appropriate people.”\n       23\n         It was common for the arresting agency (in this case, the San Pablo Police to\nbring with them “booking paperwork with the charges they are booking the inmate for.”\n\n\n                                             39\n\f       Zaiser testified that, because of the risk of harm to an inmate suspected of killing a\nNorteño, he would not house that inmate in the general population, where Norteños were\nhoused. There was separate housing for Sureños.\n       Each of the murder charges against Mota alleged an enhancement for participating\nin a criminal street gang pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1). He was also\ncharged under section 182.5 with participating in a criminal street gang.\n       Before trial, Mota moved to suppress his admission of gang membership. He\nargued that because the sheriff’s deputies to whom he disclosed his gang affiliation knew\nor should reasonably have known that the questions about his gang affiliation were likely\nto elicit an incriminating response, they were required to give Miranda warnings before\nquestioning him.\n       The People contended that because none of the sheriff’s deputies who discussed\nwith Mota his gang status were actually aware that he had been charged with gang-related\ncrimes, the questions he was asked were part of a custodial interrogation for which no\nMiranda warnings were required.\n       In admitting this evidence, the court made a number of factual findings. First, it\nfound that “the sole purpose of this interview and the form is to ensure the safety of\ninmates and staff at the county jail. The information gathered is essential to maintain\nsecurity at the jail. . . . [¶] . . . [I]f the jail were to house rival gang members together at\nrandom it would pose a grave security risk to both the inmates and the staff. [¶] So I find\nthat it is a fundamental and essential obligation of the sheriff’s department to determine\nwhether it is dangerous to house any inmate with any other inmate or any gang member\nwith any rival gang member.”\n       The trial court stressed that although Zaiser knew that Mota had been charged with\nmurder, Zaiser was not aware of the gang enhancement and gang charges alleged against\nMota. The court found, therefore, that Zaiser “had no actual subjective intent to gather\nincriminating information.” The court also noted that Zaiser’s subjective intent was “not\nthe standard but it is a relevant factor.”\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\f       Zaiser did not, in the court’s opinion, “use any coercive tactics, that is, no threats,\nno promises. There was no threat that if . . . Mr. Mota didn’t answer the questions, that\nhe would be housed with Norteños.” With regard to Mota’s understanding of the purpose\nof these questions, the court found “that Mr. Mota would have every reason to make sure\nthat the deputies knew to house him with Sureños. It would be in Mr. Mota’s wholly\npersonal interest in self-preservation that he be classified correctly. And it would be\nextreme danger to his life if he were not classified correctly and housed with other\nSureños. [¶] So my view is that Mr. Mota would have wanted the deputies to know that\nhe was a Sureño so his life would not be imperiled. And I believe he willingly and\nvoluntarily answered the questions for that reason.”\n       The court denied the motion to dismiss and Mota’s admission of gang membership\nwas admitted at trial. The jury ultimately found Mota guilty of the street gang conspiracy\ncharge and also found the street gang enhancements true as to the three charged\nhomicides of which he was found guilty.\n       2.     Discussion\n       Mota contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the\nstatements he made during his classification interview. He argues that this interview\nconstituted a custodial interrogation and, therefore, the law enforcement personnel he\nspoke with were required to read him his Miranda rights. We agree.\n       In Rhode Island v. Innis (1980) 446 U.S. 291 (Innis), the United States Supreme\nCourt clarified what sort of police action constitutes a “custodial interrogation” that must\nbe preceded by a Miranda warning. The Innis court held that “ ‘interrogation’ under\nMiranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the\npart of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the\npolice should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the\nsuspect.”24 (Innis, supra, 446 U.S. at p. 301.) Accordingly, “[a] practice that the police\n\n       24\n          The court also noted that “[t]he latter portion of this definition focuses primarily\nupon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus\nreflects the fact that the Miranda safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody\n\n                                              41\n\fshould know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect . . .\namounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the\nunforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend\nonly to words or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were\nreasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.” (Innis, supra, 446 U.S. at pp. 301-\n302.)\n        Ten years later, in Pennsylvania v. Muniz (1990) 496 U.S. 582, 600-602 (Muniz),\nthe court considered whether the Miranda safeguards came into play when a police\nofficer asked a suspect in custody for—among other things—his “name, address, height,\nweight, eye color, date of birth, and current age . . . .” 25\n        In considering this question, the court began with the general rule set out in Innis,\nthat “[c]ustodial interrogation for purposes of Miranda includes both express questioning\nand words or actions that, given the officer’s knowledge of any special susceptibilities of\nthe suspect, the officer knows or reasonably should know are likely to ‘have . . . the force\nof a question on the accused,’ [citation] and therefore be reasonably likely to elicit an\nincriminating response.” The court then concluded that questioning a suspect about his\nname, address, height weight, eye color date of birth and current age fell “within a\n‘routine booking question’ exception” to Miranda, an exception that applies to questions\nasked in order to secure the “ ‘ “biographical data necessary to complete booking or\npretrial services.” ’ ” In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the lower court’s\n\nwith an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to\nobjective proof of the underlying intent of the police.” (Innis, supra, 446 U.S. at p. 301.)\n        25\n          Although the United States Supreme Court considered this issue for the first\ntime in Muniz, it noted that a number of federal courts had previously found that “routine\nbiographical questions” fell outside the scope of Miranda. These cases were United\nStates v. Glen-Archila (11th Cir. 1982) 677 F.2d 809, 815-816 (home address); United\nStates v. Avery (6th Cir. 1983) 717 F.2d 1020, 1024-1025 (“subjects such as defendant’s\ndate of birth and address” in order to complete an identification form which “did not\nrelate, even tangentially, to criminal activity”) and United States v. Mata-Abundiz (9th\nCir. 1983) 717 F.2d 1277 (background questions not asked during routine booking\nprocedure and directly related to an element of crime the interrogating officer suspected\nof defendant did not fall within routine booking exception).\n\n\n                                               42\n\ffactual finding that these questions “were ‘requested for record-keeping purposes only,’\n[citation] and therefore the questions appear reasonably related to the police’s\nadministrative concerns.” (Muniz, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 601-602.)\n       Even before the United States Supreme Court decided Muniz, our Supreme Court,\nin People v. Rucker (1980) 26 Cal.3d 368, 387 (Rucker), held that “[t]he Miranda\nsafeguards are not necessary at a proper booking interview at which certain basic\ninformation is elicited having nothing to do with the circumstances surrounding any\noffense with which the defendant has been charged. [Citations.] The booking procedure,\nas defined by statute (Pen. Code, § 7, subd. 21), has been described as ‘essentially a\nclerical process.’ [Citation.] The limited information needed at a booking procedure is\nrequired solely for the purposes of internal jail administration, not for use in connection\nwith any criminal proceeding against the arrestee. When use of this information is\nconfined to those proper purposes, its elicitation cannot be considered incriminatory.”\n       The Rucker court went on to hold, however, that although Miranda warnings\n“need not be given at a booking interrogation” intended to elicit “from an arrestee the\nbasic, neutral information that is necessary for proper jail administration, [the state is\nforbidden to use] the arrestee’s responses in any manner in a subsequent criminal\nproceeding.”26 The court explained that “[i]t is not just the nature of the information\nrevealed but the potential for incrimination under all the circumstances that is important.\nIn the present case, appellant had been arrested for a homicide. Homicide is ‘ “an area\npermeated with criminal statutes,” ’ and those arrested for murder are, for purposes of the\nprivilege, ‘a group “inherently suspect of criminal activities.” ’ [Citation.] . . . Evidence\nof an arrestee’s responses to booking questions can constitute ‘evidence which will\nfacilitate [his] conviction[ ]’ unless its use is limited to the purposes for which it was\n\n\n       26\n          Similarly, the court in United States v. Willock (D.Md.2010) 682 F.Supp.2d 512,\n528-529, observed that “[e]liciting information from an inmate about his gang affiliation\nsolely for prison administrative purposes does not implicate Miranda. It is only when\nsuch information is used against the inmate in a prosecution that Miranda warnings are\nrequired.” (Id. at p. 533, fn. 26.)\n\n\n                                              43\n\felicited. [Citation.]” (Rucker, supra, 26 Cal.3d at p. 389.) Although Rucker appears to\nhave been superseded by Proposition 8 (People v. Herbst (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 793,\n799-800), the Rucker court’s definition of a routine “booking procedure” is consistent\nwith that articulated in Muniz—a procedure designed to elicit “basic, neutral\ninformation.” (Rucker, supra, 26 Cal.3d at pp. 388-389.)\n        Our Supreme Court very recently considered the booking exception in People v.\nWilliams (2013) 56 Cal.4th 165 (Williams). In that case, a suspect in custody told a\npolice officer during his intake interview that he needed protection because an\nunidentified inmate had threatened to stab him. (Id. at p. 183.) When one of the officers\nasked why he had been threatened, defendant responded “ ‘[b]ecause I killed two\nHispanics.’ ” (Id. at p. 184.) Another officer recalled asking defendant what his crime\nwas. The officer noted defendant’s statement that he had killed two Hispanics in an\ninterview intake report that he did not provide to any investigating agency. (Id. at p.\n184.) The statement was ultimately used at trial against the defendant.\n        The Williams court held that defendant's un-Mirandized admission that he had\n“killed two Hispanics” fell under the booking exception to Miranda. In so doing, the\ncourt cited the Innis court's definition of interrogation: “ ‘[T]he term “interrogation”\nunder Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on\nthe part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the\npolice should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the\nsuspect. . . . [T]he Miranda safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an\nadded measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective\nproof of the underlying intent of the police. . . . [S]ince the police surely cannot be held\naccountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of\ninterrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they\nshould have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.’ ” (Innis,\nsupra, 446 U.S. at pp. 301-302, fns. omitted.).”) (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 186-\n187.)\n\n\n\n                                             44\n\f       The court, citing People v. Gomez (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 609, 630, then noted\nthat the “governing considerations” in determining whether questions fall within the\nbooking exception are as follows: “’ In determining whether a question is within the\nbooking question exception, courts should carefully scrutinize the facts surrounding the\nencounter to determine whether the questions are legitimate booking questions or a\npretext for eliciting incriminating information. [Citation.] Courts have considered\nseveral factors, including the nature of the questions, such as whether they seek merely\nidentifying data necessary for booking [citations]; the context of the interrogation, such\nas whether the questions were asked during a noninvestigative clerical booking process\nand pursuant to a standard booking form or questionnaire [citations]; the knowledge and\nintent of the government agent asking the questions [citations]; the relationship between\nthe question asked and the crime the defendant was suspected of committing [citations];\nthe administrative need for the information sought [citations]; and any other indications\nthat the questions were designed, at least in part, to elicit incriminating evidence and\nmerely asked under the guise or pretext of seeking routine biographical information\n[citations].’ [Citation.]” (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 187.)\n       The Williams court concluded that Williams’ “intake interview at Folsom Prison\nwas closely analogous to the process of being booked into jail.” The court pointed out\nthat not only did the officers have no intention of eliciting an incriminating response, but\nthe follow up questions they asked were not ones they should reasonably have expected\nto elicit an incriminating response. The court explained: “Whether it was White or Reed\nwho asked defendant either ‘why are they going to stab you?’ (as White remembered), or\n‘what his crime was’ (as Reed recalled), neither question was designed to elicit an\nincriminating response.” The officers were appropriately responding to defendant's own\nsecurity concern, and would not reasonably have expected him to produce a confession.\n(Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 188.)\n       Turning now to this case, we begin by noting that the trial court found that\nalthough the deputies were aware that Mota had been charged with murder, they were not\nspecifically aware that, in addition to murder, Mota had been charged with an\n\n\n                                             45\n\fenhancement and an additional crime based on his gang membership. Therefore, they did\nnot ask Mota this question in order to elicit an incriminating response. However, as the\ntrial court recognized, whether a particular question was intentionally designed by the\npolice to evoke an incriminating response is only one fact the court looks at in\ndetermining whether words or actions on the part of a police officer constitute an\ninterrogation. Innis, Muniz and Williams all make clear that an officer’s subjective intent\nin asking a question is neither the only fact nor the determinative fact the court should\nconsider in determining whether a question falls within the booking exception.\nTherefore, even if a question was not intended to evoke an incriminating response, if it\nwas a question the officer should have reasonably expected to evoke such a response it\nwould fall outside the booking exception.\n       Here, the deputy who asked Mota whether he belonged to a gang “should [have]\nknow[n]” that question was “reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response . . . .”\n(Muniz, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 601.) Section 186.22, which imposes criminal penalties for\nparticipation in a criminal street gang, is part of the California Street Terrorism\nEnforcement and Prevention Act enacted in 1988. This enhancement had been in\nexistence for more than 20 years before Mota was questioned, and it is unlikely that the\ndeputy was unaware that participation in a criminal street gang is a felony or that an\naffirmative answer to the question would be incriminating. Similarly, section 182.5,\nwhich imposes an additional penalty for conspiracy to commit a felony by active\nparticipants in a criminal street gang, was added by section 3 of Proposition 21, the Gang\nViolence and Juvenile Crime Prevention Act of 1998, which was effective on March 8,\n2000. In light of the length of time these laws had been on the books, a law enforcement\nprofessional should have known that an incoming inmate’s admission of gang\nmembership could well be incriminating.\n       It was also unlikely that the deputy would be unaware of the possibility that Mota\nmight be a gang member and thus particularly likely to give an incriminating response to\nthis question. The trial court found that this facility housed a large population of gang\nmembers, so many that they created a serious and real risk to the safety of inmates in\n\n\n                                             46\n\frival gangs as well as to the deputies themselves. A law enforcement official working in\nthis milieu would not only be particularly likely to be aware of laws designed to deter\nsuch violence, he would also be aware that many inmates coming into the facility might\nbelong to gangs. In such a setting, the possibility that an inmate’s gang affiliation might\nbe incriminating was neither abstract nor remote. Therefore, the deputies should have\nknown that asking for this information was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating\nresponse from Mota. And, of course, it did.27\n       Nor did this question seek “routine biographical information” that would fall\nwithin the booking exception to Miranda. The nature of the information for which this\nexception is intended to apply is aptly demonstrated by the cases the Muniz plurality\nrecognized as establishing this exception and by Muniz itself. The pre-Muniz cases cited\nby that court involve questions designed to gather “mere pedigree information” or\n“routine background information.” (United States v. Avery, supra, 717 F.2d at pp. 1024-\n1025 [“subjects such as defendant’s date of birth and address” in order to complete the\nidentification form which “did not relate, even tangentially, to criminal activity”]; United\nStates v. Mata-Abundiz, supra, 717 F.2d 1277 [background questions, which were not\nasked during routine booking procedure, were directly related to an element of crime the\ninterrogating officer suspected of defendant did not fall within routine booking\nexception]; United States v. Glen-Archila, supra, 677 F.2d at pp. 815-816 (11th Cir.\n1982) [home address]; see also United States ex rel. Hines v. LaVallee (2nd Cir. 1975)\n521 F.2d 1109, 1112-1113 [length of marriage and number of children disclosed to\nofficer in casual conversation was “merely basic identification”]; United States v. Burns\n(2nd Cir. 1982) 684 F.2d 1066, 1075 -1076 (Burns).) [“appellant’s history of drug use,\n\n\n\n\n       27\n          In a similar case, United States v. Williams (D.D.C. 2012) 878 F.Supp.2d 190,\n210, the court found that a question that related “directly to [the defendant’s] connection\nwith evidence of criminal activity” did not fall within the booking exception, even if “the\npolice may not have been fully aware” of the criminal activity of which the defendant\nwas suspected.\n\n\n                                             47\n\fpast record, and personal finances, cannot be characterized as mere pedigree” where they\n“could be incriminating at trial”].)\n       Muniz, like the federal cases that preceded it, recognized a booking exception for\nthe sort of information that is, except in unusual circumstances, not reasonably likely to\nelicit an incriminating response. One’s name, address, date of birth, length of marriage,\nnumber of children seldom relate “even tangentially to a crime.” Nor would they\ngenerally be expected to incriminate a defendant.\n       Here, in contrast, the fact that a suspect in custody is a member of a gang often\ncarries with it penal consequences. This information cannot be characterized as “mere\npedigree” such as a name, address, or birthdate. (Burns, supra, 684 F.2d at p. 1076.) It\n“could be [and was] incriminating at trial” (ibid.) and, as such, is not routine background\ninformation of the sort that has been considered outside the Miranda safeguards. Nor is it\nthe case that a question falls within the booking exception simply because it is routinely\nasked during the booking process. As the court noted in United States v. Williams, supra,\n878 F.Supp.2d at page 210, “the mere timing of the question is insufficient to make it a\nlegitimate booking question.” Nor is it the case that the characterization of this question\nas “administrative” makes it a routine booking question. As the court in Williams\nobserved, “asking Maurice Williams how he had arrived at the police station falls outside\nthe routine identifying questions contemplated by the booking question exception. His\nmode of transportation on that particular day is not a personal identifying characteristic,\nnor was his answer necessary to serve a required property seizure receipt.”\n       United States v. Washington (9th Cir. 2006) 462 F.3d 1124 (Washington) does not\nhold, as the People suggest, that the gathering of gang identification information falls\noutside the scope of Miranda under the routine booking exception. Although\nWashington involved a booking procedure in which that information was requested, the\nchallenged evidence was not a defendant’s self-identification as a gang-member. Rather,\nthe court considered a question that asked defendant for his “gang moniker,” or\nnickname. The court ruled that this question fell within the routine booking exception\nbecause “[q]uestions about a person’s identity are not unconstitutional even if\n\n\n                                             48\n\fidentification of the person may help lead to the prosecution of that person for a crime.”\n(Id. at p. 1133.) Therefore, the court rejected defendant’s contention that his nickname\nshould be suppressed, ruling that such a request “is no different from simply asking for a\nsuspect’s name.” (Ibid.) The question asked Mota was not comparable to the identifying\nquestions the Washington court ruled did not constitute interrogation. Mota was not\nbeing asked to reveal his name when he was asked whether he belonged to a gang. And\ncertainly the fact of gang membership is not “routine” identifying information.\nTherefore, Washington is of no assistance to the People.\n       The People also point out that in People v. Gomez, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th 609,\nthe Fourth District ruled that questions regarding gang affiliation during a booking\ninterview fell within the routine booking exception to Miranda because they were not\ndesigned to elicit an incriminating response. The Gomez court appears to have based its\nconclusion on a footnote in Muniz, in which the court agreed with amicus United States\nthat “ ‘[r]ecognizing a “booking exception” to Miranda does not mean, of course, that\nany question asked during the booking process falls within that exception. Without\nobtaining a waiver of the suspect’s Miranda rights, the police may not ask questions,\neven during booking, that are designed to elicit incriminatory admissions.’ ” (Muniz,\nsupra,496 U.S. at p. 602, fn. 14.)\n       Muniz, however, does not hold that the only type of question asked during booking\nthat falls outside the routine booking exception is one which is “ ‘designed to elicit\nincriminatory admissions.’ ” (Muniz, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 602, fn. 14.) Were this the\ncase, the court’s language regarding questions the police “should know” might elicit an\nincriminating response would be meaningless, given that something an officer “should\nknow” is something he did not, in fact, subjectively know. (Id. at p. 601.) The Gomez\ncourt recognizes that often an officer’s subjective intent is quite relevant to this issue.\nIndeed, it is determinative in those situations in which the officer clearly designed the\nquestion with an interrogative intent. But even if an officer does not intend to elicit an\nincriminating response, and has not designed the question to do so, a question can still\n\n\n\n                                              49\n\fconstitute interrogation subject to the Miranda protections if the officer should have\nknown this question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\n       When answering this question, Mota had two choices. He could either admit to\ngang membership and incriminate himself or he could lie or refuse to answer the question\nand risk physical injury when he was housed with Norteño inmates.28 We know of no\nother case involving the routine booking exception where the defendant was asked to\nchoose between incriminating himself or risking serious physical injury. The price of\nprotecting oneself from harm while in custody should not be incriminating oneself.\n       This is not to say the question cannot or should not be asked. We fully expect the\npolice to continue to use it upon booking in order to protect jail personnel and inmates\nfrom harm. We hold only that the answer to this question may not be used against the\ndefendant at trial, as it was here, in the absence of Miranda warnings.\n       3.     Prejudice\n       The trial court’s error in admitting this testimony was, however, harmless beyond\na reasonable doubt under Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18, because Mota’s\ngang membership was convincingly established by many other sources. Ruelas, Sanchez\nand Menendez all testified that, based on their familiarity with Mota as fellow gang\nmembers and/or friends, Mota was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco. In addition, San\nPablo Police Officer Robert Brady, who testified as an expert oin Norteño and Sureño\ncriminal street gangs, opined that Mota was a gang member. He did so based on\ninformation he had received from other gang members. He also based his opinion on a\n\n       28\n         The trial court specifically found that “[t]here was no threat that if . . . Mr. Mota\ndidn’t answer the questions, that he would be housed with Norteños.” But there was no\nneed to make this threat. It was a fact that if Mota did not answer this question he would\nbe housed with Norteños. As the court found, “Mr. Mota would have every reason to\nmake sure that the deputies knew to house him with Sureños. It would be in Mr. Mota’s\nwholly personal interest in self-preservation that he be classified correctly. And it would\nbe extreme danger to his life if he were not classified correctly and housed with other\nSureños. [¶] So my view is that Mr. Mota would have wanted the deputies to know that\nhe was a Sureño so his life would not be imperiled. And I believe he willingly and\nvoluntarily answered the questions for that reason.”\n\n\n                                              50\n\f2005 robbery Mota had committed in Willows in which Mota wore a blue bandana (the\nSureño color). When he was committed to county jail following his arrest for this\nrobbery, he was observed “throwing up” a hand sign that signified his Sureño status.\nFinally, in photographs taken of Mota at Victor Valencia’s funeral, Mota made similar\ngang signs. Because Mota’s gang affiliation was amply established by evidence other\nthan the statements made by him during booking, any error is harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nH.     Unjoined Perpetrators of Same Crime\n       Defendants argue that the trial court erred in giving the jury CALJIC No. 2.11.5.\nThe instruction is as follows: “There has been evidence in this case indicating that a\nperson other than a defendant was or may have been involved in the crime for which that\ndefendant is on trial. [¶] There may be many reasons why that person is not here on trial.\nTherefore, do not speculate or guess as to why the other person is not being prosecuted in\nthis trial or whether [he] [she] has been or will be prosecuted. Your sole duty is to decide\nwhether the People have proved the guilt of the defendant on trial.” The use note to this\ninstruction states: “Do not use this instruction if the other person is a witness for either\nthe prosecution or the defense.”\n       Defendants argue that this instruction permitted the jury, when evaluating the\ncredibility of the five informant witnesses, to ignore the fact that they were all given deals\nof one kind or another. The issue of whether it was error to give this instruction in a trial\nin which unjoined coperpetrators testified was addressed most recently in People v.\nFonseca (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 543 (Fonseca). In that case, the trial court gave the\n1996 version of CALJIC No. 2.11.529 The court held that this iteration of the instruction\nremoved any\n\n       29\n          The Fonseca court noted that the cases finding it was error to give this\ninstruction in a trial in which an unjoined coperpetrator testified involved earlier versions\nof CALJIC No. 2.11.5. (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 548.) In addition, the\nFonseca court noted that even when there was a finding of error as to the earlier version\nof CALJIC NO. 2.11.5, “in every case where the jury receives all otherwise appropriate\ngeneral instructions regarding witness credibility, there can be no prejudice from jury\n\n                                              51\n\f“lingering possibility that a reasonable juror would misunderstand his or her duty to\nconsider all relevant factors bearing on witness credibility. Therefore, we hold that\nCALJIC No. 2.11.5, in its 1996 version, is not erroneous when given in a trial where an\nunjoined coperpetrator testifies.” (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 550.)\n       The trial court in this case gave the 2004 version of CALJIC No. 2.11.5, which\nwas revised to incorporate the Fonseca court’s suggestion that the “the 1996 instruction\nwould get closer to the heart of the matter if, instead of the italicized words[30] the phrases\n‘speculate upon’ or ‘guess at,’ or words to that effect were substituted.” The jury in this\ncase, therefore, was instructed with a version of CALJIC No. 2.11.5 that would not\nsuggest to a juror that he no longer had a “duty to consider all relevant factors bearing on\nwitness credibility.” (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 550.) We agree with the\nFonseca court’s reasoning regarding this instruction and, therefore, reject defendants’\nargument that the trial court erred in giving it.\nI.     Post-Crime Jail Incidents Used to Establish Gang Membership\n       Several weeks after he was incarcerated, and about a month after the last charged\nhomicide, Mota was involved in an incident in which he and Luii Hernandez attacked\nJorge Sanchez, one of the informants in this case, shortly before the end of “free time” in\nthe Q module, where Sureños are housed. After the fight, Sanchez was separated from\n\n\ninstruction pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.11.5. In other words, the potentially prejudicial\neffect of this instruction in the context of the testifying unjoined coperpetrator lies not in\nthe instruction itself, but in the rather remote possibility that the trial court would fail to\ngive otherwise pertinent and required instructions on the issue of witness credibility. (§\n1127; see also CJER Mandatory Criminal Jury Instructions Handbook (CJER, 11th ed.\n2002) §§ 2.4, 2.96, pp. 13, 76.) There is no error in giving CALJIC No. 2.11.5 so long as\na reasonable juror, considering the whole of his or her charge, would understand that\nevidence of criminal activity by a witness not being prosecuted in the current trial should\nbe considered in assessing the witness's credibility. [Citation.]” (Fonseca, supra, 105\nCal.App.4th at pp. 549-550.) Defendant does not argue that the trial court failed to give\nthese “otherwise pertinent and required instructions on the issue of witness credibility.”\n       30\n         The italicized words to which the court referred were that the jury not “discuss”\nor “give any consideration” as to why the unjoined coperpetrator was not being\nprosecuted in the trial. (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 548.)\n\n\n                                              52\n\fMota and Hernandez and not “let out” with the Sureños again. Eventually, Sanchez\nreached a deal with the prosecutor and entered a witness protection program.\n       Defense counsel sought to have evidence of this fight excluded. The prosecution\nargued that the evidence was admissible to show Mota acted “in concert with other gang\nmembers to accomplish certain goals.” The trial court ultimately admitted evidence of\nthe fight between Sanchez, Mota and Hernandez. It found that the May 24 incident was\n“relevant to Mr. Mota’s gang membership, his conduct and participation in these crimes\non behalf of the gang. So it’s relevant to gang membership and motive and intent for the\ncharged crimes.” He explained that “[Evidence Code section] 1101(b) would permit\nadmission of this . . . because it’s proof of motive and intent.” In addition, “the fact that\nit’s one month later [than the last homicide committed before Mota’s arrest] in my view\nwas not so remote to make it irrelevant.”31\n       Jorge Sanchez testified about the fight.32 According to Sanchez, after he was\narrested, he was placed in the Q module, where Sureños were housed. During free time,\nMota and Hernandez approached him. Mota hit him in the head and Sanchez fought\nback. The deputy maced them and Sanchez got on the floor when the deputy told him to.\nMota did not. Instead, he got on top of Sanchez, who fought back again. After this\nincident, Mota was “rolled up to B module.” He explained that this occurred “just so you\nain’t no good no more.”\n       Sheriff’s Deputy Jesus Garcia testified that on May 24, 2008, he was assigned to\nthe Q Module at the Martinez Detention facility. Mota, Hernandez and Sanchez were let\nout with the other Sureños on the Q Module. Although the Q Module housed “a variety\n       31\n          The court ruled that an admission Mota made after the attack to the effect that\nhe had “done the beatings and that he was still down on Sureños in the sense that he\ncould still be housed with Sureños ” was not admissible because it was not preceded with\nMiranda warnings.\n       32\n          Sanchez testified without objection before the court’s ruling on this issue. Any\nclaim of error with regard to the admission of his testimony has, therefore, been waived.\nIn anticipation of an ineffective assistance of counsel argument, we nevertheless consider\nwhether Sanchez’s testimony, which was similar to that of Deputy Garcia, was\nadmissible.\n\n\n                                              53\n\fof administrative segregation inmates as well as protective custody inmates,” Sureños\nwere let out “alone by themselves.”\n       Mota contends that evidence that he and another Sureño gang member attacked a\nSureño informant while they were in jail was not relevant to the issue of whether he was\nan active participant in a criminal street gang at the time the crimes in this case were\ncommitted because Mota could have joined the Sureños gang after he arrived in prison\nand as a matter of self-preservation or camaraderie. He further argues that the admission\nof this evidence was not permitted under either section 186.22 or the street gang\nenhancement because evidence of post-crime activities cannot be used to show a\nviolation of that statute. Finally, he argues that the admission of this evidence violated\nEvidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), because it was used solely to show his bad\ncharacter. We disagree.\n       “We apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial\ncourt’s ruling on a relevance objection.” (People v. Kipp (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1100, 1123.)\n“ ‘Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency in reason to prove or disprove a disputed\nfact at issue.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 1123.) Evidence of Mota’s participation with\nanother Sureño in an attack on a “snitch” was relevant to the issue of whether he was a\ngang member at the time the murders were committed. The fact that he acted in concert\nwith another gang member was also relevant to the issue of whether in committing the\ncharged crimes he intended to “willfully promote[], further[], or assist[] in any felonious\ncriminal conduct by members of that gang . . . .” (§ 186.22, subd. (a).) The jury could\nreasonably infer from his behavior that both were, in fact, the case.33\n       Mota cites People v. Duran (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1448 (Duran) and People v.\nGodinez (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1363, disappoved on other grounds in People v. Russo\n\n       33\n          Although the fight occurred after the charged crimes, post-crime evidence may\nconstitute circumstantial evidence of a defendant’s intent at the time the charged crimes\nwere committed. (People v. Johnson (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 36, overruled on another ground\nin People v. Rogers (2006) 39 Cal.4th 826, 879 [intent to steal can be proven\ncircumstantially by post-crime actions]; People v. Abilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 508\n[same].)\n\n\n                                             54\n\f(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1124, 1134, for the proposition that “[c]rimes occurring after the\ncharged offense cannot serve as predicate offenses to prove a pattern of criminal gang\nactivity.” (Duran, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at p. 1458.) These cases are of no assistance to\nMota, however, because this evidence was not offered to establish a predicate offense.\nRather it went to whether he was a gang member when the crimes were committed and\nhis intentions in committing these crimes.\n       With regard to Mota’s Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) argument,\n“[c]ase law holds that where evidence of gang activity or membership is important to the\nmotive, it can be introduced even if prejudicial. [Citations.]” (People v. Martin (1994)\n23 Cal.App.4th 76, 81; People v. Olguin (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1369 -1370.)\nGiven that evidence of the circumstances and nature of this fight were directly relevant to\nMota’s motivation for committing the charged crimes, we find no error.\nJ.     Prosecutorial Misconduct\n       1.     Absence of Evidence of Blood in Mota’s Car\n       Menendez testified that, while he was in Mota’s car in mid-April 2008, he shot\nhimself in the leg, causing significant bleeding. About a month later, Mota’s car was\nexamined by the police. This examination yielded no physical evidence to corroborate\nMenendez’s story: no blood, bullets or fingerprints were found. The car contained a\nchild seat and other baby items.\n       Mota’s counsel argued, during closing argument, that because there was no\nevidence of a gun-inflicted injury in Mota’s car, Menendez had lied when he testified\nabout this incident. Specifically, counsel told the jury that Mota’s car “was seized, it was\nsearched, and what was found in the car? Absolutely no blood. Not a single drop of\nblood. [¶] No forensic evidence whatsoever, despite the car’s having been seized and\nthoroughly searched. Not a drop of blood.” Defense counsel went on: “And we all know\nyou can’t clean up blood. And if you try to clean it up, you leave traces of chemicals.”\n       The prosecutor objected on the ground that these were facts not in evidence. The\ntrial court sustained this objection, pointing out that defense counsel’s assertion that an\n\n\n\n                                             55\n\feffort to clean up blood leaves chemical traces, “is not either common knowledge or in\nevidence.”\n       The prosecutor responded to defense counsel’s argument regarding the absence of\nevidence of any blood from Menendez’s self-inflicted wound. He told the jury that after\nMota dropped Menendez off at the hospital, it “makes sense that he [Menendez] went to\ngo clean it.” The court overruled defense counsel’s objection that there was “no evidence\nof that.” The trial court noted that the general rule that “[c]ounsel are permitted to ask\nthat the jury draw inferences from the evidence presented . . . .”\n       Defendants now argue that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he\nsuggested that the reason there was no blood in the back of the car might have been that\nMota cleaned up the blood. We reject this argument.\n       “The applicable federal and state standards regarding prosecutorial misconduct are\nwell established. ‘ “A prosecutor’s . . . intemperate behavior violates the federal\nConstitution when it comprises a pattern of conduct ‘so egregious that it infects the trial\nwith such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.’ ” (People v.\nGionis (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1214; People v. Espinoza (1992) 3 Cal.4th 806, 820.)\nConduct by a prosecutor that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is\nprosecutorial misconduct under state law only if it involves “ ‘ “the use of deceptive or\nreprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury.” ’ ” (People v.\nEspinoza, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 820.)’ (People v. Samayoa (1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 841.)\nRegarding the scope of permissible prosecutorial argument, we recently noted ‘ “ ‘a\nprosecutor is given wide latitude during argument. The argument may be vigorous as\nlong as it amounts to fair comment on the evidence, which can include reasonable\ninferences, or deductions to be drawn therefrom. [Citations.] It is also clear that counsel\nduring summation may state matters not in evidence, but which are common knowledge\nor are illustrations drawn from common experience, history or literature.’ [Citation.] ‘A\nprosecutor may “vigorously argue his case and is not limited to ‘Chesterfieldian\npoliteness’ ” ’ [citation], and he may ‘use appropriate epithets . . . .’ [Citation.]” (People\nv. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 221; People v. Heishman (1988) 45 Cal.3d 147, 195-\n\n\n                                              56\n\f196 (Heishman) [counsel “prohibited from stating or implying facts for which there is no\nevidence before the jury.”].)\n       The defense and the prosecutor presented the jury with different explanations for\nthe lack of evidence of blood in Mota’s car. Neither was implausible. Certainly, when\nthere is an injury, particularly a gunshot wound, one might expect to find blood where the\ninjury occurred. The fact that no blood was found in Mota’s car lends itself to two\ninferences: that Menendez lied when he recounted the incident or Mota cleaned up the\nblood. What is important about both possibilities is that they amount to “ ‘ “fair\ncomment on the evidence, which can include reasonable inferences, or deductions to be\ndrawn therefrom.” ’ ” (People v. Williams, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 221.)\n       Nor is it the case, as defendant argues, that in asking the jury to infer that\nMenendez had cleaned the blood off the seat of his car, the prosecutor stated or implied\nfacts “for which there is no evidence before the jury.” (Heishman, supra, 45 Cal.3d at p.\n195.) In Heishman, our Supreme Court found that the where a prosecutor implied a\nconclusion based on evidence in the record, no misconduct took place. As in Heishman,\nthe prosecutor's argument was based on the facts before the jury—here, the fact that the\ncar was devoid of blood.\n       We also reject defendant’s argument that his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights to a fair trial and due process were violated because the trial court sustained the\nprosecutor’s objection to his statement regarding the chemical byproducts of cleaning up\nthe blood, and overruled his objection in which the prosecutor suggested Menendez had\ncleaned the blood off the seat. The two statements were not “equivalent,” as defendant\ncontends. Nor did the trial court err when it allowed one and not the other.\n       2.     Disparagement of Defense Lawyer During Rebuttal\n       Mota also argues that the prosecutor disparaged his truthfulness and integrity\nduring rebuttal closing argument.\n       In the first alleged instance, the prosecutor told a story his grandfather, a farmer,\ntold about a lawyer who was his neighbor. The farmer observed one day that the rope\ntying the goat in the lawyer’s yard had been chewed through and the farmer’s rose bushes\n\n\n                                              57\n\fhad been eaten. The farmer told the lawyer that the lawyer’s goat had eaten his rose\nbushes. The lawyer told the farmer “It wasn’t my goat. I don’t have a goat. [¶] If I do\nhave a goat, it didn’t eat your roses. [¶] If I do have a goat and it did eat your roses, it’s\nbecause the rose bushes made them eat the roses. [¶] If I do have a goat and it did eat\nyour roses . . . then the goat was insane.”\n       The prosecutor told the jury that this story illustrated that his grandfather “wasn’t\nthat happy that I was going to be a lawyer. And the point is, ladies and gentlemen, what\nare we here for? [¶] Are we here for the truth, or are we here just to throw everything\nout? What did you just hear from the defense for Mr. Mota? [¶] Well, ladies and\ngentlemen, you heard the following things: And it wasn’t stated explicitly to you because\n[defense counsel] didn’t want to come out and say that. [¶] How many defenses are there\nfor Mr. Mota? I don’t get it. My client wasn’t there. He may not have been there for the\n2-16 and 4-26 of ’08 killings. [¶] If my client was there, he didn’t know what these guys\nwere going to do. [¶] If my client was there and he did know what they were doing, and\nit wasn’t self-defense, it was imperfect self-defense so he is only guilty of voluntary\nmanslaughter. [¶] If my client was there and he did know what they were doing and it\nwasn't self-defense or imperfect self-defense, then the bullets fired by Javier Gomez did\nnot actually kill Rico McIntosh because you heard defendant Mota’s attorney cross-\nexamin[e] Mr. Ogan extensively. . . . [¶] If my client was there and he did know what\nthey were doing and it wasn’t self-defense or imperfect self-defense, and you do believe\nthe bullets fired by Gomez actually killed Mr. McIntosh, then my client is only guilty of\nlesser-included offenses that aren’t on the verdict forms, so he is not guilty.”\n       In telling this story, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct. Pointing out the\ninconsistencies and implausibilities of an opponent's argument is not an attack on the\nopponent’s personal integrity. (People v. Medina (1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 759, People v.\nGionis, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218.)\n       Similarly permissible was the prosecutor’s characterization of defense counsel as a\nmagician trying to trick the jury. In People v. Medina, supra, 11 Cal.4th at page 759, the\ncourt found that the prosecutor did not demean defense counsel’s integrity when he told\n\n\n                                              58\n\fthe jury that “ ‘any experienced defense attorney can twist a little, poke a little, try to\ndraw some speculation, try to get you to buy something . . . .’ ” The Medina court\nobserved that “the prosecutor’s . . . argument was unobjectionable. To observe that an\nexperienced defense counsel will attempt to ‘twist’ and ‘poke’ at the prosecution’s case\ndoes not amount to a personal attack on counsel’s integrity.” (See also People v. Gionis,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218.)\n       Accordingly, we find no prosecutorial misconduct and reject defendants'\nargument.\nK.     Substantial Evidence of Murder and Conspiracy\n       Elizalde was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and murder. The People\ncharacterized Elizalde as the conspirator who “stay[ed] home . . . and [did] nothing,\nbut . . . started the design or agree[d] to the conspiracy . . . .” The People told the jury\nthat the testimony of Ruelas, Sanchez and Cervantes showed that Elizalde “was leading a\ncharge to attack rival gang members to bring the hood back.” The People’s theory was\nthat the conspiracy to commit murder in which Mota and Elizalde participated had as its\nobject the killing of rival gang members and the deaths of Centron, Perez and McIntosh\nwere, therefore, the “natural and probable consequences of a conspiracy. . . .”\n       Elizalde now argues that substantial evidence does not establish that the murders\nof Centron, Perez and McIntosh were a foreseeable consequence of a conspiracy in which\nElizalde and Mota participated.34 We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          Elizalde also contends that the only evidence supporting his convictions is the\nuncorroborated testimony of accomplice witnesses. As we have previously held, four of\nthe witnesses who testified regarding Elizalde’s participation in a conspiracy that led to\nthe murders of Centron, Perez and McIntosh were not, in fact, accomplices as a matter of\nlaw. Moreover, viewed in a light most favorable to the verdicts, the jury could have\neasily found that Valencia, Menendez, Cervantes and Ruelas were not accomplices and,\nthus, no corroboration was required. Finally, even if these witnesses were in fact\naccomplices, their testimony was adequately corroborated.\n\n\n                                              59\n\f       1.     General Principles\n       In People v. Johnson (2013) 57 Cal.4th 250, 257, our Supreme Court recently\nexplained that “[s]ection 182 prohibits a conspiracy by two or more people to ‘commit\nany crime.’ (§ 182, subd. (a)(1).) ‘A conviction of conspiracy requires proof that the\ndefendant and another person had the specific intent to agree or conspire to commit an\noffense, as well as the specific intent to commit the elements of that offense, together\nwith proof of the commission of an overt act “by one or more of the parties to such\nagreement” in furtherance of the conspiracy.’ [Citations.]” “[I]it has long been\nestablished that direct evidence is not required to prove a common unlawful design and\nagreement to work toward a common purpose; the existence of a conspiracy may be\ninferred as well from circumstantial evidence. [Citations.]” (People v. Buckman (1960)\n186 Cal.App.2d 38, 46-47; People v. Calhoun (1958) 50 Cal.2d 137, 144.) To the extent\nthat a particular crime could be said to be “unplanned,” a conspirator is responsible for it\nif it was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy. “Whether the\nunplanned act was a ‘reasonably foreseeable consequence’ of the conspiracy must be\n‘evaluated under all the factual circumstances of the individual case’ and ‘is a factual\nissue to be resolved by the jury’ [citation], whose determination is conclusive if\nsupported by substantial evidence.” (People v. Zielesch (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 731,\n739-740.)\n       2.     Substantial Evidence of Conspiracy\n       Our review of the record indicates that substantial evidence supports the jury’s\nconclusion that (1) Elizalde conspired with Mota to reestablish Varrio Frontero Loco by,\namong other things, murdering rival gang members and (2) the deaths of Centron, Perez\nand McIntosh were the natural and probable consequence of that conspiracy.\n       Officer Brady of the San Pablo Police Department testified as a gang expert that in\nlate 2007 and early 2008, Varrio Frontero Loco and the Mexican Locos were beginning\nto “clique up” together. Based on several murders that occurred as well as informant\ninformation, he believed that Gamaliel Elizalde was the “head shot-caller” of Varrio\nFrontero Loco. The gang was recruiting members and committing murders. He believed\n\n\n                                             60\n\fElizalde and other members of Varrio Frontero Loco were attempting to “reestablish the\ngang.”\n         Sanchez testified that in the year leading up to the murders of Centron, Perez and\nMcIntosh, Elizalde was the leader of Varrio Frontero Loco. The gang was on the\ndecline—members were being hurt and territory was disappearing. To counteract this\nstate of affairs, Elizalde, along with Sanchez, Mota, Ruelas, and others, began to recruit\nnew members. They also embarked on a campaign to “do more damage to the\nNorteños.” Elizalde encouraged Varrio Frontero Loco members to make sure that the\nNorteños were aware that they were a present and powerful force by going into Norteño\nterritory to beat up or shoot anyone who appeared to be a Norteño. Menendez confirmed\nthat this was, indeed, the understanding of the Varrio Frontero Loco members who\n“wanted to get rid of Norteños.” Although Menendez was not sure, he believed that\nElizalde was the “shot-caller.” Ruelas confirmed Menendez’s suspicion regarding\nElizalde’s role in the Varrio Frontero Loco. Ruelas also testified that Molina told him\nthat they were “bringing the hood back” and violence against rival gang members was an\nimportant part of this effort.\n         In addition to substantial evidence that Elizalde was a significant player in a\nconspiracy to re-establish Varrio Frontero Loco as a powerful gang through violence—\nincluding murder—against Norteños, substantial evidence also supports the jury’s\nconclusion that the deaths of Centron, Perez and McIntosh were the foreseeable\nconsequence of the conspiracy to “bring[] the hood back.” Centron, Perez and McIntosh\nwere targeted because they appeared to be Norteños, the principal target of the Varrio\nFrontero Loco. Elizalde’s argument that these murders were not foreseeable because the\nvictims were outside Richmond, which was the area claimed by the Sureños, makes little\nsense. San Pablo was well known to be Norteño territory. Given that the Varrio Frontero\nLoco conspired to kill Norteños, they would generally do so in San Pablo, rather than\nRichmond.\n         The jury’s verdict, therefore, is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n                                               61\n\fL.     Telephone Conversations Between Molina and His Mother\n       Elizalde contends that portions of two telephone conversations—mainly between\nHector Molina (who was in jail at the time of the conversations) and his mother—but also\nin one instance involving Elizalde, were improperly admitted under Evidence Code\nsection 1223’s co-conspirator’s hearsay exception. We disagree.\n       1.     Factual Background\n       In the first of the two telephone calls, both of which occurred while he was\nincarcerated at the Martinez Detention Facility, Molina told his mother to contact\nElizalde (Gama) and tell him “that they got me in.” Hector’s mother replied, “[b]ut you\ndidn’t do it, if you didn’t do it!” and he replied “Well, yes, it was me. They already\nknow.” He told his mother to “Tell [Elizalde]. Ask [Elizalde] to help you. [Elizalde]\ncan help you. [Elizalde] will give me money as well. Tell [Elizalde] I’ve told him to\nsend me money.” Molina asked his mother to place a “three way” call to Elizalde. When\nElizalde did not answer, Molina left a message telling Elizalde that “they got me for\nmurder” and that “I need you to take care of my family . . . [t]ake care of my mama . . . .”\n       In the second call, Molina’s mother told him that Elizalde brought her $50. She\nalso told him that Elizalde told her that Molina “should say no, no, no, I didn’t do it, it\ncouldn’t have been me. I didn’t do anything. To keep your word, and no, no, no.”\nMolina’s mother placed another three way call to Elizalde. This time, Elizalde answered.\nHe instructed Molina, “whatever happened, you—you say that you don’t know, okay\nman?” Molina responded, “Yeah, man.” Elizalde then said “On your own, man, no. Just\ntell them no, you don't know and they can’t get you out of that.”\n       Elizalde sought to have evidence of these phone calls excluded on hearsay\ngrounds. The People argued that they were admissible under the co-conspirator\nexception to the hearsay rule pursuant to Evidence Code section 1223. The trial court\nfound that the People had “clearly made a prima facie case that the conspiracy described\nin the indictment existed. That the conspiracy was on-going in February and March of\n2008 at the time of the phone calls. That Mr. Elizalde was a leader of VFL or a shot-\ncaller for VFL and that Mr. Mota was a member of the conspiracy. And that Mr. Gomez\n\n\n                                              62\n\fwas also a member of the conspiracy.” The court pointed out that Gomez’s confession\n“can be considered as part of the prima facie case of his membership in the conspiracy.”\nAs Sureños, the “co-conspirators lived under a number of rules that are relevant to this\nanalysis. [¶] First, is never cooperate with police. Never give a confession. Never give a\nstatement. Never agree to testify. If you are arrested, fellow gang members will put\nmoney on your books to help you buy things in the jail which enables you to be more\ncomfortable and to increase your influence at the jail. [¶] The Sureños in the jail were\nrequired to contribute money or buy things for other Sureños in custody. And then\nSureños in custody were still required to assault Norteños at every opportunity. [¶] So\nthe culture of attacking rival gang members did not stop upon arrest.”\n       The court found that Molina was released following his arrest after the Centron\nmurder and “within days” he “immediately returned to the active participation in the\nconspiracy. Just an indication that mere arrests [of conspiracy members] does not\nnecessarily put their participation in the conspiracy at end.” The court did, however,\nredact numerous telephone conversations in which Molina was “talking about his general\nwelfare and that sort of thing.”\n       2.     Discussion\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found that the conspiracy was\nongoing. He contends that because Molina had already been arrested when the telephone\ncalls were made, the court could not conclude that he was involved in an ongoing\nconspiracy.\n       We review the trial court’s ruling under the abuse of discretion standard and will\nnot disturb it on appeal unless it was exercised in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor patently absurd and that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (People v. Rowland\n(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 264.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nexcerpts from these telephone calls.\n       Evidence Code section 1223 provides that “a statement offered against a party is\nnot made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if: [¶] (a) The statement was made by the\ndeclarant while participating in a conspiracy to commit a crime or civil wrong and in\n\n\n                                             63\n\ffurtherance of the objective of that conspiracy; [¶] (b) The statement was made prior to\nor during the time that the party was participating in that conspiracy; and [¶] (c) The\nevidence is offered either after admission of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the\nfacts specified in subdivisions (a) and (b) or, in the court’s discretion as to the order of\nproof, subject to the admission of such evidence.”\n       As the proponent of the evidence, the People were required to “offer evidence\nsufficient for the trier of fact to determine that the preliminary fact, the conspiracy, is\nmore likely than not to have existed.” (People v. Herrera (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 46, 61.)\nThe Herrera court explains that “[a] conspiracy exists when one or more persons have\nthe specific intent to agree or conspire to commit an offense, as well as the specific intent\nto commit the elements of that offense, together with proof of the commission of an overt\nact by one or more of the parties to such agreement in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n[Citations.] These facts may be established through the use of circumstantial evidence.\n[Citations.] They may also ‘ “be inferred from the conduct, relationship, interests, and\nactivities of the alleged conspirators before and during the alleged conspiracy.\n[Citations.]” ’ [Citations.] [¶] Once the existence of the conspiracy has been\nindependently established, the offering party must then make three additional showings in\norder for the content of the coconspirator’s statement to be considered by the trier of fact.\nThat party must show: (1) that the declarant (who may or may not be the defendant) was\nparticipating in a conspiracy at the time of the declaration; (2) that the declaration was\nmade in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy; and (3) that at the time of the\ndeclaration the party against whom the evidence is offered was participating, or would\nlater participate, in the conspiracy. [Citations.]” (Id. at pp. 64-65.)\n       We turn now to this case. The court had before it evidence that when the telephone\ncalls were made—in February and March of 2008—Elizalde, who was not in custody at\nthe time, was the shot caller for Varrio Frontero Loco. Even in custody, a Sureño like\nMolina adhered to rules of behavior established by the gang. As the trial court put it:\n“First, is never cooperate with police. Never give a confession. Never give a statement.\nNever agree to testify. If you are arrested, fellow gang members will put money on your\n\n\n                                              64\n\fbooks to help you buy things in the jail which enables you to be more comfortable and to\nincrease your influence at the jail. [¶] The Sureños in the jail were required to contribute\nmoney or to buy things for other Sureños in custody.” Contrary to defendant’s argument\nthat the conspiracy among the parties to attack Norteños ended when Molina was\narrested, the court found that “Sureños in custody were still required to assault Norteños\nat every opportunity. [¶] So the culture of attacking rival gang members did not stop\nupon arrest.” In fact, when Molina was released following his arrest after the Centron\nmurder, “within days” he “immediately returned to the active participation in the\nconspiracy. Just an indication that mere arrests [of conspiracy members] does not\nnecessarily put their participation in the conspiracy at end.”\n       This evidence was sufficient to support a finding that it was more likely than not\nthat Molina and Elizalde were participants in a conspiracy when the telephone calls were\nmade and, therefore, the telephone calls were properly admitted.\nM.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n       The short answer to Elizalde’s argument that counsel was deficient for failing to\nobject to the admission of these telephone calls is that because (as we previously found)\nthis evidence was admissible, any objection would have been unavailing and, thus, the\nfailure to object did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. (People v. Frye\n(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 952, overruled on other grounds by People v. Doolin (2009) 45\nCal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22.)\nN.     Ruelas’s MySpace Post\n       Luis Ruelas testified that he posted a message on his MySpace page in order to\nwarn gang members not to harm his family. The gist of the message was that if gang\nmembers “touch my family their family can be touched, too.” The post read as follows:\n“but dis goes to all da lil homies, stop listening to da big homies, they dnt give a fuck\nbout ya lil niggas, dnt listen to Stranger, dat nigga is a nobody in VFL. Just cus hes close\nto Gama dnt mean shit. He never did no, jales . . . and Gama just uses ya to take care of\nhis shit. He dnt give a fuck bout ya.” He posted that the true members of VFL were\n\n\n\n                                             65\n\f“Sleepy, Richy, Toby, Ruelas, Camacho, all da other VFLs except da pee wees are\nfucken suckas niggas.”\n       The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.13 that “[t]he\nrequired corroboration of the testimony of an accomplice may not be supplied by the\ntestimony of any or all of his accomplices, but must come from other evidence.” Elizalde\nargues that the instruction was incorrect because the jury could have understood it to\nmean that Ruelas’s accomplice testimony could be corroborated by his MySpace post\nbecause that post might be considered “non-testimonial.”\n       Even if Elizalde had not forfeited this claim because he did not object or request a\nmodification to the instruction, his claim is without merit. We do not agree that the\ninstruction could be construed as permitting the jury to use the MySpace post as\ncorroboration. The language of the instruction is broad enough to encompass this\nparticular communication. The instruction, therefore, did not violate his Sixth\nAmendment right to make a defense. (Estelle v. McGuire (1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72.)\nO.     Elizalde’s 2007 Methamphetamine Incident\n       As part of its showing of a predicate offense for the gang charge and gang\nenhancements, the People put in evidence of an incident involving Elizalde’s 2007\npossession of methamphetamine for sale. Elizalde objected to the admission of this\nevidence under Evidence Code section 352. He argued then, as he does now on appeal,\nthat the evidence was cumulative and more prejudicial than probative. The trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.\n       At trial, two police officers testified that they searched Elizalde’s home on July 18,\n2007. During that search, the officers discovered a trail of white crystals, which were\nlater identified as methamphetamine, leading from a bathroom to where Elizalde was\nstanding. In addition, the officers found the same white crystals around the top of the\ntoilet bowl rim, on the floor of the bathroom, and on Elizalde’s abdomen. The officers\nalso found indicia that Elizalde was selling drugs. These included small Ziploc baggies, a\ndigital scale, $755 cash in Elizalde’s pocket and “pay/owe” sheets. One of the officers,\nwho was qualified as an expert on the possession of narcotics for sale testified that in his\n\n\n                                             66\n\fopinion Elizalde possessed methamphetamine for sale and flushed it down the toilet.\nElizalde was arrested for possession of narcotics for sale and ultimately was convicted of\nonly possession.\n       The trial court admitted evidence of Elizalde’s conduct on this occasion to meet\nthe predicate crime requirements, finding that “the probative value is very high because\nthey are legitimate proof of essential elements of the crime and enhancements.” With\nregard to the prejudicial effect of this evidence, the court found that although the\nprejudicial effect of the evidence was substantial, a limiting instruction could mitigate\nthat effect.35\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence. Our\nSupreme Court recently considered a similar objection to gang evidence admitted to\nprove a predicate offense under section 186.22. The court explained that, in contrast to\nevidence admitted under Evidence Code section 1101 to show intent, motive or modus\noperandi, in which “ ‘evidence is probative because of its tendency to establish an\nintermediary fact from which the ultimate fact of guilt of a charged crime may be\ninferred. [Citations.]’ In prosecutions for active participation in a criminal street gang,\nthe probative value of evidence of a defendants gang-related separate offense generally is\ngreater because it provides direct proof of several ultimate facts necessary to a\nconviction. Thus, that the defendant committed a gang-related offense on a separate\noccasion provides direct evidence of a predicate offense, that the defendant actively\nparticipated in the criminal street gang, and that the defendant knew the gang engaged in\na pattern of criminal gang activity.” (People v. Tran (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1040, 1048.) Not\n\n       35\n          The court did indeed give the jury limiting instructions regarding this evidence.\nAfter the two officers who searched Elizalde’s house testified, the court instructed the\njury that their testimony regarding Elizalde’s possession of methamphetamine for sale\nwas admissible only with regard to the gang count and gang enhancements. The court\nwarned the jury that the evidence was “not admissible to suggest the Mr. Elizalde . . . has\na bad character or a propensity to commit crimes, buy only on the predicate act elements\nof the gang charge and the gang enhancements . . . .” At the end of the trial, the court\ninstructed the jury on the use of evidence that was admitted for a limited purpose\n(CALJIC No. 2.09) and evidence of other crimes (CALJIC No. 2.50).\n\n\n                                             67\n\fonly is such evidence highly probative, but its prejudicial effect is comparatively weaker:\n“[T]he inherent prejudice from a defendant’s separate gang-related offense typically will\nbe less when the evidence is admitted to establish a predicate offense in a prosecution for\nactive participation in a criminal street gang, than when it is admitted to establish an\nintermediary fact from which guilt may be inferred. ‘Prejudice for purposes of Evidence\nCode section 352 means evidence that tends to evoke an emotional bias against the\ndefendant with very little effect on issues, not evidence that is probative of a defendant’s\nguilt.’ [Citations.] As we explained in People v. Doolin (2009) 45 Cal.4th 390: ‘ “The\nprejudice that section 352 ‘ “is designed to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a\ndefense that naturally flows from relevant, highly probative evidence.” [Citations.]\n“Rather, the statute uses the word in its etymological sense of ‘prejudging’ a person or\ncause on the basis of extraneous factors.” ’ ” ’ (Id. at p. 439.) That the evidence\nprovided direct evidence of some of the elements of the prosecution’s case thus does not\nweigh against its admission. In addition, because the prosecution is required to establish\nthe defendant was an active participant in a criminal street gang and had knowledge of\nthe gang’s criminal activities, the jury inevitably and necessarily will in any event receive\nevidence tending to show the defendant actively supported the street gang’s criminal\nactivities. That the defendant was personally involved in some of those activities\ntypically will not so increase the prejudicial nature of the evidence as to unfairly bias the\njury against the defendant. In short, the use of evidence of a defendant’s separate offense\nto prove a predicate offense should not generally create ‘an intolerable “risk to the\nfairness of the proceedings or the reliability of the outcome.” ’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nTran, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1048.)\n       The Tran court also addressed the contention Elizalde makes that evidence of his\npossession of narcotics for sale was cumulative of the evidence of other predicate\noffenses offered by the prosecution. “Defendant argues that evidence of a defendant’s\nseparate offense on another occasion should not be admitted when it is ‘cumulative.’ By\nthis he seems to mean that the evidence should not be admitted when the prosecution has\nthe ability to develop evidence of offenses committed on separate occasions by other\n\n\n                                             68\n\fgang members. But defendant cites no authority for the argument that the prosecution\nmust forgo the use of relevant, persuasive evidence to prove an element of a crime\nbecause the element might also be established through other evidence. The prejudicial\neffect of evidence defendant committed a separate offense may, of course, outweigh its\nprobative value if it is merely cumulative regarding an issue not reasonably subject to\ndispute. [Citations.] But the prosecution cannot be compelled to ‘ “present its case in the\nsanitized fashion suggested by the defense.” ’ [Citation.] When the evidence has\nprobative value, and the potential for prejudice resulting from its admission is within\ntolerable limits, it is not unduly prejudicial and its admission is not an abuse of discretion.\nFurther, a rule requiring exclusion of evidence of a defendant’s separate offense on the\ntheory the prosecution might be able to produce evidence of offenses committed by other\ngang members would unreasonably favor defendants belonging to large gangs with a\nsubstantial history of criminality. That the prosecution might be able to develop evidence\nof predicate offenses committed by other gang members therefore does not require\nexclusion of evidence of a defendant’s own separate offense to show a pattern of criminal\ngang activity.” (People v. Tran, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp.1048-1049.)\n       In our view, the evidence of Elizalde’s conduct on this occasion was not so\nprejudicial as to preclude its admission. The jury had before it evidence of numerous acts\nof violence committed by Elizalde and, in that context, evidence that he possessed\nmethamphetamine for sale can hardly be considered sufficiently prejudicial to outweigh\nits substantial probative value.\nP.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel For Failure to Object to “Other Crimes”\n       Evidence\n       Elizalde argues that counsel was ineffective because he did not object to the\nintroduction of evidence of Elizalde’s role in a number of crimes. He contends that this\nevidence was “devastating,” and therefore counsel’s failure to object violated the Sixth\nAmendment.\n       The evidence to which counsel did not object was: (1) testimony that Elizalde\ndirected Sanchez and Ruelas to kill a surviving witness to the Centron shootings; (2)\n\n\n                                              69\n\fevidence that “Weasal” who was a Varrio Frontero Loco shot caller from prison ordered\nElizalde to kill an informant and that although Elizalde did not want to do so, he sent\nsomeone to burn the informant’s house down; (3) the fact that Elizalde kept a hit list of\npeople whom he wanted killed and kept a stash of guns at his brother-in-law’s house; (4)\nRuelas’s description of an incident in which Elizalde asked Ruelas to kill someone who\nhad slashed his tires; and (5) Ruelas’s opinion that Elizalde was killing people “for no\nreason” and that he tried to persuade Elizalde to stop ordering so many shootings.\n       This evidence was highly relevant to establish Elizalde's position as the Varrio\nFrontero Loco shot caller and his participation in the conspiracy to kill Norteños.\nMoreover, given the amount of evidence of similar activity on Elizalde’s part it was not\nmore prejudicial than probative under Evidence Code section 352. Any objection\ncounsel might have made regarding the admission of this evidence would have been\nunavailing. In that case, the failure to object does not constitute ineffective assistance of\ncounsel. (People v. Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 952.)\nQ.     Cumulative Error (Elizalde)\n       Elizalde contends cumulative error in this case rises to the level of reversible and\nprejudicial error. (People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 844, overruled on another ground\nin Price v. Superior Court (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1046, 1069, fn. 13.) We disagree. The\nsingle error in this matter regarding the admission of Mota's booking statement cannot\namount to cumulative error because, along with being the sole error in this case, it was\nharmless.\n                                    IV.

INTRODUCTION\n        This case involves four victims: Antonio Centron, Luis Perez, Lisa Thayer and\nRico McIntosh. Defendant Javier Gomez was found guilty of the second degree murder\nof McIntosh and the jury found true enhancements for participating in a criminal street\ngang and intentionally discharging a firearm causing bodily injury or death. A second\njury found defendants Mota and Elizalde1, guilty of the first degree murder of Centron,\nPerez and McIntosh and came back with an acquittal as to Lisa Thayer. The jury also\nfound Mota and Elizalde guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, participating in a\ncriminal street gang and found true enhancements for participating in a criminal street\ngang. As to Mota, the jury found true an enhancement for intentionally discharging a\nfirearm causing great bodily injury or death. Elizalde was also found guilty of dissuading\na witness by force or threat of force.\n\n        1\n        Because Gomez confessed to one of the murders and implicated Mota, the court\nordered a single trial with two juries: one jury for Gomez and the second jury for Mota\nand Elizalde.\n\n\n                                                         1\n\f         On appeal, Gomez argues that (1) the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct\nthe jury that an unforeseeable supervening cause might have caused Rico McIntosh’s\ndeath (Elizalde and Mota join in this argument); (2) the trial court did not properly\nanswer the jury’s questions regarding the elements of second degree murder (Elizalde\njoins in this argument); (3) the trial court erred in permitting testimony regarding threats\nto witnesses (Elizalde and Mota join in this argument); and (4) the trial court erred when\nit failed to instruct the jury that witness Oscar Menendez was an accomplice as a matter\nof law (Elizalde and Mota join in this argument).\n         Mota argues that the trial court erred when it (1) found that there was no prima\nfacie case of discrimination with regard to an African-American prospective juror\n(Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); (2) gave the jury the task of determining\nwhether four witnesses were accomplices (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); (3)\nadmitted into evidence a statement Mota made during booking regarding his gang\naffiliation (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); (4) instructed the jury not to\nspeculate about why unjoined perpetrators were not tried in the same trial (Gomez and\nElizalde join in this argument); and (5) admitted evidence that Mota attacked Jorge\nSanchez in jail (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument). He also argues that (6)\nduring his rebuttal to the defense’s closing argument, the prosecutor committed\nmisconduct (Gomez and Elizalde join in this argument); and (7) there was cumulative\nerror.\n         Elizalde contends on appeal that (1) there is not substantial evidence to support the\njury’s conspiracy finding (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); (2) the trial court\nfailed in admitting phone calls between Hector Molina and his mother under the co-\nconspirator exception to the hearsay rule (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); (3)\ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek redaction of a statement Elizalde made to\nMolina’s mother during one of these jail calls; (4) the trial court erred when it instructed\nthe jury, pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.13, that the required corroboration of the testimony of\nan accomplice may not be supplied by the testimony of any other accomplice (Gomez\nand Mota join in this argument); (5) the trial court erred when it admitted evidence that\n\n\n                                               2\n\fElizalde possessed methamphetamine for sale to prove a predicate offense for the gang\ncharge and enhancements (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); (6) counsel was\nineffective for failing to object to other crimes evidence regarding the conspiracy to\ncommit murders (Gomez and Mota join in this argument); and (7) there was cumulative\nerror.\n         With the exception of the admission of Mota’s un-Mirandized2 statements made\nwhen he was booked into jail, an error that was not prejudicial, we find no other error and\naffirm the judgments.\n                   II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.       The Murders\n         Defendants Mota and Elizalde were convicted of three murders that occurred over\na four-month period between December 22, 2007, and April 25, 2008. Gomez was\nconvicted of one of the three, that of Rico McIntosh. The most significant testimony\nregarding these murders came from fellow gang members and/or friends, Jorge Sanchez\n(Centron murder), Victor Cervantes (Centron murder), Oscar Menendez (McIntosh\nmurder), and Larry Valencia (Perez murder).\n         1.       Antonio Centron Murder\n         Jorge Sanchez testified that in exchange for his testimony he pled to accessory\nafter the fact to murder, and received a three-year suspended sentence. Sanchez, who\nwas not in the country legally, also had a “parole in place” arrangement with Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement and, as a result, wore an ankle bracelet monitor. Sanchez\ntestified that he was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco3, a subset of the Sureño gang,\nwhich is active in Contra Costa County.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n             Miranda v. Arizona (1966) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miranda).\n         3\n          As one of the prosecution witnesses explained, Varrio Frontero Loco “just stands\nfor it’s a hood, you know, no matter from where country you are from, you are in the\nhood.”\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       The evening of December 22, 2007, Francisco Romero , who was also a Varrio\nFrontero Loco, gathered together a number of people and went to North Richmond.4\nWhen he arrived, Molina phoned defendant Gamaliel (Gama) Elizalde5 “because\nsupposedly he was going to put a meeting to go up there, just fight them [the Richmond\nSur Trace members].” After speaking to Romero, Elizalde came to North Richmond.\nElizalde then tried to call a Richmond Sur Trace member in order to arrange a fight but\nwas not able to reach anyone.\n       After the failed effort to engage the Richmond Sur Trace, Sanchez, Romero and\nMolina eventually drove to the Broadway area of San Pablo, which was known to be\nNorteño territory. Sanchez understood that if they found Norteños there they would beat\nthem up or shoot them. He understood this “was part of the deal of being a . . . [Varrio\nFrontero Loco] Sureño at this time.”\n       That same evening, the victim, Antonio Centron, along with two friends, Neil\nWixson and Adrian Espinoza, attended a party in the Broadway area of San Pablo. They\nstayed at the party for a couple of hours and then walked down Lake Street, toward 19th\nStreet to buy beer. This area of San Pablo was a stronghold of the Norteño gang.\nWixson and Centron wore red shirts, a color associated with Norteños. Centron walked a\nlittle ahead of his friends.\n       Romero drove by Centron, Wixson and Espinoza. Molina, who was in the right\nfront passenger seat, told Romero he knew one of the three men. Molina pulled out a\nhandgun and directed Romero to park down the next street. Romero parked and Molina\nran out, and hid behind a fence, waiting for Centron, Wixson and Espinoza to come to the\ncorner. When they did, Molina told them he was “VFL” and emptied his gun in their\n\n       4\n        Preceding this gathering, there had been altercations between members of Varrio\nFrontero Loco and another Sureño gang called Richmond Sur Trace as well as with rival\nNorteño gang members.\n       5\n         We identify the witnesses, victims, defendants and other participants in this trial\nby their full names rather than their gang nicknames. Where necessary for clarification,\nwe will indicate the full name of any person identified in testimony solely by his gang\nnickname.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fdirection. His first shot hit Centron in the head. Centron died almost immediately. Nine\nmore shots hit Espinoza in the back. Molina’s final shot hit Wixon in the arm. Espinoza,\nwho was still conscious (and ultimately survived his injuries) called 911.\n       After killing and wounding the men he believed were rival gang members, Molina\nran back to the car and they sped off. In the car, Molina was jumpy and excited.\nAccording to Sanchez, Molina said “to watch the newspaper. That’s—that was going to\nbe his trophy.” A newspaper article about a killing was “[l]ike a signature that you did\nit.” The killing would give Molina “more respect” in the gang. Molina called Elizalde to\ntell him what he’d done. Elizalde arrived “and just started telling him just be quiet, stop,\nyou know, screaming and just lay low.”\n       The next day, the police detained and searched Molina. They found in his\npossession a .45 caliber chrome Colt semiautomatic handgun, a blue bandana, and a blue\nbaseball hat. The police arrested him and charged him with possession of a concealed\nfirearm. Molina was released from jail four days later.\n       Victor Cervantes testified that right after Molina got out of jail, he called\nCervantes and asked for a ride home. Molina told him that he’d killed one man and\nanother was in a coma. He also told Cervantes that he’d been with Francisco Romero\nwhen he’d killed the man. Cervantes asked him how he got out of jail when he’d been\ncaught with a gun. Molina told him that he got caught with a different gun than the one\nused in the killing and, as a result, he had gotten away with murder.\n       In an interview with the police, Luis Ruelas testified that Molina admitted to him\nthat he was in the car with Romero and Sanchez that evening and that Molina said he had\nshot at three men and killed one of them.\n       Defendants Elizalde and Mota were found guilty of Centron’s murder as co-\nconspirators.\n       2.       Luis Perez Murder\n       Larry Valencia was one of the prosecution’s main witnesses with regard to the\nmurder of Luis Perez. Valencia had not made a plea bargain with the District Attorney’s\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\foffice, nor was he receiving any witness protection or money from the District Attorney’s\noffice.\n          Valencia testified that late on the night of February 16, 2008, he decided to visit\nfriends in North Richmond. After an evening of drinking beer, smoking marijuana and\ntaking Ecstasy someone said, “[l]et’s jump for a ride. Let’s go find some females to\nparty.” Hector Molina, Jorge Camacho, and Jose Mota got into Mota’s black, two-door\nKia. Molina sat in the driver’s seat, with Jorge Camacho next to him in the passenger\nseat and Mota in the back. Cole Azamar and Luii Hernandez got into Azamar’s car, with\nAzamar driving and Hernandez sitting in the passenger seat. All five men were members\nof Varrio Frontero Loco. They encouraged Larry Valencia (who testified that he was not\na gang member) to join them and he got into the back seat of Azamar’s car. After the two\ncars drove around for a while, with Azamar following Molina, they arrived in San Pablo.\nValencia was aware that this was Norteño territory.\n          Molina stopped the car and Valencia saw the people in Mota’s car arguing with a\nman in a red jacket—the victim, Luis Perez—who was standing next to the car. He saw\nCamacho get out of the car and say to the man, “[s]how me your hands, show me your\nhands.” The man yelled “[w]hat the fuck is going on?” Valencia heard three loud shots\nand saw Camacho shoot the man three or four times. In fact, Camacho hit Perez seven\ntimes: two bullets to the abdomen, two to the back and three to the back of his arms. The\nbullets passed through Perez’s lungs, heart and liver. Perez died en route to John Muir\nHospital in Walnut Creek.\n          Camacho got back into the car with Molina and Mota and Molina drove away.\nValencia had never seen anyone killed before. Valencia told Azamar to take him back to\nhis car so he could go home.\n          Mota was found guilty of Perez’s murder on an aider and abettor theory. Elizalde\nwas found guilty as a co-conspirator.\n          3.     Lisa Thayer\n          The third victim, Lisa Thayer, died when Jorge Camacho, a member of Varrio\nFrontero Loco, exchanged shots with several unidentified men in a Toyota minivan.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       This altercation began late in the afternoon of February 27, 2008. Camacho and\nhis friend Antonio Solomon, were walking on San Pablo Avenue in San Pablo.6 Solomon\nwas wearing a New York Yankees hat. In that area, that kind of hat was understood to\nstand for “Young Narfer,” a reference to North Richmond, which was Sureño territory.\n       A burgundy Toyota minivan with a Hispanic driver and front seat passenger and\nAfrican-American passenger in the back seat passed Solomon and Camacho. Solomon\nand Camacho ran.\n       The men in the minivan chased them. Eventually, the minivan pulled up behind\nSolomon and Camacho. The side door opened, revealing that the back seat passenger had\na gun. Camacho shot at the van with the same 9 mm semiautomatic handgun he used to\nkill Perez. He fired nine times. The man in the van also fired a .40 caliber semiautomatic\nhandgun several times.\n       Lisa Thayer, who was walking on San Pablo about half a block from the shooting,\nwas hit by a bullet. The bullet hit her in the back, went through her right lung and came\nout at her chest. Thayer died soon afterwards.\n       Solomon and Camacho ran from the scene with the van following them. Someone\nin the van fired several more shots at them. Soloman and Camacho climbed a fence and\nran to the apartment of a friend—Ignacio Mendoza. When Mendoza’s mother told them\nto leave, Camacho gave his gun to Mendoza and left with Solomon. The police arrived\nnearby, a witness pointed them out and they were arrested. Camacho had a blue bandana\nin his pocket.\n       The jury found defendants Mota and Elizalde not guilty of Thayer’s murder.\n       4.        Rico McIntosh\n       The fourth shooting occurred in the early morning hours of April 26, 2008. Oscar\nMenendez, who was present at the shooting, testified that he had pleaded to accessory to\nthe murder of McIntosh with a gang enhancement. He was given three years probation.\n\n\n       6\n      Much of the evidence regarding this incident came from an interview between\nSolomon and the police.\n\n\n                                            7\n\fAs a condition of his plea, he agreed to testify in court. At the time he testified he was in\n“parole in place,” which meant he wore an ankle monitor required by Immigrations,\nCustoms and Enforcement. The People were assisting him in obtaining a work permit.\nMenendez had not violated any of the terms of his probation or the terms and conditions\nimposed by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement. He did not receive any money from\nthe District Attorney’s office.\n       Menendez testified that he had known Mota for several years. Mota was a\nmember of Varrio Frontero Loco. Menendez also knew Javier Gomez. The three of\nthem hung out together and “sometimes we used to get in the car and just cruise around.”\nGomez belonged to a Sureño subset called Mexican Loco.7 Menendez had been at\nparties where members of the two Sureño subsets would brag “about crimes they have\ndone during the week or, you know, any stuff that they doing, you know, like beating\nsomebody up or robbing people or whatever crimes they do, they used to brag about all\nof the time.” Six months before the McIntosh murder, Menendez became a Sureño.\n       Menendez described an incident that occurred about a week and a half before the\nMcIntosh murder. He, Gomez and Mota went to visit Gomez’s cousin who lived in\nMontalvin, which was Norteño territory. Mota drove his Kia, and Gomez sat in the front\npassenger seat. Menendez sat in the back. The cousin wasn’t home, so they turned\naround to return to Richmond. As they did so, Gomez and Mota saw a man wearing red\nwho was fixing his car. Mota and Gomez “said he was a Buster. He was wearing\nred . . . .” Menendez didn’t agree and when he saw that Gomez and Mota had a gun8 in\nthe front seat he told them to drop the gun. Menendez tried to grab the gun and in the\nensuing scuffle, someone shot Menendez in the leg.\n\n\n       7\n        During a search of Gomez’s home, the police collected evidence of Gomez’s\ngang membership—four CD cases with “Sureño-type titles on them,” “six individual CDs\nwith Sureño-type titles,” “[a]nother CD . . . again, with Sureño-type titles,” “[t]wo blue\nbandanas.”\n       8\n         Menendez had found this gun earlier, but he gave it to Mota when Mota told him\nthat he (Menendez) couldn’t shoot it and “might as well just give it to him . . . .”\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       Menendez was bleeding heavily, so Mota and Gomez took him to the hospital.\nThe police questioned Menendez and he lied and told them that they had been jumped\nand he had been shot in the leg because he told his assailants that he didn’t have any\nmoney.\n       Several weeks later, Gomez and Mota pulled up to where Menendez was hanging\nout with some friends and “they were calling me, right, and I went to the car and they say\nget in the car. I was like where are you guys going? They said don’t trip.” As on the\nother occasion, Mota was driving and Gomez was in the front passenger seat. Menendez\nasked if his friend could go too, and Mota told him he couldn’t. Menendez got in the car\nand they decided to go to a McDonald’s on San Pablo near Broadway. Instead of turning\nright into the McDonald’s, however, Mota turned left onto Broadway. Menendez asked\nMota were he was going and he said “don’t trip.” Mota kept driving. At this point, they\nwere driving into Norteño territory and Menendez thought “they were looking for some\nNorteños . . . or they were trying to do something again.”\n       Gomez spotted three men wearing red at a stop sign. Mota stopped the car and\nasked the men if they were “busters.” The men said they weren't, and Menendez\nrecognized one of them and told Mota that “they don’t bang . . . .” Mota drove away but\n“he kept on mugging9 them.”\n       Mota then spotted Rico McIntosh, who looked, to Menendez, like he was wearing\na red bandana and had some “red on his pants, too.” Mota and Gomez thought he looked\nlike a Norteño. They pulled alongside McIntosh and Gomez asked him “if he is a\nbuster.” McIntosh said “what the fuck is a buster?” Menendez thought he heard Mota\nsay “pull it out.” He then saw Gomez reach down toward his leg. McIntosh made a\ngesture as though to reach for something and Menendez thought it was a gun. Gomez\nbegan to fire the gun out of the window of the car. Menendez heard four or five shots.\nMcIntosh fell and Mota and Gomez began to laugh. Menendez told them it wasn't funny\nand they told him he was a “pussy.” Menendez said he wanted to go home. “I told them\n\n       9\n           Menendez defined “mugging” as “like he look hellabad at him.”\n\n\n                                             9\n\fwhat they just did, it was wrong because I never seen somebody kill another person like\nthat.”\n         Mota and Gomez “seemed pretty happy, like they just won the lottery or\nsomething. They were really excited about it.” Mota and Gomez wanted to celebrate,\nbut Menendez asked to go home. On the way, Mota and Gomez talked and said, “Oh,\nyou know, what the homies are going to say when they find out, or was he good, was he\nbad, you know they were saying that it was like, you know, it was like perfect. Perfect is\nno one sees them. [¶] No one seen us when we were there. When that happened there\nwas no people at all, just that guy.”\n         When they arrived at Menendez’s house, Mota left the gun with Menendez. He\ntold Menendez that he was on parole and couldn’t have it.\n         A week or so later, Menendez went to a party with members of Varrio Frontero\nLoco and Mexican Loco. At the party, Gomez “started talking about it.” Ruelas was also\npresent, along with a number of other Varrio Frontero Loco and Mexican Loco. Mota\nwas also there.\n         Gomez confessed to the McIntosh murder. He told the police that Mota picked\nhim up the night of the murder and the two of them went to look for Norteños. Mota\ngave him the gun he used to shoot Rico McIntosh. Mota’s job was to drive until he saw a\nNorteño and then stop. Gomez didn’t plan to shoot anyone who wasn’t a Norteño. After\ndriving around for a while Mota and Gomez picked up Menendez. Menendez sat in the\nback seat. They continued to look for Norteños, slowing down to look and then ruling\nout a number of groups of people who were out that night. Eventually, either Mota or\nMenendez spotted McIntosh, who was walking down the street. Mota told him that\nMcIntosh had some red on. Gomez “asked him, are you a Buster? And he said, what the\nfuck is a buster? He, he had a hoodie. Then he like, he pulled the hoodie down as if he\nwanted to do something, so I just shot him.” He shot McIntosh until there were no\nbullets left in his gun.\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       After the shooting they went to a store and bought some beer and drank it at the\ncemetery. He gave the gun to Menendez. Menendez saw the whole thing from the\nbackseat.\n       McIntosh was hit in the hip and buttocks. He was taken to John Muir Hospital and\nreleased on April 28, 2008. The next day, McIntosh collapsed and died after blood clots\ncaused by the gunshot wounds traveled to his lungs.\n       Gomez was convicted of second degree murder. Mota was convicted of first\ndegree murder as an aider and abettor and Elizalde was convicted as a co-conspirator.\nB.     Conspiracy and Gang Evidence\n       Several witnesses testified to a conspiracy on the part of Mota and Elizalde to\ncommit murders of rival Norteño gang members in order to restore the reputation and\nfortunes of the Varrio Frontero Loco.\n       1.     Jorge Sanchez\n       Jorge Sanchez was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco.10 He joined because his\nolder brother was in the gang. Sanchez’s brother was a member of the Mexican Loco,\nanother Sureño gang, and he joined the Varrio Frontero Loco because he wanted his own\n“name.” He was “jumped in” to Varrio Frontero Loco, through a process he described as\n“[j]ust imagine three guys beating on one person, kicking him, beating him, just\nthumping on him” for 13 seconds. He had also helped jump people into the gang.\nSanchez showed the jury a number of tattoos that signified his membership in Varrio\nFrontero Loco. Gang tattoos were important so people “won’t mess with us.”\n       A Sureño who wanted to prove himself would “[j]ust go to the streets. Beat up\nany Norteño you can think of to start with. . . . [¶] Just you earn respect and your stripes.\nStart shooting or just doing whatever you want.” You would do this with other people\n“[t]o make sure you do it. Just to make sure you ain’t lying about what you did.” When\n\n       10\n         Of the witnesses who provided significant testimony regarding the workings of\nthe Varrio Frontero Loco and Elizalde and Mota’s positions and participation in the gang,\nSanchez was the only one the court concluded was an accomplice as a matter of law.\nAccordingly, the jury was instructed to view his testimony with caution.\n\n\n                                              11\n\fSanchez went out to attack Norteños, he would take fellow Varrio Frontero Loco with\nhim. He would do that for “backup.” He would also do it to “make sure they do it, too.\nMake sure they look at you.”\n       Sanchez understood that at the time of trial, Mota and Elizalde had “green lighted”\nhim; that is, they had ordered him killed for talking to the police. Green lighting did not\noccur until the actual text of a statement made to the police was distributed “to the\nstreets,” generally through a defendant who received the statement from his lawyer.\n       Sureños were enemies with Norteños because they were “mixed people”: “part\nMexican . . . they mix with Mexican black, Mexican white.” You could tell who they\nwere by “[t]he hair, the clothes, the grill that is like the gold teeth they wear. [¶] And if\nthey got tattoos you look at tattoos, belts.” In particular, Norteños had long hair, “all of\nthe new clothes the black people be coming out with,” and wore the color red, including\nred belts. Sureños identified themselves with blue bandanas and blue belts.\n       Sanchez was familiar with a number of Norteño sub-gangs including West Side\nBerkeley, Montalvin, Varrio San Pablo. Each of them claimed a particular area. Varrio\nSan Pablo claimed the area near Broadway and the Hilltop Mall.\n       As a Sureño, when he saw a Norteño he was supposed to “[t]ake off, just don’t\neven think about it, just hit them up. . . . Just whoop his ass.”\n       Varrio Frontero Loco used violence to scare “[j]ust the people, Norteños\nwhoever—everybody, the blacks, the whites, the Asians.” They did so “[j]ust so they\nwon’t mess with us. . . . [P]eople be picking on people. Sometimes people just look for a\nway out. And just make sure they scared of you instead of you being scared of them.”\n       Fame mattered because it was a way of “representing my hood,” “[j]ust to let\npeople know . . . where you are from.” You did that by “doing a lot of things, shooting,\nselling drugs, getting money, cars, just whoop—whooping people in front of other\npeople.” A Varrio Frontero Loco would “throw it up” by telling someone who they were,\njust make sure they know it. Being feared by rival gang members was a good thing—\n“[y]ou can be walking the streets with no one, no one is trying to hit you up or\nsomething.”\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       Gang members would get together and brag about what they had done in order to\nlet people know that “if they mess with you they will get the same . . . treatment.” He\nwould also get together with other Varrio Frontero Loco and plan future crimes “to get\nrespect or to make people afraid.”\n       With regard to non-gang members, it was important to “let them know that . . . we\ndon’t mess with you and you just don’t mess with us.”\n       Drug sales were a part of being a Varrio Frontero Loco. Sanchez “wasn’t into\nthat,” but he had seen fellow gang member Gamaliel Elizalde selling drugs out of his\nbackyard. He would sometimes give drugs to Mota to sell and Mota would brag about it.\nThe drug sales were run out of Elizalde’s house.\n       Varrio Frontero Loco held meetings to “check in with each other, to make sure\nwhat was going on with each other and just what kind of problems, like people got\nproblems with someone, different rivals or with a Norteño or something.” Sometimes the\nmembers would put money together for people in jail to use for “hygienes like toothpaste,\nsoap, shampoo . . . .” Elizalde was in charge of putting money “on the books” for the\nVarrio Frontero Loco members who were in jail. The meetings were not held often.\nSometimes the meetings would take place at Victor Valencia’s house and sometimes at\nElizalde’s house.\nOccasionally, he and other members would “check,” or beat up, a member who was not\n“putting in work or he ain’t kicking it with us a lot . . . .”\n       At the time Sanchez joined Varrio Frontero Loco in 2005 or 2006, it was led by a\nnumber of men, including Gamaliel Elizalde. Elizalde was an “OG”11 or leader, “the one\nyou look up to. . . . The one[] that you go ask for advice.” One of the benefits of being a\nleader was that he “get to kickback or just don’t do a lot of things no more.” A leader\n\n\n       11\n          Sanchez explained that “OG” meant “[j]ust like an old Cadillac, like an older\nguy, just the one who is like forties, thirties, forties.” You get to be an “OG” by going\n“through a lot . . . . They went through their stages, just like we went through our stages,\nwe going through our stages. . . . [¶] . . . [T]hey know more stuff than we do. They got\nmore opportunities in their brain.”\n\n\n                                               13\n\fwould not “fight somebody or put a lot of work in the streets, shooting, whatever, just get\nto just relax and let the other generation do their work.”\n        A leader would have money from “things going on on the side . . . . [¶] . . . like\nthey were selling drugs . . . .” The leaders would use the “pee wees” or younger members\n“to distribute it. . . .”\n        In 2007, there were several subsets of Sureños with whom Sanchez was familiar:\nhis own gang, Varrio Frontero Loco, another gang called Mexican Loco and a third called\nRichmond Sur Trece. Although they were all Sureños, they did not always get along. In\n2007, a Varrio Frontero Loco leader called “Toby” shot a member of a Richmond Sur\nTrece and fled, along with his brothers, to avoid being killed in retaliation for murdering\na fellow Sureño. This left a void in the leadership of Varrio Frontero Loco, which was\nfilled by Elizalde. As Sanchez put it, after Toby fled, “everybody was just going to\nGama, so that's the only one who we look up to and who was there with us.”\nNevertheless, after Elizalde took over, Varrio Frontero Loco began to dissolve.\n“[E]verybody just try to take it their own way. It was—just disappeared. Some of them\nwent to some other towns. People got scared because they got shot at, who was getting\nstomped on.” At this point, Varrio Frontero Loco were “getting hurt” and “things were\nbad.”\n        Sanchez testified that “we just had to get it back together.” He and others referred\nto this as “bring[ing] the hood back.” To do this, it was necessary to “recruit[] new\npeople and try to do more damage to the Norteños, to the streets.” All of the Varrio\nFrontero Loco wanted to bring the hood back, including Elizalde. In terms of the\nhierarchy of Varrio Frontero Loco, Elizalde was the leader, and Sanchez was directly\nunder him along with Mota, Ruelas, and several others.\n        Elizalde told the Varrio Frontero Loco that they had to “put in more work,” “go to\nthe streets, ride around the streets,” “[m]ake sure they [the Norteños and everybody]\nknow we around, we ain’t gone.” They would do this by “hit[ting] the streets, ride\naround, especially in Norteño territory.” Sanchez explained that this was effective\nbecause the Norteños “don’t expect us to go. They think we going to be scared. They\n\n\n                                              14\n\fthink we going to just lay back. And we go there and they go, oh, man, they coming back\nand they coming back hard.” In Norteño territory, [i]f you see them just shoot them or\nwhoop them, whatever you got. If you don’t got no gun you just get out and do what you\ngot.”\n        Sanchez discussed this plan with all the Varrio Frontero Loco, including Mota.\nHe didn’t talk to Elizalde about why he wanted to bring the hood back; he only knew that\nElizalde “wanted it done.”\n        According to Sanchez, he and Mota, along with Luis Ruelas, Luii Hernandez, and\nCole Azamar were “the ones who was going to bring them back . . . just the ones who got\nto take care of everything.” They covered different parts of Richmond. In addition to\nattacking Norteños, they also recruited and “guided” “pee wees.” Elizalde wanted them\nto “get into the high schools and expand the Sureños and hurt the Norteños.”\n        Shortly before Sanchez was arrested, Mota came to his house. He was nervous\nbecause the police had been to his house. Mota told him that he [Mota] “went in the\nshootout.” He also spoke to Jorge Camacho who told him that he “shot a lady.”\n        2.    Oscar Menendez\n        Oscar Menendez testified that at the time of the Rico McIntosh murder, he “was\nundecided” about being a Varrio Frontero Loco. He “didn’t want it for my future . . . it\nwas just fine being with them, you know, being with girls and having parties, but I didn’t\nlike the rest that they used to do.” He had a lot of Sureño mentions on his MySpace page,\nand he liked being around the gang because it “was fun because they always used to hang\naround with a lot of girls and they always used to have parties every weekend and, you\nknow, beers and music.”\n        He was aware that gang members “hunted and attacked Norteños.” However, no\none ever “told me to do it.” He was never “jumped in.” He associated with the Varrio\nFrontero Loco for six or seven months beginning in November 2007 until his arrest about\na week after the McIntosh murder.\n        It was typical for gang members to brag about their crimes. He explained, “they\nsay that’s what they get respect because when they—when the rest of the guys knew what\n\n\n                                            15\n\fyou were doing they will respect you more than what they do.” This was a “big deal” to\nthe Varrio Frontero Loco.\n       The Norteños were the Varrio Frontero Loco’s rivals. Menendez knew what areas\nwere Norteño territory. He also knew that if a Varrio Frontero Loco found a Norteño or\nsaw one he was to “beat him up and if you have a gun you have to use it.” That is\nbecause the Varrio Frontero Loco “wanted to get rid of Norteños.”\n       He knew both Javier Gomez and Victor Cervantes, both of whom were members\nof the Sureño gang, Mexican Loco. When he associated with these gangs he knew they\ngot along “but not that much” at first.\n       According to Menendez, Varrio Frontero Loco “wasn’t that much organized.” He\n“never knew who was the shot-caller . . . .” He was aware that the members “used to\nreceive orders from some older guys . . . .” When he asked what they were doing, the\nmembers would say “don’t trip . . . that’s something that I got to do and that’s it.” In his\nown mind, he thought that Elizalde was the shot-caller because he once heard him giving\norders to someone. At one point, Elizalde told Menendez that “in order to be a Sureño\nyou have to get down, you now, don’t have to be a fear of anybody, if you see a Norteño\non the street you have to put him on check, beat him up or anything that is in your hands\nto get him away from Richmond, and to don’t let them come to Richmond, let them stay\nin San Pablo.” Specifically Elizalde told him that if he saw a Norteño he was to beat him\nup and if he had a gun to use it. Elizalde once told him that in order to be a Sureño he\nhad to “stick with them all the time and commit sort of a crime that he used to commit—I\nhad to do the crime that they used to do in the week and stick around with them and, you\nknow, do whatever they—they were doing during the week.” This would include\n“[s]tealing cars and robbing people, shooting Norteños, beat them up.” Mota told him the\nsame thing. He also told him that he had to “earn” a Varrio Frontero Loco tattoo by\ndoing something “big” like kill a Norteño.\n       On three occasions, he heard Elizalde instruct someone to beat up a Norteño or to\nlook for him. He also heard Elizalde say that Richmond was Sureño territory.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Menendez named a number of Varrio Frontero Loco as those with the most\nrespect in the gang. They were Molina, Azamar, Camacho, Ruelas and Sanchez. He also\nknew Larry Valencia, who he didn’t think was a gang member.\n       He felt that he had to do what Elizalde told him to do. He did not, however, think\nthat he had to hunt Norteños in San Pablo. When he went with Mota and Javier Gomez\non April 13, 2008, which was the day he shot himself by accident, he did not know that\nthey were looking for Norteños to kill. Nor did he think that was the case on April 26,\n2008. He did not realize that they were looking for Norteños to kill until the car did not\nturn toward the McDonald’s on Broadway as he had expected.\n       In jail, Menendez received a message on the module where he was housed from\nthe Sureño shot caller. The message laid out in detail how he was to behave while\nincarcerated. Among other things, he was to contribute money to buy food and supplies\nfor other Sureños, he was not to speak to the police, he was to follow orders from the shot\ncaller and if he was asked, he was to beat people up the shot caller told him to attack. He\nwas also required to give the shot caller a copy of the police report on his arrest as well as\nany other legal materials in order to permit the shot caller to determine whether he was a\nsnitch. Menendez refused to give these materials to the shot caller and, several days later,\nhe was beat up by several Sureños. He entered protective custody afterwards.\n       3.     Luis Ruelas\n       Luis Ruelas testified that he was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco for six years\nuntil 2008. He was 14 or 15 when he was jumped into the gang. Jose Valencia brought\nhim into the gang.\n       Ruelas’s testimony before the grand jury was admitted into evidence. In that\ntestimony, Ruelas told the grand jury that he had “earned” a tattoo that said “Chap Killa”\non his arm. He worked his way up from the bottom of the gang by earning “respect”\nthrough shooting and beating up Norteños. Norteños were identified by the color red,\nwhile Sureños wore the color blue. Ruelas became close to one of the top people in\nVarrio Frontero Loco at the time, Victor Valencia. Valencia had secured their territory\nby running out another gang that had previously been there.\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       Ruelas was deported to Mexico and Victor Valencia fled the country. When\nRuelas returned, Elizalde “was the main—was the kingpin at that time, but everything\nelse was a mess on the streets.” Elizalde was “moving all the drugs.” With Victor\nValencia gone, “[h]e took over all our stuff.” Ruelas did not like Elizalde. Elizalde gave\norders to kill people, including one occasion when Elizalde told Ruelas to “kill somebody\nbecause they popped his tires.” He didn’t do it because at the time he was working as an\ninformant with the San Pablo police. As part of his deal with the police, he promised not\nto participate in the commission of any crimes. Elizalde also would send Ruelas out to\ncollect debts using violence.\n       On one occasion, before he returned to Richmond, Ruelas spoke to Hector Molina,\nwho told him “We miss you . . . . We bringing the hood back.” According to Ruelas,\n“the whole part of being a Sureño” was to “assault or kill Norteños.”\n       Ruelas’s testimony at an earlier gang prosecution was also admitted into evidence.\nAt that time, Ruelas testified that violence was an important part of bringing the hood\nback “[b]ecause if . . . you don’t have people be scared of you, they ain’t going to respect\nyou. They going to be like, you know, whatever. As long as you show them you really\nabout it, they will think about it twice before they come at you.” Violence also helped\nrecruit new members who “seen what we were doing and they knew we had money. We\nhad girls, we had everything. And they wanted it, too, so they started joining in.”\n       At trial, Ruelas was reluctant to testify because of threats to his family. In general,\nhe either outright denied or claimed to forget testimony he had earlier given about Varrio\nFrontero Loco. At trial, he testified that Varrio Frontero Loco did not have a structure in\nwhich there was a shot caller. Instead, there were people he looked up to, including\nVictor Valencia. Ruelas also had respect for Elizalde because he was his elder.\n       Ruelas showed the jury tattoos on his forearms that said “Chap Killa.” A Chap, he\nexplained, is a Norteño gang member. He had done a lot of crimes to earn the tattoo.\n       One of the rules of being a Sureño “is just you got to represent yourself the right\nway.” To do that, you had to have respect, which you earned through loyalty. If a Varrio\nFrontero Loco saw a Norteño he was expected to get into a fight with the Norteño. He\n\n\n                                             18\n\fwould sometimes go out and look for Norteños to find. The Broadway area in San Pablo\nwas one place the Norteños hung out.\n       He knew Elizalde because they “used to kick it outside his house.” Elizalde was a\nVarrio Frontero Loco. He was older and “some guys came up to him for advice.”\nAlthough he had earlier told the police that Elizalde was “running the streets,” he had\ndone so because “I was just trying to save my life from being prosecuted, but it was—\nwhat I said was wrong . . . .” In general, he retracted a number of statements he made\nearlier in which he had identified Elizalde as the person who had taken over drug sales,\nthe person to whom he would go if he needed a gun quickly, and as having a list of\npeople that needed to be hit. He also did not remember telling the police that Mota\nbrought a pound of methamphetamine to his house along with a gun and said he was\ngoing on a drug deal.\nD.     The Verdicts\n       The Gomez jury deliberated for three days and came back with a second degree\nmurder verdict with regard to Rico McIntosh. It found the firearm and gang\nenhancements true. The trial court sentenced Gomez to an aggregate term of 40 years to\nlife in prison.\n       After four days of deliberation, the Mota/Elizalde jury brought back guilty verdicts\non three murder counts and an acquittal with regard to the death of Lisa Thayer. It also\nfound Mota and Elizalde guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, participating in a\ncriminal street gang and found true enhancements for participating in a criminal street\ngang. As to Mota, the jury found true an enhancement for intentionally discharging a\nfirearm causing great bodily injury or death. Elizalde was also found guilty of dissuading\na witness by force or threat of force. The court sentenced Mota to an aggregate term of\n100 years to life. It sentenced Elizalde to an aggregate term of 103 years to life.\n       This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f                                    III. DISCUSSION\nA.     Unforeseeable Supervening Cause Instruction\n       Rico McIntosh’s death was caused by a pulmonary embolism 72 hours after he\nwas shot and a day after he was released from the hospital. Gomez argues that the trial\ncourt erred because it failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, that they were required to\ndetermine whether actions other than Gomez's—in particular, the decision of his doctors\nto release him from the hospital—constituted an unforeseeable supervening case. He also\ncontends that the instructions the court gave were inadequate. We disagree.\n       a.     Factual Background\n       McIntosh died at around noon on April 29, 2008, after having been released from\nJohn Muir Hospital the morning before. Dr. Ikechi Ogan performed McIntosh’s autopsy.\nOgan examined two bullet wounds; one was located on McIntosh’s right thigh and the\nother on his left hip. Neither was fired from close range. McIntosh had large hematomas\non his thigh and hip where he had been shot. A large blood clot was blocking both of\nMcIntosh’s lungs. Ogan determined that this blood clot, which totally blocked the flow\nof blood, made it impossible for McIntosh to breathe and was the cause of his death. The\nclot was caused by “complications of the gunshot wound to [McIntosh’s] pelvic region”\nand was the cause of his death.\n       Ogan testified that in general a doctor would know that blood clots are “very likely\nwhen you have injury to the lower body and pelvis.” The trial court sustained an\nobjection to defendant’s question about whether the doctors at John Muir should have\n“kept an eye on” McIntosh. Ogan testified that McIntosh’s follow-up care at John Muir\nwas not relevant to his determination of the cause of death: “I have no desire to comment\non . . . why he was released. [¶] My job was to figure out a cause of death of this\ngentleman. And I did that with the information I had. [¶] I had enough information from\nthe investigating officers and the sheriff’s department to do what I had to do and I did\nthat. [¶] That he was released was not . . . in my control. I had a dead body in front of\nme. I had to decide what killed this dead body and I did that.”\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       When asked if the gunshot wounds would have been fatal “but for” the clotting,\nOgan replied as follows: “[T]he best thing that I can say is that I have seen people who\nhave gunshot wounds to an extremity, say a thigh or leg, who died. I have seen people\nwho had a gunshot[] wound to the thigh or leg who didn’t die. Same with the pelvis, it\nall depends on the individual.”\n       b.     Discussion\n       Gomez does not appear to challenge the instructions the court gave the jury on\ncausation. Rather, he argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury sua sponte\nthat if it found that the decision to release McIntosh was the sole cause of his death\n(apparently if it was grossly negligent), then it could not find that Gomez was the cause\nof McIntosh’s death.\n       He is incorrect. The trial court’s duty to instruct the jury sua sponte extends only\nto the general principles of law that are necessary for the jury’s understanding of the case.\n(People v. Mayfield (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1191713\"><a href=\"/opinion/1191713/people-v-mayfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773.) The court did so by giving the jury the\nfull panoply of instructions on causation.12 Having adequately instructed the jury, the\n\n\n       12\n          The trial court gave the jury several instructions on proximate cause. It\ninstructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.41 as follows: “There may be more than\none cause of death of Rico McIntosh. When the conduct of two or more persons\ncontributes concurrently as a cause of the death, the conduct of each is a cause of the\ndeath if that conduct was also a substantial factor contributing to the result. A cause is\nconcurrent if it was operative at the moment of the death and acted with another cause to\nproduce the death. If you find that a defendant’s conduct was a cause of death to another\nperson, then it is no defense that the conduct of some other person, even the deceased\nperson, contributed to the death. It is not a defense to a criminal charge that the deceased\nor some other person was guilty of negligence, which was a contributory cause of the\ndeath involved in the case. Where the original injury is a cause of the death, the fact that\nthe immediate cause of death was the medical or surgical treatment administered or that\nthe treatment was a factor contributing to the cause of death will not relieve the person\nwho inflicted the original injury from responsibility. Where, however, the original injury\nis not a cause of the death and the death was caused by medical or surgical treatment or\nsome other cause, then the defendant is not guilty of the unlawful homicide [¶] If a\nperson unlawfully inflicts a physical injury upon another person and that injury is a cause\nof the latter’s death, that conduct constitutes an unlawful homicide even though the injury\ninflicted was not the only cause of death. Or, moreover, that conduct constitutes\n\n                                             21\n\ftrial court did not have a duty give clarifying or amplifying instructions unless counsel\nrequested them. (Id. at p. 778.) Nor does defendant argue that the instructions the trial\ncourt gave were either incorrect or misleading.\n         Gomez instead argues that the court should have instructed the jury on the\napplication of these principles of causation to the decision by the hospital to release\nMcIntosh and instructed the jury that if it found that the decision to release McIntosh was\ngrossly improper, they could conclude that this maltreatment was the sole source of\ndeath.\n         We disagree. The court’s sua sponte duty to instruct on general principles of law\ndoes not extend to “pinpoint” instructions. (People v. Saille (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386085\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386085/people-v-saille/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1119.) Pinpoint instructions “relate particular facts to a legal issue in the case or\n‘pinpoint’ the crux of a defendant’s case, such as mistaken identification or alibi.\n[Citation.] They are required to be given upon request when there is evidence supportive\nof the theory, but they are not required to be given sua sponte.” (Ibid.) Gomez did not\nrequest such an instruction and the court had no sua sponte duty to give one.\n         Therefore, we conclude that the jury was properly and adequately instructed on the\nprinciples of causation. Nor does defense counsel’s decision not to request such an\ninstruction amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the lack of evidence to\nsupport the defense theory that inadequate medical care was the sole cause of McIntosh's\ndeath, any request for a pinpoint instruction on this issue would have been unavailing.\nMoreover, even if the court had given this pinpoint instruction, the result would not have\nbeen more favorable to Gomez. Ogan determined that the cause of McIntosh's death was\na blood clot that blocked the flow of blood and made it impossible for McIntosh to\nbreathe. The doctor’s testimony that the blood clot was caused by “complications of the\n\nunlawful homicide, even if; [¶] One the person injured had been already weakened by\ndisease, injury, physical condition or other cause; [¶] Or, two, it is probable that a person\nin sound physical condition injured in the same way would not have died from the injury;\n[¶] Or, three, it is probable that the injury only hastened the death of the injured person;\n[¶] Or, four, the injured person would have died soon thereafter from another cause or\nother causes.”\n\n\n                                              22\n\fgunshot wound to [McIntosh’s] pelvic region” established that Gomez’s conduct was a\nsubstantial factor in causing McIntosh’s death. In contrast, there was no evidence to\nsupport the defense theory that the decision to release McIntosh was so grossly negligent\nas to be the sole cause of his death.13\nB.     Jury Question Regarding Second Degree Murder\n       Gomez argues that the trial court erred in its response to a question posed by the\njury during its deliberations. We disagree.\n       During its deliberations, the jury sent out the following note seeking clarification:\n“[R]egarding CALJIC 8.20 [first degree murder] . . . if the act of shooting resulted in a\nmurder and the premeditation was the act of shooting, does this imply a premeditation of\nmurder when murder was the result not the intent?”\n       The court provided the jury with a typewritten response that first addressed the\npremeditation or “intent to kill” element of first degree murder: “Under the\npremeditation and deliberation theory of first degree murder described in CALJIC 8.20\nthe defendant must have express malice that is, a manifest intent to kill, as well as\npremeditation and deliberation before acting.”\n       The court then went on to describe the interplay between the lack of intent to kill\nand second degree murder: “If you find that the defendant intended to shoot, but did not\nhave the intent to kill, then the resulting death would be a second degree murder on this\ntheory if you find that the death was a natural and probable consequence of the shooting.\nPlease consider this response only in connection with all of the jury instructions as a\nwhole.”\n\n\n       13\n          Although Gomez cites People v. Roberts (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249738/people-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> in support of his\nargument, this case actually undermines his point. In Roberts, defense counsel requested\na pinpoint instruction to the effect that “if the medical care [the victim] received after the\nassault was so inadequate that it amounted to the sole cause of his death, then he was not\nthe proximate cause of Gardner’s killing and was not liable for it.” (Id. at p. 311.) The\ncourt’s refusal to give this instruction was upheld because, as here, “the record is devoid\nof any evidence of grossly improper treatment. . . . The jury need not be instructed on a\ntheory for which no evidence has been presented. [Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 312 -313.)\n\n\n                                              23\n\f       Gomez contends that the trial court’s statement regarding second degree murder\nwas erroneous because the court did not include the entire definition of second degree\nmurder in its response to the jury. Specifically, he argues that, because the court’s\nresponse to the jury’s question did not mention the third element of implied malice\nmurder, namely that “the act was deliberately performed with knowledge of the danger\nto, and with conscious disregard for, human life” (CALJIC No. 8.31), the response\n“invited the jury to avoid the question of conscious disregard altogether and find\nappellant guilty of second degree murder regardless of whether or not he appreciated and\ndisregarded the risk to human life inherent in his actions.”\n       He is incorrect. Penal Code section 113814 imposes on the trial court a mandatory\n“duty to clear up any instructional confusion expressed by the jury. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Gonzalez (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612406\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612406/people-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1212, superseded by statute on other grounds.) “This\ndoes not mean the court must always elaborate on the standard instructions. Where the\noriginal instructions are themselves full and complete, the court has discretion under\nsection 1138 to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury’s\nrequest for information. [Citation.]” (People v. Beardslee (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379313\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379313/people-v-beardslee/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97.)\n       The trial court responded to a question about only one of the elements of first\ndegree murder—namely, premeditation. This response was appropriately tailored to the\njury’s question. Moreover, the court explicitly stated that its response was not intended\nto encompass all issues related to the crimes of first and second degree murder when it\ninstructed the jury to “consider this response only in connection with all of the jury\ninstructions as a whole.”\n       Gomez does not—indeed, cannot—argue that the court’s instructions with regard\nto first and second degree murder, either initially or after the jury’s inquiry, were\nincorrect. His argument instead is that the court was required to reinstruct the jury on the\nelements of second degree murder. In other words, defendant’s argument is that the court\n\n\n\n       14\n            All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n                                               24\n\fwas precluded from answering the jury’s question about an element of these crimes\nwithout also reinstructing the jury as to all of the elements of these crimes.\n       In fact, the court did make clear to the jury that its response was intended to\nsupplement rather than supplant its earlier instructions. By charging the jury with the\nresponsibility of considering the instruction as a whole, the court ensured that the jury\nwould not misconstrue its response as revising rather than clarifying the earlier\ninstructions. The jury sought an answer to a limited question. It was given one.\nTherefore, it is unlikely it would have considered the court's response as redefining the\nelements of second degree murder.\n       We reject defendant’s argument.\nC.     Threats to Witnesses\n       Gomez next argues that the trial court erred in permitting Oscar Menendez, Jorge\nSanchez, and Luis Ruelas to testify about threats they received before they testified.\nHowever, Gomez also concedes that, under Evidence Code section 780 and People v.\nMendoza (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084-1086, such evidence is admissible to assist in the\nassessment of a witness's credibility and instead argues that, under federal law, the\nevidence was inadmissible. (Dudley v. Duckworth (7th Cir. 1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510273\"><a href=\"/opinion/510273/mckinley-dudley-v-jack-duckworth-warden-and-indiana-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971-\n972.) As defendant acknowledges, we are bound to follow our Supreme Court’s ruling\non this issue and, therefore, reject this argument. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (1962) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455.)\nD.     Instructions Regarding Testimony of Menendez, Cervantes, Valencia and\n       Ruelas\n       1. Menendez\n       Defendants argue that the trial court erred when it rejected defendant Gomez’s\nrequest that the court instruct the jury that Menendez was an accomplice as a matter of\nlaw and, instead, allowed the jury to determine whether certain witnesses were\naccomplices.15 Accordingly, defendants take issue with a number of instructions given\n\n       15\n          The People correctly point out that Elizalde has waived any objection to the trial\ncourt’s ruling that Menendez, Ruelas, Sanchez, and Valencia were not accomplices as a\n\n                                             25\n\fby the trial court regarding the jury’s consideration of whether certain witnesses were\naccomplices. These instructions include the direction that “[t]he defendant has the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that each of the following\nwitnesses was an accomplice in the crimes charged against the defendants: [¶] Victor\nCervantes [¶] Oscar Menendez [¶] Luis Ruelas [¶] Larry Valencia.” The court also\ninstructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.14 that “[m]erely assenting to or aiding or\nassisting in the commission of a crime without knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the\nperpetrator and without the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging or facilitating\nthe commission of the crime is not criminal. Thus a person who assents to, or aids, or\nassists in, the commission of a crime without that knowledge and without that intent or\npurpose is not an accomplice in the commission of the crime.”\n       Generally, the issue of whether a witness is an accomplice is a factual question.\nOnly when there is no dispute as to either the facts or the inferences reasonably to be\ndrawn from the facts would the court find a witness an accomplice as a matter of law.\n(People v. Fauber (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834; People v. Rodriguez (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1374541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1374541/people-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n759 (Rodriguez.)\n       Section 1111 defines an accomplice as a person who is liable to prosecution for\nthe identical offense for which the defendant is being tried. In Menendez’s case, his\nresponsibility for McIntosh’s death would have been as an aider and abettor since Gomez\nrather than Menendez was the shooter. (People v. McLain (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1350499\"><a href=\"/opinion/1350499/people-v-mclain/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106\n[§ 1111 covers all principals to a crime, including aiders and abettors].) Menendez’s\npresence at the scene, his failure to prevent McIntosh’s murder and even his assistance to\nGomez and Mota with knowledge of their criminal purpose (of which there was no\nevidence) would not be enough to support a finding that Menendez was an accomplice as\na matter of law. (Rodriguez, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 760.) Menendez would only be an\n\n\n\nmatter of law. Elizalde told the court that he would “rather leave it [the determination of\nwhether these witnesses were accomplices] up to the jury . . . .” Nevertheless, we\nconsider this issue because it has also been raised by Mota.\n\n\n                                            26\n\faccomplice as a matter of law if the evidence was undisputed that Menendez shared\nGomez and Mota’s criminal purpose. (People v. Sully (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386747\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386747/people-v-sully/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1227.)\n       In fact, there was considerable evidence in the record that Menendez did not even\nrealize that Gomez and Mota intended to look for and kill Norteños, much less share their\ncriminal purpose.16 Menendez testified that at the time McIntosh was murdered he had\nnot committed to being a Varrio Frontero Loco, not wanting that “for my future.” He\nwanted only to be with girls and go to parties with the gang members, “but . . . didn’t like\nthe rest that they used to do.” Although he knew that gang members attacked Norteños,\nhe himself was never asked to join in. Menendez knew that the Norteños were the Varrio\nFrontero Loco’s rivals. Menendez knew what areas were Norteño territory. He also\nknew that if a Varrio Frontero Loco found a Norteño or saw one he was to “[b]eat him up\nand if you have a gun you have to use it.” He did not, however, think that he was\nexpected to hunt Norteños. When he went with Mota and Gomez on April 13, 2008,\nwhich was the day he shot himself by accident, he did not know that they were looking\nfor Norteños to kill. Nor did he think that was the case on April 26, 2008. He did not\nrealize that they were looking for Norteños to kill until the car did not turn toward the\nMcDonald’s on Broadway as he had expected.\n       Menendez’s testimony that he neither wished nor was expected to join in the\nviolence against Norteños, along with his testimony that he was unaware that Gomez and\nMota intended to shoot anyone the night McIntosh was murdered or on the earlier\noccasion when he (Menendez) was accidentally shot, created a factual dispute as to\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          The trial court specifically found that Menendez’s “version of events that when\nhe first shot himself that is because he was grabbing the gun out of the hands of whoever\nwas holding it to prevent him from shooting someone. On the second occasion he didn’t\nknow that anyone had the gun until Mr. Gomez pulled it out and started shooting. [¶] So\nmy view is if the jury accepts Mr. Menendez’s version of events, it is not as a matter of\nlaw that he is an accomplice. That is a factual dispute the jury must decide. [¶] And I am\nessentially finding the same thing as to all of the ones I listed in the instruction saying\nthat the defense has the burden of proving it by a preponderance.”\n\n\n                                             27\n\fwhether he was an accomplice. The court, therefore, properly put this matter before the\njury.\n        Gomez argues for the first time on appeal that the People were judicially estopped\nfrom opposing his argument that the court should instruct the jury that Menendez was an\naccomplice as a matter of law because they had earlier obtained an indictment that stated\nthat Menendez “went hunting for Norteños with [Gomez] and Mr. Mota and that Mr.\nMcIntosh was killed with Mr. Menendez’s gun . . . .”\n        The application of judicial estoppel is discretionary. (Levin v. Ligon (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2304607\"><a href=\"/opinion/2304607/levin-v-ligon/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1468). Because Gomez did not request at trial that the court exercise\nits discretion in this regard, he has forfeited this argument on appeal. (People v. Scott\n(1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353; People v. Williams (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257963\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257963/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 655.)\n        In any event, the trial court would surely not have granted such a request. The\ncourt has the discretion to impose this remedy “ ‘ “when a party’s inconsistent behavior\nwill otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice.” ’ ” (Levin v. Ligon, supra, 140\nCal.App.4th at p. 1468.) The People did not engage in inconsistent behavior. The\nindictment did not allege that Menendez was an accomplice as a matter of law. At best, it\ncontains language that could support such an argument. The record contained ample\nevidence to the contrary and the trial court properly made its decision based on this\nevidence.\n        2. Cervantes\n        There was little evidence that Cervantes conspired with Varrio Frontero Loco to\nkill Norteños or that he was otherwise involved in any of the crimes committed by\ndefendants. Cervantes testified that he gave Molina a ride home after he got out of jail\nand spoke to him about the killing of an unnamed Norteño. Although there was evidence\nthat Cervantes was a member of Mexican Locos, there was no evidence that he shared\nMota or Elizalde’s intention to kill Norteños in order to increase the stature of Varrio\nFrontero Loco in the community. Therefore, the trial court properly left to the jury the\nquestion of whether Cervantes was an accomplice.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       3.     Valencia\n       There was also a factual dispute about whether Valencia was an accomplice to the\nPerez murder. Menendez testified that he did not think Valencia was even a gang\nmember. Valencia testified that he was not a gang member and only went in the car with\nAzamar after they encouraged him to do so. Valencia was aware that they had driven\ninto Norteño territory, but he had never seen anyone killed before. In fact, he asked to be\ndriven home after the murder rather than join in the bragging and celebration that\nfollowed.\n       The fact that Valencia was present at the scene and did not prevent the Perez\nmurder is insufficient to make him an accomplice. Moreover, even if there was evidence\n(and there was not) that he assisted Mota and Molina in the murder, this would not be\nsufficient for a finding that he was an accomplice. (Rodriguez, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p.\n760.) Our review of the record reveals that the trial court did not have before it\nundisputed evidence that Valencia shared Gomez and Mota’s criminal purpose. (People\nv. Sully, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 1227.) Therefore, it was not required to instruct the jury\nthat Valencia was an accomplice as a matter of law.\n       4.     Ruelas\n       Ruelas, like Elizalde, was not present at any of the murders. In addition, there is\nno evidence in the record directly linking him to any of the crimes committed by\ndefendants. His complicity in these crimes would, therefore, be as a co-conspirator.\n       There was conflicting evidence about whether Ruelas had assumed a co-\nconspirator role in “bringing the hood back.” Ruelas appeared to be an important\nmember of Varrio Frontero Loco. Sanchez testified that, in terms of the hierarchy of\nVarrio Frontero Loco, Elizalde was the leader, and Sanchez was directly under him along\nwith Mota, Ruelas, and several others. According to Sanchez, Ruelas was one of the\nVarrio Frontero Loco who were “going to bring them back . . . just the ones who got to\ntake care of everything.” Menendez also named a number of Varrio Frontero Loco as\nthose with the most respect in the gang. Ruelas was among them. Elizalde also would\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fsend Ruelas out to collect debts using violence. Ruelas testified that violence was “an\nimportant part of bringing the hood back.”\n       Ruelas himself testified that he was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco for six\nyears until 2008. There was evidence, however, that Ruelas’s involvement in Varrio\nFrontero Loco was most significant and committed before Elizalde assumed control.\nRuelas did not like Elizalde. Although Elizalde had given him an order to kill someone,\nRuelas did not do so because he was working as an informant and had agreed not to\nparticipate in the commission of any crimes.\n       Given the factual dispute about Ruelas’s accomplice status, the trial court did not\nerr in putting the question to the jury.\n       5.     Prejudice\n       Even if the trial court did err in putting the accomplice question to the jury, “[a]\ntrial court’s failure to instruct on accomplice liability under section 1111 is harmless if\nthere is sufficient corroborating evidence in the record. [Citation.] ‘Corroborating\nevidence may be slight, may be entirely circumstantial, and need not be sufficient to\nestablish every element of the charged offense. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] The evidence is\nsufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the crime in such a way as to satisfy\nthe jury that the accomplice is telling the truth. [Citation.]” (People v. Lewis (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370.)\n       We reject defendants’ argument that the witnesses’ testimony was insufficiently\ncorroborated. First, with regard to Oscar Menendez, Menendez testified that after he\nwitnessed the McIntosh shooting, he did not want to join in Mota and Gomez’s\ncelebration of the murder and asked them to take him home. He testified that when they\narrived at his house, Mota told Menendez that he was on parole and couldn’t have the\ngun. Mota told Menendez to take the gun. This testimony was corroborated by San\nPablo Police Detective David Hoff, who testified that he did in fact find the gun used in\nthe McIntosh shooting in Menendez’s bedroom. Menendez’s description of the way in\nwhich McIntosh was approached was also corroborated. Menendez testified that when\nMota spotted Rico McIntosh, Gomez asked him “if he is a buster.” McIntosh’s friend\n\n\n                                             30\n\fLorry Scherrer testified that McIntosh told her after the shooting that he had been\napproached by three people who asked him if he was a “buster” before they shot him.\nSan Pablo Police Officer Matthew Spanner also testified that McIntosh told him that he\nwas asked if he was a “buster” before he was shot. The testimony of Hoff, Scherrer and\nSpanner provide sufficient corroboration of Menendez’s testimony.\n       Second, Victor Cervantes testified that when he picked Molina up from jail,\nMolina told him that he had been released because he had been caught with a gun that\nwas not the murder weapon. Molina also told him, in effect, that he and Romero had\nmurdered Centron. Molina’s telephone calls to his mother in which he made the same\nadmission adequately corroborate Cervantes’s testimony.\n       Third, Luis Ruelas’s testimony that Molina told him that he had killed Centron\nwas corroborated by the same telephone calls to his mother that corroborated Cervantes’s\ntestimony.\n       Finally, Valencia testified that when Camacho got out of the car he said to Luis\nPerez “Show me your hands, show me your hands.” When Perez yelled “[w]hat the fuck\nis going on?” Camacho immediately shot him. This was corroborated by a neighbor who\nheard the confrontation, Ganehin Saele. Saele testified that she heard someone say “what\nthe fuck?” and then heard gunshots.\nE.     Batson-Wheeler\n       Mota contends that, in exercising a peremptory challenge against Juror Number 5,\nthe only African-American juror on the panel, the prosecutor violated his right to a trial\nby a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community, a right guaranteed\nunder both the California Constitution (article I, section 16) and the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. He is incorrect.\n       1.     Factual Background\n       After the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to Juror No. 5, defense\ncounsel moved for a mistrial under Batson v.

According to counsel, this juror had “27 years of military\nexperience. He did not indicate any biases, and I believe that he is being relieved because\nof his race.” The court asked the prosecutor to respond “to the issue of a prima facie\nshowing.”\n       The prosecutor offered the following response: “I do not believe there is any\nprima facie showing, and this is why: I worked extremely hard to rehabilitate a juror\nnamed [Mr. P.]. [¶] Mr. [P.] was actually seated next to [Juror No. 5] last week when he\ncame into the box immediately in front of [Juror No. 5]. [¶] Mr. [P.] was an African-\nAmerican male about the same age as [Juror No. 5], and I liked a lot of things about Mr.\n[P.], including his job along with his wife’s experience as an emergency room nurse.\n[¶] Unfortunately, as you may recall, I worked hard to rehabilitate him, and he said that I\nhad gotten him from the defense starting on the 30 yard line up to the 45. [¶] He was\nclose to not being for cause, but I didn’t do my job well enough, I suppose, and he ended\nup being a for cause challenge made by Mr. Morton and Ms. Bethards. [¶] That was an\nAfrican-American juror that we lost, who[m] I was perfectly satisfied with. [¶] On the\nother hand, I don’t believe I need to give my reasons at this point, because you haven’t\nmade a prima facie case, but I do think the fact that I worked hard to rehabilitate one\nAfrican-American juror, was not able to do so, cuts directly against any argument that\nthere is a prima facie case of discrimination based on race in the People’s peremptory\nchallenge, or voir dire strategy.”\n       Defendants argued that the People’s effort to rehabilitate an African-American\njuror was insignificant in light of the fact that Juror No. 5 was a candidate who was\n“completely neutral.”\n       The court ruled that defendants had failed to make a prima facie case. The court\nexplained that, under the standard articulated in Johnson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799972\"><a href=\"/opinion/799972/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,17 “I do\n\n\n       17\n        The court correctly summarized that standard as requiring an inquiry into\n“whether the defendant has shown based on the totality of the relevant facts that those\n\n                                             32\n\fnot believe the facts as [a] totality before me would suggest that inference is appropriate.\n[¶] I do understand . . . that a person of the African-American race is within a cognizable\ngroup, and I do know that the law . . . permits a finding of . . . a prima facie case on the\nbasis of a single strike of that group. So it’s not a numerical issue, it’s the conduct of the\nvoir dire as a whole.” The court also noted that “I do think that [Juror No. 5] is the first\nAfrican-American who has been in the box for purposes of peremptories. [¶] We have\nhad other African-American potential jurors, but they have been excused for cause or\nhardships. [¶] The record would reflect that so far [Juror No. 5] is the only African-\nAmerican in the box as I have indicated; that the defendants are of Hispanic descent, to\nthe extent that may or may not be relevant, but, in any event, I don’t find a prima facie\ncase, but you may state your reasons for the record.”18\n       The prosecutor stated “for the record” that “there are a lot of good things about\n[Juror No. 5], including his military service. Unfortunately, the main part of his military\nservice was serving as a substance abuse counselor. . . . [A]lmost as a general rule, I am\nnot going to leave counselors or psychiatrists on a criminal jury. [¶] On top of that, I\nspecifically questioned [Juror No. 5] about this, a substance abuse counselor in his\nposition worked with almost, I think he said, almost 90 percent of his work had been\ninvolved in criminal activity and had been accused or convicted for drug activity.\nSomebody that works with felons or convicted misdemeanants or convicted felons on a\ndaily basis is not someone I want on a criminal jury of any sort, no matter what color,\nwhat creed, what race they are.”\n       The court then excused Juror No. 5. Defendants now argue that it erred in so\ndoing. We disagree.\n\n\n\nfacts give rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose or whether the evidence is\nsufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.”\n       18\n         Although we conclude that, because the trial court correctly found that no prima\nfacie case had been shown, the prosecutor’s explanation of his rationale for excluding\nJuror No. 5 is not relevant to the question of whether there a prima facie case has been\nmade, we nevertheless include this information in order to discuss that issue.\n\n\n                                              33\n\f          2.     Discussion\n          We apply certain well-established principles in deciding this issue. “[T]he use of\nperemptory challenges by a prosecutor to strike prospective jurors on the basis of group\nmembership violates the right of a criminal defendant to trial by a jury drawn from a\nrepresentative cross-section of the community under article 1, section 16 of the California\nConstitution.” (People v. Alvarez (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160457\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160457/people-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192; see also Wheeler, supra,\n22 Cal.3d at p. 272.) This discriminatory use of peremptory challenges similarly violates\nthe defendant's federal constitutional right to equal protection. (Batson, supra, 476 U.S.\nat pp. 84-89.) [¶] We presume the People use their preemptory challenges in a\nconstitutional manner. (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 278; People v. Alvarez, supra, 14\nCal.4th at p. 193.) For this reason, the defendant bears the burden of establishing a prima\nfacie case of purposeful discrimination. (People v. Arias (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134-135;\nPeople v.

Alvarez, supra, 14 Cal.4th at\np. 193.) To do so, the defendant must raise this issue “ ‘ “in timely fashion and make a\nprima facie case of such discrimination to the satisfaction of the court. First, . . . he\nshould make as complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible. Second, he must\nestablish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group within the\nmeaning of the representative cross-section rule. Third, from all the circumstances of the\ncase he must show a strong likelihood [or reasonable inference] that such persons are\nbeing challenged because of their group association . . . .” ’ [Citations.]” (People v.

Box, supra, 23\nCal.4th at p. 1188.) The fact that a prosecutor is permitted to make a record of his\njustifications for exercising a peremptory challenge does not change this basic rule.\n(Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                               34\n\f       On appeal, we must determine whether substantial evidence supports the trial\ncourt’s conclusion. (People v. McDermott (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2638433\"><a href=\"/opinion/2638433/people-v-mcdermott/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970.) Because it does,\nwe reject defendant’s argument.\n       Here, the trial court found that defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of\ndiscriminatory intent. Substantial evidence supports the court’s conclusion that the\ntotality of the relevant facts did not “give rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.”\nFirst, the fact that the People made an effort—and a vigorous one at that—to rehabilitate\nanother African-American juror points to the People’s lack of a “discriminatory purpose”\nin its exercise of a peremptory challenge to Juror No. 5. Simply put, if the prosecutor had\nsuch a purpose, we would not expect the prosecutor to make a case against excusing a\ndifferent African-American juror.\n       The People also point out that the prosecutor earlier passed on a jury that actually\ncontained Juror No. 5. The prosecutor did not actually exercise a peremptory challenge\nagainst Juror No. 5 until a juror on the original panel had to be excused and jury selection\nresumed. Although more than one inference can be drawn from the fact that the\nprosecutor had earlier passed on Juror No. 5 and did not excuse him until jury selection\nwas reopened, one reasonable inference—and the inference the trial court made—is that\nthe prosecutor was not concerned with the race of jurors in his selection decisions.\nSubstantial evidence, therefore, supports the trial court’s finding that defense failed to\nmake out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection.19\n       Defendants, however, argue that, when we take into account the prosecutor’s “for\nthe record” explanation for his prima facie challenge, an explanation the trial court\n\n\n\n       19\n         Defendants correctly argue that their burden of making out a prima facie case\ncan be met even as to a single peremptory challenge to an African-American juror.\n(People v. Thomas (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474.) However, although the People argue to\nthe contrary, the trial court did not base its conclusion that no prima facie case was shown\non the fact that the prosecutor only excused one African-American juror. In any event,\nour review of the record indicates that substantial evidence supports the trial court’s\nconclusion.\n\n\n                                             35\n\fcorrectly observed was irrelevant to its determination of whether defendant had made out\na prima facie, we must find that the trial court erred. We disagree.\n       A trial court does not scrutinize a prosecutor’s explanation for his exercise of a\nperemptory challenge until after it concludes that the defendant has made out a prima\nfacie case of discrimination. The trial court’s prima facie ruling here was explicitly—and\ncorrectly—not based on the prosecutor’s stated rationale, which came after the court\nmade its ruling. We do not consider such a statement when we ask whether substantial\nevidence supports the court’s ruling on the question of whether defendants had met their\nprima facie burden. (People v. Box, supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 1188, disapproved on another\nground in People v. Martinez (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637824\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637824/people-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 948, fn. 10; People v.

Thus, while we consider the “entire record of voir dire” in our\nreview (People v. Box, supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 1188), once we “ ‘conclude[] that the trial\ncourt properly determined that no prima facie case was made, [we] need not review the\nadequacy of counsel’s justifications for the peremptory challenges.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       The cases on which defendants rely in making the contrary argument involve\nsituations in which the trial court had either explicitly or implicitly found that the\ndefendant had made a prima facie case. These inapposite cases, therefore, are not helpful\nto defendants.\n       In Kesser v. Cambra (9th Cir. 2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795920\"><a href=\"/opinion/795920/richard-craig-kesser-v-steven-j-cambra-jr-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360, the court implicitly found\nthat defense counsel had made out a prima facie case of discrimination and was,\ntherefore, concerned with the ultimate question of whether the lower court erred in\nfinding that the prosecutor had not exercised his peremptory challenges in a\ndiscriminatory way. Similarly, in Crittenden v. Ayers (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178586\"><a href=\"/opinion/178586/crittenden-v-ayers/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950\n(Crittenden), the court registered its agreement with the California Supreme Court’s\nearlier decision in the matter that “Crittenden made a prima facie showing of\ndiscrimination and that the state carried its burden of articulating a race-neutral\njustification for the peremptory strike.” Crittenden, therefore, does not support\ndefendants’ argument regarding the trial court’s analysis of the record at the prima facie\n\n\n                                              36\n\fstage. Finally, in Johnson v. Vasquez (9th Cir. 1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629069\"><a href=\"/opinion/629069/andre-johnson-v-daniel-b-vasquez-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1329, footnote 2\n(Vasquez), the court announced that it “need not address the question whether Johnson\noffered prima facie evidence of intentional discrimination [citation], because the\nprosecutor offered an explanation for the challenge, and the trial court ruled on the\nultimate question of discrimination. [Citation.]” The Vasquez court, therefore, did not\nanalyze the issue of whether the defendant had made out a prima facie case because the\ntrial court had impliedly ruled that a prima facie case had been shown. Given that the\ndefendant had met his burden, the court of appeal looked only at the “ultimate question of\ndiscrimination,” an inquiry that does involve scrutiny of the prosecutor’s explanation for\nhis challenge.\n       Here, in contrast to Kesser, Crittenden, and Vasquez, the trial court explicitly ruled\nthat defendants had not met their burden of showing a prima facie case, and correctly did\nnot consider the prosecutor's explanation for his peremptory challenge.20 Therefore,\nwhen we consider this issue, we look only at the record before the trial court at the time it\nmade its prima facie case ruling.\nF.     Corroboration of Sanchez Testimony\n       Mota also argues that Sanchez—whom the trial court found was an accomplice as\na matter of law—was not adequately corroborated as required by section 1111 and,\ntherefore, the jury could not have relied on it to reach its verdicts. We disagree.\n       With regard to the Centron murder, Sanchez’s testimony regarding Molina’s role\nas the shooter was confirmed by Molina’s admission to his mother that he had, in fact,\nshot Centron. Sanchez’s testimony regarding the McIntosh murder to the effect that\nMota told him he had shot someone that night, was corroborated by the testimony of\nDetective David Hoff that he had found the gun Gomez used in the shooting in\nMenendez’s bedroom. In addition, Contra Costa County Deputy Sheriff Criminalist\nTerreance Wong’s expert testimony that the gun recovered from Menendez’s bedroom\n\n\n       20\n          The prosecutor’s decision to put these reasons “on the record,” following the\ntrial court’s decision regarding the prima facie case issue does not alter this procedure.\n\n\n                                             37\n\fwas the weapon used to shoot McIntosh corroborated Sanchez’s testimony regarding the\nshooting. Moreover, even if Sanchez’s testimony was not admissible, our review of the\nrecord indicates that there was ample evidence, particularly from the testimony of\nMenendez, Ruelas, Cervantes and Valencia to support defendants’ convictions.\nG.      Admissibility of Mota's Booking Statements Regarding Gang Membership\n        1.       Facts\n        On May 3, 2008, after he was arrested, Mota was taken to the Contra Costa\nCounty’s Martinez detention facility. When an arrestee such as Mota first arrives at the\ndetention facility, an “escort deputy” meets him and asks three questions. “They will ask\nthem if they have been here before. That will aid the booking officer in bringing up their\ninformation. [¶] They will ask them if they have any gang affiliations so that they\nknow . . . where to put them once they come inside of intake. [¶] And then they will ask\nthem if they have any fears for their safety.” If a suspect reports any fear for his safety,\nrequests protective custody or if they belong to a gang “they will go into one of the rooms\nto await . . . the processing . . . .”\n        Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Deputy Michael Rector and Deputy Gonzalez,21\nwere the “back door intake” deputies that evening and the first deputies Mota\nencountered when he arrived at the detention facility. Upon his arrival, Mota was put in a\nseparate room. When Rector told Mota he was going to search him for contraband, Mota\n“began to laugh nervously.” Mota then said, “man, I’m in here for some shit that I didn’t\ndo. They said that I killed someone, but it wasn’t me. I was there, but I didn’t kill\nanyone. The guy that did it is already in jail. He confessed already, but now he is trying\nto bring me down too . . . .” Mota became agitated and said, “I’m a gang banger, but I’m\nnot a murderer.” He then told Rector that “I told those other cops that I didn’t know\nanything because I thought I would be in trouble, but now I don’t care . . . .” Rector\nasked Mota if he wanted to talk to a San Pablo Police detective. Mota replied, “Yeah, I\n\n\n\n        21\n             Deputy Gonzalez did not testify.\n\n\n                                                38\n\fwill, but first I should talk to my lawyer. After I talk to him I will tell you guys what\nreally went down . . . .”\n       Rector did not ask Mota about his gang affiliation. He did, however, understand\nthat Mota was involved in a gang, based on earlier statements Mota had made to Deputy\nGonzalez, who was working alongside him that evening.\n       Mota’s statements struck Rector as important to the San Pablo Police Department,\nso he wrote up a summary of the conversation in order to “assist them in their case.”22\n       Following Rector and Gonzalez’s interaction with Mota, Deputy Bryan Zaiser,\nwho worked in the facility’s classification unit, interviewed Mota. He did so because\nMota appeared to be gang affiliated. Zaiser would typically tell the arrestee that the\nclassification questions were for an “administrative purpose,” and “for their housing.”\nPrior to the interview, Zaiser did not read Miranda warnings to Mota, did not advise him\nthat he had a right to decline to answer the questions nor did he tell him he was required\nto answer the questions. Mota did not express any fear for his safety before the\ninterview.\n       Zaiser filled out a classification questionnaire when he spoke to Mota. Zaiser\nindicated on the questionnaire that Mota identified himself as “affiliated with the Sureño\nstreet gang,” and said he was “part of VFL, which is Varrio Frontero Loco,” and had\nbeen since he was 14 years old. According to Zaiser, Mota told him that he (Mota) was\nan active Sureño gang member.\n       At the time he interviewed him, Zaiser was aware that Mota had been charged\nwith murder.23 He did not know that Mota had been accused of killing a “suspected\nNorteño.”\n\n\n\n       22\n         Generally, when an arrestee identified himself as a gang member, the deputy\nwould write a “classification incident detail report,” which would then be forwarded to a\nsupervisor, who would forward the report to “the appropriate people.”\n       23\n         It was common for the arresting agency (in this case, the San Pablo Police to\nbring with them “booking paperwork with the charges they are booking the inmate for.”\n\n\n                                             39\n\f       Zaiser testified that, because of the risk of harm to an inmate suspected of killing a\nNorteño, he would not house that inmate in the general population, where Norteños were\nhoused. There was separate housing for Sureños.\n       Each of the murder charges against Mota alleged an enhancement for participating\nin a criminal street gang pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1). He was also\ncharged under section 182.5 with participating in a criminal street gang.\n       Before trial, Mota moved to suppress his admission of gang membership. He\nargued that because the sheriff’s deputies to whom he disclosed his gang affiliation knew\nor should reasonably have known that the questions about his gang affiliation were likely\nto elicit an incriminating response, they were required to give Miranda warnings before\nquestioning him.\n       The People contended that because none of the sheriff’s deputies who discussed\nwith Mota his gang status were actually aware that he had been charged with gang-related\ncrimes, the questions he was asked were part of a custodial interrogation for which no\nMiranda warnings were required.\n       In admitting this evidence, the court made a number of factual findings. First, it\nfound that “the sole purpose of this interview and the form is to ensure the safety of\ninmates and staff at the county jail. The information gathered is essential to maintain\nsecurity at the jail. . . . [¶] . . . [I]f the jail were to house rival gang members together at\nrandom it would pose a grave security risk to both the inmates and the staff. [¶] So I find\nthat it is a fundamental and essential obligation of the sheriff’s department to determine\nwhether it is dangerous to house any inmate with any other inmate or any gang member\nwith any rival gang member.”\n       The trial court stressed that although Zaiser knew that Mota had been charged with\nmurder, Zaiser was not aware of the gang enhancement and gang charges alleged against\nMota. The court found, therefore, that Zaiser “had no actual subjective intent to gather\nincriminating information.” The court also noted that Zaiser’s subjective intent was “not\nthe standard but it is a relevant factor.”\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\f       Zaiser did not, in the court’s opinion, “use any coercive tactics, that is, no threats,\nno promises. There was no threat that if . . . Mr. Mota didn’t answer the questions, that\nhe would be housed with Norteños.” With regard to Mota’s understanding of the purpose\nof these questions, the court found “that Mr. Mota would have every reason to make sure\nthat the deputies knew to house him with Sureños. It would be in Mr. Mota’s wholly\npersonal interest in self-preservation that he be classified correctly. And it would be\nextreme danger to his life if he were not classified correctly and housed with other\nSureños. [¶] So my view is that Mr. Mota would have wanted the deputies to know that\nhe was a Sureño so his life would not be imperiled. And I believe he willingly and\nvoluntarily answered the questions for that reason.”\n       The court denied the motion to dismiss and Mota’s admission of gang membership\nwas admitted at trial. The jury ultimately found Mota guilty of the street gang conspiracy\ncharge and also found the street gang enhancements true as to the three charged\nhomicides of which he was found guilty.\n       2.     Discussion\n       Mota contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the\nstatements he made during his classification interview. He argues that this interview\nconstituted a custodial interrogation and, therefore, the law enforcement personnel he\nspoke with were required to read him his Miranda rights. We agree.\n       In Rhode Island v.

The Innis court held that “ ‘interrogation’ under\nMiranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the\npart of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the\npolice should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the\nsuspect.”24 (Innis, supra, 446 U.S. at p. 301.) Accordingly, “[a] practice that the police\n\n       24\n          The court also noted that “[t]he latter portion of this definition focuses primarily\nupon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus\nreflects the fact that the Miranda safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody\n\n                                              41\n\fshould know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect . . .\namounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the\nunforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend\nonly to words or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were\nreasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.” (Innis, supra, 446 U.S. at pp. 301-\n302.)\n        Ten years later, in Pennsylvania v.

[Citations.] The booking procedure,\nas defined by statute (Pen. Code, § 7, subd. 21), has been described as ‘essentially a\nclerical process.’ [Citation.] The limited information needed at a booking procedure is\nrequired solely for the purposes of internal jail administration, not for use in connection\nwith any criminal proceeding against the arrestee. When use of this information is\nconfined to those proper purposes, its elicitation cannot be considered incriminatory.”\n       The Rucker court went on to hold, however, that although Miranda warnings\n“need not be given at a booking interrogation” intended to elicit “from an arrestee the\nbasic, neutral information that is necessary for proper jail administration, [the state is\nforbidden to use] the arrestee’s responses in any manner in a subsequent criminal\nproceeding.”26 The court explained that “[i]t is not just the nature of the information\nrevealed but the potential for incrimination under all the circumstances that is important.\nIn the present case, appellant had been arrested for a homicide.

In that case, a suspect in custody told a\npolice officer during his intake interview that he needed protection because an\nunidentified inmate had threatened to stab him. (Id. at p. 183.) When one of the officers\nasked why he had been threatened, defendant responded “ ‘[b]ecause I killed two\nHispanics.’ ” (Id. at p. 184.) Another officer recalled asking defendant what his crime\nwas. The officer noted defendant’s statement that he had killed two Hispanics in an\ninterview intake report that he did not provide to any investigating agency. (Id. at p.\n184.) The statement was ultimately used at trial against the defendant.\n        The Williams court held that defendant's un-Mirandized admission that he had\n“killed two Hispanics” fell under the booking exception to Miranda. In so doing, the\ncourt cited the Innis court's definition of interrogation: “ ‘[T]he term “interrogation”\nunder Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on\nthe part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the\npolice should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the\nsuspect. . . . [T]he Miranda safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an\nadded measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective\nproof of the underlying intent of the police. . . . [S]ince the police surely cannot be held\naccountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of\ninterrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they\nshould have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.’ ” (Innis,\nsupra, 446 U.S. at pp. 301-302, fns. omitted.).”) (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 186-\n187.)\n\n\n\n                                             44\n\f       The court, citing People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630, then noted\nthat the “governing considerations” in determining whether questions fall within the\nbooking exception are as follows: “’ In determining whether a question is within the\nbooking question exception, courts should carefully scrutinize the facts surrounding the\nencounter to determine whether the questions are legitimate booking questions or a\npretext for eliciting incriminating information. [Citation.] Courts have considered\nseveral factors, including the nature of the questions, such as whether they seek merely\nidentifying data necessary for booking [citations]; the context of the interrogation, such\nas whether the questions were asked during a noninvestigative clerical booking process\nand pursuant to a standard booking form or questionnaire [citations]; the knowledge and\nintent of the government agent asking the questions [citations]; the relationship between\nthe question asked and the crime the defendant was suspected of committing [citations];\nthe administrative need for the information sought [citations]; and any other indications\nthat the questions were designed, at least in part, to elicit incriminating evidence and\nmerely asked under the guise or pretext of seeking routine biographical information\n[citations].’ [Citation.]” (Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 187.)\n       The Williams court concluded that Williams’ “intake interview at Folsom Prison\nwas closely analogous to the process of being booked into jail.” The court pointed out\nthat not only did the officers have no intention of eliciting an incriminating response, but\nthe follow up questions they asked were not ones they should reasonably have expected\nto elicit an incriminating response. The court explained: “Whether it was White or Reed\nwho asked defendant either ‘why are they going to stab you?’ (as White remembered), or\n‘what his crime was’ (as Reed recalled), neither question was designed to elicit an\nincriminating response.” The officers were appropriately responding to defendant's own\nsecurity concern, and would not reasonably have expected him to produce a confession.\n(Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 188.)\n       Turning now to this case, we begin by noting that the trial court found that\nalthough the deputies were aware that Mota had been charged with murder, they were not\nspecifically aware that, in addition to murder, Mota had been charged with an\n\n\n                                             45\n\fenhancement and an additional crime based on his gang membership. Therefore, they did\nnot ask Mota this question in order to elicit an incriminating response. However, as the\ntrial court recognized, whether a particular question was intentionally designed by the\npolice to evoke an incriminating response is only one fact the court looks at in\ndetermining whether words or actions on the part of a police officer constitute an\ninterrogation. Innis, Muniz and Williams all make clear that an officer’s subjective intent\nin asking a question is neither the only fact nor the determinative fact the court should\nconsider in determining whether a question falls within the booking exception.\nTherefore, even if a question was not intended to evoke an incriminating response, if it\nwas a question the officer should have reasonably expected to evoke such a response it\nwould fall outside the booking exception.\n       Here, the deputy who asked Mota whether he belonged to a gang “should [have]\nknow[n]” that question was “reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response . . . .”\n(Muniz, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 601.) Section 186.22, which imposes criminal penalties for\nparticipation in a criminal street gang, is part of the California Street Terrorism\nEnforcement and Prevention Act enacted in 1988. This enhancement had been in\nexistence for more than 20 years before Mota was questioned, and it is unlikely that the\ndeputy was unaware that participation in a criminal street gang is a felony or that an\naffirmative answer to the question would be incriminating. Similarly, section 182.5,\nwhich imposes an additional penalty for conspiracy to commit a felony by active\nparticipants in a criminal street gang, was added by section 3 of Proposition 21, the Gang\nViolence and Juvenile Crime Prevention Act of 1998, which was effective on March 8,\n2000. In light of the length of time these laws had been on the books, a law enforcement\nprofessional should have known that an incoming inmate’s admission of gang\nmembership could well be incriminating.\n       It was also unlikely that the deputy would be unaware of the possibility that Mota\nmight be a gang member and thus particularly likely to give an incriminating response to\nthis question. The trial court found that this facility housed a large population of gang\nmembers, so many that they created a serious and real risk to the safety of inmates in\n\n\n                                             46\n\frival gangs as well as to the deputies themselves. A law enforcement official working in\nthis milieu would not only be particularly likely to be aware of laws designed to deter\nsuch violence, he would also be aware that many inmates coming into the facility might\nbelong to gangs. In such a setting, the possibility that an inmate’s gang affiliation might\nbe incriminating was neither abstract nor remote. Therefore, the deputies should have\nknown that asking for this information was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating\nresponse from Mota. And, of course, it did.27\n       Nor did this question seek “routine biographical information” that would fall\nwithin the booking exception to Miranda. The nature of the information for which this\nexception is intended to apply is aptly demonstrated by the cases the Muniz plurality\nrecognized as establishing this exception and by Muniz itself. The pre-Muniz cases cited\nby that court involve questions designed to gather “mere pedigree information” or\n“routine background information.” (United States v.

One’s name, address, date of birth, length of marriage,\nnumber of children seldom relate “even tangentially to a crime.” Nor would they\ngenerally be expected to incriminate a defendant.\n       Here, in contrast, the fact that a suspect in custody is a member of a gang often\ncarries with it penal consequences. This information cannot be characterized as “mere\npedigree” such as a name, address, or birthdate. (Burns, supra, 684 F.2d at p. 1076.) It\n“could be [and was] incriminating at trial” (ibid.) and, as such, is not routine background\ninformation of the sort that has been considered outside the Miranda safeguards. Nor is it\nthe case that a question falls within the booking exception simply because it is routinely\nasked during the booking process. As the court noted in United States v. Williams, supra,\n878 F.Supp.2d at page 210, “the mere timing of the question is insufficient to make it a\nlegitimate booking question.” Nor is it the case that the characterization of this question\nas “administrative” makes it a routine booking question. As the court in Williams\nobserved, “asking Maurice Williams how he had arrived at the police station falls outside\nthe routine identifying questions contemplated by the booking question exception. His\nmode of transportation on that particular day is not a personal identifying characteristic,\nnor was his answer necessary to serve a required property seizure receipt.”\n       United States v.

Although\nWashington involved a booking procedure in which that information was requested, the\nchallenged evidence was not a defendant’s self-identification as a gang-member. Rather,\nthe court considered a question that asked defendant for his “gang moniker,” or\nnickname. The court ruled that this question fell within the routine booking exception\nbecause “[q]uestions about a person’s identity are not unconstitutional even if\n\n\n                                             48\n\fidentification of the person may help lead to the prosecution of that person for a crime.”\n(Id. at p. 1133.) Therefore, the court rejected defendant’s contention that his nickname\nshould be suppressed, ruling that such a request “is no different from simply asking for a\nsuspect’s name.” (Ibid.) The question asked Mota was not comparable to the identifying\nquestions the Washington court ruled did not constitute interrogation. Mota was not\nbeing asked to reveal his name when he was asked whether he belonged to a gang. And\ncertainly the fact of gang membership is not “routine” identifying information.\nTherefore, Washington is of no assistance to the People.\n       The People also point out that in People v.

The Gomez court appears to have based its\nconclusion on a footnote in Muniz, in which the court agreed with amicus United States\nthat “ ‘[r]ecognizing a “booking exception” to Miranda does not mean, of course, that\nany question asked during the booking process falls within that exception. Without\nobtaining a waiver of the suspect’s Miranda rights, the police may not ask questions,\neven during booking, that are designed to elicit incriminatory admissions.’ ” (Muniz,\nsupra,496 U.S. at p. 602, fn. 14.)\n       Muniz, however, does not hold that the only type of question asked during booking\nthat falls outside the routine booking exception is one which is “ ‘designed to elicit\nincriminatory admissions.’ ” (Muniz, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 602, fn. 14.) Were this the\ncase, the court’s language regarding questions the police “should know” might elicit an\nincriminating response would be meaningless, given that something an officer “should\nknow” is something he did not, in fact, subjectively know. (Id. at p. 601.) The Gomez\ncourt recognizes that often an officer’s subjective intent is quite relevant to this issue.\nIndeed, it is determinative in those situations in which the officer clearly designed the\nquestion with an interrogative intent. But even if an officer does not intend to elicit an\nincriminating response, and has not designed the question to do so, a question can still\n\n\n\n                                              49\n\fconstitute interrogation subject to the Miranda protections if the officer should have\nknown this question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\n       When answering this question, Mota had two choices. He could either admit to\ngang membership and incriminate himself or he could lie or refuse to answer the question\nand risk physical injury when he was housed with Norteño inmates.28 We know of no\nother case involving the routine booking exception where the defendant was asked to\nchoose between incriminating himself or risking serious physical injury. The price of\nprotecting oneself from harm while in custody should not be incriminating oneself.\n       This is not to say the question cannot or should not be asked. We fully expect the\npolice to continue to use it upon booking in order to protect jail personnel and inmates\nfrom harm. We hold only that the answer to this question may not be used against the\ndefendant at trial, as it was here, in the absence of Miranda warnings.\n       3.     Prejudice\n       The trial court’s error in admitting this testimony was, however, harmless beyond\na reasonable doubt under Chapman v. California (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, because Mota’s\ngang membership was convincingly established by many other sources. Ruelas, Sanchez\nand Menendez all testified that, based on their familiarity with Mota as fellow gang\nmembers and/or friends, Mota was a member of Varrio Frontero Loco. In addition, San\nPablo Police Officer Robert Brady, who testified as an expert oin Norteño and Sureño\ncriminal street gangs, opined that Mota was a gang member. He did so based on\ninformation he had received from other gang members. He also based his opinion on a\n\n       28\n         The trial court specifically found that “[t]here was no threat that if . . . Mr. Mota\ndidn’t answer the questions, that he would be housed with Norteños.” But there was no\nneed to make this threat. It was a fact that if Mota did not answer this question he would\nbe housed with Norteños. As the court found, “Mr. Mota would have every reason to\nmake sure that the deputies knew to house him with Sureños. It would be in Mr. Mota’s\nwholly personal interest in self-preservation that he be classified correctly. And it would\nbe extreme danger to his life if he were not classified correctly and housed with other\nSureños. [¶] So my view is that Mr. Mota would have wanted the deputies to know that\nhe was a Sureño so his life would not be imperiled. And I believe he willingly and\nvoluntarily answered the questions for that reason.”\n\n\n                                              50\n\f2005 robbery Mota had committed in Willows in which Mota wore a blue bandana (the\nSureño color). When he was committed to county jail following his arrest for this\nrobbery, he was observed “throwing up” a hand sign that signified his Sureño status.\nFinally, in photographs taken of Mota at Victor Valencia’s funeral, Mota made similar\ngang signs. Because Mota’s gang affiliation was amply established by evidence other\nthan the statements made by him during booking, any error is harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nH.     Unjoined Perpetrators of Same Crime\n       Defendants argue that the trial court erred in giving the jury CALJIC No. 2.11.5.\nThe instruction is as follows: “There has been evidence in this case indicating that a\nperson other than a defendant was or may have been involved in the crime for which that\ndefendant is on trial. [¶] There may be many reasons why that person is not here on trial.\nTherefore, do not speculate or guess as to why the other person is not being prosecuted in\nthis trial or whether [he] [she] has been or will be prosecuted. Your sole duty is to decide\nwhether the People have proved the guilt of the defendant on trial.” The use note to this\ninstruction states: “Do not use this instruction if the other person is a witness for either\nthe prosecution or the defense.”\n       Defendants argue that this instruction permitted the jury, when evaluating the\ncredibility of the five informant witnesses, to ignore the fact that they were all given deals\nof one kind or another. The issue of whether it was error to give this instruction in a trial\nin which unjoined coperpetrators testified was addressed most recently in People v.\nFonseca (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2283393\"><a href=\"/opinion/2283393/people-v-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fonseca). In that case, the trial court gave the\n1996 version of CALJIC No. 2.11.529 The court held that this iteration of the instruction\nremoved any\n\n       29\n          The Fonseca court noted that the cases finding it was error to give this\ninstruction in a trial in which an unjoined coperpetrator testified involved earlier versions\nof CALJIC No. 2.11.5. (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 548.) In addition, the\nFonseca court noted that even when there was a finding of error as to the earlier version\nof CALJIC NO. 2.11.5, “in every case where the jury receives all otherwise appropriate\ngeneral instructions regarding witness credibility, there can be no prejudice from jury\n\n                                              51\n\f“lingering possibility that a reasonable juror would misunderstand his or her duty to\nconsider all relevant factors bearing on witness credibility. Therefore, we hold that\nCALJIC No. 2.11.5, in its 1996 version, is not erroneous when given in a trial where an\nunjoined coperpetrator testifies.” (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 550.)\n       The trial court in this case gave the 2004 version of CALJIC No. 2.11.5, which\nwas revised to incorporate the Fonseca court’s suggestion that the “the 1996 instruction\nwould get closer to the heart of the matter if, instead of the italicized words[30] the phrases\n‘speculate upon’ or ‘guess at,’ or words to that effect were substituted.” The jury in this\ncase, therefore, was instructed with a version of CALJIC No. 2.11.5 that would not\nsuggest to a juror that he no longer had a “duty to consider all relevant factors bearing on\nwitness credibility.” (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 550.) We agree with the\nFonseca court’s reasoning regarding this instruction and, therefore, reject defendants’\nargument that the trial court erred in giving it.\nI.     Post-Crime Jail Incidents Used to Establish Gang Membership\n       Several weeks after he was incarcerated, and about a month after the last charged\nhomicide, Mota was involved in an incident in which he and Luii Hernandez attacked\nJorge Sanchez, one of the informants in this case, shortly before the end of “free time” in\nthe Q module, where Sureños are housed. After the fight, Sanchez was separated from\n\n\ninstruction pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.11.5. In other words, the potentially prejudicial\neffect of this instruction in the context of the testifying unjoined coperpetrator lies not in\nthe instruction itself, but in the rather remote possibility that the trial court would fail to\ngive otherwise pertinent and required instructions on the issue of witness credibility. (§\n1127; see also CJER Mandatory Criminal Jury Instructions Handbook (CJER, 11th ed.\n2002) §§ 2.4, 2.96, pp. 13, 76.) There is no error in giving CALJIC No. 2.11.5 so long as\na reasonable juror, considering the whole of his or her charge, would understand that\nevidence of criminal activity by a witness not being prosecuted in the current trial should\nbe considered in assessing the witness's credibility. [Citation.]” (Fonseca, supra, 105\nCal.App.4th at pp. 549-550.) Defendant does not argue that the trial court failed to give\nthese “otherwise pertinent and required instructions on the issue of witness credibility.”\n       30\n         The italicized words to which the court referred were that the jury not “discuss”\nor “give any consideration” as to why the unjoined coperpetrator was not being\nprosecuted in the trial. (Fonseca, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 548.)\n\n\n                                              52\n\fMota and Hernandez and not “let out” with the Sureños again. Eventually, Sanchez\nreached a deal with the prosecutor and entered a witness protection program.\n       Defense counsel sought to have evidence of this fight excluded. The prosecution\nargued that the evidence was admissible to show Mota acted “in concert with other gang\nmembers to accomplish certain goals.” The trial court ultimately admitted evidence of\nthe fight between Sanchez, Mota and Hernandez. It found that the May 24 incident was\n“relevant to Mr. Mota’s gang membership, his conduct and participation in these crimes\non behalf of the gang. So it’s relevant to gang membership and motive and intent for the\ncharged crimes.” He explained that “[Evidence Code section] 1101(b) would permit\nadmission of this . . . because it’s proof of motive and intent.” In addition, “the fact that\nit’s one month later [than the last homicide committed before Mota’s arrest] in my view\nwas not so remote to make it irrelevant.”31\n       Jorge Sanchez testified about the fight.32 According to Sanchez, after he was\narrested, he was placed in the Q module, where Sureños were housed. During free time,\nMota and Hernandez approached him. Mota hit him in the head and Sanchez fought\nback. The deputy maced them and Sanchez got on the floor when the deputy told him to.\nMota did not. Instead, he got on top of Sanchez, who fought back again. After this\nincident, Mota was “rolled up to B module.” He explained that this occurred “just so you\nain’t no good no more.”\n       Sheriff’s Deputy Jesus Garcia testified that on May 24, 2008, he was assigned to\nthe Q Module at the Martinez Detention facility. Mota, Hernandez and Sanchez were let\nout with the other Sureños on the Q Module. Although the Q Module housed “a variety\n       31\n          The court ruled that an admission Mota made after the attack to the effect that\nhe had “done the beatings and that he was still down on Sureños in the sense that he\ncould still be housed with Sureños ” was not admissible because it was not preceded with\nMiranda warnings.\n       32\n          Sanchez testified without objection before the court’s ruling on this issue. Any\nclaim of error with regard to the admission of his testimony has, therefore, been waived.\nIn anticipation of an ineffective assistance of counsel argument, we nevertheless consider\nwhether Sanchez’s testimony, which was similar to that of Deputy Garcia, was\nadmissible.\n\n\n                                              53\n\fof administrative segregation inmates as well as protective custody inmates,” Sureños\nwere let out “alone by themselves.”\n       Mota contends that evidence that he and another Sureño gang member attacked a\nSureño informant while they were in jail was not relevant to the issue of whether he was\nan active participant in a criminal street gang at the time the crimes in this case were\ncommitted because Mota could have joined the Sureños gang after he arrived in prison\nand as a matter of self-preservation or camaraderie. He further argues that the admission\nof this evidence was not permitted under either section 186.22 or the street gang\nenhancement because evidence of post-crime activities cannot be used to show a\nviolation of that statute. Finally, he argues that the admission of this evidence violated\nEvidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b), because it was used solely to show his bad\ncharacter. We disagree.\n       “We apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial\ncourt’s ruling on a relevance objection.” (People v. Kipp (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515770/people-v-kipp/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1123.)\n“ ‘Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency in reason to prove or disprove a disputed\nfact at issue.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 1123.) Evidence of Mota’s participation with\nanother Sureño in an attack on a “snitch” was relevant to the issue of whether he was a\ngang member at the time the murders were committed. The fact that he acted in concert\nwith another gang member was also relevant to the issue of whether in committing the\ncharged crimes he intended to “willfully promote[], further[], or assist[] in any felonious\ncriminal conduct by members of that gang . . . .” (§ 186.22, subd. (a).) The jury could\nreasonably infer from his behavior that both were, in fact, the case.33\n       Mota cites People v.

Prosecutorial Misconduct\n       1.     Absence of Evidence of Blood in Mota’s Car\n       Menendez testified that, while he was in Mota’s car in mid-April 2008, he shot\nhimself in the leg, causing significant bleeding. About a month later, Mota’s car was\nexamined by the police. This examination yielded no physical evidence to corroborate\nMenendez’s story: no blood, bullets or fingerprints were found. The car contained a\nchild seat and other baby items.\n       Mota’s counsel argued, during closing argument, that because there was no\nevidence of a gun-inflicted injury in Mota’s car, Menendez had lied when he testified\nabout this incident. Specifically, counsel told the jury that Mota’s car “was seized, it was\nsearched, and what was found in the car? Absolutely no blood. Not a single drop of\nblood. [¶] No forensic evidence whatsoever, despite the car’s having been seized and\nthoroughly searched. Not a drop of blood.” Defense counsel went on: “And we all know\nyou can’t clean up blood. And if you try to clean it up, you leave traces of chemicals.”\n       The prosecutor objected on the ground that these were facts not in evidence. The\ntrial court sustained this objection, pointing out that defense counsel’s assertion that an\n\n\n\n                                             55\n\feffort to clean up blood leaves chemical traces, “is not either common knowledge or in\nevidence.”\n       The prosecutor responded to defense counsel’s argument regarding the absence of\nevidence of any blood from Menendez’s self-inflicted wound. He told the jury that after\nMota dropped Menendez off at the hospital, it “makes sense that he [Menendez] went to\ngo clean it.” The court overruled defense counsel’s objection that there was “no evidence\nof that.” The trial court noted that the general rule that “[c]ounsel are permitted to ask\nthat the jury draw inferences from the evidence presented . . . .”\n       Defendants now argue that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he\nsuggested that the reason there was no blood in the back of the car might have been that\nMota cleaned up the blood. We reject this argument.\n       “The applicable federal and state standards regarding prosecutorial misconduct are\nwell established. ‘ “A prosecutor’s . . . intemperate behavior violates the federal\nConstitution when it comprises a pattern of conduct ‘so egregious that it infects the trial\nwith such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.’ ” (People v.\nGionis (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214; People v.

The argument may be vigorous as\nlong as it amounts to fair comment on the evidence, which can include reasonable\ninferences, or deductions to be drawn therefrom. [Citations.] It is also clear that counsel\nduring summation may state matters not in evidence, but which are common knowledge\nor are illustrations drawn from common experience, history or literature.’ [Citation.] ‘A\nprosecutor may “vigorously argue his case and is not limited to ‘Chesterfieldian\npoliteness’ ” ’ [citation], and he may ‘use appropriate epithets . . . .’ [Citation.]” (People\nv.

Neither was implausible. Certainly, when\nthere is an injury, particularly a gunshot wound, one might expect to find blood where the\ninjury occurred. The fact that no blood was found in Mota’s car lends itself to two\ninferences: that Menendez lied when he recounted the incident or Mota cleaned up the\nblood. What is important about both possibilities is that they amount to “ ‘ “fair\ncomment on the evidence, which can include reasonable inferences, or deductions to be\ndrawn therefrom.” ’ ” (People v. Williams, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 221.)\n       Nor is it the case, as defendant argues, that in asking the jury to infer that\nMenendez had cleaned the blood off the seat of his car, the prosecutor stated or implied\nfacts “for which there is no evidence before the jury.” (Heishman, supra, 45 Cal.3d at p.\n195.) In Heishman, our Supreme Court found that the where a prosecutor implied a\nconclusion based on evidence in the record, no misconduct took place. As in Heishman,\nthe prosecutor's argument was based on the facts before the jury—here, the fact that the\ncar was devoid of blood.\n       We also reject defendant’s argument that his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights to a fair trial and due process were violated because the trial court sustained the\nprosecutor’s objection to his statement regarding the chemical byproducts of cleaning up\nthe blood, and overruled his objection in which the prosecutor suggested Menendez had\ncleaned the blood off the seat. The two statements were not “equivalent,” as defendant\ncontends. Nor did the trial court err when it allowed one and not the other.\n       2.     Disparagement of Defense Lawyer During Rebuttal\n       Mota also argues that the prosecutor disparaged his truthfulness and integrity\nduring rebuttal closing argument.\n       In the first alleged instance, the prosecutor told a story his grandfather, a farmer,\ntold about a lawyer who was his neighbor. The farmer observed one day that the rope\ntying the goat in the lawyer’s yard had been chewed through and the farmer’s rose bushes\n\n\n                                              57\n\fhad been eaten. The farmer told the lawyer that the lawyer’s goat had eaten his rose\nbushes. The lawyer told the farmer “It wasn’t my goat. I don’t have a goat. [¶] If I do\nhave a goat, it didn’t eat your roses. [¶] If I do have a goat and it did eat your roses, it’s\nbecause the rose bushes made them eat the roses. [¶] If I do have a goat and it did eat\nyour roses . . . then the goat was insane.”\n       The prosecutor told the jury that this story illustrated that his grandfather “wasn’t\nthat happy that I was going to be a lawyer. And the point is, ladies and gentlemen, what\nare we here for? [¶] Are we here for the truth, or are we here just to throw everything\nout? What did you just hear from the defense for Mr. Mota? [¶] Well, ladies and\ngentlemen, you heard the following things: And it wasn’t stated explicitly to you because\n[defense counsel] didn’t want to come out and say that. [¶] How many defenses are there\nfor Mr. Mota? I don’t get it. My client wasn’t there. He may not have been there for the\n2-16 and 4-26 of ’08 killings. [¶] If my client was there, he didn’t know what these guys\nwere going to do. [¶] If my client was there and he did know what they were doing, and\nit wasn’t self-defense, it was imperfect self-defense so he is only guilty of voluntary\nmanslaughter. [¶] If my client was there and he did know what they were doing and it\nwasn't self-defense or imperfect self-defense, then the bullets fired by Javier Gomez did\nnot actually kill Rico McIntosh because you heard defendant Mota’s attorney cross-\nexamin[e] Mr. Ogan extensively. . . . [¶] If my client was there and he did know what\nthey were doing and it wasn’t self-defense or imperfect self-defense, and you do believe\nthe bullets fired by Gomez actually killed Mr. McIntosh, then my client is only guilty of\nlesser-included offenses that aren’t on the verdict forms, so he is not guilty.”\n       In telling this story, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct. Pointing out the\ninconsistencies and implausibilities of an opponent's argument is not an attack on the\nopponent’s personal integrity. (People v.

In People v. Medina, supra, 11 Cal.4th at page 759, the\ncourt found that the prosecutor did not demean defense counsel’s integrity when he told\n\n\n                                              58\n\fthe jury that “ ‘any experienced defense attorney can twist a little, poke a little, try to\ndraw some speculation, try to get you to buy something . . . .’ ” The Medina court\nobserved that “the prosecutor’s . . . argument was unobjectionable. To observe that an\nexperienced defense counsel will attempt to ‘twist’ and ‘poke’ at the prosecution’s case\ndoes not amount to a personal attack on counsel’s integrity.” (See also People v. Gionis,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218.)\n       Accordingly, we find no prosecutorial misconduct and reject defendants'\nargument.\nK.     Substantial Evidence of Murder and Conspiracy\n       Elizalde was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and murder. The People\ncharacterized Elizalde as the conspirator who “stay[ed] home . . . and [did] nothing,\nbut . . . started the design or agree[d] to the conspiracy . . . .” The People told the jury\nthat the testimony of Ruelas, Sanchez and Cervantes showed that Elizalde “was leading a\ncharge to attack rival gang members to bring the hood back.” The People’s theory was\nthat the conspiracy to commit murder in which Mota and Elizalde participated had as its\nobject the killing of rival gang members and the deaths of Centron, Perez and McIntosh\nwere, therefore, the “natural and probable consequences of a conspiracy. . . .”\n       Elizalde now argues that substantial evidence does not establish that the murders\nof Centron, Perez and McIntosh were a foreseeable consequence of a conspiracy in which\nElizalde and Mota participated.34 We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          Elizalde also contends that the only evidence supporting his convictions is the\nuncorroborated testimony of accomplice witnesses. As we have previously held, four of\nthe witnesses who testified regarding Elizalde’s participation in a conspiracy that led to\nthe murders of Centron, Perez and McIntosh were not, in fact, accomplices as a matter of\nlaw. Moreover, viewed in a light most favorable to the verdicts, the jury could have\neasily found that Valencia, Menendez, Cervantes and Ruelas were not accomplices and,\nthus, no corroboration was required. Finally, even if these witnesses were in fact\naccomplices, their testimony was adequately corroborated.\n\n\n                                              59\n\f       1.

To the extent\nthat a particular crime could be said to be “unplanned,” a conspirator is responsible for it\nif it was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy. “Whether the\nunplanned act was a ‘reasonably foreseeable consequence’ of the conspiracy must be\n‘evaluated under all the factual circumstances of the individual case’ and ‘is a factual\nissue to be resolved by the jury’ [citation], whose determination is conclusive if\nsupported by substantial evidence.” (People v.

Substantial Evidence of Conspiracy\n       Our review of the record indicates that substantial evidence supports the jury’s\nconclusion that (1) Elizalde conspired with Mota to reestablish Varrio Frontero Loco by,\namong other things, murdering rival gang members and (2) the deaths of Centron, Perez\nand McIntosh were the natural and probable consequence of that conspiracy.\n       Officer Brady of the San Pablo Police Department testified as a gang expert that in\nlate 2007 and early 2008, Varrio Frontero Loco and the Mexican Locos were beginning\nto “clique up” together. Based on several murders that occurred as well as informant\ninformation, he believed that Gamaliel Elizalde was the “head shot-caller” of Varrio\nFrontero Loco. The gang was recruiting members and committing murders. He believed\n\n\n                                             60\n\fElizalde and other members of Varrio Frontero Loco were attempting to “reestablish the\ngang.”\n         Sanchez testified that in the year leading up to the murders of Centron, Perez and\nMcIntosh, Elizalde was the leader of Varrio Frontero Loco. The gang was on the\ndecline—members were being hurt and territory was disappearing. To counteract this\nstate of affairs, Elizalde, along with Sanchez, Mota, Ruelas, and others, began to recruit\nnew members. They also embarked on a campaign to “do more damage to the\nNorteños.” Elizalde encouraged Varrio Frontero Loco members to make sure that the\nNorteños were aware that they were a present and powerful force by going into Norteño\nterritory to beat up or shoot anyone who appeared to be a Norteño. Menendez confirmed\nthat this was, indeed, the understanding of the Varrio Frontero Loco members who\n“wanted to get rid of Norteños.” Although Menendez was not sure, he believed that\nElizalde was the “shot-caller.” Ruelas confirmed Menendez’s suspicion regarding\nElizalde’s role in the Varrio Frontero Loco. Ruelas also testified that Molina told him\nthat they were “bringing the hood back” and violence against rival gang members was an\nimportant part of this effort.\n         In addition to substantial evidence that Elizalde was a significant player in a\nconspiracy to re-establish Varrio Frontero Loco as a powerful gang through violence—\nincluding murder—against Norteños, substantial evidence also supports the jury’s\nconclusion that the deaths of Centron, Perez and McIntosh were the foreseeable\nconsequence of the conspiracy to “bring[] the hood back.” Centron, Perez and McIntosh\nwere targeted because they appeared to be Norteños, the principal target of the Varrio\nFrontero Loco. Elizalde’s argument that these murders were not foreseeable because the\nvictims were outside Richmond, which was the area claimed by the Sureños, makes little\nsense. San Pablo was well known to be Norteño territory. Given that the Varrio Frontero\nLoco conspired to kill Norteños, they would generally do so in San Pablo, rather than\nRichmond.\n         The jury’s verdict, therefore, is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n                                               61\n\fL.     Telephone Conversations Between Molina and His Mother\n       Elizalde contends that portions of two telephone conversations—mainly between\nHector Molina (who was in jail at the time of the conversations) and his mother—but also\nin one instance involving Elizalde, were improperly admitted under Evidence Code\nsection 1223’s co-conspirator’s hearsay exception. We disagree.\n       1.     Factual Background\n       In the first of the two telephone calls, both of which occurred while he was\nincarcerated at the Martinez Detention Facility, Molina told his mother to contact\nElizalde (Gama) and tell him “that they got me in.” Hector’s mother replied, “[b]ut you\ndidn’t do it, if you didn’t do it!” and he replied “Well, yes, it was me. They already\nknow.” He told his mother to “Tell [Elizalde]. Ask [Elizalde] to help you. [Elizalde]\ncan help you. [Elizalde] will give me money as well. Tell [Elizalde] I’ve told him to\nsend me money.” Molina asked his mother to place a “three way” call to Elizalde. When\nElizalde did not answer, Molina left a message telling Elizalde that “they got me for\nmurder” and that “I need you to take care of my family . . . [t]ake care of my mama . . . .”\n       In the second call, Molina’s mother told him that Elizalde brought her $50. She\nalso told him that Elizalde told her that Molina “should say no, no, no, I didn’t do it, it\ncouldn’t have been me. I didn’t do anything. To keep your word, and no, no, no.”\nMolina’s mother placed another three way call to Elizalde. This time, Elizalde answered.\nHe instructed Molina, “whatever happened, you—you say that you don’t know, okay\nman?” Molina responded, “Yeah, man.” Elizalde then said “On your own, man, no. Just\ntell them no, you don't know and they can’t get you out of that.”\n       Elizalde sought to have evidence of these phone calls excluded on hearsay\ngrounds. The People argued that they were admissible under the co-conspirator\nexception to the hearsay rule pursuant to Evidence Code section 1223. The trial court\nfound that the People had “clearly made a prima facie case that the conspiracy described\nin the indictment existed. That the conspiracy was on-going in February and March of\n2008 at the time of the phone calls. That Mr. Elizalde was a leader of VFL or a shot-\ncaller for VFL and that Mr. Mota was a member of the conspiracy. And that Mr. Gomez\n\n\n                                              62\n\fwas also a member of the conspiracy.” The court pointed out that Gomez’s confession\n“can be considered as part of the prima facie case of his membership in the conspiracy.”\nAs Sureños, the “co-conspirators lived under a number of rules that are relevant to this\nanalysis. [¶] First, is never cooperate with police. Never give a confession. Never give a\nstatement. Never agree to testify. If you are arrested, fellow gang members will put\nmoney on your books to help you buy things in the jail which enables you to be more\ncomfortable and to increase your influence at the jail. [¶] The Sureños in the jail were\nrequired to contribute money or buy things for other Sureños in custody. And then\nSureños in custody were still required to assault Norteños at every opportunity. [¶] So\nthe culture of attacking rival gang members did not stop upon arrest.”\n       The court found that Molina was released following his arrest after the Centron\nmurder and “within days” he “immediately returned to the active participation in the\nconspiracy. Just an indication that mere arrests [of conspiracy members] does not\nnecessarily put their participation in the conspiracy at end.” The court did, however,\nredact numerous telephone conversations in which Molina was “talking about his general\nwelfare and that sort of thing.”\n       2.     Discussion\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found that the conspiracy was\nongoing. He contends that because Molina had already been arrested when the telephone\ncalls were made, the court could not conclude that he was involved in an ongoing\nconspiracy.\n       We review the trial court’s ruling under the abuse of discretion standard and will\nnot disturb it on appeal unless it was exercised in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor patently absurd and that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (People v. Rowland\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236733\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236733/people-v-rowland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nexcerpts from these telephone calls.\n       Evidence Code section 1223 provides that “a statement offered against a party is\nnot made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if: [¶] (a) The statement was made by the\ndeclarant while participating in a conspiracy to commit a crime or civil wrong and in\n\n\n                                             63\n\ffurtherance of the objective of that conspiracy; [¶] (b) The statement was made prior to\nor during the time that the party was participating in that conspiracy; and [¶] (c) The\nevidence is offered either after admission of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the\nfacts specified in subdivisions (a) and (b) or, in the court’s discretion as to the order of\nproof, subject to the admission of such evidence.”\n       As the proponent of the evidence, the People were required to “offer evidence\nsufficient for the trier of fact to determine that the preliminary fact, the conspiracy, is\nmore likely than not to have existed.” (People v. Herrera (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251064\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251064/people-v-herrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61.)\nThe Herrera court explains that “[a] conspiracy exists when one or more persons have\nthe specific intent to agree or conspire to commit an offense, as well as the specific intent\nto commit the elements of that offense, together with proof of the commission of an overt\nact by one or more of the parties to such agreement in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n[Citations.] These facts may be established through the use of circumstantial evidence.\n[Citations.] They may also ‘ “be inferred from the conduct, relationship, interests, and\nactivities of the alleged conspirators before and during the alleged conspiracy.\n[Citations.]” ’ [Citations.] [¶] Once the existence of the conspiracy has been\nindependently established, the offering party must then make three additional showings in\norder for the content of the coconspirator’s statement to be considered by the trier of fact.\nThat party must show: (1) that the declarant (who may or may not be the defendant) was\nparticipating in a conspiracy at the time of the declaration; (2) that the declaration was\nmade in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy; and (3) that at the time of the\ndeclaration the party against whom the evidence is offered was participating, or would\nlater participate, in the conspiracy. [Citations.]” (Id. at pp. 64-65.)\n       We turn now to this case. The court had before it evidence that when the telephone\ncalls were made—in February and March of 2008—Elizalde, who was not in custody at\nthe time, was the shot caller for Varrio Frontero Loco. Even in custody, a Sureño like\nMolina adhered to rules of behavior established by the gang. As the trial court put it:\n“First, is never cooperate with police. Never give a confession. Never give a statement.\nNever agree to testify. If you are arrested, fellow gang members will put money on your\n\n\n                                              64\n\fbooks to help you buy things in the jail which enables you to be more comfortable and to\nincrease your influence at the jail. [¶] The Sureños in the jail were required to contribute\nmoney or to buy things for other Sureños in custody.” Contrary to defendant’s argument\nthat the conspiracy among the parties to attack Norteños ended when Molina was\narrested, the court found that “Sureños in custody were still required to assault Norteños\nat every opportunity. [¶] So the culture of attacking rival gang members did not stop\nupon arrest.” In fact, when Molina was released following his arrest after the Centron\nmurder, “within days” he “immediately returned to the active participation in the\nconspiracy. Just an indication that mere arrests [of conspiracy members] does not\nnecessarily put their participation in the conspiracy at end.”\n       This evidence was sufficient to support a finding that it was more likely than not\nthat Molina and Elizalde were participants in a conspiracy when the telephone calls were\nmade and, therefore, the telephone calls were properly admitted.\nM.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n       The short answer to Elizalde’s argument that counsel was deficient for failing to\nobject to the admission of these telephone calls is that because (as we previously found)\nthis evidence was admissible, any objection would have been unavailing and, thus, the\nfailure to object did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

Ruelas’s MySpace Post\n       Luis Ruelas testified that he posted a message on his MySpace page in order to\nwarn gang members not to harm his family.

We do not agree that the\ninstruction could be construed as permitting the jury to use the MySpace post as\ncorroboration. The language of the instruction is broad enough to encompass this\nparticular communication. The instruction, therefore, did not violate his Sixth\nAmendment right to make a defense. (Estelle v.

Elizalde’s 2007 Methamphetamine Incident\n       As part of its showing of a predicate offense for the gang charge and gang\nenhancements, the People put in evidence of an incident involving Elizalde’s 2007\npossession of methamphetamine for sale. Elizalde objected to the admission of this\nevidence under Evidence Code section 352. He argued then, as he does now on appeal,\nthat the evidence was cumulative and more prejudicial than probative. The trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.\n       At trial, two police officers testified that they searched Elizalde’s home on July 18,\n2007. During that search, the officers discovered a trail of white crystals, which were\nlater identified as methamphetamine, leading from a bathroom to where Elizalde was\nstanding. In addition, the officers found the same white crystals around the top of the\ntoilet bowl rim, on the floor of the bathroom, and on Elizalde’s abdomen. The officers\nalso found indicia that Elizalde was selling drugs. These included small Ziploc baggies, a\ndigital scale, $755 cash in Elizalde’s pocket and “pay/owe” sheets. One of the officers,\nwho was qualified as an expert on the possession of narcotics for sale testified that in his\n\n\n                                             66\n\fopinion Elizalde possessed methamphetamine for sale and flushed it down the toilet.\nElizalde was arrested for possession of narcotics for sale and ultimately was convicted of\nonly possession.\n       The trial court admitted evidence of Elizalde’s conduct on this occasion to meet\nthe predicate crime requirements, finding that “the probative value is very high because\nthey are legitimate proof of essential elements of the crime and enhancements.” With\nregard to the prejudicial effect of this evidence, the court found that although the\nprejudicial effect of the evidence was substantial, a limiting instruction could mitigate\nthat effect.35\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence. Our\nSupreme Court recently considered a similar objection to gang evidence admitted to\nprove a predicate offense under section 186.22. The court explained that, in contrast to\nevidence admitted under Evidence Code section 1101 to show intent, motive or modus\noperandi, in which “ ‘evidence is probative because of its tendency to establish an\nintermediary fact from which the ultimate fact of guilt of a charged crime may be\ninferred. [Citations.]’ In prosecutions for active participation in a criminal street gang,\nthe probative value of evidence of a defendants gang-related separate offense generally is\ngreater because it provides direct proof of several ultimate facts necessary to a\nconviction. Thus, that the defendant committed a gang-related offense on a separate\noccasion provides direct evidence of a predicate offense, that the defendant actively\nparticipated in the criminal street gang, and that the defendant knew the gang engaged in\na pattern of criminal gang activity.” (People v. Tran (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844282\"><a href=\"/opinion/844282/people-v-tran/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048.) Not\n\n       35\n          The court did indeed give the jury limiting instructions regarding this evidence.\nAfter the two officers who searched Elizalde’s house testified, the court instructed the\njury that their testimony regarding Elizalde’s possession of methamphetamine for sale\nwas admissible only with regard to the gang count and gang enhancements. The court\nwarned the jury that the evidence was “not admissible to suggest the Mr. Elizalde . . . has\na bad character or a propensity to commit crimes, buy only on the predicate act elements\nof the gang charge and the gang enhancements . . . .” At the end of the trial, the court\ninstructed the jury on the use of evidence that was admitted for a limited purpose\n(CALJIC No. 2.09) and evidence of other crimes (CALJIC No. 2.50).\n\n\n                                             67\n\fonly is such evidence highly probative, but its prejudicial effect is comparatively weaker:\n“[T]he inherent prejudice from a defendant’s separate gang-related offense typically will\nbe less when the evidence is admitted to establish a predicate offense in a prosecution for\nactive participation in a criminal street gang, than when it is admitted to establish an\nintermediary fact from which guilt may be inferred. ‘Prejudice for purposes of Evidence\nCode section 352 means evidence that tends to evoke an emotional bias against the\ndefendant with very little effect on issues, not evidence that is probative of a defendant’s\nguilt.’ [Citations.] As we explained in People v. Doolin (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">: ‘ “The\nprejudice that section 352 ‘ “is designed to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a\ndefense that naturally flows from relevant, highly probative evidence.” [Citations.]\n“Rather, the statute uses the word in its etymological sense of ‘prejudging’ a person or\ncause on the basis of extraneous factors.” ’ ” ’ (Id. at p. 439.) That the evidence\nprovided direct evidence of some of the elements of the prosecution’s case thus does not\nweigh against its admission. In addition, because the prosecution is required to establish\nthe defendant was an active participant in a criminal street gang and had knowledge of\nthe gang’s criminal activities, the jury inevitably and necessarily will in any event receive\nevidence tending to show the defendant actively supported the street gang’s criminal\nactivities. That the defendant was personally involved in some of those activities\ntypically will not so increase the prejudicial nature of the evidence as to unfairly bias the\njury against the defendant. In short, the use of evidence of a defendant’s separate offense\nto prove a predicate offense should not generally create ‘an intolerable “risk to the\nfairness of the proceedings or the reliability of the outcome.” ’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nTran, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1048.)\n       The Tran court also addressed the contention Elizalde makes that evidence of his\npossession of narcotics for sale was cumulative of the evidence of other predicate\noffenses offered by the prosecution. “Defendant argues that evidence of a defendant’s\nseparate offense on another occasion should not be admitted when it is ‘cumulative.’ By\nthis he seems to mean that the evidence should not be admitted when the prosecution has\nthe ability to develop evidence of offenses committed on separate occasions by other\n\n\n                                             68\n\fgang members. But defendant cites no authority for the argument that the prosecution\nmust forgo the use of relevant, persuasive evidence to prove an element of a crime\nbecause the element might also be established through other evidence. The prejudicial\neffect of evidence defendant committed a separate offense may, of course, outweigh its\nprobative value if it is merely cumulative regarding an issue not reasonably subject to\ndispute. [Citations.] But the prosecution cannot be compelled to ‘ “present its case in the\nsanitized fashion suggested by the defense.” ’ [Citation.] When the evidence has\nprobative value, and the potential for prejudice resulting from its admission is within\ntolerable limits, it is not unduly prejudicial and its admission is not an abuse of discretion.\nFurther, a rule requiring exclusion of evidence of a defendant’s separate offense on the\ntheory the prosecution might be able to produce evidence of offenses committed by other\ngang members would unreasonably favor defendants belonging to large gangs with a\nsubstantial history of criminality. That the prosecution might be able to develop evidence\nof predicate offenses committed by other gang members therefore does not require\nexclusion of evidence of a defendant’s own separate offense to show a pattern of criminal\ngang activity.” (People v. Tran, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp.1048-1049.)\n       In our view, the evidence of Elizalde’s conduct on this occasion was not so\nprejudicial as to preclude its admission. The jury had before it evidence of numerous acts\nof violence committed by Elizalde and, in that context, evidence that he possessed\nmethamphetamine for sale can hardly be considered sufficiently prejudicial to outweigh\nits substantial probative value.\nP.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel For Failure to Object to “Other Crimes”\n       Evidence\n       Elizalde argues that counsel was ineffective because he did not object to the\nintroduction of evidence of Elizalde’s role in a number of crimes. He contends that this\nevidence was “devastating,” and therefore counsel’s failure to object violated the Sixth\nAmendment.\n       The evidence to which counsel did not object was: (1) testimony that Elizalde\ndirected Sanchez and Ruelas to kill a surviving witness to the Centron shootings; (2)\n\n\n                                              69\n\fevidence that “Weasal” who was a Varrio Frontero Loco shot caller from prison ordered\nElizalde to kill an informant and that although Elizalde did not want to do so, he sent\nsomeone to burn the informant’s house down; (3) the fact that Elizalde kept a hit list of\npeople whom he wanted killed and kept a stash of guns at his brother-in-law’s house; (4)\nRuelas’s description of an incident in which Elizalde asked Ruelas to kill someone who\nhad slashed his tires; and (5) Ruelas’s opinion that Elizalde was killing people “for no\nreason” and that he tried to persuade Elizalde to stop ordering so many shootings.\n       This evidence was highly relevant to establish Elizalde's position as the Varrio\nFrontero Loco shot caller and his participation in the conspiracy to kill Norteños.\nMoreover, given the amount of evidence of similar activity on Elizalde’s part it was not\nmore prejudicial than probative under Evidence Code section 352. Any objection\ncounsel might have made regarding the admission of this evidence would have been\nunavailing. In that case, the failure to object does not constitute ineffective assistance of\ncounsel. (People v. Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 952.)\nQ.     Cumulative Error (Elizalde)\n       Elizalde contends cumulative error in this case rises to the level of reversible and\nprejudicial error. (People v.
