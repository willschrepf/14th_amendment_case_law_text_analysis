Ct. No. 07CF2849\n____________________________________)\n\n\n      A jury convicted defendant Billy Joe Johnson of the first degree murder of\nScott Miller (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a)),1 and found true the special\ncircumstance allegations that the murder was committed by means of lying in wait\n(§ 190.2, subd. (a)(15)), and for the benefit of, or at the direction of, and in\nassociation with a criminal street gang (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(22)). The jury also\nconvicted defendant of conspiracy to commit murder (§§ 182, subd. (a)(1), 187,\nsubd. (a)), and as an accessory after the fact (§ 32), and found true a criminal street\ngang enhancement allegation as to all three counts. In connection with the murder\nand conspiracy counts, the jury further found true the allegation that a principal\ndischarged a firearm. After the jury rendered its guilt phase verdicts, the court\nconducted a court trial on the special circumstance allegation that defendant\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n\n\n                          SEE CONCURRING OPINION\n\fpreviously had been convicted of murder (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(2)), and found that\nallegation true. At the conclusion of the penalty phase trial, the jury returned a\nverdict of death. The court denied an automatic motion for modification of the\ndeath verdict to life without the possibility of parole (§ 190.4, subd. (e)), and\nsentenced defendant to death.2 Defendant‘s appeal is automatic. (§ 1239,\nsubd. (b).) For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.\n                                      I. FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase Evidence\n\n           1. Prosecution evidence\n\n                a. Events prior to the murder of Scott Miller\n       Scott ―Scottish‖ Miller was a founding member of an Orange County based\nWhite supremacist street gang called Public Enemy Number 1 (PEN1), which\nformed in the mid 1980s. By the mid to late 1990s, Miller‘s status within the gang\nhad diminished, and he had become marginalized.\n       In February 2001, a local television station aired two news segments about\nPEN1. The segments featured an interview with Miller, who spoke candidly about\nthe gang‘s activities, including its use of violence. Although news producers\nattempted to protect Miller‘s identity by disguising his face and voice, PEN1 gang\nmembers immediately recognized Miller by his tattoos, mannerisms, and the\nobjects around him, including his pit bull.\n\n\n\n2       Before ruling on the automatic motion to modify the verdict, the court\ngranted the prosecution‘s motion under section 1385 to dismiss various prior\nconviction allegations that previously had been bifurcated from the guilt phase of\ntrial but not resolved. The court later stayed, pursuant to section 654, sentence on\nthe conspiracy and accessory convictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f       The news segments were considered bad timing for PEN1, whose two main\nleaders were then being tried on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. As a\nresult of the broadcasts, PEN1 leadership put a ―green light‖ on Miller, marking\nhim for execution. On several occasions during the year that followed, Miller told\nhis girlfriend that he was concerned for his safety. According to one former gang\nmember, however, Miller was still ―running around‖ because no one had the\ncourage to deal with him. Shortly before March 2002, officers in the gang unit at\nthe Costa Mesa Police Department were actively looking for Miller to warn him\nthat they had received credible information that PEN1 members were planning to\nkill him.\n\n               b. The murder of Scott Miller\n       On the evening of March 8, 2002, a little over one year after the news\nsegments about PEN1, defendant‘s cousin hosted a party in Costa Mesa. Several\nmembers and associates of PEN1 attended the party, including Miller and\ndefendant, who had recently transitioned to PEN1 after a falling out with the Nazi\nLow Riders, a White supremacist prison gang. Although defendant had known\nMiller for decades, he had not seen Miller since the news broadcasts had aired.\nAccording to the testimony of a mutual friend who also attended the party, Miller\nand defendant were laughing together and joked about Miller keeping ―his guard\nup.‖\n       Around 10:30 p.m. on the night of the party, Miller‘s now ex-girlfriend\nreceived a voicemail message from him. He sounded concerned. In the\nbackground she heard voices, one of which she recognized as defendant‘s.\nAnother woman who previously had dated Miller saw him when she first arrived\nat the party at 10:00 p.m. But she left the party shortly thereafter to buy drugs and\nby the time she returned around 11:00 p.m., Miller was no longer there.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f       Earlier that day, PEN1 member Michael Lamb had called Christina Hughes\nat her Anaheim apartment. He was looking for Tanya Hinton, a PEN1 associate\nwho was staying there. Hughes told Lamb that Hinton was not at the apartment.\nHe responded, ―It is important, have her call me when she gets home.‖ Hughes\ngave Hinton the message when Hinton arrived at the apartment in the early\nevening, but told Hinton that she did not want any visitors coming to her place.\nShortly before 11:30 p.m., however, Hughes walked downstairs from the upper\nlevel of the two-story apartment and saw Hinton with Lamb and PEN1 member\nJacob Rump on the first floor. Both men had recently been released from prison.\nWhen Hughes demanded that they go, Hinton assured her the group was leaving,\nand Hughes went back upstairs. Minutes later, Hughes heard a single shot fired\noutside in the alley. A neighbor whose home faced the alley also heard a gunshot,\nfollowed by the sound of screeching tires. Sometime between 11:30 and\n11:35 p.m., Hughes and a friend went to the alley to investigate. She saw the dead\nbody of a man she did not recognize and a large amount of blood.\n       Police responded to the scene about 20 to 25 minutes after the shooting, and\nfound Miller‘s body facedown in the alley with blood coming from the head area.\nThere was a bloody baseball cap and soda can underneath Miller‘s head, which\nsuggested he had been surprised by the gunshot and dropped the items where he\nwas shot. In the blood, police found tire impressions that were heading away from\nthe location of the body. They also recovered a nine-millimeter Luger casing on\nthe ground 15 feet from the body.\n       An autopsy showed Miller had died from a single gunshot to the back of his\nhead, which lacerated his cerebellum and cerebrum. According to the forensic\npathologist, Miller probably lost consciousness immediately and death occurred\nwithin minutes. The absence of burning, singeing, stippling, or soot at the\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fentrance wound suggested the barrel of the gun was some distance from the skin,\nnot in contact with it.\n       The day after the shooting, defendant called Miller‘s former girlfriend,\nasking her if she had heard what happened. He told her that ―Scott is no longer\nwith us‖ and something to the effect that if she needed anything, he would be there\nfor her.\n       That same day, defendant spoke with his friend and fellow gang member\nDonald McLachlan about his involvement in Miller‘s death. Defendant told\nMcLachlan that he drove with Miller from the party in Costa Mesa to Anaheim,\ntelling Miller they were going to get drugs. Defendant also indicated that he was\nwalking next to Miller in the alley before he was killed. When Miller heard\nfootsteps coming from behind, he asked defendant, ―Are those PEN1 guys?‖ He\nwas then introduced to Lamb and Rump. According to defendant, Miller seemed\nresigned to the idea that something was going to happen to him.\n       Defendant identified Lamb as the shooter. He also told McLachlan that he\nwas angry and upset about the way the killing was handled and had confronted\nLamb about it. Describing Miller as a ―dear friend,‖ defendant thought Miller\nshould have been executed by a shot to the face, not to the back of the head. As\ndefendant envisioned the scenario, Miller should have been told to his face, ―You\nhad a good run, you ran afoul of the rules, it is time to go.‖ Defendant explained\nthat Miller had to be killed because of the news interview and ―his actions . . . in\nthe neighborhood.‖\n\n                c. The investigation\n       Three days after the shooting, Lamb and Rump were taken into custody\nafter leading police on a high-speed chase in a stolen car and fleeing into an\nAnaheim apartment complex. Just before his arrest, Lamb fired a shot at officers\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\ffrom a second-story balcony, then discarded his weapon by tossing it over the\nrailing into a raised planter. A firearms expert concluded that the cartridge found\nat the scene of Miller‘s death had been fired from the gun Lamb fired at officers.\nThe gun had a capacity for 14 bullets in the magazine and one in the chamber.\nLamb and Rump were charged with murdering Miller, and were jointly tried in\n2007.\n        When a detective had tried to interview defendant in October 2002\nregarding Miller‘s death seven months earlier, defendant said he had nothing to\nsay to him. In 2006, however, defendant contacted Lamb‘s investigator about the\ncrime, telling the investigator that he was the person who shot Miller, and agreeing\nto testify at Lamb and Rump‘s trial that they had nothing to do with the shooting.\nAt the time he contacted Lamb‘s investigator, defendant had just begun serving a\nprison sentence of 45 years to life in an unrelated case.\n        Defendant testified on Lamb‘s behalf at both the guilt and penalty phases of\ntrial. According to defendant, the first time he saw Miller after the news segment\nabout PEN1 was at the party in Costa Mesa, but he had been angry with Miller\nabout the interview and other matters for some time. Between 8:00 and 10:00\np.m., he and Miller left the party in Costa Mesa to buy heroin. During the drive,\ndefendant knew Miller would ―cease to exist‖ before the night was over. After\nstopping briefly at a strip mall so that Miller could use the telephone, they\ncontinued driving into Anaheim, ending up in an alley near an apartment complex.\nDefendant parked his truck and they started walking down the alley. At one point,\nMiller and defendant started to turn left into an opening that led to a walkway to\nthe apartments, with Miller walking a couple of paces ahead of defendant.\nMoments later, defendant grabbed a gun from his waistband and ―blasted him.‖\nDefendant ran back to his truck, which was located about 60 feet from Miller‘s\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fbody. He testified that he saw no other cars in the alley as he was leaving, and that\nhe drove off at a normal speed and returned to the party.\n       Defendant also testified regarding the firearm that was used to kill Miller.\nAccording to defendant, he ran into Lamb in a bar the day after the shooting and\ngave him the weapon, which Lamb said he needed to protect himself against\nMexican gang members. Defendant indicated that the weapon had been in his\npossession for about six months. However, during cross-examination he said he\ndid not know the location of the gun‘s safety, and his answer regarding the number\nof bullets the firearm could hold was incorrect.\n       After testifying at the guilt phase of Lamb and Rump‘s trial in 2007, but\nbefore taking the witness stand at Lamb‘s penalty phase trial in 2008, defendant\nwas charged with Miller‘s murder, for which the prosecution was seeking the\ndeath penalty. Despite the court‘s repeated admonitions regarding his right against\nself-incrimination, defendant continued to maintain that he shot Miller. He told\nLamb‘s penalty phase jury that he lives by his own laws and that he would kill\n―anyone like [Miller] that doesn‘t abide by the rules.‖ Defendant testified more\nspecifically that after seeing Miller‘s interview on the news broadcast, he knew\nMiller was a ―dead man‖ because he was giving up secrets ―to the enemy‖ and\ndivulging information that was detrimental to PEN1.\n\n               d. Other evidence at defendant’s 2009 trial\n       The prosecutor, joined by the lead detective in the Miller shooting, read\naloud to the jury a redacted version of the transcript of defendant‘s prior\ntestimony. The prosecution also called several gang expert witnesses who testified\nregarding defendant‘s past and present gang affiliations, and the history, culture,\nand activities of White supremacist gangs generally and PEN1 in particular.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f       Eric Kraus, an Orange County parole officer who specializes in supervising\nWhite supremacist parolees, was defendant‘s parole officer for about three years,\nbeginning in early 2001. During that time, defendant was a documented associate\nof the Nazi Low Riders.\n       In May 2001, Kraus arrested defendant for a parole violation and he was\nreturned to custody. About one week later, Kraus and Costa Mesa police\nLieutenant Clay Epperson visited defendant in prison at defendant‘s request.\nDefendant informed Kraus that another prisoner had cut him with a razor on the\nback of the neck while they were in the exercise yard. Defendant explained that\nhe had been assaulted for previously refusing to follow a ―green light order‖ to kill\nhis friend and prison cellmate Joseph Govey, but that the recent assault meant he\nwould receive no further discipline for his disobedience. According to Kraus,\nsuch an order would have come from a ―shot caller‖ in either the Aryan\nBrotherhood or the Nazi Low Riders prison gang.\n       During Kraus‘s prison visit, defendant indicated to him that his current\ngang status was with PEN1, ―if anything.‖ Kraus believed that defendant‘s self-\nreport was confirmed by correspondence intercepted by prison officials, in which\ndefendant identified himself as a member of PEN1.\n       Like Kraus, Lieutenant Epperson expressed the view that defendant was a\nmember of PEN1 at the time of Miller‘s death. In forming that opinion, Epperson\npointed to defendant‘s statements during their May 2001 prison visit, his\ntestimony at the Lamb and Rump trial, his prior conviction for dissuading a\nwitness for the benefit of a criminal street gang, recorded telephone calls in which\ndefendant issued orders on behalf of PEN1, and his many PEN1 and White\nsupremacist-themed tattoos.\n       Epperson also provided extensive testimony regarding the history,\nstructure, and culture of White supremacist gangs. He indicated that despite the\n\n                                          8\n\ffact they sport tattoos of Nazi symbols to represent themselves, and are bound\ntogether by racial animus, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hatred, White\nsupremacists are not ideologically driven. They tend to prey on their own\ncommunity with crimes that benefit themselves and the gang, rather than commit\nhate crimes. The gangs are structured hierarchically, and status within the gang is\nearned by the amount of crime and violence the member has carried out to benefit\nthe gang. Criminal successes are therefore boasted about and known to other gang\nmembers. Respect is an important theme in White supremacist gang culture, and\ndisrespect from gang members and nonmembers alike is met with violence. An\nact that is viewed as disrespectful of the gang leadership would require even\ngreater sanctions, including being marked for death. The ―payback‖ for\ndisrespecting gang leaders can occur immediately or days, months, even years,\nlater.\n         Focusing more specifically on PEN1, Epperson described the gang‘s\nhistory and activities. Formed in 1986 by followers of a punk rock band, PEN1\nsoon transitioned into a street and prison gang and grew rapidly to fill a power\nvacuum when the prominence of the Nazi Low Riders began to decline.\nAccording to Epperson, PEN1‘s ―stock in trade‖ is ―self-serving thuggery and\nviolence‖ and the gang often targets law enforcement, prison officials, and\nprosecutors. The gang‘s moneymaking activities include identity theft and drug\ntrafficking, which it carries out with the help of female associates.\n\n             2. Defense evidence\n         The defense called no witnesses or otherwise presented any evidence at the\nguilt phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f       B. Penalty Phase Evidence\n\n           1. Prosecution evidence\n       The prosecution‘s case in aggravation included evidence regarding\ndefendant‘s violent criminal activity both in and out of custody, defendant‘s prior\ncriminal convictions and prison rules violations, recordings of defendant‘s\ntelephone conversations with PEN1 gang members and associates while he was in\ncustody in the Orange County jail, and victim impact testimony.\n\n               a. Violent criminal activity and prior convictions\n\n                     i. Robberies of Virgil Troutman and Catherine Brandolino\n       Four witnesses testified regarding defendant‘s involvement in the April\n1985 residential robbery of Virgil Troutman. According to Troutman, defendant\nand two other men burst into his Costa Mesa home demanding money and drugs\nand assaulting him and his friend. Troutman recognized the three intruders\nbecause they all had grown up together. After being punched in the eye by one of\ndefendant‘s confederates, Troutman and his friend were directed to empty their\npockets. Defendant and the two other robbers took various valuables, including a\ndiamond ring, then left the scene, threatening to kill Troutman and his friend if\nthey called the police. Defendant‘s parole officer testified that defendant\ntelephoned him two days after the robbery, admitting that he had hit Troutman\nduring the incident. On the parole officer‘s advice, defendant turned himself in to\npolice. According to the arresting officer, defendant indicated that he was angry\nwith Troutman for selling cocaine to a young boy. Although Troutman testified\nthat he had previously used cocaine, he denied ever having sold cocaine to anyone,\nincluding a child.\n       In connection with this incident, the prosecution presented evidence that\ndefendant pleaded guilty to grand theft from a person. The prosecution also\npresented evidence showing that, about two years earlier, a jury found defendant\n\n                                         10\n\fguilty of second degree burglary for breaking into and entering a Santa Ana\nresidence with an intent to steal.\n          Three other witnesses testified regarding defendant‘s involvement in a\nrobbery that occurred in April 1989, two years after the Troutman robbery.\nCatherine Schreiner, formerly Catherine Brandolino, told the jury that the incident\noccurred early in the morning as she and a girlfriend were returning to their car in\nthe parking lot of a Denny‘s restaurant. A man approached her girlfriend, then\nher, asking what time it was. After a pickup truck arrived and stopped about 10\nfeet away with its motor idling and passenger door open, the man suddenly\ngrabbed Brandolino‘s purse off her shoulder, jumped into the truck, and shut the\ndoor. Brandolino and her friend yelled at the men and held on to the truck, trying\nto open the door, but they jumped back when the truck took off. Brandolino‘s\nfriend, Linda Nguyen, gave a similar account of the incident.\n          Officer Michael Cacho of the Costa Mesa Police Department testified\nregarding the events that followed the 911 call reporting the purse-snatching\nincident. According to Officer Cacho, Brandolino and Nguyen provided him with\ndescriptions of the robbers, and the license plate number and description of the\ntruck, which was then broadcast to other officers. One of the officers who heard\nthe broadcast located the truck, stopped the vehicle, and detained defendant, who\nwas driving, and his passenger. Brandolino and Nguyen both identified the truck.\nAt an in-field lineup, Nguyen indicated that she had not seen the driver‘s face but\nbelieved the checkered shirt defendant was wearing matched the shirt worn by the\ndriver.\n          The prosecution presented evidence that in connection with this incident\ndefendant pleaded guilty to second degree robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                   ii. The 1991 killing of Folsom State Prison inmate Clyde\n                        Nordeen\n       The prosecution presented extensive evidence regarding defendant‘s\ninvolvement in the April 1991 killing of 56-year-old Clyde Nordeen, who was\nserving a sentence in Folsom State Prison for child molestation. Correctional\nOfficer Marshall Stewart testified that on the day of the incident, he was on duty\nsupervising defendant and about 25 to 30 other inmates who were assigned to a\nwood-cutting job in a Folsom prison work area known as China Hill. As Officer\nStewart explained, inmates assigned to China Hill are dressed in long-sleeved blue\nshirts, usually with a white T-shirt underneath, and they are permitted to use tools\nsuch as pickaxes and shovels. Officer Stewart testified that while conducting a\nperimeter security check around 11:30 a.m. on the day in question, he noticed\nblood along the back side of China Hill‘s fence line. Following the trail of blood\nhe discovered Nordeen‘s badly beaten body in the back corner of a storage shed.\nForensic Pathologist Gregory Reiber testified that Nordeen had suffered severe\nbrain injury and extensive blunt force trauma to his head and face, including\nnumerous lacerations and multiple fractures on his skull and eye sockets. He\nfound no defensive wounds on Nordeen‘s extremities and believed that his death\nwas not instantaneous.\n       Other witnesses testified regarding the investigation into Nordeen‘s killing.\nFor example, a correctional officer documenting the scene at China Hill told the\njury that a short distance from Nordeen‘s body he found a concrete-filled metal\npipe and a wooden pickax handle, both of which had blood on them. He also\ndiscovered other evidence nearby that appeared to be related to the crime,\nincluding another wooden pickax handle and a wooden handle possibly from a\nshovel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f       Evidence of defendant‘s involvement in Nordeen‘s death was presented\nlargely through the testimony of Sergeant Steven Vance, who led the prison‘s\ninvestigation into the incident. Vance related to the jury the information given to\nhim by Ronald Rostamo, one of the inmates assigned to the wood-cutting job on\nChina Hill on the day in question. According to Vance, Rostamo told him that\naround 11:00 a.m., he overheard inmate John Alder say to defendant, ―He‘s not\ndead yet.‖ He then saw Alder pick up a wooden pickax handle and heard him tell\ndefendant there was another one on the ground ―that would work.‖ Rostamo\nwatched as defendant and Alder walked down a pathway toward the rear of the\nstorage shed and disappeared from his view as they passed a small trailer.\nAccording to Rostamo, defendant and Alder reappeared two to three minutes later\nwalking together back along the path and checking each other for bloodstains.\nRostamo further reported that when defendant and Alder returned to the worksite,\ndefendant said to Rostamo, ―Give me your T-shirt, mine has blood on it.‖ Fearful\nof defendant, Rostamo went to the shed with defendant where defendant put on\nRostamo‘s white T-shirt and returned to his work at the wood pile. Rostamo told\nVance finally that defendant and Alder hid their T-shirts underneath a small trailer\nnear the shed. An investigator dispatched to that location found the hidden shirts.\nRostamo‘s account of the T-shirt exchange was further supported by the testimony\nof the correctional officer who conducted body searches of the inmates who\nreturned from China Hill that day. He observed during his search that defendant\nand two other inmates were not wearing their long-sleeved blue shirts.\n       Nordeen‘s killing was referred to the Sacramento County District Attorney\nbut no charges were filed. Prison authorities, however, found defendant guilty of a\nprison rules violation and transferred him to the administrative segregation unit for\n26 months.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                    iii. Recklessly evading a peace officer in 1994\n       Tom Dare, an officer with the Garden Grove Police Department, testified\nregarding an incident in October 1994 involving a driver who led him on a high-\nspeed pursuit in a residential area and eluded arrest by escaping into the backyard\nof a neighborhood home. Officer Dare related that he was patrolling an area\nwhere a number of residential burglaries had recently occurred when he observed\na driver make a quick and erratic turn into a driveway but then remain in the car.\nA check of the vehicle‘s license plate showed the car had recently been\nimpounded and released. As the officer made a U-turn to investigate further, the\ncar exited the driveway and Dare followed. When the car ran a stop sign and Dare\nactivated his overhead lights to conduct a traffic stop, the car accelerated to\nupward of 70 miles per hour, running stop signs and skidding erratically near\nchildren playing in a front yard. The driver then pulled into a driveway, slammed\non the brakes, fled the car, and jumped into the backyard. Officers searched some\nof the backyards in the vicinity but eventually called off the search because the\nresidents in the area tended to be uncooperative with law enforcement and it\nappeared the driver had escaped into one of the homes. When Dare searched the\nabandoned vehicle, he found on the front seat defendant‘s driver‘s license and a\nletter addressed to defendant from the Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation. Dare believed the driver was the same person depicted in the\nphotograph on defendant‘s driver‘s license.\n\n                    iv. The 2004 murder of Cory Lamons\n       During the guilt phase of trial, the jury learned that at the time defendant\ntestified at Lamb and Rump‘s 2007 trial claiming that he was the one who killed\nScott Miller, he recently had begun serving a sentence of 45 years to life. During\nthe penalty phase, the jury was told that that prison term was a third-strike\nsentence imposed after defendant pleaded guilty to second degree murder for the\n\n\n                                          14\n\fApril 2004 killing of Cory Lamons and that, in a bifurcated proceeding following\nits guilt phase verdicts, the court found true a third special circumstance allegation,\nthat defendant was convicted previously of murder, within the meaning of section\n190.2, subdivision (a)(2). The prosecution also presented to the jury the following\nevidence regarding the details of the Lamons murder.\n       Sara Lenard rented a room in the two-story Huntington Beach apartment\nwhere the murder occurred. She testified that around 4:00 p.m. on the day\nLamons was killed, she walked downstairs from her second-floor bedroom to find\nfour people on the first level of the apartment whom she had never seen before.\nDefendant was holding a hammer in his hand and standing with his back against\nthe wall near the door leading to an attached garage. When Lenard asked what\nwas going on, the woman in the group, later identified as defendant‘s girlfriend\nSuzanne Miller, replied, ―This isn‘t going to be good.‖ When Lamons then\nwalked into the apartment through the door leading from the garage, Lenard saw\ndefendant strike Lamons with the hammer. According to Lenard, as defendant\nrepeatedly hit Lamons in the head with the hammer, Lamons was screaming, ―I\ndidn‘t do anything, I didn‘t do anything.‖ Terrified, Lenard ran out the front door.\nShe returned a couple of minutes later after the screaming had stopped. When she\ncame back inside, she saw a lot of blood and Lamons lying motionless on the\nfloor. Lenard left the apartment again, this time with her boyfriend, who had been\nin the bedroom upstairs during the incident. The couple returned to the apartment\nseveral hours later to retrieve their possessions. When they entered, defendant and\nSuzanne Miller were gone and the blood had been cleaned up, but there were two\nmen Lenard did not recognize, who warned her and her boyfriend to ―[k]eep your\nmouth shut or something like this will happen to you.‖\n       Detective Steven Mack testified regarding the circumstances surrounding\nthe discovery of Lamons‘s body and defendant‘s arrest two days after the killing.\n\n                                          15\n\fMack told the jury he was conducting surveillance on a white Ford pickup truck\nbased on information he had received that a group of individuals was trying to\ndispose of a body. At the time the truck was eventually pulled over in Riverside,\ndefendant was at the wheel and Suzanne Miller was in the passenger seat. In the\nbed of the truck was a wood pile covered with carpeting. When Mack detected the\nodor of decomposing flesh and investigated further, he discovered Lamons‘s body\nunderneath the wood. It had been wrapped in dark material that was held together\nwith strips of bedsheet.\n       Detective Mack testified further regarding the condition of Lamons‘s body\nat the time it was discovered in the back of the truck. According to Mack,\nLamons‘s left eye and lips were swollen, and he had visible bruising on the\nforehead, knuckles and upper legs. The parties stipulated that the Orange County\nCoroner‘s Division could not determine the precise cause of death due to the high\nlevel of drugs in Lamons‘s body. The cause of death was therefore listed as ―blunt\nforce head injuries with methamphetamine and amphetamine intoxication.‖\n       Mack also described the evidence obtained during a search of the\nHuntington Beach apartment where Lamons was killed. He told the jury that\nofficers found bleach stains on the carpet leading to the door to the garage, and a\nclaw hammer, the striking portion of which was consistent with the bruise marks\non Lamons‘s body. In the garage, officers found the remnants of a bedsheet that\nmatched the material used to tie the material covering Lamons‘s body.\n       Lamons‘s mother testified briefly, telling the jury that she misses her son\nevery day, and that the worst part for her is knowing that he died a violent death\nbut she was not there to protect him.\n       The prosecutor and the lead detective in the Miller killing then read aloud\nto the jury the transcript of defendant‘s testimony at the Lamb and Rump trial in\nwhich he discussed the Lamons murder. That portion of the prior testimony had\n\n                                         16\n\fbeen redacted during its presentation in the guilt phase of defendant‘s trial for the\nMiller killing. The jury thus heard defendant admit that he beat Lamons to death\nwith his hands and a hammer and then wrapped up his body. When asked why he\nkilled Lamons, defendant replied that Lamons ―had it coming.‖ Specifically,\ndefendant said it was ―gang-type stuff,‖ that Lamons was ―ripping off girls,‖ and\n―being a dope fiend . . . stealing things, taking things, whatever.‖\n\n                    v. Violent conduct while in custody\n       The prosecution presented evidence of numerous incidents involving\ndefendant‘s use of force and violence while in custody.\n       Correctional Officer Mireles testified that in June 1991, she saw defendant\nattack his cellmate at Folsom State Prison. Defendant stood over the inmate\npunching him with closed fists until Mireles could separate them by removing the\ninmate from the cell and closing the door.\n       Correctional Officer Gomez testified that about one year later, in May\n1992, he heard defendant shouting from his cell in the security housing unit at\nCalifornia Corcoran State Prison (Corcoran). When Gomez went to investigate,\nhe observed defendant‘s cellmate seated on his own bunk, with bloodstains on his\nshirt. Defendant admitted hitting his cellmate, claiming that he did so after his\ncellmate said he would ―beat my ass‖ and ―took a swing at me.‖\n       A different officer testified about another incident at Corcoran several\nmonths later in July 1992. Correctional Officer Schuman was in a tower with a\nview of the exercise yard when he observed defendant attack another inmate by\nhitting him on the head and shoulders with clenched fists. The inmate fell\nbackward but defendant continued to hit him in the head, ignoring Schuman‘s\norder to stop fighting. Defendant eventually complied with the order and lay\nprone on the ground after Schuman fired a round from a .37-millimeter gas gun in\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fhis direction. But when defendant and the other inmate resumed fighting,\nSchuman had to discharge the gas gun a second time to bring the situation under\ncontrol.\n       Defendant had been released from custody at one point but was returned to\nprison for a parole violation in early 1995. Correctional Officer Wren testified\nthat in May 1995, he responded to a ―man down‖ report in a housing area for gang\nmembers in the California Institute for Men, Chino (Chino). Wren told the jury\nthat he observed defendant‘s cellmate lying on the cell floor bleeding profusely\nfrom deep cuts in his right shoulder, hand, forearm, chest and thigh. After\nremoving the injured cellmate for medical treatment, Wren returned to the cell and\nobserved that defendant had a laceration on his right hand. According to the\nofficer, such injuries were consistent with the use of a razor blade. The\nprosecution presented evidence that defendant pleaded guilty to assault by a state\nprisoner and received a second-strike sentence of four years to run consecutively\nto his then-current sentence.\n       Correctional Officer Hinojos testified that four months later, in September\n1995, he responded to defendant‘s cell at Chino after another ―man down‖ report.\nAccording to Officer Hinojos, he observed that defendant‘s cellmate had a head\ninjury and defendant had minor abrasions and bleeding on several fingers.\n       In May 1996 defendant was back at Corcoran in the administrative\nsegregation unit. Correctional Officer Smith testified that when he searched the\ncell occupied by defendant and his cellmate, he found on the cellmate‘s side of the\nroom two pieces of weapon-grade metal and, on defendant‘s side, a handmade\nhandcuff key.\n       Correctional Officer Priest testified about an incident at the same prison six\nmonths later, in November 1996. Officer Priest told the jury that he heard a\ncommotion coming from the cell defendant shared with another inmate and\n\n                                         18\n\fobserved defendant standing over his cellmate punching and kicking him in the\nhead and upper torso while the cellmate was on the floor in a fetal position trying\nto protect himself. Priest ordered defendant to stop and exit the cell, but defendant\ncontinued punching and kicking his cellmate until Priest fired a nonlethal rubber\nbaton round at him.\n       Culinary Officer Nava described for the jury defendant‘s conduct during\nthe Chino staff‘s investigation into a homicide that had occurred at that facility in\nJune 2003. As part of the investigation, inmates were being transported from their\ncells to the prison kitchen to be interviewed. Nava told the jury that he observed\ndefendant shout out an order to fellow White inmates not to go to the kitchen for\ninterviews.3 Nava alerted staff to defendant‘s announcement and accompanied\nanother officer to defendant‘s cell to investigate. Defendant told them that no\nWhite inmates would be going to the kitchen. Afterward, no White inmate gave\nan interview.\n\n                    vi. Orchestrating crimes while in custody\n       The prosecution played a number of tape recordings and presented\ntranscripts of defendant‘s monitored telephone calls while in custody in the\nOrange County jail from 2007 until a few weeks before trial in his case in 2009.\nThe recordings were played at various points during testimony by Sheriff‘s\nDeputy Seth Tunstall, who had monitored and recorded the conversations.\n\n\n3      According to Nava, defendant yelled, ―Radio, radio, all wood pile, all wood\npile and comrades. The sergeants are conducting — are taking interviews in the\nkitchen so you will not, I repeat, you will not go into the kitchen. And I mean no\none. And I mean no one. Thank you,‖ to which other inmates responded, ―Thank\nyou.‖ Nava explained to the jury that ―wood pile‖ is a reference to White inmates\nand ―comrades‖ refers to those who are active members of defendant‘s ―set\ngroup.‖\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fTunstall identified for the jury the participants in the telephone calls and their\nrelationship to the PEN1 gang, and he described the individuals and organizations\nreferenced in the calls.\n       In some of the calls, defendant seemed to be coordinating in-custody\nassaults on members of a rival White supremacist gang called the United Society\nof Aryan Skinheads (USAS). For example, in April 2007 defendant spoke with\nRebecca Mangan, who was Lamb‘s girlfriend at the time and an important conduit\nfor defendant‘s communications outside the jail. In that call, Mangan told\ndefendant that a PEN1 gang member named ―Stomper‖ had been stabbed by\nsomeone from USAS while in state prison. Defendant told Mangan that if she\ntalked with PEN1 member ―Half P‖ she should tell him what had happened to\nStomper. He also directed Mangan to ―[t]ell him I said go get one now.‖\nDefendant‘s remarks during the recorded conversation indicated that Half P was in\ncustody in the same prison where defendant had been housed before his transfer to\ncounty jail, and that there were ―four of them,‖ meaning four USAS members that\nhe and Half P had been ―checking on.‖\n       About one year later, in a March 2008 conversation with his friend Andrea\nMetzger, defendant asked her whether she had sent a letter regarding USAS to\nanother PEN1 state prison inmate, ―Patrick,‖ and instructed her to tell him ―to be\non the lookout for them‖ because they have ―jumped . . . three homies in the last\nyear.‖ Defendant told her to have Patrick tell ―anybody and everybody that has\nanything to do with . . . our people . . . .‖ Defendant added, ―Fuck them dudes, . . .\nsmash them all until they fucking go blind.‖ Defendant then told Metzger he\nneeded ―it to go . . . [e]verywhere, all worldwide . . . [that] if you run into one of\nthem fuckers, just smash them, period, no if, ands, or buts about it.‖\n       Other telephone calls suggested that defendant was setting up crimes to be\ncommitted outside prison facilities. For example, in a series of conversations in\n\n                                           20\n\flate May and early June 2007, defendant spoke with PEN1 gang members Jason\nCary and Jason Jones and to Jill Walker, another woman who helped facilitate his\ncommunications outside the jail, regarding what appeared to be a plan for a home\ninvasion robbery. Defendant told Walker to ―grab his scooter‖ and ―anything else\nthat ain‘t nailed down,‖ and to ―take him down‖ and ―divvy it up when they‘re\ndone.‖ When Walker informed defendant that ―the Mexican dudes were gonna\ntake care of it,‖ defendant asked, ―You didn‘t tell ‘em where it was at or anything\ndid ya?‖ She assured him she had not. Defendant then instructed Walker to ―call\nthe homeboy back right now‖ so defendant could ―set up the fucking guidelines.‖\nHe also directed Cary to get in touch with ―the homeboy‖ on a ―secure line,‖\ntelling him that he ―want[ed] to make this thing happen.‖ In a conversation with\nJones, defendant instructed him that ―everything goes,‖ including a $30,000\n―scooter.‖ In a third and final conversation about the apparent plan, defendant told\nCary that defendant‘s brother wants him ―there‖ on Monday. He also expressed\nfrustration, saying he did not ―know why . . . this is so difficult for everybody to\nunderstand.‖ When Cary said it was ―just a matter of getting together,‖ defendant\nprovided him with the names of others who ―should be ready.‖ Defendant then\ncommented that ―evidently somebody needed to hear my voice to . . . tell ‘em . . .\n[to] put the pieces of the puzzle together and fucking make it happen.‖\n       In one of the recorded conversations described above, defendant indicated\nthat he already had a cash buyer for the ―scooter‖ and agreed with Walker that he\nwould split the proceeds from the sale with her. The prosecution also played for\nthe jury a monitored call between defendant and his two brothers in which\ndefendant apparently again sought to profit by putting PEN1 gang members ―to\nwork.‖ In that July 2007 conversation, defendant said he needed to find ―some\njobs.‖ He also said that ―the dudes will go do it . . . [and] . . . [t]hey tell me they‘ll\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fgive me a third, right off the top.‖ Defendant also said he planned to ―throw [the\nmoney] into mom‘s bank account‖ so that he could access it.\n       To bolster the monitored calls evidence, the prosecutor read into the record\nthe portions of defendant‘s testimony at Lamb and Rump‘s earlier trial in which he\nindicated that he still had contact with others outside of jail and that Mangan set\nup his communications with other people. Defendant also admitted in his prior\ntestimony that he ―possibly‖ attempted to set up home invasion robberies while in\njail and ―probably‖ ordered ―a hit‖ on people. The subject of ordering hits arose\nagain, during defendant‘s testimony on his own behalf in the defense case in\nmitigation, when the prosecutor elicited from defendant that he had ―probably‖\ntried more than five times in the past week to arrange for assaults on USAS\nmembers. As defendant explained, he was ―on a mission.‖\n\n                b. Victim impact testimony\n       As evidence in aggravation relating to the circumstances of the capital\ncrime (§ 190.3, factor (a)), the prosecutor called Scott Miller‘s mother, Bonnie\nMiller, to testify about the impact her son‘s death had on her and other family\nmembers. According to Ms. Miller, after the murder, Miller‘s father suffered a\nfatal stroke, his older brother Calvin had to be hospitalized after a breakdown, and\nhis elderly grandmother, with whom Miller was very close, nearly died from a\nheart condition. Ms. Miller testified further that she has fulltime custody of\nMiller‘s son, ―Little Scott,‖ who was born shortly after Miller‘s death. According\nto Ms. Miller, Little Scott does not comprehend why he does not have a father like\nhis friends do, and it broke her heart to tell him he would never see his father. She\ntold the jury it also breaks her heart to take Little Scott to the beach to watch the\nsurfers because she realizes that Miller, who was an avid surfer, will never have a\nchance to teach his son to surf. Ms. Miller concluded her testimony by explaining\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fthat part of her died when her son was murdered and, except for her love for Little\nScott, she has since shut herself off from the rest of the world.\n\n           2. Defense evidence\n       The defense presented a multifaceted case in mitigation that included\ncharacter witnesses, expert testimony regarding defendant‘s social history and\npsychological profile, and testimony by the former warden of San Quentin State\nPrison, who contrasted the day-to-day existence of a death row inmate with that of\nan inmate at a high security prison. Defendant also testified on his own behalf.\n\n               a. Character evidence\n       Two witnesses who had testified during the prosecution‘s case-in-chief at\nthe guilt phase of trial described for the jury a different side of defendant. Shirley\nWilliams testified that she was good friends with defendant and his entire family,\nand that if she was in trouble in any way, defendant was there to help. According\nto Williams, defendant was always courteous to her and respectful and protective\nof women generally. She considered defendant a good father who loved his\nchildren, and she never saw him get violent or enraged; she experienced his\ngentler side only.\n       Another prosecution witness at the guilt phase, Donald McLachlan, told the\njury he considers defendant ―a friend in every definition of the word.‖ He\nexplained that if someone was having problems with a girlfriend or wife, or\nneeded money, defendant would be there. McLachlan also recounted that on one\noccasion, defendant intervened to protect McLachlan‘s possessions when people\nstarted taking things from his residence after he had been taken into custody.\n       Suzanne Miller‘s testimony at the penalty phase reiterated the theme that\nthere were two sides to defendant. Miller, who was defendant‘s girlfriend,\nacknowledged that defendant was capable of great violence. But she described\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fdefendant as loving and respectful, and believed his life had value. Miller also\ncharacterized defendant as very protective, explaining to the jury that defendant\nagreed to a sentence of 45 years to life for Lamons‘s murder so that she and the\nother codefendants in the case could receive determinate sentences rather than life\nterms.\n         Joseph Govey testified about defendant‘s loyalty as a friend. He told the\njury that when he and defendant were cellmates 20 years earlier, defendant\nshowed Govey a letter indicating that an Aryan Brotherhood shot-caller had\nordered defendant to kill him but defendant refused to do so.\n\n                 b. Social history and psychological assessment\n         The defense presented extensive expert testimony by Roberto Flores de\nApodaca, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist. In forming his opinions, Dr. Flores\nconducted two interviews of defendant, administered psychological tests, and\nreviewed various records provided by the defense team.\n         Dr. Flores began his testimony by describing defendant‘s family\nbackground and social development, much of which was reported to him by\ndefendant himself. Defendant‘s parents separated when he was 10 years old and\nhe had had virtually no contact with his father since that time. His father‘s\ndeparture from the family was the point at which defendant started having\nbehavioral problems in school and running afoul of the law. Defendant told\nDr. Flores that he was grateful to his mother for working hard and providing for\nhim and his four older brothers. But Dr. Flores was of the view that defendant‘s\nmother was overwhelmed and unable to adequately exercise any authority over\ndefendant. Defendant reported positive relationships with his four siblings, with\nwhom he spent the bulk of his time. Dr. Flores believed that defendant‘s older\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fbrothers provided him with some parent-like care and guidance, but ultimately\nwere not successful authority figures for him.\n       Notwithstanding defendant‘s description of an ―idyllic‖ childhood and\nadolescence with his siblings, his criminal activities and substance abuse began at\nan early age. Starting with alcohol use at age 10, defendant had moved on to\nmarijuana, LSD, and cocaine by the time he was 14 or 15 years old. By age 25,\nmethamphetamine was defendant‘s ―drug of choice.‖ According to Dr. Flores,\ndefendant‘s alcohol and drug abuse were both a cause and effect of his bad\ndecisions that tended toward criminality, choices he was making on his own\nbecause he had no real authority figure in his life. For example, at age 10,\ndefendant was arrested for receiving stolen property, specifically, some diamond\nearrings that he had sold to buy alcohol. Dr. Flores pointed out that defendant,\nwho was 46 years old at the time of trial, had spent about 25 years of his adult life\nin prison, and he agreed with defense counsel that the prison environment\nprovided defendant with structure and effectual authority figures.\n       Dr. Flores shared with the jury defendant‘s positive comments regarding\nhis two former wives and his two children, 25-year-old Justin and eight-year-old\nRyder. Defendant identified his drug use and lengthy incarcerations as the reasons\nfor the marriage breakups, and he told Dr. Flores that he remained committed to\nhis former wives and his children. Dr. Flores gleaned from these and other\ncomments that although defendant can be violent and vengeful when, in his\njudgment, the situation called for it, he also can be loyal, committed, and helpful\nin other circumstances. In defendant‘s own words, ―The two things that cannot be\nforgiven are [child molesters] and rats, everything else can be forgiven in life.‖\n       Dr. Flores also discussed the results of the intelligence and psychological\ntests he administered to defendant. He determined that defendant‘s intelligence\nquotient on a nonverbal intelligence test was 92, below the average score of 100 in\n\n                                         25\n\fthe general population, but possibly attributable to his having given up on school\nat such an early age. Defendant‘s responses on the personality assessment\ninventory showed that he was prone to drug abuse, aggression, and violence, and\nthat he had no regard for the rights of others, social norms, or the law. That\nassessment further indicated that, with regard to defendant‘s propensity for\naggression, he was irritable and short-tempered, and that he sometimes was unable\nto control his anger. In Dr. Flores‘s view, defendant‘s drug abuse was both the\ncause and effect of this impulsivity. Finally, Dr. Flores described the results of the\nHare psychopathy checklist, a test that quantifies the subject‘s psychopathological\ntendencies associated with a ―basic criminality makeup,‖ which the tester then\ncompares to the scores of inmates in the prison population generally. The\nchecklist showed, among other traits, that defendant was cunning, manipulative,\ncallous, and impulsive, and that he lacked guilt or remorse. Defendant‘s score, 34\nout of 40, placed him in the 97th percentile of the prison population generally. In\nconnection with this assessment, Dr. Flores referred to defendant as a ―principle\npsychopath,‖ meaning that his antisocial, criminal, and violent actions and\nbehaviors are governed by his own internal ethical code, which derives from\nprinciples and values of his gang.\n       Regarding a diagnosis, Dr. Flores concluded that defendant met the criteria\nfor antisocial personality disorder and that he was not amenable to treatment.\n       Defendant informed Dr. Flores during the interviews that he wanted to\nreceive the death penalty. In Dr. Flores‘s view, defendant‘s stated reasons for\npreferring a death verdict — a more desirable quality of life on death row — was\nrational and not impulsive. Dr. Flores also believed that the other option for\ndefendant, which likely would be spending the rest of his life in the security\nhousing unit (SHU) at Pelican Bay State Prison, would not be compatible with his\nmental makeup.\n\n                                         26\n\f               c. Differences between life in a security housing unit and life on\n                   death row\n       Daniel Vasquez, the former warden at San Quentin State Prison, testified\nregarding the differences between the day-to-day life of an inmate placed in the\nSHU at Pelican Bay State Prison and that of a death row inmate at San Quentin.\nAs Vasquez explained, the SHU at Pelican Bay is one of the most secure\ncorrectional facilities in the country, and prisoners who are documented street or\nprison gang members are sometimes placed there indefinitely. Inmates assigned to\nthe SHU are locked in their cells almost 24 hours per day. They are allowed three\ncubic feet of property, including a television or radio. Although inmates in the\nSHU are allowed to exercise by themselves in a small indoor yard and to shower\nabout three times a week, they have no outside visibility or fresh air and are not\npermitted face-to-face contact with visitors or other inmates.\n       Vasquez then described life on death row. According to Vasquez,\ncondemned prisoners in death row‘s most desirable area, called the North Seg, can\nexercise right outside their cell door, and have more time out of their cells than\ninmates in the SHU. Good behavior is a requirement for assignment to North Seg\nand there is a long waiting list. Another area within death row, called East Block,\nis less attractive because the day-to-day existence is mostly repetitive and\nmovement outside the cell is more restrictive. For example, inmates are searched\nand handcuffed when they are escorted to the outdoor exercise yard, which is\ndensely populated with other death row inmates and guarded by armed officers.\nDeath row inmates who exhibit bad or dangerous behavior are housed in the\nadjustment center, where the daily routine is similarly repetitive and restrictive.\nAs Vasquez explained, death row inmates are allowed attorney and family visits\nand, with a record of good behavior, may be permitted face-to-face visits. Death\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\frow inmates also are allowed up to six cubic feet of personal property, depending\non their behavior grade.\n       In response to defense counsel‘s hypothetical question, Vasquez expressed\nhis opinion that it was understandable for a convict with a documented history of\nprison gang affiliations to express a preference for living out his days on death row\nrather than in the SHU in Pelican Bay. As Vasquez pointed out, death row\ninmates have more protection from gang members and enemies and less pressure\nto align with gangs.\n       In response to defense counsel‘s line of questioning regarding misconduct\nby prison guards, Vasquez indicated he was aware of an inquiry by the Federal\nBureau of Investigations into allegations that in the late 1980s and early 1990s\nguards at Corcoran staged fights between inmates and bet on them. According to\nVasquez, the investigation resulted in indictments against some staff.\n       During cross-examination by the prosecutor, Vasquez answered questions\nregarding the records that chronicled defendant‘s 20-year history of incarceration\nin the state‘s prison system. He told the jury that the records showed numerous\ninstances in which defendant was briefly released from prison but returned to\ncustody for violating the conditions of his parole. The prosecutor also elicited\nfrom Vasquez information regarding defendant‘s numerous prison rules violations.\nReading from prison records, Vasquez testified, for example, that during\ndefendant‘s first prison commitment, he was written up five times for rules\nviolations.\n\n               d. Defendant’s testimony\n       Defendant testified on his own behalf, telling the jury he would prefer\nbeing on death row at San Quentin than in the SHU at Pelican Bay. He also spoke\nabout his social history, prison experiences, and gang affiliation, and offered his\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\fown perspectives on Miller‘s murder and the evidence regarding his other crimes\nand acts of violence.\n       Defendant first commented on Miller‘s murder. He said that he felt ―bad‖\nfor Miller‘s mother, but that Miller ―messed up on laws written by us‖ and knew\nthe consequences of his actions. When defense counsel asked defendant whether\nhe had tried to assume more culpability for Miller‘s murder by saying he shot him\nwhen he had not, defendant replied, ―Pretty much.‖ Yet defendant still maintained\nthat he was the shooter and that Lamb and Rump had nothing to do with killing\nMiller. During cross-examination, however, the prosecutor asked defendant to\nexplain why he had to tell Lamb‘s girlfriend to remind Lamb, shortly before\ndefendant testified at Lamb and Rump‘s trial in 2007, how defendant had gotten\nthe murder weapon to him. In connection with that line of questioning, the\nprosecutor played for the jury a tape recording of a monitored call from the\nOrange County jail between defendant and Rebecca Mangan in which Mangan\nsaid ―he,‖ meaning Lamb, needed to know how defendant got ―the bullshit to\nhim.‖ Defendant replied, ―Oh, that, that was, at the fucking, uh, uh,\nMargaritaville,‖ a detail that had been ―fucking hatched a long time ago.‖\n       As he had done during his interviews with Dr. Flores, defendant described\nfor the jury his upbringing, family relationships, and history of drug use. He\nrecalled that as a boy he was involved in all types of sports but did not enjoy\nschool because of the ―authority figure‖ aspect of it. He characterized his father as\na strict disciplinarian who would punish him harshly for showing disrespect, but\nspoke about his fondness for his mother and his two former wives, and his love for\nhis own children. Defendant told the jury that he always had maintained good\ncontact with his older son Justin, even during lengthy incarcerations. He\nacknowledged that his prison time and drug use had ruined his marriages, and\nreflected that had he never used drugs he probably would have lived a crime-free\n\n                                         29\n\flife. But defendant also admitted that he ―still love[s] drugs‖ and ―will do drugs‖\nuntil he dies.\n       Defendant testified that he had grown up through the prison system, and he\nbelieved the decades he spent in that environment had produced his violent side.\nAccording to defendant, prison is a ―kill or be killed‖ situation, and ―everybody\ncan get got, no matter how big you are, how small you are, the bodies hit the\nfloor.‖ Defendant indicated that he himself almost had been killed when he was\nstabbed in the neck for disobeying a shot-caller‘s order to kill his cellmate Joseph\nGovey.\n       Defendant also testified regarding his involvement in White supremacist\ngangs. He explained that he did not join a gang during his first incarceration\nbecause at that time he was ―too young, too naïve to see that my race needed\nhelp.‖ He eventually aligned himself with a White supremacist gang because he\nwanted to help the older and younger inmates who were being preyed upon.\nDefendant indicated that he ―lives‖ for his race, but has no problem with other\nraces ―unless they come into my area‖ selling drugs or burglarizing homes. He\ndoes not want ―people harassing my people‖ and would do ―everything feasibly\npossible to make sure that they leave the neighborhood,‖ including killing them,\n―if that‘s what it takes.‖ Defendant emphasized that he had never been convicted\nof a hate crime and had never beat up someone because of his race.\n       Defendant then offered the jury his explanations for some of the crimes and\nacts of violence that were described during the prosecution‘s case in aggravation.\nWith regard to the killing of Folsom prison inmate Clyde Nordeen, defendant\nguessed that the reason no charges were filed against him was because Nordeen\nwas a child molester. Defendant did not like it that Nordeen got ―a little two-year\nsentence‖ for raping children. As for the various assaults on his Folsom prison\ncellmates, defendant explained that the prison had placed known informants in his\n\n                                         30\n\fcell in an attempt to get him to talk about the fatal attack on Nordeen. Defendant\nalso offered his reasons for assaulting fellow inmates in Corcoran. For example,\nhe asserted that a September 1995 attack on an African-American inmate took\nplace in a ―gladiator arena.‖ According to defendant, one of the guards asked if\ndefendant minded him taking home the security camera recording of the exercise-\nyard fight, so that he could show his children the proper way to ―beat somebody‘s\nass.‖ Defendant admitted that in November 1996 he assaulted an inmate who had\ndropped out of one of the gangs. As defendant put it, he ―did what I had to do.‖\n       Defendant did not deny having engaged in numerous crimes and acts of\nviolence both inside and outside the custodial setting, including two homicides\nthat were not part of the prosecution‘s case in aggravation. He pointed out,\nhowever, that he always directed his violence toward drug dealers, addicts,\ngangsters, and convicts, and never against law enforcement. In defendant‘s words,\n―My actions have hurt people. I am sorry about that, but you know, the people\nthat I hurt knew the job was tough when they took it. They signed onto the same\nthing that I signed onto.‖ In this regard, defendant admitted the 1985 burglary of\nVirgil Troutman‘s home, which he described as a drug house. As defendant\nexplained, Troutman was a drug dealer who refused to front defendant some\ndrugs; defendant also had heard Troutman sold drugs to children, which bothered\nhim. Defendant used a similar theme when discussing his involvement in Cory\nLamons‘s murder, explaining that Lamons was a drug addict who owed defendant\nmoney and was stealing from women he knew.\n       Defendant minimized or flatly denied his involvement in other incidents\npresented in the prosecution‘s penalty phase case, however. Specifically,\ndefendant indicated that he did not know that his ―jackass‖ friend was going to\nsteal a woman‘s purse in April 1989, and he claimed he was high on cocaine and\nalcohol when that crime occurred. Defendant also insisted that he had never run\n\n                                        31\n\ffrom the police and was not the person who evaded Garden Grove officers in a\nhigh-speed chase in October 1994. He explained that he co-owned the car, which\nhad been impounded, but maintained that ―Alex‖ had retrieved the car and then\nrun from police because he was carrying a pound of marijuana.\n       Defense counsel‘s direct examination of defendant ended as it had begun,\nby eliciting from defendant that his goal was to get the best situation for himself\nand he therefore preferred to live out the rest of his life on death row.\n                                   II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Guilt Phase Claims\n\n           1. Sufficiency of the evidence of lying in wait\n       The prosecution presented alternative theories of defendant‘s first degree\nmurder liability for Miller‘s death: (1) that the killing was premeditated and\ndeliberated murder, or (2) that it was committed by means of lying in wait.\n(§ 189.) The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. The jury also\nfound true the associated lying-in-wait special-circumstance allegation. (§ 190.2,\nsubd. (a)(15).) Defendant asserts that his murder conviction based on lying in wait\nand the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding were not supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and therefore cannot stand. Under the applicable standard\nfor assessing his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence (People v. Booker\n(2011) 51 Cal.4th 141, 172; People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578; Jackson\nv. Virginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319), we conclude to the contrary that a\nreasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty of first degree murder\non a lying-in-wait theory, and the truth of the lying-in-wait special-circumstance\nallegation, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       The capital murder in this case occurred in 2002, subsequent to a then-\nrecent amendment to the statutory provision setting forth the lying-in-wait special\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\fcircumstance. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(15).) Like the former version, the amended\nlying-in-wait special circumstance requires ― ‗ ―an intentional murder, committed\nunder circumstances which include (1) a concealment of purpose, (2) a substantial\nperiod of watching and waiting for an opportune time to act, and (3) . . . a surprise\nattack on an unsuspecting victim from a position of advantage . . . .‖\n[Citations.]‘ ‖ (People v. Moon (2005) 37 Cal.4th 1, 22; see People v. Poindexter\n(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 572, 584-585 [the definition of lying in wait appearing in\nPeople v. Morales (1989) 48 Cal.3d 527, 557, applies to the postamendment lying-\nin-wait special circumstance]; CALCRIM No. 728.)\n       The prosecutor‘s theory of the case at trial was that defendant was not the\nactual shooter but rather that he aided and abetted the murder by luring Miller out\nof Costa Mesa on the pretext of buying heroin and driving him to the location\nwhere Lamb and Rump were waiting to execute him in a surprise attack. A lying-\nin-wait special circumstance can apply to a defendant who, intending that the\nvictim would be killed, aids and abets an intentional murder committed by means\nof lying in wait. (§ 190.2, subds. (a)(15), (c); People v. Bonilla (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n313, 331-332 [relying on identical language in § 190.2, former subd. (b) as the\nstatutory basis for an aider and abettor‘s liability].) In this factual setting, the\nquestions are whether the defendant, with the intent to kill, aided and abetted the\nvictim‘s killing, and whether the actual killer intentionally killed the victim by\nmeans of lying in wait. (People v. Bonilla, supra, at p. 331.)\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts as we must\n(People v. Johnson, supra, 26 Cal.3d at p. 576), we conclude that all of the\nrequirements for the lying-in-wait special circumstance were established in this\ncase. From defendant‘s statements to fellow gang member McLachlan the day\nafter the shooting, the jury reasonably could infer that defendant harbored an\nintent to kill when he aided and abetted Miller‘s killing. Defendant told\n\n                                           33\n\fMcLachlan that Miller had to be killed because of his news interview and his\nactions ―in the neighborhood.‖ Defendant had elaborated on the first point during\nhis testimony at Lamb and Rump‘s trial, saying that he had been angry at Miller\nfor some time for agreeing to be interviewed for the television news segment and\nthat he would kill anyone like Miller who did not abide by the rules. Defendant\nalso characterized Miller as a ―dead man‖ for giving up the gang‘s secrets ―to the\nenemy.‖\n       The record also contains ample evidence that defendant aided and abetted\nthe killing. ―[A] person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she,\nacting with (1) knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator; and (2) the\nintent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the\noffense, (3) by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages, or instigates, the\ncommission of the crime.‖ (People v. Beeman (1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 561; accord,\nPeople v. Prettyman (1996) 14 Cal.4th 248, 259.)\n       It can be inferred from defendant‘s substantial participation in the events\nleading up to Miller‘s death that he knew of the plan to kill Miller, intended to\nfacilitate that plan, and aided Lamb and Rump in committing the killing.\nDefendant was seen talking and laughing with Miller at the party in Costa Mesa a\nshort time before the shooting. A day after the killing, defendant described for\nMcLachlan his involvement in Miller‘s death. He told McLachlan that he drove\nwith Miller from Costa Mesa to Anaheim with the pretense of obtaining drugs. He\nalso said that he walked next to Miller in the alley right before Miller was killed.\nDefendant told McLachlan that after hearing the sound of footsteps behind them,\nMiller turned to defendant and asked, ―Are those PEN1 guys?‖ and was\n―introduced‖ to Lamb and Rump. Defendant also recounted having yelled at\nLamb for shooting Miller from behind, telling McLachlan he believed Miller\nshould have been shot in the face so that they could have confronted him about\n\n                                         34\n\frunning afoul of the rules. From this evidence, the jury reasonably could infer that\ndefendant aided and abetted Miller‘s killing.\n       The evidence further established that the actual killers intentionally killed\nMiller by means of lying in wait within the meaning of section 190.2,\nsubdivision (a)(15). The record reflects that all of the elements of the special\ncircumstance were satisfied. The autopsy showed that Miller was killed by a\nsingle shot to the back of the head, from which it could be inferred that he was\nkilled intentionally. (See People v. Burney (2009) 47 Cal.4th 203, 243.) The\nevidence also showed that defendant drove with Miller to Anaheim on the pretext\nof buying drugs, leading him to a deserted alleyway where Lamb and Rump were\nwaiting for them. When defendant and Miller got halfway down the alley, Lamb\nand Rump approached them from behind. Moments later, and from that position\nof advantage, Lamb shot Miller in the back of the head.\n       We have characterized similar evidence as a ―classic lying-in-wait special-\ncircumstance murder.‖ (People v. Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 332, fn. 6.) In\nBonilla, the defendant drove the victim, a San Francisco entrepreneur, to a vacant\noffice park at night purportedly to meet with a commercial real estate agent.\nWaiting for them at that location were the defendant‘s two confederates, one of\nwhom was posing as a commercial real estate agent and the other a security guard.\nAs the four men stood together in the parking lot, the confederates suddenly set\nupon the victim and threw him into the back of defendant‘s truck, where they\nwrapped his head in duct tape until he suffocated. (Id. at pp. 321-322.)\n       Defendant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence of intent to kill,\nor the sufficiency of the evidence of watching and waiting for an opportune time\nto act. He argues, however, that there is no substantial evidence of concealment of\npurpose.\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f       With regard to the element of concealment, we have explained that physical\nconcealment before the attack on the victim is not required. Rather, ― ‗[i]t is\nsufficient that a defendant‘s true intent and purpose were concealed by his actions\nor conduct.‘ ‖ (People v. Morales, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 555.) The concealment,\nin that sense, ― ‗is that which puts the defendant in a position of advantage, from\nwhich the factfinder can infer that lying-in-wait was part of the defendant‘s plan to\ntake the victim by surprise.‘ ‖ (Ibid.)\n       Defendant contends that what is lacking in the record is evidence of the\nrequired nexus between concealment of purpose and a surprise attack from a\nposition of advantage. With regard to concealment, defendant argues that\nalthough defendant may have used the promise of a drug purchase to entice Miller\nto leave with him, Miller clearly knew defendant‘s real purpose. According to\ndefendant, Miller was aware of the potential consequences of having been\ninterviewed for the news report on PEN1 and was on his guard. Specifically, in\nthe year following the news report, Miller had told his former girlfriend on several\noccasions that he was concerned for his safety. At the party in Costa Mesa on the\nnight of the shooting, Miller and defendant joked with one another about Miller\nkeeping his guard up. And sometime later that evening, Miller left his former\ngirlfriend a concerned-sounding voicemail message — with defendant‘s voice\npossibly in the background. Furthermore, according to defendant, he had testified\nat Lamb and Rump‘s trial that he told Miller at the party that he was going to kill\nhim. Defendant argues that the only reasonable inferences that could be drawn\nfrom this evidence was that Miller knew his gang wanted him killed and that he\nwas concerned he would be killed that night because he was out with defendant.\nIn defendant‘s view, the evidence did not show concealment of purpose but rather\nthat Miller, a drug addict, made a bad choice to go with defendant to get drugs.\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\f       We reject defendant‘s assertion that the record lacks substantial evidence of\nconcealment of purpose. Defendant‘s summary of the facts ignores the gang\nexpert‘s testimony to the effect that punishment for violating gang rules could be\nextracted years after the offending act, and McLachlan‘s remark that Miller was\n―still running around‖ because no one had the courage to carry out the gang\nleadership‘s order to kill him. This evidence suggested that although Miller may\nhave been aware there would be consequences for participating in the news\ninterview, and may have voiced safety concerns on several occasions during the\nyear following the news broadcast and on the night of the shooting, he did not\nnecessarily expect that the execution would occur when he left the party with\ndefendant to obtain drugs. (See People v. Arellano (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1088,\n1095 [although the recipient of death threats may expect an attack sometime in the\nfuture, he or she has no way of knowing when and where the attack will occur].)\nIndeed, defendant himself acknowledges that the ―ultimate time and place of his\nshooting was most likely unknown to Miller.‖ A reasonable jury could have\ninferred that Miller would not have gone with defendant and placed himself in a\ndeserted alleyway unless be believed the purpose of doing so was to buy drugs.\n       Nor do we agree with defendant that there was no substantial evidence of a\nsurprise attack on Miller from a position of advantage. Defendant emphasizes his\nstatement to McLachlan that when he and Miller walked together in the alley and\nheard the sound of footsteps behind them, Miller asked, ―Are those ―PEN1 guys?‖\nand was ―introduced‖ to Lamb and Rump. Contrary to defendant‘s assertion,\nhowever, Miller‘s awareness of Lamb and Rump‘s presence does not defeat the\ninference that defendant‘s concealment of purpose put his fellow gang members in\na position of advantage by which to take Miller by surprise. (See People v.\nBonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 321-322, 332, fn. 6 [the surprise attack on the\nvictim occurred in a deserted parking lot at night as defendant and his two\n\n                                         37\n\fconfederates spoke with the victim about a contrived commercial real estate\ntransaction]; People v. Webster (1991) 54 Cal.3d 411 [although the victim was\naware of defendant‘s presence, defendant maneuvered himself behind the victim\nand then attacked him without warning from that position of advantage].) That the\nshooting occurred shortly after Miller became aware of Lamb and Rump‘s\npresence may be inferred from Hughes‘s testimony that she heard a gunshot in the\nalley only minutes after Lamb and Rump left her apartment. A surprise attack\nfrom a position of advantage also could be inferred from the evidence that Miller‘s\nbaseball cap and soda can were found underneath his face on the pavement, which\nsuggested he had been caught off guard and dropped these objects at the time he\nwas shot. Defendant argues that the evidence Miller was shot in the back of the\nhead after Lamb and Rump joined up with them showed only that Miller was\nresigned to being killed. Although McLachlan‘s testimony relating defendant‘s\naccount of the killing raised the possibility that Miller was resigned to his fate, the\njury was not obligated to accept defendant‘s assessment of Miller‘s state of mind\nat the time of the shooting. We conclude the record contains sufficient evidence\nfrom which a rational jury could infer a surprise attack from a position of\nadvantage.\n       Defendant‘s challenge to his murder conviction based on lying in wait also\nfails. We have concluded that the lying-in-wait special circumstance under former\nsection 190.2, subdivision (a)(15) is ― ‗ ―slightly different‖ ‘ ‖ from, and its\nelements are ― ‗more stringent‘ ‖ than, lying-in-wait first degree murder under\nsection 189. (People v. Moon, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 22; see People v. Webster,\nsupra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 448 [the lying-in-wait special circumstance requires a\nfinding of intent to kill but lying-in-wait murder requires only a ―wanton and\nreckless intent to inflict injury likely to cause death‖].) As discussed post, in part\nII.A.2., the requirements for the amended version of the lying-in-wait special\n\n                                          38\n\fcircumstance likewise are more demanding than those for lying-in-wait first\ndegree murder. Here, sufficient evidence supports the conclusion that, with the\nintent that Miller would die, defendant aided and abetted an intentional murder\ncommitted by lying in wait. Because sufficient evidence supports the lying-in-\nwait special-circumstance finding, it necessarily supports the first degree murder\nverdict based on the theory of lying in wait. (Cf. People v. Moon, supra, at p. 22.)\n\n           2. Constitutionality of the lying-in-wait special circumstance\n       Defendant argues that the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding must\nbe vacated, and his death sentence reversed, because the special circumstance is\nvirtually identical to, and thus indistinguishable from, the lying-in-wait theory of\nfirst degree murder and, therefore, fails to satisfy the requirements of the Eighth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution.\n       Miller‘s murder occurred in 2002. As defendant correctly points out, in\nMarch 2000, the voters passed Proposition 18, which changed the definition of the\nlying-in-wait special circumstance from a killing while lying in wait to a killing\nby means of lying-in-wait, mirroring the language of the first degree murder\nstatute. (See Stats. 1998, ch. 629, § 2, p. 4163, enacted as Prop. 18, approved by\nvoters, Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) eff. Mar. 8, 2000.) He argues that the\namendment rendered the special circumstance virtually identical to first degree\nlying-in-wait murder and thereby eliminated the guidance needed to prevent its\narbitrary and capricious application in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n       Recent decisions by this court have noted the change to section 190.2,\nsubdivision (a)(15). (See, e.g., People v. Streeter (2012) 54 Cal.4th 205, 246,\nfn. 7; People v. Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 333-334.) Until the present\nmatter, however, we have had no occasion to examine the constitutionality of the\namended special circumstance provision.\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f       In assessing defendant‘s challenge to the amended lying-in-wait special\ncircumstance, we are guided by the following constitutional principles. The\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit a sentence of death ―imposed under\nsentencing procedures that create a substantial risk that the punishment will be\ninflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.‖ (Godfrey v. Georgia (1980) 446\nU.S. 420, 427.) To satisfy this constitutional command, ―the trier of fact must\nconvict the defendant of murder and find one ‗aggravating circumstance‘ (or its\nequivalent) at either the guilt or penalty phase. . . . [T]he aggravating\ncircumstance must meet two requirements. First, the circumstance may not apply\nto every defendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of\ndefendants convicted of murder. [Citation.] Second, the aggravating\ncircumstance may not be unconstitutionally vague.‖ (Tuilaepa v. California\n(1994) 512 U.S. 967, 972.) The lying-in-wait special circumstance is an\n―aggravating circumstance[ ]‖ subject to these constitutional requirements.\n(People v. Bacigalupo (1993) 6 Cal.4th 457, 467-468.)\n       Although this court previously has had no occasion to address the meaning\nand constitutionality of the current version of the lying-in-wait special\ncircumstance, the Fourth District Court of Appeal was called upon to do so in\nPeople v. Superior Court (Bradway) (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 297 (Bradway). The\nCourt of Appeal determined that by passing Proposition 18, which changed the\nspecial circumstance‘s former reference to a killing ― ‗while‘ ‖ lying in wait to a\nkilling ― ‗by means of‘ ‖ lying in wait, the voters intended to conform the temporal\nconnection between the killing and the lying in wait required for the special\ncircumstance to that required for lying-in-wait first degree murder. (Bradway, at\n\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fpp. 307-308.) It also determined that the amended special circumstance was not\nunconstitutionally vague as applied to Bradway. 4 (Bradway, at pp. 309-311.)\n       We agree with Bradway that the voters‘ adoption of the ―by means of‖\nlying-in-wait language mirroring section 189‘s definition of lying-in-wait murder\nevidenced an intention to align the special circumstance with lying-in-wait first\ndegree murder in one of the respects that previously had distinguished the two.\nThat conclusion is further supported by the election materials associated with the\npassage of Proposition 18, as Bradway observed. (Bradway, supra, 105\nCal.App.4th at pp. 307-308.) The voter information pamphlet shows that voters\nwere informed that the courts had interpreted the special circumstance‘s reference\nto a killing ―while‖ lying in wait to require that the murder have ―occurred\nimmediately upon a confrontation between the murderer and the victim.‖\nAccording to the Legislative Analyst, this interpretation precluded application of\nthe special circumstance if the defendant watched and waited for the victim, but\nthe killing occurred after the defendant had captured the victim and transported\nhim or her to another location. (Voter Information Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7,\n2000) Legis. Analyst‘s analysis of Prop. 18, p. 33.) The Legislative Analyst\nexplained that the passage of Proposition 18 would replace the special\ncircumstance‘s previous language with reference to a killing ―by means of‖ lying\n\n\n\n4       Because Bradway was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole,\nrather than death, his constitutional challenge to the lying-in-wait special\ncircumstance arose as a void-for-vagueness claim under the due process clause.\n(Bradway, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 309.) However, his vagueness challenge\nechoed the ―specialized concept of vagueness most clearly defined by the [United\nStates] Supreme Court in dealing with Eighth Amendment challenges to death\npenalties.‖ (Bradway v. Cate (9th Cir. 2009) 588 F.3d 990, 991.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\fin wait, thereby permitting application of the special circumstance in that\npreviously prohibited scenario. (Ibid.; see Bradway, supra, at p. 308.)\n       Having determined that the voters‘ purpose in amending the lying-in-wait\nspecial circumstance was to eliminate the temporal distinction between the special\ncircumstance and lying-in-wait first degree murder, and thereby expand the class\nof cases in which the special circumstance could be found true, the question\nremains whether the special circumstance provision still adequately distinguishes\nitself from other murders and does so in terms that are not so vague as to permit\narbitrary determinations regarding the truth of the special circumstance allegation.\n(Tuilaepa v. California, supra, 512 U.S. at pp. 971-972.) For the reasons\nexplained below, we conclude that the amended lying-in-wait special circumstance\nsatisfies the Eighth Amendment in both respects.\n       People v. Morales, supra, 48 Cal.3d 527, 557, upheld the constitutionality\nof section 190.2, former subdivision (a)(15), concluding that the factual matrix\npresented by an intentional murder that met the elements of concealment,\nwatching and waiting, and a surprise attack from a position of advantage that are\nrequired to establish lying-in-wait first degree murder rendered it ―sufficiently\ndistinct from ‗ordinary‘ premeditated murder to justify treating it as a special\ncircumstance.‖ These characteristics of the former special circumstance provision,\nwhich established that it was neither applicable to all murderers nor impermissibly\nvague, apply with equal force to the amended version. (See People v. Jurado\n(2006) 38 Cal.4th 72, 146-147, conc. opn. of Kennard, J. [former lying-in-wait\nspecial circumstance does not violate the federal Constitution because it ―applies\nonly to a subclass of murderers, not to all murderers, and it is not\nunconstitutionally vague‖]; cf. People v. Beames (2007) 40 Cal.4th 907, 933-934\n[adopting the reasoning of the concurring opinion in People v. Jurado, supra, at\np. 146, to conclude that California‘s death penalty law as a whole is not\n\n                                          42\n\fimpermissibly broad because the enumerated special circumstances ―apply only to\na subclass of murderers, not to all murderers‖].)\n       Indeed, this court‘s decisions resolving Eighth Amendment challenges to\nother special circumstance provisions support the conclusion that the amended\nlying-in-wait special circumstance would satisfy federal constitutional\nrequirements for death eligibility even were the amendment to have made the\nspecial circumstance identical to lying-in-wait first degree murder. In People v.\nCatlin (2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, this court upheld the murder-by-poison special\ncircumstance finding against a claim that it violates the Eighth Amendment in that\nit merely repeats the elements of first degree murder-by-poison. In rejecting that\nchallenge, we observed in relevant part that murder by poison is particularly\nreprehensible: The murderer acts surreptitiously and thereby prevents the victim\nany chance at self-defense. (Id. at p. 159.) Like the murderer who poisons his\nvictim, the murderer who kills by lying in wait acts surreptitiously, concealing\nhimself or his purpose and making a surprise attack on his victim from a position\nof advantage, thereby denying the victim any chance of escape, aid, or self-\ndefense. It is no surprise that a murder committed by lying in wait historically has\nbeen viewed as ― ‗a particularly heinous and repugnant crime.‘ ‖ (People v.\nEdelbacher (1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1023.) That a crime historically has been\nconsidered more reprehensible than other murders provides ―a rational basis for\ndistinguishing those murderers who deserve to be considered for the death penalty\nfrom those who do not.‖ (People v. Davenport (1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 270, see id.\nat p. 269 [the torture-murderer‘s ― ‗ ―cold blooded intent to inflict pain for\npersonal gain or satisfaction‖ ‘ ‖ sets him apart from others who commit murder\nwith malice aforethought and renders torture murder to be one of the most\nreprehensible crimes].)\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\f       Defendant argues further that even were we to decide that the amended\nversion of the lying-in-wait special circumstance does not on its face offend the\nEighth Amendment, the special circumstance provision cannot be constitutionally\napplied in his case. Specifically, he asserts that because his liability for lying-in-\nwait first degree murder as an aider and abettor required a showing of intent to\nkill, there was no meaningful distinction between that theory of first degree\nmurder and the lying-in-wait special circumstance in his case, making it\nunnecessary for the jury to consider any additional information when deciding the\ntruth of the special circumstance allegation and rendering a true finding inevitable.\nDefendant‘s as-applied challenge is essentially the same argument as his facial\nattack, which we have rejected for the reasons discussed above. (See People v.\nLewis (2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 517.) The lying-in-wait special circumstance\nallegation that applied in this case, like its predecessor, ―is limited to intentional\nmurders that involve a concealment of purpose and a meaningful period of\nwatching and waiting for an opportune time to attack, followed by a surprise lethal\nattack on an unsuspecting victim from a position of advantage.‖ (People v. Carasi\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1263, 1310.) Here, the jury‘s finding was based on evidence\nthat defendant‘s actions satisfied the lying-in-wait special circumstance. With the\nintent that Miller would be killed, defendant drove with him to Anaheim on the\npretext of buying drugs, and led him into an alley where Lamb and Rump were\nwaiting to execute him. When defendant and Miller got halfway down the alley,\nLamb and Rump approached from behind and, from that position of advantage,\nLamb carried out a surprise attack by shooting Miller in the back of the head. The\napplication of the lying-in-wait special circumstance to such a scenario does not\noffend the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\f           3. Instruction that an aider and abettor and the direct perpetrator are\n               “equally guilty”\n       As previously mentioned, the prosecutor‘s theory of the case was that\ndefendant aided and abetted the murder of Scott Miller by luring him to a deserted\nalley where Lamb executed him with a shot to the back of the head. In connection\nwith that theory, the trial court instructed the jury on the principles of aider and\nabettor liability, introducing the theory with former CALCRIM No. 400. As the\ninstruction read at the time of defendant‘s trial, the court stated as follows. ―A\nperson may be guilty of a crime in two ways. One, he may have directly\ncommitted the crime. I will call that person the perpetrator. Two, he may have\naided and abetted the perpetrator, who directly committed the crime. A person is\nequally guilty of the crime whether he committed it personally or aided and\nabetted the perpetrator who committed it.‖ (See CALCRIM No. 400 (Aug. 2009),\nitalics added.)\n       Focusing on the ―equally guilty‖ language italicized above, defendant\nargues that instructing with former CALCRIM No. 400 violated his right to due\nprocess because the instruction misdescribed the prosecution‘s burden of proving\nhis liability as an aider and abettor and permitted the jury to convict him of first\ndegree murder based on the culpability of the perpetrator Lamb, without\nconsidering his own mental state. As defendant points out, an aider and abettor‘s\ncriminal liability may sometimes be greater than, or lesser than, that of the\nperpetrator. But, he argues, if the jurors concluded that Lamb premeditated and\ndeliberated the murder, they were ―duty bound‖ under former CALCRIM No. 400\nto find defendant guilty of first degree murder, even if they believed defendant did\nnot harbor the requisite mental state for first degree murder.\n       As a threshold matter, the Attorney General asserts that defendant‘s claim\nof instructional error was not preserved for appeal because defense counsel neither\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\fobjected to, nor sought modification of, former CALCRIM No. 400 at trial. This\ncourt has observed that, as a general matter, ― ‗ ―a party may not complain on\nappeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too\ngeneral or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or\namplifying language.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Castaneda (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1292, 1348;\naccord, People v. Samaniego (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1163 [challenge to\nformer CALCRIM No. 400‘s ― ‗equally guilty‘ ‖ language forfeited by the failure\nto object].) We also have recognized, however, that an appellate court may review\nany instruction, even when there was no objection or request for modification\nbelow, ―if the substantial rights of the defendant were affected thereby.‖ (§ 1259;\nsee, e.g., People v. Johnson (2015) 60 Cal.4th 966, 993.) Here, defendant\ncontends that instructing the jury with the ―equally guilty‖ language in former\nCALCRIM No. 400 violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess because it allowed the jury to convict him of first degree murder based on\nthe mental state of the perpetrator, without considering defendant‘s own mental\nstate. Were that argument to prevail, the error in giving former CALCRIM\nNo. 400 arguably would have affected defendant‘s substantial rights. (People v.\nSmithey (1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 976, fn. 7 [a claim that an instruction misstated the\nlaw or violated the due process clause ―is not of the type that must be preserved by\nobjection‖].) This court concluded in People v. Bryant, Smith and Wheeler (2014)\n60 Cal.4th 335, 432 (Bryant), that a former version of CALJIC No. 3.00, an\ninstruction similar to the one at issue here, ―generally stated a correct rule of law.‖\nWe nonetheless assumed the defendants‘ challenge to the ― ‗equally guilty‘ ‖\nlanguage in that instruction was not forfeited for lack of objection and reached the\nmerits of their claim, as permitted under section 1259. (Bryant, supra, at p. 432.)\nWe take a similar approach here.\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\f       As defendant correctly observes, former CALCRIM No. 400 was revised\nsubsequent to his trial. Prompting the modification that appears in the current\nversion of the instruction were two Court of Appeal decisions concluding that\nformer CALCRIM No. 400 was inconsistent with this court‘s opinion in People v.\nMcCoy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1111. In McCoy, this court rejected the notion that an\naider and abettor cannot be found guilty of a greater offense than that committed\nby the perpetrator. As we observed, aider and abettor liability for a killing is\nbased on the combined acts of all the principals and the aider and abettor‘s own\nmental state, which ― ‗ ―float[s] free‖ ‘ ‖ from the mental state of the perpetrator.\n(Id. at p. 1119.) When the aider and abettor‘s mental state is more culpable than\nthat of the actual perpetrator, the aider and abettor may be guilty of a more serious\ncrime. (Id. at p. 1120.)\n       In People v. Samaniego, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th 1148, and People v. Nero\n(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 504, the Courts of Appeal understood McCoy‘s reasoning\nto support the further proposition that an aider and abettor‘s criminal liability may\nbe less than that of the perpetrator, depending on the aider and abettor‘s mental\nstate. (Samaniego, supra, at pp. 1163-1164; Nero, supra, at pp. 513-517.)\nAlthough the Court of Appeal in Samaniego found that former CALCRIM\nNo. 400‘s reference to principals being ― ‗equally guilty‘ ‖ of a crime was a\ngenerally correct statement of the law, it concluded that the instruction was\nmisleading in light of the unique facts of that case, in which three defendants were\nconvicted of two counts of first degree murder but the evidence did not establish\nwhich of the three defendants was the actual perpetrator. (People v. Samaniego,\nsupra, at pp. 1162, 1165.) The Court of Appeal in Nero concluded, however, that\nformer CALJIC No. 3.00, the instruction similar to former CALCRIM No. 400,\nwas confusing even in unexceptional cases, and recommended that it be modified.\n(People v. Nero, supra, at p. 518.) The Judicial Council adopted that suggestion in\n\n                                          47\n\fApril 2010, revising former CALCRIM No. 400 by removing the word ―equally‖\nfrom the phrase ―equally guilty.‖5\n       This court found in Bryant, supra, 60 Cal.4th 335, that former CALJIC\nNo. 3.00, the instruction similar to the former version of CALCRIM No. 400 at\nissue here, generally stated a correct rule of law. (Id. at p. 433.) We observed that\n―[a]ll principals, including aiders and abettors, are ‗equally guilty‘ in the sense that\nthey are all criminally liable.‖ (Ibid.) Our decision in Bryant also recognized,\nhowever, that the instruction could be misleading in a case in which the principals\nmight be guilty of different crimes and the jury believes the instruction prevents\nsuch a verdict. (Ibid.) As explained below, the jury would not have been misled\nin this respect in the present matter.\n       First, there was no version of the evidence in this case suggesting that\ndefendant‘s mental state was less culpable than that of the actual killer.\nDefendant‘s statements to McLachlan detailing his significant involvement in the\nkilling — including his description of having used the pretext of a drug purchase\n\n5      In relevant part, CALCRIM No. 400 now reads as follows. ―A person may\nbe guilty of a crime in two ways. One, he or she may have directly committed the\ncrime. I will call that person the perpetrator. Two, he or she may have aided and\nabetted a perpetrator, who directly committed the crime. [¶] A person is guilty of\na crime whether he or she committed it personally or aided and abetted the\nperpetrator.‖ (See Judicial Council of Cal., Crim. Jury Instns. (Apr. 2010 supp.)\nBench Notes to CALCRIM No. 400, p. 28.)\n       Former CALJIC No. 3.00 likewise was modified in 2010, making the\n―equally guilty‖ language optional. That instruction now states in relevant part,\n―Persons who are involved in [committing] [or] [attempting to commit] a crime\nare referred to as principals in that crime. Each principal, regardless of the extent\nor manner of participation is [equally guilty.] [guilty of a crime.]‖ The use note\nindicates that in cases presenting the issue whether the aider and abettor‘s mens\nrea suggests his or her guilt may be greater or lesser than that of the actual\nperpetrator, the court should instruct with the ―guilty of a crime‖ language instead\nof ―equally guilty.‖ (Use Note to CALJIC No. 3.00 (Spring 2010 rev.).)\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fto lure Miller to the alley where Lamb and Rump were waiting, and later having\nhad words with Lamb for shooting Miller from behind rather than confronting him\nabout his transgressions face to face before killing him — left little question that\ndefendant ―share[d] the murderous intent of the actual perpetrator.‖ (People v.\nMcCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1118.)\n       Nor was there anything in the record suggesting that the jurors may have\nbelieved the ―equally guilty‖ language in former CALCRIM No. 400 required\nthem to determine defendant‘s criminal liability based on Lamb‘s mental state at\nthe time of the killing, rather than considering defendant‘s own mental state. The\ncourt introduced the subject of aider and abettor liability by reading former\nCALCRIM No. 400. It then instructed the jury with CALCRIM No. 401, which\nsets out the requirements for establishing aider and abettor liability. The jury\ntherefore was informed that for them to find defendant guilty of murder as an aider\nand abettor the prosecution must prove that defendant knew Lamb intended to kill\nMiller, that he intended to aid and abet Lamb in committing the killing, and that he\ndid in fact aid him in that killing, which would have cleared up any ambiguity\narguably presented by former CALCRIM No. 400‘s reference to principals being\n―equally guilty.‖ This is not a case like People v. Nero, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th\n504, in which the jury expressly asked during deliberations whether it could find\nthe aider and abettor codefendant guilty of a higher or lesser degree of murder than\nthe codefendant who was the actual killer, and the court responded by merely\nrereading former CALJIC No. 3.00, which included the ―equally guilty‖ language.\n(Nero, at p. 518.)\n       In sum, we conclude that, based on the record before us in this case, there\nwas no reasonable likelihood the jurors would have understood the ―equally\nguilty‖ language in former CALCRIM No. 400 to allow them to base defendant‘s\nliability for first degree murder on the mental state of the actual shooter, rather\n\n                                          49\n\fthan on defendant‘s own mental state in aiding and abetting the killing. (People v.\nClair (1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663; Estelle v. McGuire (1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72.)\n\n           4. Prior-murder special circumstance finding based on a murder that\n               occurred after the capital offense\n       After the jury returned its verdicts in the guilt phase of trial, the trial court\nconducted a court trial on the special circumstance allegation that defendant ―was\nconvicted previously of murder in the first or second degree‖ (§ 190.2,\nsubd. (a)(2)), and found the allegation to be true. The victim of that murder was\nCory Lamons, who was killed in April 2004. In June 2004, defendant pleaded\nguilty to second degree murder for his involvement in that crime.\n       Pointing out that the murder of Cory Lamons occurred two years after the\nmurder of Scott Miller in March 2002, defendant argues that the prior-murder\nspecial circumstance finding should be vacated because, contrary to federal\nconstitutional requirements, he was not on notice at the time of the Miller murder\nthat he was subjecting himself to death eligibility for a prior murder conviction.\nDefendant also complains that the prior-murder special circumstance allegation, as\napplied to him, is vague and overbroad and bears no relationship to the capital\nmurder itself, in violation of Eighth Amendment commands.\n       We observe that section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2), was in effect at the time\nof Miller‘s murder. This court long ago explained that ―[t]he unambiguous\nlanguage and purpose of section 190.2(a)(2) . . . require that a person such as\ndefendant, already convicted of murder in a prior proceeding, must be considered\neligible for the death penalty if convicted of first degree murder in a subsequent\ntrial. The order of the commission of the homicides is immaterial.‖ (People v.\nHendricks (1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 596.)\n       Defendant acknowledges that this court has repeatedly rejected\nconstitutional challenges to the prior-murder special circumstance provision, but\n\n\n                                           50\n\fasks that we reconsider our prior pronouncements in this regard. Because he\nprovides no new argument or legal developments warranting reexamination of our\nprior decisions, we decline his invitation to do so. (See People v. Rogers (2013)\n57 Cal.4th 296, 340-344; People v. Gurule (2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 635-637.)\n\n       B. Penalty Phase Claims\n\n           1. Victim impact testimony relating to a murder other than the capital\n               crime\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to\npresent victim impact evidence relating to noncapital crimes, including the\nnoncapital murder of Cory Lamons. He argues that such evidence is inadmissible\nas a factor in aggravation under state law and that its admission violated his rights\nto due process, trial before an impartial jury, and a reliable penalty determination\nguaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their state\nconstitutional counterparts. We conclude to the contrary that there was no\nstatutory or constitutional bar to admitting the evidence in question.\n\n               a. Background\n       The court, sitting as trier of fact in a bifurcated guilt phase proceeding to\ndetermine the truth of the prior-murder special-circumstance allegation, found\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that defendant previously had been convicted of the\nsecond degree murder of Cory Lamons. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(2).) At the penalty\nphase of trial, the court informed the jury of its finding and the prosecutor called\nseveral witnesses to testify regarding the circumstances of that crime as evidence\nof ―other violent criminal activity‖ pursuant to section 190.3, factor (b).\n       Prior to trial, the prosecutor had filed a written motion seeking admission of\nvictim impact testimony relating to defendant‘s ―other violent criminal activity‖\ngenerally. The defense filed a written response objecting to the presentation of\nsuch evidence generally, and arguing in part that even if victim impact evidence is\n\n                                          51\n\fpermitted under section 190.3, factor (b) (factor (b)), its admission should be\nlimited to testimony by the actual victim of the crime, and that testimony by\nrelatives does not fall within the scope of factor (b) evidence. At a pretrial hearing\non the motion, the prosecutor asserted that the defense position allowing victim\nimpact testimony relating to factor (b) crimes if the victim survived but not if the\nvictim died is a distinction not contemplated in the relevant case law. He argued\nthat, with regard to the Lamons murder, for example, it would be proper to call the\nvictim‘s mother to testify about the impact of that crime. Defense counsel\nsubmitted the issue based on his written motion objecting to the factor (b) victim\nimpact testimony generally. With regard to testimony by Lamons‘s mother\nspecifically, counsel added that the crime of murder speaks for itself and the\nfinality of murder is so obvious that the jury does not need a witness to testify\nabout it. The court concluded that the case law supported admission of testimony\nby Lamons‘s mother and overruled the defense objection without prejudice to\ncounsel‘s raising other objections to that evidence later in the proceedings.\n       With no further objections by defense counsel, the prosecutor called several\nwitnesses to testify regarding Lamons‘s murder. Cory Lamons‘s mother, Sharon\nThompson, was the last of these witnesses. During her testimony, she described\nhow life changed for her and Lamons‘s older sister after her son‘s death. For\nexample, she stated, she tries not to allow anyone to get close to her because she\ndoes not want to ―hurt like that again.‖ She also explained that the worst part for\nher may be knowing her son died a violent death and that she was not there to\nprotect him. Thompson told the jury that she moved out of the state after her son‘s\ndeath because she could not cope, that she misses him every day, and that ―[i]t will\nnever get any easier.‖\n       During closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Thompson‘s testimony\nseveral times, reminding the jury how life had changed for the worse for\n\n                                         52\n\fThompson and her daughter after Lamons‘s violent death, and urging the jury to\ngive weight to the impact of Lamons‘s murder on his mother when evaluating the\nfactor (b) evidence.\n\n               b. Discussion\n       Defendant contends that the admission of victim impact evidence relating\nto a crime other than the capital offense exceeded the constitutionally permissible\nscope of such aggravating evidence under the principles established in Payne v.\nTennessee (1991) 501 U.S. 808 (Payne). Defendant further asserts that the jury\nwas improperly influenced in its penalty determination by the irrelevant, highly\nemotional, and prejudicial victim impact evidence relating to the noncapital\nmurder of Cory Lamons.\n       As a preliminary matter, the Attorney General asserts that defendant‘s\nclaim is forfeited because defense counsel did not object to the factor (b) victim\nimpact evidence on the ground that the admissibility of such evidence is limited to\nthe circumstances of the capital offense. We find to the contrary that defendant‘s\nargument was fairly included in defense counsel‘s objection to the prosecutor‘s\nmotion to admit victim impact evidence relating to factor (b) criminal activity\ngenerally. The prosecutor‘s written motion asking the court to admit the victim\nimpact evidence argued that the law allowed jurors to consider not just victim\nimpact evidence relating to the capital murder, but also to consider victim impact\nevidence relating to the ―victims and surviving victims‖ of the defendant‘s\nfactor (b) crimes. In a written response, which was captioned, ―The Defense\nObjects to Victim Impact Statements of Factor (b) Crimes,‖ defense counsel\nmaintained that such evidence is not admissible at all unless it is relevant to\nproving that the incident in question met the definition of factor (b) criminal\nactivity. In a fallback position, counsel‘s written motion further argued that even\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\fif victim impact evidence is relevant to crimes unrelated to the capital offense, the\nadmission of such evidence should be limited to testimony by the actual victims,\nnot family or friends of the victims. Although counsel raised only the latter point\nat the hearing on the motion, he submitted the issue on his written motion. On this\nrecord, we conclude the claim that victim impact evidence is permissible only as it\nrelates to the capital offense is an argument that was fairly included in defendant‘s\nobjection below and, therefore, is preserved for appeal.\n       We reach a different conclusion, however, to the extent defendant claims\nthat the testimony by Lamons‘s mother was highly emotional and prejudicial and\nthereby improperly influenced the jury. As previously mentioned, the trial court\noverruled the defense objection to the factor (b) victim impact testimony without\nprejudice, expressly affording defense counsel an opportunity to raise other\nobjections to the challenged testimony. Counsel did not object to the testimony by\nLamons‘s mother on the ground it was unduly emotional or prejudicial, either\nbefore or during its presentation. Defendant, therefore, has not preserved that\nissue for appeal. (People v. Mills (2010) 48 Cal.4th 158, 170 [―[a]s a general\nmatter, when a trial court denies a motion without prejudice the matter is forfeited\nif not renewed‖].)\n       Although defendant did not forfeit his claim regarding the propriety of\nadmitting victim impact evidence relating to crimes other than the capital offense,\nas we explain, his contention does not succeed.\n       In making its penalty determination, the jury is authorized to consider three\ntypes of aggravating evidence, ―the circumstances of the crime of which the\ndefendant was convicted in the present proceeding‖ (§ 190.3, factor (a)), ―the\npresence . . . of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or\nattempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or\nviolence‖ (§ 190.3, factor (b)), and ―the presence . . . of any prior felony\n\n                                          54\n\fconviction‖ (§ 190.3, factor (c)). (See People v. Boyd (1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 774.)\nThis court has long construed factor (b) to encompass the ―nature and\ncircumstances‖ of the defendant‘s violent criminal activity (People v. Benson\n(1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 797), including the emotional impact on the victims of those\ncrimes. (People v. Jones (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1, 73; People v. Virgil (2011)\n51 Cal.4th 1210, 1276; People v. Bramit (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1221, 1241; People v.\nDemetrulias (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1, 39; People v. Price (1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 479\n[the penalty phase jury may properly consider evidence regarding the emotional\neffect on the victims of the defendant‘s prior violent crimes].)\n       In Booth v. Maryland (1987) 482 U.S. 496 (Booth) and South Carolina v.\nGathers (1987) 490 U.S. 805 (Gathers), the United State Supreme Court held that\nevidence and related argument regarding a capital murder victim‘s personal\ncharacteristics and the emotional impact of the victim‘s death on his or her family\nmembers were not relevant to any issue the jury was called upon to decide when\nselecting the appropriate penalty and, therefore, their admission was prohibited by\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n       This court has concluded, however, that Booth and Gathers had no bearing\non the admissibility of ―evidence or argument relating to the nature and\ncircumstances of other criminal activity involving the use or threat of force or\nviolence or the effect of such criminal activity on the victims.‖ (People v. Benson,\nsupra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 797; accord, People v. Karis (1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 640-\n641.) To the contrary, this court has found that evidence or argument regarding\nthe impact of a capital defendant‘s factor (b) crimes on the victims of those crimes\nwas ―highly relevant to the life-or-death decision.‖ (Benson, supra, at p. 797; see\nKaris, supra, at p. 641.)\n       In Payne, supra, 501 U.S. 808, 827, the high court overruled its prior\ndecisions in Booth and Gathers and announced that the Eighth Amendment does\n\n                                         55\n\fnot bar states from permitting the admission of victim impact evidence. As the\ncourt explained, ―a State may properly conclude that for the jury to assess\nmeaningfully the defendant‘s moral culpability and blameworthiness, it should\nhave before it at the sentencing phase evidence of the specific harm caused by the\ndefendant.‖ (Payne, supra, at p. 825.) Central to the court‘s decision in Payne\nwas the notion that the prosecution has a legitimate interest in counteracting the\nmitigating evidence that the defendant is entitled to present to the jury. (Ibid.)\nPayne criticized Booth for having ―unfairly weighted the scale in a capital trial,‖\nwhich places no limitations on the defendant‘s presentation of relevant mitigating\nevidence regarding his own circumstances but, under Booth, precluded the\nprosecution from showing the loss to the victim‘s family that resulted from the\ndefendant‘s homicide. (Payne, at. p. 822.)\n       Subsequent to Payne, this court held in People v. Edwards (1991)\n54 Cal.3d 787 (Edwards) that section 190.3, factor (a), regarding the\ncircumstances of the capital crime, authorizes ―evidence and argument on the\nspecific harm caused by the defendant, including the impact on the family of the\nvictim.‖ (Edwards, at p. 835.) And, as previously mentioned, both before and\nafter the decision in Payne, this court has repeatedly recognized the relevance of\nvictim impact evidence relating to factor (b) crimes of violence.\n       Defendant acknowledges the numerous decisions upholding the\nadmissibility of victim impact evidence under section 190.3, factor (b). He points\nout, however, that in People v. Boyde (1988) 46 Cal.3d 212, 249 (Boyde) this court\nreached the contrary conclusion that section 190.3, factor (b), did not permit\nvictims of the defendant‘s prior offenses to testify regarding the impact that the\ncrimes had had on their lives. As defendant correctly observes, no decision has\nexpressly addressed the apparent inconsistency between Boyde and the many\ndecisions approving evidence and argument regarding the impact on the victims of\n\n                                          56\n\fa defendant‘s factor (b) criminal activity. He argues in this regard that Boyde was\ncorrectly decided because the plain language of section 190.3, factor (b) does not\nsupport the conclusion that the electorate, in enacting the death penalty law,\nintended to allow victim impact testimony regarding crimes unrelated to the\ncapital murder.\n       Defendant‘s statutory construction argument is premised on a textual\ndistinction between section 190.3, factors (a) and (b). Specifically, he emphasizes\nthat although factor (a) expressly refers to the ―circumstances‖ of the capital\ncrime, no such language appears in factor (b). Defendant points out that Edwards\nfound the commonly understood meaning of the ―circumstances of the crime of\nwhich the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding‖ (§ 190.3, factor (a),\nitalics added), included ―the specific harm caused by the defendant,‖ which in turn\nincluded the impact on the victim‘s family. (Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835.)\nIn defendant‘s view, had the electorate intended factor (b) to permit victim impact\ntestimony, it likewise would have referred to the ―circumstances‖ of the prior\ncriminal activity.\n       Defendant fails to persuade that the textual distinction between factors (a)\nand (b) compels the conclusion that the electorate intended to preclude victim\nimpact testimony and argument relating to violent criminal activity other than the\ncapital crime. Notwithstanding the difference in text, and as previously discussed,\nthis court has long construed factor (b) as permitting ―evidence showing the\ncircumstances of the prior violent criminal activity.‖ (People v. Brown (1988)\n46 Cal.3d 432, 445, italics added; accord, People v. Benson, supra, 52 Cal.3d at\np. 797; People v. Karis, supra, 46 Cal.3d at p. 640.) Victim impact evidence\nrelating to factor (b) crimes, like evidence regarding other circumstances of that\ncriminal activity, serves to ―fully illuminate their seriousness‖ (People v. Holloway\n(2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 143), thereby assisting the penalty phase jury in its\n\n                                         57\n\fassessment of ―the character and record of the defendant.‖ (People v. Karis, supra,\nat p. 640.)\n       Nor are we persuaded that this court‘s decision in Edwards supports\ndefendant‘s statutory construction argument. Defendant is correct that Edwards\nfocused on section 190.3, factor (a)‘s express reference to the ―circumstances‖ of\nthe capital crime when construing that provision to contemplate the admission of\nvictim impact testimony. This was not the only basis of the holding in Edwards,\nhowever. Notably, Edwards also relied on People v. Benson, supra, 52 Cal.3d\n754, which found no impropriety in the prosecutor‘s argument regarding the\nimpact on the victims of the defendant‘s other violent criminal conduct. (Id. at\npp. 795-797.) Benson viewed that information as ―highly relevant to the life-or-\ndeath decision.‖ (Id. at p. 797.) In a footnote, Benson expressly declined to\ndecide whether Booth and Gathers would prohibit the admission of evidence and\nargument regarding the emotional impact of factor (b) criminal activity on the\nvictim‘s family. (Benson, at p. 797, fn. 9.) But Edwards read Benson to\n―strongly‖ imply that such evidence or argument fell within the scope of section\n190.3, factor (b). (Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835.) With that understanding\nof Benson in mind, the court in Edwards reasoned that ―[i]f victim impact\nevidence is permitted under factor (b), it should certainly be permitted under factor\n(a).‖ (Edwards, supra, at p. 835.)\n       We furthermore find no basis on which to conclude that Boyde states the\nbetter rule, as defendant maintains. In Boyde, the prosecution presented testimony\nby eight victims of the defendant‘s prior robberies and assaults. When describing\nthe circumstances of those incidents, the witnesses mentioned how the crimes had\naffected their lives. (Boyde, supra, 46 Cal.3d at pp. 247, 249.) The court in Boyde\nagreed with the defendant that the ―testimony by victims of other offenses about\nthe impact that the event had on their lives‖ was improperly admitted because it\n\n                                         58\n\fwas unrelated to any of the statutory aggravating factors. (Id. at p. 249.)\nHowever, that single sentence comprised the opinion‘s entire discussion of the\nissue; there was neither statutory analysis nor citation to authority. The decision‘s\ncursory treatment of the issue provides us with no reasoned basis on which to\nadopt its conclusion.\n       Until the present matter, this court‘s decisions have largely ignored Boyde‘s\nanomalous conclusion. Its holding, however, is inconsistent with every other\npronouncement by this court on the subject, including a decision that was issued in\nthe very same month that Boyde was filed. (See People v. Karis, supra, 46 Cal.3d\nat p. 641 [―we believe that the impact of a capital defendant‘s [noncapital] crimes\non the victims of those crimes is relevant to the penalty decision‖].) We therefore\nexpressly overrule Boyde to the extent it concludes that victim impact evidence\nrelating to factor (b) criminal activity is inadmissible, and reaffirm the unbroken\nline of authority beginning with People v. Benson, supra, 52 Cal.3d 754, which\nhas approved evidence and prosecutorial argument regarding the impact of the\ndefendant‘s factor (b) crimes on the victims of that criminal activity.\n       We conclude furthermore that evidence and argument regarding the impact\nof a factor (b) homicide on a member of the victim‘s family is relevant to the\njury‘s penalty determination, subject to the same limitations on its admissibility\nthat govern victim impact evidence as it relates to the capital crime. (See\nEdwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 836, quoting People v. Haskett (1982) 30 Cal.3d\n841, 864 [cautioning against the admission of ―irrelevant information or\ninflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury‘s attention from its proper role or\ninvites an irrational, purely subjective response‖].) Defense counsel argued below\nthat victim impact testimony by a noncapital homicide victim‘s family member is\nunnecessary because the severity of the crime of murder ―speaks for itself.‖ We\ndisagree. In the court‘s discretion, admission of victim impact testimony by the\n\n                                         59\n\floved one of a victim of a factor (b) homicide serves to ―fully illuminate [its]\nseriousness.‖ (People v. Holloway, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 143; see People v.\nPrice, supra, 1 Cal.4th at p. 479 [an emotional reaction from a factor (b) victim\nprovides ―an assessment of the seriousness of [the] defendant‘s criminal\nconduct‖]; see, e.g., People v. Johnson (2015) 60 Cal.4th 966, 976, 993 [the father\nof the victim of a manslaughter, evidence of which was admitted as a factor (b)\ncrime of violence, testified about his daughter and the impact of her death]; People\nv. Adams (2014) 60 Cal.4th 541, 557-558 [the husband and son of the victim of a\nmurder admitted as factor (b) evidence testified regarding how the fatal shooting\nhad affected them, both in its immediate aftermath and long term].) It would be\nanomalous to permit the penalty phase jury to consider the emotional suffering\ncaused to the victim of the defendant‘s nonfatal violent criminal activity but to\npreclude from the jury‘s moral assessment the suffering caused by the defendant‘s\ncommission of a factor (b) homicide.\n       As this court has observed in the context of capital crimes, ―[v]ictim impact\nevidence is admissible to establish the unique loss resulting from a murder and\nthereby to counteract the defendant‘s mitigating evidence.‖ (People v. Suff (2014)\n58 Cal.4th 1013, 1074-1075.) The same purpose is served when the loss results\nfrom a noncapital homicide presented under factor (b). In both settings, the jury is\nassisted in its assessment of the defendant‘s moral culpability and\nblameworthiness with evidence of ―the specific harm caused by the defendant.‖\n(Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835; see Payne, supra, 501 U.S. at p. 825.)\nVictim impact evidence relating to a factor (b) homicide is particularly relevant in\na case such as the present matter, in which the testimony by the homicide victim‘s\nmother regarding the impact of her son‘s murder on her and her daughter served as\na counterweight to defendant‘s case in mitigation. As previously recounted, the\ndefense mental health expert, Dr. Flores, testified that defendant‘s violent actions\n\n                                         60\n\fand behavior were governed by defendant‘s own moral and ethical code.\nDefendant himself attempted to minimize the seriousness of his prior acts of\nviolence by explaining to the jury that he directed his acts of violence at drug users\nand dealers, gang members, and convicts. More specifically, he stated that Cory\nLamons was a drug addict who owed him money and had stolen from two women\nhe knew.6\n       In addition to arguing that the electorate did not intend to permit victim\nimpact evidence relating to factor (b) crimes, defendant asserts that the admission\nof such evidence in his case amounted to federal constitutional error. He\nacknowledges that our decisions have consistently held that victim impact\nevidence relating to factor (b) criminal activity does not violate the federal or state\nConstitution. (See, e.g., People v. Virgil (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1210, 1276.) He\n\n\n6       We disapprove People v. Levitt (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 500, to the extent it\nheld that evidence regarding the impact of a homicide victim‘s death on a family\nmember is never relevant to the sentencing determination. The Levitt decision,\nwhich was cited with approval in Booth, supra, 482 U.S. 496, 505-505, footnote 7,\nstates that ―the fact that a victim‘s family is irredeemably bereaved can be\nattributable to no act of will of the defendant other than his commission of\nhomicide in the first place. Such bereavement is relevant to damages in a civil\naction, but it has no relationship to the proper purposes of sentencing in a criminal\ncase.‖ (Levitt, at pp. 516-517.) That proposition is plainly inconsistent with\nEdwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d 787, and our conclusion in the present matter, that, in\nthe court‘s discretion, such victim impact evidence is relevant to the jury‘s life-or-\ndeath decision. With regard to a judge‘s sentencing determination in a noncapital\ncase, Levitt‘s conclusion is contrary to article I, section 28, of the California\nConstitution, and section 1191.1, enacted in 1982 pursuant to initiative by the\npassage of Proposition 8, ―The Victim‘s Bill of Rights.‖ In relevant part, section\n1191.1 requires the criminal sentencing judge to consider a victim impact\nstatement by a deceased victim‘s ―next of kin‖ expressing his or her views\nregarding the crime. (See People v. Mockel (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 581, 587 [the\ncourt at sentencing had a duty under § 1191.1 to hear and consider the emotional,\ngrief-stricken statement by the wife of the vehicular manslaughter victim].)\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\fnonetheless seeks our reconsideration of those decisions in light of opinions from\nthe highest state courts of Illinois, Nevada, and Tennessee, which he claims have\nconcluded that such evidence violates the federal Constitution. (See People v.\nHope (Ill. 1998) 702 N.E.2d 1282, 1287-1289; Sherman v. State (Nev. 1998) 965\nP.2d 903, 913-914; State v. Nesbit (Tenn. 1998) 978 S.W.2d 872, 891, fn. 11;\nState v. Bigbee (Tenn. 1994) 885 S.W.2d 797, 812.)\n       Some of these out-of-state cases have held that victim impact evidence\nrelating to a noncapital crime is irrelevant under that state‘s death penalty scheme,\nwhich differs in significant respects from our own. (See, e.g., Sherman v. State,\n965 P.2d at pp. 913-914; see also People v. Davis (2009) 46 Cal.4th 539, 618\n[rejecting on similar grounds a nearly identical challenge to the admissibility of\nfactor (b) victim impact evidence]; People v. Virgil, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1276\n[relying on Davis to reject a similar challenge].) Although other out-of-state\ndecisions have concluded that Payne does not contemplate victim impact\ntestimony relating to a noncapital crime (see, e.g., Cantu v. State (Tex.Crim.App.\n1997) 939 S.W.2d 627, 637-638), we are neither bound nor persuaded by their\nconclusions. Indeed, Payne‘s reasoning suggests that it indirectly supports the\nadmissibility of factor (b) victim impact evidence and argument. As previously\ndiscussed, central to Payne‘s holding was the notion of striking a more appropriate\nbalance between the nearly unlimited scope of mitigating evidence that a\ndefendant is entitled to introduce and the prosecution‘s narrowly circumscribed\nevidence in aggravation.\n       We previously have declined to depart from our prior conclusion that the\nadmission of victim impact evidence regarding noncapital crimes does not violate\nthe federal Constitution. (People v. Virgil, supra, 51 Cal.45th at p. 1276; People\nv. Davis, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 618.) Defendant‘s argument here provides no\nadditional reasons to reconsider our precedents on the subject.\n\n                                         62\n\f           2. Addressing jurors individually during closing argument\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed reversible misconduct\nduring closing remarks at the penalty phase by addressing his argument to jurors\nindividually rather than as a group. We conclude that defendant has forfeited his\nclaim because counsel failed to object, and that his claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel based on that omission is more appropriately raised in a petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus.\n\n               a. Background\n       Near the end of the prosecutor‘s closing argument, he emphasized that\ndefendant himself was the only one to blame — not drug abuse, his family, his\nteachers, society or the prison system — for ―all the agony that he caused, for all\nthe hurt that he caused, for all the violence that he caused.‖ With regard to the\nharm caused by defendant, the prosecutor argued that ―[j]ustice will be served\nwhen those who are not injured by crime feel as indignant as those who are.\nThat‘s when justice is served. When people who are not directly injured by the\ncrime feel as indignant as those that are.‖ Continuing with this theme, the\nprosecutor then addressed each of the 12 jurors individually as follows:\n       ―Are you indignant yet, sir?\n       ―Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, sir? Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, sir? Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, sir? Are you indignant yet, sir?\n       ―How about you, sir?\n       ―How about you sir, Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, ma‘am?\n       ―How about you, sir?\n       ―How about you ma‘am?\n\n\n                                         63\n\f       ―How about you ma‘am?\n       ―How about you ma‘am?‖\n       Nothing in the record suggests that any juror responded to the prosecutor‘s\nindividual query.\n       Directing his remarks to the jury as a whole again, the prosecutor then\nstated, ―Enough is enough,‖ and asked jurors whether they feel what the family\nmembers of Scott Miller and Cory Lamons feel. ―Don‘t say yes,‖ the prosecutor\ncautioned, ―because you don‘t unless you have lost a daughter or a son.‖ The\nprosecutor urged the jury, however, to ―put a value on it. Put a value on it. Is it\nenough yet?‖ Referring to the two murders as defendant‘s ―partial trail of blood\nand horror,‖ the prosecutor reiterated, ―Enough is enough,‖ and argued that\ndefendant had forfeited his right to live and ―so richly deserves the ultimate\npunishment.‖\n\n                  b. Discussion\n       Defendant argues that the prosecutor committed egregious misconduct by\naddressing each juror individually during closing argument in violation of his right\nto due process.\n       ― ‗ ―When a prosecutor‘s intemperate behavior is sufficiently egregious that\nit infects the trial with such a degree of unfairness as to render the subsequent\nconviction a denial of due process, the federal Constitution is violated.‖ ‘\n[Citations.]‖ (People v. Shazier (2014) 60 Cal.4th 109, 127.) ― ‗ ―Prosecutorial\nmisconduct that falls short of rendering the trial fundamentally unfair may still\nconstitute misconduct under state law if it involves the use of deceptive or\nreprehensible methods to persuade the trial court or the jury.‖ [Citation.]‘ ‖\n(Ibid.; accord, People v. Linton (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1146, 1205.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\f       This court‘s decision in People v. Wein (1958) 50 Cal.2d 383, 395, states\nthe rule that ―arguments should be addressed to the jury as a body and the practice\nof addressing individual jurors by name during the argument should be\ncondemned rather than approved . . . .‖ Relying on Wein, the Court of Appeal\nheld in People v. Sawyer (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 66, 78, that the prosecutor should\nnot have addressed the jurors individually as ―sir‖ or ―ma‘am‖ during closing\nargument. More recently, this court relied on Wein to conclude in People v.\nFreeman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 517-518, that it was improper during penalty phase\nargument for the prosecutor to quote a seated juror‘s voir dire response describing\nthe role of a juror in the death penalty process. Without expressly relying on\nWein, we reached a similar conclusion in People v. Riggs (2008) 44 Cal.4th 248,\n325-326, finding it improper for the prosecutor to have posted a chart during\npenalty phase argument displaying questionnaire comments regarding the purpose\nof the death penalty that had been written by 12 prospective jurors, some of whom\nwere members of the penalty phase jury.\n       To preserve a claim of prosecutorial misconduct for appeal, however, the\ndefendant must have raised a timely objection and requested that the jury be\nadmonished to disregard the offending remarks. (People v. Linton, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 1205; People v. Huggins (2006) 38 Cal.4th 175, 251-252.) Defense\ncounsel neither objected to the prosecutor‘s rhetorical questions, nor asked the\ncourt to admonish the jury. Defendant therefore has forfeited his claim of\nmisconduct. (People v. Thomas (2012) 54 Cal.4th 908, 944.)\n       Defendant does not attempt to explain counsel‘s omission. Nor does he\nargue that any of the exceptions to the forfeiture rule are applicable here. Rather,\nhe claims that the failure to object and ask for an admonition constituted a\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel that\nrequires reversal of the death sentence.\n\n                                           65\n\f        The two-prong standard governing claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is well settled. ― ‗ ―In assessing claims of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel, we consider whether counsel‘s representation fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and whether the\ndefendant suffered prejudice to a reasonable probability, that is, a probability\nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. [Citations.]‖ ‘ ‖ (People v.\nBrown (2014) 59 Cal.4th 86, 109; see generally People v. Ledesma (1987)\n43 Cal.3d 171, 216-218; Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466 U.S. 668, 688, 693-\n696.)\n        This court has recognized that counsel has wide discretion in choosing the\nmeans by which to provide constitutionally adequate representation. (People v.\nLedesma, supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 216.) We also have observed that ―[a]n appellate\ncourt‘s ability to determine from the record whether an attorney has provided\nconstitutionally deficient legal representation is in the usual case severely\nhampered by the absence of an explanation of an attorney‘s strategy.‖ (People v.\nWeaver (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 955.) For this reason, we long ago adopted the\nrule that ― ‗[i]f the record on appeal fails to show why counsel acted or failed to\nact in the instance asserted to be ineffective, unless counsel was asked for an\nexplanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no\nsatisfactory explanation, the claim must be rejected on appeal. [Citations.]‘ ‖\n(Ibid.; see generally People v. Mendoza Tello (1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266-268.)\nThe merits of such claims are more appropriately resolved, not on the basis of the\nappellate record, but rather by way of a petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n(Mendoza Tello, at pp. 266-267.)\n        Defendant acknowledges that defense counsel was neither asked to provide,\nnor offered, an explanation for failing to object to the portion of the prosecutor‘s\nclosing argument in which he addressed the jurors individually rather than as a\n\n                                          66\n\fgroup. He asserts, however, that there could be no satisfactory explanation for\ncounsel‘s omission. Specifically, he observes that an objection and request for\nadmonition would not have raised any issue adverse to the defense case. Rather,\nhe posits, it would have diffused a damaging argument that pandered to the\npassions and prejudice of the jury.\n       Defendant‘s assertion notwithstanding, we cannot say ― ‗ ―there simply\ncould be no satisfactory explanation‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Mendoza Tello, supra,\n15 Cal.4th at p. 266) for defense counsel‘s failure to object. Indeed, one possible\ntactical reason for the omission appears in the record itself, which indicates that\ndefense counsel expressly referred to the challenged argument during his own\nclosing remarks. Counsel argued to the jurors that by inquiring, ―Are you\nindignant? Are you indignant? Are you indignant?‖ the prosecutor was asking\nthem to make their penalty decision based on hate. Counsel then explained to the\njury that the penalty decision must be based, not on hate, but on weighing the\naggravating factors and the mitigating factors. Counsel may have made a\ndeliberate tactical choice not to object to the prosecutor‘s argument in order to use\nit to advantage during his own closing statement. Because we cannot confidently\nconclude based solely on the appellate record whether counsel had a legitimate\nreason for his omission, however, we do not reach the merits of defendant‘s claim\nof constitutionally inadequate assistance. Here, like in most cases, defendant‘s\nclaim is more appropriately presented by way of a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus. (See People v. Snow (2003) 30 Cal.4th 43, 94-95; People v. Michaels\n(2002) 28 Cal.4th 486, 527.)\n\n           3. Cumulative effect of asserted errors\n       Defendant argues that the cumulative impact of the asserted errors at the\nguilt and penalty phases resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial and unreliable\n\n\n\n                                          67\n\fverdicts in violation of his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nBecause we have rejected all of defendant‘s claims of error, there is nothing to\ncumulate and, in any event, we reject his claim that any asserted cumulative effect\nwarrants reversal.\n\n           4. Constitutionality of California’s death penalty law\n       Defendant challenges the constitutionality of various features of\nCalifornia‘s capital sentencing scheme, alone and in combination. He\nacknowledges that this court has repeatedly rejected such challenges but urges that\nwe reconsider our prior conclusions. We decline his request to do so. (See People\nv. Schmeck (2005) 37 Cal.4th 240, 303-304.)\n\n               a. Narrowing function\n       Section 190.2, which sets forth the special circumstances that render a\nmurderer eligible for the death penalty, including felony murder and lying in wait,\nadequately narrows the class of death-eligible murderers as required by the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments. (People v. Myles (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1181, 1224-\n1225; People v. Frye (1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 1028-1029; see also ante, pt. II.A.2.)\nContrary to defendant‘s assertion, the electorate did not intend by its adoption of\nthe 1978 death penalty law to make nearly every first degree murder death\neligible, nor did it accomplish that result. (People v. Merriman (2014) 60 Cal.4th\n1, 105; People v. Jones (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1, 85.)\n\n               b. Circumstances of the crime as a factor in aggravation\n       Section 190.3, factor (a), which directs the jury to consider as evidence in\naggravation the ―circumstances of the crime,‖ has not resulted in the ―freakish and\nwanton‖ imposition of the death penalty, either by allowing the admission of\nextensive evidence regarding the impact of the murder on the victim‘s family\nmembers, friends, coworkers, and the community at large, or by permitting\n\n\n                                         68\n\fprosecutors to argue that the features of the murder, even features squarely at odds\nwith those in other murder cases, are ―aggravating‖ circumstances within the\nmeaning of the statute. (People v. Merriman, supra, 60 Cal.4th at pp. 105-106;\nPeople v. Brown (2004) 33 Cal.4th 382, 401; People v. Pollack (2004) 32 Cal.4th\n1153, 1180-1183.)\n\n               c. Penalty phase procedures\n       The federal Constitution does not require that the penalty phase jury make\nunanimous findings beyond a reasonable doubt regarding the existence of\nparticular aggravating factors, or that the aggravating factors outweigh the\nmitigating factors. (People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1215; People v. Clark\n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 1007; see People v. Hawthorne (1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 79\n[the penalty determination ― ‗is inherently moral and normative, not factual‘ ‖ and\ntherefore not susceptible of a burden of proof].) The United States Supreme\nCourt‘s decisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment‘s jury trial guarantee (see\nCunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270; Blakely v. Washington (2004)\n542 U.S. 296; Ring v. Arizona (2002) 536 U.S. 584; Apprendi v. New Jersey\n(2000) 530 U.S. 466) do not call into question these conclusions. (People v.\nLinton, supra, at p. 1215.)\n       Similarly, neither the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth\nAmendment, nor the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, requires\nthat jurors in a capital case be instructed that they may return a verdict of death\nonly if persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors exist, that\nthe aggravating factors outweigh the factors in mitigation, and that death is the\nappropriate penalty. (People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 1215-1216.)\n       ―The lack of written or other specific findings by the jury regarding\naggravating factors did not deprive defendant of his federal due process and\n\n\n\n                                          69\n\fEighth Amendment rights to meaningful appellate review, violate equal protection\nof the laws or violate defendant‘s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.‖\n(People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1216; accord, People v. Rodriguez\n(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 777-778.)\n       Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, there is no Eighth Amendment\nrequirement that California‘s death penalty scheme provide for intercase\nproportionality review, either in the trial court or on review. (People v. Jones,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 87; People v. Lang (1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1043; see Pulley\nv. Harris (1984) 465 U.S. 37, 50-52 [no constitutional requirement that state\ncourts conduct intercase proportionality review].)\n       Permitting the jury to consider prior unadjudicated criminal conduct as a\nfactor in aggravation under section 190.3, factor (b), and imposing no requirement\nthat the jury unanimously find the defendant guilty of the unadjudicated crimes\ndoes not violate a defendant‘s right to due process or his Sixth Amendment jury\ntrial right. (People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 1007; People v. Barnwell\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1038, 1059; People v. Balderas (1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 204-205.)\n       Use of adjectives such as ―extreme‖ and ―substantial‖ in section 190.3,\nfactors (d) and (g), respectively, does not create a constitutionally impermissible\nbarrier to the jury‘s consideration of a defendant‘s mitigating evidence. (People v.\nDeHoyos (2013) 57 Cal.4th 79, 150; People v. Adcox (1988) 47 Cal.3d 207, 270.)\nThe trial court was not constitutionally required to instruct the jury that the\nstatutory mitigating factors were relevant solely to mitigation. Nor did the court‘s\ninstruction directing the jury to consider ―whether or not‖ certain mitigating\nfactors were present invite the jury to use the absence of such factors as an\naggravating circumstance, in violation of state law and the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. (People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1216; People v. Doolin\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f(2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 456; People v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1,\n123.)\n\n                d. Procedural safeguards\n        Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, the failure to afford capital defendants at\nthe penalty phase some of the procedural safeguards guaranteed to noncapital\ndefendants, such as juror unanimity and written findings, does not violate the\nequal protection clause. The two groups of defendants are not similarly situated.\n(People v. Whalen (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 91; People v. McKinnon (2011) 52 Cal.4th\n610, 698; People v. Watson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 652, 703-704.) Nor does\nCalifornia‘s failure to adopt procedural safeguards utilized by other states in their\ncapital sentencing proceedings deprive California‘s capital defendants of their\nrights to due process, equal protection, and a reliable death verdict guaranteed by\nthe Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. (People v. McKinnon, supra, at\np. 698.)\n\n                e. International law\n        ―Defendant contends that, even assuming that the death penalty itself does\nnot violate international norms of decency, the broad reach of California‘s capital\npunishment scheme and use of the death penalty as a regular form of punishment\nfor substantial numbers of crimes are contrary to those international standards and\nconstitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment. We have addressed and\nrepeatedly rejected the identical argument that California imposes death as\n‗ ―regular punishment for substantial numbers of crimes.‖ ‘ [Citations.]\nDefendant presents no new arguments that would prompt reconsideration of our\nprior conclusion.‖ (People v. Merriman, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 107.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          71\n\f               f. Constitutionality of California’s capital sentencing scheme as a\n                   whole\n       As mentioned above, defendant acknowledges that this court previously has\nrejected all of the arguments he raises here asserting certain constitutional\ninadequacies in the death penalty law. He complains, however, that this court‘s\nprior conclusions are constitutionally infirm in that they did not take into account\nthe cumulative impact of the asserted defects or consider the functioning of the\ncapital sentencing scheme as a whole. He asks that we reconsider each of his\nclaims ―in the context of California‘s entire death penalty scheme.‖\n       This court recently has rejected arguments identical to the one defendant\npresents. We find no merit to his contention for the reason stated in People v.\nWilliams (2013) 58 Cal.4th 197, 296: ―We have individually rejected each of\ndefendant‘s challenges to California‘s death penalty law, and ‗[s]uch claims are no\nmore compelling . . . when considered together. . . .‘ [Citation.]‖ (Accord, People\nv. Debose (2014) 59 Cal.4th 177, 214; see People v. Williams (2008) 43 Cal.4th\n584, 648 [―California‘s capital sentencing scheme as a whole provides adequate\nsafeguards against the imposition of arbitrary or unreliable death judgments‖];\nPeople v. Gurule, supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 663-664 [same].)\n\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\f                              III. CONCLUSION\n     We affirm the judgment in its entirety.\n                                                CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C. J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCHIN, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                      73\n\f                  CONCURRING OPINION BY CUÉLLAR, J.\n\n       It is well and widely known in legal circles –– and codified in the statutes of\nthis state –– that only relevant evidence is admissible. (Evid. Code, § 350.) The\nrationale for the rule is as simple as it is important: Excluding irrelevant evidence\nfurthers the goal of rational, impartial factfinding and decisionmaking by the jury.\n       Where the defendant‘s life is at stake, the need for reliability is heightened.\n(Caldwell v. Mississippi (1985) 472 U.S. 320, 340.) Courts must take special care\nin capital cases to ensure that the evidence offered at the penalty phase is relevant\nto the question of who should live and who should die. As we have long held, the\nfocus of that individualized inquiry is the defendant‘s character and the\ncircumstances of the crime for which the defendant is being tried. (People v. Dyer\n(1988) 45 Cal.3d 26, 70; accord, Woodson v. North Carolina (1976) 428 U.S. 280,\n304 (plur. opn. of Stewart, J.).) Evidence that is not relevant to either of those\nfactors is not relevant to the penalty determination and should be excluded.\n(People v. Boyd (1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 773-775 (Boyd); see generally People v.\nHaskett (1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 864 [―irrelevant information . . . that diverts the\n[penalty] jury‘s attention from its proper role . . . should be curtailed‖].)\n       In distinguishing between what is relevant and what is not, courts must also\nbear in mind the differing rules governing the admissibility of aggravating and\nmitigating evidence. Although the jury must be allowed to consider any aspect of\na defendant‘s character or record that may be offered as a basis for leniency, there\nis no corresponding requirement that it also be allowed to consider every\n\fcontention the prosecution might advance as a justification for the death penalty.\n(Boyd, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 775.) Rather, as the majority acknowledges (maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 54), the evidence in aggravation is limited strictly to those factors\nenumerated in Penal Code section 190.3. (Boyd, at p. 775.)\n       In this case, the trial court admitted evidence at the penalty phase that was\nnot authorized by Penal Code section 190.3. Nor was it relevant to defendant‘s\ncharacter or to the circumstances of the crime for which defendant was being tried.\nYet the majority finds no error. I respectfully disagree.\n                                           I.\n       Defendant murdered Cory Lamons in April 2004. He pleaded guilty to\nsecond degree murder in June 2006 and was sentenced to 45 years to life.\n       Three years later, defendant was charged with the 2002 murder of Scott\nMiller, which is the subject of this automatic appeal. At the penalty phase of the\nproceeding, Lamons‘s mother, Sharon Thompson, was called to testify. Thompson\nwas not a witness to her son‘s murder, nor did she have any information about the\ncircumstances of her son‘s death or about the capital crime that led to defendant‘s\nconviction in this proceeding. The prosecution called her to the stand instead to\ntalk about how her son‘s death had affected her life. Thompson‘s testimony was\nplainly genuine — and heartfelt: ―Well, first thing you do is you can‘t believe that\nit really is happening to you. And then it feels like the air is being totally sucked\nout of the whole room. Then you keep thinking it really isn‘t happening, that\nsomebody is pulling a joke on you. [¶] Then the rest of your life you keep looking\non the street thinking someone has pulled a really horrible joke on you and you are\ngoing to see him walking down the street. [¶] His sister helped raise him, and that\nwas really horrible. And then the worst part of it is knowing that they died a\nviolent death. Because you weren‘t there to protect them. [¶] I miss him every\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fday of my life. I actually moved out of the state after he died because I just\ncouldn‘t take it anymore.‖\n       Thompson added that her grief never gets any better or any easier. When\nremembering her son‘s birthday a week earlier at her workplace, she broke down\nand cried. And when asked how she had changed as a result of her son‘s murder,\nThompson reflected, ―I think I am more closed up. I try not to let anybody get\nclose to me. I don‘t want to hurt like that ever again.‖\n                                          II.\n       No one disputes that Thompson‘s testimony would have been admissible at\nthe sentencing hearing following defendant‘s conviction for her son‘s murder.\n(Pen. Code, § 1191.1.) Nor is there any doubt that her testimony would have been\nrelevant as victim impact evidence at the penalty phase, had this capital proceeding\nbeen based on Lamons‘s murder. (Pen. Code, § 190.3, factor (a); see People v.\nCage (2015) 62 Cal.4th 256, 287-289 [upholding the admissibility of testimony\nfrom the victim‘s mother about the impact of her daughter‘s death].) The question\nhere is different: whether Thompson‘s testimony concerning her reaction to one\nmurder was relevant to the jury‘s penalty determination for an unrelated capital\nmurder. So far as my research reveals, every other jurisdiction to have considered\nthe admissibility of this category of evidence has concluded that it is not relevant.\nThe majority‘s decision to the contrary mistakenly conflates two distinct categories\nof evidence: evidence that tends to show the circumstances of an uncharged crime,\nand evidence of the uncharged crime‘s effect on family or friends who were neither\nvictims of nor witnesses to the crime. Our case law offers ample justification for\nthe admissibility of the first category of evidence. Thompson‘s testimony,\nhowever, falls in the second category.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                          A.\n       California‘s death penalty statute provides that a defendant‘s character and\nrecord, including the presence or absence of other violent criminal activity by the\ndefendant, is relevant to the penalty determination. (Pen. Code, § 190.3, factor (b)\n(factor (b)); People v. Arias (1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 193.) As we have previously\nexplained, ― ‗[t]he presence of such activity suggests that the capital offense is the\nproduct more of the defendant‘s basic character than of the accidents of his\nsituation, whereas its absence suggests the opposite.‘ ‖ (People v. Ashmus (1991)\n54 Cal.3d 932, 982, quoting People v. Gallego (1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 208-209,\nfn. 1 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) To aid in the determination of the connection\nbetween the charged murder and the defendant‘s character, factor (b) allows the\nPeople to present the jury with not only the fact of the violent criminal activity, but\nalso the ―nature and circumstances‖ of the defendant‘s violent conduct. (People v.\nBenson (1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 797 (Benson).)\n       At the penalty phase in Benson, supra, 52 Cal.3d 754, for example, the\nPeople offered testimony from four children whom the defendant had sexually\nassaulted or threatened to assault. Their heartbreaking testimony included an\naccount of the suffering they had experienced and the emotional scars they\ncontinued to carry. (Id. at pp. 795-796.) We explained that the children‘s\ntestimony about the nature and circumstances of the crimes and the prosecutor‘s\nrelated argument were ―highly relevant to the life-or-death decision,‖ in that they\ntended to rebut the defendant‘s attempt to minimize his culpability and his\nsuggestion that the capital murder victims enjoyed the molestation. (Id. at p. 797.)\n       We drew a distinction, though, between two kinds of evidence: one kind\nconcerning ―the effect of such criminal activity on the victims‖ (the type of\nevidence presented in Benson), and another involving indicia of ―the emotional\nimpact of such criminal activity on the victim‘s family‖ (as in the case now before\n\n                                           4\n\fus). (Id. at p. 797 & fn. 9; see also People v. Karis (1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 640, 641\n[similarly distinguishing between evidence showing ―the impact of the crime on\nthe victim‖ and evidence of the impact of the crime ―on the family of the\nvictim‖].)1 Evidence of the former kind can be relevant to the penalty\ndetermination insofar as it tends to illuminate the nature of the defendant‘s act,\nbeyond the simple fact that defendant engaged in or was convicted of criminal\nactivity involving the use of force or violence. (See People v. Jones (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1, 24-25, 72-73 [evidence that the stabbing victim, a teacher at the\ndefendant‘s high school, quit teaching, was institutionalized for a period of time,\nand remained under psychiatric care 25 years later tended to show the viciousness\nof the attack and the victim‘s vulnerability]; People v. Virgil (2011) 51 Cal.4th\n1210, 1232, 1276 [evidence that the stabbing and robbery victim underwent\nmultiple surgeries and suffered persistent digestive difficulties, facial\ndisfigurement, impaired vision, and sleeping difficulties tended to show the\nviciousness and extent of the attack]; People v. Bramit (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1221,\n1228-1229, 1241 [evidence that the victims of armed bank robberies continued to\nexperience fear tended to show the violence of the defendant‘s conduct]; People v.\nDemetrulias (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1, 10, 39 [evidence that the elderly victim of a\nstabbing and beating was no longer able to live independently tended to show the\nviciousness of the attack and the victim‘s vulnerability]; People v. Holloway\n(2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 143-144 [evidence that the burglary and assault victim\nsought psychological treatment and purchased a handgun, which she kept under her\npillow, tended to show the brutality of the defendant‘s conduct]; People v. Price\n\n\n1      People v. Edwards (1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 835 (Edwards), asserted that\nBenson ―strongly implies‖ that both types of evidence were admissible. But\nEdwards‘s dictum was plainly inconsistent with the disclaimer in Benson and\nKaris and is entitled to no weight.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 479 [questions calling for an emotional reaction from two\npeace officers, who were disarmed and forced into the trunk of their patrol car by\nthe defendant, were not improper because ―they could be understood as merely an\nassessment of the seriousness of defendant‘s criminal conduct‖].)\n       On the other hand, the grief of those who were neither victims of the crime\nnor witnesses to it is not relevant evidence of the nature or circumstances of the\ndefendant‘s violent activity. The majority does not directly address how the\nreactions of someone who did not witness or experience a crime could be a basis\nfor making inferences about the nature of the crime. Instead, the majority contends\nthat it would be ―anomalous‖ to allow victims of a defendant‘s nonfatal criminal\nactivity to testify while precluding testimony from the surviving family and friends\nof a homicide victim. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 60.) But there is no anomaly. Anyone\n— including surviving family and friends — who witnessed the criminal activity\nthat is introduced under factor (b), whether as a victim or as an observer, may\ntestify about the circumstances of that crime. (Cf. People v. Streeter (2012) 54\nCal.4th 205, 264 [photographs of torture victim‘s injuries and tape recording of\nvictim‘s screams in the ambulance were relevant to show the circumstances of the\ncrime under Pen. Code, § 190.3, factor (a) as well as ―the immediate impact of the\ncrime on the victim‖].) Such testimony could include evidence of the enduring\nphysical or emotional impact of that crime, to the extent those effects tend to show\nthe nature of a defendant‘s acts. But factor (b) does not contemplate an inquiry\ninto the emotional state of those who are complete strangers to a crime –– indeed,\nit does not contemplate such an inquiry even if they are tied by kinship or\nfriendship to those who were victims. Such testimony sheds no light on the\nvulnerability of the victim or the viciousness of the defendant‘s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                           B.\n       The majority also analogizes Thompson‘s testimony about the loss of her\nson to the victim impact testimony from surviving family and friends of the capital\nmurder victim that the high court authorized in Payne v. Tennessee (1991) 501\nU.S. 808 (Payne), and that we recognized as a legitimate aggravating factor in\nEdwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d 787. Yet this analogy is unpersuasive, because it\noverlooks the legal distinction between information related to an uncharged crime\nand evidence that concerns the capital murder for which the defendant is on trial.\n       That distinction exists because the choice between death and life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole properly rests on two — and only\ntwo — categories of evidence: the defendant‘s character, and the circumstances of\nthe capital murder itself. (People v. Dyer, supra, 45 Cal.3d at p. 70.) As part of\nthe latter category of evidence, a jury may consider ―the harm caused by the\ndefendant as a result of the crime charged‖ (Payne, supra, 501 U.S. at p. 819,\nitalics added), ―the specific harm caused by the crime in question‖ (id. at p. 825,\nitalics added), and ―the human cost of the crime of which the defendant stands\nconvicted‖ (id. at p. 827, italics added). The purpose of such evidence is to remind\nthe jury that just as the defendant should be considered a ―uniquely individual\nhuman being[]‖ (Woodson v. North Carolina, supra, 428 U.S. at p. 304 (plur. opn.\nof Stewart, J.)), so too is the victim an individual to his or her family and to society\nin general. (Payne, at p. 825.) To withhold evidence about the capital murder\nvictim would ―prevent the jury from having before it all the information necessary\nto determine the proper punishment for a first-degree murder.‖ (Ibid.)\n       But Payne did not articulate a rationale for the admission of testimony\nconcerning the emotional reactions of those who, while related to a victim of a\ndefendant‘s prior forcible or violent criminal conduct, are strangers to the capital\ncrime, and the majority opinion offers none. Just as, in Price, it would not have\n\n                                           7\n\fbeen appropriate to call the spouses of the peace officers who were locked in their\npatrol car‘s trunk to testify about the effect of their husbands‘ ordeal on their own\nlives, Thompson‘s feelings about her son‘s murder were not relevant under factor\n(b) to the determination of the appropriate penalty for Miller‘s murder. To be sure,\nThompson‘s feelings were genuine, profound, and indisputably painful and\nmoving. But they shed no light on defendant‘s conduct in killing her son or on the\nlikelihood that the capital murder of which he was convicted was a product of his\ncharacter rather than an accident of his situation.\n       It is not sufficient to assert, as the majority does, that factor (b) evidence\nencompasses ― ‗the circumstances of the prior violent criminal activity.‘ ‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 57.) To be admissible, the particular circumstances sought to be\nintroduced must still be relevant to the jury‘s task of fixing the penalty. (Evid.\nCode, §§ 210, 350; see St. Clair v. Commonwealth (Ky. 2014) 451 S.W.3d 597,\n627, 631 [―evidence of the circumstances of [an uncharged] murder is qualitatively\ndifferent from evidence of the crime‘s impact on its victim,‖ the latter having ―a\ncomplete failure of relevance‖].) For purposes of factor (b), such circumstances\nare relevant only to the extent they tend to illuminate the nature of the defendant‘s\nprior violent or forcible act.\n       The majority‘s reasoning is also at odds with decisions in a number of our\nsister jurisdictions. (See Sherman v. State (Nev. 1998) 965 P.2d 903, 914 [peace\nofficer‘s testimony about the effect an uncharged murder had on the victim‘s\ncommunity ―is not relevant‖ to an aggravating factor or the circumstances of the\ncharged murder]; Gilbert v. State (Okla.Crim.App. 1997) 951 P.2d 98, 117\n[testimony from victims‘ family members about the impact of uncharged murders\nwas irrelevant to the penalty determination]; State v. Bigbee (Tenn. 1994) 885\nS.W.2d 797, 812 [prosecutor‘s argument concerning the impact of an uncharged\nmurder on the victim‘s family was error because the impact was ―irrelevant‖ to the\n\n                                           8\n\fpenalty determination].) The majority is quite correct that it is not bound by the\nabundant out-of-state authority rejecting its view, but the analysis in those cases\nseems more thorough and persuasive to me than what the majority provides.\n       In People v. Hope (Ill. 1998) 702 N.E.2d 1282, for example, the Supreme\nCourt of Illinois overturned a penalty judgment on the ground that a widow was\nimproperly allowed to testify about the loss of her husband. (Id. at pp. 1287-1289.)\nThe court determined that Illinois‘s victim‘s rights statute, which resembles our\nVictim‘s Bill of Rights (Pen. Code, § 1191.1), did ―not contemplate . . . an\nexpansion of victim impact statements to include evidence from victims other than\nthe victims of the offense on trial.‖ (Hope, at p. 1287.) Nor did the Hope court\nfind any other indication that the widow‘s testimony could be relevant to the jury‘s\npenalty determination: ―Payne clearly contemplates that victim impact evidence\nwill come only from a survivor of the murder for which the defendant is presently\non trial, not from survivors of offenses collateral to the crime for which defendant\nis being tried.‖ (Hope, at p. 1288.) Thus, while the details of uncharged crimes\ncan be proper aggravating factors, in that they illuminate the character and record\nof the capital defendant, the impact of those crimes on the relatives of the actual\nvictims is ―simply too attenuated to be relevant.‖ (Id. at p. 1289.)\n       The Supreme Court of Kentucky reached a similar conclusion in St. Clair v.\nCommonwealth, supra, 451 S.W.3d 597, which found error in the admission of a\nwidow‘s testimony about the impact of an uncharged murder. The court\ndistinguished the widow‘s testimony from the circumstances of the uncharged\nmurder itself and concluded that her testimony was ―a step too far removed to be\nrelevant to sentencing for the crime being tried.‖ (Id. at p. 626.) Because the\nimpact of the uncharged murder was ―not a circumstance‖ of the charged crime nor\n―part of the character of the accused,‖ the admission of her testimony violated the\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fEighth Amendment and deprived the defendant of due process. (St. Clair, at p. 629\n& fn. 19.)\n       And in Cantu v. State (Tex.Crim.App. 1997) 939 S.W.2d 627, the criminal\ncourt of last resort in Texas found error in the admission of testimony about the\nimpact of an uncharged rape and murder on the victim‘s mother. The court held\nthat the mother‘s testimony was not relevant to any matter of consequence in\ndetermining the penalty and that Payne ―does not contemplate admission of such\nevidence as permissible under the Eighth Amendment.‖ (Cantu, at p. 637.)\n       Indeed, as best I can tell, we are now the only jurisdiction in the country to\nexpand the scope of aggravating evidence in a capital trial to this extent. I\nrecognize that California law allows the family and friends of a murder victim to\nexplain, at the penalty phase of the capital trial, what that loss has meant to them,\nso as to provide the jury with a full picture of the harm caused by the defendant ―\n‗as a result of the crime charged.‘ ‖ (Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835.)\nCalifornia law also permits the jury to consider the defendant‘s background and\ncharacter, which can often be conveyed by the defendant‘s use of force or violence\nin other situations. (People v. Nelson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 198, 222-223.) To prove\nthe extent of the defendant‘s force or violence, California law authorizes the jury to\nconsider a range of evidence: not just eyewitness testimony as to the defendant‘s\nacts, but also evidence of the victim‘s suffering — to the extent such evidence\ntends to illuminate how forceful, how violent, or how vicious the defendant‘s acts\nwere. (Cf. People v. Streeter, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 264.) But if we heed our duty\nto ― ‗strike a careful balance‘ ‖ in this area (People v. Murtishaw (2011) 51 Cal.4th\n574, 595), we should also conclude that evidence of the suffering experienced by\nthose who did not witness or experience the defendant‘s use of force or violence is\nsimply not admissible at the penalty phase of a capital trial. Such evidence is\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\frelevant neither to the murder for which the defendant is on trial nor to establish\nhis or her character.\n       The majority cites two cases in which the trial court nonetheless allowed\nrelatives to testify about the effect an uncharged homicide had on their lives. (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 60, citing People v. Johnson (2015) 60 Cal.4th 966, and People v.\nAdams (2014) 60 Cal.4th 541.) In neither instance did the defendant challenge the\nrelevance of the testimony, and we thus had no occasion to offer — and did not\noffer — any justification for its admissibility. (Johnson, at p. 993; Adams, at\np. 573.) The majority likewise fails to support its conclusion that Thompson‘s\ntestimony was relevant to the choice of penalty. I therefore conclude, as did courts\nin every other jurisdiction to consider the question, that its admission was error.\n       I concur in the judgment, though, because I find that the error in the\nadmission of Thompson‘s testimony was harmless. Her testimony about the\nimpact of the murder on her life was quite brief, about two pages in the reporter‘s\ntranscript. The jury instructions did not focus the jury‘s attention on — or even\nmention — the impact of defendant‘s uncharged conduct on surviving relatives.\nFinally, the ultimate impact of Thompson‘s testimony likely paled in comparison\nto the voluminous aggravating evidence that defendant had killed three people in\nseparate incidents, had a substantial record of violent conduct in and out of\ncustody, and had attempted to orchestrate violent attacks even while he was in\ncustody awaiting trial. So I find no reasonable possibility that her testimony\naffected the jury‘s decision to sentence defendant to death, which, after all, was the\nverdict defendant himself had requested. (People v. Enraca (2012) 53 Cal.4th 735,\n765-766.)\n                                                         CUÉLLAR, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nLIU, J.\nKRUGER, J.\n                                          11\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

Ct. No. 07CF2849\n____________________________________)\n\n\n      A jury convicted defendant Billy Joe Johnson of the first degree murder of\nScott Miller (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a)),1 and found true the special\ncircumstance allegations that the murder was committed by means of lying in wait\n(§ 190.2, subd. (a)(15)), and for the benefit of, or at the direction of, and in\nassociation with a criminal street gang (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(22)). The jury also\nconvicted defendant of conspiracy to commit murder (§§ 182, subd. (a)(1), 187,\nsubd. (a)), and as an accessory after the fact (§ 32), and found true a criminal street\ngang enhancement allegation as to all three counts. In connection with the murder\nand conspiracy counts, the jury further found true the allegation that a principal\ndischarged a firearm. After the jury rendered its guilt phase verdicts, the court\nconducted a court trial on the special circumstance allegation that defendant\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n\n\n                          SEE CONCURRING OPINION\n\fpreviously had been convicted of murder (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(2)), and found that\nallegation true. At the conclusion of the penalty phase trial, the jury returned a\nverdict of death. The court denied an automatic motion for modification of the\ndeath verdict to life without the possibility of parole (§ 190.4, subd. (e)), and\nsentenced defendant to death.2 Defendant‘s appeal is automatic. (§ 1239,\nsubd. (b).) For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.\n                                      I. FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase Evidence\n\n           1. Prosecution evidence\n\n                a. Events prior to the murder of Scott Miller\n       Scott ―Scottish‖ Miller was a founding member of an Orange County based\nWhite supremacist street gang called Public Enemy Number 1 (PEN1), which\nformed in the mid 1980s. By the mid to late 1990s, Miller‘s status within the gang\nhad diminished, and he had become marginalized.\n       In February 2001, a local television station aired two news segments about\nPEN1. The segments featured an interview with Miller, who spoke candidly about\nthe gang‘s activities, including its use of violence. Although news producers\nattempted to protect Miller‘s identity by disguising his face and voice, PEN1 gang\nmembers immediately recognized Miller by his tattoos, mannerisms, and the\nobjects around him, including his pit bull.\n\n\n\n2       Before ruling on the automatic motion to modify the verdict, the court\ngranted the prosecution‘s motion under section 1385 to dismiss various prior\nconviction allegations that previously had been bifurcated from the guilt phase of\ntrial but not resolved. The court later stayed, pursuant to section 654, sentence on\nthe conspiracy and accessory convictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f       The news segments were considered bad timing for PEN1, whose two main\nleaders were then being tried on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. As a\nresult of the broadcasts, PEN1 leadership put a ―green light‖ on Miller, marking\nhim for execution. On several occasions during the year that followed, Miller told\nhis girlfriend that he was concerned for his safety. According to one former gang\nmember, however, Miller was still ―running around‖ because no one had the\ncourage to deal with him. Shortly before March 2002, officers in the gang unit at\nthe Costa Mesa Police Department were actively looking for Miller to warn him\nthat they had received credible information that PEN1 members were planning to\nkill him.\n\n               b. The murder of Scott Miller\n       On the evening of March 8, 2002, a little over one year after the news\nsegments about PEN1, defendant‘s cousin hosted a party in Costa Mesa. Several\nmembers and associates of PEN1 attended the party, including Miller and\ndefendant, who had recently transitioned to PEN1 after a falling out with the Nazi\nLow Riders, a White supremacist prison gang. Although defendant had known\nMiller for decades, he had not seen Miller since the news broadcasts had aired.\nAccording to the testimony of a mutual friend who also attended the party, Miller\nand defendant were laughing together and joked about Miller keeping ―his guard\nup.‖\n       Around 10:30 p.m. on the night of the party, Miller‘s now ex-girlfriend\nreceived a voicemail message from him. He sounded concerned. In the\nbackground she heard voices, one of which she recognized as defendant‘s.\nAnother woman who previously had dated Miller saw him when she first arrived\nat the party at 10:00 p.m. But she left the party shortly thereafter to buy drugs and\nby the time she returned around 11:00 p.m., Miller was no longer there.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f       Earlier that day, PEN1 member Michael Lamb had called Christina Hughes\nat her Anaheim apartment. He was looking for Tanya Hinton, a PEN1 associate\nwho was staying there. Hughes told Lamb that Hinton was not at the apartment.\nHe responded, ―It is important, have her call me when she gets home.‖ Hughes\ngave Hinton the message when Hinton arrived at the apartment in the early\nevening, but told Hinton that she did not want any visitors coming to her place.\nShortly before 11:30 p.m., however, Hughes walked downstairs from the upper\nlevel of the two-story apartment and saw Hinton with Lamb and PEN1 member\nJacob Rump on the first floor. Both men had recently been released from prison.\nWhen Hughes demanded that they go, Hinton assured her the group was leaving,\nand Hughes went back upstairs. Minutes later, Hughes heard a single shot fired\noutside in the alley. A neighbor whose home faced the alley also heard a gunshot,\nfollowed by the sound of screeching tires. Sometime between 11:30 and\n11:35 p.m., Hughes and a friend went to the alley to investigate. She saw the dead\nbody of a man she did not recognize and a large amount of blood.\n       Police responded to the scene about 20 to 25 minutes after the shooting, and\nfound Miller‘s body facedown in the alley with blood coming from the head area.\nThere was a bloody baseball cap and soda can underneath Miller‘s head, which\nsuggested he had been surprised by the gunshot and dropped the items where he\nwas shot. In the blood, police found tire impressions that were heading away from\nthe location of the body. They also recovered a nine-millimeter Luger casing on\nthe ground 15 feet from the body.\n       An autopsy showed Miller had died from a single gunshot to the back of his\nhead, which lacerated his cerebellum and cerebrum. According to the forensic\npathologist, Miller probably lost consciousness immediately and death occurred\nwithin minutes. The absence of burning, singeing, stippling, or soot at the\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fentrance wound suggested the barrel of the gun was some distance from the skin,\nnot in contact with it.\n       The day after the shooting, defendant called Miller‘s former girlfriend,\nasking her if she had heard what happened. He told her that ―Scott is no longer\nwith us‖ and something to the effect that if she needed anything, he would be there\nfor her.\n       That same day, defendant spoke with his friend and fellow gang member\nDonald McLachlan about his involvement in Miller‘s death. Defendant told\nMcLachlan that he drove with Miller from the party in Costa Mesa to Anaheim,\ntelling Miller they were going to get drugs. Defendant also indicated that he was\nwalking next to Miller in the alley before he was killed. When Miller heard\nfootsteps coming from behind, he asked defendant, ―Are those PEN1 guys?‖ He\nwas then introduced to Lamb and Rump. According to defendant, Miller seemed\nresigned to the idea that something was going to happen to him.\n       Defendant identified Lamb as the shooter. He also told McLachlan that he\nwas angry and upset about the way the killing was handled and had confronted\nLamb about it. Describing Miller as a ―dear friend,‖ defendant thought Miller\nshould have been executed by a shot to the face, not to the back of the head. As\ndefendant envisioned the scenario, Miller should have been told to his face, ―You\nhad a good run, you ran afoul of the rules, it is time to go.‖ Defendant explained\nthat Miller had to be killed because of the news interview and ―his actions . . . in\nthe neighborhood.‖\n\n                c. The investigation\n       Three days after the shooting, Lamb and Rump were taken into custody\nafter leading police on a high-speed chase in a stolen car and fleeing into an\nAnaheim apartment complex. Just before his arrest, Lamb fired a shot at officers\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\ffrom a second-story balcony, then discarded his weapon by tossing it over the\nrailing into a raised planter. A firearms expert concluded that the cartridge found\nat the scene of Miller‘s death had been fired from the gun Lamb fired at officers.\nThe gun had a capacity for 14 bullets in the magazine and one in the chamber.\nLamb and Rump were charged with murdering Miller, and were jointly tried in\n2007.\n        When a detective had tried to interview defendant in October 2002\nregarding Miller‘s death seven months earlier, defendant said he had nothing to\nsay to him. In 2006, however, defendant contacted Lamb‘s investigator about the\ncrime, telling the investigator that he was the person who shot Miller, and agreeing\nto testify at Lamb and Rump‘s trial that they had nothing to do with the shooting.\nAt the time he contacted Lamb‘s investigator, defendant had just begun serving a\nprison sentence of 45 years to life in an unrelated case.\n        Defendant testified on Lamb‘s behalf at both the guilt and penalty phases of\ntrial. According to defendant, the first time he saw Miller after the news segment\nabout PEN1 was at the party in Costa Mesa, but he had been angry with Miller\nabout the interview and other matters for some time. Between 8:00 and 10:00\np.m., he and Miller left the party in Costa Mesa to buy heroin. During the drive,\ndefendant knew Miller would ―cease to exist‖ before the night was over. After\nstopping briefly at a strip mall so that Miller could use the telephone, they\ncontinued driving into Anaheim, ending up in an alley near an apartment complex.\nDefendant parked his truck and they started walking down the alley. At one point,\nMiller and defendant started to turn left into an opening that led to a walkway to\nthe apartments, with Miller walking a couple of paces ahead of defendant.\nMoments later, defendant grabbed a gun from his waistband and ―blasted him.‖\nDefendant ran back to his truck, which was located about 60 feet from Miller‘s\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fbody. He testified that he saw no other cars in the alley as he was leaving, and that\nhe drove off at a normal speed and returned to the party.\n       Defendant also testified regarding the firearm that was used to kill Miller.\nAccording to defendant, he ran into Lamb in a bar the day after the shooting and\ngave him the weapon, which Lamb said he needed to protect himself against\nMexican gang members. Defendant indicated that the weapon had been in his\npossession for about six months. However, during cross-examination he said he\ndid not know the location of the gun‘s safety, and his answer regarding the number\nof bullets the firearm could hold was incorrect.\n       After testifying at the guilt phase of Lamb and Rump‘s trial in 2007, but\nbefore taking the witness stand at Lamb‘s penalty phase trial in 2008, defendant\nwas charged with Miller‘s murder, for which the prosecution was seeking the\ndeath penalty. Despite the court‘s repeated admonitions regarding his right against\nself-incrimination, defendant continued to maintain that he shot Miller. He told\nLamb‘s penalty phase jury that he lives by his own laws and that he would kill\n―anyone like [Miller] that doesn‘t abide by the rules.‖ Defendant testified more\nspecifically that after seeing Miller‘s interview on the news broadcast, he knew\nMiller was a ―dead man‖ because he was giving up secrets ―to the enemy‖ and\ndivulging information that was detrimental to PEN1.\n\n               d. Other evidence at defendant’s 2009 trial\n       The prosecutor, joined by the lead detective in the Miller shooting, read\naloud to the jury a redacted version of the transcript of defendant‘s prior\ntestimony. The prosecution also called several gang expert witnesses who testified\nregarding defendant‘s past and present gang affiliations, and the history, culture,\nand activities of White supremacist gangs generally and PEN1 in particular.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f       Eric Kraus, an Orange County parole officer who specializes in supervising\nWhite supremacist parolees, was defendant‘s parole officer for about three years,\nbeginning in early 2001. During that time, defendant was a documented associate\nof the Nazi Low Riders.\n       In May 2001, Kraus arrested defendant for a parole violation and he was\nreturned to custody. About one week later, Kraus and Costa Mesa police\nLieutenant Clay Epperson visited defendant in prison at defendant‘s request.\nDefendant informed Kraus that another prisoner had cut him with a razor on the\nback of the neck while they were in the exercise yard. Defendant explained that\nhe had been assaulted for previously refusing to follow a ―green light order‖ to kill\nhis friend and prison cellmate Joseph Govey, but that the recent assault meant he\nwould receive no further discipline for his disobedience. According to Kraus,\nsuch an order would have come from a ―shot caller‖ in either the Aryan\nBrotherhood or the Nazi Low Riders prison gang.\n       During Kraus‘s prison visit, defendant indicated to him that his current\ngang status was with PEN1, ―if anything.‖ Kraus believed that defendant‘s self-\nreport was confirmed by correspondence intercepted by prison officials, in which\ndefendant identified himself as a member of PEN1.\n       Like Kraus, Lieutenant Epperson expressed the view that defendant was a\nmember of PEN1 at the time of Miller‘s death. In forming that opinion, Epperson\npointed to defendant‘s statements during their May 2001 prison visit, his\ntestimony at the Lamb and Rump trial, his prior conviction for dissuading a\nwitness for the benefit of a criminal street gang, recorded telephone calls in which\ndefendant issued orders on behalf of PEN1, and his many PEN1 and White\nsupremacist-themed tattoos.\n       Epperson also provided extensive testimony regarding the history,\nstructure, and culture of White supremacist gangs. He indicated that despite the\n\n                                          8\n\ffact they sport tattoos of Nazi symbols to represent themselves, and are bound\ntogether by racial animus, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hatred, White\nsupremacists are not ideologically driven. They tend to prey on their own\ncommunity with crimes that benefit themselves and the gang, rather than commit\nhate crimes. The gangs are structured hierarchically, and status within the gang is\nearned by the amount of crime and violence the member has carried out to benefit\nthe gang. Criminal successes are therefore boasted about and known to other gang\nmembers. Respect is an important theme in White supremacist gang culture, and\ndisrespect from gang members and nonmembers alike is met with violence. An\nact that is viewed as disrespectful of the gang leadership would require even\ngreater sanctions, including being marked for death. The ―payback‖ for\ndisrespecting gang leaders can occur immediately or days, months, even years,\nlater.\n         Focusing more specifically on PEN1, Epperson described the gang‘s\nhistory and activities. Formed in 1986 by followers of a punk rock band, PEN1\nsoon transitioned into a street and prison gang and grew rapidly to fill a power\nvacuum when the prominence of the Nazi Low Riders began to decline.\nAccording to Epperson, PEN1‘s ―stock in trade‖ is ―self-serving thuggery and\nviolence‖ and the gang often targets law enforcement, prison officials, and\nprosecutors. The gang‘s moneymaking activities include identity theft and drug\ntrafficking, which it carries out with the help of female associates.\n\n             2. Defense evidence\n         The defense called no witnesses or otherwise presented any evidence at the\nguilt phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f       B. Penalty Phase Evidence\n\n           1. Prosecution evidence\n       The prosecution‘s case in aggravation included evidence regarding\ndefendant‘s violent criminal activity both in and out of custody, defendant‘s prior\ncriminal convictions and prison rules violations, recordings of defendant‘s\ntelephone conversations with PEN1 gang members and associates while he was in\ncustody in the Orange County jail, and victim impact testimony.\n\n               a. Violent criminal activity and prior convictions\n\n                     i. Robberies of Virgil Troutman and Catherine Brandolino\n       Four witnesses testified regarding defendant‘s involvement in the April\n1985 residential robbery of Virgil Troutman. According to Troutman, defendant\nand two other men burst into his Costa Mesa home demanding money and drugs\nand assaulting him and his friend. Troutman recognized the three intruders\nbecause they all had grown up together. After being punched in the eye by one of\ndefendant‘s confederates, Troutman and his friend were directed to empty their\npockets. Defendant and the two other robbers took various valuables, including a\ndiamond ring, then left the scene, threatening to kill Troutman and his friend if\nthey called the police. Defendant‘s parole officer testified that defendant\ntelephoned him two days after the robbery, admitting that he had hit Troutman\nduring the incident. On the parole officer‘s advice, defendant turned himself in to\npolice. According to the arresting officer, defendant indicated that he was angry\nwith Troutman for selling cocaine to a young boy. Although Troutman testified\nthat he had previously used cocaine, he denied ever having sold cocaine to anyone,\nincluding a child.\n       In connection with this incident, the prosecution presented evidence that\ndefendant pleaded guilty to grand theft from a person. The prosecution also\npresented evidence showing that, about two years earlier, a jury found defendant\n\n                                         10\n\fguilty of second degree burglary for breaking into and entering a Santa Ana\nresidence with an intent to steal.\n          Three other witnesses testified regarding defendant‘s involvement in a\nrobbery that occurred in April 1989, two years after the Troutman robbery.\nCatherine Schreiner, formerly Catherine Brandolino, told the jury that the incident\noccurred early in the morning as she and a girlfriend were returning to their car in\nthe parking lot of a Denny‘s restaurant. A man approached her girlfriend, then\nher, asking what time it was. After a pickup truck arrived and stopped about 10\nfeet away with its motor idling and passenger door open, the man suddenly\ngrabbed Brandolino‘s purse off her shoulder, jumped into the truck, and shut the\ndoor. Brandolino and her friend yelled at the men and held on to the truck, trying\nto open the door, but they jumped back when the truck took off. Brandolino‘s\nfriend, Linda Nguyen, gave a similar account of the incident.\n          Officer Michael Cacho of the Costa Mesa Police Department testified\nregarding the events that followed the 911 call reporting the purse-snatching\nincident. According to Officer Cacho, Brandolino and Nguyen provided him with\ndescriptions of the robbers, and the license plate number and description of the\ntruck, which was then broadcast to other officers. One of the officers who heard\nthe broadcast located the truck, stopped the vehicle, and detained defendant, who\nwas driving, and his passenger. Brandolino and Nguyen both identified the truck.\nAt an in-field lineup, Nguyen indicated that she had not seen the driver‘s face but\nbelieved the checkered shirt defendant was wearing matched the shirt worn by the\ndriver.\n          The prosecution presented evidence that in connection with this incident\ndefendant pleaded guilty to second degree robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                   ii. The 1991 killing of Folsom State Prison inmate Clyde\n                        Nordeen\n       The prosecution presented extensive evidence regarding defendant‘s\ninvolvement in the April 1991 killing of 56-year-old Clyde Nordeen, who was\nserving a sentence in Folsom State Prison for child molestation. Correctional\nOfficer Marshall Stewart testified that on the day of the incident, he was on duty\nsupervising defendant and about 25 to 30 other inmates who were assigned to a\nwood-cutting job in a Folsom prison work area known as China Hill. As Officer\nStewart explained, inmates assigned to China Hill are dressed in long-sleeved blue\nshirts, usually with a white T-shirt underneath, and they are permitted to use tools\nsuch as pickaxes and shovels. Officer Stewart testified that while conducting a\nperimeter security check around 11:30 a.m. on the day in question, he noticed\nblood along the back side of China Hill‘s fence line. Following the trail of blood\nhe discovered Nordeen‘s badly beaten body in the back corner of a storage shed.\nForensic Pathologist Gregory Reiber testified that Nordeen had suffered severe\nbrain injury and extensive blunt force trauma to his head and face, including\nnumerous lacerations and multiple fractures on his skull and eye sockets. He\nfound no defensive wounds on Nordeen‘s extremities and believed that his death\nwas not instantaneous.\n       Other witnesses testified regarding the investigation into Nordeen‘s killing.\nFor example, a correctional officer documenting the scene at China Hill told the\njury that a short distance from Nordeen‘s body he found a concrete-filled metal\npipe and a wooden pickax handle, both of which had blood on them. He also\ndiscovered other evidence nearby that appeared to be related to the crime,\nincluding another wooden pickax handle and a wooden handle possibly from a\nshovel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f       Evidence of defendant‘s involvement in Nordeen‘s death was presented\nlargely through the testimony of Sergeant Steven Vance, who led the prison‘s\ninvestigation into the incident. Vance related to the jury the information given to\nhim by Ronald Rostamo, one of the inmates assigned to the wood-cutting job on\nChina Hill on the day in question. According to Vance, Rostamo told him that\naround 11:00 a.m., he overheard inmate John Alder say to defendant, ―He‘s not\ndead yet.‖ He then saw Alder pick up a wooden pickax handle and heard him tell\ndefendant there was another one on the ground ―that would work.‖ Rostamo\nwatched as defendant and Alder walked down a pathway toward the rear of the\nstorage shed and disappeared from his view as they passed a small trailer.\nAccording to Rostamo, defendant and Alder reappeared two to three minutes later\nwalking together back along the path and checking each other for bloodstains.\nRostamo further reported that when defendant and Alder returned to the worksite,\ndefendant said to Rostamo, ―Give me your T-shirt, mine has blood on it.‖ Fearful\nof defendant, Rostamo went to the shed with defendant where defendant put on\nRostamo‘s white T-shirt and returned to his work at the wood pile. Rostamo told\nVance finally that defendant and Alder hid their T-shirts underneath a small trailer\nnear the shed. An investigator dispatched to that location found the hidden shirts.\nRostamo‘s account of the T-shirt exchange was further supported by the testimony\nof the correctional officer who conducted body searches of the inmates who\nreturned from China Hill that day. He observed during his search that defendant\nand two other inmates were not wearing their long-sleeved blue shirts.\n       Nordeen‘s killing was referred to the Sacramento County District Attorney\nbut no charges were filed. Prison authorities, however, found defendant guilty of a\nprison rules violation and transferred him to the administrative segregation unit for\n26 months.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                    iii. Recklessly evading a peace officer in 1994\n       Tom Dare, an officer with the Garden Grove Police Department, testified\nregarding an incident in October 1994 involving a driver who led him on a high-\nspeed pursuit in a residential area and eluded arrest by escaping into the backyard\nof a neighborhood home. Officer Dare related that he was patrolling an area\nwhere a number of residential burglaries had recently occurred when he observed\na driver make a quick and erratic turn into a driveway but then remain in the car.\nA check of the vehicle‘s license plate showed the car had recently been\nimpounded and released. As the officer made a U-turn to investigate further, the\ncar exited the driveway and Dare followed. When the car ran a stop sign and Dare\nactivated his overhead lights to conduct a traffic stop, the car accelerated to\nupward of 70 miles per hour, running stop signs and skidding erratically near\nchildren playing in a front yard. The driver then pulled into a driveway, slammed\non the brakes, fled the car, and jumped into the backyard. Officers searched some\nof the backyards in the vicinity but eventually called off the search because the\nresidents in the area tended to be uncooperative with law enforcement and it\nappeared the driver had escaped into one of the homes. When Dare searched the\nabandoned vehicle, he found on the front seat defendant‘s driver‘s license and a\nletter addressed to defendant from the Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation. Dare believed the driver was the same person depicted in the\nphotograph on defendant‘s driver‘s license.\n\n                    iv. The 2004 murder of Cory Lamons\n       During the guilt phase of trial, the jury learned that at the time defendant\ntestified at Lamb and Rump‘s 2007 trial claiming that he was the one who killed\nScott Miller, he recently had begun serving a sentence of 45 years to life. During\nthe penalty phase, the jury was told that that prison term was a third-strike\nsentence imposed after defendant pleaded guilty to second degree murder for the\n\n\n                                          14\n\fApril 2004 killing of Cory Lamons and that, in a bifurcated proceeding following\nits guilt phase verdicts, the court found true a third special circumstance allegation,\nthat defendant was convicted previously of murder, within the meaning of section\n190.2, subdivision (a)(2). The prosecution also presented to the jury the following\nevidence regarding the details of the Lamons murder.\n       Sara Lenard rented a room in the two-story Huntington Beach apartment\nwhere the murder occurred. She testified that around 4:00 p.m. on the day\nLamons was killed, she walked downstairs from her second-floor bedroom to find\nfour people on the first level of the apartment whom she had never seen before.\nDefendant was holding a hammer in his hand and standing with his back against\nthe wall near the door leading to an attached garage. When Lenard asked what\nwas going on, the woman in the group, later identified as defendant‘s girlfriend\nSuzanne Miller, replied, ―This isn‘t going to be good.‖ When Lamons then\nwalked into the apartment through the door leading from the garage, Lenard saw\ndefendant strike Lamons with the hammer. According to Lenard, as defendant\nrepeatedly hit Lamons in the head with the hammer, Lamons was screaming, ―I\ndidn‘t do anything, I didn‘t do anything.‖ Terrified, Lenard ran out the front door.\nShe returned a couple of minutes later after the screaming had stopped. When she\ncame back inside, she saw a lot of blood and Lamons lying motionless on the\nfloor. Lenard left the apartment again, this time with her boyfriend, who had been\nin the bedroom upstairs during the incident. The couple returned to the apartment\nseveral hours later to retrieve their possessions. When they entered, defendant and\nSuzanne Miller were gone and the blood had been cleaned up, but there were two\nmen Lenard did not recognize, who warned her and her boyfriend to ―[k]eep your\nmouth shut or something like this will happen to you.‖\n       Detective Steven Mack testified regarding the circumstances surrounding\nthe discovery of Lamons‘s body and defendant‘s arrest two days after the killing.\n\n                                          15\n\fMack told the jury he was conducting surveillance on a white Ford pickup truck\nbased on information he had received that a group of individuals was trying to\ndispose of a body. At the time the truck was eventually pulled over in Riverside,\ndefendant was at the wheel and Suzanne Miller was in the passenger seat. In the\nbed of the truck was a wood pile covered with carpeting. When Mack detected the\nodor of decomposing flesh and investigated further, he discovered Lamons‘s body\nunderneath the wood. It had been wrapped in dark material that was held together\nwith strips of bedsheet.\n       Detective Mack testified further regarding the condition of Lamons‘s body\nat the time it was discovered in the back of the truck. According to Mack,\nLamons‘s left eye and lips were swollen, and he had visible bruising on the\nforehead, knuckles and upper legs. The parties stipulated that the Orange County\nCoroner‘s Division could not determine the precise cause of death due to the high\nlevel of drugs in Lamons‘s body. The cause of death was therefore listed as ―blunt\nforce head injuries with methamphetamine and amphetamine intoxication.‖\n       Mack also described the evidence obtained during a search of the\nHuntington Beach apartment where Lamons was killed. He told the jury that\nofficers found bleach stains on the carpet leading to the door to the garage, and a\nclaw hammer, the striking portion of which was consistent with the bruise marks\non Lamons‘s body. In the garage, officers found the remnants of a bedsheet that\nmatched the material used to tie the material covering Lamons‘s body.\n       Lamons‘s mother testified briefly, telling the jury that she misses her son\nevery day, and that the worst part for her is knowing that he died a violent death\nbut she was not there to protect him.\n       The prosecutor and the lead detective in the Miller killing then read aloud\nto the jury the transcript of defendant‘s testimony at the Lamb and Rump trial in\nwhich he discussed the Lamons murder. That portion of the prior testimony had\n\n                                         16\n\fbeen redacted during its presentation in the guilt phase of defendant‘s trial for the\nMiller killing. The jury thus heard defendant admit that he beat Lamons to death\nwith his hands and a hammer and then wrapped up his body. When asked why he\nkilled Lamons, defendant replied that Lamons ―had it coming.‖ Specifically,\ndefendant said it was ―gang-type stuff,‖ that Lamons was ―ripping off girls,‖ and\n―being a dope fiend . . . stealing things, taking things, whatever.‖\n\n                    v. Violent conduct while in custody\n       The prosecution presented evidence of numerous incidents involving\ndefendant‘s use of force and violence while in custody.\n       Correctional Officer Mireles testified that in June 1991, she saw defendant\nattack his cellmate at Folsom State Prison. Defendant stood over the inmate\npunching him with closed fists until Mireles could separate them by removing the\ninmate from the cell and closing the door.\n       Correctional Officer Gomez testified that about one year later, in May\n1992, he heard defendant shouting from his cell in the security housing unit at\nCalifornia Corcoran State Prison (Corcoran). When Gomez went to investigate,\nhe observed defendant‘s cellmate seated on his own bunk, with bloodstains on his\nshirt. Defendant admitted hitting his cellmate, claiming that he did so after his\ncellmate said he would ―beat my ass‖ and ―took a swing at me.‖\n       A different officer testified about another incident at Corcoran several\nmonths later in July 1992. Correctional Officer Schuman was in a tower with a\nview of the exercise yard when he observed defendant attack another inmate by\nhitting him on the head and shoulders with clenched fists. The inmate fell\nbackward but defendant continued to hit him in the head, ignoring Schuman‘s\norder to stop fighting. Defendant eventually complied with the order and lay\nprone on the ground after Schuman fired a round from a .37-millimeter gas gun in\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fhis direction. But when defendant and the other inmate resumed fighting,\nSchuman had to discharge the gas gun a second time to bring the situation under\ncontrol.\n       Defendant had been released from custody at one point but was returned to\nprison for a parole violation in early 1995. Correctional Officer Wren testified\nthat in May 1995, he responded to a ―man down‖ report in a housing area for gang\nmembers in the California Institute for Men, Chino (Chino). Wren told the jury\nthat he observed defendant‘s cellmate lying on the cell floor bleeding profusely\nfrom deep cuts in his right shoulder, hand, forearm, chest and thigh. After\nremoving the injured cellmate for medical treatment, Wren returned to the cell and\nobserved that defendant had a laceration on his right hand. According to the\nofficer, such injuries were consistent with the use of a razor blade. The\nprosecution presented evidence that defendant pleaded guilty to assault by a state\nprisoner and received a second-strike sentence of four years to run consecutively\nto his then-current sentence.\n       Correctional Officer Hinojos testified that four months later, in September\n1995, he responded to defendant‘s cell at Chino after another ―man down‖ report.\nAccording to Officer Hinojos, he observed that defendant‘s cellmate had a head\ninjury and defendant had minor abrasions and bleeding on several fingers.\n       In May 1996 defendant was back at Corcoran in the administrative\nsegregation unit. Correctional Officer Smith testified that when he searched the\ncell occupied by defendant and his cellmate, he found on the cellmate‘s side of the\nroom two pieces of weapon-grade metal and, on defendant‘s side, a handmade\nhandcuff key.\n       Correctional Officer Priest testified about an incident at the same prison six\nmonths later, in November 1996. Officer Priest told the jury that he heard a\ncommotion coming from the cell defendant shared with another inmate and\n\n                                         18\n\fobserved defendant standing over his cellmate punching and kicking him in the\nhead and upper torso while the cellmate was on the floor in a fetal position trying\nto protect himself. Priest ordered defendant to stop and exit the cell, but defendant\ncontinued punching and kicking his cellmate until Priest fired a nonlethal rubber\nbaton round at him.\n       Culinary Officer Nava described for the jury defendant‘s conduct during\nthe Chino staff‘s investigation into a homicide that had occurred at that facility in\nJune 2003. As part of the investigation, inmates were being transported from their\ncells to the prison kitchen to be interviewed. Nava told the jury that he observed\ndefendant shout out an order to fellow White inmates not to go to the kitchen for\ninterviews.3 Nava alerted staff to defendant‘s announcement and accompanied\nanother officer to defendant‘s cell to investigate. Defendant told them that no\nWhite inmates would be going to the kitchen. Afterward, no White inmate gave\nan interview.\n\n                    vi. Orchestrating crimes while in custody\n       The prosecution played a number of tape recordings and presented\ntranscripts of defendant‘s monitored telephone calls while in custody in the\nOrange County jail from 2007 until a few weeks before trial in his case in 2009.\nThe recordings were played at various points during testimony by Sheriff‘s\nDeputy Seth Tunstall, who had monitored and recorded the conversations.\n\n\n3      According to Nava, defendant yelled, ―Radio, radio, all wood pile, all wood\npile and comrades. The sergeants are conducting — are taking interviews in the\nkitchen so you will not, I repeat, you will not go into the kitchen. And I mean no\none. And I mean no one. Thank you,‖ to which other inmates responded, ―Thank\nyou.‖ Nava explained to the jury that ―wood pile‖ is a reference to White inmates\nand ―comrades‖ refers to those who are active members of defendant‘s ―set\ngroup.‖\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fTunstall identified for the jury the participants in the telephone calls and their\nrelationship to the PEN1 gang, and he described the individuals and organizations\nreferenced in the calls.\n       In some of the calls, defendant seemed to be coordinating in-custody\nassaults on members of a rival White supremacist gang called the United Society\nof Aryan Skinheads (USAS). For example, in April 2007 defendant spoke with\nRebecca Mangan, who was Lamb‘s girlfriend at the time and an important conduit\nfor defendant‘s communications outside the jail. In that call, Mangan told\ndefendant that a PEN1 gang member named ―Stomper‖ had been stabbed by\nsomeone from USAS while in state prison. Defendant told Mangan that if she\ntalked with PEN1 member ―Half P‖ she should tell him what had happened to\nStomper. He also directed Mangan to ―[t]ell him I said go get one now.‖\nDefendant‘s remarks during the recorded conversation indicated that Half P was in\ncustody in the same prison where defendant had been housed before his transfer to\ncounty jail, and that there were ―four of them,‖ meaning four USAS members that\nhe and Half P had been ―checking on.‖\n       About one year later, in a March 2008 conversation with his friend Andrea\nMetzger, defendant asked her whether she had sent a letter regarding USAS to\nanother PEN1 state prison inmate, ―Patrick,‖ and instructed her to tell him ―to be\non the lookout for them‖ because they have ―jumped . . . three homies in the last\nyear.‖ Defendant told her to have Patrick tell ―anybody and everybody that has\nanything to do with . . . our people . . . .‖ Defendant added, ―Fuck them dudes, . . .\nsmash them all until they fucking go blind.‖ Defendant then told Metzger he\nneeded ―it to go . . . [e]verywhere, all worldwide . . . [that] if you run into one of\nthem fuckers, just smash them, period, no if, ands, or buts about it.‖\n       Other telephone calls suggested that defendant was setting up crimes to be\ncommitted outside prison facilities. For example, in a series of conversations in\n\n                                           20\n\flate May and early June 2007, defendant spoke with PEN1 gang members Jason\nCary and Jason Jones and to Jill Walker, another woman who helped facilitate his\ncommunications outside the jail, regarding what appeared to be a plan for a home\ninvasion robbery. Defendant told Walker to ―grab his scooter‖ and ―anything else\nthat ain‘t nailed down,‖ and to ―take him down‖ and ―divvy it up when they‘re\ndone.‖ When Walker informed defendant that ―the Mexican dudes were gonna\ntake care of it,‖ defendant asked, ―You didn‘t tell ‘em where it was at or anything\ndid ya?‖ She assured him she had not. Defendant then instructed Walker to ―call\nthe homeboy back right now‖ so defendant could ―set up the fucking guidelines.‖\nHe also directed Cary to get in touch with ―the homeboy‖ on a ―secure line,‖\ntelling him that he ―want[ed] to make this thing happen.‖ In a conversation with\nJones, defendant instructed him that ―everything goes,‖ including a $30,000\n―scooter.‖ In a third and final conversation about the apparent plan, defendant told\nCary that defendant‘s brother wants him ―there‖ on Monday. He also expressed\nfrustration, saying he did not ―know why . . . this is so difficult for everybody to\nunderstand.‖ When Cary said it was ―just a matter of getting together,‖ defendant\nprovided him with the names of others who ―should be ready.‖ Defendant then\ncommented that ―evidently somebody needed to hear my voice to . . . tell ‘em . . .\n[to] put the pieces of the puzzle together and fucking make it happen.‖\n       In one of the recorded conversations described above, defendant indicated\nthat he already had a cash buyer for the ―scooter‖ and agreed with Walker that he\nwould split the proceeds from the sale with her. The prosecution also played for\nthe jury a monitored call between defendant and his two brothers in which\ndefendant apparently again sought to profit by putting PEN1 gang members ―to\nwork.‖ In that July 2007 conversation, defendant said he needed to find ―some\njobs.‖ He also said that ―the dudes will go do it . . . [and] . . . [t]hey tell me they‘ll\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fgive me a third, right off the top.‖ Defendant also said he planned to ―throw [the\nmoney] into mom‘s bank account‖ so that he could access it.\n       To bolster the monitored calls evidence, the prosecutor read into the record\nthe portions of defendant‘s testimony at Lamb and Rump‘s earlier trial in which he\nindicated that he still had contact with others outside of jail and that Mangan set\nup his communications with other people. Defendant also admitted in his prior\ntestimony that he ―possibly‖ attempted to set up home invasion robberies while in\njail and ―probably‖ ordered ―a hit‖ on people. The subject of ordering hits arose\nagain, during defendant‘s testimony on his own behalf in the defense case in\nmitigation, when the prosecutor elicited from defendant that he had ―probably‖\ntried more than five times in the past week to arrange for assaults on USAS\nmembers. As defendant explained, he was ―on a mission.‖\n\n                b. Victim impact testimony\n       As evidence in aggravation relating to the circumstances of the capital\ncrime (§ 190.3, factor (a)), the prosecutor called Scott Miller‘s mother, Bonnie\nMiller, to testify about the impact her son‘s death had on her and other family\nmembers. According to Ms. Miller, after the murder, Miller‘s father suffered a\nfatal stroke, his older brother Calvin had to be hospitalized after a breakdown, and\nhis elderly grandmother, with whom Miller was very close, nearly died from a\nheart condition. Ms. Miller testified further that she has fulltime custody of\nMiller‘s son, ―Little Scott,‖ who was born shortly after Miller‘s death. According\nto Ms. Miller, Little Scott does not comprehend why he does not have a father like\nhis friends do, and it broke her heart to tell him he would never see his father. She\ntold the jury it also breaks her heart to take Little Scott to the beach to watch the\nsurfers because she realizes that Miller, who was an avid surfer, will never have a\nchance to teach his son to surf. Ms. Miller concluded her testimony by explaining\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fthat part of her died when her son was murdered and, except for her love for Little\nScott, she has since shut herself off from the rest of the world.\n\n           2. Defense evidence\n       The defense presented a multifaceted case in mitigation that included\ncharacter witnesses, expert testimony regarding defendant‘s social history and\npsychological profile, and testimony by the former warden of San Quentin State\nPrison, who contrasted the day-to-day existence of a death row inmate with that of\nan inmate at a high security prison. Defendant also testified on his own behalf.\n\n               a. Character evidence\n       Two witnesses who had testified during the prosecution‘s case-in-chief at\nthe guilt phase of trial described for the jury a different side of defendant. Shirley\nWilliams testified that she was good friends with defendant and his entire family,\nand that if she was in trouble in any way, defendant was there to help. According\nto Williams, defendant was always courteous to her and respectful and protective\nof women generally. She considered defendant a good father who loved his\nchildren, and she never saw him get violent or enraged; she experienced his\ngentler side only.\n       Another prosecution witness at the guilt phase, Donald McLachlan, told the\njury he considers defendant ―a friend in every definition of the word.‖ He\nexplained that if someone was having problems with a girlfriend or wife, or\nneeded money, defendant would be there. McLachlan also recounted that on one\noccasion, defendant intervened to protect McLachlan‘s possessions when people\nstarted taking things from his residence after he had been taken into custody.\n       Suzanne Miller‘s testimony at the penalty phase reiterated the theme that\nthere were two sides to defendant. Miller, who was defendant‘s girlfriend,\nacknowledged that defendant was capable of great violence. But she described\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fdefendant as loving and respectful, and believed his life had value. Miller also\ncharacterized defendant as very protective, explaining to the jury that defendant\nagreed to a sentence of 45 years to life for Lamons‘s murder so that she and the\nother codefendants in the case could receive determinate sentences rather than life\nterms.\n         Joseph Govey testified about defendant‘s loyalty as a friend. He told the\njury that when he and defendant were cellmates 20 years earlier, defendant\nshowed Govey a letter indicating that an Aryan Brotherhood shot-caller had\nordered defendant to kill him but defendant refused to do so.\n\n                 b. Social history and psychological assessment\n         The defense presented extensive expert testimony by Roberto Flores de\nApodaca, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist. In forming his opinions, Dr. Flores\nconducted two interviews of defendant, administered psychological tests, and\nreviewed various records provided by the defense team.\n         Dr. Flores began his testimony by describing defendant‘s family\nbackground and social development, much of which was reported to him by\ndefendant himself. Defendant‘s parents separated when he was 10 years old and\nhe had had virtually no contact with his father since that time. His father‘s\ndeparture from the family was the point at which defendant started having\nbehavioral problems in school and running afoul of the law. Defendant told\nDr. Flores that he was grateful to his mother for working hard and providing for\nhim and his four older brothers. But Dr. Flores was of the view that defendant‘s\nmother was overwhelmed and unable to adequately exercise any authority over\ndefendant. Defendant reported positive relationships with his four siblings, with\nwhom he spent the bulk of his time. Dr. Flores believed that defendant‘s older\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fbrothers provided him with some parent-like care and guidance, but ultimately\nwere not successful authority figures for him.\n       Notwithstanding defendant‘s description of an ―idyllic‖ childhood and\nadolescence with his siblings, his criminal activities and substance abuse began at\nan early age. Starting with alcohol use at age 10, defendant had moved on to\nmarijuana, LSD, and cocaine by the time he was 14 or 15 years old. By age 25,\nmethamphetamine was defendant‘s ―drug of choice.‖ According to Dr. Flores,\ndefendant‘s alcohol and drug abuse were both a cause and effect of his bad\ndecisions that tended toward criminality, choices he was making on his own\nbecause he had no real authority figure in his life. For example, at age 10,\ndefendant was arrested for receiving stolen property, specifically, some diamond\nearrings that he had sold to buy alcohol. Dr. Flores pointed out that defendant,\nwho was 46 years old at the time of trial, had spent about 25 years of his adult life\nin prison, and he agreed with defense counsel that the prison environment\nprovided defendant with structure and effectual authority figures.\n       Dr. Flores shared with the jury defendant‘s positive comments regarding\nhis two former wives and his two children, 25-year-old Justin and eight-year-old\nRyder. Defendant identified his drug use and lengthy incarcerations as the reasons\nfor the marriage breakups, and he told Dr. Flores that he remained committed to\nhis former wives and his children. Dr. Flores gleaned from these and other\ncomments that although defendant can be violent and vengeful when, in his\njudgment, the situation called for it, he also can be loyal, committed, and helpful\nin other circumstances. In defendant‘s own words, ―The two things that cannot be\nforgiven are [child molesters] and rats, everything else can be forgiven in life.‖\n       Dr. Flores also discussed the results of the intelligence and psychological\ntests he administered to defendant. He determined that defendant‘s intelligence\nquotient on a nonverbal intelligence test was 92, below the average score of 100 in\n\n                                         25\n\fthe general population, but possibly attributable to his having given up on school\nat such an early age. Defendant‘s responses on the personality assessment\ninventory showed that he was prone to drug abuse, aggression, and violence, and\nthat he had no regard for the rights of others, social norms, or the law. That\nassessment further indicated that, with regard to defendant‘s propensity for\naggression, he was irritable and short-tempered, and that he sometimes was unable\nto control his anger. In Dr. Flores‘s view, defendant‘s drug abuse was both the\ncause and effect of this impulsivity. Finally, Dr. Flores described the results of the\nHare psychopathy checklist, a test that quantifies the subject‘s psychopathological\ntendencies associated with a ―basic criminality makeup,‖ which the tester then\ncompares to the scores of inmates in the prison population generally. The\nchecklist showed, among other traits, that defendant was cunning, manipulative,\ncallous, and impulsive, and that he lacked guilt or remorse. Defendant‘s score, 34\nout of 40, placed him in the 97th percentile of the prison population generally. In\nconnection with this assessment, Dr. Flores referred to defendant as a ―principle\npsychopath,‖ meaning that his antisocial, criminal, and violent actions and\nbehaviors are governed by his own internal ethical code, which derives from\nprinciples and values of his gang.\n       Regarding a diagnosis, Dr. Flores concluded that defendant met the criteria\nfor antisocial personality disorder and that he was not amenable to treatment.\n       Defendant informed Dr. Flores during the interviews that he wanted to\nreceive the death penalty. In Dr. Flores‘s view, defendant‘s stated reasons for\npreferring a death verdict — a more desirable quality of life on death row — was\nrational and not impulsive. Dr. Flores also believed that the other option for\ndefendant, which likely would be spending the rest of his life in the security\nhousing unit (SHU) at Pelican Bay State Prison, would not be compatible with his\nmental makeup.\n\n                                         26\n\f               c. Differences between life in a security housing unit and life on\n                   death row\n       Daniel Vasquez, the former warden at San Quentin State Prison, testified\nregarding the differences between the day-to-day life of an inmate placed in the\nSHU at Pelican Bay State Prison and that of a death row inmate at San Quentin.\nAs Vasquez explained, the SHU at Pelican Bay is one of the most secure\ncorrectional facilities in the country, and prisoners who are documented street or\nprison gang members are sometimes placed there indefinitely. Inmates assigned to\nthe SHU are locked in their cells almost 24 hours per day. They are allowed three\ncubic feet of property, including a television or radio. Although inmates in the\nSHU are allowed to exercise by themselves in a small indoor yard and to shower\nabout three times a week, they have no outside visibility or fresh air and are not\npermitted face-to-face contact with visitors or other inmates.\n       Vasquez then described life on death row. According to Vasquez,\ncondemned prisoners in death row‘s most desirable area, called the North Seg, can\nexercise right outside their cell door, and have more time out of their cells than\ninmates in the SHU. Good behavior is a requirement for assignment to North Seg\nand there is a long waiting list. Another area within death row, called East Block,\nis less attractive because the day-to-day existence is mostly repetitive and\nmovement outside the cell is more restrictive. For example, inmates are searched\nand handcuffed when they are escorted to the outdoor exercise yard, which is\ndensely populated with other death row inmates and guarded by armed officers.\nDeath row inmates who exhibit bad or dangerous behavior are housed in the\nadjustment center, where the daily routine is similarly repetitive and restrictive.\nAs Vasquez explained, death row inmates are allowed attorney and family visits\nand, with a record of good behavior, may be permitted face-to-face visits. Death\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\frow inmates also are allowed up to six cubic feet of personal property, depending\non their behavior grade.\n       In response to defense counsel‘s hypothetical question, Vasquez expressed\nhis opinion that it was understandable for a convict with a documented history of\nprison gang affiliations to express a preference for living out his days on death row\nrather than in the SHU in Pelican Bay. As Vasquez pointed out, death row\ninmates have more protection from gang members and enemies and less pressure\nto align with gangs.\n       In response to defense counsel‘s line of questioning regarding misconduct\nby prison guards, Vasquez indicated he was aware of an inquiry by the Federal\nBureau of Investigations into allegations that in the late 1980s and early 1990s\nguards at Corcoran staged fights between inmates and bet on them. According to\nVasquez, the investigation resulted in indictments against some staff.\n       During cross-examination by the prosecutor, Vasquez answered questions\nregarding the records that chronicled defendant‘s 20-year history of incarceration\nin the state‘s prison system. He told the jury that the records showed numerous\ninstances in which defendant was briefly released from prison but returned to\ncustody for violating the conditions of his parole. The prosecutor also elicited\nfrom Vasquez information regarding defendant‘s numerous prison rules violations.\nReading from prison records, Vasquez testified, for example, that during\ndefendant‘s first prison commitment, he was written up five times for rules\nviolations.\n\n               d. Defendant’s testimony\n       Defendant testified on his own behalf, telling the jury he would prefer\nbeing on death row at San Quentin than in the SHU at Pelican Bay. He also spoke\nabout his social history, prison experiences, and gang affiliation, and offered his\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\fown perspectives on Miller‘s murder and the evidence regarding his other crimes\nand acts of violence.\n       Defendant first commented on Miller‘s murder. He said that he felt ―bad‖\nfor Miller‘s mother, but that Miller ―messed up on laws written by us‖ and knew\nthe consequences of his actions. When defense counsel asked defendant whether\nhe had tried to assume more culpability for Miller‘s murder by saying he shot him\nwhen he had not, defendant replied, ―Pretty much.‖ Yet defendant still maintained\nthat he was the shooter and that Lamb and Rump had nothing to do with killing\nMiller. During cross-examination, however, the prosecutor asked defendant to\nexplain why he had to tell Lamb‘s girlfriend to remind Lamb, shortly before\ndefendant testified at Lamb and Rump‘s trial in 2007, how defendant had gotten\nthe murder weapon to him. In connection with that line of questioning, the\nprosecutor played for the jury a tape recording of a monitored call from the\nOrange County jail between defendant and Rebecca Mangan in which Mangan\nsaid ―he,‖ meaning Lamb, needed to know how defendant got ―the bullshit to\nhim.‖ Defendant replied, ―Oh, that, that was, at the fucking, uh, uh,\nMargaritaville,‖ a detail that had been ―fucking hatched a long time ago.‖\n       As he had done during his interviews with Dr. Flores, defendant described\nfor the jury his upbringing, family relationships, and history of drug use. He\nrecalled that as a boy he was involved in all types of sports but did not enjoy\nschool because of the ―authority figure‖ aspect of it. He characterized his father as\na strict disciplinarian who would punish him harshly for showing disrespect, but\nspoke about his fondness for his mother and his two former wives, and his love for\nhis own children. Defendant told the jury that he always had maintained good\ncontact with his older son Justin, even during lengthy incarcerations. He\nacknowledged that his prison time and drug use had ruined his marriages, and\nreflected that had he never used drugs he probably would have lived a crime-free\n\n                                         29\n\flife. But defendant also admitted that he ―still love[s] drugs‖ and ―will do drugs‖\nuntil he dies.\n       Defendant testified that he had grown up through the prison system, and he\nbelieved the decades he spent in that environment had produced his violent side.\nAccording to defendant, prison is a ―kill or be killed‖ situation, and ―everybody\ncan get got, no matter how big you are, how small you are, the bodies hit the\nfloor.‖ Defendant indicated that he himself almost had been killed when he was\nstabbed in the neck for disobeying a shot-caller‘s order to kill his cellmate Joseph\nGovey.\n       Defendant also testified regarding his involvement in White supremacist\ngangs. He explained that he did not join a gang during his first incarceration\nbecause at that time he was ―too young, too naïve to see that my race needed\nhelp.‖ He eventually aligned himself with a White supremacist gang because he\nwanted to help the older and younger inmates who were being preyed upon.\nDefendant indicated that he ―lives‖ for his race, but has no problem with other\nraces ―unless they come into my area‖ selling drugs or burglarizing homes. He\ndoes not want ―people harassing my people‖ and would do ―everything feasibly\npossible to make sure that they leave the neighborhood,‖ including killing them,\n―if that‘s what it takes.‖ Defendant emphasized that he had never been convicted\nof a hate crime and had never beat up someone because of his race.\n       Defendant then offered the jury his explanations for some of the crimes and\nacts of violence that were described during the prosecution‘s case in aggravation.\nWith regard to the killing of Folsom prison inmate Clyde Nordeen, defendant\nguessed that the reason no charges were filed against him was because Nordeen\nwas a child molester. Defendant did not like it that Nordeen got ―a little two-year\nsentence‖ for raping children. As for the various assaults on his Folsom prison\ncellmates, defendant explained that the prison had placed known informants in his\n\n                                         30\n\fcell in an attempt to get him to talk about the fatal attack on Nordeen. Defendant\nalso offered his reasons for assaulting fellow inmates in Corcoran. For example,\nhe asserted that a September 1995 attack on an African-American inmate took\nplace in a ―gladiator arena.‖ According to defendant, one of the guards asked if\ndefendant minded him taking home the security camera recording of the exercise-\nyard fight, so that he could show his children the proper way to ―beat somebody‘s\nass.‖ Defendant admitted that in November 1996 he assaulted an inmate who had\ndropped out of one of the gangs. As defendant put it, he ―did what I had to do.‖\n       Defendant did not deny having engaged in numerous crimes and acts of\nviolence both inside and outside the custodial setting, including two homicides\nthat were not part of the prosecution‘s case in aggravation. He pointed out,\nhowever, that he always directed his violence toward drug dealers, addicts,\ngangsters, and convicts, and never against law enforcement. In defendant‘s words,\n―My actions have hurt people. I am sorry about that, but you know, the people\nthat I hurt knew the job was tough when they took it. They signed onto the same\nthing that I signed onto.‖ In this regard, defendant admitted the 1985 burglary of\nVirgil Troutman‘s home, which he described as a drug house. As defendant\nexplained, Troutman was a drug dealer who refused to front defendant some\ndrugs; defendant also had heard Troutman sold drugs to children, which bothered\nhim. Defendant used a similar theme when discussing his involvement in Cory\nLamons‘s murder, explaining that Lamons was a drug addict who owed defendant\nmoney and was stealing from women he knew.\n       Defendant minimized or flatly denied his involvement in other incidents\npresented in the prosecution‘s penalty phase case, however. Specifically,\ndefendant indicated that he did not know that his ―jackass‖ friend was going to\nsteal a woman‘s purse in April 1989, and he claimed he was high on cocaine and\nalcohol when that crime occurred. Defendant also insisted that he had never run\n\n                                        31\n\ffrom the police and was not the person who evaded Garden Grove officers in a\nhigh-speed chase in October 1994. He explained that he co-owned the car, which\nhad been impounded, but maintained that ―Alex‖ had retrieved the car and then\nrun from police because he was carrying a pound of marijuana.\n       Defense counsel‘s direct examination of defendant ended as it had begun,\nby eliciting from defendant that his goal was to get the best situation for himself\nand he therefore preferred to live out the rest of his life on death row.\n                                   II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Guilt Phase Claims\n\n           1. Sufficiency of the evidence of lying in wait\n       The prosecution presented alternative theories of defendant‘s first degree\nmurder liability for Miller‘s death: (1) that the killing was premeditated and\ndeliberated murder, or (2) that it was committed by means of lying in wait.\n(§ 189.) The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. The jury also\nfound true the associated lying-in-wait special-circumstance allegation. (§ 190.2,\nsubd. (a)(15).) Defendant asserts that his murder conviction based on lying in wait\nand the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding were not supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and therefore cannot stand. Under the applicable standard\nfor assessing his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence (People v. Booker\n(2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172; People v.

A lying-\nin-wait special circumstance can apply to a defendant who, intending that the\nvictim would be killed, aids and abets an intentional murder committed by means\nof lying in wait. (§ 190.2, subds. (a)(15), (c); People v. Bonilla (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571564\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571564/people-v-bonilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331-332 [relying on identical language in § 190.2, former subd. (b) as the\nstatutory basis for an aider and abettor‘s liability].) In this factual setting, the\nquestions are whether the defendant, with the intent to kill, aided and abetted the\nvictim‘s killing, and whether the actual killer intentionally killed the victim by\nmeans of lying in wait. (People v. Bonilla, supra, at p. 331.)\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts as we must\n(People v. Johnson, supra, 26 Cal.3d at p. 576), we conclude that all of the\nrequirements for the lying-in-wait special circumstance were established in this\ncase. From defendant‘s statements to fellow gang member McLachlan the day\nafter the shooting, the jury reasonably could infer that defendant harbored an\nintent to kill when he aided and abetted Miller‘s killing. Defendant told\n\n                                           33\n\fMcLachlan that Miller had to be killed because of his news interview and his\nactions ―in the neighborhood.‖ Defendant had elaborated on the first point during\nhis testimony at Lamb and Rump‘s trial, saying that he had been angry at Miller\nfor some time for agreeing to be interviewed for the television news segment and\nthat he would kill anyone like Miller who did not abide by the rules. Defendant\nalso characterized Miller as a ―dead man‖ for giving up the gang‘s secrets ―to the\nenemy.‖\n       The record also contains ample evidence that defendant aided and abetted\nthe killing. ―[A] person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she,\nacting with (1) knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator; and (2) the\nintent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the\noffense, (3) by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages, or instigates, the\ncommission of the crime.‖ (People v. Beeman (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561; accord,\nPeople v.

A day after the killing, defendant described for\nMcLachlan his involvement in Miller‘s death. He told McLachlan that he drove\nwith Miller from Costa Mesa to Anaheim with the pretense of obtaining drugs. He\nalso said that he walked next to Miller in the alley right before Miller was killed.\nDefendant told McLachlan that after hearing the sound of footsteps behind them,\nMiller turned to defendant and asked, ―Are those PEN1 guys?‖ and was\n―introduced‖ to Lamb and Rump. Defendant also recounted having yelled at\nLamb for shooting Miller from behind, telling McLachlan he believed Miller\nshould have been shot in the face so that they could have confronted him about\n\n                                         34\n\frunning afoul of the rules. From this evidence, the jury reasonably could infer that\ndefendant aided and abetted Miller‘s killing.\n       The evidence further established that the actual killers intentionally killed\nMiller by means of lying in wait within the meaning of section 190.2,\nsubdivision (a)(15). The record reflects that all of the elements of the special\ncircumstance were satisfied. The autopsy showed that Miller was killed by a\nsingle shot to the back of the head, from which it could be inferred that he was\nkilled intentionally. (See People v. Burney (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590272\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590272/people-v-burney/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243.) The\nevidence also showed that defendant drove with Miller to Anaheim on the pretext\nof buying drugs, leading him to a deserted alleyway where Lamb and Rump were\nwaiting for them. When defendant and Miller got halfway down the alley, Lamb\nand Rump approached them from behind. Moments later, and from that position\nof advantage, Lamb shot Miller in the back of the head.\n       We have characterized similar evidence as a ―classic lying-in-wait special-\ncircumstance murder.‖ (People v. Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 332, fn. 6.) In\nBonilla, the defendant drove the victim, a San Francisco entrepreneur, to a vacant\noffice park at night purportedly to meet with a commercial real estate agent.\nWaiting for them at that location were the defendant‘s two confederates, one of\nwhom was posing as a commercial real estate agent and the other a security guard.\nAs the four men stood together in the parking lot, the confederates suddenly set\nupon the victim and threw him into the back of defendant‘s truck, where they\nwrapped his head in duct tape until he suffocated. (Id. at pp. 321-322.)\n       Defendant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence of intent to kill,\nor the sufficiency of the evidence of watching and waiting for an opportune time\nto act. He argues, however, that there is no substantial evidence of concealment of\npurpose.\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f       With regard to the element of concealment, we have explained that physical\nconcealment before the attack on the victim is not required. Rather, ― ‗[i]t is\nsufficient that a defendant‘s true intent and purpose were concealed by his actions\nor conduct.‘ ‖ (People v. Morales, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 555.) The concealment,\nin that sense, ― ‗is that which puts the defendant in a position of advantage, from\nwhich the factfinder can infer that lying-in-wait was part of the defendant‘s plan to\ntake the victim by surprise.‘ ‖ (Ibid.)\n       Defendant contends that what is lacking in the record is evidence of the\nrequired nexus between concealment of purpose and a surprise attack from a\nposition of advantage. With regard to concealment, defendant argues that\nalthough defendant may have used the promise of a drug purchase to entice Miller\nto leave with him, Miller clearly knew defendant‘s real purpose. According to\ndefendant, Miller was aware of the potential consequences of having been\ninterviewed for the news report on PEN1 and was on his guard. Specifically, in\nthe year following the news report, Miller had told his former girlfriend on several\noccasions that he was concerned for his safety. At the party in Costa Mesa on the\nnight of the shooting, Miller and defendant joked with one another about Miller\nkeeping his guard up. And sometime later that evening, Miller left his former\ngirlfriend a concerned-sounding voicemail message — with defendant‘s voice\npossibly in the background. Furthermore, according to defendant, he had testified\nat Lamb and Rump‘s trial that he told Miller at the party that he was going to kill\nhim. Defendant argues that the only reasonable inferences that could be drawn\nfrom this evidence was that Miller knew his gang wanted him killed and that he\nwas concerned he would be killed that night because he was out with defendant.\nIn defendant‘s view, the evidence did not show concealment of purpose but rather\nthat Miller, a drug addict, made a bad choice to go with defendant to get drugs.\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\f       We reject defendant‘s assertion that the record lacks substantial evidence of\nconcealment of purpose. Defendant‘s summary of the facts ignores the gang\nexpert‘s testimony to the effect that punishment for violating gang rules could be\nextracted years after the offending act, and McLachlan‘s remark that Miller was\n―still running around‖ because no one had the courage to carry out the gang\nleadership‘s order to kill him. This evidence suggested that although Miller may\nhave been aware there would be consequences for participating in the news\ninterview, and may have voiced safety concerns on several occasions during the\nyear following the news broadcast and on the night of the shooting, he did not\nnecessarily expect that the execution would occur when he left the party with\ndefendant to obtain drugs. (See People v. Arellano (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248978\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248978/people-v-arellano/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Defendant emphasizes his\nstatement to McLachlan that when he and Miller walked together in the alley and\nheard the sound of footsteps behind them, Miller asked, ―Are those ―PEN1 guys?‖\nand was ―introduced‖ to Lamb and Rump. Contrary to defendant‘s assertion,\nhowever, Miller‘s awareness of Lamb and Rump‘s presence does not defeat the\ninference that defendant‘s concealment of purpose put his fellow gang members in\na position of advantage by which to take Miller by surprise.

That the\nshooting occurred shortly after Miller became aware of Lamb and Rump‘s\npresence may be inferred from Hughes‘s testimony that she heard a gunshot in the\nalley only minutes after Lamb and Rump left her apartment. A surprise attack\nfrom a position of advantage also could be inferred from the evidence that Miller‘s\nbaseball cap and soda can were found underneath his face on the pavement, which\nsuggested he had been caught off guard and dropped these objects at the time he\nwas shot. Defendant argues that the evidence Miller was shot in the back of the\nhead after Lamb and Rump joined up with them showed only that Miller was\nresigned to being killed. Although McLachlan‘s testimony relating defendant‘s\naccount of the killing raised the possibility that Miller was resigned to his fate, the\njury was not obligated to accept defendant‘s assessment of Miller‘s state of mind\nat the time of the shooting. We conclude the record contains sufficient evidence\nfrom which a rational jury could infer a surprise attack from a position of\nadvantage.\n       Defendant‘s challenge to his murder conviction based on lying in wait also\nfails. We have concluded that the lying-in-wait special circumstance under former\nsection 190.2, subdivision (a)(15) is ― ‗ ―slightly different‖ ‘ ‖ from, and its\nelements are ― ‗more stringent‘ ‖ than, lying-in-wait first degree murder under\nsection 189. (People v. Moon, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 22; see People v. Webster,\nsupra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 448 [the lying-in-wait special circumstance requires a\nfinding of intent to kill but lying-in-wait murder requires only a ―wanton and\nreckless intent to inflict injury likely to cause death‖].)

Here, sufficient evidence supports the conclusion that, with the\nintent that Miller would die, defendant aided and abetted an intentional murder\ncommitted by lying in wait. Because sufficient evidence supports the lying-in-\nwait special-circumstance finding, it necessarily supports the first degree murder\nverdict based on the theory of lying in wait. (Cf. People v. Moon, supra, at p. 22.)\n\n           2. Constitutionality of the lying-in-wait special circumstance\n       Defendant argues that the lying-in-wait special-circumstance finding must\nbe vacated, and his death sentence reversed, because the special circumstance is\nvirtually identical to, and thus indistinguishable from, the lying-in-wait theory of\nfirst degree murder and, therefore, fails to satisfy the requirements of the Eighth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution.\n       Miller‘s murder occurred in 2002. As defendant correctly points out, in\nMarch 2000, the voters passed Proposition 18, which changed the definition of the\nlying-in-wait special circumstance from a killing while lying in wait to a killing\nby means of lying-in-wait, mirroring the language of the first degree murder\nstatute. (See Stats. 1998, ch. 629, § 2, p. 4163, enacted as Prop. 18, approved by\nvoters, Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) eff. Mar. 8, 2000.) He argues that the\namendment rendered the special circumstance virtually identical to first degree\nlying-in-wait murder and thereby eliminated the guidance needed to prevent its\narbitrary and capricious application in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n       Recent decisions by this court have noted the change to section 190.2,\nsubdivision (a)(15). (See, e.g., People v.

The\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit a sentence of death ―imposed under\nsentencing procedures that create a substantial risk that the punishment will be\ninflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.‖ (Godfrey v. Georgia (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110259\"><a href=\"/opinion/110259/godfrey-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427.) To satisfy this constitutional command, ―the trier of fact must\nconvict the defendant of murder and find one ‗aggravating circumstance‘ (or its\nequivalent) at either the guilt or penalty phase. . . . [T]he aggravating\ncircumstance must meet two requirements. First, the circumstance may not apply\nto every defendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of\ndefendants convicted of murder. [Citation.] Second, the aggravating\ncircumstance may not be unconstitutionally vague.‖ (Tuilaepa v.

The lying-in-wait special circumstance is an\n―aggravating circumstance[ ]‖ subject to these constitutional requirements.\n(People v.

Superior Court (Bradway) (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2283670\"><a href=\"/opinion/2283670/people-v-superior-court-bradway/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The\nCourt of Appeal determined that by passing Proposition 18, which changed the\nspecial circumstance‘s former reference to a killing ― ‗while‘ ‖ lying in wait to a\nkilling ― ‗by means of‘ ‖ lying in wait, the voters intended to conform the temporal\nconnection between the killing and the lying in wait required for the special\ncircumstance to that required for lying-in-wait first degree murder. (Bradway, at\n\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fpp. 307-308.) It also determined that the amended special circumstance was not\nunconstitutionally vague as applied to Bradway. 4 (Bradway, at pp. 309-311.)\n       We agree with Bradway that the voters‘ adoption of the ―by means of‖\nlying-in-wait language mirroring section 189‘s definition of lying-in-wait murder\nevidenced an intention to align the special circumstance with lying-in-wait first\ndegree murder in one of the respects that previously had distinguished the two.\nThat conclusion is further supported by the election materials associated with the\npassage of Proposition 18, as Bradway observed. (Bradway, supra, 105\nCal.App.4th at pp. 307-308.) The voter information pamphlet shows that voters\nwere informed that the courts had interpreted the special circumstance‘s reference\nto a killing ―while‖ lying in wait to require that the murder have ―occurred\nimmediately upon a confrontation between the murderer and the victim.‖\nAccording to the Legislative Analyst, this interpretation precluded application of\nthe special circumstance if the defendant watched and waited for the victim, but\nthe killing occurred after the defendant had captured the victim and transported\nhim or her to another location. (Voter Information Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7,\n2000) Legis. Analyst‘s analysis of Prop. 18, p. 33.) The Legislative Analyst\nexplained that the passage of Proposition 18 would replace the special\ncircumstance‘s previous language with reference to a killing ―by means of‖ lying\n\n\n\n4       Because Bradway was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole,\nrather than death, his constitutional challenge to the lying-in-wait special\ncircumstance arose as a void-for-vagueness claim under the due process clause.\n(Bradway, supra, 105 Cal.App.4th at p. 309.) However, his vagueness challenge\nechoed the ―specialized concept of vagueness most clearly defined by the [United\nStates] Supreme Court in dealing with Eighth Amendment challenges to death\npenalties.‖ (Bradway v. Cate (9th Cir. 2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1310866\"><a href=\"/opinion/1310866/bradway-v-cate/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\fin wait, thereby permitting application of the special circumstance in that\npreviously prohibited scenario. (Ibid.; see Bradway, supra, at p. 308.)\n       Having determined that the voters‘ purpose in amending the lying-in-wait\nspecial circumstance was to eliminate the temporal distinction between the special\ncircumstance and lying-in-wait first degree murder, and thereby expand the class\nof cases in which the special circumstance could be found true, the question\nremains whether the special circumstance provision still adequately distinguishes\nitself from other murders and does so in terms that are not so vague as to permit\narbitrary determinations regarding the truth of the special circumstance allegation.\n(Tuilaepa v. California, supra, 512 U.S. at pp. 971-972.) For the reasons\nexplained below, we conclude that the amended lying-in-wait special circumstance\nsatisfies the Eighth Amendment in both respects.\n       People v.

In rejecting that\nchallenge, we observed in relevant part that murder by poison is particularly\nreprehensible: The murderer acts surreptitiously and thereby prevents the victim\nany chance at self-defense. (Id. at p. 159.) Like the murderer who poisons his\nvictim, the murderer who kills by lying in wait acts surreptitiously, concealing\nhimself or his purpose and making a surprise attack on his victim from a position\nof advantage, thereby denying the victim any chance of escape, aid, or self-\ndefense. It is no surprise that a murder committed by lying in wait historically has\nbeen viewed as ― ‗a particularly heinous and repugnant crime.‘ ‖ (People v.\nEdelbacher (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1349539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1349539/people-v-edelbacher/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023.)

Specifically, he asserts that because his liability for lying-in-\nwait first degree murder as an aider and abettor required a showing of intent to\nkill, there was no meaningful distinction between that theory of first degree\nmurder and the lying-in-wait special circumstance in his case, making it\nunnecessary for the jury to consider any additional information when deciding the\ntruth of the special circumstance allegation and rendering a true finding inevitable.\nDefendant‘s as-applied challenge is essentially the same argument as his facial\nattack, which we have rejected for the reasons discussed above. (See People v.\nLewis (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517.) The lying-in-wait special circumstance\nallegation that applied in this case, like its predecessor, ―is limited to intentional\nmurders that involve a concealment of purpose and a meaningful period of\nwatching and waiting for an opportune time to attack, followed by a surprise lethal\nattack on an unsuspecting victim from a position of advantage.‖ (People v.

Here, the jury‘s finding was based on evidence\nthat defendant‘s actions satisfied the lying-in-wait special circumstance. With the\nintent that Miller would be killed, defendant drove with him to Anaheim on the\npretext of buying drugs, and led him into an alley where Lamb and Rump were\nwaiting to execute him. When defendant and Miller got halfway down the alley,\nLamb and Rump approached from behind and, from that position of advantage,\nLamb carried out a surprise attack by shooting Miller in the back of the head. The\napplication of the lying-in-wait special circumstance to such a scenario does not\noffend the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\f           3. Instruction that an aider and abettor and the direct perpetrator are\n               “equally guilty”\n       As previously mentioned, the prosecutor‘s theory of the case was that\ndefendant aided and abetted the murder of Scott Miller by luring him to a deserted\nalley where Lamb executed him with a shot to the back of the head. In connection\nwith that theory, the trial court instructed the jury on the principles of aider and\nabettor liability, introducing the theory with former CALCRIM No. 400. As the\ninstruction read at the time of defendant‘s trial, the court stated as follows. ―A\nperson may be guilty of a crime in two ways. One, he may have directly\ncommitted the crime. I will call that person the perpetrator. Two, he may have\naided and abetted the perpetrator, who directly committed the crime. A person is\nequally guilty of the crime whether he committed it personally or aided and\nabetted the perpetrator who committed it.‖ (See CALCRIM No. 400 (Aug. 2009),\nitalics added.)\n       Focusing on the ―equally guilty‖ language italicized above, defendant\nargues that instructing with former CALCRIM No. 400 violated his right to due\nprocess because the instruction misdescribed the prosecution‘s burden of proving\nhis liability as an aider and abettor and permitted the jury to convict him of first\ndegree murder based on the culpability of the perpetrator Lamb, without\nconsidering his own mental state. As defendant points out, an aider and abettor‘s\ncriminal liability may sometimes be greater than, or lesser than, that of the\nperpetrator. But, he argues, if the jurors concluded that Lamb premeditated and\ndeliberated the murder, they were ―duty bound‖ under former CALCRIM No. 400\nto find defendant guilty of first degree murder, even if they believed defendant did\nnot harbor the requisite mental state for first degree murder.\n       As a threshold matter, the Attorney General asserts that defendant‘s claim\nof instructional error was not preserved for appeal because defense counsel neither\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\fobjected to, nor sought modification of, former CALCRIM No. 400 at trial.

Here, defendant\ncontends that instructing the jury with the ―equally guilty‖ language in former\nCALCRIM No. 400 violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess because it allowed the jury to convict him of first degree murder based on\nthe mental state of the perpetrator, without considering defendant‘s own mental\nstate.

In McCoy, this court rejected the notion that an\naider and abettor cannot be found guilty of a greater offense than that committed\nby the perpetrator. As we observed, aider and abettor liability for a killing is\nbased on the combined acts of all the principals and the aider and abettor‘s own\nmental state, which ― ‗ ―float[s] free‖ ‘ ‖ from the mental state of the perpetrator.\n(Id. at p. 1119.) When the aider and abettor‘s mental state is more culpable than\nthat of the actual perpetrator, the aider and abettor may be guilty of a more serious\ncrime. (Id. at p. 1120.)\n       In People v.

(Samaniego, supra, at pp. 1163-1164; Nero, supra, at pp. 513-517.)\nAlthough the Court of Appeal in Samaniego found that former CALCRIM\nNo. 400‘s reference to principals being ― ‗equally guilty‘ ‖ of a crime was a\ngenerally correct statement of the law, it concluded that the instruction was\nmisleading in light of the unique facts of that case, in which three defendants were\nconvicted of two counts of first degree murder but the evidence did not establish\nwhich of the three defendants was the actual perpetrator. (People v. Samaniego,\nsupra, at pp. 1162, 1165.) The Court of Appeal in Nero concluded, however, that\nformer CALJIC No. 3.00, the instruction similar to former CALCRIM No. 400,\nwas confusing even in unexceptional cases, and recommended that it be modified.\n(People v. Nero, supra, at p. 518.)

As explained below, the jury would not have been misled\nin this respect in the present matter.\n       First, there was no version of the evidence in this case suggesting that\ndefendant‘s mental state was less culpable than that of the actual killer.\nDefendant‘s statements to McLachlan detailing his significant involvement in the\nkilling — including his description of having used the pretext of a drug purchase\n\n5      In relevant part, CALCRIM No. 400 now reads as follows. ―A person may\nbe guilty of a crime in two ways. One, he or she may have directly committed the\ncrime. I will call that person the perpetrator. Two, he or she may have aided and\nabetted a perpetrator, who directly committed the crime. [¶] A person is guilty of\na crime whether he or she committed it personally or aided and abetted the\nperpetrator.‖ (See Judicial Council of Cal., Crim. Jury Instns. (Apr. 2010 supp.)\nBench Notes to CALCRIM No. 400, p. 28.)\n       Former CALJIC No. 3.00 likewise was modified in 2010, making the\n―equally guilty‖ language optional. That instruction now states in relevant part,\n―Persons who are involved in [committing] [or] [attempting to commit] a crime\nare referred to as principals in that crime. Each principal, regardless of the extent\nor manner of participation is [equally guilty.] [guilty of a crime.]‖ The use note\nindicates that in cases presenting the issue whether the aider and abettor‘s mens\nrea suggests his or her guilt may be greater or lesser than that of the actual\nperpetrator, the court should instruct with the ―guilty of a crime‖ language instead\nof ―equally guilty.‖ (Use Note to CALJIC No. 3.00 (Spring 2010 rev.).)\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fto lure Miller to the alley where Lamb and Rump were waiting, and later having\nhad words with Lamb for shooting Miller from behind rather than confronting him\nabout his transgressions face to face before killing him — left little question that\ndefendant ―share[d] the murderous intent of the actual perpetrator.‖ (People v.\nMcCoy, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1118.)\n       Nor was there anything in the record suggesting that the jurors may have\nbelieved the ―equally guilty‖ language in former CALCRIM No. 400 required\nthem to determine defendant‘s criminal liability based on Lamb‘s mental state at\nthe time of the killing, rather than considering defendant‘s own mental state. The\ncourt introduced the subject of aider and abettor liability by reading former\nCALCRIM No. 400. It then instructed the jury with CALCRIM No. 401, which\nsets out the requirements for establishing aider and abettor liability. The jury\ntherefore was informed that for them to find defendant guilty of murder as an aider\nand abettor the prosecution must prove that defendant knew Lamb intended to kill\nMiller, that he intended to aid and abet Lamb in committing the killing, and that he\ndid in fact aid him in that killing, which would have cleared up any ambiguity\narguably presented by former CALCRIM No. 400‘s reference to principals being\n―equally guilty.‖ This is not a case like People v. Nero, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255969\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255969/people-v-nero/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Prior-murder special circumstance finding based on a murder that\n               occurred after the capital offense\n       After the jury returned its verdicts in the guilt phase of trial, the trial court\nconducted a court trial on the special circumstance allegation that defendant ―was\nconvicted previously of murder in the first or second degree‖ (§ 190.2,\nsubd. (a)(2)), and found the allegation to be true. The victim of that murder was\nCory Lamons, who was killed in April 2004. In June 2004, defendant pleaded\nguilty to second degree murder for his involvement in that crime.\n       Pointing out that the murder of Cory Lamons occurred two years after the\nmurder of Scott Miller in March 2002, defendant argues that the prior-murder\nspecial circumstance finding should be vacated because, contrary to federal\nconstitutional requirements, he was not on notice at the time of the Miller murder\nthat he was subjecting himself to death eligibility for a prior murder conviction.\nDefendant also complains that the prior-murder special circumstance allegation, as\napplied to him, is vague and overbroad and bears no relationship to the capital\nmurder itself, in violation of Eighth Amendment commands.\n       We observe that section 190.2, subdivision (a)(2), was in effect at the time\nof Miller‘s murder. This court long ago explained that ―[t]he unambiguous\nlanguage and purpose of section 190.2(a)(2) . . . require that a person such as\ndefendant, already convicted of murder in a prior proceeding, must be considered\neligible for the death penalty if convicted of first degree murder in a subsequent\ntrial.

Penalty Phase Claims\n\n           1. Victim impact testimony relating to a murder other than the capital\n               crime\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to\npresent victim impact evidence relating to noncapital crimes, including the\nnoncapital murder of Cory Lamons. He argues that such evidence is inadmissible\nas a factor in aggravation under state law and that its admission violated his rights\nto due process, trial before an impartial jury, and a reliable penalty determination\nguaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their state\nconstitutional counterparts. We conclude to the contrary that there was no\nstatutory or constitutional bar to admitting the evidence in question.\n\n               a. Background\n       The court, sitting as trier of fact in a bifurcated guilt phase proceeding to\ndetermine the truth of the prior-murder special-circumstance allegation, found\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that defendant previously had been convicted of the\nsecond degree murder of Cory Lamons. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(2).) At the penalty\nphase of trial, the court informed the jury of its finding and the prosecutor called\nseveral witnesses to testify regarding the circumstances of that crime as evidence\nof ―other violent criminal activity‖ pursuant to section 190.3, factor (b).\n       Prior to trial, the prosecutor had filed a written motion seeking admission of\nvictim impact testimony relating to defendant‘s ―other violent criminal activity‖\ngenerally. The defense filed a written response objecting to the presentation of\nsuch evidence generally, and arguing in part that even if victim impact evidence is\n\n                                          51\n\fpermitted under section 190.3, factor (b) (factor (b)), its admission should be\nlimited to testimony by the actual victim of the crime, and that testimony by\nrelatives does not fall within the scope of factor (b) evidence. At a pretrial hearing\non the motion, the prosecutor asserted that the defense position allowing victim\nimpact testimony relating to factor (b) crimes if the victim survived but not if the\nvictim died is a distinction not contemplated in the relevant case law. He argued\nthat, with regard to the Lamons murder, for example, it would be proper to call the\nvictim‘s mother to testify about the impact of that crime. Defense counsel\nsubmitted the issue based on his written motion objecting to the factor (b) victim\nimpact testimony generally. With regard to testimony by Lamons‘s mother\nspecifically, counsel added that the crime of murder speaks for itself and the\nfinality of murder is so obvious that the jury does not need a witness to testify\nabout it. The court concluded that the case law supported admission of testimony\nby Lamons‘s mother and overruled the defense objection without prejudice to\ncounsel‘s raising other objections to that evidence later in the proceedings.\n       With no further objections by defense counsel, the prosecutor called several\nwitnesses to testify regarding Lamons‘s murder. Cory Lamons‘s mother, Sharon\nThompson, was the last of these witnesses. During her testimony, she described\nhow life changed for her and Lamons‘s older sister after her son‘s death. For\nexample, she stated, she tries not to allow anyone to get close to her because she\ndoes not want to ―hurt like that again.‖ She also explained that the worst part for\nher may be knowing her son died a violent death and that she was not there to\nprotect him. Thompson told the jury that she moved out of the state after her son‘s\ndeath because she could not cope, that she misses him every day, and that ―[i]t will\nnever get any easier.‖\n       During closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Thompson‘s testimony\nseveral times, reminding the jury how life had changed for the worse for\n\n                                         52\n\fThompson and her daughter after Lamons‘s violent death, and urging the jury to\ngive weight to the impact of Lamons‘s murder on his mother when evaluating the\nfactor (b) evidence.\n\n               b. Discussion\n       Defendant contends that the admission of victim impact evidence relating\nto a crime other than the capital offense exceeded the constitutionally permissible\nscope of such aggravating evidence under the principles established in Payne v.\nTennessee (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Payne). Defendant further asserts that the jury\nwas improperly influenced in its penalty determination by the irrelevant, highly\nemotional, and prejudicial victim impact evidence relating to the noncapital\nmurder of Cory Lamons.\n       As a preliminary matter, the Attorney General asserts that defendant‘s\nclaim is forfeited because defense counsel did not object to the factor (b) victim\nimpact evidence on the ground that the admissibility of such evidence is limited to\nthe circumstances of the capital offense. We find to the contrary that defendant‘s\nargument was fairly included in defense counsel‘s objection to the prosecutor‘s\nmotion to admit victim impact evidence relating to factor (b) criminal activity\ngenerally. The prosecutor‘s written motion asking the court to admit the victim\nimpact evidence argued that the law allowed jurors to consider not just victim\nimpact evidence relating to the capital murder, but also to consider victim impact\nevidence relating to the ―victims and surviving victims‖ of the defendant‘s\nfactor (b) crimes. In a written response, which was captioned, ―The Defense\nObjects to Victim Impact Statements of Factor (b) Crimes,‖ defense counsel\nmaintained that such evidence is not admissible at all unless it is relevant to\nproving that the incident in question met the definition of factor (b) criminal\nactivity. In a fallback position, counsel‘s written motion further argued that even\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\fif victim impact evidence is relevant to crimes unrelated to the capital offense, the\nadmission of such evidence should be limited to testimony by the actual victims,\nnot family or friends of the victims. Although counsel raised only the latter point\nat the hearing on the motion, he submitted the issue on his written motion. On this\nrecord, we conclude the claim that victim impact evidence is permissible only as it\nrelates to the capital offense is an argument that was fairly included in defendant‘s\nobjection below and, therefore, is preserved for appeal.\n       We reach a different conclusion, however, to the extent defendant claims\nthat the testimony by Lamons‘s mother was highly emotional and prejudicial and\nthereby improperly influenced the jury. As previously mentioned, the trial court\noverruled the defense objection to the factor (b) victim impact testimony without\nprejudice, expressly affording defense counsel an opportunity to raise other\nobjections to the challenged testimony. Counsel did not object to the testimony by\nLamons‘s mother on the ground it was unduly emotional or prejudicial, either\nbefore or during its presentation. Defendant, therefore, has not preserved that\nissue for appeal. (People v.

To the contrary, this court has found that evidence or argument regarding\nthe impact of a capital defendant‘s factor (b) crimes on the victims of those crimes\nwas ―highly relevant to the life-or-death decision.‖ (Benson, supra, at p. 797; see\nKaris, supra, at p. 641.)\n       In Payne, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827, the high court overruled its prior\ndecisions in Booth and Gathers and announced that the Eighth Amendment does\n\n                                         55\n\fnot bar states from permitting the admission of victim impact evidence. As the\ncourt explained, ―a State may properly conclude that for the jury to assess\nmeaningfully the defendant‘s moral culpability and blameworthiness, it should\nhave before it at the sentencing phase evidence of the specific harm caused by the\ndefendant.‖ (Payne, supra, at p. 825.) Central to the court‘s decision in Payne\nwas the notion that the prosecution has a legitimate interest in counteracting the\nmitigating evidence that the defendant is entitled to present to the jury. (Ibid.)\nPayne criticized Booth for having ―unfairly weighted the scale in a capital trial,‖\nwhich places no limitations on the defendant‘s presentation of relevant mitigating\nevidence regarding his own circumstances but, under Booth, precluded the\nprosecution from showing the loss to the victim‘s family that resulted from the\ndefendant‘s homicide. (Payne, at. p. 822.)\n       Subsequent to Payne, this court held in People v.

And, as previously mentioned, both before and\nafter the decision in Payne, this court has repeatedly recognized the relevance of\nvictim impact evidence relating to factor (b) crimes of violence.\n       Defendant acknowledges the numerous decisions upholding the\nadmissibility of victim impact evidence under section 190.3, factor (b). He points\nout, however, that in People v. Boyde (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405904\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405904/people-v-boyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249 (Boyde) this court\nreached the contrary conclusion that section 190.3, factor (b), did not permit\nvictims of the defendant‘s prior offenses to testify regarding the impact that the\ncrimes had had on their lives. As defendant correctly observes, no decision has\nexpressly addressed the apparent inconsistency between Boyde and the many\ndecisions approving evidence and argument regarding the impact on the victims of\n\n                                          56\n\fa defendant‘s factor (b) criminal activity. He argues in this regard that Boyde was\ncorrectly decided because the plain language of section 190.3, factor (b) does not\nsupport the conclusion that the electorate, in enacting the death penalty law,\nintended to allow victim impact testimony regarding crimes unrelated to the\ncapital murder.\n       Defendant‘s statutory construction argument is premised on a textual\ndistinction between section 190.3, factors (a) and (b). Specifically, he emphasizes\nthat although factor (a) expressly refers to the ―circumstances‖ of the capital\ncrime, no such language appears in factor (b). Defendant points out that Edwards\nfound the commonly understood meaning of the ―circumstances of the crime of\nwhich the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding‖ (§ 190.3, factor (a),\nitalics added), included ―the specific harm caused by the defendant,‖ which in turn\nincluded the impact on the victim‘s family. (Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835.)\nIn defendant‘s view, had the electorate intended factor (b) to permit victim impact\ntestimony, it likewise would have referred to the ―circumstances‖ of the prior\ncriminal activity.\n       Defendant fails to persuade that the textual distinction between factors (a)\nand (b) compels the conclusion that the electorate intended to preclude victim\nimpact testimony and argument relating to violent criminal activity other than the\ncapital crime. Notwithstanding the difference in text, and as previously discussed,\nthis court has long construed factor (b) as permitting ―evidence showing the\ncircumstances of the prior violent criminal activity.‖ (People v. Brown (1988)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405930\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405930/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445, italics added; accord, People v. Benson, supra, 52 Cal.3d at\np. 797; People v. Karis, supra, 46 Cal.3d at p. 640.) Victim impact evidence\nrelating to factor (b) crimes, like evidence regarding other circumstances of that\ncriminal activity, serves to ―fully illuminate their seriousness‖ (People v. Holloway\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508855\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508855/people-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143), thereby assisting the penalty phase jury in its\n\n                                         57\n\fassessment of ―the character and record of the defendant.‖ (People v. Karis, supra,\nat p. 640.)\n       Nor are we persuaded that this court‘s decision in Edwards supports\ndefendant‘s statutory construction argument. Defendant is correct that Edwards\nfocused on section 190.3, factor (a)‘s express reference to the ―circumstances‖ of\nthe capital crime when construing that provision to contemplate the admission of\nvictim impact testimony. This was not the only basis of the holding in Edwards,\nhowever. Notably, Edwards also relied on People v. Benson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which found no impropriety in the prosecutor‘s argument regarding the\nimpact on the victims of the defendant‘s other violent criminal conduct. (Id. at\npp. 795-797.) Benson viewed that information as ―highly relevant to the life-or-\ndeath decision.‖ (Id. at p. 797.) In a footnote, Benson expressly declined to\ndecide whether Booth and Gathers would prohibit the admission of evidence and\nargument regarding the emotional impact of factor (b) criminal activity on the\nvictim‘s family. (Benson, at p. 797, fn. 9.) But Edwards read Benson to\n―strongly‖ imply that such evidence or argument fell within the scope of section\n190.3, factor (b). (Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835.) With that understanding\nof Benson in mind, the court in Edwards reasoned that ―[i]f victim impact\nevidence is permitted under factor (b), it should certainly be permitted under factor\n(a).‖ (Edwards, supra, at p. 835.)\n       We furthermore find no basis on which to conclude that Boyde states the\nbetter rule, as defendant maintains. In Boyde, the prosecution presented testimony\nby eight victims of the defendant‘s prior robberies and assaults. When describing\nthe circumstances of those incidents, the witnesses mentioned how the crimes had\naffected their lives. (Boyde, supra, 46 Cal.3d at pp. 247, 249.) The court in Boyde\nagreed with the defendant that the ―testimony by victims of other offenses about\nthe impact that the event had on their lives‖ was improperly admitted because it\n\n                                         58\n\fwas unrelated to any of the statutory aggravating factors. (Id. at p. 249.)\nHowever, that single sentence comprised the opinion‘s entire discussion of the\nissue; there was neither statutory analysis nor citation to authority. The decision‘s\ncursory treatment of the issue provides us with no reasoned basis on which to\nadopt its conclusion.\n       Until the present matter, this court‘s decisions have largely ignored Boyde‘s\nanomalous conclusion. Its holding, however, is inconsistent with every other\npronouncement by this court on the subject, including a decision that was issued in\nthe very same month that Boyde was filed. (See People v. Karis, supra, 46 Cal.3d\nat p. 641 [―we believe that the impact of a capital defendant‘s [noncapital] crimes\non the victims of those crimes is relevant to the penalty decision‖].) We therefore\nexpressly overrule Boyde to the extent it concludes that victim impact evidence\nrelating to factor (b) criminal activity is inadmissible, and reaffirm the unbroken\nline of authority beginning with People v. Benson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which\nhas approved evidence and prosecutorial argument regarding the impact of the\ndefendant‘s factor (b) crimes on the victims of that criminal activity.\n       We conclude furthermore that evidence and argument regarding the impact\nof a factor (b) homicide on a member of the victim‘s family is relevant to the\njury‘s penalty determination, subject to the same limitations on its admissibility\nthat govern victim impact evidence as it relates to the capital crime. (See\nEdwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 836, quoting People v. Haskett (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194338\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194338/people-v-haskett/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864 [cautioning against the admission of ―irrelevant information or\ninflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury‘s attention from its proper role or\ninvites an irrational, purely subjective response‖].) Defense counsel argued below\nthat victim impact testimony by a noncapital homicide victim‘s family member is\nunnecessary because the severity of the crime of murder ―speaks for itself.‖ We\ndisagree. In the court‘s discretion, admission of victim impact testimony by the\n\n                                         59\n\floved one of a victim of a factor (b) homicide serves to ―fully illuminate [its]\nseriousness.‖ (People v. Holloway, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 143; see People v.\nPrice, supra, 1 Cal.4th at p. 479 [an emotional reaction from a factor (b) victim\nprovides ―an assessment of the seriousness of [the] defendant‘s criminal\nconduct‖]; see, e.g., People v.

It would be\nanomalous to permit the penalty phase jury to consider the emotional suffering\ncaused to the victim of the defendant‘s nonfatal violent criminal activity but to\npreclude from the jury‘s moral assessment the suffering caused by the defendant‘s\ncommission of a factor (b) homicide.\n       As this court has observed in the context of capital crimes, ―[v]ictim impact\nevidence is admissible to establish the unique loss resulting from a murder and\nthereby to counteract the defendant‘s mitigating evidence.‖ (People v.

The same purpose is served when the loss results\nfrom a noncapital homicide presented under factor (b). In both settings, the jury is\nassisted in its assessment of the defendant‘s moral culpability and\nblameworthiness with evidence of ―the specific harm caused by the defendant.‖\n(Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835; see Payne, supra, 501 U.S. at p. 825.)\nVictim impact evidence relating to a factor (b) homicide is particularly relevant in\na case such as the present matter, in which the testimony by the homicide victim‘s\nmother regarding the impact of her son‘s murder on her and her daughter served as\na counterweight to defendant‘s case in mitigation. As previously recounted, the\ndefense mental health expert, Dr. Flores, testified that defendant‘s violent actions\n\n                                         60\n\fand behavior were governed by defendant‘s own moral and ethical code.\nDefendant himself attempted to minimize the seriousness of his prior acts of\nviolence by explaining to the jury that he directed his acts of violence at drug users\nand dealers, gang members, and convicts. More specifically, he stated that Cory\nLamons was a drug addict who owed him money and had stolen from two women\nhe knew.6\n       In addition to arguing that the electorate did not intend to permit victim\nimpact evidence relating to factor (b) crimes, defendant asserts that the admission\nof such evidence in his case amounted to federal constitutional error. He\nacknowledges that our decisions have consistently held that victim impact\nevidence relating to factor (b) criminal activity does not violate the federal or state\nConstitution. (See, e.g., People v.

With regard to a judge‘s sentencing determination in a noncapital\ncase, Levitt‘s conclusion is contrary to article I, section 28, of the California\nConstitution, and section 1191.1, enacted in 1982 pursuant to initiative by the\npassage of Proposition 8, ―The Victim‘s Bill of Rights.‖ In relevant part, section\n1191.1 requires the criminal sentencing judge to consider a victim impact\nstatement by a deceased victim‘s ―next of kin‖ expressing his or her views\nregarding the crime.

(See, e.g., Sherman v. State,\n965 P.2d at pp. 913-914; see also People v. Davis (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801680\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801680/people-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618\n[rejecting on similar grounds a nearly identical challenge to the admissibility of\nfactor (b) victim impact evidence]; People v.

Although other out-of-state\ndecisions have concluded that Payne does not contemplate victim impact\ntestimony relating to a noncapital crime (see, e.g., Cantu v. State (Tex.Crim.App.\n1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448649\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448649/cantu-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637-638), we are neither bound nor persuaded by their\nconclusions. Indeed, Payne‘s reasoning suggests that it indirectly supports the\nadmissibility of factor (b) victim impact evidence and argument. As previously\ndiscussed, central to Payne‘s holding was the notion of striking a more appropriate\nbalance between the nearly unlimited scope of mitigating evidence that a\ndefendant is entitled to introduce and the prosecution‘s narrowly circumscribed\nevidence in aggravation.\n       We previously have declined to depart from our prior conclusion that the\nadmission of victim impact evidence regarding noncapital crimes does not violate\nthe federal Constitution. (People v. Virgil, supra, 51 Cal.45th at p. 1276; People\nv. Davis, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 618.) Defendant‘s argument here provides no\nadditional reasons to reconsider our precedents on the subject.\n\n                                         62\n\f           2. Addressing jurors individually during closing argument\n       Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed reversible misconduct\nduring closing remarks at the penalty phase by addressing his argument to jurors\nindividually rather than as a group. We conclude that defendant has forfeited his\nclaim because counsel failed to object, and that his claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel based on that omission is more appropriately raised in a petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus.\n\n               a. Background\n       Near the end of the prosecutor‘s closing argument, he emphasized that\ndefendant himself was the only one to blame — not drug abuse, his family, his\nteachers, society or the prison system — for ―all the agony that he caused, for all\nthe hurt that he caused, for all the violence that he caused.‖ With regard to the\nharm caused by defendant, the prosecutor argued that ―[j]ustice will be served\nwhen those who are not injured by crime feel as indignant as those who are.\nThat‘s when justice is served. When people who are not directly injured by the\ncrime feel as indignant as those that are.‖ Continuing with this theme, the\nprosecutor then addressed each of the 12 jurors individually as follows:\n       ―Are you indignant yet, sir?\n       ―Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, sir? Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, sir? Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, sir? Are you indignant yet, sir?\n       ―How about you, sir?\n       ―How about you sir, Are you indignant yet?\n       ―How about you, ma‘am?\n       ―How about you, sir?\n       ―How about you ma‘am?\n\n\n                                         63\n\f       ―How about you ma‘am?\n       ―How about you ma‘am?‖\n       Nothing in the record suggests that any juror responded to the prosecutor‘s\nindividual query.\n       Directing his remarks to the jury as a whole again, the prosecutor then\nstated, ―Enough is enough,‖ and asked jurors whether they feel what the family\nmembers of Scott Miller and Cory Lamons feel. ―Don‘t say yes,‖ the prosecutor\ncautioned, ―because you don‘t unless you have lost a daughter or a son.‖ The\nprosecutor urged the jury, however, to ―put a value on it. Put a value on it. Is it\nenough yet?‖ Referring to the two murders as defendant‘s ―partial trail of blood\nand horror,‖ the prosecutor reiterated, ―Enough is enough,‖ and argued that\ndefendant had forfeited his right to live and ―so richly deserves the ultimate\npunishment.‖\n\n                  b. Discussion\n       Defendant argues that the prosecutor committed egregious misconduct by\naddressing each juror individually during closing argument in violation of his right\nto due process.\n       ― ‗ ―When a prosecutor‘s intemperate behavior is sufficiently egregious that\nit infects the trial with such a degree of unfairness as to render the subsequent\nconviction a denial of due process, the federal Constitution is violated.‖ ‘\n[Citations.]‖ (People v.

(People v. Linton, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 1205; People v. Huggins (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575903\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575903/people-v-huggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251-252.) Defense\ncounsel neither objected to the prosecutor‘s rhetorical questions, nor asked the\ncourt to admonish the jury. Defendant therefore has forfeited his claim of\nmisconduct. (People v. Thomas (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944.)\n       Defendant does not attempt to explain counsel‘s omission. Nor does he\nargue that any of the exceptions to the forfeiture rule are applicable here. Rather,\nhe claims that the failure to object and ask for an admonition constituted a\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel that\nrequires reversal of the death sentence.\n\n                                           65\n\f        The two-prong standard governing claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is well settled. ― ‗ ―In assessing claims of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel, we consider whether counsel‘s representation fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and whether the\ndefendant suffered prejudice to a reasonable probability, that is, a probability\nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.

(People v.\nLedesma, supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 216.) We also have observed that ―[a]n appellate\ncourt‘s ability to determine from the record whether an attorney has provided\nconstitutionally deficient legal representation is in the usual case severely\nhampered by the absence of an explanation of an attorney‘s strategy.‖ (People v.\nWeaver (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633370\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633370/people-v-weaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 955.) For this reason, we long ago adopted the\nrule that ― ‗[i]f the record on appeal fails to show why counsel acted or failed to\nact in the instance asserted to be ineffective, unless counsel was asked for an\nexplanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no\nsatisfactory explanation, the claim must be rejected on appeal.

He asserts, however, that there could be no satisfactory explanation for\ncounsel‘s omission. Specifically, he observes that an objection and request for\nadmonition would not have raised any issue adverse to the defense case. Rather,\nhe posits, it would have diffused a damaging argument that pandered to the\npassions and prejudice of the jury.\n       Defendant‘s assertion notwithstanding, we cannot say ― ‗ ―there simply\ncould be no satisfactory explanation‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Mendoza Tello, supra,\n15 Cal.4th at p. 266) for defense counsel‘s failure to object. Indeed, one possible\ntactical reason for the omission appears in the record itself, which indicates that\ndefense counsel expressly referred to the challenged argument during his own\nclosing remarks. Counsel argued to the jurors that by inquiring, ―Are you\nindignant? Are you indignant? Are you indignant?‖ the prosecutor was asking\nthem to make their penalty decision based on hate. Counsel then explained to the\njury that the penalty decision must be based, not on hate, but on weighing the\naggravating factors and the mitigating factors. Counsel may have made a\ndeliberate tactical choice not to object to the prosecutor‘s argument in order to use\nit to advantage during his own closing statement. Because we cannot confidently\nconclude based solely on the appellate record whether counsel had a legitimate\nreason for his omission, however, we do not reach the merits of defendant‘s claim\nof constitutionally inadequate assistance. Here, like in most cases, defendant‘s\nclaim is more appropriately presented by way of a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus. (See People v.

Constitutionality of California’s death penalty law\n       Defendant challenges the constitutionality of various features of\nCalifornia‘s capital sentencing scheme, alone and in combination.

(Evid. Code, § 350.) The\nrationale for the rule is as simple as it is important: Excluding irrelevant evidence\nfurthers the goal of rational, impartial factfinding and decisionmaking by the jury.\n       Where the defendant‘s life is at stake, the need for reliability is heightened.\n(Caldwell v. Mississippi (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111471\"><a href=\"/opinion/111471/caldwell-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340.) Courts must take special care\nin capital cases to ensure that the evidence offered at the penalty phase is relevant\nto the question of who should live and who should die. As we have long held, the\nfocus of that individualized inquiry is the defendant‘s character and the\ncircumstances of the crime for which the defendant is being tried. (People v.

Although the jury must be allowed to consider any aspect of\na defendant‘s character or record that may be offered as a basis for leniency, there\nis no corresponding requirement that it also be allowed to consider every\n\fcontention the prosecution might advance as a justification for the death penalty.\n(Boyd, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 775.) Rather, as the majority acknowledges (maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 54), the evidence in aggravation is limited strictly to those factors\nenumerated in Penal Code section 190.3. (Boyd, at p. 775.)\n       In this case, the trial court admitted evidence at the penalty phase that was\nnot authorized by Penal Code section 190.3. Nor was it relevant to defendant‘s\ncharacter or to the circumstances of the crime for which defendant was being tried.\nYet the majority finds no error. I respectfully disagree.\n                                           I.\n       Defendant murdered Cory Lamons in April 2004. He pleaded guilty to\nsecond degree murder in June 2006 and was sentenced to 45 years to life.\n       Three years later, defendant was charged with the 2002 murder of Scott\nMiller, which is the subject of this automatic appeal. At the penalty phase of the\nproceeding, Lamons‘s mother, Sharon Thompson, was called to testify. Thompson\nwas not a witness to her son‘s murder, nor did she have any information about the\ncircumstances of her son‘s death or about the capital crime that led to defendant‘s\nconviction in this proceeding. The prosecution called her to the stand instead to\ntalk about how her son‘s death had affected her life. Thompson‘s testimony was\nplainly genuine — and heartfelt: ―Well, first thing you do is you can‘t believe that\nit really is happening to you. And then it feels like the air is being totally sucked\nout of the whole room. Then you keep thinking it really isn‘t happening, that\nsomebody is pulling a joke on you. [¶] Then the rest of your life you keep looking\non the street thinking someone has pulled a really horrible joke on you and you are\ngoing to see him walking down the street. [¶] His sister helped raise him, and that\nwas really horrible. And then the worst part of it is knowing that they died a\nviolent death. Because you weren‘t there to protect them. [¶] I miss him every\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fday of my life. I actually moved out of the state after he died because I just\ncouldn‘t take it anymore.‖\n       Thompson added that her grief never gets any better or any easier. When\nremembering her son‘s birthday a week earlier at her workplace, she broke down\nand cried. And when asked how she had changed as a result of her son‘s murder,\nThompson reflected, ―I think I am more closed up. I try not to let anybody get\nclose to me. I don‘t want to hurt like that ever again.‖\n                                          II.\n       No one disputes that Thompson‘s testimony would have been admissible at\nthe sentencing hearing following defendant‘s conviction for her son‘s murder.\n(Pen. Code, § 1191.1.) Nor is there any doubt that her testimony would have been\nrelevant as victim impact evidence at the penalty phase, had this capital proceeding\nbeen based on Lamons‘s murder. (Pen. Code, § 190.3, factor (a); see People v.\nCage (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287-289 [upholding the admissibility of testimony\nfrom the victim‘s mother about the impact of her daughter‘s death].) The question\nhere is different: whether Thompson‘s testimony concerning her reaction to one\nmurder was relevant to the jury‘s penalty determination for an unrelated capital\nmurder. So far as my research reveals, every other jurisdiction to have considered\nthe admissibility of this category of evidence has concluded that it is not relevant.\nThe majority‘s decision to the contrary mistakenly conflates two distinct categories\nof evidence: evidence that tends to show the circumstances of an uncharged crime,\nand evidence of the uncharged crime‘s effect on family or friends who were neither\nvictims of nor witnesses to the crime. Our case law offers ample justification for\nthe admissibility of the first category of evidence. Thompson‘s testimony,\nhowever, falls in the second category.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                          A.\n       California‘s death penalty statute provides that a defendant‘s character and\nrecord, including the presence or absence of other violent criminal activity by the\ndefendant, is relevant to the penalty determination.

(Id. at p. 797.)\n       We drew a distinction, though, between two kinds of evidence: one kind\nconcerning ―the effect of such criminal activity on the victims‖ (the type of\nevidence presented in Benson), and another involving indicia of ―the emotional\nimpact of such criminal activity on the victim‘s family‖ (as in the case now before\n\n                                           4\n\fus).

The majority does not directly address how the\nreactions of someone who did not witness or experience a crime could be a basis\nfor making inferences about the nature of the crime. Instead, the majority contends\nthat it would be ―anomalous‖ to allow victims of a defendant‘s nonfatal criminal\nactivity to testify while precluding testimony from the surviving family and friends\nof a homicide victim. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 60.) But there is no anomaly. Anyone\n— including surviving family and friends — who witnessed the criminal activity\nthat is introduced under factor (b), whether as a victim or as an observer, may\ntestify about the circumstances of that crime. (Cf. People v.

Such testimony could include evidence of the enduring\nphysical or emotional impact of that crime, to the extent those effects tend to show\nthe nature of a defendant‘s acts. But factor (b) does not contemplate an inquiry\ninto the emotional state of those who are complete strangers to a crime –– indeed,\nit does not contemplate such an inquiry even if they are tied by kinship or\nfriendship to those who were victims. Such testimony sheds no light on the\nvulnerability of the victim or the viciousness of the defendant‘s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                           B.\n       The majority also analogizes Thompson‘s testimony about the loss of her\nson to the victim impact testimony from surviving family and friends of the capital\nmurder victim that the high court authorized in Payne v.

Yet this analogy is unpersuasive, because it\noverlooks the legal distinction between information related to an uncharged crime\nand evidence that concerns the capital murder for which the defendant is on trial.\n       That distinction exists because the choice between death and life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole properly rests on two — and only\ntwo — categories of evidence: the defendant‘s character, and the circumstances of\nthe capital murder itself. (People v. Dyer, supra, 45 Cal.3d at p. 70.) As part of\nthe latter category of evidence, a jury may consider ―the harm caused by the\ndefendant as a result of the crime charged‖ (Payne, supra, 501 U.S. at p. 819,\nitalics added), ―the specific harm caused by the crime in question‖ (id. at p. 825,\nitalics added), and ―the human cost of the crime of which the defendant stands\nconvicted‖ (id. at p. 827, italics added). The purpose of such evidence is to remind\nthe jury that just as the defendant should be considered a ―uniquely individual\nhuman being[]‖ (Woodson v. North Carolina, supra, 428 U.S. at p. 304 (plur. opn.\nof Stewart, J.)), so too is the victim an individual to his or her family and to society\nin general. (Payne, at p. 825.) To withhold evidence about the capital murder\nvictim would ―prevent the jury from having before it all the information necessary\nto determine the proper punishment for a first-degree murder.‖ (Ibid.)\n       But Payne did not articulate a rationale for the admission of testimony\nconcerning the emotional reactions of those who, while related to a victim of a\ndefendant‘s prior forcible or violent criminal conduct, are strangers to the capital\ncrime, and the majority opinion offers none. Just as, in Price, it would not have\n\n                                           7\n\fbeen appropriate to call the spouses of the peace officers who were locked in their\npatrol car‘s trunk to testify about the effect of their husbands‘ ordeal on their own\nlives, Thompson‘s feelings about her son‘s murder were not relevant under factor\n(b) to the determination of the appropriate penalty for Miller‘s murder. To be sure,\nThompson‘s feelings were genuine, profound, and indisputably painful and\nmoving. But they shed no light on defendant‘s conduct in killing her son or on the\nlikelihood that the capital murder of which he was convicted was a product of his\ncharacter rather than an accident of his situation.\n       It is not sufficient to assert, as the majority does, that factor (b) evidence\nencompasses ― ‗the circumstances of the prior violent criminal activity.‘ ‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 57.) To be admissible, the particular circumstances sought to be\nintroduced must still be relevant to the jury‘s task of fixing the penalty. (Evid.\nCode, §§ 210, 350; see St. Clair v. Commonwealth (Ky. 2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n627, 631 [―evidence of the circumstances of [an uncharged] murder is qualitatively\ndifferent from evidence of the crime‘s impact on its victim,‖ the latter having ―a\ncomplete failure of relevance‖].) For purposes of factor (b), such circumstances\nare relevant only to the extent they tend to illuminate the nature of the defendant‘s\nprior violent or forcible act.\n       The majority‘s reasoning is also at odds with decisions in a number of our\nsister jurisdictions.

The majority is quite correct that it is not bound by the\nabundant out-of-state authority rejecting its view, but the analysis in those cases\nseems more thorough and persuasive to me than what the majority provides.\n       In People v. Hope (Ill. 1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, for example, the Supreme\nCourt of Illinois overturned a penalty judgment on the ground that a widow was\nimproperly allowed to testify about the loss of her husband. (Id. at pp. 1287-1289.)\nThe court determined that Illinois‘s victim‘s rights statute, which resembles our\nVictim‘s Bill of Rights (Pen. Code, § 1191.1), did ―not contemplate . . . an\nexpansion of victim impact statements to include evidence from victims other than\nthe victims of the offense on trial.‖ (Hope, at p. 1287.) Nor did the Hope court\nfind any other indication that the widow‘s testimony could be relevant to the jury‘s\npenalty determination: ―Payne clearly contemplates that victim impact evidence\nwill come only from a survivor of the murder for which the defendant is presently\non trial, not from survivors of offenses collateral to the crime for which defendant\nis being tried.‖ (Hope, at p. 1288.) Thus, while the details of uncharged crimes\ncan be proper aggravating factors, in that they illuminate the character and record\nof the capital defendant, the impact of those crimes on the relatives of the actual\nvictims is ―simply too attenuated to be relevant.‖ (Id. at p. 1289.)\n       The Supreme Court of Kentucky reached a similar conclusion in St. Clair v.\nCommonwealth, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which found error in the admission of a\nwidow‘s testimony about the impact of an uncharged murder. The court\ndistinguished the widow‘s testimony from the circumstances of the uncharged\nmurder itself and concluded that her testimony was ―a step too far removed to be\nrelevant to sentencing for the crime being tried.‖ (Id. at p. 626.) Because the\nimpact of the uncharged murder was ―not a circumstance‖ of the charged crime nor\n―part of the character of the accused,‖ the admission of her testimony violated the\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fEighth Amendment and deprived the defendant of due process. (St. Clair, at p. 629\n& fn. 19.)\n       And in Cantu v. State (Tex.Crim.App. 1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448649\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448649/cantu-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the criminal\ncourt of last resort in Texas found error in the admission of testimony about the\nimpact of an uncharged rape and murder on the victim‘s mother. The court held\nthat the mother‘s testimony was not relevant to any matter of consequence in\ndetermining the penalty and that Payne ―does not contemplate admission of such\nevidence as permissible under the Eighth Amendment.‖ (Cantu, at p. 637.)\n       Indeed, as best I can tell, we are now the only jurisdiction in the country to\nexpand the scope of aggravating evidence in a capital trial to this extent. I\nrecognize that California law allows the family and friends of a murder victim to\nexplain, at the penalty phase of the capital trial, what that loss has meant to them,\nso as to provide the jury with a full picture of the harm caused by the defendant ―\n‗as a result of the crime charged.‘ ‖ (Edwards, supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 835.)\nCalifornia law also permits the jury to consider the defendant‘s background and\ncharacter, which can often be conveyed by the defendant‘s use of force or violence\nin other situations. (People v. Nelson (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357828/people-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222-223.) To prove\nthe extent of the defendant‘s force or violence, California law authorizes the jury to\nconsider a range of evidence: not just eyewitness testimony as to the defendant‘s\nacts, but also evidence of the victim‘s suffering — to the extent such evidence\ntends to illuminate how forceful, how violent, or how vicious the defendant‘s acts\nwere. (Cf. People v. Streeter, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 264.) But if we heed our duty\nto ― ‗strike a careful balance‘ ‖ in this area (People v. Murtishaw (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2359622\"><a href=\"/opinion/2359622/people-v-murtishaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 595), we should also conclude that evidence of the suffering experienced by\nthose who did not witness or experience the defendant‘s use of force or violence is\nsimply not admissible at the penalty phase of a capital trial. Such evidence is\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\frelevant neither to the murder for which the defendant is on trial nor to establish\nhis or her character.\n       The majority cites two cases in which the trial court nonetheless allowed\nrelatives to testify about the effect an uncharged homicide had on their lives. (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 60, citing People v. Johnson (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and People v.\nAdams (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) In neither instance did the defendant challenge the\nrelevance of the testimony, and we thus had no occasion to offer — and did not\noffer — any justification for its admissibility. (Johnson, at p. 993; Adams, at\np. 573.) The majority likewise fails to support its conclusion that Thompson‘s\ntestimony was relevant to the choice of penalty. I therefore conclude, as did courts\nin every other jurisdiction to consider the question, that its admission was error.\n       I concur in the judgment, though, because I find that the error in the\nadmission of Thompson‘s testimony was harmless. Her testimony about the\nimpact of the murder on her life was quite brief, about two pages in the reporter‘s\ntranscript. The jury instructions did not focus the jury‘s attention on — or even\nmention — the impact of defendant‘s uncharged conduct on surviving relatives.\nFinally, the ultimate impact of Thompson‘s testimony likely paled in comparison\nto the voluminous aggravating evidence that defendant had killed three people in\nseparate incidents, had a substantial record of violent conduct in and out of\ncustody, and had attempted to orchestrate violent attacks even while he was in\ncustody awaiting trial. So I find no reasonable possibility that her testimony\naffected the jury‘s decision to sentence defendant to death, which, after all, was the\nverdict defendant himself had requested. (People v.
