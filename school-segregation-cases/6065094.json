Dist. RE-1J v. Loveland—Governmental\n2   Immunity—Waiver of Governmental Immunity—Dangerous Condition.\n\n3          In this case, the supreme court considers the Colorado Governmental Immunity\n\n4   Act’s “recreation-area waiver,” which deprives a public entity of immunity in an action\n\n5   for injuries resulting from a dangerous condition of a public facility located in a\n\n6   recreation area. Specifically, the supreme court examines the meaning of “dangerous\n\n7   condition” under the recreation-area waiver. The supreme court holds that a non-\n\n8   negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground equipment cannot be a\n\n9   “dangerous condition” under the waiver. Given this holding, the facts respondents\n\n0   allege cannot show that a “dangerous condition” existed in this case. The supreme\n\n1   court therefore concludes that the recreation-area waiver does not apply and the\n\n2   petitioner retains its immunity from suit. The supreme court reverses the judgment of\n\n3   the court of appeals and remands to that court to reinstate the trial court’s order.\n\f1\n2                       The Supreme Court of the State of Colorado\n3                         2 East 14th Avenue • Denver, Colorado 80203\n\n\n4                                         2017 CO 54\n\n5                            Supreme Court Case No. 15SC933\n6                          Certiorari to the Colorado Court of Appeals\n7                           Court of Appeals Case No. 14CA1888\n8                                         Petitioner:\n9                            St. Vrain Valley School District RE-1J,\n0                                              v.\n1                                        Respondents:\n2       Alexa Rae Loveland, a minor, by and through her parents and next friends, Randy\n3     Loveland and Mary Nicole Loveland; and Randy Loveland and Mary Nicole Loveland,\n4                                        individually.\n\n5                                    Judgment Reversed\n6                                           en banc\n7                                         May 22, 2017\n8\n9\n0   Attorneys for Petitioner:\n1   Senter Goldfarb & Rice, LLC\n2   Thomas S.

Thomson\n9    Boulder, Colorado\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7   JUSTICE HOOD delivered the Opinion of the Court.\n\f¶1      This is the latest chapter in the legal saga of a young girl who was seriously\n\ninjured on her elementary school playground in late 2008. Alexa Rae Loveland, then\n\nnine years old, fell while using the playground’s zip line apparatus and severely\n\nfractured her wrist and forearm. Alexa and her parents filed a tort action against the\n\nschool district, seeking damages for Alexa’s injuries. Because the Colorado legislature\n\nhas limited when public entities such as the school district may be sued, we are asked to\n\ndetermine whether the Lovelands’ lawsuit falls within one of the limited exceptions to\n\nsovereign immunity under the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (“CGIA,” or “the\n\nAct”), §§ 24-10-101 to -120, C.R.S. (2016). Specifically, Alexa and her parents invoke the\n\nrecreation-area waiver, which deprives a public entity of immunity in an action for\n\ninjuries resulting from a dangerous condition of a public facility located in a recreation\n\narea.\n\n¶2      We hold that a non-negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground\n\nequipment cannot be a “dangerous condition” under the CGIA’s recreation-area\n\nwaiver. Because the facts the Lovelands allege cannot satisfy the dangerous-condition\n\nrequirement, the recreation-area waiver does not apply, and the District’s immunity\n\nunder the CGIA remains intact. The trial court was correct to conclude that it lacked\n\njurisdiction over the Lovelands’ tort action and to grant the District’s motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and we remand to that\n\ncourt to reinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the complaint in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                           I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n¶3    In 2008, then-nine-year-old Alexa Rae Loveland fell while using the zip line\n\napparatus on her school playground and fractured her wrist and right forearm. The zip\n\nline was a piece of inclined pipe that ran between two sets of vertical poles secured in\n\nthe ground. The inclined pipe had a handle attached to an interior track, and to use the\n\nzip line, a child would climb up a short ladder, stand on an elevated platform to grab\n\nthe handle, and propel him- or herself forward down the zip line track, releasing the\n\nhandle and jumping to the ground at the end of the track. There was also a sign that\n\nwarned “Adult Supervision Required.”\n\n¶4    This is not the first time we have considered issues related to this case. After\n\nAlexa’s injury, she and her parents (“the Lovelands”) filed a tort action against the St.\n\nVrain Valley School District (“the District”). The District moved to dismiss the action,\n\narguing the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because public school districts\n\nare immune from tort liability under the CGIA. The District acknowledged that section\n\n24-10-106(1)(e), referred to as the recreation-area waiver, deprives a government entity\n\nof immunity if an injury results from a “dangerous condition of any . . . public facility\n\nlocated in any park or recreation area maintained by a public entity.” But the District\n\nargued that the Lovelands could not establish the elements of the recreation-area waiver\n\nin this case for a number of reasons, one of which was that the zip line was not a public\n\nfacility. The Lovelands countered that the zip line was in fact a public facility and a\n\ndangerous condition of a public facility. The trial court agreed with the District. It\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\ffound that the zip line was not a public facility, and therefore that the recreation-area\n\nwaiver did not apply. The court granted the District’s motion to dismiss.\n\n¶5     The Lovelands filed an interlocutory appeal. The court of appeals reversed the\n\ntrial court’s ruling and held that the zip line was a public facility. See Loveland ex rel.\n\nLoveland v. St. Vrain Valley Sch. Dist. RE-1J, 2012 COA 112, ¶¶ 19, 22, 27, 328 P.3d 228,\n\n232–33.\n\n¶6     The District sought this court’s review of the court of appeals’ decision. We\n\ngranted certiorari and affirmed on different grounds. St. Vrain Valley Sch. Dist. RE-1J\n\nv. A.R.L. ex rel. Loveland (“St. Vrain I”), 2014 CO 33, ¶ 26, 325 P.3d 1014, 1023. We held\n\nthat “an individual zip line apparatus on a public playground does not qualify as a\n\n‘public facility.’”     Id. at ¶ 18, 325 P.3d at 1020.   Rather, the entire playground,\n\nconsidered as a whole, can qualify as a public facility. Id. We also concluded that the\n\npublic facility (the playground) was located in a recreation area, as required for the\n\nwaiver to apply. Id. at ¶ 34, 325 P.3d at 1024. We remanded to the trial court for\n\nadditional fact-finding on the remaining requirements of the recreation-area waiver,\n\nincluding whether there was a dangerous condition. Id. at ¶ 37; see also id. at ¶ 18 n.8,\n\n325 P.3d at 1020 n.8 (“Because the trial court made no findings of fact regarding the\n\ndangerous condition requirement, this Court cannot determine whether a dangerous\n\ncondition existed.”).\n\n¶7     On remand, the District again moved to dismiss, arguing that the recreation-area\n\nwaiver did not apply because the Lovelands failed to establish a dangerous condition\n\non the zip line. Applying the CGIA’s definition of “dangerous condition,” the trial\n\n\n                                             4\n\fcourt granted the District’s motion. The court explained that the Lovelands failed to\n\nassert what specific physical or structural condition made the zip line a “dangerous\n\ncondition” as that term is defined in the statute and as distinguished from their general\n\nassertion that a zip line is inherently dangerous. The trial court concluded that the\n\nLovelands failed to state a claim sufficient to overcome the District’s sovereign\n\nimmunity.\n\n¶8       The Lovelands appealed, and the court of appeals again reversed. The court of\n\nappeals concluded that an individual playground apparatus, such as the zip line in this\n\ncase, is a physical condition for purposes of the dangerous-condition test. Loveland v.\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Sch. Dist. RE-1J (“Loveland II”), 2015 COA 138, ¶ 17, __ P.3d __. The\n\ncourt of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Id. at ¶ 29.\n\n¶9       We granted the District’s petition for certiorari review.1\n\n            II. Standard of Review and Rules of Statutory Interpretation\n\n¶10      Questions of governmental immunity implicate subject matter jurisdiction and\n\nare determined in accordance with C.R.C.P. 12(b)(1). St. Vrain I, ¶ 9, 325 P.3d at 1018.\n\n\n\n1   We granted certiorari to review the following issues:\n         1. Whether the court of appeals erred in broadly defining “dangerous\n            condition” within section 24-10-103(1.3), C.R.S. (2015), of the Colorado\n            Governmental Immunity Act (“CGIA”), to include a playground\n            apparatus with no physical condition, thereby waiving governmental\n            immunity for all playground equipment.\n         2. Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the existence of a\n            warning sign from the manufacturer on a piece of playground\n            equipment, in and of itself, renders the equipment an unreasonable\n            risk to the health or safety of the public for purposes of establishing\n            that element of a “dangerous condition” within the CGIA.\n\n\n                                               5\n\fWhere the facts are undisputed and the only issue is one of statutory interpretation, as\n\nis the case here, we review the trial court’s ruling de novo. Id.\n\n¶11    Because the CGIA derogates the common law, we must strictly construe its\n\nimmunity provisions, but broadly construe its provisions waiving that immunity.\n\nSpringer v. City & Cty. of Denver, 13 P.3d 794, 798 (Colo. 2000). Nevertheless, as with\n\nany exercise in statutory interpretation, the focus of our analysis is legislative intent. St.\n\nVrain I, ¶ 10, 325 P.3d at 1019. To determine legislative intent, we must construe the\n\nstatute as a whole, giving consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all of its parts.\n\nDaniel v. City of Colo. Springs, 2014 CO 34, ¶ 11, 327 P.3d 891, 894. When the statutory\n\nlanguage is unambiguous, we give effect to the statute’s plain and ordinary meaning\n\nand look no further. Id. at ¶ 12. But if the statutory language is ambiguous, we may\n\nresort to aids to statutory construction to determine legislative intent. St. Vrain I, ¶ 11,\n\n325 P.3d at 1019.\n\n                                       III. Analysis\n\n¶12    We first examine the CGIA provisions governing our analysis. We then assess\n\nwhether the Lovelands have alleged facts sufficient to establish that the zip line was a\n\ndangerous condition, thereby depriving the District of immunity from suit here. The\n\nLovelands argue that the zip line was inherently dangerous; they do not present\n\nevidence that the zip line contained a physical defect caused by the District’s negligent\n\nconstruction or maintenance.       Because such evidence is required to establish the\n\nexistence of a dangerous condition, we conclude that the Lovelands’ claim is insufficient\n\nto defeat the District’s sovereign immunity.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f               A. The CGIA and “Dangerous Condition” Under the\n                           Recreation-Area Waiver\n¶13    The CGIA establishes that a public entity shall be immune from any action for\n\ninjury which lies in tort or could lie in tort, except as specifically provided elsewhere in\n\nthe Act. § 24-10-108. The Lovelands seek to invoke the recreation-area waiver, which\n\neliminates governmental immunity for injuries resulting from a “dangerous condition\n\nof any . . . public facility located in any park or recreation area maintained by a public\n\nentity.” § 24-10-106(1)(e) (emphasis added).\n\n¶14    In St. Vrain I, ¶¶ 35–36, 325 P.3d at 1024, this court established that the collection\n\nof playground equipment on which Alexa Loveland was injured was a public facility\n\nlocated in a recreation area. But the question remains whether the zip line was a\n\ndangerous condition of that public facility.\n\n¶15    The CGIA provides the following definition of “dangerous condition”:\n\n       “Dangerous condition” means either a physical condition of a facility or\n       the use thereof that constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health or safety\n       of the public, which is known to exist or which in the exercise of\n       reasonable care should have been known to exist and which condition is\n       proximately caused by the negligent act or omission of the public entity or\n       public employee in constructing or maintaining such facility. For the\n       purposes of this subsection (1.3), a dangerous condition should have been\n       known to exist if it is established that the condition had existed for such a\n       period and was of such a nature that, in the exercise of reasonable care,\n       such condition and its dangerous character should have been discovered.\n       A dangerous condition shall not exist solely because the design of any\n       facility is inadequate. The mere existence of wind, water, snow, ice, or\n       temperature shall not, by itself, constitute a dangerous condition.\n\n§ 24-10-103(1.3).\n\n¶16    This court has segregated the CGIA’s definition of “dangerous condition” into a\n\nfour-factor test.   The waiver applies if the injuries occurred as a result of: (1) the\n\n\n                                               7\n\fphysical condition of the public facility or the use thereof; (2) which constitutes an\n\nunreasonable risk to the health or safety of the public; (3) which is known to exist or\n\nshould have been known to exist in the exercise of reasonable care; and (4) which\n\ncondition is “proximately caused by the negligent act or omission of the public entity in\n\nconstructing or maintaining the facility.” See Springer, 13 P.3d at 799 (examining the\n\nterm “dangerous condition” as used in the public building waiver in CGIA subsection\n\n106(1)(c)). Additionally, “[a] dangerous condition shall not exist solely because the\n\ndesign of any facility is inadequate.” § 24-10-103(1.3).\n\n¶17    With this general framework in mind, we turn to the Lovelands’ proposed\n\napplication of the term “physical condition.”\n\n          B. “Dangerous Condition” Requires a Physical Defect in the\n                Construction or Maintenance of the Apparatus\n¶18    To show that the zip line was a dangerous condition under the foregoing test, the\n\nLovelands focus on the meaning of “physical condition,” arguing that there is nothing\n\nin the statute or case law that prevents the zip line itself—rather than some condition of\n\nthe zip line—from being the relevant “physical condition” here. The court of appeals\n\ntook a similar approach, concluding that “an individual playground apparatus is a\n\nphysical condition of a playground.” Loveland II, ¶ 17. But the Lovelands and the\n\ndivision’s interpretation fails for at least two reasons. First, it does not square with\n\nexisting precedent. Second, it fails to recognize that the second through fourth factors\n\nof the dangerous-condition test modify the first, such that whether something is a\n\n“physical condition” cannot be determined without reference to the other factors; if any\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fone of those other factors is not satisfied, there can be no “physical condition” for\n\npurposes of the dangerous-condition test. We address these two points in turn.\n\n¶19   First, this court’s previous cases interpreting section 24-10-103(1.3) have\n\nsuggested that in order to be a “dangerous condition” within the meaning of that\n\nsection, a “physical condition” must be a physical or structural defect. See Jenks v.\n\nSullivan, 826 P.2d 825, 830 (Colo. 1992) (“The dangerous condition must stem from a\n\nphysical or structural defect in the building.”), overruled on other grounds by Bertrand\n\nv. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs, 872 P.2d 223 (Colo. 1994); see also Springer, 13 P.3d at 799\n\n(considering the first factor satisfied where a “threshold plate [at the building entrance]\n\nprotruded from the floor at a height approximately twice that called for in the building\n\nplans”). Indeed, in St. Vrain I, after concluding that an individual zip line apparatus on\n\na playground does not qualify as a “public facility,” we did not suggest that the zip line\n\ncould nevertheless be a dangerous condition of the public facility, but rather that “a\n\ncondition on such an apparatus might qualify as a dangerous condition.” ¶ 18, 325 P.3d\n\nat 1020 (first emphasis added); see also id. at ¶ 18 n.8, 325 P.3d at 1020 n.8 (“For\n\nexample, the zip line could contain a ‘dangerous condition’ if it had a rusty or\n\nobstructed track due to being negligently constructed or maintained by the District.”). 2\n\n\n\n2 Longbottom v. State Board of Community Colleges & Occupational Education,\n872 P.2d 1253 (Colo. App. 1993), and Hendricks ex rel. Martens v. Weld County School\nDistrict No. 6, 895 P.2d 1120 (Colo. App. 1995), decisions not binding on this court, do\nnot require a different result.        Neither case directly examined whether the\ninjury-causing apparatus or structure at issue was in fact a “physical condition”\nconsistent with the statute. But to the extent that either case is inconsistent with the\nresult we reach today, we hold that it is no longer good law.\n\n\n                                            9\n\f¶20    Second, the other factors in the dangerous-condition test further limit what can\n\nbe a “physical condition” for purposes of the test. Most important for our analysis, the\n\nphysical condition must be caused by some negligent act or omission of the public\n\nentity in constructing or maintaining the facility. For example, in Padilla ex rel. Padilla\n\nv. School District No. 1, 25 P.3d 1176, 1178 (Colo. 2001), a developmentally disabled\n\nchild, Padilla, sought to sue her school district for negligence after she was left alone in\n\na stroller propped against the door of a storage closet as a “time out.” Padilla became\n\nagitated, the stroller fell backward, and Padilla struck her head against the floor and\n\nfractured her skull. Id. Padilla alleged that the placement of the stroller combined with\n\nthe use of the storage room as a “time out” area created a dangerous condition in a\n\npublic building. Id. at 1179. We concluded that “[w]hile Padilla may have sufficiently\n\nalleged an act of negligence . . . she did not demonstrate a sufficient connection between\n\nuse of the state of the building and a construction or maintenance activity or omission\n\nfor which the School District is responsible.”      Id. at 1183.   We held that Padilla’s\n\ncomplaint lacked sufficient facts to support a waiver of immunity. Id. The Lovelands’\n\ncomplaint is similarly lacking here. It offers no facts to suggest that the zip line was\n\nnegligently constructed or maintained.      Therefore, like the plaintiffs in Padilla, the\n\nLovelands cannot satisfy the dangerous-condition test.\n\n¶21    In sum, the statutory language at issue and our precedent support the notion that\n\nthe Lovelands must prove a defect in the condition of the zip line. But they do not even\n\nallege such a defect. Instead, they make what amounts to a design argument, which we\n\naddress next.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                     C. The Playground Design Argument Fails\n\n¶22    The Lovelands claim that they have indeed alleged a negligent act related to\n\nconstruction: they submit that the District’s negligent act was its decision to construct\n\nthe zip line on the school playground. They argue that a District employee made the\n\ndecision to purchase and install the zip line and that the employee knew or should have\n\nknown that a zip line is dangerous. Even so, this is an argument about the design of the\n\nplayground, which section 24-10-103(1.3) clearly prohibits.           § 24-10-103(1.3) (“A\n\ndangerous condition shall not exist solely because the design of any facility is\n\ninadequate.”); see also, e.g., Estate of Grant v. State, 181 P.3d 1202, 1205 (Colo. App.\n\n2008) (“Design means ‘to conceive or plan out in the mind,’ and conditions attributable\n\n‘solely to inadequate, or risky, design’ that are intrinsic to the general state of the road\n\nas initially constructed may not be considered a dangerous condition and do not waive\n\nimmunity.” (Citation omitted.)).\n\n¶23    The Lovelands argue that the zip line satisfies the dangerous-condition test\n\nbecause the zip line was inherently dangerous and that the District was negligent in\n\nplacing something inherently dangerous on the playground. But the recreation-area\n\nwaiver does not recognize such blanket claims of danger based on the design of a public\n\nfacility. On the contrary, it explicitly precludes such claims.\n\n                                     IV. Conclusion\n\n¶24    A non-negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground equipment\n\ncannot be a “dangerous condition” under the CGIA’s recreation-area waiver. Because\n\nthe facts the Lovelands allege cannot satisfy the dangerous-condition requirement, the\n\n\n                                             11\n\frecreation-area waiver does not apply, and the District’s immunity under the CGIA\n\nremains intact. The trial court was correct to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction over\n\nthe Lovelands’ tort action and to grant the District’s motion to dismiss. Accordingly,\n\nwe reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and we remand to that court to\n\nreinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the complaint in this case. 3\n\n\n\n\n3Because we conclude that the Lovelands’ claim is insufficient for the reasons stated\nabove, we do not reach the second question on which we granted certiorari review,\nwhich asks us to interpret the second factor of the dangerous-condition test.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f",

Dist. RE-1J v. Loveland—Governmental\n2   Immunity—Waiver of Governmental Immunity—Dangerous Condition.\n\n3          In this case, the supreme court considers the Colorado Governmental Immunity\n\n4   Act’s “recreation-area waiver,” which deprives a public entity of immunity in an action\n\n5   for injuries resulting from a dangerous condition of a public facility located in a\n\n6   recreation area. Specifically, the supreme court examines the meaning of “dangerous\n\n7   condition” under the recreation-area waiver. The supreme court holds that a non-\n\n8   negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground equipment cannot be a\n\n9   “dangerous condition” under the waiver. Given this holding, the facts respondents\n\n0   allege cannot show that a “dangerous condition” existed in this case. The supreme\n\n1   court therefore concludes that the recreation-area waiver does not apply and the\n\n2   petitioner retains its immunity from suit. The supreme court reverses the judgment of\n\n3   the court of appeals and remands to that court to reinstate the trial court’s order.\n\f1\n2                       The Supreme Court of the State of Colorado\n3                         2 East 14th Avenue • Denver, Colorado 80203\n\n\n4                                         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">CO</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n5                            Supreme Court Case No. 15SC933\n6                          Certiorari to the Colorado Court of Appeals\n7                           Court of Appeals Case No. 14CA1888\n8                                         Petitioner:\n9                            St. Vrain Valley School District RE-1J,\n0                                              v.\n1                                        Respondents:\n2       Alexa Rae Loveland, a minor, by and through her parents and next friends, Randy\n3     Loveland and Mary Nicole Loveland; and Randy Loveland and Mary Nicole Loveland,\n4                                        individually.\n\n5                                    Judgment Reversed\n6                                           en banc\n7                                         May 22, 2017\n8\n9\n0   Attorneys for Petitioner:\n1   Senter Goldfarb & Rice, LLC\n2   Thomas S.

Thomson\n9    Boulder, Colorado\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7   JUSTICE HOOD delivered the Opinion of the Court.\n\f¶1      This is the latest chapter in the legal saga of a young girl who was seriously\n\ninjured on her elementary school playground in late 2008. Alexa Rae Loveland, then\n\nnine years old, fell while using the playground’s zip line apparatus and severely\n\nfractured her wrist and forearm. Alexa and her parents filed a tort action against the\n\nschool district, seeking damages for Alexa’s injuries. Because the Colorado legislature\n\nhas limited when public entities such as the school district may be sued, we are asked to\n\ndetermine whether the Lovelands’ lawsuit falls within one of the limited exceptions to\n\nsovereign immunity under the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (“CGIA,” or “the\n\nAct”), §§ 24-10-101 to -120, C.R.S. (2016). Specifically, Alexa and her parents invoke the\n\nrecreation-area waiver, which deprives a public entity of immunity in an action for\n\ninjuries resulting from a dangerous condition of a public facility located in a recreation\n\narea.\n\n¶2      We hold that a non-negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground\n\nequipment cannot be a “dangerous condition” under the CGIA’s recreation-area\n\nwaiver. Because the facts the Lovelands allege cannot satisfy the dangerous-condition\n\nrequirement, the recreation-area waiver does not apply, and the District’s immunity\n\nunder the CGIA remains intact. The trial court was correct to conclude that it lacked\n\njurisdiction over the Lovelands’ tort action and to grant the District’s motion to dismiss.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and we remand to that\n\ncourt to reinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the complaint in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                           I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n¶3    In 2008, then-nine-year-old Alexa Rae Loveland fell while using the zip line\n\napparatus on her school playground and fractured her wrist and right forearm. The zip\n\nline was a piece of inclined pipe that ran between two sets of vertical poles secured in\n\nthe ground. The inclined pipe had a handle attached to an interior track, and to use the\n\nzip line, a child would climb up a short ladder, stand on an elevated platform to grab\n\nthe handle, and propel him- or herself forward down the zip line track, releasing the\n\nhandle and jumping to the ground at the end of the track. There was also a sign that\n\nwarned “Adult Supervision Required.”\n\n¶4    This is not the first time we have considered issues related to this case. After\n\nAlexa’s injury, she and her parents (“the Lovelands”) filed a tort action against the St.\n\nVrain Valley School District (“the District”). The District moved to dismiss the action,\n\narguing the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because public school districts\n\nare immune from tort liability under the CGIA. The District acknowledged that section\n\n24-10-106(1)(e), referred to as the recreation-area waiver, deprives a government entity\n\nof immunity if an injury results from a “dangerous condition of any . . . public facility\n\nlocated in any park or recreation area maintained by a public entity.” But the District\n\nargued that the Lovelands could not establish the elements of the recreation-area waiver\n\nin this case for a number of reasons, one of which was that the zip line was not a public\n\nfacility. The Lovelands countered that the zip line was in fact a public facility and a\n\ndangerous condition of a public facility. The trial court agreed with the District. It\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\ffound that the zip line was not a public facility, and therefore that the recreation-area\n\nwaiver did not apply. The court granted the District’s motion to dismiss.\n\n¶5     The Lovelands filed an interlocutory appeal. The court of appeals reversed the\n\ntrial court’s ruling and held that the zip line was a public facility. See Loveland ex rel.\n\nLoveland v. St. Vrain Valley Sch. Dist.

We held\n\nthat “an individual zip line apparatus on a public playground does not qualify as a\n\n‘public facility.’”     Id. at ¶ 18, 325 P.3d at 1020.   Rather, the entire playground,\n\nconsidered as a whole, can qualify as a public facility. Id. We also concluded that the\n\npublic facility (the playground) was located in a recreation area, as required for the\n\nwaiver to apply. Id. at ¶ 34, 325 P.3d at 1024. We remanded to the trial court for\n\nadditional fact-finding on the remaining requirements of the recreation-area waiver,\n\nincluding whether there was a dangerous condition. Id. at ¶ 37; see also id. at ¶ 18 n.8,\n\n325 P.3d at 1020 n.8 (“Because the trial court made no findings of fact regarding the\n\ndangerous condition requirement, this Court cannot determine whether a dangerous\n\ncondition existed.”).\n\n¶7     On remand, the District again moved to dismiss, arguing that the recreation-area\n\nwaiver did not apply because the Lovelands failed to establish a dangerous condition\n\non the zip line. Applying the CGIA’s definition of “dangerous condition,” the trial\n\n\n                                             4\n\fcourt granted the District’s motion. The court explained that the Lovelands failed to\n\nassert what specific physical or structural condition made the zip line a “dangerous\n\ncondition” as that term is defined in the statute and as distinguished from their general\n\nassertion that a zip line is inherently dangerous. The trial court concluded that the\n\nLovelands failed to state a claim sufficient to overcome the District’s sovereign\n\nimmunity.\n\n¶8       The Lovelands appealed, and the court of appeals again reversed. The court of\n\nappeals concluded that an individual playground apparatus, such as the zip line in this\n\ncase, is a physical condition for purposes of the dangerous-condition test.

Standard of Review and Rules of Statutory Interpretation\n\n¶10      Questions of governmental immunity implicate subject matter jurisdiction and\n\nare determined in accordance with C.R.C.P. 12(b)(1). St. Vrain I, ¶ 9, 325 P.3d at 1018.\n\n\n\n1   We granted certiorari to review the following issues:\n         1. Whether the court of appeals erred in broadly defining “dangerous\n            condition” within section 24-10-103(1.3), C.R.S. (2015), of the Colorado\n            Governmental Immunity Act (“CGIA”), to include a playground\n            apparatus with no physical condition, thereby waiving governmental\n            immunity for all playground equipment.\n         2. Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the existence of a\n            warning sign from the manufacturer on a piece of playground\n            equipment, in and of itself, renders the equipment an unreasonable\n            risk to the health or safety of the public for purposes of establishing\n            that element of a “dangerous condition” within the CGIA.\n\n\n                                               5\n\fWhere the facts are undisputed and the only issue is one of statutory interpretation, as\n\nis the case here, we review the trial court’s ruling de novo.

Nevertheless, as with\n\nany exercise in statutory interpretation, the focus of our analysis is legislative intent. St.\n\nVrain I, ¶ 10, 325 P.3d at 1019. To determine legislative intent, we must construe the\n\nstatute as a whole, giving consistent, harmonious, and sensible effect to all of its parts.\n\nDaniel v. City of Colo.

When the statutory\n\nlanguage is unambiguous, we give effect to the statute’s plain and ordinary meaning\n\nand look no further. Id. at ¶ 12. But if the statutory language is ambiguous, we may\n\nresort to aids to statutory construction to determine legislative intent. St. Vrain I, ¶ 11,\n\n325 P.3d at 1019.\n\n                                       III. Analysis\n\n¶12    We first examine the CGIA provisions governing our analysis. We then assess\n\nwhether the Lovelands have alleged facts sufficient to establish that the zip line was a\n\ndangerous condition, thereby depriving the District of immunity from suit here. The\n\nLovelands argue that the zip line was inherently dangerous; they do not present\n\nevidence that the zip line contained a physical defect caused by the District’s negligent\n\nconstruction or maintenance.       Because such evidence is required to establish the\n\nexistence of a dangerous condition, we conclude that the Lovelands’ claim is insufficient\n\nto defeat the District’s sovereign immunity.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f               A. The CGIA and “Dangerous Condition” Under the\n                           Recreation-Area Waiver\n¶13    The CGIA establishes that a public entity shall be immune from any action for\n\ninjury which lies in tort or could lie in tort, except as specifically provided elsewhere in\n\nthe Act. § 24-10-108. The Lovelands seek to invoke the recreation-area waiver, which\n\neliminates governmental immunity for injuries resulting from a “dangerous condition\n\nof any . . . public facility located in any park or recreation area maintained by a public\n\nentity.” § 24-10-106(1)(e) (emphasis added).\n\n¶14    In St. Vrain I, ¶¶ 35–36, 325 P.3d at 1024, this court established that the collection\n\nof playground equipment on which Alexa Loveland was injured was a public facility\n\nlocated in a recreation area. But the question remains whether the zip line was a\n\ndangerous condition of that public facility.\n\n¶15    The CGIA provides the following definition of “dangerous condition”:\n\n       “Dangerous condition” means either a physical condition of a facility or\n       the use thereof that constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health or safety\n       of the public, which is known to exist or which in the exercise of\n       reasonable care should have been known to exist and which condition is\n       proximately caused by the negligent act or omission of the public entity or\n       public employee in constructing or maintaining such facility. For the\n       purposes of this subsection (1.3), a dangerous condition should have been\n       known to exist if it is established that the condition had existed for such a\n       period and was of such a nature that, in the exercise of reasonable care,\n       such condition and its dangerous character should have been discovered.\n       A dangerous condition shall not exist solely because the design of any\n       facility is inadequate. The mere existence of wind, water, snow, ice, or\n       temperature shall not, by itself, constitute a dangerous condition.\n\n§ 24-10-103(1.3).\n\n¶16    This court has segregated the CGIA’s definition of “dangerous condition” into a\n\nfour-factor test.   The waiver applies if the injuries occurred as a result of: (1) the\n\n\n                                               7\n\fphysical condition of the public facility or the use thereof; (2) which constitutes an\n\nunreasonable risk to the health or safety of the public; (3) which is known to exist or\n\nshould have been known to exist in the exercise of reasonable care; and (4) which\n\ncondition is “proximately caused by the negligent act or omission of the public entity in\n\nconstructing or maintaining the facility.” See Springer, 13 P.3d at 799 (examining the\n\nterm “dangerous condition” as used in the public building waiver in CGIA subsection\n\n106(1)(c)). Additionally, “[a] dangerous condition shall not exist solely because the\n\ndesign of any facility is inadequate.” § 24-10-103(1.3).\n\n¶17    With this general framework in mind, we turn to the Lovelands’ proposed\n\napplication of the term “physical condition.”\n\n          B. “Dangerous Condition” Requires a Physical Defect in the\n                Construction or Maintenance of the Apparatus\n¶18    To show that the zip line was a dangerous condition under the foregoing test, the\n\nLovelands focus on the meaning of “physical condition,” arguing that there is nothing\n\nin the statute or case law that prevents the zip line itself—rather than some condition of\n\nthe zip line—from being the relevant “physical condition” here. The court of appeals\n\ntook a similar approach, concluding that “an individual playground apparatus is a\n\nphysical condition of a playground.” Loveland II, ¶ 17. But the Lovelands and the\n\ndivision’s interpretation fails for at least two reasons. First, it does not square with\n\nexisting precedent. Second, it fails to recognize that the second through fourth factors\n\nof the dangerous-condition test modify the first, such that whether something is a\n\n“physical condition” cannot be determined without reference to the other factors; if any\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fone of those other factors is not satisfied, there can be no “physical condition” for\n\npurposes of the dangerous-condition test. We address these two points in turn.\n\n¶19   First, this court’s previous cases interpreting section 24-10-103(1.3) have\n\nsuggested that in order to be a “dangerous condition” within the meaning of that\n\nsection, a “physical condition” must be a physical or structural defect.

Indeed, in St. Vrain I, after concluding that an individual zip line apparatus on\n\na playground does not qualify as a “public facility,” we did not suggest that the zip line\n\ncould nevertheless be a dangerous condition of the public facility, but rather that “a\n\ncondition on such an apparatus might qualify as a dangerous condition.” ¶ 18, 325 P.3d\n\nat 1020 (first emphasis added); see also id. at ¶ 18 n.8, 325 P.3d at 1020 n.8 (“For\n\nexample, the zip line could contain a ‘dangerous condition’ if it had a rusty or\n\nobstructed track due to being negligently constructed or maintained by the District.”). 2\n\n\n\n2 Longbottom v.

Neither case directly examined whether the\ninjury-causing apparatus or structure at issue was in fact a “physical condition”\nconsistent with the statute. But to the extent that either case is inconsistent with the\nresult we reach today, we hold that it is no longer good law.\n\n\n                                            9\n\f¶20    Second, the other factors in the dangerous-condition test further limit what can\n\nbe a “physical condition” for purposes of the test. Most important for our analysis, the\n\nphysical condition must be caused by some negligent act or omission of the public\n\nentity in constructing or maintaining the facility. For example, in Padilla ex rel. Padilla\n\nv. School District No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2587281\"><a href=\"/opinion/2587281/padilla-v-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178 (Colo. 2001), a developmentally disabled\n\nchild, Padilla, sought to sue her school district for negligence after she was left alone in\n\na stroller propped against the door of a storage closet as a “time out.” Padilla became\n\nagitated, the stroller fell backward, and Padilla struck her head against the floor and\n\nfractured her skull. Id. Padilla alleged that the placement of the stroller combined with\n\nthe use of the storage room as a “time out” area created a dangerous condition in a\n\npublic building. Id. at 1179. We concluded that “[w]hile Padilla may have sufficiently\n\nalleged an act of negligence . . . she did not demonstrate a sufficient connection between\n\nuse of the state of the building and a construction or maintenance activity or omission\n\nfor which the School District is responsible.”      Id. at 1183.   We held that Padilla’s\n\ncomplaint lacked sufficient facts to support a waiver of immunity. Id. The Lovelands’\n\ncomplaint is similarly lacking here. It offers no facts to suggest that the zip line was\n\nnegligently constructed or maintained.      Therefore, like the plaintiffs in Padilla, the\n\nLovelands cannot satisfy the dangerous-condition test.\n\n¶21    In sum, the statutory language at issue and our precedent support the notion that\n\nthe Lovelands must prove a defect in the condition of the zip line. But they do not even\n\nallege such a defect. Instead, they make what amounts to a design argument, which we\n\naddress next.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                     C. The Playground Design Argument Fails\n\n¶22    The Lovelands claim that they have indeed alleged a negligent act related to\n\nconstruction: they submit that the District’s negligent act was its decision to construct\n\nthe zip line on the school playground. They argue that a District employee made the\n\ndecision to purchase and install the zip line and that the employee knew or should have\n\nknown that a zip line is dangerous. Even so, this is an argument about the design of the\n\nplayground, which section 24-10-103(1.3) clearly prohibits.           § 24-10-103(1.3) (“A\n\ndangerous condition shall not exist solely because the design of any facility is\n\ninadequate.”); see also, e.g., Estate of Grant v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634441\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634441/estate-of-grant-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205 (Colo. App.\n\n2008) (“Design means ‘to conceive or plan out in the mind,’ and conditions attributable\n\n‘solely to inadequate, or risky, design’ that are intrinsic to the general state of the road\n\nas initially constructed may not be considered a dangerous condition and do not waive\n\nimmunity.” (Citation omitted.)).\n\n¶23    The Lovelands argue that the zip line satisfies the dangerous-condition test\n\nbecause the zip line was inherently dangerous and that the District was negligent in\n\nplacing something inherently dangerous on the playground. But the recreation-area\n\nwaiver does not recognize such blanket claims of danger based on the design of a public\n\nfacility. On the contrary, it explicitly precludes such claims.\n\n                                     IV. Conclusion\n\n¶24    A non-negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground equipment\n\ncannot be a “dangerous condition” under the CGIA’s recreation-area waiver. Because\n\nthe facts the Lovelands allege cannot satisfy the dangerous-condition requirement, the\n\n\n                                             11\n\frecreation-area waiver does not apply, and the District’s immunity under the CGIA\n\nremains intact. The trial court was correct to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction over\n\nthe Lovelands’ tort action and to grant the District’s motion to dismiss. Accordingly,\n\nwe reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and we remand to that court to\n\nreinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the complaint in this case. 3\n\n\n\n\n3Because we conclude that the Lovelands’ claim is insufficient for the reasons stated\nabove, we do not reach the second question on which we granted certiorari review,\nwhich asks us to interpret the second factor of the dangerous-condition test.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f</pre>",

      "syllabus": "Governmental Immunity—Waiver of Governmental Immunity—Dangerous Condition. In this case, the Supreme Court considered the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act's \"recreation-area waiver,\" which deprives a public entity of immunity in an action for injuries resulting from a dangerous condition of a public facility located in a recreation area. Specifically, the Court examined the meaning of \"dangerous condition\" under the recreation-area waiver. The Court held that a non-negligently constructed and maintained piece of playground equipment cannot be a \"dangerous condition\" under the waiver. Given this holding, the facts respondents alleged cannot show that a \"dangerous condition\" existed in this case. The Court therefore concluded that the recreation-area waiver did not apply and petitioner retained its immunity from suit. The Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded to that court to reinstate the trial court's order.",
