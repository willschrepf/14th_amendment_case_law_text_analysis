Mabee, Chattanooga, Tennessee for the Appellee, SCR Electric, Inc.\n\f                                              OPINION\n\n                                             Background\n\n\n               Plaintiff and Defendant were subcontractors working on a renovation project at the\nPleasant Grove School in Dalton, Georgia. Plaintiff had a contract with the general contractor to re-\nroof the school, and Defendant was handling the electrical work on the project.\n\n                A problem arose with the plans for the project and instead of routing the electrical\nwork through the building, Defendant was forced to find another way to route the electrical work.\nDefendant had two options, route the electrical conduit underground by trenching, or run it over the\nroof. Gary Douglas Cleaver, co-owner and president of Defendant, and Henry Apple, Plaintiff’s\nvice-president and estimator, met on the job site to discuss the situation. As a result of this\nconversation, Plaintiff performed work that included installing pitch pans so that Defendant could\nrun the electrical work across the roof.\n\n                After completion of the work, Plaintiff submitted an invoice to Defendant in the\namount of $10,828.00, for “Manufacturing and Installing 45 extra pitch pockets for Pleasant Grove\nSchool.” Defendant did not pay this invoice. After telephone conversations failed to resolve the\ndispute, Plaintiff sued Defendant seeking payment. The case was tried without a jury.\n\n                 David Randall Parris, president and owner of Plaintiff, testified at trial. Mr. Parris\ntestified there was no written contract to cover the work at issue and that he was not involved in the\nconversation between Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Apple. Mr. Parris testified that pursuant to the\nconversation between Mr. Apple and Mr. Cleaver, Plaintiff agreed: “To temporarily waterproof the\npipe supports that they were putting in the roof. And then as we got in the process of tearing off and\nreroofing, we had to do a permanent repair, a new application on it.” Mr. Parris explained that\nDefendant would make a penetration or hole in the roof and then\n\n       We had to put down a layer of mastic plastic roof cement, spread it out, put the pitch\n       pan in, set it in this plastic roof cement and put screws in all the corners, come back\n       and put another layer of mastic plastic roof cement around the whole thing, and then\n       come back with another layer of this material as such (indicating), and then as it\n       lapses on the corners you put more plastic, you know, roof cement on each corner.\n\nMr. Parris further explained\n\n       we would do a temporary repair on these type supports, which involved, you know,\n       bringing it - - it had a rubber roof on it. We had to bring the rubber back in, fill in the\n       void around the pipe if there was a void there, bring the rubber back around it, put\n       a new piece of what we call a five-inch tape, which would be glued to the existing\n       old rubber, and tighten it up around the pipe.…[Then] we had to go on with our\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f        roofing project, which meant tearing the old existing roof off and dispose the debris.\n        You know, we had to work across all these conduits and so forth. Then we had to\n        come back after we had the old roof torn off and install a new roof, which consisted\n        of two layers of insulation and two plies of, you know, felt mopped in in hot asphalt,\n        and then attach this white roof cap sheet.\n\n                 Mr. Parris testified that installing a pitch pan is a two man operation and would\ngenerally take one man-hour to install the temporary pitch pan and three more hours to install the\npermanent one for a total of four man-hours per pitch pan. Plaintiff typically charges $35 per man-\nhour for work of this type, and Plaintiff billed Defendant for 180 man-hours at $35 per hour. Mr.\nParris testified that Plaintiff did not keep records of the actual man-hours and who worked them\nbecause “[i]t was an ongoing project. The men worked on it. We’ve done this off and on for years\nof doing this, and we arrived at, you know, this hourly - -.” He explained that ongoing meant that\nthe men were already on the job site doing other things and when Defendant would cut a hole in the\nroof they would inform Plaintiff’s men who would then go over and patch it. Mr. Parris admitted\nthat the labor charge is not the actual time spent on each pitch pocket but rather a standard charge:\n“That was arrived at from 40-some-odd years of being in the business and coming up with how much\nit takes labor-wise to do a pitch pan.” Plaintiff has no records of the actual time spent on each pitch\npocket. Mr. Parris admitted that he was on the job site “maybe once a week” and that his job\nforeman never told him how much time it took to actually install each pitch pocket.\n\n                Mr. Parris testified that the invoice submitted to Defendant included a $3,234 charge\nfor materials, a 40% profit on the materials, and the labor charge for 180 hours. The invoice does\nnot contain a breakdown of any of the charges, but rather simply states the total amount due. When\nasked, Mr. Parris admitted that during his deposition he testified that normally Plaintiff uses a figure\nof cost, plus 10 or 15%. He further admitted that he testified during his deposition that it is\nPlaintiff’s normal procedure when working on a cost-plus basis to provide invoices for materials and\ntime records if a customer requests them. Plaintiff did not provide invoices for materials and time\nrecords to Defendant because, Mr. Parris testified: “They never asked for it.” Mr. Parris also\nadmitted that after his phone conversation with Mr. Cleaver regarding the dispute about the price,\nhe was “trying to come up with another number.”\n\n                 An exhibit was introduced at trial that Plaintiff testified represented the cost\ncalculations used to arrive at the total invoice price. The exhibit lists materials including 5 rolls of\nmembrane, 25 buckets of roof cement, 45 pitch pans, 29 gallons of pourable sealer, aluminum\nfibrated coating, 1 gallon of quick primer, 2 tubes of NP-1 caulking, and 1 roll of 5\" seam tape. Mr.\nParris admitted that he testified during his deposition that the only material costs that his job foreman\nturned in for the patchwork were one gallon of quick prime, NP-1, and one roll of 5\" tape.\nEverything else that Plaintiff listed as a material cost on the exhibit is just an estimate. Mr. Parris\nstated: “It’s an accurate estimate.…The part that I was emphasizing there, that’s all that he turned\nin. If he had turned in any more, it would have probably tripled that amount.…He didn’t turn it in,\nso it wasn’t on the billing.” Mr. Parris testified that hard costs included in the total invoice price\nincluded workmen’s compensation of approximately twenty-five percent per dollar, general liability\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fof approximately eight percent, state unemployment, FICA, and Medicare. Plaintiff pays its\nemployees an average of $15 per hour.\n\n               Mr. Parris testified that installing the pitch pans:\n\n       added more labor to my contract that I already had that I couldn’t get anything else\n       out of, plus the fact that - - anytime there’s a roof problem, it’s around a roof\n       penetration. Ninety-nine percent of the time it’s around a roof penetration. So we’ve\n       installed 45 penetrations here, and we had to warrant the roof. Anytime we can get\n       anything off of the roof, we want it off of the roof.\n\nHe further stated:\n\n       If those penetrations had not been in that area, we would have just walked right\n       through [the re-roofing job]. It probably added, in that particular area, added 75\n       percent more labor to have to work around - - not counting the pitch pans, just to\n       work around them, and tearing off the exiting (sic) roof and installing a new roof.\n\n                When asked about any equipment that Plaintiff had on the job site that might have\ninterfered with Defendant’s ability to trench for the electrical conduit, Mr. Parris testified that\nPlaintiff had an asphalt kettle and a dumpster near the building that they could have moved in\napproximately thirty to forty-five minutes without slowing them down on their portion of the project.\nPlaintiff’s other materials were located in an area that would not have obstructed Defendant’s ability\nto trench and those materials could have been moved in three to four hours if necessary.\n\n             Mr. Parris testified that when he had not heard anything for several months after\nsending Defendant the invoice, he called Mr. Cleaver. Mr. Parris stated:\n\n       I just called and inquired, you know, about it, and he informed me that he had an\n       agreement with Mr. Apple, that it was $1,800. I didn’t know anything about the\n       $1,800. You know, Mr. Apple was no longer employed at the time, so I - - you\n       know, we went from there going back and forth trying to resolve the issue.\n\nMr. Parris never spoke with any of Defendant’s people before the work was done and never spoke\nwith Mr. Apple about the work at issue in this case prior to the work being done.\n\n                Henry Lee Apple, Jr. testified regarding his meeting on the job site with Mr. Cleaver.\nHe testified that the architect’s representative introduced Mr. Cleaver to Mr. Apple and then left and\nthat no one but Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Apple participated in the conversation that led to the work at\nissue in this case. Mr. Apple testified that Mr. Cleaver:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f        said he was going to have to - - since he couldn’t run it the way that it was shown, he\n        was either going to have to go underground or he was going to go across the roof, one\n        of the two.\n\n                He didn’t know exactly how much electrical work he was talking about, what\n        size conduits, didn’t know how - - if he ran across the roof, how wide the supports\n        were going to have to be, how many supports there would be or anything like that at\n        that particular time.\n\nMr. Apple testified: “I told him we could do the work on a cost-plus basis and we would treat him\nright.” No specific figures were discussed and Mr. Apple and Mr. Cleaver never discussed the\nnumber of pitch pockets to be installed. Mr. Apple stated: “We didn’t talk a nail-down figure of any\nkind. I just told him cost plus, I’d treat him right, and that was it.” Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Apple never\ndiscussed what cost plus meant. Mr. Apple testified that Mr. Cleaver did not tell him that he could\ntrench for $1,800, and never asked that the price be kept under a certain amount. The conversation\nbetween the two men lasted approximately three to five minutes and Mr. Apple did not have any\nfurther conversations with Mr. Cleaver after that day. Mr. Apple could not remember if he talked\nto Mr. Parris about the conversation with Mr. Cleaver before the work was done.\n\n                  Charles Ronald Hall, an estimator for J.D. Helton Roofing, a competitor of Plaintiff’s,\ntestified at trial. Mr. Hall reviewed details regarding the project at Pleasant Grove School including\nphotographs that depicted the work on the roof. Mr. Hall testified that he understood the work that\nwas done as:\n\n        a two-step process. One, the roof had an existing rubber roof on it and the 45 posts\n        had to be put in place, which meant cutting 45 holes through the existing roof,\n        removing insulation down to the deck, fastening those and then putting everything\n        back, flashing it to where it doesn’t leak until he actually came and did the tear-off\n        later.…That’s the first step. And then once Randy actually tore the roof off, after all\n        of this was put in place, as I understand it, with a Garland roof system, they were very\n        specific about how they wanted their pitch pans in and flashed, and he went over that\n        in detail with me too. We talked about, you know, how it needed to be done to meet\n        the Garland specifications.\n\n               Mr. Hall gave an estimate: “[f]or the pitch pans we were looking at $150, but that’s\nthe second step. The first step was the temporary 45 places that were potential roof leaks where\nthese post penetrations were, and I estimated that at $100 apiece,” for a total of $250 per pitch pan.\nMr. Hall admitted that although he has been to the Pleasant Grove School, he has not gone up to the\nroof. Mr. Hall opined that four man-hours per pitch pan is reasonable and that the charge for the\namount of materials on the invoice is reasonable. Mr. Hall testified that J.D. Helton could not have\ndone this job for $1,800, and that he would have charged more for the labor than was charged.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\f                Gary Douglas Cleaver testified about why Defendant did not trench, or run the\nconduits underground. He stated: “When I got to the job site and I seen that [Plaintiff] had their tar\nkettle, their dumpsters, materials and everything was completely blocking the whole alleyway right\nthere.”\n\n               Mr. Cleaver also testified regarding his conversation with Mr. Apple stating:\n\n       That conversation with Mr. Apple, as I told him, I said, the reason we’re standing on\n       the roof right here is because I’ve got one of two ways of doing this. I can either\n       trench it underground, and you’ll have to get all your equipment and move it to\n       another place. If you’ll look at this drawing right here, there was no other place.\n       School was going on. This was in January. This was not in the summer.\n\n               School was going on. Teachers were parking in the area. There was only - -\n       we had tight quarters. We were on penalty. We had to get the phasing done on the\n       job. I had to get my conduits from this point (indicating) to this point (indicating)\n       and not try to slow Mr. Parris or anybody else down in the process. All I was trying\n       to do was help.…I told Mr. Apple, in order for us to do this trenching and go\n       underground where he would have to move all of his equipment, which somebody\n       show me where they could put it on this property besides right there where it was, I\n       told him, instead of interrupting him and causing him a delay to close his window on\n       getting his work finished that I had the option of running this across the roof right\n       here.\n\n              I told him I had an $1,800 figure that it would cost me in doing the trenching\n       and coming up the building an going back inside the building as opposed to if he\n       wanted to put pitch pockets and me put stands down through her to run the conduits,\n       I would do that. And at that point right there, we discussed it.\n\n               I told him, I said, can you do it for $1,800?\n\n              He said, I don’t think it will be that much, was the very exact words the man\n       told me.\n\n              And I told him, from that point on we would go - - I said, if you see that it’s\n       going to cost any more, would you please give me a call?\n\n               He said, yes, I will.\n\nMr. Cleaver testified: “Cost plus was never discussed. That was never discussed between me and\nHenry Apple.” Mr. Cleaver heard nothing further from Plaintiff until Defendant received the\ninvoice. Defendant never received anything showing a breakdown of materials or hours worked on\nthis project.\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                Mr. Cleaver testified that there were several inaccuracies in Mr. Parris’ testimony.\nMr. Cleaver testified there were only 40 pitch pockets not 45 as Plaintiff claims. Mr. Cleaver\nproduced bills for the materials used to make the pitch pockets dated in January and February of\n2002, in support of this testimony. Mr. Cleaver also stated: “I’m kind of confused because they keep\ntalking about there was an existing rubber roof, and they roof I walked across wasn’t a rubber roof.\nI mean, it was an old tar and gravel roof, built up tar and gravel.”\n\n                Mr. Cleaver testified that he does expect to pay Plaintiff for the work, but that he\nthrew the invoice in the trash can. He admitted that he does not know if the amount Plaintiff charged\nfor materials or for labor is reasonable or not.\n\n                After trial, the Trial Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order finding and\nholding, inter alia:\n\n       There is no enforceable contract between Parris and SCR. Parris expected to charge\n       for its services and be paid by SCR. Further, SCR expected to pay Parris something\n       for the waterproofing of the penetrations. Parris provided valuable services to SCR,\n       which received and benefited (sic) from these services. It would be unjust for SCR\n       to have received the benefit without paying for the services.\n\n                                               ***\n\n               The court has noticed that Mr. Parris had no specific records for the cost-plus\n       as is customary in the industry.…It appears his testimony about the number of pitch\n       pockets and the number of man hours per pitch pocket is erroneous. Mr. Parris\n       answered initially that a markup of 10-15% is normal but then said his was 40% on\n       materials.…The only specific materials used on the job and identified by the job\n       foreman was (sic) 1 gallon of quick prime, 2 tubes of N/P-1 and one roll of 5\" tape.\n       According to Trial Exhibit 5, the 1 gallon of quick prime cost $20.00; 2 tubes of N/P-\n       1 was $10.00 and 1 roll of 5\" tape was $105.00. Thus, the “segregated” or “itemized\n       cost” was $135.00 and not $3,234.00. Apparently Parris had the other materials at\n       the job site for the roofing work and did not have to order new or many different\n       supplies for the pitch pocket job. Usually, Parris also had employees on the site who\n       could do the work for SCR.\n\n               The court notes that quantum meruit is an equitable remedy. Parris does not\n       have nearly as much equity on its side as does SCR. However, SCR is not without\n       blame. In its initial answer, SCR denied any agreement with Parris. In the Answer\n       to the Amended Complaint, SCR stated it had an agreement with Parris that the\n       charge would not exceed $1,800.00. All in all, Mr. Cleaver’s testimony was more\n       credible. Parris certainly did not follow good business practices by specifying in\n       separate records its labor costs for this job for SCR.\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f                  The court has determined that Parris should receive judgment against SCR\n        for $3,613.50. The court arrived at this figure by allowing labor costs of $3,150.00\n        (1/2 of the billed amount), materials of $135.00, which total $3,285.00, and 10% of\n        that figure for overhead and profit. Thus, judgment will be entered for Parris against\n        SCR for $3,613.50. Although the judgment amount is less than Parris’ bill (or costs,\n        if Mr. Cleaver’s testimony about his telephone call is correct), the judgment amount\n        is still twice as high as SCR wanted to pay. It is because of the court’s strong feeling\n        that Mr. Cleaver tried to limit the cost to $1,800.00 that the testimony of Ronald Hall\n        is not being used. In other words, Parris did not “do SCR right.”\n\nPlaintiff appeals to this Court.\n\n                                              Discussion\n\n                Although not stated exactly as such, Plaintiff raises two issues on appeal: 1) whether\nthe Trial Court erred in calculating the reasonable value of the work; and, 2) whether the Trial Court\nerred in disregarding the testimony of Plaintiff’s expert witness regarding the reasonable value of\nthe work. Neither party takes issue with the Trial Court’s holding that no enforceable contract\nexisted between Plaintiff and Defendant and that quantum meruit is the appropriate remedy.\n\n                Our review is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of correctness\nof the findings of fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise. Tenn.\nR. App. P. 13(d); Bogan v. Bogan, 60 S.W.3d 721, 727 (Tenn. 2001). A trial court's conclusions of\nlaw are subject to a de novo review with no presumption of correctness. S. Constructors, Inc. v.\nLoudon County Bd. of Educ., 58 S.W.3d 706, 710 (Tenn. 2001).\n\n                We first will consider whether the Trial Court erred in calculating the reasonable\nvalue of the work. Plaintiff argues, in large part, that the Trial Court erred in calculating the labor\nand materials costs despite “undisputed evidence” and in “derogation of the factors to be considered\nin establishing a quantum meruit recovery.” Plaintiff argues that it produced proof of the reasonable\nvalue of the work both through the testimony of Mr. Parris and the testimony of Mr. Hall. Mr. Parris\ntestified regarding the time and materials used, the method used to arrive at the total invoice price,\nand Plaintiff’s usual and customary charges. Mr. Hall opined that Plaintiff’s charges were\nreasonable and that it would have cost his company, one of Plaintiff’s competitors, even more to\nperform the same work. Plaintiff argues that Defendant produced no evidence that the labor and\nmaterials charges billed by Plaintiff were unreasonable and “introduced no evidence whatsoever as\nto the reasonable value of the services performed by [Plaintiff].” Plaintiff also argues that the Trial\nCourt incorrectly multiplied the number of pitch pans installed by eight man-hours instead of the\nfour man-hours that Mr. Parris testified it took to install each pitch pan and that the Trial Court failed\nto accurately consider the amount of materials Plaintiff used on the job.\n\n                In Castelli v. Lien, this Court explained:\n\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\f              Liability under quantum meruit is based on a legally implied promise to pay\n       a reasonable amount for goods or services received. Thus, quantum meruit\n       recoveries are limited to the actual value of the goods or services, not their contract\n       price. Courts will not award quantum meruit recoveries without some proof of the\n       reasonable value of the goods or services, but the required proof may be an\n       estimation of the value of the goods and services.\n\nCastelli v. Lien, 910 S.W.2d 420, 427-28 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) (citations omitted). “Tennessee law\nis clear that an award in quantum meruit is not to be determined by the value of the services to the\none who performs the services, but instead, should be based on the value of the benefit conferred.”\nJohnson v. Hunter, No. M2000-03099-COA-R3-CV, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 795, at *18-19 (Tenn.\nCt. App. Oct. 25, 2001), no appl. perm. appeal filed (emphasis in original).\n\n                Plaintiff relies upon, Nations Rent of Tennessee, Inc. v. Lange, which provides that\nin a suit for quantum meruit:\n\n               The reasonable value of goods and services may be proven in several ways.\n       The party seeking to recover in quantum meruit can explain the method used to arrive\n       at a base fee and markup. Additionally, proof as to reasonable value can be obtained\n       from other professionals or experienced workers in that field.\n\nNations Rent of Tennessee, Inc. v. Lange, No. M2001-02368-COA-R3-CV, M2001-02360-COA-R3-\nCV, M2001-02366-COA-R3-CV, 2002 Tenn. App. LEXIS 799, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2002),\nno appl. perm. appeal filed. These listed methods, however, are not mandatory or exclusive.\n\n                We note that the Trial Court specifically found Mr. Cleaver’s testimony to be more\ncredible. On appeal, we defer to the Trial Court’s credibility determinations. The record on appeal\nreveals that Defendant could have achieved its objective of re-routing the electrical conduit by an\nalternative method, i.e., trenching rather than going over the roof, for $1,800. Thus, the benefit to\nDefendant of having the electrical conduit re-routed as it was is $1,800. Given this, there is no need\nto resort to using another method of calculating the reasonable value of the work. The reasonable\nvalue of the work as measured by the benefit to Defendant is $1,800, as the Defendant could have\nachieved its objective at a cost of $1,800.\n\n                Although the Trial Court awarded a judgment $3,613.50, Defendant does not argue\non appeal that the Trial Court erred in awarding the judgment in this amount. Therefore, we need\nnot address whether it was error for the Trial Court to award a judgment in this amount rather than\na lesser amount. We affirm in its entirety the Trial Court’s December 23, 2005 Memorandum\nOpinion and Order awarding Plaintiff $3,613.50.\n\n                Our resolution of the first issue pretermits the necessity of considering Plaintiff’s\nsecond issue.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                           Conclusion\n\n               The judgment of the Trial Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the Trial\nCourt for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed against the Appellant,\nParris Roofing & Sheetmetal Co., and its surety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      ___________________________________\n                                                      D.

Thompson, Cleveland, Tennessee for the Appellant, Parris Roofing & Sheetmetal Co.\n\nErskine P. Mabee, Chattanooga, Tennessee for the Appellee, SCR Electric, Inc.\n\f                                              OPINION\n\n                                             Background\n\n\n               Plaintiff and Defendant were subcontractors working on a renovation project at the\nPleasant Grove School in Dalton, Georgia. Plaintiff had a contract with the general contractor to re-\nroof the school, and Defendant was handling the electrical work on the project.\n\n                A problem arose with the plans for the project and instead of routing the electrical\nwork through the building, Defendant was forced to find another way to route the electrical work.\nDefendant had two options, route the electrical conduit underground by trenching, or run it over the\nroof. Gary Douglas Cleaver, co-owner and president of Defendant, and Henry Apple, Plaintiff’s\nvice-president and estimator, met on the job site to discuss the situation. As a result of this\nconversation, Plaintiff performed work that included installing pitch pans so that Defendant could\nrun the electrical work across the roof.\n\n                After completion of the work, Plaintiff submitted an invoice to Defendant in the\namount of $10,828.00, for “Manufacturing and Installing 45 extra pitch pockets for Pleasant Grove\nSchool.” Defendant did not pay this invoice. After telephone conversations failed to resolve the\ndispute, Plaintiff sued Defendant seeking payment. The case was tried without a jury.\n\n                 David Randall Parris, president and owner of Plaintiff, testified at trial. Mr. Parris\ntestified there was no written contract to cover the work at issue and that he was not involved in the\nconversation between Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Apple. Mr. Parris testified that pursuant to the\nconversation between Mr. Apple and Mr. Cleaver, Plaintiff agreed: “To temporarily waterproof the\npipe supports that they were putting in the roof. And then as we got in the process of tearing off and\nreroofing, we had to do a permanent repair, a new application on it.” Mr. Parris explained that\nDefendant would make a penetration or hole in the roof and then\n\n       We had to put down a layer of mastic plastic roof cement, spread it out, put the pitch\n       pan in, set it in this plastic roof cement and put screws in all the corners, come back\n       and put another layer of mastic plastic roof cement around the whole thing, and then\n       come back with another layer of this material as such (indicating), and then as it\n       lapses on the corners you put more plastic, you know, roof cement on each corner.\n\nMr. Parris further explained\n\n       we would do a temporary repair on these type supports, which involved, you know,\n       bringing it - - it had a rubber roof on it. We had to bring the rubber back in, fill in the\n       void around the pipe if there was a void there, bring the rubber back around it, put\n       a new piece of what we call a five-inch tape, which would be glued to the existing\n       old rubber, and tighten it up around the pipe.…[Then] we had to go on with our\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f        roofing project, which meant tearing the old existing roof off and dispose the debris.\n        You know, we had to work across all these conduits and so forth. Then we had to\n        come back after we had the old roof torn off and install a new roof, which consisted\n        of two layers of insulation and two plies of, you know, felt mopped in in hot asphalt,\n        and then attach this white roof cap sheet.\n\n                 Mr. Parris testified that installing a pitch pan is a two man operation and would\ngenerally take one man-hour to install the temporary pitch pan and three more hours to install the\npermanent one for a total of four man-hours per pitch pan. Plaintiff typically charges $35 per man-\nhour for work of this type, and Plaintiff billed Defendant for 180 man-hours at $35 per hour. Mr.\nParris testified that Plaintiff did not keep records of the actual man-hours and who worked them\nbecause “[i]t was an ongoing project. The men worked on it. We’ve done this off and on for years\nof doing this, and we arrived at, you know, this hourly - -.” He explained that ongoing meant that\nthe men were already on the job site doing other things and when Defendant would cut a hole in the\nroof they would inform Plaintiff’s men who would then go over and patch it. Mr. Parris admitted\nthat the labor charge is not the actual time spent on each pitch pocket but rather a standard charge:\n“That was arrived at from 40-some-odd years of being in the business and coming up with how much\nit takes labor-wise to do a pitch pan.” Plaintiff has no records of the actual time spent on each pitch\npocket. Mr. Parris admitted that he was on the job site “maybe once a week” and that his job\nforeman never told him how much time it took to actually install each pitch pocket.\n\n                Mr. Parris testified that the invoice submitted to Defendant included a $3,234 charge\nfor materials, a 40% profit on the materials, and the labor charge for 180 hours. The invoice does\nnot contain a breakdown of any of the charges, but rather simply states the total amount due. When\nasked, Mr. Parris admitted that during his deposition he testified that normally Plaintiff uses a figure\nof cost, plus 10 or 15%. He further admitted that he testified during his deposition that it is\nPlaintiff’s normal procedure when working on a cost-plus basis to provide invoices for materials and\ntime records if a customer requests them. Plaintiff did not provide invoices for materials and time\nrecords to Defendant because, Mr. Parris testified: “They never asked for it.” Mr. Parris also\nadmitted that after his phone conversation with Mr. Cleaver regarding the dispute about the price,\nhe was “trying to come up with another number.”\n\n                 An exhibit was introduced at trial that Plaintiff testified represented the cost\ncalculations used to arrive at the total invoice price. The exhibit lists materials including 5 rolls of\nmembrane, 25 buckets of roof cement, 45 pitch pans, 29 gallons of pourable sealer, aluminum\nfibrated coating, 1 gallon of quick primer, 2 tubes of NP-1 caulking, and 1 roll of 5\" seam tape. Mr.\nParris admitted that he testified during his deposition that the only material costs that his job foreman\nturned in for the patchwork were one gallon of quick prime, NP-1, and one roll of 5\" tape.\nEverything else that Plaintiff listed as a material cost on the exhibit is just an estimate. Mr. Parris\nstated: “It’s an accurate estimate.…The part that I was emphasizing there, that’s all that he turned\nin. If he had turned in any more, it would have probably tripled that amount.…He didn’t turn it in,\nso it wasn’t on the billing.” Mr. Parris testified that hard costs included in the total invoice price\nincluded workmen’s compensation of approximately twenty-five percent per dollar, general liability\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fof approximately eight percent, state unemployment, FICA, and Medicare. Plaintiff pays its\nemployees an average of $15 per hour.\n\n               Mr. Parris testified that installing the pitch pans:\n\n       added more labor to my contract that I already had that I couldn’t get anything else\n       out of, plus the fact that - - anytime there’s a roof problem, it’s around a roof\n       penetration. Ninety-nine percent of the time it’s around a roof penetration. So we’ve\n       installed 45 penetrations here, and we had to warrant the roof. Anytime we can get\n       anything off of the roof, we want it off of the roof.\n\nHe further stated:\n\n       If those penetrations had not been in that area, we would have just walked right\n       through [the re-roofing job]. It probably added, in that particular area, added 75\n       percent more labor to have to work around - - not counting the pitch pans, just to\n       work around them, and tearing off the exiting (sic) roof and installing a new roof.\n\n                When asked about any equipment that Plaintiff had on the job site that might have\ninterfered with Defendant’s ability to trench for the electrical conduit, Mr. Parris testified that\nPlaintiff had an asphalt kettle and a dumpster near the building that they could have moved in\napproximately thirty to forty-five minutes without slowing them down on their portion of the project.\nPlaintiff’s other materials were located in an area that would not have obstructed Defendant’s ability\nto trench and those materials could have been moved in three to four hours if necessary.\n\n             Mr. Parris testified that when he had not heard anything for several months after\nsending Defendant the invoice, he called Mr. Cleaver. Mr. Parris stated:\n\n       I just called and inquired, you know, about it, and he informed me that he had an\n       agreement with Mr. Apple, that it was $1,800. I didn’t know anything about the\n       $1,800. You know, Mr. Apple was no longer employed at the time, so I - - you\n       know, we went from there going back and forth trying to resolve the issue.\n\nMr. Parris never spoke with any of Defendant’s people before the work was done and never spoke\nwith Mr. Apple about the work at issue in this case prior to the work being done.\n\n                Henry Lee Apple, Jr. testified regarding his meeting on the job site with Mr. Cleaver.\nHe testified that the architect’s representative introduced Mr. Cleaver to Mr. Apple and then left and\nthat no one but Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Apple participated in the conversation that led to the work at\nissue in this case. Mr. Apple testified that Mr. Cleaver:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f        said he was going to have to - - since he couldn’t run it the way that it was shown, he\n        was either going to have to go underground or he was going to go across the roof, one\n        of the two.\n\n                He didn’t know exactly how much electrical work he was talking about, what\n        size conduits, didn’t know how - - if he ran across the roof, how wide the supports\n        were going to have to be, how many supports there would be or anything like that at\n        that particular time.\n\nMr. Apple testified: “I told him we could do the work on a cost-plus basis and we would treat him\nright.” No specific figures were discussed and Mr. Apple and Mr. Cleaver never discussed the\nnumber of pitch pockets to be installed. Mr. Apple stated: “We didn’t talk a nail-down figure of any\nkind. I just told him cost plus, I’d treat him right, and that was it.” Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Apple never\ndiscussed what cost plus meant. Mr. Apple testified that Mr. Cleaver did not tell him that he could\ntrench for $1,800, and never asked that the price be kept under a certain amount. The conversation\nbetween the two men lasted approximately three to five minutes and Mr. Apple did not have any\nfurther conversations with Mr. Cleaver after that day. Mr. Apple could not remember if he talked\nto Mr. Parris about the conversation with Mr. Cleaver before the work was done.\n\n                  Charles Ronald Hall, an estimator for J.D. Helton Roofing, a competitor of Plaintiff’s,\ntestified at trial. Mr. Hall reviewed details regarding the project at Pleasant Grove School including\nphotographs that depicted the work on the roof. Mr. Hall testified that he understood the work that\nwas done as:\n\n        a two-step process. One, the roof had an existing rubber roof on it and the 45 posts\n        had to be put in place, which meant cutting 45 holes through the existing roof,\n        removing insulation down to the deck, fastening those and then putting everything\n        back, flashing it to where it doesn’t leak until he actually came and did the tear-off\n        later.…That’s the first step. And then once Randy actually tore the roof off, after all\n        of this was put in place, as I understand it, with a Garland roof system, they were very\n        specific about how they wanted their pitch pans in and flashed, and he went over that\n        in detail with me too. We talked about, you know, how it needed to be done to meet\n        the Garland specifications.\n\n               Mr. Hall gave an estimate: “[f]or the pitch pans we were looking at $150, but that’s\nthe second step. The first step was the temporary 45 places that were potential roof leaks where\nthese post penetrations were, and I estimated that at $100 apiece,” for a total of $250 per pitch pan.\nMr. Hall admitted that although he has been to the Pleasant Grove School, he has not gone up to the\nroof. Mr. Hall opined that four man-hours per pitch pan is reasonable and that the charge for the\namount of materials on the invoice is reasonable. Mr. Hall testified that J.D. Helton could not have\ndone this job for $1,800, and that he would have charged more for the labor than was charged.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\f                Gary Douglas Cleaver testified about why Defendant did not trench, or run the\nconduits underground. He stated: “When I got to the job site and I seen that [Plaintiff] had their tar\nkettle, their dumpsters, materials and everything was completely blocking the whole alleyway right\nthere.”\n\n               Mr. Cleaver also testified regarding his conversation with Mr. Apple stating:\n\n       That conversation with Mr. Apple, as I told him, I said, the reason we’re standing on\n       the roof right here is because I’ve got one of two ways of doing this. I can either\n       trench it underground, and you’ll have to get all your equipment and move it to\n       another place. If you’ll look at this drawing right here, there was no other place.\n       School was going on. This was in January. This was not in the summer.\n\n               School was going on. Teachers were parking in the area. There was only - -\n       we had tight quarters. We were on penalty. We had to get the phasing done on the\n       job. I had to get my conduits from this point (indicating) to this point (indicating)\n       and not try to slow Mr. Parris or anybody else down in the process. All I was trying\n       to do was help.…I told Mr. Apple, in order for us to do this trenching and go\n       underground where he would have to move all of his equipment, which somebody\n       show me where they could put it on this property besides right there where it was, I\n       told him, instead of interrupting him and causing him a delay to close his window on\n       getting his work finished that I had the option of running this across the roof right\n       here.\n\n              I told him I had an $1,800 figure that it would cost me in doing the trenching\n       and coming up the building an going back inside the building as opposed to if he\n       wanted to put pitch pockets and me put stands down through her to run the conduits,\n       I would do that. And at that point right there, we discussed it.\n\n               I told him, I said, can you do it for $1,800?\n\n              He said, I don’t think it will be that much, was the very exact words the man\n       told me.\n\n              And I told him, from that point on we would go - - I said, if you see that it’s\n       going to cost any more, would you please give me a call?\n\n               He said, yes, I will.\n\nMr. Cleaver testified: “Cost plus was never discussed. That was never discussed between me and\nHenry Apple.” Mr. Cleaver heard nothing further from Plaintiff until Defendant received the\ninvoice. Defendant never received anything showing a breakdown of materials or hours worked on\nthis project.\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                Mr. Cleaver testified that there were several inaccuracies in Mr. Parris’ testimony.\nMr. Cleaver testified there were only 40 pitch pockets not 45 as Plaintiff claims. Mr. Cleaver\nproduced bills for the materials used to make the pitch pockets dated in January and February of\n2002, in support of this testimony. Mr. Cleaver also stated: “I’m kind of confused because they keep\ntalking about there was an existing rubber roof, and they roof I walked across wasn’t a rubber roof.\nI mean, it was an old tar and gravel roof, built up tar and gravel.”\n\n                Mr. Cleaver testified that he does expect to pay Plaintiff for the work, but that he\nthrew the invoice in the trash can. He admitted that he does not know if the amount Plaintiff charged\nfor materials or for labor is reasonable or not.\n\n                After trial, the Trial Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order finding and\nholding, inter alia:\n\n       There is no enforceable contract between Parris and SCR. Parris expected to charge\n       for its services and be paid by SCR. Further, SCR expected to pay Parris something\n       for the waterproofing of the penetrations. Parris provided valuable services to SCR,\n       which received and benefited (sic) from these services. It would be unjust for SCR\n       to have received the benefit without paying for the services.\n\n                                               ***\n\n               The court has noticed that Mr. Parris had no specific records for the cost-plus\n       as is customary in the industry.…It appears his testimony about the number of pitch\n       pockets and the number of man hours per pitch pocket is erroneous. Mr. Parris\n       answered initially that a markup of 10-15% is normal but then said his was 40% on\n       materials.…The only specific materials used on the job and identified by the job\n       foreman was (sic) 1 gallon of quick prime, 2 tubes of N/P-1 and one roll of 5\" tape.\n       According to Trial Exhibit 5, the 1 gallon of quick prime cost $20.00; 2 tubes of N/P-\n       1 was $10.00 and 1 roll of 5\" tape was $105.00. Thus, the “segregated” or “itemized\n       cost” was $135.00 and not $3,234.00. Apparently Parris had the other materials at\n       the job site for the roofing work and did not have to order new or many different\n       supplies for the pitch pocket job. Usually, Parris also had employees on the site who\n       could do the work for SCR.\n\n               The court notes that quantum meruit is an equitable remedy. Parris does not\n       have nearly as much equity on its side as does SCR. However, SCR is not without\n       blame. In its initial answer, SCR denied any agreement with Parris. In the Answer\n       to the Amended Complaint, SCR stated it had an agreement with Parris that the\n       charge would not exceed $1,800.00. All in all, Mr. Cleaver’s testimony was more\n       credible. Parris certainly did not follow good business practices by specifying in\n       separate records its labor costs for this job for SCR.\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f                  The court has determined that Parris should receive judgment against SCR\n        for $3,613.50. The court arrived at this figure by allowing labor costs of $3,150.00\n        (1/2 of the billed amount), materials of $135.00, which total $3,285.00, and 10% of\n        that figure for overhead and profit. Thus, judgment will be entered for Parris against\n        SCR for $3,613.50. Although the judgment amount is less than Parris’ bill (or costs,\n        if Mr. Cleaver’s testimony about his telephone call is correct), the judgment amount\n        is still twice as high as SCR wanted to pay. It is because of the court’s strong feeling\n        that Mr. Cleaver tried to limit the cost to $1,800.00 that the testimony of Ronald Hall\n        is not being used. In other words, Parris did not “do SCR right.”\n\nPlaintiff appeals to this Court.\n\n                                              Discussion\n\n                Although not stated exactly as such, Plaintiff raises two issues on appeal: 1) whether\nthe Trial Court erred in calculating the reasonable value of the work; and, 2) whether the Trial Court\nerred in disregarding the testimony of Plaintiff’s expert witness regarding the reasonable value of\nthe work. Neither party takes issue with the Trial Court’s holding that no enforceable contract\nexisted between Plaintiff and Defendant and that quantum meruit is the appropriate remedy.\n\n                Our review is de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of correctness\nof the findings of fact of the trial court, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.

Plaintiff argues, in large part, that the Trial Court erred in calculating the labor\nand materials costs despite “undisputed evidence” and in “derogation of the factors to be considered\nin establishing a quantum meruit recovery.” Plaintiff argues that it produced proof of the reasonable\nvalue of the work both through the testimony of Mr. Parris and the testimony of Mr. Hall. Mr. Parris\ntestified regarding the time and materials used, the method used to arrive at the total invoice price,\nand Plaintiff’s usual and customary charges. Mr. Hall opined that Plaintiff’s charges were\nreasonable and that it would have cost his company, one of Plaintiff’s competitors, even more to\nperform the same work. Plaintiff argues that Defendant produced no evidence that the labor and\nmaterials charges billed by Plaintiff were unreasonable and “introduced no evidence whatsoever as\nto the reasonable value of the services performed by [Plaintiff].” Plaintiff also argues that the Trial\nCourt incorrectly multiplied the number of pitch pans installed by eight man-hours instead of the\nfour man-hours that Mr. Parris testified it took to install each pitch pan and that the Trial Court failed\nto accurately consider the amount of materials Plaintiff used on the job.\n\n                In Castelli v. Lien, this Court explained:\n\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\f              Liability under quantum meruit is based on a legally implied promise to pay\n       a reasonable amount for goods or services received. Thus, quantum meruit\n       recoveries are limited to the actual value of the goods or services, not their contract\n       price. Courts will not award quantum meruit recoveries without some proof of the\n       reasonable value of the goods or services, but the required proof may be an\n       estimation of the value of the goods and services.\n\nCastelli v. Lien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1637954\"><a href=\"/opinion/1637954/castelli-v-lien/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427-28 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) (citations omitted). “Tennessee law\nis clear that an award in quantum meruit is not to be determined by the value of the services to the\none who performs the services, but instead, should be based on the value of the benefit conferred.”\nJohnson v. Hunter, No. M2000-03099-COA-R3-CV, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 795, at *18-19 (Tenn.\nCt. App. Oct. 25, 2001), no appl. perm. appeal filed (emphasis in original).\n\n                Plaintiff relies upon, Nations Rent of Tennessee, Inc. v. Lange, which provides that\nin a suit for quantum meruit:\n\n               The reasonable value of goods and services may be proven in several ways.\n       The party seeking to recover in quantum meruit can explain the method used to arrive\n       at a base fee and markup. Additionally, proof as to reasonable value can be obtained\n       from other professionals or experienced workers in that field.\n\nNations Rent of Tennessee, Inc. v. Lange, No. M2001-02368-COA-R3-CV, M2001-02360-COA-R3-\nCV, M2001-02366-COA-R3-CV, 2002 Tenn. App. LEXIS 799, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2002),\nno appl. perm. appeal filed. These listed methods, however, are not mandatory or exclusive.\n\n                We note that the Trial Court specifically found Mr. Cleaver’s testimony to be more\ncredible. On appeal, we defer to the Trial Court’s credibility determinations. The record on appeal\nreveals that Defendant could have achieved its objective of re-routing the electrical conduit by an\nalternative method, i.e., trenching rather than going over the roof, for $1,800. Thus, the benefit to\nDefendant of having the electrical conduit re-routed as it was is $1,800. Given this, there is no need\nto resort to using another method of calculating the reasonable value of the work. The reasonable\nvalue of the work as measured by the benefit to Defendant is $1,800, as the Defendant could have\nachieved its objective at a cost of $1,800.\n\n                Although the Trial Court awarded a judgment $3,613.50, Defendant does not argue\non appeal that the Trial Court erred in awarding the judgment in this amount. Therefore, we need\nnot address whether it was error for the Trial Court to award a judgment in this amount rather than\na lesser amount. We affirm in its entirety the Trial Court’s December 23, 2005 Memorandum\nOpinion and Order awarding Plaintiff $3,613.50.\n\n                Our resolution of the first issue pretermits the necessity of considering Plaintiff’s\nsecond issue.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                           Conclusion\n\n               The judgment of the Trial Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the Trial\nCourt for collection of the costs below. The costs on appeal are assessed against the Appellant,\nParris Roofing & Sheetmetal Co., and its surety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      ___________________________________\n                                                      D.
