Plaintiff James Maben (“Maben”) appeals from the judgment\nentered by the district court granting Defendant Troy Thelen’s (“Thelen”) motion for summary\njudgment and dismissing the case. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM in part and\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                 Page 2\n\n\nREVERSE in part the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case to the district court\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\nI.     Factual History\n\n       Maben is an incarcerated prisoner in Michigan. On October 19, 2015, Maben was in the\nprison’s food service line for lunch. The cafeteria server provided Maben with half a serving of\nfood, dumping out the other half. Maben “politely ask[ed]” the cafeteria server why he did not\nreceive a full serving. (R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 79.) The server responded that he\n“was doing as told” and directed Maben to speak to a designated cafeteria employee. (Id.)\nMaben raised the issue with that employee, who instructed Maben to speak with his supervisor at\nthe end of the line. Before Maben could speak to the supervisor, Thelen, a prison guard, “began\nyelling” and said “shut the fuck up if you wanna eat, your [sic] not gonna change anything\nBitch.” (Id.) The supervisor “acknowledged the severely inadequate portion,” took Maben’s\ntray, and gave him the full portion of food. (Id.)\n\n       Thelen then came over to Maben and demanded his identification number. Thelen said\n“if you’re going to complain then you’re going to get a misconduct for it.” (R. 1, Complaint,\nPageID # 5.) Thelen then issued Maben a misconduct ticket for creating a disturbance. The\ncafeteria “was dead silent in amazement with defendant Thelen’s behavior.” (R. 14, Maben\nAffidavit, PageID # 79.) Maben claimed that he “[n]ever” became disruptive, but that Thelen\n“became bel[l]iger[e]nt[,] swearing and yelling, which did [frighten him], [and] humiliate [him]\nin front of 100 plus other prisoners.” (Id.) Maben was “embarrassed, demeaned, and humiliated\nby Defendant Thel[e]n’s statements, and felt that he could no longer comply with the grievance\nprocedure if he was going to be treated in this manner.” (R. 1, Complaint, PageID # 5.) He has\n“been forced to endure shortened portions ever since, as a result of Thelen[’]s retaliation [and]\nout of fear of future retaliation.” (R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 80.)\n\n       On October 22, 2015, a misconduct hearing was held.            The hearing officer found\nThelen’s statement “more credible” because his report was “clear, detailed, and unequivocal.”\n(R. 13-2, Misconduct Report, PageID # 67.) The hearing officer chose not to view video footage\n\f No. 17-1289                                    Maben v. Thelen                             Page 3\n\n\nof the incident, concluding that it would be irrelevant because there was no sound. Maben was\nfound guilty of “Class II misconduct” for “creating a disturbance” and lost privileges for seven\ndays as punishment. (Id.)\n\nII.    Procedural History\n\n       On February 16, 2016, Maben brought a pro se action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nThelen in his official and individual capacities.          He alleged that Thelen unconstitutionally\nretaliated against him “for participating in the protected activity of attempting to comply with the\nMichigan Department of Corrections1 Grievance Policy.” (R. 1, Complaint, PageID # 3.)\n\n       On April 25, 2016, Thelen filed a motion for summary judgment. Thelen argued that the\ncourt should dismiss the official capacity claim because of the Eleventh Amendment. He also\nargued that Maben’s First Amendment retaliation claim failed because he “did not engage in any\nprotected activity and whatever treatment he received was not attributable to any protected\nactivity.” (R. 13, Thelen MSJ, PageID # 47.) Finally, Thelen argued that he was protected by\nqualified immunity because Maben had not demonstrated that Thelen violated clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights. Maben filed a pro se response to Thelen’s motion.\n\n       On March 1, 2017, the district court granted Thelen’s motion for summary judgment, and\ndismissed the case. The district court concluded that Maben’s retaliation claim was barred based\non two grounds. First, the court concluded that “the dispute as to what really occurred was\nalready adjudicated by the MDOC in the course of its grievance process” and that those factual\nfindings were entitled to preclusive effect in federal court. (R. 20, Opinion, PageID # 120.)\nSecond, the court concluded that the finding of guilt at Maben’s misconduct hearing\n“checkmates” his retaliation claim, citing to the Eighth Circuit’s “checkmate doctrine.” (Id.)\nHenderson v. Baird, 29 F.3d 464, 469 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n       On March 17, 2017, Maben timely filed his notice of appeal. On appeal, Maben argues\nthat the district court incorrectly gave preclusive effect to the factual findings at Maben’s\nmisconduct hearing and incorrectly applied the “checkmate doctrine.” Thelen argues that this\n\n\n       1\n           Hereinafter referred to as “MDOC.”\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                  Page 4\n\n\npanel should affirm the judgment of the district court on the alternative grounds that Maben has\nfailed to establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, that Thelen is entitled to qualified\nimmunity, and that the Eleventh Amendment bars Maben’s suit for damages against Thelen in\nhis official capacity.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\nI.      Preclusive Effect of Factual Findings Made at the Misconduct Hearing\n\n                                         Standard of Review\n\n        This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Gillis v.\nMiller, 845 F.3d 677, 683 (6th Cir. 2017). Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n        The district court incorrectly found that Maben “failed to establish a First Amendment\nretaliation claim” because “the dispute as to what really occurred was already adjudicated by the\nMDOC in the course of its grievance process,” and “federal courts give preclusive effect to the\nfactual findings at misconduct hearings like Maben’s.” (R. 20, Opinion, PageID # 119–20.) The\nfactual findings made at Maben’s minor misconduct hearing do not have preclusive effect in\nfederal court and do not bar Maben’s claim.\n\n        To determine whether we must give preclusive effect to “factfinding from Michigan\nprison hearings,” we look to four requirements, all of which must be met: (1) the state agency\n“act[ed] in a ‘judicial capacity’”; (2) the hearing officer “resolved a disputed issue of fact that\nwas properly before it”; (3) the prisoner “had an adequate opportunity to litigate the factual\ndispute”; and, (4) if these other three requirements are met, we must “give the agency’s finding\nof fact the same preclusive effect it would be given in state courts.” Peterson v. Johnson,\n714 F.3d 905, 911–13 (6th Cir. 2013) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In Peterson, the Court considered, as a matter of first impression, whether a hearing\nofficer’s factual determination at a Michigan major misconduct hearing has preclusive effect in\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                   Page 5\n\n\nlitigation brought by a prisoner under § 1983. Id. at 908, 911. The Court concluded that,\nbecause all four requirements were met, the “hearing officer’s factual finding that [the prisoner]\nwas the one who grabbed [the officer’s] hand precludes a contrary finding in federal court.” Id.\nat 917. In Roberson v. Torres, the Court considered the same issue, and identified the four\nrequirements listed above. 770 F.3d 398, 403–04 (6th Cir. 2014). The Court said that Peterson\ndoes not mean that “any factual findings by a hearing officer in a major-misconduct hearing in a\nMichigan prison are to be accorded preclusive effect.” Id. at 404. “Peterson is not a blanket\nblessing on every factual finding in a major-misconduct hearing.” Id.\n\n        Indeed, the question of preclusion cannot be resolved categorically, as it turns on\n        case-specific factual questions such as what issues were actually litigated and\n        decided, and whether the party to be precluded had sufficient incentives to litigate\n        those issues and a full and fair opportunity to do so—not just in theory, but in\n        practice. It likewise turns on the court’s sense of justice and equity, which may\n        require a case-by-case analysis of surrounding circumstances.\n\nId. at 404–05 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The Court declined to decide the\npreclusion question, and remanded the case to the district court to consider the argument for the\nfirst time. Id. at 405. The Court instructed the district court to “give particular attention to the\nfairness and accuracy of the factual findings made by the major-misconduct hearing officer.” Id.\nThe Court advised that “[n]umerous inquiries may be relevant to the district court’s analysis,”\nlike “why the hearing officer refused to review the alleged video of the incident, whether the\nhearing officer provided a sufficient and reasonable basis for her factual findings, and whether\nthe testimony of other witnesses corroborated the accounts provided by either [the prisoner] or\n[the officer].” Id. at 405.\n\n        This Court has not considered whether a hearing officer’s factual determinations at a\nminor misconduct hearing have preclusive effect in subsequent § 1983 litigation. However, in\nthis case, we conclude that they do not because neither the first nor third requirements of the\nPeterson test have been met.\n\n        Under the first requirement, the state agency must have been acting in a “judicial\ncapacity.” An administrative agency “acts in a judicial capacity when it hears evidence, gives\nthe parties an opportunity to brief and argue their versions of the facts, and gives the parties an\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                    Page 6\n\n\nopportunity to seek court review of any adverse findings.” Peterson, 714 F.3d at 912 (alteration\nomitted) (quoting Herrera v. Churchill McGee, LLC, 680 F.3d 539, 547 (6th Cir. 2012)).\n\n       In Peterson, the Court found that the “hearing officer considered evidence that was put\ninto the record by [the prisoner] and [the officer], allowed the parties to argue their version of the\nfacts at a formal hearing, and issued a written final decision that, had [the prisoner] chosen to\nappeal, could have been subject to direct review in state court.” Id. The Court noted the “whole\nraft of judicial-type protections available to Michigan prisoners in major misconduct hearings.”\nId. This included that “the accused prisoner must receive an ‘evidentiary hearing without undue\ndelay,’ be given ‘reasonable notice’ of the hearing, receive ‘an opportunity to present evidence’\nand to present ‘oral and written arguments on issues of fact,’ and be allowed to submit ‘rebuttal\nevidence’ to the evidence against him.” Id. at 912 (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS § 791.252(a), (b),\n(d), (e)). With regard to evidence, “any objections to the evidence’s admissibility must be\nresolved and explained on the record,” id. (citing § 791.252(g)), and “all admitted evidence must\nbe made part of the record,” id. (citing § 791.252(h)). “[T]he presiding hearing officer must be\nan attorney, [who] can ‘administer an oath or affirmation to a witness’ and ‘take depositions’ as a\npart of his fact-finding role, must be impartial and must recuse if the accused files a motion\nsuccessfully showing bias, must abstain from ex parte communications with the accused prisoner\nand the accusing Department of Corrections staff, and must make an official record of the\nhearing at which he presides.”       Id. at 912–13 (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS §§ 791.251(6);\n791.252(f), (i), (j); 791.253). Finally, the “hearing officer must conclude the process by issuing a\nwritten final decision that is based solely on the preponderance of the evidence in the record, and\nthat decision must be immediately mailed to the accused prisoner,” who “has a right to appeal it\nwithin the agency and then . . . to state court.”         Id. at 913 (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS\n§§ 791.252(k), 791.254, 791.255).\n\n       We can easily distinguish the protections provided in a major misconduct hearing from\nthe barebones protections to which Maben was entitled at his minor misconduct hearing.\n“A prisoner charged with minor misconduct shall be provided a fact-finding hearing conducted\nin accordance with R 791.3310.” MICH. ADMIN. CODE R. 791.5501. “A prisoner shall receive\nsufficient written notice of the purpose of a fact-finding hearing sufficiently prior to the hearing\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                     Page 7\n\n\nto allow preparation of a response.” MICH. ADMIN. CODE R. 791.3310. The notice includes “[a]\ncopy of any disciplinary report or other information regarding circumstances giving rise to the\nhearing.” Id. During the fact-finding hearing, a prisoner is entitled to “be present and speak on\nhis or her own behalf” and to “receive a copy of any department document specifically relevant\nto the issue before the hearing officer, unless disclosure of the document would be a threat to the\norder and security of the facility or the safety of an individual.” Id. The prisoner may waive the\nfact-finding hearing. Id. “Unless the prisoner waives the Class II hearing and pleads guilty, an\ninformal hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Administrative Rule 791.3310.” (Maben\nBr. at SA7.) “Only Resident Unit Managers, Captains, and/or Lieutenants designated by the\nWarden shall conduct the hearing. The staff person conducting the hearing shall have had no\nprior direct involvement in the matter at issue.”        (Id.)   The prisoner is not entitled to an\ninvestigation by the hearing investigator. “The hearing officer shall make a summary report of\nthe hearing and decision or recommendation.” MICH. ADMIN. CODE R. 791.3310. There is no\njudicial review in state court of a minor misconduct report. Martin v. Stine, 542 N.W.2d 884,\n886 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995).\n\n       Clearly, the procedural protections that are available for major misconducts are not the\nsame as those available for minor misconducts. And a number of the protections the Peterson\nCourt found significant are absent here, like that there be a formal hearing, that there be a written\nfinal decision that is subject to direct appeal in state court, or that the prisoner be able to present\nwritten arguments or submit rebuttal evidence. 714 F.3d at 912. Because there were insufficient\njudicial-type protections available to Maben in his minor misconduct hearing, MDOC was not\nacting in a “judicial capacity” during Maben’s minor misconduct hearing.\n\n       Under the third requirement, the prisoner must have had an adequate opportunity to\nlitigate the factual dispute. In Peterson, the Court’s analysis under this requirement mirrored its\nanalysis under the first. The Court found the prisoner had an adequate opportunity to litigate for\nthe reasons discussed under the first factor based on “a plethora of statutory protections”\navailable to prisoners. 714 F.3d at 913. For the same reasons noted above, Maben did not have\nan adequate opportunity to litigate his case. Furthermore, just like the Court in Roberson, we\nfind it relevant that the hearing officer refused to view the video of the incident, despite Maben’s\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                Page 8\n\n\nrequest that the officer watch it. Even though the video contained no audio, it would have helped\nthe hearing officer decide whether Maben was calm (as Maben claims) or whether he created a\ndisturbance (as Thelen claims).\n\n       Consequently, because the four-factor test as set out in Peterson and Roberson is not met\nin this case, the factual findings made in Maben’s minor misconduct hearing do not have\npreclusive effect. Maben can dispute the factual findings of the minor misconduct hearing and\ncan seek a contrary finding in federal court. The district court erred by concluding otherwise.\nAccordingly, we reverse this ruling of the district court.\n\nII.    “Checkmate Doctrine”\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.           Gillis,\n845 F.3d at 683. Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n       The district court concluded that the finding of guilt at Maben’s misconduct hearing\nbarred Maben’s claim, citing to the Eighth Circuit’s “checkmate doctrine.” (R. 20, Opinion,\nPageID # 120.) The “checkmate doctrine” provides that when a prison body finds that a prisoner\nhas committed “an actual violation of prison rules” and the “finding [is] based on some evidence\nof the violation, the finding essentially checkmates [the] retaliation claim.” Henderson, 29 F.3d\nat 469; Hartsfield v. Nichols, 511 F.3d 826, 829 (8th Cir. 2008) (restating the Henderson test\nwithout using “essentially” as a qualifier); see also O’Bryant v. Finch, 637 F.3d 1207, 1215\n(11th Cir. 2011).\n\n       Other circuits have rejected this categorical bar on a retaliation claim. Watson v. Rozum,\n834 F.3d 417, 426 (3d Cir. 2016) (“[A] plaintiff can make out a retaliation claim even though the\ncharge against him may have been factually supported.”); Bruce v. Ylst, 351 F.3d 1283, 1289–90\n(9th Cir. 2003); Woods v. Smith, 60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir. 1995) (“Although we decline to\n\f No. 17-1289                                  Maben v.

Lane, 857 F.2d 1139, 1145 (7th Cir. 1988).\n\n        This Court has never adopted the “checkmate doctrine” in a published opinion.2 We now\nreject that doctrine. A finding of guilt at a prison misconduct hearing does not act as an absolute\nbar to a prisoner’s First Amendment retaliation claim.\n\n        The “checkmate doctrine” is contrary to and irreconcilable with the burden-shifting\nframework that this Court has adopted when analyzing a prisoner’s retaliation claim. This Court\nhas repeatedly held that to succeed on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show\nthat:\n\n        (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken\n        against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from\n        continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between\n        elements one and two—that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part\n        by the plaintiff’s protected conduct.\n\nThaddeus-X v. Blatter, 175 F.3d 378, 394 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Under the third element,\n“the subjective motivation of the defendants is at issue.” Id. at 399. “The analysis of motive in\nretaliation claims is well-developed”—“[o]nce the plaintiff has met his burden of establishing\nthat his protected conduct was a motivating factor behind any harm, the burden of production\nshifts to the defendant.” Id. (citing Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n429 U.S. 274 (1977)). “If the defendant can show that he would have taken the same action in\nthe absence of the protected activity, he is entitled to prevail on summary judgment.” Id.\nA defendant must make this showing by a preponderance of the evidence. King v. Zamiara,\n680 F.3d 686, 709 (6th Cir. 2012). And officers can point to “disruptive” behavior as a reason\nfor taking action. Id.\n\n        Adopting the “checkmate doctrine” as articulated by the Eighth Circuit would render our\nCircuit’s Mount Healthy burden-shifting framework superfluous. Guilt of misconduct may be\n\n\n        2\n        This Court has applied the “checkmate doctrine” in various unpublished opinions. See, e.g., Patterson v.\nGodward, 505 F. App’x 424, 425 (6th Cir. 2012); Jackson v. Madery, 158 F. App’x 656, 662 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\f No. 17-1289                               Maben v. Thelen                             Page 10\n\n\nrelevant summary judgment evidence within that framework, but it does not automatically bar a\nplaintiff’s claim. Adopting the “checkmate doctrine” would also improperly lower a defendant’s\nevidentiary burden. Under the Mount Healthy and Thaddeus-X analysis, a defendant must show\nby a preponderance of the evidence “that he would have taken the same action in the absence of\nthe protected activity.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399; King, 680 F.3d at 694. This is a greater\nburden than the “checkmate doctrine’s” “some evidence” standard. Henderson, 29 F.3d at 469.\n\n        Furthermore, in the motion to dismiss context, we have explicitly rejected the argument\nthat an “administrative determination that [the prisoner] actually committed the . . . misconduct\nprecludes him from being able to establish retaliation.” Thomas v. Eby, 481 F.3d 434, 440 (6th\nCir. 2007). The Court found in Thomas that “guilt of misconduct” did not negate an allegation\nof protected conduct and rejected MDOC’s argument that the prisoner could not “show causation\nwithout first demonstrating that the misconduct charge was ultimately resolved in his favor.” Id.\nat 440–42. We see no reason why we would apply a different rule depending on whether a case\nis at the motion to dismiss stage, or at the summary judgment stage.\n\n        In all, we cannot reconcile the “checkmate doctrine” with this Court’s First Amendment\nretaliation case law and we will not adopt a doctrine that would flout this Court’s precedent.\nHolding otherwise would also “unfairly tempt corrections officers to enrobe themselves and their\ncolleagues in what would be an absolute shield against retaliation claims.” Woods, 60 F.3d at\n1165. A prisoner “deserves the opportunity to try to show that the reasons given for disciplining\nhim were a pretext for the prison officials’ retaliatory animus.” Orebaugh v. Caspari, 910 F.2d\n526, 529–30 (8th Cir. 1990) (Heaney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). On summary\njudgment, the traditional burden-shifting framework announced in Mount Healthy and Thaddeus-\nX applies.\n\n        Consequently, the district court erred when it concluded that MDOC’s finding of\nmisconduct “checkmates” Maben’s retaliation claim. Maben’s claim is not barred based merely\non the fact he was found guilty of creating a disturbance at a misconduct hearing. Accordingly,\nwe reverse this ruling of the district court.\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                 Page 11\n\n\nIII.   First Amendment Retaliation\n\n                                      Standard of Review\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.             Gillis,\n845 F.3d at 683. Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of showing that no genuine issues of\nmaterial fact exist. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). The moving party must\ndemonstrate the “basis for its motion, and identify[] those portions of the pleadings, depositions,\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it\nbelieves demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Id. at 323 (internal\ncitations and quotation marks omitted). The nonmoving party “must set forth specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n250 (1986) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The reviewing court must then\ndetermine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a\njury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Id. at 251–52.\nA court should view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving\nparty. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).\n\n                                            Analysis\n\n       Thelen argues that this Court should affirm the grant of summary judgment in his favor\nbecause “Maben failed to establish the elements of a retaliation claim.” (Thelen Br. at 7.) He\nargues that Maben was not engaged in constitutionally protected activity, and that even if he\nwere, that he violated a legitimate prison regulation and was no longer engaged in protected\nactivity once he became disruptive. Thelen also argues that issuing a minor misconduct ticket\ndoes not rise to the level of “adverse action.” Finally, he argues that Maben has failed to show\nthat the misconduct was motivated by Maben’s protected activity.\n\n       A First Amendment retaliation claim has three elements:\n\n       (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken\n       against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                 Page 12\n\n\n         continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between\n         elements one and two—that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part\n         by the plaintiff’s protected conduct.\n\nThaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 394.\n\n         A.     Protected Conduct\n\n         As to the first element, “[a]n inmate has an undisputed First Amendment right to file\ngrievances against prison officials on his own behalf.” Herron v. Harrison, 203 F.3d 410, 415\n(6th Cir. 2000); Violett v. Reynolds, 76 F. App’x 24, 27 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Filing grievances\nthrough the inmate grievance mechanism is protected conduct.”). However, the right to file\ngrievances is protected only insofar as the grievances are not “frivolous.” Herron, 203 F.3d at\n415. “Abusive or manipulative use of a grievance system would not be protected conduct,”\nKing, 680 F.3d at 699, and an “inmate cannot immunize himself from adverse administrative\naction by prison officials merely by filing a grievance or a lawsuit and then claiming that\neverything that happens to him is retaliatory,” Spies v. Voinovich, 48 F. App’x 520, 525 (6th Cir.\n2002).\n\n         Viewing the facts and drawing all inferences in Maben’s favor, Maben has presented\nsufficient evidence that he was engaged in protected conduct. According to Maben’s account, he\nreceived half the serving of food that he was entitled to receive. He then “politely” and “quietly”\nraised the inadequacy of his food portion to a line worker, a cafeteria worker, and a supervisor.\n(R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 79–80.) It was Thelen who interrupted that process by\nyelling at Maben, “charg[ing]” over to Maben to demand his identification, and issuing him a\nmisconduct ticket.      (Id. at # 79.)     Despite Thelen’s actions, the cafeteria supervisor\n“acknowledged the severely inadequate portion,” took Maben’s tray, and gave him the correct\nserving. (Id.) By complaining about the insufficient quantity of food he had received, Maben\nwas pursuing a grievance about prison conditions and seeking redress of that grievance.\nAccordingly, Maben was engaged in protected conduct.\n\n         Some cases in this Circuit appear to suggest that a prisoner’s grievance is frivolous when\nthe underlying grievance itself is de minimis. Ziegler v. State of Michigan, 90 F. App’x 808, 810\n(6th Cir. 2004) (finding a grievance frivolous when the prisoner complained that the prison\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                  Page 13\n\n\nofficer should “not be able to conduct a non-invasive pat-down search” of her); White-Bey v.\nGriggs, 43 F. App’x 792, 794 (6th Cir. 2002) (finding grievances that “concerned being required\nto use a typewriter rather than a computer, and being required to sit quietly in defendant’s office\nafter being told again that there was no computer available for him to use” to be frivolous and\nnot to “rise to the level of protected conduct”); Scott v. Kilchermann, 230 F.3d 1359, at *1–2 (6th\nCir. 2000) (finding a grievance frivolous when the inmate complained that he had been subject to\nverbal abuse); Thaddeus-X v. Love, 215 F.3d 1327, at *2–3 (6th Cir. 2000) (finding a prisoner’s\nthreat to file a grievance against an officer for “eating waffles at a prison guard desk,” which was\nagainst prison policy, “patently frivolous as the defendant’s conduct had no adverse impact on\n[the prisoner]”). We have also described a non-frivolous grievance as a “legitimate” grievance.\nPasley v. Conerly, 345 F. App’x 981, 985 (6th Cir. 2009). Whether there is in fact a de minimis\nexception to prisoner grievances is irrelevant to the disposition of this case.        Maben was\ncomplaining about the adequacy of his food, and we refuse to say that a complaint about one of\nthe major requirements of life is a frivolous or de minimis grievance. This is especially true\nwhere Maben appears to have been correct: the cafeteria worker “acknowledged the severely\ninadequate portion” and corrected the error. (R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 79.)\n\n       Further, this is true even though Maben pursued his grievance orally, rather than in\nwriting. An inmate has a right to file “non-frivolous” grievances against prison officials on his\nown behalf, whether written or oral. Mack v. Warden Loretto FCI, 839 F.3d 286, 299 (3d Cir.\n2016) (“[The prisoner’s] oral grievance to [the prison officer] regarding the anti-Muslim\nharassment he endured at work constitutes protected activity under the First Amendment.”);\nPearson v. Welborn, 471 F.3d 732, 741 (7th Cir. 2006) (“[W]e decline to hold that legitimate\ncomplaints lose their protected status simply because they are spoken.”); see also Pasley, 345 F.\nApp’x at 985 (finding that a prisoner engaged in protected conduct by threatening to file a\ngrievance).\n\n       “Nothing in the First Amendment itself suggests that the right to petition for redress of\ngrievances only attaches when the petitioning takes a specific form.” Holzemer v. City of\nMemphis, 621 F.3d 512, 521 (6th Cir. 2010) (finding that a conversation constituted protected\npetitioning activity) (quoting Pearson, 471 F.3d at 741). While we recognize concerns about\n\f No. 17-1289                                    Maben v. Thelen                                          Page 14\n\n\nopening the floodgates to frivolous prisoner lawsuits, “we are not persuaded that an oral\ngrievance should not receive constitutional protection solely because it is lodged by a prisoner as\nopposed to a civilian.” Mack, 839 F.3d at 298. A “prisoner[] retain[s] the constitutional right to\npetition the government for the redress of grievances.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987)\n(citing Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969)). But this right is limited insofar as the petitioning\nactivity is “inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives\nof the corrections system.” Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974). “[A]lthough certain\ntypes of ‘petitioning’ would be obviously inconsistent with imprisonment (marches or group\nprotests, for example),” we do not think that Maben’s oral complaint about prison conditions\n“fall[s] into that category.” Pearson, 471 F.3d at 741.\n\n        Moreover, MDOC’s own grievance policy required that prisoners raise their grievances\norally with staff before they file a formal written grievance, and a grievance may even be\ndismissed if “[t]he grievant did not attempt to resolve the issue with the staff member involved\nprior to filing the grievance.” (R. 14, Grievance Policy, PageID # 85). Maben has maintained\nthat he was “attempting to resolve [his] issue with the staff involved prior to writing a grievance”\nand “engaged in the grievance process according to [MDOC] policy.”3 (R. 14, Maben Affidavit,\nPageID # 79–80.) It would be an unfair and illogical result for prisons to require initial oral\ncomplaints, but then be able to argue that a retaliation claim fails because the prisoner filed an\noral, rather than written, complaint. Maben should not be punished for complying with prison\npolicy, nor should prison officials be allowed to retaliate against Maben for making an oral\ngrievance.\n\n        Finally, Thelen argues that if Maben was initially engaged in protected activity, “once\nMaben became disruptive, he violated a legitimate prison regulation and was no longer engaged\nin protected conduct.” (Thelen Br. at 10.) We have previously said that “if a prisoner violates a\nlegitimate prison regulation, he is not engaged in ‘protected conduct,’ and cannot proceed\nbeyond step one.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 395. But at this stage of the litigation, we must\n“consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all\n\n        3\n          Even at his misconduct hearing, Maben maintained that he was “trying to resolve the issue, before filing a\ngrievance like Policy told [him].” (R. 13-2, Misconduct Report, PageID # 67.)\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                   Page 15\n\n\nreasonable inferences in that party’s favor,” McKay v. Federspiel, 823 F.3d 862, 866 (6th Cir.\n2016), and Maben swore in his affidavit that “[n]ever did [he] become disruptive.” (R. 14,\nMaben Affidavit, PageID # 79.) Thelen appears to argue only that his version of events is true,\nand Maben’s is false, which he cannot do at this stage.\n\n       B.      Adverse Action\n\n        As to the second element, “[a]n adverse action is one that would ‘deter a person of\nordinary firmness’ from the exercise of the right at stake.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 396.\n“Whether a retaliatory action is sufficiently severe to deter a person of ordinary firmness from\nexercising his or her rights is a question of fact.” Bell v. Johnson, 308 F.3d 594, 603 (6th Cir.\n2002). However, some adverse actions are so de minimis that they do not rise to the level of a\nconstitutionally cognizable injury. Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 396 (citing Ingraham v. Wright,\n430 U.S. 651, 674 (1977)). “[T]his threshold is intended to weed out only inconsequential\nactions, and is not a means whereby solely egregious retaliatory acts are allowed to proceed past\nsummary judgment.”       Id. at 398.    Indeed, “unless the claimed retaliatory action is truly\n‘inconsequential,’ the plaintiff’s claim should go to the jury.” Bell, 308 F.3d at 603. (citing\nThaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 398); Kennedy v. Bonevelle, 413 F. App’x 836, 840 (6th Cir. 2011)\n(“[O]nly de minimis violations should be dismissed as a matter of law; in general, the\nadverseness question should survive the pleading stage.”).\n\n       When deciding whether the issuance of a misconduct ticket rises to the level of an\nadverse action, we look to both the punishment Maben could have faced and the punishment he\nultimately did face. See Scott v. Churchill, 377 F.3d 565, 572 (6th Cir. 2004) (“[T]he mere\npotential threat of disciplinary sanctions is sufficiently adverse action to support a claim of\nretaliation.”); Brown v. Crowley, 312 F.3d 782, 789 (6th Cir. 2002) (looking to what the prisoner\n“could have been sentenced to . . . if he had been found guilty”). The sanctions that Maben faced\nfor a Class II misconduct included: “[t]oplock (confinement to quarters), not to exceed five\ndays . . . .”; loss of privileges for up to 30 days; assignment of extra duty; and, restitution and/or\ndisgorgement. (Maben Br., Disciplinary Sanctions, SA21; R. 13-2, Misconduct Hearing, PageID\n# 67.) The actual punishment resulting from Maben’s misconduct hearing was loss of privileges\nfor seven days. These privileges included the rights to access exercise facilities, to attend group\n\f No. 17-1289                                Maben v. Thelen                              Page 16\n\n\nmeetings (including Bible class), to use the telephone, to have visitors, to access the general\nlibrary, and to access the activity room.\n\n       In Hill v. Lapin, this Court found that “actions that result in more restrictions and fewer\nprivileges for prisoners are considered adverse.” 630 F.3d 468, 474 (6th Cir. 2010). In Noble v.\nSchmitt, this Court denied qualified immunity where the conduct at issue was that “Defendants\nrestricted his privileges after he filed a considerable number of grievances against them.”\n87 F.3d 157, 162 (6th Cir. 1996). In Harbin-Bey v. Rutter, when concluding that the prisoner\nsuffered no adverse action, the Court noted that the prisoner “did not lose any privileges as a\nresult of the [Notice of Intent to Conduct an Administrative Hearing].” 420 F.3d 571, 579 (6th\nCir. 2005).\n\n       In other cases, we have found sufficiently adverse punishments that were “at least as\nsevere as” the one imposed here, including confiscating legal papers and other property, Bell,\n308 F.3d at 604, subjecting the prisoner to retaliatory cell searches, id., and damaging a\nprisoner’s typewriter, LaFountain v. Harry, 716 F.3d 944, 948–49 (6th Cir. 2013); see also\nWatson v. Rozum, 834 F.3d 417, 423 (3d Cir. 2016) (“[E]ven though his Class I misconduct was\nreduced to a Class II misconduct at his hearing, Watson lost his radio as a result and the Class II\nmisconduct became part of his prison record. This is substantially more than a de minimis\nconsequence for someone confined in a prison cell.”); Barr v. Diguglielmo, 348 F. App’x 769,\n774 (3d Cir. 2009) (finding an adverse action where a prisoner “was prohibited from\nparticipating in any prison activities (including religious activities . . .)”); Reynolds v. Green,\n25 F. App’x 256, 261 (6th Cir. 2001) (finding an adverse action where a prisoner was transferred\nfrom a facility where he could “come and go with permission,” to a facility where he could not);\nHall v. Sutton, 755 F.2d 786, 787–88 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that an inmate stated a First\nAmendment retaliation claim based upon the confiscation of his tennis shoes). But see Ingram v.\nJewell, 94 F. App’x 271, 273 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding that a loss of fourteen days of privileges\ndid not constitute adverse action).\n\n       In all, the deprivation of privileges is hardly “inconsequential”—indeed, they are all that\nprisoners really have. Furthermore, the issuance of the minor misconduct ticket subjected\nMaben to the risk of even more significant sanctions, including confinement to his cell, which is\n\f No. 17-1289                                     Maben v. Thelen                                          Page 17\n\n\ncertainly not “inconsequential.” See Hill, 630 F.3d at 474. Because this case did not involve de\nminimis retaliatory action, this question cannot be resolved as a matter of law. It is for the\nfactfinder to decide whether the deprivation of those privileges “poses a sufficient deterrent\nthreat to be actionable.” Bell, 308 F.3d at 603.\n\n         C.       Causation\n\n         Under the third element, “[u]sually, the question of causation is a factual issue to be\nresolved by a jury, and may be satisfied by circumstantial evidence.” Harris v. Bornhorst,\n513 F.3d 503, 519–20 (6th Cir. 2008) (citing Hartsel v. Keys, 87 F.3d 795, 803 (6th Cir. 1996)).\n“Nonetheless, a court may grant summary judgment even in a causation inquiry, where it is\nwarranted.” Hartsel, 87 F.3d at 803 (citing Langford v. Lane, 921 F.2d 677, 683–84 (6th Cir.\n1991)). “Once the plaintiff has met his burden of establishing that his protected conduct was a\nmotivating factor behind any harm, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.” Thaddeus-\nX, 175 F.3d at 399 (citing Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. 274). “If the defendant can show that he\nwould have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity, he is entitled to prevail\non summary judgment.” Id.\n\n         Maben has presented evidence that, after receiving less than a standard serving of food,\nhe “politely” and “quietly” complained about the quantity of food. (R. 14, Maben Affidavit,\nPageID # 79–80.) Maben said that he “[n]ever” became disruptive, but that it was Thelen who\nbegan yelling at Maben, who “became bel[l]iger[e]nt,” and who issued Maben a misconduct\nticket. (Id. at # 79)\n\n         Three separate witnesses corroborate Maben’s account of the events.4 For example,\nRussell Govett stated that Thelen “continued yelling abuses [at Maben] and said something about\n\n\n         4\n          These statements were included in Maben’s pro se response to Thelen’s motion for summary judgment.\nThelen suggests that the “unsworn statements vary in their compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746.” (Thelen Br. at 10\nn.1.) Section 1746 provides that an unsworn declaration may be used as a sworn statement if it is “subscribed” by a\nperson “as true under penalty of perjury, and dated.” 28 U.S.C. § 1746. Luke Carlson’s statement is signed and\ndated “under the penalty of perjury” and attested “to the best of my knowledge.” (R. 14, Statements, PageID # 87.)\nRussell Govett’s statement is signed and dated “under penalty of perjury, that the afore mentioned [sic] is both true\nand correct.” (Id. at # 88.) Anthony Post’s statement is sworn “under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is both\ntrue and correct,” it is signed, but it is not dated. (Id. at # 89.) Under § 1746, then, it seems the only problematic\nstatement is Post’s because it does not contain a date.\n\f No. 17-1289                                   Maben v. Thelen                                          Page 18\n\n\nhim being a bitch and he would not change anything anyway.” (R. 14, Govett Statement, PageID\n# 88.) Govett also stated that Thelen “asked Mr. Maben for his ID and wrote him a ticket for\ncomplaining.” (Id.) He said that “[a]t no time during the incident did Mr. Maben get loud or\nspeak in more than a conversational tone.” (Id.)\n\n        Additionally, there is a suspicious temporal proximity between Maben’s grievance and\nthe alleged retaliatory action. This Court has “previously considered the temporal proximity\nbetween protected conduct and retaliatory acts as creating an inference of retaliatory motive.”\nKing, 680 F.3d at 695–96 (citations omitted); Muhammad v. Close, 379 F.3d 413, 417–18 (6th\nCir. 2004) (“[T]emporal proximity alone may be significant enough to constitute indirect\nevidence of a causal connection so as to create an inference of retaliatory motive.” (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, Thelen issued the misconduct ticket immediately\nafter Maben raised the issue of inadequate food portions and as Maben was trying to remedy the\nsituation with the food supervisor.5\n\n        Based upon this evidence, we conclude that Maben has introduced sufficient evidence for\na reasonable jury to find that Thelen’s “adverse action was motivated at least in part by\n[Maben’s] protected conduct.” Brown, 312 F.3d at 790. Consequently, the burden shifts to\nThelen. Id.\n\n        Thelen’s only response is that the issuance of a misconduct ticket was not causally\nconnected to any constitutionally protected activity. Instead, he argues that he intervened not\nbecause Maben was engaged in protected activity, but because Maben was causing a disturbance.\nIn his affidavit, Thelen denied retaliating against Maben.                 Again, however, Maben “hotly\ndisputes” that “Maben was causing a disturbance.” (Maben Rep. Br. at 23.) Thelen has “done\nlittle more than deny the allegations put forth by” Maben, which is insufficient to meet his\nburden. Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399.\n\n\n\n        5\n          Maben also alleges in his pro se complaint that Thelen said “if you’re going to complain then you’re\ngoing to get a misconduct for it.” (R. 1, Complaint, PageID # 5.) Immediately after making that threat to punish\nMaben for pursuing the grievance, Maben alleges that Thelen followed through and issued the misconduct ticket.\nAlthough this did not make it into Maben’s affidavit, if true, it would certainly support Maben’s claim that Thelen\nissued the misconduct ticket because of the complaint, and not because Maben created a disturbance.\n\f No. 17-1289                               Maben v. Thelen                               Page 19\n\n\n        In all, then, Maben has introduced sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on\nhis First Amendment retaliation claim.       We therefore decline to affirm the district court’s\ndecision based on this alternate ground.\n\nIV.     Qualified Immunity\n\n                                      Standard of Review\n\n        This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.            Gillis,\n845 F.3d at 683. Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n        Thelen argues that this Court should affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for Thelen on the grounds that Thelen is entitled to qualified immunity. He argues that\n“there is insufficient evidence that his actions violated clearly established law.” (Thelen Br. at\n15.) We think Maben has introduced sufficient evidence of a violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional right.\n\n        Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, “government officials performing discretionary\nfunctions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.”        Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).        To determine whether\ngovernment officials are entitled to qualified immunity, we ask: “First, taken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show that the officer’s conduct\nviolated a constitutional right? Second, is the right clearly established?” Silberstein v. City of\nDayton, 440 F.3d 306, 311 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)).\nCourts may address these two prongs in whichever order they choose. Pearson v. Callahan,\n555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). Plaintiff bears the burden of showing that defendants are not entitled\nto qualified immunity. Chappell v. City Of Cleveland, 585 F.3d 901, 907 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                   Page 20\n\n\n       As to the first prong, as discussed above, Maben has introduced sufficient evidence that\nThelen violated Maben’s constitutional rights. Thelen tries to argue that he “acted because\nMaben was causing a disturbance, not in retaliation, and not because Maben was engaged in any\nprotected activity.” (Thelen Br. at 17.) But “we assume the truth of all record-supported\nallegations by the non-movant,” Bays v. Montmorency Cty., 874 F.3d 264, 268 (6th Cir. 2017)\n(citing Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2017 (2014)), and “under either prong, courts may\nnot resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment,” Tolan v.\nCotton, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 1866 (2014).\n\n       As to the second prong, this Court has repeatedly recognized that if a prison officer\n“retaliated against [a prisoner] for filing grievances,” the “alleged conduct also comprises a\nviolation of clearly established constitutional law.” Noble, 87 F.3d at 162 (citations omitted);\nKing v. Zamiara, 150 F. App’x 485, 493 (6th Cir. 2005) (“Charging an inmate with misconduct\nis an adverse action because serious consequences can flow from erroneous charges.”); Scott,\n377 F.3d at 572 (finding it clearly established that “the false issuance of a misconduct charge is\nunconstitutional retaliation”); Bell, 308 F.3d at 612.\n\n       Thelen further argues that there was no violation of a clearly established right because\nour cases dealing with the false issuance of misconduct charges deal with the issuance of major\nmisconduct charges and not minor misconduct charges. We think Thelen’s preoccupation with\nMDOC’s label of major and minor misconduct is misplaced.               Instead of focusing on that\nclassification, Thelen should focus on the action of retaliating by issuing a misconduct ticket and\nthe penalties that come with being found guilty of misconduct. We have made clear that a prison\nofficer may not undertake adverse actions in retaliation for a prisoner’s exercise of his First\nAmendment rights. Bell, 308 F.3d at 612. We have also made clear that actions comparable in\nseriousness to the ones at issue in this case implicate a prisoner’s First Amendment rights. Id.;\nsee supra III.B. (discussing punishments at least as severe as the one imposed in this case).\nMoreover, the sanctions that may be imposed as a result of minor misconduct share features with\nthe sanctions that may be imposed as a result of major misconduct. For example, a prisoner\nfound guilty of minor misconduct may be confined to their cell for five days and lose any\nvisitation rights or access to any prison facilities, including the library. This shares features with\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                   Page 21\n\n\nadministrative segregation, and we have held that being confined in administrative segregation\nfor five days constituted a sufficiently adverse action. Herron, 203 F.3d at 416. Consequently,\nwe think that a reasonable prison officer would have been aware that issuing a misconduct ticket,\neven a minor misconduct ticket, in retaliation for the inmate’s exercise of his First Amendment\nrights could give rise to constitutional liability. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640\n(1987) (“The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.” (citations omitted)); Bell, 308 F.3d at 612.\n\n       Consequently, we decline Thelen’s invitation to affirm the district court’s decision based\non qualified immunity.\n\nV.     Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.                Gillis,\n845 F.3d at 683. Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n       Thelen argues that as a state officer, the Eleventh Amendment bars Maben’s suit against\nhim in his official capacity.\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment “denies to the federal courts authority to entertain a suit\nbrought by private parties against a state without its consent.” Ford Motor Co. v. Dep’t of\nTreasury of Indiana, 323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945) (citation omitted). “The [Supreme] Court has\nheld that, absent waiver by the State or valid congressional override, the Eleventh Amendment\nbars a damages action against a State in federal court.” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 169\n(1985) (citation omitted). “This bar remains in effect when State officials are sued for damages\nin their official capacity.” Id. (citations omitted). Section 1983 “was not intended to abrogate a\nState’s Eleventh Amendment Immunity.”           Id. at n.17. (citations omitted).     The Eleventh\n\f No. 17-1289                            Maben v. Thelen                                Page 22\n\n\nAmendment, however, does not bar suits for damages against officers in their personal capacity\nunder § 1983. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25–27 (1991).\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment bars Maben’s “official-capacity action for damages” against\nThelen in federal court. See Kentucky, 473 U.S. at 170. However, the Eleventh Amendment\ndoes not bar Maben’s § 1983 claim against Thelen for damages in his personal capacity. See\nHafer, 502 U.S. at 27.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Thelen on\nMaben’s official-capacity claim based on the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the judgment of\nthe district court and REMAND the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\f",

For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM in part and\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                 Page 2\n\n\nREVERSE in part the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case to the district court\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\nI.     Factual History\n\n       Maben is an incarcerated prisoner in Michigan. On October 19, 2015, Maben was in the\nprison’s food service line for lunch. The cafeteria server provided Maben with half a serving of\nfood, dumping out the other half. Maben “politely ask[ed]” the cafeteria server why he did not\nreceive a full serving. (R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 79.) The server responded that he\n“was doing as told” and directed Maben to speak to a designated cafeteria employee. (Id.)\nMaben raised the issue with that employee, who instructed Maben to speak with his supervisor at\nthe end of the line. Before Maben could speak to the supervisor, Thelen, a prison guard, “began\nyelling” and said “shut the fuck up if you wanna eat, your [sic] not gonna change anything\nBitch.” (Id.) The supervisor “acknowledged the severely inadequate portion,” took Maben’s\ntray, and gave him the full portion of food. (Id.)\n\n       Thelen then came over to Maben and demanded his identification number. Thelen said\n“if you’re going to complain then you’re going to get a misconduct for it.” (R. 1, Complaint,\nPageID # 5.) Thelen then issued Maben a misconduct ticket for creating a disturbance. The\ncafeteria “was dead silent in amazement with defendant Thelen’s behavior.” (R. 14, Maben\nAffidavit, PageID # 79.) Maben claimed that he “[n]ever” became disruptive, but that Thelen\n“became bel[l]iger[e]nt[,] swearing and yelling, which did [frighten him], [and] humiliate [him]\nin front of 100 plus other prisoners.” (Id.) Maben was “embarrassed, demeaned, and humiliated\nby Defendant Thel[e]n’s statements, and felt that he could no longer comply with the grievance\nprocedure if he was going to be treated in this manner.” (R. 1, Complaint, PageID # 5.) He has\n“been forced to endure shortened portions ever since, as a result of Thelen[’]s retaliation [and]\nout of fear of future retaliation.” (R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 80.)\n\n       On October 22, 2015, a misconduct hearing was held.            The hearing officer found\nThelen’s statement “more credible” because his report was “clear, detailed, and unequivocal.”\n(R. 13-2, Misconduct Report, PageID # 67.) The hearing officer chose not to view video footage\n\f No. 17-1289                                    Maben v. Thelen                             Page 3\n\n\nof the incident, concluding that it would be irrelevant because there was no sound. Maben was\nfound guilty of “Class II misconduct” for “creating a disturbance” and lost privileges for seven\ndays as punishment. (Id.)\n\nII.    Procedural History\n\n       On February 16, 2016, Maben brought a pro se action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nThelen in his official and individual capacities.          He alleged that Thelen unconstitutionally\nretaliated against him “for participating in the protected activity of attempting to comply with the\nMichigan Department of Corrections1 Grievance Policy.” (R. 1, Complaint, PageID # 3.)\n\n       On April 25, 2016, Thelen filed a motion for summary judgment. Thelen argued that the\ncourt should dismiss the official capacity claim because of the Eleventh Amendment. He also\nargued that Maben’s First Amendment retaliation claim failed because he “did not engage in any\nprotected activity and whatever treatment he received was not attributable to any protected\nactivity.” (R. 13, Thelen MSJ, PageID # 47.) Finally, Thelen argued that he was protected by\nqualified immunity because Maben had not demonstrated that Thelen violated clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights. Maben filed a pro se response to Thelen’s motion.\n\n       On March 1, 2017, the district court granted Thelen’s motion for summary judgment, and\ndismissed the case. The district court concluded that Maben’s retaliation claim was barred based\non two grounds. First, the court concluded that “the dispute as to what really occurred was\nalready adjudicated by the MDOC in the course of its grievance process” and that those factual\nfindings were entitled to preclusive effect in federal court. (R. 20, Opinion, PageID # 120.)\nSecond, the court concluded that the finding of guilt at Maben’s misconduct hearing\n“checkmates” his retaliation claim, citing to the Eighth Circuit’s “checkmate doctrine.” (Id.)\nHenderson v. Baird, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673923\"><a href=\"/opinion/673923/andre-t-henderson-v-david-baird-jointly-and-severally-in-their-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n       On March 17, 2017, Maben timely filed his notice of appeal. On appeal, Maben argues\nthat the district court incorrectly gave preclusive effect to the factual findings at Maben’s\nmisconduct hearing and incorrectly applied the “checkmate doctrine.” Thelen argues that this\n\n\n       1\n           Hereinafter referred to as “MDOC.”\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                  Page 4\n\n\npanel should affirm the judgment of the district court on the alternative grounds that Maben has\nfailed to establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, that Thelen is entitled to qualified\nimmunity, and that the Eleventh Amendment bars Maben’s suit for damages against Thelen in\nhis official capacity.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\nI.      Preclusive Effect of Factual Findings Made at the Misconduct Hearing\n\n                                         Standard of Review\n\n        This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Gillis v.\nMiller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683 (6th Cir. 2017). Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n        The district court incorrectly found that Maben “failed to establish a First Amendment\nretaliation claim” because “the dispute as to what really occurred was already adjudicated by the\nMDOC in the course of its grievance process,” and “federal courts give preclusive effect to the\nfactual findings at misconduct hearings like Maben’s.” (R. 20, Opinion, PageID # 119–20.) The\nfactual findings made at Maben’s minor misconduct hearing do not have preclusive effect in\nfederal court and do not bar Maben’s claim.\n\n        To determine whether we must give preclusive effect to “factfinding from Michigan\nprison hearings,” we look to four requirements, all of which must be met: (1) the state agency\n“act[ed] in a ‘judicial capacity’”; (2) the hearing officer “resolved a disputed issue of fact that\nwas properly before it”; (3) the prisoner “had an adequate opportunity to litigate the factual\ndispute”; and, (4) if these other three requirements are met, we must “give the agency’s finding\nof fact the same preclusive effect it would be given in state courts.” Peterson v. Johnson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911–13 (6th Cir. 2013) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In Peterson, the Court considered, as a matter of first impression, whether a hearing\nofficer’s factual determination at a Michigan major misconduct hearing has preclusive effect in\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v. Thelen                                   Page 5\n\n\nlitigation brought by a prisoner under § 1983. Id. at 908, 911. The Court concluded that,\nbecause all four requirements were met, the “hearing officer’s factual finding that [the prisoner]\nwas the one who grabbed [the officer’s] hand precludes a contrary finding in federal court.” Id.\nat 917. In Roberson v.

The Court said that Peterson\ndoes not mean that “any factual findings by a hearing officer in a major-misconduct hearing in a\nMichigan prison are to be accorded preclusive effect.” Id. at 404. “Peterson is not a blanket\nblessing on every factual finding in a major-misconduct hearing.” Id.\n\n        Indeed, the question of preclusion cannot be resolved categorically, as it turns on\n        case-specific factual questions such as what issues were actually litigated and\n        decided, and whether the party to be precluded had sufficient incentives to litigate\n        those issues and a full and fair opportunity to do so—not just in theory, but in\n        practice. It likewise turns on the court’s sense of justice and equity, which may\n        require a case-by-case analysis of surrounding circumstances.\n\nId. at 404–05 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The Court declined to decide the\npreclusion question, and remanded the case to the district court to consider the argument for the\nfirst time. Id. at 405. The Court instructed the district court to “give particular attention to the\nfairness and accuracy of the factual findings made by the major-misconduct hearing officer.” Id.\nThe Court advised that “[n]umerous inquiries may be relevant to the district court’s analysis,”\nlike “why the hearing officer refused to review the alleged video of the incident, whether the\nhearing officer provided a sufficient and reasonable basis for her factual findings, and whether\nthe testimony of other witnesses corroborated the accounts provided by either [the prisoner] or\n[the officer].” Id. at 405.\n\n        This Court has not considered whether a hearing officer’s factual determinations at a\nminor misconduct hearing have preclusive effect in subsequent § 1983 litigation. However, in\nthis case, we conclude that they do not because neither the first nor third requirements of the\nPeterson test have been met.\n\n        Under the first requirement, the state agency must have been acting in a “judicial\ncapacity.” An administrative agency “acts in a judicial capacity when it hears evidence, gives\nthe parties an opportunity to brief and argue their versions of the facts, and gives the parties an\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                    Page 6\n\n\nopportunity to seek court review of any adverse findings.” Peterson, 714 F.3d at 912 (alteration\nomitted) (quoting Herrera v. Churchill McGee, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799901\"><a href=\"/opinion/799901/herrera-v-churchill-mcgee-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547 (6th Cir. 2012)).\n\n       In Peterson, the Court found that the “hearing officer considered evidence that was put\ninto the record by [the prisoner] and [the officer], allowed the parties to argue their version of the\nfacts at a formal hearing, and issued a written final decision that, had [the prisoner] chosen to\nappeal, could have been subject to direct review in state court.” Id. The Court noted the “whole\nraft of judicial-type protections available to Michigan prisoners in major misconduct hearings.”\nId. This included that “the accused prisoner must receive an ‘evidentiary hearing without undue\ndelay,’ be given ‘reasonable notice’ of the hearing, receive ‘an opportunity to present evidence’\nand to present ‘oral and written arguments on issues of fact,’ and be allowed to submit ‘rebuttal\nevidence’ to the evidence against him.” Id. at 912 (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS § 791.252(a), (b),\n(d), (e)). With regard to evidence, “any objections to the evidence’s admissibility must be\nresolved and explained on the record,” id. (citing § 791.252(g)), and “all admitted evidence must\nbe made part of the record,” id. (citing § 791.252(h)). “[T]he presiding hearing officer must be\nan attorney, [who] can ‘administer an oath or affirmation to a witness’ and ‘take depositions’ as a\npart of his fact-finding role, must be impartial and must recuse if the accused files a motion\nsuccessfully showing bias, must abstain from ex parte communications with the accused prisoner\nand the accusing Department of Corrections staff, and must make an official record of the\nhearing at which he presides.”       Id. at 912–13 (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS §§ 791.251(6);\n791.252(f), (i), (j); 791.253). Finally, the “hearing officer must conclude the process by issuing a\nwritten final decision that is based solely on the preponderance of the evidence in the record, and\nthat decision must be immediately mailed to the accused prisoner,” who “has a right to appeal it\nwithin the agency and then . . . to state court.”         Id. at 913 (citing MICH. COMP. LAWS\n§§ 791.252(k), 791.254, 791.255).\n\n       We can easily distinguish the protections provided in a major misconduct hearing from\nthe barebones protections to which Maben was entitled at his minor misconduct hearing.\n“A prisoner charged with minor misconduct shall be provided a fact-finding hearing conducted\nin accordance with R 791.3310.” MICH. ADMIN. CODE R. 791.5501. “A prisoner shall receive\nsufficient written notice of the purpose of a fact-finding hearing sufficiently prior to the hearing\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                     Page 7\n\n\nto allow preparation of a response.” MICH. ADMIN. CODE R. 791.3310. The notice includes “[a]\ncopy of any disciplinary report or other information regarding circumstances giving rise to the\nhearing.” Id. During the fact-finding hearing, a prisoner is entitled to “be present and speak on\nhis or her own behalf” and to “receive a copy of any department document specifically relevant\nto the issue before the hearing officer, unless disclosure of the document would be a threat to the\norder and security of the facility or the safety of an individual.” Id. The prisoner may waive the\nfact-finding hearing. Id. “Unless the prisoner waives the Class II hearing and pleads guilty, an\ninformal hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Administrative Rule 791.3310.” (Maben\nBr. at SA7.) “Only Resident Unit Managers, Captains, and/or Lieutenants designated by the\nWarden shall conduct the hearing. The staff person conducting the hearing shall have had no\nprior direct involvement in the matter at issue.”        (Id.)   The prisoner is not entitled to an\ninvestigation by the hearing investigator. “The hearing officer shall make a summary report of\nthe hearing and decision or recommendation.” MICH. ADMIN. CODE R. 791.3310. There is no\njudicial review in state court of a minor misconduct report. Martin v. Stine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1237032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1237032/martin-v-stine/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n886 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995).\n\n       Clearly, the procedural protections that are available for major misconducts are not the\nsame as those available for minor misconducts. And a number of the protections the Peterson\nCourt found significant are absent here, like that there be a formal hearing, that there be a written\nfinal decision that is subject to direct appeal in state court, or that the prisoner be able to present\nwritten arguments or submit rebuttal evidence. 714 F.3d at 912. Because there were insufficient\njudicial-type protections available to Maben in his minor misconduct hearing, MDOC was not\nacting in a “judicial capacity” during Maben’s minor misconduct hearing.\n\n       Under the third requirement, the prisoner must have had an adequate opportunity to\nlitigate the factual dispute. In Peterson, the Court’s analysis under this requirement mirrored its\nanalysis under the first. The Court found the prisoner had an adequate opportunity to litigate for\nthe reasons discussed under the first factor based on “a plethora of statutory protections”\navailable to prisoners. 714 F.3d at 913. For the same reasons noted above, Maben did not have\nan adequate opportunity to litigate his case. Furthermore, just like the Court in Roberson, we\nfind it relevant that the hearing officer refused to view the video of the incident, despite Maben’s\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                Page 8\n\n\nrequest that the officer watch it. Even though the video contained no audio, it would have helped\nthe hearing officer decide whether Maben was calm (as Maben claims) or whether he created a\ndisturbance (as Thelen claims).\n\n       Consequently, because the four-factor test as set out in Peterson and Roberson is not met\nin this case, the factual findings made in Maben’s minor misconduct hearing do not have\npreclusive effect. Maben can dispute the factual findings of the minor misconduct hearing and\ncan seek a contrary finding in federal court. The district court erred by concluding otherwise.\nAccordingly, we reverse this ruling of the district court.\n\nII.    “Checkmate Doctrine”\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.

The “checkmate doctrine” provides that when a prison body finds that a prisoner\nhas committed “an actual violation of prison rules” and the “finding [is] based on some evidence\nof the violation, the finding essentially checkmates [the] retaliation claim.” Henderson, 29 F.3d\nat 469; Hartsfield v.

This Court\nhas repeatedly held that to succeed on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show\nthat:\n\n        (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken\n        against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from\n        continuing to engage in that conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between\n        elements one and two—that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part\n        by the plaintiff’s protected conduct.\n\nThaddeus-X v.

(citing Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.

And officers can point to “disruptive” behavior as a reason\nfor taking action.

Adopting the “checkmate doctrine” would also improperly lower a defendant’s\nevidentiary burden. Under the Mount Healthy and Thaddeus-X analysis, a defendant must show\nby a preponderance of the evidence “that he would have taken the same action in the absence of\nthe protected activity.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399; King, 680 F.3d at 694. This is a greater\nburden than the “checkmate doctrine’s” “some evidence” standard. Henderson, 29 F.3d at 469.\n\n        Furthermore, in the motion to dismiss context, we have explicitly rejected the argument\nthat an “administrative determination that [the prisoner] actually committed the . . . misconduct\nprecludes him from being able to establish retaliation.” Thomas v.

The Court found in Thomas that “guilt of misconduct” did not negate an allegation\nof protected conduct and rejected MDOC’s argument that the prisoner could not “show causation\nwithout first demonstrating that the misconduct charge was ultimately resolved in his favor.” Id.\nat 440–42. We see no reason why we would apply a different rule depending on whether a case\nis at the motion to dismiss stage, or at the summary judgment stage.\n\n        In all, we cannot reconcile the “checkmate doctrine” with this Court’s First Amendment\nretaliation case law and we will not adopt a doctrine that would flout this Court’s precedent.\nHolding otherwise would also “unfairly tempt corrections officers to enrobe themselves and their\ncolleagues in what would be an absolute shield against retaliation claims.” Woods, 60 F.3d at\n1165.

On summary\njudgment, the traditional burden-shifting framework announced in Mount Healthy and Thaddeus-\nX applies.\n\n        Consequently, the district court erred when it concluded that MDOC’s finding of\nmisconduct “checkmates” Maben’s retaliation claim. Maben’s claim is not barred based merely\non the fact he was found guilty of creating a disturbance at a misconduct hearing.

He\nargues that Maben was not engaged in constitutionally protected activity, and that even if he\nwere, that he violated a legitimate prison regulation and was no longer engaged in protected\nactivity once he became disruptive. Thelen also argues that issuing a minor misconduct ticket\ndoes not rise to the level of “adverse action.” Finally, he argues that Maben has failed to show\nthat the misconduct was motivated by Maben’s protected activity.\n\n       A First Amendment retaliation claim has three elements:\n\n       (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken\n       against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from\n\f No. 17-1289                             Maben v.

However, the right to file\ngrievances is protected only insofar as the grievances are not “frivolous.” Herron, 203 F.3d at\n415. “Abusive or manipulative use of a grievance system would not be protected conduct,”\nKing, 680 F.3d at 699, and an “inmate cannot immunize himself from adverse administrative\naction by prison officials merely by filing a grievance or a lawsuit and then claiming that\neverything that happens to him is retaliatory,” Spies v. Voinovich, 48 F. App’x 520, 525 (6th Cir.\n2002).\n\n         Viewing the facts and drawing all inferences in Maben’s favor, Maben has presented\nsufficient evidence that he was engaged in protected conduct. According to Maben’s account, he\nreceived half the serving of food that he was entitled to receive. He then “politely” and “quietly”\nraised the inadequacy of his food portion to a line worker, a cafeteria worker, and a supervisor.\n(R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 79–80.) It was Thelen who interrupted that process by\nyelling at Maben, “charg[ing]” over to Maben to demand his identification, and issuing him a\nmisconduct ticket.      (Id. at # 79.)     Despite Thelen’s actions, the cafeteria supervisor\n“acknowledged the severely inadequate portion,” took Maben’s tray, and gave him the correct\nserving. (Id.) By complaining about the insufficient quantity of food he had received, Maben\nwas pursuing a grievance about prison conditions and seeking redress of that grievance.\nAccordingly, Maben was engaged in protected conduct.\n\n         Some cases in this Circuit appear to suggest that a prisoner’s grievance is frivolous when\nthe underlying grievance itself is de minimis.

We have also described a non-frivolous grievance as a “legitimate” grievance.\nPasley v. Conerly, 345 F. App’x 981, 985 (6th Cir. 2009). Whether there is in fact a de minimis\nexception to prisoner grievances is irrelevant to the disposition of this case.        Maben was\ncomplaining about the adequacy of his food, and we refuse to say that a complaint about one of\nthe major requirements of life is a frivolous or de minimis grievance. This is especially true\nwhere Maben appears to have been correct: the cafeteria worker “acknowledged the severely\ninadequate portion” and corrected the error. (R. 14, Maben Affidavit, PageID # 79.)\n\n       Further, this is true even though Maben pursued his grievance orally, rather than in\nwriting.

Maben has maintained\nthat he was “attempting to resolve [his] issue with the staff involved prior to writing a grievance”\nand “engaged in the grievance process according to [MDOC] policy.”3 (R. 14, Maben Affidavit,\nPageID # 79–80.) It would be an unfair and illogical result for prisons to require initial oral\ncomplaints, but then be able to argue that a retaliation claim fails because the prisoner filed an\noral, rather than written, complaint. Maben should not be punished for complying with prison\npolicy, nor should prison officials be allowed to retaliate against Maben for making an oral\ngrievance.\n\n        Finally, Thelen argues that if Maben was initially engaged in protected activity, “once\nMaben became disruptive, he violated a legitimate prison regulation and was no longer engaged\nin protected conduct.” (Thelen Br. at 10.)

Adverse Action\n\n        As to the second element, “[a]n adverse action is one that would ‘deter a person of\nordinary firmness’ from the exercise of the right at stake.” Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 396.\n“Whether a retaliatory action is sufficiently severe to deter a person of ordinary firmness from\nexercising his or her rights is a question of fact.” Bell v.

(Maben Br., Disciplinary Sanctions, SA21; R. 13-2, Misconduct Hearing, PageID\n# 67.) The actual punishment resulting from Maben’s misconduct hearing was loss of privileges\nfor seven days.

(R. 14, Maben Affidavit,\nPageID # 79–80.) Maben said that he “[n]ever” became disruptive, but that it was Thelen who\nbegan yelling at Maben, who “became bel[l]iger[e]nt,” and who issued Maben a misconduct\nticket. (Id. at # 79)\n\n         Three separate witnesses corroborate Maben’s account of the events.4 For example,\nRussell Govett stated that Thelen “continued yelling abuses [at Maben] and said something about\n\n\n         4\n          These statements were included in Maben’s pro se response to Thelen’s motion for summary judgment.\nThelen suggests that the “unsworn statements vary in their compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746.” (Thelen Br. at 10\nn.1.) Section 1746 provides that an unsworn declaration may be used as a sworn statement if it is “subscribed” by a\nperson “as true under penalty of perjury, and dated.” 28 U.S.C. § 1746. Luke Carlson’s statement is signed and\ndated “under the penalty of perjury” and attested “to the best of my knowledge.” (R. 14, Statements, PageID # 87.)\nRussell Govett’s statement is signed and dated “under penalty of perjury, that the afore mentioned [sic] is both true\nand correct.” (Id. at # 88.) Anthony Post’s statement is sworn “under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is both\ntrue and correct,” it is signed, but it is not dated. (Id. at # 89.) Under § 1746, then, it seems the only problematic\nstatement is Post’s because it does not contain a date.\n\f No. 17-1289                                   Maben v.

Govett also stated that Thelen “asked Mr. Maben for his ID and wrote him a ticket for\ncomplaining.” (Id.) He said that “[a]t no time during the incident did Mr. Maben get loud or\nspeak in more than a conversational tone.” (Id.)\n\n        Additionally, there is a suspicious temporal proximity between Maben’s grievance and\nthe alleged retaliatory action. This Court has “previously considered the temporal proximity\nbetween protected conduct and retaliatory acts as creating an inference of retaliatory motive.”\nKing, 680 F.3d at 695–96 (citations omitted); Muhammad v. Close, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787320\"><a href=\"/opinion/787320/shakur-muhammad-aka-john-e-mease-v-mark-close/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417–18 (6th\nCir. 2004) (“[T]emporal proximity alone may be significant enough to constitute indirect\nevidence of a causal connection so as to create an inference of retaliatory motive.” (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, Thelen issued the misconduct ticket immediately\nafter Maben raised the issue of inadequate food portions and as Maben was trying to remedy the\nsituation with the food supervisor.5\n\n        Based upon this evidence, we conclude that Maben has introduced sufficient evidence for\na reasonable jury to find that Thelen’s “adverse action was motivated at least in part by\n[Maben’s] protected conduct.” Brown, 312 F.3d at 790. Consequently, the burden shifts to\nThelen. Id.\n\n        Thelen’s only response is that the issuance of a misconduct ticket was not causally\nconnected to any constitutionally protected activity. Instead, he argues that he intervened not\nbecause Maben was engaged in protected activity, but because Maben was causing a disturbance.\nIn his affidavit, Thelen denied retaliating against Maben.                 Again, however, Maben “hotly\ndisputes” that “Maben was causing a disturbance.” (Maben Rep. Br. at 23.) Thelen has “done\nlittle more than deny the allegations put forth by” Maben, which is insufficient to meet his\nburden. Thaddeus-X, 175 F.3d at 399.\n\n\n\n        5\n          Maben also alleges in his pro se complaint that Thelen said “if you’re going to complain then you’re\ngoing to get a misconduct for it.” (R. 1, Complaint, PageID # 5.) Immediately after making that threat to punish\nMaben for pursuing the grievance, Maben alleges that Thelen followed through and issued the misconduct ticket.\nAlthough this did not make it into Maben’s affidavit, if true, it would certainly support Maben’s claim that Thelen\nissued the misconduct ticket because of the complaint, and not because Maben created a disturbance.\n\f No. 17-1289                               Maben v. Thelen                               Page 19\n\n\n        In all, then, Maben has introduced sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on\nhis First Amendment retaliation claim.       We therefore decline to affirm the district court’s\ndecision based on this alternate ground.\n\nIV.     Qualified Immunity\n\n                                      Standard of Review\n\n        This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.            Gillis,\n845 F.3d at 683. Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n        Thelen argues that this Court should affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for Thelen on the grounds that Thelen is entitled to qualified immunity. He argues that\n“there is insufficient evidence that his actions violated clearly established law.” (Thelen Br. at\n15.) We think Maben has introduced sufficient evidence of a violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional right.\n\n        Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, “government officials performing discretionary\nfunctions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.”        Harlow v.

To determine whether\ngovernment officials are entitled to qualified immunity, we ask: “First, taken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show that the officer’s conduct\nviolated a constitutional right? Second, is the right clearly established?” Silberstein v.

Thelen                                   Page 20\n\n\n       As to the first prong, as discussed above, Maben has introduced sufficient evidence that\nThelen violated Maben’s constitutional rights. Thelen tries to argue that he “acted because\nMaben was causing a disturbance, not in retaliation, and not because Maben was engaged in any\nprotected activity.” (Thelen Br. at 17.) But “we assume the truth of all record-supported\nallegations by the non-movant,” Bays v. Montmorency Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268 (6th Cir. 2017)\n(citing Plumhoff v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1861</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1866 (2014).\n\n       As to the second prong, this Court has repeatedly recognized that if a prison officer\n“retaliated against [a prisoner] for filing grievances,” the “alleged conduct also comprises a\nviolation of clearly established constitutional law.” Noble, 87 F.3d at 162 (citations omitted);\nKing v. Zamiara, 150 F. App’x 485, 493 (6th Cir. 2005) (“Charging an inmate with misconduct\nis an adverse action because serious consequences can flow from erroneous charges.”); Scott,\n377 F.3d at 572 (finding it clearly established that “the false issuance of a misconduct charge is\nunconstitutional retaliation”); Bell, 308 F.3d at 612.\n\n       Thelen further argues that there was no violation of a clearly established right because\nour cases dealing with the false issuance of misconduct charges deal with the issuance of major\nmisconduct charges and not minor misconduct charges. We think Thelen’s preoccupation with\nMDOC’s label of major and minor misconduct is misplaced.               Instead of focusing on that\nclassification, Thelen should focus on the action of retaliating by issuing a misconduct ticket and\nthe penalties that come with being found guilty of misconduct. We have made clear that a prison\nofficer may not undertake adverse actions in retaliation for a prisoner’s exercise of his First\nAmendment rights. Bell, 308 F.3d at 612. We have also made clear that actions comparable in\nseriousness to the ones at issue in this case implicate a prisoner’s First Amendment rights. Id.;\nsee supra III.B. (discussing punishments at least as severe as the one imposed in this case).\nMoreover, the sanctions that may be imposed as a result of minor misconduct share features with\nthe sanctions that may be imposed as a result of major misconduct. For example, a prisoner\nfound guilty of minor misconduct may be confined to their cell for five days and lose any\nvisitation rights or access to any prison facilities, including the library. This shares features with\n\f No. 17-1289                              Maben v. Thelen                                   Page 21\n\n\nadministrative segregation, and we have held that being confined in administrative segregation\nfor five days constituted a sufficiently adverse action. Herron, 203 F.3d at 416. Consequently,\nwe think that a reasonable prison officer would have been aware that issuing a misconduct ticket,\neven a minor misconduct ticket, in retaliation for the inmate’s exercise of his First Amendment\nrights could give rise to constitutional liability.

Creighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640\n(1987) (“The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.” (citations omitted)); Bell, 308 F.3d at 612.\n\n       Consequently, we decline Thelen’s invitation to affirm the district court’s decision based\non qualified immunity.\n\nV.     Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.                Gillis,\n845 F.3d at 683. Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n       Thelen argues that as a state officer, the Eleventh Amendment bars Maben’s suit against\nhim in his official capacity.\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment “denies to the federal courts authority to entertain a suit\nbrought by private parties against a state without its consent.” Ford Motor Co. v. Dep’t of\nTreasury of Indiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104057\"><a href=\"/opinion/104057/ford-co-v-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464 (1945) (citation omitted). “The [Supreme] Court has\nheld that, absent waiver by the State or valid congressional override, the Eleventh Amendment\nbars a damages action against a State in federal court.” Kentucky v.

The Eleventh\n\f No. 17-1289                            Maben v. Thelen                                Page 22\n\n\nAmendment, however, does not bar suits for damages against officers in their personal capacity\nunder § 1983. Hafer v. Melo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112657\"><a href=\"/opinion/112657/hafer-v-melo/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25–27 (1991).\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment bars Maben’s “official-capacity action for damages” against\nThelen in federal court. See Kentucky, 473 U.S. at 170. However, the Eleventh Amendment\ndoes not bar Maben’s § 1983 claim against Thelen for damages in his personal capacity. See\nHafer, 502 U.S. at 27.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Thelen on\nMaben’s official-capacity claim based on the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the judgment of\nthe district court and REMAND the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\f</pre>",
