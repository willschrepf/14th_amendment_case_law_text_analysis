Wessmann, challenges the &lt;br&gt;constitutionality of BLS's admissions policy (the Policy).  The &lt;br&gt;district court rebuffed Wessmann's challenge.  See Wessmann v. &lt;br&gt;Boston Sch. Comm., 996 F. Supp. 120 (D. Mass. 1988).  On appeal, we &lt;br&gt;must decide whether the Policy, which makes race a determining &lt;br&gt;factor in the admission of a subset of each year's incoming &lt;br&gt;classes, offends the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.  &lt;br&gt;We conclude that it does. &lt;br&gt;I.  BACKGROUND &lt;br&gt;  We essay a brief historical reconnaissance to set the &lt;br&gt;present dispute in perspective. &lt;br&gt;  Over two decades ago, a federal district court adjudged &lt;br&gt;the City of Boston (through its School Committee) to have violated &lt;br&gt;the constitutional rights of African-American children by promoting &lt;br&gt;and maintaining a dual public school system.  See Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410, 480-81 (D. Mass. 1974) (Morgan I).  &lt;br&gt;Although the court found the school system as a whole guilty of dejure segregation, no specific evidence was produced to suggest that &lt;br&gt;BLS's examination-based admissions policy discriminated against &lt;br&gt;anyone or that those responsible for running BLS intended to &lt;br&gt;segregate the races.  See id. at 467-68.  Nonetheless, BLS &lt;br&gt;exhibited some of the symptoms of segregation:  an anomalously low &lt;br&gt;number of African-American students attended the school, see id. at &lt;br&gt;466 (tabulating statistics for examination schools), and the school &lt;br&gt;had just changed its entrance testing methods pursuant to a consent &lt;br&gt;decree settling charges that the earlier methods were themselves &lt;br&gt;discriminatory, see id. at 467-68.  These factors, combined with &lt;br&gt;the City's inability to demonstrate that existing racial imbalances &lt;br&gt;were not a result of discrimination, led the court to conclude that &lt;br&gt;the City's examination schools (BLS included) were complicit in &lt;br&gt;promoting and maintaining the dual system.  See id.  The &lt;br&gt;presumption established by the Supreme Court in Keyes v. School &lt;br&gt;Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 210 (1973), to the effect that a finding &lt;br&gt;of intentional segregation in a \"meaningful portion\" of a school &lt;br&gt;system suggests that other segregated schooling in the system is &lt;br&gt;not accidental, played a pivotal role both in the district court's &lt;br&gt;holding and in our ensuing affirmance.  See Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 &lt;br&gt;F.2d 580, 594 (1st Cir. 1974) (affirming Morgan I, 379 F. Supp. at &lt;br&gt;467). &lt;br&gt;  The remedy adopted by the district court, among other &lt;br&gt;things, obligated BLS to ensure that at least 35% of each entering &lt;br&gt;class would be composed of African-American and Hispanic students.  &lt;br&gt;See Morgan v. Kerrigan, 401 F. Supp. 216, 258 (D. Mass. 1975).  &lt;br&gt;Relying on the Keyes presumption, we affirmed this set-aside as &lt;br&gt;part of a comprehensive plan to ameliorate pervasive and persistent &lt;br&gt;constitutional infirmities throughout the Boston public schools.  &lt;br&gt;See Morgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401, 425 (1st Cir. 1976). &lt;br&gt;  The Boston school system began  gradually to mend its &lt;br&gt;ways.  By 1987, systemic progress permitted us to conclude that, &lt;br&gt;for all practical purposes, the School Committee had achieved &lt;br&gt;unitariness in the area of student assignments.  See Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Nucci, 831 F.2d 313, 326 (1st Cir. 1987).  We based our conclusion &lt;br&gt;not only on the distribution of students throughout the City's &lt;br&gt;schools, but also on the good faith demonstrated by school &lt;br&gt;administrators in conforming with the demands of meaningful change.  &lt;br&gt;See id. at 319-26.  Because comparable improvement had not been &lt;br&gt;accomplished in other areas, such as faculty and staff integration &lt;br&gt;and the renovation of facilities, we instructed that federal court &lt;br&gt;supervision of elements other than student assignment continue.  &lt;br&gt;See id. at 327-32.  The district court thereupon relinquished &lt;br&gt;control over student assignments, even while retaining active &lt;br&gt;supervision over other aspects of the school system. &lt;br&gt;  After 1987, the City's three examination schools   BLS, &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin Academy, and the O'Bryant School    were no longer &lt;br&gt;under a federal court mandate to maintain a 35% set-aside.  &lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, the School Committee remained committed to the policy &lt;br&gt;until 1995, when a disappointed applicant challenged the set- &lt;br&gt;aside's constitutionality.  The district court granted injunctive &lt;br&gt;relief directing the complainant's admission to BLS.  SeeMcLaughlin v. Boston Sch. Comm., 938 F. Supp. 1001, 1018 (D. Mass. &lt;br&gt;1996).  The School Committee then discontinued the 35% set-aside. &lt;br&gt;  Concerned that the number of African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students admitted to the examination schools might drop &lt;br&gt;precipitously without a predetermined set-aside, school officials &lt;br&gt;began researching alternative admissions policies in hopes of &lt;br&gt;finding one that might prevent that result without offending the &lt;br&gt;Constitution.  The effort started in mid-1996 under the hegemony of &lt;br&gt;Thomas Payzant, superintendent of the Boston public schools.  &lt;br&gt;Payzant commissioned Bain &amp; Co. (Bain), a consulting firm, to &lt;br&gt;review an array of admissions options ranging from lotteries to &lt;br&gt;strict merit-selection plans and to report on how each option might &lt;br&gt;affect the racial and ethnic composition of the examination &lt;br&gt;schools' entering classes. &lt;br&gt;  After Payzant informed the School Committee of Bain's &lt;br&gt;preliminary findings, Robert P. Gittens, the School Committee &lt;br&gt;chairman, appointed a task force to study the matter.  The task &lt;br&gt;force held meetings, hosted public hearings, and ultimately &lt;br&gt;recommended the adoption of Bain's \"Option N50.\"  Bain's study &lt;br&gt;showed that a major difference between Option N50 and some other &lt;br&gt;possible alternatives (such as a strict merit-selection option) was &lt;br&gt;that the former would minimize the diminution of black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;student admissions expected to result from abandonment of the 35% &lt;br&gt;set-aside.  Three members dissented from this recommendation.  The &lt;br&gt;School Committee nonetheless accepted Option N50, effective for the &lt;br&gt;1997-98 school year.  Option N50 thereupon became the core of the &lt;br&gt;Policy. &lt;br&gt;  We recount the Policy's most salient features, leaving &lt;br&gt;aside complexities not relevant to the case at hand.  To gain &lt;br&gt;admission to one of Boston's three examination schools, a student &lt;br&gt;must take a standardized test.  Based on a mathematical formula &lt;br&gt;that purports to predict academic performance, school hierarchs &lt;br&gt;combine each applicant's test score with his or her grade point &lt;br&gt;average, derive a composite score, rank all applicants accordingly, &lt;br&gt;and proceed to assign individuals to the applicant pool for the &lt;br&gt;examination school(s) in which they have indicated an interest.  To  &lt;br&gt;be eligible for admission to any of the examination schools, an &lt;br&gt;applicant must be in the qualified applicant pool (QAP), a group &lt;br&gt;composed of those who rank in the top 50% of the overall applicant &lt;br&gt;pool for that particular school. &lt;br&gt;  Half of the available seats for an examination school's &lt;br&gt;entering class are allocated in strict accordance with composite &lt;br&gt;score rank order.  The other half are allocated on the basis of &lt;br&gt;\"flexible racial/ethnic guidelines\" promulgated as part of the &lt;br&gt;Policy.  To apply these guidelines, school officials first &lt;br&gt;determine the relative proportions of five different racial/ethnic &lt;br&gt;categories   white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American   &lt;br&gt;in the remaining pool of qualified applicants (RQAP), that is, the &lt;br&gt;QAP for the particular school minus those persons already admitted &lt;br&gt;on the basis of composite score rank order alone.  They then fill &lt;br&gt;the open seats in rank order, but the number of students taken from &lt;br&gt;each racial/ethnic category must match the proportion of that &lt;br&gt;category in the RQAP.  Because the racial/ethnic distribution of &lt;br&gt;the second group of successful applicants must mirror that of the &lt;br&gt;RQAP, a member of a designated racial/ethnic group may be passed &lt;br&gt;over in favor of a lower-ranking applicant from another group if &lt;br&gt;the seats allotted for the former's racial/ethnic group have been &lt;br&gt;filled. &lt;br&gt;  Sarah Wessmann encountered such a fate.  BLS had 90 &lt;br&gt;available seats for the 1997 ninth-grade entering class.  Based on &lt;br&gt;her composite score, Sarah ranked 91st (out of 705) in the QAP.  To &lt;br&gt;fill the first 45 seats, the school exhausted the top 47 persons on &lt;br&gt;the list (two aspirants declined in order to accept invitations &lt;br&gt;from another examination school).  Had composite scores alone &lt;br&gt;dictated the selection of the remainder of the ninth-grade entering &lt;br&gt;class, Sarah would have been admitted.  But the racial/ethnic &lt;br&gt;composition of the RQAP was 27.83% black, 40.41% white, 19.21% &lt;br&gt;Asian, 11.64% Hispanic, and 0.31% Native American.  Consequently, &lt;br&gt;the Policy required school officials to allocate the final 45 seats &lt;br&gt;to 13 blacks, 18 whites, 9 Asians, and 5 Hispanics.  As a result, &lt;br&gt;black and Hispanic students whose composite score rankings ranged &lt;br&gt;from 95th to 150th displaced Sarah and ten other white students who &lt;br&gt;had higher composite scores and ranks. &lt;br&gt;  Acting to Sarah's behoof, her father sued a coterie of &lt;br&gt;defendants (collectively, the School Committee), alleging that the  &lt;br&gt;the Policy had defeated her candidacy and challenging its &lt;br&gt;constitutionality.  Following a 13-day bench trial, the district &lt;br&gt;court held that the School Committee's interests in promoting a &lt;br&gt;diverse student body and remedying vestiges of past discrimination &lt;br&gt;were compelling, and that the means crafted by the School Committee &lt;br&gt;to further these interests were not so expansive as to raise &lt;br&gt;constitutional concerns.  See Wessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 127-32.  &lt;br&gt;This appeal ensued. &lt;br&gt;II.  ANALYSIS &lt;br&gt;  We divide our analysis into four segments, beginning with &lt;br&gt;the standards that govern our review, then addressing the general &lt;br&gt;idea of \"compelling governmental interests,\" and, finally, &lt;br&gt;proceeding to consider seriatim the two justifications asserted by &lt;br&gt;the School Committee in defense of the Policy. &lt;br&gt;                     A.  Standards of Review. &lt;br&gt;  The Supreme Court consistently employs sweeping language &lt;br&gt;to identify the species of racial classifications that require &lt;br&gt;strict scrutiny, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U.S. &lt;br&gt;200, 224 (1995) (plurality op.) (concluding upon a review of the &lt;br&gt;Court's precedents that government must \"justify any racial &lt;br&gt;classification subjecting [a] person to unequal treatment under the &lt;br&gt;strictest judicial scrutiny\"); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 267, 273 (1986) (plurality op.) (remarking that racial &lt;br&gt;distinctions of \"any sort\" invite \"the most exacting judicial &lt;br&gt;examination\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), and &lt;br&gt;the Policy fits comfortably within this rubric.  We conclude, &lt;br&gt;therefore, that strict scrutiny is the proper standard for &lt;br&gt;evaluating the Policy.  Hence, the Policy must be both justified by &lt;br&gt;a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to serve &lt;br&gt;that interest in order to stand. &lt;br&gt;  The School Committee's rejoinder   that the Policy is not &lt;br&gt;a quota   is a non sequitur.  We agree that the Policy does not &lt;br&gt;constitute a quota   at least not in the literal sense of an &lt;br&gt;unchanging set-aside   but that fact gains the School Committee &lt;br&gt;little ground.  At a certain point in its application process   &lt;br&gt;specifically, during the selection of the second half of each &lt;br&gt;incoming class   the Policy relies on race and ethnicity, and &lt;br&gt;nothing else, to select a subset of entrants.  Thus, whether the &lt;br&gt;Policy is truly a quota or whether it is best described otherwise &lt;br&gt;is entirely irrelevant for the purpose of equal protection &lt;br&gt;analysis.  Attractive labeling cannot alter the fact that any &lt;br&gt;program which induces schools to grant preferences based on race &lt;br&gt;and ethnicity is constitutionally suspect.  See Regents of Univ. of &lt;br&gt;Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 289 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) &lt;br&gt;(noting that regardless of whether the limitation at issue is &lt;br&gt;described as \"a quota or a goal,\" it is \"a line drawn on the basis &lt;br&gt;of race and ethnic status\"); cf. Lutheran Church-Mo. Synod v. FCC, &lt;br&gt;141 F.3d 344, 354 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (articulating similar sentiments &lt;br&gt;anent employment preferences). &lt;br&gt;  The School Committee also asserts an entitlement to more &lt;br&gt;lenient review because the Policy neither benefits nor burdens any &lt;br&gt;particular group.  Under the flexible guidelines, the argument &lt;br&gt;goes, the racial/ethnic distribution of the entering classes will &lt;br&gt;change yearly, and thus, there is no real preference for any single &lt;br&gt;group. &lt;br&gt;  This assertion leads nowhere, for the manner in which the &lt;br&gt;Policy functions is fundamentally at odds with the equal protection &lt;br&gt;guarantee that citizens will be treated \"as individuals, not as &lt;br&gt;simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national &lt;br&gt;class.\"  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 911 (1995) (citations and &lt;br&gt;internal quotation marks omitted).  Even though we may not know &lt;br&gt;before the fact which individuals from which racial/ethnic groups &lt;br&gt;will be affected, we do know that someone from some group will be &lt;br&gt;benefitted and a different someone from a different group will be &lt;br&gt;burdened.  Because a court's obligation to review race-conscious &lt;br&gt;programs and policies cannot be made to depend \"on the race of &lt;br&gt;those burdened or benefitted by a particular classification,\" City &lt;br&gt;of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 494 (1989) (plurality &lt;br&gt;op.) (citations omitted), no more is exigible to bring strict &lt;br&gt;scrutiny into play. &lt;br&gt;     A remaining issue under this heading concerns our review &lt;br&gt;of the district court's findings and conclusions.  We accord &lt;br&gt;deferential review to specific findings of fact emanating from a &lt;br&gt;bench trial.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  Here, however, because &lt;br&gt;the issues advanced in this appeal   specifically, whether &lt;br&gt;diversity and curing vestiges of past discrimination satisfy strict &lt;br&gt;scrutiny   raise either questions of law or questions about how the &lt;br&gt;law applies to discerned facts, our review is essentially plenary.  &lt;br&gt;See Vecios de Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 978 (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1995). &lt;br&gt;             B.  Compelling Interests:  An Overview. &lt;br&gt;     The question of precisely what interests government may &lt;br&gt;legitimately invoke to justify race-based classifications is &lt;br&gt;largely unsettled.  Of course, we know that such state action is &lt;br&gt;acceptable upon a showing, inter alia, that it is needed to undo &lt;br&gt;the continuing legacy of an institution's past discrimination.  See &lt;br&gt;Miller, 515 U.S. at 920.  We also know that the Court has rejected &lt;br&gt;the \"role model\" theory as a compelling interest.  See Croson, 488 &lt;br&gt;U.S. at 497-98.  Beyond these examples, the case law offers &lt;br&gt;relatively little guidance. &lt;br&gt;     A few cases suggest (albeit in dictum) that remedying &lt;br&gt;past discrimination is the only permissible justification for race- &lt;br&gt;conscious action by the government.  See, e.g., id. at 493 (stating &lt;br&gt;that unless classifications based on race are \"strictly reserved &lt;br&gt;for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial &lt;br&gt;inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility\").  But in &lt;br&gt;certain milieus, some courts have accepted race-based taxonomies &lt;br&gt;that are not linked to remedying past discrimination, particularly &lt;br&gt;in settings such as law enforcement and corrections.  See Wittmerv. Peters, 87 F.3d 916, 919 (7th Cir. 1996) (collecting cases); &lt;br&gt;see also Croson, 488 U.S. at 521 (Scalia, J., concurring) (stating &lt;br&gt;that, \"[a]t least where state or local action is at issue, only a &lt;br&gt;social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and &lt;br&gt;limb\" may justify race-conscious action). &lt;br&gt;     In considering whether other governmental interests, &lt;br&gt;beyond the need to heal the vestiges of past discrimination, may be &lt;br&gt;sufficiently compelling to justify race-based initiatives, courts &lt;br&gt;occasionally mention \"diversity\".  At first blush, it appears that &lt;br&gt;a negative consensus may be emerging on this point.  The Wittmercourt noted that the defendants \"did not rely on generalities about &lt;br&gt;racial balance or diversity\" to justify their hiring program, &lt;br&gt;suggesting that such an attempted justification would have lacked &lt;br&gt;vitality.  87 F.3d at 920.  Other courts have stated the conclusion &lt;br&gt;more explicitly.  See Lutheran Church, 141 F.3d at 354 (ruling out &lt;br&gt;diversity as a compelling governmental interest in the employment &lt;br&gt;context); Hopwood v. State of Texas, 78 F.3d 932, 948 (5th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1996) (similar, in the educational context). &lt;br&gt;     We think that any such consensus is more apparent than &lt;br&gt;real.  In the education context, Hopwood is the only appellate &lt;br&gt;court to have rejected diversity as a compelling interest, and it &lt;br&gt;did so only in the face of vigorous dissent from a substantial &lt;br&gt;minority of the active judges in the Fifth Circuit.  See Hopwood v. &lt;br&gt;State of Texas, 84 F.3d 720, 721 (5th Cir. 1996) (Politz, C.J., &lt;br&gt;with whom King, Wiener, Benavides, Stewart, Parker, and Dennis, &lt;br&gt;JJ., joined, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The &lt;br&gt;question that divided the Fifth Circuit centered on the &lt;br&gt;precedential value of Justice Powell's controlling opinion in &lt;br&gt;Bakke.  The panel in Hopwood pronounced that opinion dead.  The &lt;br&gt;dissenting judges countered that the reports of Bakke's demise were &lt;br&gt;premature. &lt;br&gt;     It may be that the Hopwood panel is correct and that, &lt;br&gt;were the Court to address the question today, it would hold that &lt;br&gt;diversity is not a sufficiently compelling interest to justify a &lt;br&gt;race-based classification.  It has not done so yet, however, and we &lt;br&gt;are not prepared to make such a declaration in the absence of a &lt;br&gt;clear signal that we should.  See Agostini v. Felton, 117 S. Ct. &lt;br&gt;1997, 2017 (1997).  This seems especially prudent because the Court &lt;br&gt;and various individual Justices from time to time have written &lt;br&gt;approvingly of ethnic diversity in comparable settings, see, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 315 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Washington v. &lt;br&gt;Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 472-73 (1982), or have &lt;br&gt;noted that the issue remains open, see Wygant, 476 U.S. at 286 &lt;br&gt;(O'Connor, J., concurring).  But see Metro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 547, 614 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\"Like the vague &lt;br&gt;assertion of societal discrimination, a claim of insufficiently &lt;br&gt;diverse broadcasting viewpoints might be used to justify equally &lt;br&gt;unconstrained racial preferences, linked to nothing other than &lt;br&gt;proportional representation of various races.\"). &lt;br&gt;     As matters turn out, we need not definitively resolve &lt;br&gt;this conundrum today.  Instead, we assume arguendo   but we do not &lt;br&gt;decide   that Bakke remains good law and that some iterations of &lt;br&gt;\"diversity\" might be sufficiently compelling, in specific &lt;br&gt;circumstances, to justify race-conscious actions.  It is against &lt;br&gt;this chiaroscuro backdrop that we address the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;asserted \"diversity\" justification for the Policy.  Thereafter, we &lt;br&gt;turn to its alternate justification:  that the Policy is an &lt;br&gt;appropriate means of remediating the vestiges of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                          C.  Diversity. &lt;br&gt;     The word \"diversity,\" like any other abstract concept, &lt;br&gt;does not admit of permanent, concrete definition.  Its meaning &lt;br&gt;depends not only on time and place, but also upon the person &lt;br&gt;uttering it.  See Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425 (1918) &lt;br&gt;(Holmes, J.) (\"A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, &lt;br&gt;it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color &lt;br&gt;and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it &lt;br&gt;is used.\"); Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States, 880 F.2d 1503, 1504 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1989) (warning of the fallacy of believing that \"a word &lt;br&gt;is a word is a word\").  It would be cause for consternation were a &lt;br&gt;court, without more, free to accept a term as malleable as &lt;br&gt;\"diversity\" in satisfaction of the compelling interest needed to &lt;br&gt;justify governmentally-sponsored racial distinctions. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee demurs.  Citing to Swann v. &lt;br&gt;Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971) (stating &lt;br&gt;that school authorities have \"broad power to formulate and &lt;br&gt;implement educational policy,\" including prescribing a specific &lt;br&gt;percentage of minority students to attend each school \"in order to &lt;br&gt;prepare students to live in a pluralistic society\") (dictum), it &lt;br&gt;labors to persuade us that we would be warranted in deferring to &lt;br&gt;its judgment because school officials necessarily enjoy substantial &lt;br&gt;discretion in making education policy.  We are not convinced. &lt;br&gt;     The Swann song upon which the School Committee relies &lt;br&gt;cannot be wrested from the score. Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 339, 343-44 (1960) (admonishing that, \"[p]articularly in &lt;br&gt;dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, &lt;br&gt;which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and &lt;br&gt;exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and &lt;br&gt;qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must &lt;br&gt;not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling &lt;br&gt;facts\").  Swann was decided when dual educational systems were a &lt;br&gt;reality and efforts to dismantle them were being frustrated by &lt;br&gt;school officials who demonstrated little ardor for implementing the &lt;br&gt;mandates of desegregation.  Chary that the exigencies of the need &lt;br&gt;for change might precipitate a rush to judgment, the Justices &lt;br&gt;confirmed that federal courts must put the horse before the cart, &lt;br&gt;that is, they must diagnose some constitutional malady before &lt;br&gt;beginning to dispense remedies.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 16.  Thus, &lt;br&gt;the Swann dictum, properly construed, recognizes that a low &lt;br&gt;percentage of minority students in a particular school does not &lt;br&gt;necessarily betoken unconstitutional conduct, but may result from &lt;br&gt;innocent causes (say, the population distribution of a given &lt;br&gt;district), and warns that, unless a skewed enrollment pattern is &lt;br&gt;caused by  unconstitutional student assignment practices, federal &lt;br&gt;courts must defer to school officials' discretion and refrain from &lt;br&gt;imposing remedies. &lt;br&gt;     This well-accepted principle does not help the School &lt;br&gt;Committee.  The  Swann Court had no occasion to consider the &lt;br&gt;question, central to this appeal, of whether and to what extent the &lt;br&gt;Constitution circumscribes school officials' discretion to &lt;br&gt;formulate and implement an admissions policy that embraces a &lt;br&gt;particular brand of pluralism.  Cf. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314 (opinion &lt;br&gt;of Powell, J.) (\"Although a university must have wide discretion in &lt;br&gt;making the sensitive judgments as to who should be admitted, &lt;br&gt;constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be &lt;br&gt;disregarded.\").  In the end, then, the School Committee's reference &lt;br&gt;to Swann only begs the question:  Swann reiterated that federal &lt;br&gt;courts must grant remedies where there are constitutional &lt;br&gt;violations, and the question here is whether the School Committee &lt;br&gt;itself has violated the Constitution.  It follows that, in order to &lt;br&gt;persuade us that diversity may serve as a justification for the use &lt;br&gt;of a particular racial classification, the School Committee must do &lt;br&gt;more than ask us blindly to accept its judgment.  It must give &lt;br&gt;substance to the word. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee endeavors to meet this challenge &lt;br&gt;primarily by lauding benefits that it ascribes to diversity.  &lt;br&gt;Drawing on the testimony of various witnesses (school &lt;br&gt;administrators, experts, and alumni), the Committee asserts that, &lt;br&gt;because our society is racially and ethnically heterogeneous, &lt;br&gt;future leaders must learn to converse with and persuade those who &lt;br&gt;do not share their outlook or experience.  This imperative becomes &lt;br&gt;even more urgent because technology, now more than ever, forces &lt;br&gt;heretofore estranged nations and cultures to communicate and &lt;br&gt;cooperate.  For these reasons, the School Committee exhorts us to &lt;br&gt;find that diversity is essential to the modern learning experience. &lt;br&gt;     Stated at this level of abstraction, few would gainsay &lt;br&gt;the attractiveness of diversity.  Encounters between students of &lt;br&gt;varied backgrounds facilitate a vigorous exchange of ideas that not &lt;br&gt;only nourishes the intellect, but also furthers mutual &lt;br&gt;understanding and respect, thereby eroding prejudice and acting as &lt;br&gt;a catalyst for social harmony.  Indeed, Justice Powell's opinion in &lt;br&gt;Bakke acknowledges that these very attributes may render an &lt;br&gt;educational institution's interest in promoting diversity &lt;br&gt;compelling.  See id.     In the last analysis, however, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee's reliance on generalizations undercuts its construct.  &lt;br&gt;If one is to limit consideration to generalities, any proponent of &lt;br&gt;any notion of diversity could recite a similar litany of virtues.  &lt;br&gt;Hence, an inquiring court cannot content itself with abstractions.  &lt;br&gt;Just as Justice Powell probed whether the racial classification at &lt;br&gt;issue in Bakke in fact promoted the institution's stated goals, seeid. at 315-19, we must look beyond the School Committee's recital &lt;br&gt;of the theoretical benefits of diversity and inquire whether the &lt;br&gt;concrete workings of the Policy merit constitutional sanction.  &lt;br&gt;Only by such particularized attention can we ascertain whether the &lt;br&gt;Policy bears any necessary relation to the noble ends it espouses.  &lt;br&gt;In short, the devil is in the details. &lt;br&gt;     By its terms, the Policy focuses exclusively on racial &lt;br&gt;and ethnic diversity.  Its scope is narrowed further in that it &lt;br&gt;takes into account only five groups   blacks, whites, Hispanics, &lt;br&gt;Asians, and Native Americans   without recognizing that none is &lt;br&gt;monolithic.  No more is needed to demonstrate that the School &lt;br&gt;Committee already has run afoul of the guidance provided by the &lt;br&gt;principal authority on which it relies:  \"The diversity that &lt;br&gt;furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader &lt;br&gt;array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or &lt;br&gt;ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\"  Id. at &lt;br&gt;315.  A single-minded focus on ethnic diversity \"hinder[s] rather &lt;br&gt;than further[s] attainment of genuine diversity.\"  Id.  Nor is the &lt;br&gt;Policy saved because the student assignments that it dictates are &lt;br&gt;proportional to the composition of the RQAP.  See id. (noting that &lt;br&gt;the adoption of a \"multitrack\" program \"with a prescribed number of &lt;br&gt;seats set aside each for identifiable category of applicants\" would &lt;br&gt;not heal the admissions plan's constitutional infirmity). &lt;br&gt;     When we articulated this concern at oral argument, the &lt;br&gt;School Committee's able counsel responded that it is unnecessary &lt;br&gt;for the Policy to consider other indicia of diversity because BLS &lt;br&gt;historically has been diverse with respect to everything but race &lt;br&gt;and ethnicity.  For empirical confirmation of this assertion, the &lt;br&gt;School Committee points to Bain's handiwork.  Having analyzed &lt;br&gt;various admissions options, Bain suggested that all the options &lt;br&gt;would result in substantial gender, neighborhood, and socioeconomic &lt;br&gt;diversity, but that, unless race and ethnicity were explicitly &lt;br&gt;factored into the admissions calculus, attainment of racial and &lt;br&gt;ethnic diversity might be jeopardized.  This attempted confirmation &lt;br&gt;does not pass constitutional muster. &lt;br&gt;     If, as we are told, diversity has been attained in all &lt;br&gt;areas other than race and ethnicity, then the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;argument implodes.  Statistics compiled for the last ten years show &lt;br&gt;that under a strict merit-selection approach, black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students together would comprise between 15% and 20% of each &lt;br&gt;entering class, and minorities, in toto, would comprise a &lt;br&gt;substantially greater percentage.  Even on the assumption that the &lt;br&gt;need for racial and ethnic diversity alone might sometimes &lt;br&gt;constitute a compelling interest sufficient to warrant some type of &lt;br&gt;corrective governmental action, it is perfectly clear that the need &lt;br&gt;would have to be acute   much more acute than the relatively modest &lt;br&gt;deviations that attend the instant case.  In short, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee's flexible racial/ethnic guidelines appear to be less a &lt;br&gt;means of attaining diversity in any constitutionally relevant sense &lt;br&gt;and more a means for racial balancing.  The Policy's reliance on a &lt;br&gt;scheme of proportional representation buttresses this appearance &lt;br&gt;and indicates that the School Committee intended mainly to achieve &lt;br&gt;a racial/ethnic \"mix\" that it considered desirable.  Indeed, Bain's &lt;br&gt;Option N50 was chosen and incorporated into the Policy because it &lt;br&gt;held out the promise of increasing minority representation over the &lt;br&gt;roughly 18% that Bain anticipated would result on a strict merit- &lt;br&gt;selection basis. &lt;br&gt;     The testimony at trial amply confirms this suspicion.  &lt;br&gt;Superintendent Payzant testified that a \"fair representation of a &lt;br&gt;cross-section of students\" of the Boston public schools would &lt;br&gt;constitute a proper \"reference point\" for defining a \"diverse mix\" &lt;br&gt;of students.  The \"cross-section\" to which he referred is comprised &lt;br&gt;of the proportions of seventh- and ninth-grade black, Hispanic, &lt;br&gt;white, and Asian students enrolled in Boston's public high schools.  &lt;br&gt;Another \"reference point\" mentioned by Payzant  was the &lt;br&gt;\"proportional representation\" embodied by the Policy, which, given &lt;br&gt;his other testimony, is ultimately designed to move in the &lt;br&gt;direction of the same racial/ethnic distribution.  Other school &lt;br&gt;officials, such as Dr. Elizabeth Reilinger and Dr. Edwin Melendez, &lt;br&gt;testified to like effect, sometimes invoking the notion of &lt;br&gt;\"underrepresentation.\" &lt;br&gt;     We do not question the School Committee's good &lt;br&gt;intentions.  The record depicts a body that is struggling valiantly &lt;br&gt;to come to terms with intractable social and educational issues.  &lt;br&gt;Here, however, the potential for harmful consequences prevents us &lt;br&gt;from succumbing to good intentions.  The Policy is, at bottom, a &lt;br&gt;mechanism for racial balancing   and placing our imprimatur on &lt;br&gt;racial balancing risks setting a precedent that is both dangerous &lt;br&gt;to our democratic ideals and almost always constitutionally &lt;br&gt;forbidden.  See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992); Croson, &lt;br&gt;488 U.S. at 507.  Nor does the School Committee's reliance on &lt;br&gt;alleviating underrepresentation advance its cause.  &lt;br&gt;Underrepresentation is merely racial balancing in disguise   &lt;br&gt;another way of suggesting that there may be optimal proportions for &lt;br&gt;the representation of races and ethnic groups in institutions.  SeeLutheran Church, 141 F.3d at 352. &lt;br&gt;     It cannot be said that racial balancing is either a &lt;br&gt;legitimate or necessary means of advancing the lofty principles &lt;br&gt;recited in the Policy.  The closest the School Committee comes to &lt;br&gt;linking racial balancing to these ideals is by introducing the &lt;br&gt;concept of \"racial isolation.\"  The idea is that unless there is a &lt;br&gt;certain representation of any given racial or ethnic group in a &lt;br&gt;particular institution, members of that racial or ethnic group will &lt;br&gt;find it difficult, if not impossible, to express themselves.  Thus, &lt;br&gt;the School Committee says, some minimum number of black and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students   precisely how many, we do not know   is &lt;br&gt;required to prevent racial isolation. &lt;br&gt;     Fundamental problems beset this approach.  In the first &lt;br&gt;place, the \"racial isolation\" justification is extremely suspect &lt;br&gt;because it assumes that students cannot function or express &lt;br&gt;themselves unless they are surrounded by a sufficient number of &lt;br&gt;persons of like race or ethnicity.  Insofar as the Policy promotes &lt;br&gt;groups over individuals, it is starkly at variance with Justice &lt;br&gt;Powell's understanding of the proper manner in which a diverse &lt;br&gt;student body may be gathered.  See Bakke, 458 U.S. at 318.  &lt;br&gt;Furthermore, if justified in terms of group identity, the Policy &lt;br&gt;suggests that race or ethnic background determines how individuals &lt;br&gt;think or behave   although the School Committee resists this &lt;br&gt;conclusion by arguing that the greater the number of a particular &lt;br&gt;group, the more others will realize that the group is not &lt;br&gt;monolithic.  Either way, the School Committee tells us that a &lt;br&gt;minimum number of persons of a given race (or ethnic background) is &lt;br&gt;essential to facilitate individual expression.  This very position &lt;br&gt;concedes that the Policy's racial/ethnic guidelines treat &lt;br&gt;\"individuals as the product of their race,\" a practice that the &lt;br&gt;Court consistently has denounced as impermissible stereotyping.  &lt;br&gt;Miller, 515 U.S. at 912. &lt;br&gt;     In the second place, the School Committee has failed to &lt;br&gt;give us a plausible reason why we should believe that racial &lt;br&gt;balancing of any type is necessary to promote the expression of &lt;br&gt;ideas or any of the other ideals referenced in the Policy.  We &lt;br&gt;assume for argument's sake   albeit with considerable skepticism   &lt;br&gt;that there may be circumstances under which a form of racial &lt;br&gt;balancing could be justified by concerns for attaining the goals &lt;br&gt;articulated by the Policy.  To justify something so antithetical to &lt;br&gt;our constitutional jurisprudence, however, a particularly strong &lt;br&gt;showing of necessity would be required.  The School Committee has &lt;br&gt;provided absolutely no competent evidence that the proportional &lt;br&gt;representation promoted by the Policy is in any way tied to the &lt;br&gt;vigorous exchange of ideas, let alone that, in such respects, it &lt;br&gt;differs significantly in consequence from, say, a strict merit- &lt;br&gt;selection process.  Nor has the School Committee concretely &lt;br&gt;demonstrated that the differences in the percentages of students &lt;br&gt;resulting from the Policy and other, constitutionally acceptable &lt;br&gt;alternatives are significant in any other way, such as students' &lt;br&gt;capacity and willingness to learn.  To the contrary, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee relies only on broad generalizations by a few witnesses, &lt;br&gt;which, in the absence of solid and compelling evidence, constitute &lt;br&gt;no more than rank speculation.  Given both the Constitution's &lt;br&gt;general prohibition against racial balancing and the potential &lt;br&gt;dangers of stereotyping, we cannot allow generalities emanating &lt;br&gt;from the subjective judgments of local officials to dictate whether &lt;br&gt;a particular percentage of a particular racial or ethnic group is &lt;br&gt;sufficient or insufficient for individual students to avoid &lt;br&gt;isolation and express ideas. &lt;br&gt;     This brings us full circle.  Although Justice Powell &lt;br&gt;endorsed diversity as potentially comprising a compelling interest, &lt;br&gt;he warned that a proper admissions policy would be such that if an &lt;br&gt;applicant \"loses out\" to another candidate, he will \"not have been &lt;br&gt;foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply because he &lt;br&gt;was not the right color or had the wrong surname.\"  Bakke, 458 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 318.  The Policy does precisely what Justice Powell deemed &lt;br&gt;anathematic:  at a certain point, it effectively forecloses some &lt;br&gt;candidates from all consideration for a seat at an examination &lt;br&gt;school simply because of the racial or ethnic category in which &lt;br&gt;they fall.  That happened to Sarah Wessmann.  It violated the Equal &lt;br&gt;Protection Clause.  See People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., &lt;br&gt;111 F.3d 528, 538 (7th Cir. 1997) (concluding that preventing &lt;br&gt;\"children who are not beneficiaries of past discrimination\" from &lt;br&gt;becoming cheerleaders solely because of their race is \"a barefaced &lt;br&gt;denial of equal protection\"). &lt;br&gt;     Again, let us be perfectly clear.  We are aware that two &lt;br&gt;of our sister courts of appeals have suggested that diversity may &lt;br&gt;never constitute a compelling governmental interest sufficient to &lt;br&gt;warrant race-based classifications.  See Lutheran Church, 141 F.3d &lt;br&gt;at 354; Hopwood, 78 F.3d at 948.  For purposes of resolving this &lt;br&gt;appeal, however, we need not speak definitively to that vexing &lt;br&gt;question.  Experience is \"the life of the law,\" Justice Holmes &lt;br&gt;commented, and more probably ought to be said before this chapter &lt;br&gt;of constitutional inquiry is closed.  We conclude today only that &lt;br&gt;the School Committee's Policy does not meet the Bakke standard and, &lt;br&gt;accordingly, that the concept of \"diversity\" implemented by BLS  &lt;br&gt;does not justify a race-based classification. &lt;br&gt;               D.  Vestiges of Past Discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee endeavors, in the alternative, to &lt;br&gt;uphold the Policy as a means of redressing the vestiges of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  The court below accepted this explanation.  SeeWessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 131.  We do not. &lt;br&gt;     Governmental bodies have a significant interest in &lt;br&gt;adopting programs and policies designed to eradicate the effects of &lt;br&gt;past discrimination.  See Miller, 515 U.S. at 920; Mackin v. City &lt;br&gt;of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1275 (1st Cir. 1992).  Before embarking &lt;br&gt;on such projects, however, government actors must be able to muster &lt;br&gt;a \"strong basis in evidence\" showing that a current social ill in &lt;br&gt;fact has been caused by such conduct.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 500.  &lt;br&gt;In giving meaning to the phrase \"strong basis in evidence,\" we are &lt;br&gt;guided primarily by the Court's particularized analysis in Crosonand by the \"body of appellate jurisprudence [that] has developed to &lt;br&gt;provide that label with meaningful content.\"  Engineering &lt;br&gt;Contractors Ass'n of S. Fla., Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 122 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 895, 909 (11th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1186 &lt;br&gt;(1998). &lt;br&gt;     The threshold problem that we confront in this instance &lt;br&gt;is that the School Committee disclaims the necessity for such &lt;br&gt;evidence.  Its disclaimer rests on the premise that a decree issued &lt;br&gt;in the quarter-century-old desegregation litigation mandates local &lt;br&gt;authorities to remedy any racial imbalance occurring in the school &lt;br&gt;system and thereby obviates the need for an independent showing of &lt;br&gt;causation.  This premise lacks force. &lt;br&gt;     The decree in question was entered in 1994 by Judge &lt;br&gt;Garrity, pursuant to our instructions in Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d &lt;br&gt;313 (1st Cir. 1987).  The particular provision to which the School &lt;br&gt;Committee refers is entitled \"Permanent Injunction.\"  It enjoins &lt;br&gt;the School Committee \"from discriminating on the basis of race in &lt;br&gt;the operation of the public schools of the City of Boston and from &lt;br&gt;creating, promoting or maintaining racial segregation in any school &lt;br&gt;or other facility in the Boston public school system.\"  Nothing in &lt;br&gt;the plain language of this provision requires school officials to &lt;br&gt;undertake any affirmative action, let alone to adopt a race-based &lt;br&gt;classification (such as is contained in the Policy).  Perhaps more &lt;br&gt;important, the cited provision is not (as the School Committee &lt;br&gt;would have it) a mandatory injunction.  Rather, it operates as a &lt;br&gt;negative injunction, forbidding the defendants from engaging in the &lt;br&gt;acts that supported the original cause of action.  As long as &lt;br&gt;school officials do not engage in discrimination against minorities &lt;br&gt;  and there is no evidence that such conduct persists at BLS   they &lt;br&gt;have not violated the injunction. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee's contention that racial imbalance, &lt;br&gt;without more, mandates action also is discordant with established &lt;br&gt;precepts of constitutional law.  Once there is a finding of &lt;br&gt;unitariness and the \"affirmative duty to desegregate has been &lt;br&gt;accomplished,\" school authorities are not expected to make \"year- &lt;br&gt;by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies\" &lt;br&gt;absent a \"showing that either the school authorities or some other &lt;br&gt;agency of the State has deliberately attempted to fix or alter &lt;br&gt;demographic patterns to affect the racial composition of the &lt;br&gt;schools.\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 32; see also Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494 &lt;br&gt;(\"Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has been &lt;br&gt;remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance &lt;br&gt;that is caused by demographic factors.\"). &lt;br&gt;     That ends this aspect of the matter.  We concluded over &lt;br&gt;ten years ago that Boston had restored the unitariness of student &lt;br&gt;assignments, see Nucci, 831 F.2d at 319-26, and there is no &lt;br&gt;contention here that any municipal actor has attempted &lt;br&gt;intentionally to subvert the demographic composition of BLS (or any &lt;br&gt;other school, for that matter).  Under such circumstances, neither &lt;br&gt;the Constitution nor the 1994 decree impose a duty on Boston's &lt;br&gt;school officials to ensure the maintenance of certain percentages &lt;br&gt;of any racial or ethnic group in any particular school. &lt;br&gt;     Because the 1994 decree turns out to be a blind alley, &lt;br&gt;the School Committee must identify a vestige of bygone &lt;br&gt;discrimination and provide convincing evidence that ties this &lt;br&gt;vestige to the de jure segregation of the benighted past.  SeeFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494.    To meet this challenge, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee cites an \"achievement gap\" between black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students, on the one hand, and white and Asian students, on the &lt;br&gt;other, and claims that this gap's roots can be traced to the &lt;br&gt;discriminatory regime of the 1970s and before. &lt;br&gt;     The scope of what social phenomena the law considers &lt;br&gt;vestiges of past discrimination presents an open question.  The &lt;br&gt;presumptive vestiges are the well-known factors that the Supreme &lt;br&gt;Court enumerated in Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 435 &lt;br&gt;(1968) (mentioning student assignments, faculty, staff, facilities, &lt;br&gt;transportation, and extra-curricular activities).  Since Green, &lt;br&gt;federal courts have recognized other permutations, including &lt;br&gt;\"quality of education.\"  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492.  What this means &lt;br&gt;and how it is to be measured are difficult questions.  Rather than &lt;br&gt;entering that debate, we accept arguendo the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;position that, in principle, a documented achievement gap may act &lt;br&gt;as an indicator of a diminution in the quality of education.  Even &lt;br&gt;so, whether an achievement gap is a vestige of past discrimination &lt;br&gt;depends on whether there is satisfactory evidence of a causal &lt;br&gt;connection. &lt;br&gt;     The court below short-circuited this inquiry.  Citing &lt;br&gt;Judge Garrity's 1994 order, the court reasoned that, once there has &lt;br&gt;been a past judicial finding of institutional discrimination, no &lt;br&gt;more evidence is needed to justify a policy that employs racial &lt;br&gt;classifications.  See Wessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 131 (stating that &lt;br&gt;the 1994 order is a \"manifestation\" of the reality of vestiges of &lt;br&gt;past discrimination and that it alone provides a \"compelling basis\" &lt;br&gt;for adoption of the Policy).  The lower court was wrong. &lt;br&gt;     There are times when a history of discrimination, in &lt;br&gt;itself, may supply a powerful evidentiary predicate sufficient to &lt;br&gt;justify some race-conscious action.  See, e.g., Boston Police &lt;br&gt;Superior Officers Fed'n v. City of Boston, 147 F.3d 13 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1998).  Nevertheless, such holdings do not hinge on the mere &lt;br&gt;existence of a past judicial finding, but, rather, on a variety of &lt;br&gt;considerations, including what transpired since the time of that &lt;br&gt;finding.  In Boston Police, for example, our detailed inquiry &lt;br&gt;revealed not only that discrimination had been a fact of the past, &lt;br&gt;but that it persisted in the Boston Police Department, and that &lt;br&gt;relatively little had been done to alleviate the situation at &lt;br&gt;certain levels.  See id. at 19-23.  The record showed, for &lt;br&gt;instance, that notwithstanding the existence of a consent decree, &lt;br&gt;progress toward the integration of the police force had been &lt;br&gt;\"halting\" and \"modest.\"  Id. at 23.  The statistical evidence &lt;br&gt;supporting this view pertained not to a distant past, but to &lt;br&gt;present realities.  See id. at 21, 23.  In the final analysis, it &lt;br&gt;was the combination of all this evidence, and the detailed showing &lt;br&gt;that the effects of earlier discriminatory conduct continued to the &lt;br&gt;present, that underpinned our conclusions.  Withal, we took pains &lt;br&gt;to warn against indiscriminate reliance on history alone lest it &lt;br&gt;permit the adoption of remedial measures \"ageless in their reach &lt;br&gt;into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\"  &lt;br&gt;Id. at 20-21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). &lt;br&gt;     In sum, whether past discrimination necessitates current &lt;br&gt;action is a fact-sensitive inquiry, and courts must pay careful &lt;br&gt;attention to competing explanations for current realities.  SeeFreeman, 503 U.S. at 495-96 (explaining that \"though we cannot &lt;br&gt;escape our history, neither must we overstate its consequences in &lt;br&gt;fixing legal responsibilities\").  The mere fact that an institution &lt;br&gt;once was found to have practiced discrimination is insufficient, in &lt;br&gt;and of itself, to satisfy a state actor's burden of producing the &lt;br&gt;reliable evidence required to uphold race-based action.  See id.at 496; Middleton v. City of Flint, 92 F.3d 396, 409 (6th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1996). &lt;br&gt;     Beyond history, the School Committee offers statistical &lt;br&gt;and anecdotal evidence to satisfy its burden of demonstrating a &lt;br&gt;strong evidentiary basis for the inauguration of remedial policies.  &lt;br&gt;The district court found the evidence favoring race-conscious &lt;br&gt;remedies to be adequate, but  the court's entire treatment of the &lt;br&gt;subject comprises a lone paragraph composed of unrelievedly &lt;br&gt;conclusory observations.  See Wessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 131.  In &lt;br&gt;the absence of specific findings, we could remand.  Given the time &lt;br&gt;constraints applicable to the case, we opt instead to exercise &lt;br&gt;plenary review, taking the statistical and anecdotal evidence in &lt;br&gt;the manner suggested by the School Committee.  See Vecios de &lt;br&gt;Barrio Uno, 72 F.3d at 989 (observing that appellate courts &lt;br&gt;ordinarily \"should fill in blanks in the district court's account &lt;br&gt;when the record and the circumstances permit this to be done &lt;br&gt;without short-changing the parties\"). &lt;br&gt;     The centerpiece of the School Committee's showing &lt;br&gt;consists of statistical evidence addressed to a persistent &lt;br&gt;achievement gap at the primary school level between white and Asian &lt;br&gt;students, on the one hand, and black and Hispanic students, on the &lt;br&gt;other.  One way to measure the achievement gap is in terms of &lt;br&gt;relative performance on standardized tests.  Over the years, whites &lt;br&gt;and Asians have scored significantly higher, on average, than &lt;br&gt;blacks and Hispanics.  The School Committee theorizes that, because &lt;br&gt;of this achievement gap, BLS receives fewer African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic applicants than otherwise might be the case, and even in &lt;br&gt;comparison to this modest universe, an abnormally small number of &lt;br&gt;black and Hispanic students qualify for admission.  Accordingly, &lt;br&gt;the Committee concludes that the statistics documenting the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap, on their own, satisfy the \"strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence\" requirement. &lt;br&gt;     In mounting this argument, the School Committee relies &lt;br&gt;heavily on a line of cases addressing affirmative action plans &lt;br&gt;designed to remedy vestiges of past employment discrimination.  &lt;br&gt;See, e.g., Peightal v. Metropolitan Dade County, 26 F.3d 1545 (11th &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1994); Stuart v. Roache, 951 F.2d 446 (1st Cir. 1991).  This &lt;br&gt;reliance is mislaid.  Fundamental differences distinguish the &lt;br&gt;statistical inquiry involved in the employment discrimination &lt;br&gt;context from the one proposed by the School Committee here.  In &lt;br&gt;employment discrimination cases, we know ex ante the locus of &lt;br&gt;discrimination:  it is the barrier to entry.  Based on that &lt;br&gt;premise, an appropriate statistical analysis compares the number of &lt;br&gt;qualified minority applicants with those who gain entrance.  The &lt;br&gt;greater the disparity, the stronger the inference that &lt;br&gt;discrimination is the cause of non-entry.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;501-02; Stuart, 951 F.2d at 451. &lt;br&gt;     In this case, the \"barrier to entry\" comparable to those &lt;br&gt;in the employment discrimination cases is BLS's requirement of an &lt;br&gt;entrance examination and the resultant composite score   and no one &lt;br&gt;(least of all, the School Committee) claims that the examination or &lt;br&gt;any component thereof is discriminatory in operation or effect, or &lt;br&gt;that it would be discriminatory if it were used as the sole &lt;br&gt;criterion for admission.  Such a claim was central to our &lt;br&gt;conclusion in Stuart, 951 F.2d at 451, and it is totally absent &lt;br&gt;here.  What is more, any such claim would make precious little &lt;br&gt;sense in the context of the School Committee's argument, for &lt;br&gt;standardized achievement tests (a component of the entrance &lt;br&gt;examination) are the primary objective measurement of the asserted &lt;br&gt;achievement gap. &lt;br&gt;     With the admissions process eliminated as an illegitimate &lt;br&gt;barrier to entry, the achievement gap statistics, by themselves, &lt;br&gt;must specifically point to other allegedly discriminatory conduct &lt;br&gt;in order to suggest a causal link between those discriminatory acts &lt;br&gt;and the achievement gap.  Unlike the focused inquiry characteristic &lt;br&gt;of the employment discrimination cases, however, the raw &lt;br&gt;achievement gap statistics presented in this case do not by &lt;br&gt;themselves isolate any particular locus of discrimination for &lt;br&gt;measurement.  Without such a focus, the achievement gap statistics &lt;br&gt;cannot possibly be said to measure the causal effect of any &lt;br&gt;particular phenomenon, whether it be discrimination or anything &lt;br&gt;else.  Cf. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 294-95 (1987) &lt;br&gt;(contrasting legitimacy of inferences drawn from focused use of &lt;br&gt;statistical methods in employment discrimination and venire- &lt;br&gt;selection cases, on the one hand, with those drawn from application &lt;br&gt;of general statistics to explain source of decisions in specific &lt;br&gt;trials and sentencing proceedings).  As such, the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;statistics, by themselves, do not even eliminate the possibility &lt;br&gt;that they are caused by what the Court terms \"societal &lt;br&gt;discrimination.\"  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 909-10 (1996); seealso Coalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d &lt;br&gt;752, 776-78 (3d Cir. 1996) (affirming findings that poor &lt;br&gt;performance and achievement gap were caused by socioeconomic &lt;br&gt;factors unrelated to past discrimination).  To be sure, gross &lt;br&gt;statistical disparities at times may suffice to satisfy a state &lt;br&gt;actor's burden of production.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 501.  But &lt;br&gt;the achievement gap statistics adduced here fail to do so because &lt;br&gt;it is unclear exactly what causative factors they measure. &lt;br&gt;     The Croson Court relied on precisely this reasoning when &lt;br&gt;it concluded, in the contractor context, that low minority &lt;br&gt;membership in a local trade association \"standing alone, cannot &lt;br&gt;establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\"  Id. at 503.  The &lt;br&gt;Court reasoned that there could be \"numerous explanations for this &lt;br&gt;dearth of minority participation, including past societal &lt;br&gt;discrimination.\"  Id.  Therefore, if such statistics are to be at &lt;br&gt;all probative of discrimination, they must link cause and effect &lt;br&gt;variables in a manner which would permit such an inference.  Seeid. (\"For low minority membership in these associations to be &lt;br&gt;relevant, the city would have to link it to the number of local &lt;br&gt;MBEs eligible for membership.  If the statistical disparity between &lt;br&gt;eligible MBEs and MBE membership were great enough, an inference of &lt;br&gt;discriminatory exclusion could arise.\"). &lt;br&gt;     We do not propose that the achievement gap bears no &lt;br&gt;relation to some form of prior discrimination.  We posit only that &lt;br&gt;it is fallacious to maintain that an endless gaze at any set of raw &lt;br&gt;numbers permits a court to arrive at a valid etiology of complex &lt;br&gt;social phenomena.  Even strong statistical correlation between &lt;br&gt;variables does not automatically establish causation.  See Tagatzv. Marquette Univ., 861 F.2d 1040, 1044 (7th Cir. 1988); Ste. Marie &lt;br&gt;v. Eastern R.R. Ass'n, 650 F.2d 395, 400 (2d Cir. 1981) (Friendly, &lt;br&gt;J.).  On their own, the achievement gap statistics here do not even &lt;br&gt;identify a variable with which we can begin to hypothesize the &lt;br&gt;existence of a correlation. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee attempts to compensate for this &lt;br&gt;shortcoming by pointing to certain alleged phenomena that it claims &lt;br&gt;constitute substantial causes of the achievement gap.  Chief among &lt;br&gt;these is \"low teacher expectations\" vis--vis African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students, a condition which the School Committee argues is &lt;br&gt;an attitudinal remnant of the segregation era.  To show the &lt;br&gt;systemic nature of this alleged phenomenon, the School Committee &lt;br&gt;leans heavily on the testimony of Dr. William Trent.  Dr. Trent, a &lt;br&gt;sociologist, identified teachers' low expectations of African- &lt;br&gt;American and Hispanic students as a significant factor underlying &lt;br&gt;the achievement gap in the Boston public schools.  He based his &lt;br&gt;conclusion on an analogy that he drew from studies he had performed &lt;br&gt;in the Kansas City school system, including a \"climate survey\" of &lt;br&gt;teacher attitudes and a multiple regression analysis designed to &lt;br&gt;determine whether the low expectations reflected in teachers' &lt;br&gt;answers to the questions posed in the climate survey might &lt;br&gt;partially explain the achievement gap.  Based on these materials, &lt;br&gt;Dr. Trent had concluded that, in Kansas City,  teacher \"efficacy\" &lt;br&gt;  a term of art referring to a teacher's success in encouraging &lt;br&gt;pupils to succeed   correlated with higher achievement test scores. &lt;br&gt;     One difficulty with Dr. Trent's testimony is that it &lt;br&gt;relies on evidence from one locality to establish the lingering &lt;br&gt;effects of discrimination in another.  Dr. Trent noted, for &lt;br&gt;example, that data he examined from the Boston public schools &lt;br&gt;revealed patterns \"consistent with\" his findings concerning the &lt;br&gt;Kansas City schools.  Croson, however, reaffirmed the Court's &lt;br&gt;longstanding teaching that we must staunchly resist attempts to &lt;br&gt;substitute speculation about correlation for evidence of causation.  &lt;br&gt;See Croson, 488 U.S. at 504 (\"We have never approved the &lt;br&gt;extrapolation of discrimination in one jurisdiction from the &lt;br&gt;experience of another.\") (citing Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, &lt;br&gt;746 (1974)).  In this context, the Court emphasized that although &lt;br&gt;government may adopt race-conscious remedies when there is evidence &lt;br&gt;of lingering vestiges, it \"must identify that discrimination, &lt;br&gt;public or private, with some specificity\" before it adopts the &lt;br&gt;remedy.  See id. at 504.  At the very least, this would require &lt;br&gt;solid evidence that Boston teachers have low expectations of &lt;br&gt;minority students, and that these low expectations are related in &lt;br&gt;a statistically significant way to the achievement gap. &lt;br&gt;     Dr. Trent, however, never conducted a \"climate survey\" &lt;br&gt;for the Boston school system.  His conclusions for Boston were &lt;br&gt;based only on a review of statistical data documenting the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap  (basically, the statistics regarding achievement &lt;br&gt;test results and differing application and enrollment rates), &lt;br&gt;statistics concerning teacher seniority, and anecdotal evidence &lt;br&gt;about teacher attitudes supplied by school officials.  When asked &lt;br&gt;on cross-examination whether the data that he relied on for his &lt;br&gt;conclusions anent teacher attitudes were scientifically gathered, &lt;br&gt;Dr. Trent responded in the negative.  Dr. Trent thus freely &lt;br&gt;conceded that the data he used was not of the quality necessary to &lt;br&gt;satisfy the methodological rigors required by his discipline.  &lt;br&gt;Because Dr. Trent failed to follow his own prescribed scientific &lt;br&gt;methodology for collecting data on the one issue central to his &lt;br&gt;hypothesis about achievement gap causation, the trial court could &lt;br&gt;not credit his conclusions. &lt;br&gt;     An \"opinion has a significance proportioned to the &lt;br&gt;sources that sustain it.\"  Petrogradsky Mejdunarodny Kommerchesky &lt;br&gt;Bank v. National City Bank, 253 N.Y. 23, 25, 170 N.E. 479, 483 &lt;br&gt;(1930) (Cardozo, J.).  When scientists (including social &lt;br&gt;scientists) testify in court, they must bring the same intellectual &lt;br&gt;rigor to the task that is required of them in other professional &lt;br&gt;settings.  See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 579 (1993); Braun v. Lorillard, Inc., 84 F.3d 230, 234 (7th &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1996); see also People Who Care, 111 F.3d at 537 (declaring, &lt;br&gt;in reviewing admissibility of social science evidence purporting to &lt;br&gt;quantify causes of achievement gap, that \"the methods used by the &lt;br&gt;expert to derive his opinion [must] satisfy the standards for &lt;br&gt;scientific methodology that his profession would require of his &lt;br&gt;out-of-court research\").  The only excuse that Dr. Trent proffered &lt;br&gt;for his failure to follow proper protocols was that a thorough &lt;br&gt;study would have required more time than he had available.  That is &lt;br&gt;unacceptable.  See Braun, 84 F.3d at 234.  An expert witness can &lt;br&gt;only deviate from accepted methods of scientific inquiry in ways &lt;br&gt;that are consistent with the practices and usages of the scientific &lt;br&gt;community. &lt;br&gt;     The shortcomings in Dr. Trent's testimony largely relate &lt;br&gt;to his failure to gather data systematically and point up the &lt;br&gt;pitfalls that the School Committee invited by failing to validate &lt;br&gt;the Policy in advance.  Dr. Trent's charge was to trace the causal &lt;br&gt;relationship, if any, between teacher attitudes and poor student &lt;br&gt;performance.  His failure to obtain reliable data disabled him from &lt;br&gt;taking even the first step, for he could not validly establish &lt;br&gt;whether Boston teachers' attitudes in fact were discriminatory, let &lt;br&gt;alone show that they caused (or even significantly contributed to) &lt;br&gt;the achievement gap.  This first step is a cornerstone of the &lt;br&gt;entire research project; in its absence, Dr. Trent could not &lt;br&gt;legitimately eliminate other variables (including societal &lt;br&gt;discrimination) that might explain the achievement gap in the &lt;br&gt;Boston public schools.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 503; People Who &lt;br&gt;Care, 111 F.3d at 537.  It follows inexorably that, with no &lt;br&gt;methodological support, he could not produce a meaningful analysis &lt;br&gt;of causation and, accordingly, his conclusions cannot bear the &lt;br&gt;weight of the School Committee's thesis.  See Mid-State Fertilizer &lt;br&gt;Co. v. Exchange Nat'l Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989) &lt;br&gt;(\"An expert who supplies nothing but a bottom line supplies nothing &lt;br&gt;of value to the judicial process.\"). &lt;br&gt;     Dr. Trent's reliance on anecdotal evidence fares no &lt;br&gt;better.  As a general matter, anecdotal evidence is problematic &lt;br&gt;because it does not tend to show that a problem is pervasive.  SeeCoral Constr. Co. v. King County, 941 F.2d 910, 919 (9th Cir. 1991) &lt;br&gt;(\"While anecdotal evidence may suffice to prove individual claims &lt;br&gt;of discrimination, rarely, if ever, can such evidence show a &lt;br&gt;systematic pattern of discrimination necessary for the adoption of &lt;br&gt;an affirmative action plan.\").  Thus, even though anecdotal &lt;br&gt;evidence may prove powerful when proffered in conjunction with &lt;br&gt;admissions or valid statistical evidence, anecdotal evidence alone &lt;br&gt;can establish institutional discrimination only in the most &lt;br&gt;exceptional circumstances.  See Engineering Contractors Ass'n, 122 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 925-26 (collecting cases). &lt;br&gt;     This case falls well within the general rule rather than &lt;br&gt;the long-odds exception to it.  The most specific testimony &lt;br&gt;regarding low teacher expectations came from Deputy Superintendent &lt;br&gt;Janice Jackson, whom the district court qualified as an expert &lt;br&gt;witness.  At one point in her career, Deputy Superintendent Jackson &lt;br&gt;had received some training related to improving interactions &lt;br&gt;between teachers and students (a program known as TEASA, an acronym &lt;br&gt;for \"teacher expectation and student achievement\") by dispelling &lt;br&gt;teachers' \"unconscious biases.\"  Without disparaging Ms. Jackson's &lt;br&gt;credentials, we reject the contention that her observations, as &lt;br&gt;presented at trial, provide any justification for a conclusion that &lt;br&gt;a statistically meaningful number of Boston school teachers have &lt;br&gt;low expectations of minority students. &lt;br&gt;     Deputy Superintendent Jackson testified to two sets of &lt;br&gt;observations.  The first occurred before she joined the school &lt;br&gt;system.  She spent three months in classrooms as a \"blind &lt;br&gt;researcher,\" making certain observations for an unspecified &lt;br&gt;research project.  In the process, she apparently visited six or &lt;br&gt;seven schools (although she could recall only two by name).  She &lt;br&gt;testified that, during this time, she observed teachers treat &lt;br&gt;minority and non-minority students differently.  The differential &lt;br&gt;treatment included calling on one set of pupils but not on another, &lt;br&gt;disparate reprimands for the same behavior, and failure to push for &lt;br&gt;\"higher order thinking.\"  Her second set of observations occurred &lt;br&gt;once she became deputy superintendent.  Here, her testimony is &lt;br&gt;unrelievedly general.  Although she visited numerous schools during &lt;br&gt;this interval, her testimony is silent as to the purpose of these &lt;br&gt;visits.  It is equally silent as to crucial details, e.g., how many &lt;br&gt;classrooms she visited or how many teachers she observed. &lt;br&gt;     The short of it is that, to the extent that Ms. Jackson &lt;br&gt;purposed to testify as an expert, she was obligated to present her &lt;br&gt;data and her methodology with some specificity.  In lieu of &lt;br&gt;specifics, Ms. Jackson offered only her unsubstantiated &lt;br&gt;recollection of past events.  Croson reminds us that, in &lt;br&gt;considering the legitimacy of race classifications, we must not &lt;br&gt;blindly defer to the other branches' assurances that a particular &lt;br&gt;condition exists.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 501-02; see also Hayesv. North State Law Enf. Officers' Ass'n, 10 F.3d 207, 214 (4th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1993) (applying Croson and concluding that police chief's testimony &lt;br&gt;did not constitute strong basis in evidence to justify race- &lt;br&gt;conscious remedy even though the testimony was \"based on his &lt;br&gt;significant experience in the field of law enforcement\").  Because &lt;br&gt;Ms. Jackson was unable to quantify her observations in any manner &lt;br&gt;whatsoever, the district court could not validly conclude that the &lt;br&gt;number of \"problem\" teachers she observed was statistically &lt;br&gt;significant.  Indeed, Dr. Trent was unable to utilize these &lt;br&gt;observations to conduct any statistical analysis to provide a &lt;br&gt;meaningful account of achievement gap causation.  This inability &lt;br&gt;illustrates one reason why anecdotal evidence, which includes &lt;br&gt;testimony based on significant personal experience, rarely suffices &lt;br&gt;to provide a strong basis in evidence. &lt;br&gt;     The remaining evidence upon which the School Committee &lt;br&gt;and the dissent relies   most notably the testimony of BLS &lt;br&gt;Headmaster Michael Contompasis and Dr. Melendez   likewise &lt;br&gt;exemplifies the shortcomings of anecdotal evidence.  One cannot &lt;br&gt;conclude from the isolated instances that these witnesses recounted &lt;br&gt;that low teacher expectations constitute a systemic problem in the &lt;br&gt;Boston public schools or that they necessarily relate to the dejure segregation of the past. &lt;br&gt;     Similarly unpersuasive are the School Committee's broad &lt;br&gt;generalizations about socialization.  Superintendent Payzant, for &lt;br&gt;example, testified that he believed that teachers who started &lt;br&gt;working in the era of dual school systems (who comprise &lt;br&gt;approximately 28 % of current faculty) had been \"socialized and &lt;br&gt;shaped\" by the thoughts and attitudes of the prior period.  This &lt;br&gt;may be so, but he gave no empirical evidence to confirm his &lt;br&gt;conclusion.  While the idea of \"socialization\" may be &lt;br&gt;intellectually elegant, courts must insist on seeing concrete &lt;br&gt;evidence.  Without such substantiation, Payzant's testimony is no &lt;br&gt;more compelling than the conclusory statements of the Richmond city &lt;br&gt;councillor rejected as insufficient by the Supreme Court in Croson, &lt;br&gt;488 U.S. at 500-01. &lt;br&gt;     To the extent that the School Committee notes other &lt;br&gt;causal factors or indicia of discrimination, they, too, are  &lt;br&gt;insufficient either to show ongoing vestiges of system-wide &lt;br&gt;discrimination or to justify a race-conscious remedy.  For &lt;br&gt;instance, pointing to the instability of leadership at the &lt;br&gt;superintendent level, the School Committee suggests   so far as we &lt;br&gt;can gather; the argument is neither developed nor clear   that it &lt;br&gt;led to the absence of a standardized curriculum, which in turn has &lt;br&gt;contributed to the achievement gap.  If the argument is that the &lt;br&gt;superintendent's office had a revolving door and thereby caused the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap, then we see nothing that helps advance the &lt;br&gt;contention that the achievement gap is a vestige of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  If the argument is that the superintendent's &lt;br&gt;office has tacitly endorsed disparate curricula which in turn have &lt;br&gt;caused the achievement gap, then the School Committee has provided &lt;br&gt;us with absolutely no evidentiary basis to conclude that this is a &lt;br&gt;consequence of discrimination; among other things, it has failed &lt;br&gt;either to identify which curricula were discriminatory or to &lt;br&gt;explain why they were so.  It likewise has failed to identify the &lt;br&gt;schools that adopted the discriminatory curricula in order to &lt;br&gt;suggest a relationship between race and the existence of &lt;br&gt;substandard school programs.  Thus, it is impossible to tell, even &lt;br&gt;on the assumption that differing curricula caused the achievement &lt;br&gt;gap, whether this was a consequence of discriminatory conduct.  In &lt;br&gt;a nutshell, there is not a shred of evidence in the record &lt;br&gt;supporting the contention that unstable leadership and the absence &lt;br&gt;of uniform curriculum standards bore any relationship either to &lt;br&gt;discrimination in the Boston schools or to the existence of the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap. &lt;br&gt;     We add an eschatocol of sorts.  Even if the School &lt;br&gt;Committee had proven the requisite connection between the Policy &lt;br&gt;and the vestiges of past discrimination, the Policy could not &lt;br&gt;endure.  When authorized by the Constitution, race-conscious &lt;br&gt;remedies not only must respond to a compelling governmental &lt;br&gt;interest, but also must be narrowly tailored to rectify the &lt;br&gt;specific harms in question.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 &lt;br&gt;(explaining that any race-conscious means adopted to remedy past &lt;br&gt;discrimination must be so narrowly tailored that there is \"little &lt;br&gt;or no possibility that the motive for the classification was &lt;br&gt;illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype\").  Under this test, &lt;br&gt;the Policy sweeps too broadly. &lt;br&gt;     We limit our remarks in this regard to three points.  &lt;br&gt;First, since there is no discrimination at entry to BLS, we fail to &lt;br&gt;see how the adoption of an admissions policy that espouses a brand &lt;br&gt;of proportional representation is designed to ameliorate the harm &lt;br&gt;that allegedly has occurred (a system-wide achievement gap at the &lt;br&gt;primary school level).  Indeed, when Deputy Superintendent Jackson &lt;br&gt;was asked whether the flexible racial/ethnic guidelines in any way &lt;br&gt;affect low teacher expectations, she responded that it was a &lt;br&gt;\"complicated question to answer\" because, given the relatively &lt;br&gt;recent implementation of the guidelines, there had \"not even been &lt;br&gt;an opportunity to check that.\"  If a high-level school official &lt;br&gt;cannot confirm that a race-conscious remedy will alleviate the &lt;br&gt;purported major cause of a remnant of discrimination, we do not &lt;br&gt;comprehend how that means can be narrowly tailored. &lt;br&gt;     Second, the increased admission of black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students cannot be viewed as partial compensation for injustices &lt;br&gt;done at the primary school level.  This is so because the victims &lt;br&gt;of the achievement gap are public school students, and they are the &lt;br&gt;ones who ought to be the focus of the remedy.  The Policy does not &lt;br&gt;focus in this direction, for many of the black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students admitted under it come from private or parochial schools.  &lt;br&gt;Thus, the Policy is not sufficiently particularized toward curing &lt;br&gt;the harm done to the class of actual victims.  See Podberesky v. &lt;br&gt;Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 158-59 (4th Cir. 1994).  After all, there is &lt;br&gt;no reason to assume that granting a remedy to one member of a &lt;br&gt;particular race or ethnic group comprises a condign remedy for harm &lt;br&gt;done to another, especially when those who have been harmed are &lt;br&gt;easily identifiable and still within the institution that allegedly &lt;br&gt;suffers from the vestiges of past discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     Third, if palliating the effects of past discrimination &lt;br&gt;is the ostensible justification for the Policy, then the Policy, on &lt;br&gt;its face, has been crafted in puzzling ways.  Suppose that in a &lt;br&gt;particular year a group of Hispanic students does very well, such &lt;br&gt;that they cluster between ranks 45 and 90, but that the Hispanic &lt;br&gt;student population in the RQAP is sparse.  Suppose further that &lt;br&gt;whites and Asians form a significant majority of the RQAP.  There &lt;br&gt;is then a likelihood that, by reason of the Policy, a number of the &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students   archetypal victims of discrimination   will be &lt;br&gt;displaced by white and Asian students.  Nor need we resort to &lt;br&gt;hypotheticals to see such effects.  At the O'Bryant School, the &lt;br&gt;Policy's flexible racial/ethnic guidelines resulted in the &lt;br&gt;rejection from the 1997 ninth-grade entering class of two Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students in favor of a white student.  Then, too, given the School &lt;br&gt;Committee's position that Asian students have not been victims of &lt;br&gt;discrimination, we are unable to comprehend the remedial purpose of &lt;br&gt;admitting Asian students over higher-ranking white students, as &lt;br&gt;happened in the case of Sarah Wessmann.  This brings us back to the &lt;br&gt;point of our beginning:  in structure and operation, the Policy &lt;br&gt;indicates that it was not devised to assuage past harms, but that &lt;br&gt;it was simply a way of assuring racial/ethnic balance, howsoever &lt;br&gt;defined, in each examination school class.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;506 (\"The random inclusion of racial groups that, as a practical &lt;br&gt;matter, may never have suffered from discrimination in the &lt;br&gt;construction industry in Richmond suggests that perhaps the city's &lt;br&gt;purpose was not in fact to remedy past discrimination.\").  The &lt;br&gt;Constitution forbids such a focus. &lt;br&gt;III.  CONCLUSION &lt;br&gt;     We do not write on a pristine page.  The Supreme Court's &lt;br&gt;decisions in Croson and Adarand indicate quite plainly that a &lt;br&gt;majority of the Justices are highly skeptical of racial preferences &lt;br&gt;and believe that the Constitution imposes a heavy burden of &lt;br&gt;justification on their use.  Croson, in particular, leaves no doubt &lt;br&gt;that only solid evidence will justify allowing race-conscious &lt;br&gt;action; and the unsystematic personal observations of government &lt;br&gt;officials will not do, even if the conclusions they offer sound &lt;br&gt;plausible and are cloaked in the trappings of social science.    &lt;br&gt;See Hayes, 10 F.3d at 214 (noting the dangers of relying on &lt;br&gt;\"subjective evidence\" to justify race-conscious policies); see alsoWittmer, 87 F.3d at 919 (reminding us that \"common sense &lt;br&gt;undergirded the pernicious discrimination against blacks now &lt;br&gt;universally regretted\"). &lt;br&gt;     Our dissenting brother's valiant effort to read into &lt;br&gt;Croson a broad discretion for government entities purporting to &lt;br&gt;ameliorate past discrimination strikes us as wishful thinking.  The &lt;br&gt;Croson Court's own reference to the need for a \"searching judicial &lt;br&gt;inquiry,\" 488 U.S. at 493, and its rejection of Justice Marshall's &lt;br&gt;position, see id. at 494-95; id at 535-36 (Marshall, J., &lt;br&gt;dissenting), both suggest an attitude that is antipathetic to those &lt;br&gt;who yearn for discretion.  And unless and until the Justices &lt;br&gt;reconfigure their present doctrine, it is the job of judges in &lt;br&gt;courts such as this to respect the letter and spirit of the Supreme &lt;br&gt;Court's pronouncements. &lt;br&gt;     We need go no further.  While we appreciate the &lt;br&gt;difficulty of the School Committee's task and admire the values &lt;br&gt;that it seeks to nourish, noble ends cannot justify the deployment &lt;br&gt;of constitutionally impermissible means.  Since Boston Latin &lt;br&gt;School's admissions policy does not accord with the equal &lt;br&gt;protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, we strike it &lt;br&gt;down.  The judgment of the district court must therefore be &lt;br&gt;reversed. &lt;br&gt;     We are mindful that Henry Wessmann asks not only that we &lt;br&gt;declare the Policy unconstitutional   which we have done   but also &lt;br&gt;that his daughter, Sarah, be admitted to BLS forthwith.  The School &lt;br&gt;Committee, which has vigorously defended the Policy, has tacitly &lt;br&gt;conceded that, if its defense fails, Sarah should be allowed to &lt;br&gt;enroll at BLS.  The circumstances of this case are unusual, for the &lt;br&gt;school year is under way and Sarah Wessmann   who already has spent &lt;br&gt;elsewhere the first year and some months of what normally would be &lt;br&gt;a four-year matriculation at BLS   does not have the luxury of time &lt;br&gt;that a remand would entail.  We therefore direct the district court &lt;br&gt;to enter a judgment, in appropriate form, that, inter alia, &lt;br&gt;commands Sarah's admission to BLS without delay. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reversed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                     Separate Opinions Follow  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring.  Judge Selya's opinion &lt;br&gt;demonstrates that the school committee plan under attack here does &lt;br&gt;involve racial preference, whatever the complexity of the plan and &lt;br&gt;subtlety in expression.  Yet, this court concluded more than a &lt;br&gt;decade ago that purposeful discrimination had ended so far as &lt;br&gt;assignments were concerned and that the school committee was &lt;br&gt;proceeding in good faith.  See Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d 313, 326 &lt;br&gt;n.19 (1st Cir. 1987).  To survive, the school committee's plan must &lt;br&gt;serve a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to &lt;br&gt;achieve that interest.  Croson, 488 U.S. at 505-08; Wygant, 476 &lt;br&gt;U.S. at 274. &lt;br&gt;     The foremost interest urged by the school committee is &lt;br&gt;diversity, a ground that may or may not prove \"compelling\" to the &lt;br&gt;Supreme Court.  But even if diversity were an adequate ground, it &lt;br&gt;has not been shown that this plan is necessary to achieve it.  The &lt;br&gt;record shows that minorities will be included in BLS in substantial &lt;br&gt;numbers without the plan.  Op. at 20-21.  If some specific higher &lt;br&gt;level is needed to achieve diversity of views and backgrounds, this &lt;br&gt;has not been demonstrated in the record. &lt;br&gt;     The alternative interest urged on this record is that the &lt;br&gt;plan is necessary to remedy the residual effects of admitted past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  The remnants on which the school committee relies &lt;br&gt;are supposed teacher attitudes, specifically, a lower expectation &lt;br&gt;of achievement by minorities in the Boston public schools.  These &lt;br&gt;attitudes are said to be linked backward in time to mind-sets &lt;br&gt;developed during a regime of purposeful discrimination and forward &lt;br&gt;to explain poorer performance by minority public-school students on &lt;br&gt;the tests necessary for entry into the elite public schools.  The &lt;br&gt;remedy is the racial preference embodied in the plan. &lt;br&gt;     In theory, low expectations could be caused by past &lt;br&gt;discrimination and could have some effect on current performance.  &lt;br&gt;But here the quality of the supporting evidence is far from &lt;br&gt;overwhelming.  In this case, there is no study of Boston schools, &lt;br&gt;only one for Kansas City; and the evidence as to Boston, while &lt;br&gt;offered through experts, is largely based on general statements or &lt;br&gt;anecdote.  It is open to question whether such evidence can &lt;br&gt;withstand Croson's requirement of a \"searching judicial inquiry.\"  &lt;br&gt;Croson, 480 U.S. at 493. &lt;br&gt;     In all events, the plan fails to meet the Supreme Court's &lt;br&gt;narrow tailoring requirement.  The plan is clearly overbroad when &lt;br&gt;judged by the past-discrimination rationale; it provides &lt;br&gt;preferences to minority groups that were never discriminated &lt;br&gt;against by the Boston School authorities or affected by lowered &lt;br&gt;expectations of public school teachers (Asians and private school &lt;br&gt;African-American applicants in particular).  See Croson, 488 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 506; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 284 n.13.  There is some reason to &lt;br&gt;think that African-American private school applicants rather than &lt;br&gt;public school students, may well be the principal beneficiary of &lt;br&gt;the preferences created by the plan. &lt;br&gt;     There is also no indication that the plan will do &lt;br&gt;anything to alter the expectations of public-school teachers, which &lt;br&gt;are claimed to be the source of the residual discrimination.  One &lt;br&gt;of the school committee's own experts, asked to say whether or how &lt;br&gt;the plan would resolve this problem, was unable to supply an &lt;br&gt;answer.  Op. at 49.  Another school committee expert, answering a &lt;br&gt;direct question from the judge as to whether the plan's racial &lt;br&gt;preference \"attacked the problem of teacher attitude,\" essentially &lt;br&gt;conceded that it did not.  Tr. 6-126 to -127.  These admissions &lt;br&gt;suggest a further misfit between plan and remedy. &lt;br&gt;     Finally, because the plan does not address the supposed &lt;br&gt;cause of the problem, teacher attitudes formed in the ancien &lt;br&gt;regime, the same arguments now urged to sustain the plan will be &lt;br&gt;available for the indefinite future.  Teachers retire slowly and &lt;br&gt;themselves teach those who succeed them.  The plan thus creates &lt;br&gt;just the kind of \"timeless\" racial preferences of concern to the &lt;br&gt;Supreme Court.  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 276; see Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;498, 505; cf. United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 178 (1987). &lt;br&gt;     None of these defects of fit is surprising because, at &lt;br&gt;bottom, the plan is not seriously suited to be a temporary measure &lt;br&gt;to remedy low teacher expectations that are the supposed remnants &lt;br&gt;of discrimination.  It is instead a thoughtful effort to assist &lt;br&gt;minorities historically disadvantaged while, at the same time,  &lt;br&gt;preserving the essentially competitive character of the schools in &lt;br&gt;question.  So viewed, there is no misfit between problem and &lt;br&gt;remedy; the only misfit is with Croson's requirements for the use &lt;br&gt;of racial preferences, requirements that only the Supreme Court can &lt;br&gt;relax. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                    Dissenting Opinion Follows  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting. Under the Equal &lt;br&gt;Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, all racial or ethnic &lt;br&gt;classifications by government actors are highly suspect and will be &lt;br&gt;upheld only if they withstand strict judicial scrutiny. To meet the &lt;br&gt;strict scrutiny standard, a challenged racial classification must &lt;br&gt;serve a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly &lt;br&gt;tailored to achieve that goal. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. &lt;br&gt;Pea, 515 U.S. 200, 224-25 (1995). The Boston School Committee &lt;br&gt;argues that the Boston Latin admissions program serves two &lt;br&gt;compelling interests: promoting diversity in the public schools and &lt;br&gt;remedying the vestiges of past discrimination. The majority rejects &lt;br&gt;both arguments. Although I have reservations about the Committee's &lt;br&gt;diversity argument on the facts of this case, I have none about its &lt;br&gt;remedial argument. The district court properly found that the &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee had a strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;determining that the Boston Latin admissions program serves a &lt;br&gt;compelling government interest in remedying the effects of prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination, and that the program is narrowly tailored to &lt;br&gt;achieve that goal.  &lt;br&gt;     I will explain more fully my disagreement with the &lt;br&gt;majority by dividing my opinion into four parts: a summary of the &lt;br&gt;Boston schools desegregation litigation that is particularly &lt;br&gt;relevant to the development of the Boston Latin admissions program; &lt;br&gt;a description of the proper legal framework for analyzing the &lt;br&gt;evidence of the remedial interest; an analysis of the evidence &lt;br&gt;establishing that interest; and an analysis of the program's narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring. &lt;br&gt;                               I. &lt;br&gt;Some Relevant History &lt;br&gt;     Although the majority opinion provides an excellent &lt;br&gt;background statement placing the present dispute in perspective, I &lt;br&gt;wish to offer some additional background which more fully reveals &lt;br&gt;the antecedents of the Boston Latin admissions program in the long &lt;br&gt;history of court supervised desegregation of the Boston school &lt;br&gt;system. That court-supervised desegregation began in 1974, when the &lt;br&gt;district court found that the Boston School Committee had engaged &lt;br&gt;in \"affirmative acts [which] intentionally created or maintained &lt;br&gt;racial segregation.\"  Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410, 427 (D. &lt;br&gt;Mass. 1974) (Morgan I). The Committee's acts included the &lt;br&gt;manipulation of facilities utilization, new school construction, &lt;br&gt;and redistricting to preserve distinctively white or minority &lt;br&gt;districts. See id. at 425-41. The district court noted that the &lt;br&gt;Committee was particularly successful in maintaining a segregated &lt;br&gt;school system through the establishment and use of \"feeder &lt;br&gt;patterns\" for students going from primary schools into the high &lt;br&gt;schools.  The primary schools were segregated in part because their &lt;br&gt;districts were geographically drawn and based on residentially- &lt;br&gt;segregated neighborhoods. As the high schools were far fewer in &lt;br&gt;number than the primary schools, and each high school drew on &lt;br&gt;several geographic primary school districts, the high schools might &lt;br&gt;naturally have been more racially balanced than the primary &lt;br&gt;schools. However, under the Committee's skewed feeder patterns, &lt;br&gt;students were assigned from white \"junior high\" schools into &lt;br&gt;predominantly white high schools beginning with the tenth grade, &lt;br&gt;and from African-American \"middle\" schools into predominantly &lt;br&gt;African-American high schools beginning with the ninth grade. Seeid. at 441-49. In the limited cases where students were allowed to &lt;br&gt;transfer voluntarily into schools with vacant seats, the Committee &lt;br&gt;manipulated the transfer program, alternately liberalizing it to &lt;br&gt;allow whites to transfer out of African-American schools, or &lt;br&gt;controlling it to keep African-Americans from transferring out of &lt;br&gt;African-American schools. See id. at 449-56. The district court &lt;br&gt;also found that the Committee took steps with regard to faculty and &lt;br&gt;staff assignment systemwide, and admission to the selective &lt;br&gt;citywide schools, in order to preserve the segregated status quo. &lt;br&gt;See id. at 456-69. &lt;br&gt;     Relying on the presumptive logic set forth in Keyes v.School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189 (1973), the district court &lt;br&gt;concluded that pervasive de jure segregation throughout the Boston &lt;br&gt;public school system established a \"prima facie case of unlawful &lt;br&gt;segregative design\" in the examination schools. Morgan I, 379 F. &lt;br&gt;Supp. at 467, quoting Keyes, 413 U.S. at 208.  This presumption was &lt;br&gt;not rebutted. See Morgan I, 379 F. Supp. at 467-68. Although little &lt;br&gt;evidence was presented on the causes of the exam schools' &lt;br&gt;imbalanced racial composition, the court attributed part of the &lt;br&gt;disparity to the tying of admission to achievement (as opposed to &lt;br&gt;aptitude) test scores.  The court also noted that the \"advanced &lt;br&gt;work classes\" that prepared public school fifth and sixth graders &lt;br&gt;for the examination schools were segregated. See id. at 433, 484 &lt;br&gt;n.16. On appeal, we summarized the situation as follows: \"The &lt;br&gt;examination schools are segregated because black children fare &lt;br&gt;worse on the entrance examinations than whites. These children are &lt;br&gt;products of the segregated elementary classes which constituted &lt;br&gt;'tracks' to the examination schools and were more than 80% &lt;br&gt;white. . . . Thus, the segregation of the lower schools had &lt;br&gt;inevitable consequences for the examination . . . schools . . . .\" &lt;br&gt;Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 F.2d 580, 594 n.20 (1st Cir. 1974) &lt;br&gt;(affirming Morgan I). &lt;br&gt;     In the subsequent remedial phase of the desegregation &lt;br&gt;litigation, the court considered a proposal to use the SSAT, an &lt;br&gt;aptitude rather than an achievement test, as part of the admissions &lt;br&gt;process for the exam schools. This test would presumably reflect &lt;br&gt;less of the disparity in elementary education among applicants &lt;br&gt;resulting from the segregation of their schools. See  Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Kerrigan, 401 F. Supp. 216, 243-44 (D. Mass. 1975) (Morgan II). &lt;br&gt;Although the district court also noted that there had been &lt;br&gt;discussion about using \"the median score as a floor for &lt;br&gt;admissions,\" id. at 243, the district court declined to set an &lt;br&gt;\"arbitrary\" examination-score minimum for the purpose of promoting &lt;br&gt;desegregation of the examination schools, imploring the parties to &lt;br&gt;work towards solutions themselves.  Id. at 244.  The then- &lt;br&gt;Headmaster of Boston Latin School stated in an affidavit that, in &lt;br&gt;his practical experience, the median score was a good minimum &lt;br&gt;standard for selecting students able to succeed at Boston Latin.  &lt;br&gt;Id. at 243.  While the Headmaster \"concede[d] that this standard &lt;br&gt;[was] an assessment based on his experience, not on racial data or &lt;br&gt;studies that would show that students scoring below that mark would &lt;br&gt;be unable to learn and succeed within the Latin schools' program,\" &lt;br&gt;id., this standard was accepted by the parties and has survived to &lt;br&gt;this day as the conclusion that the top half of the applicant pool &lt;br&gt;is \"qualified\" to succeed at Boston Latin. &lt;br&gt;     As a remedy for its finding of discrimination by the &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee, the court ultimately mandated that \"[a]t &lt;br&gt;least 35% of each of the entering classes at Boston Latin School, &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin Academy and Boston Technical High in September 1975 &lt;br&gt;shall be composed of black and Hispanic students.\"  Id. at 258. In &lt;br&gt;addition, the court imposed the following requirements: &lt;br&gt;     The School Department shall also institute and &lt;br&gt;     conduct programs (a) to make all students in &lt;br&gt;     the system aware of the admission requirements &lt;br&gt;     and type of instruction offered at the &lt;br&gt;     examination schools, and (b) to recruit black &lt;br&gt;     and Hispanic applicants to the examination &lt;br&gt;     schools in future years. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          Any tutorial programs given to prepare &lt;br&gt;     students for entrance examinations shall be &lt;br&gt;     conducted on a desegregated basis, as shall &lt;br&gt;     advanced work classes (if they are to be &lt;br&gt;     continued). Any enrichment and remedial &lt;br&gt;     programs for students admitted to or enrolled &lt;br&gt;     in the examination schools shall be available &lt;br&gt;     and conducted on a desegregated basis. There &lt;br&gt;     shall be no tracking of students within the &lt;br&gt;     examination schools which results in racially &lt;br&gt;     segregated classes. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Id. at 258-59. In reviewing the district court ruling, we concluded &lt;br&gt;that the 35% floor was not an impermissible racial quota because &lt;br&gt;\"overall racial composition [of the system was ordered] to be used &lt;br&gt;as a starting point in designing a school desegregation plan. This &lt;br&gt;approach is specifically approved in Swann [Swann v. Charlotte- &lt;br&gt;Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971)].\" Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401, 423 (1st Cir. 1976) (affirming Morgan II). &lt;br&gt;     The issue of racial composition was considered especially &lt;br&gt;important in the examination schools. For most other schools in the &lt;br&gt;system, the district court set minority enrollment targets only &lt;br&gt;within a broad statistical range. The racial/ethnic composition of &lt;br&gt;any individual school was allowed a 25% deviation from the average &lt;br&gt;racial/ethnic composition of the public school system as a whole. &lt;br&gt;Such a wide margin of error was not necessary or appropriate for &lt;br&gt;citywide schools (such as the examination schools) for two &lt;br&gt;reasons. First, the practical problems of implementing more &lt;br&gt;complete desegregation in these schools were less significant than &lt;br&gt;in the non-citywide schools, where additional busing was the main &lt;br&gt;instrument for additional desegregation of neighborhood-based &lt;br&gt;schools.  Although busing posed a hardship for students who might &lt;br&gt;otherwise have attended schools near their homes, most students &lt;br&gt;attending citywide schools were already being bused to school. &lt;br&gt;Second, minority enrollment at the citywide schools had to reflect &lt;br&gt;more accurately the racial/ethnic composition of the system because &lt;br&gt;the citywide schools were viewed as valuable vehicles for voluntary &lt;br&gt;desegregation that could not have \"[s]ignificant departures\" from &lt;br&gt;the overall composition and still attract students seeking an &lt;br&gt;integrated learning environment. See 530 F.2d at 423. The target &lt;br&gt;figure for overall African-American/Hispanic levels at the exam &lt;br&gt;schools, 35%, was set slightly lower than the percentage of &lt;br&gt;African-Americans and Hispanics in the system as a whole because &lt;br&gt;there was a significant population of Asians at the exam schools &lt;br&gt;already, bringing total levels of \"black and other minority\" &lt;br&gt;enrollment closer to the 44% rough target set for other citywide &lt;br&gt;schools. See Morgan II, 401 F. Supp. at 244. &lt;br&gt;     In 1987, some twelve years after the initial court &lt;br&gt;desegregation orders, we held that court supervision of student &lt;br&gt;assignments in the Boston schools should end in light of the &lt;br&gt;Committee's good faith, the State Board's findings of compliance, &lt;br&gt;and the general notion that the maximum practicable level of &lt;br&gt;desegregation had been achieved (given the impact of factors &lt;br&gt;exoteric to School Committee control, such as white flight). Morganv. Nucci, 831 F.2d 313 (1st Cir. 1987) (Nucci). In deference to the &lt;br&gt;longstanding national tradition of local school autonomy, control &lt;br&gt;over the student assignment process was returned to the Boston &lt;br&gt;School Committee, with the express reservation that \"'unitariness' &lt;br&gt;... in all aspects of the Boston schools has not yet been &lt;br&gt;achieved.\"  Id. at 318. Finally, in 1994 the district court issued &lt;br&gt;a \"Final Judgment\" in the Morgan litigation, and \"permanently &lt;br&gt;enjoined\" the Committee \"from creating, promoting or maintaining &lt;br&gt;racial segregation in any school or other facility in the Boston &lt;br&gt;Public school system.\" Morgan v. Burke, Civil Action 72-911G, (D. &lt;br&gt;Mass. July 19, 1994), at 5 (Morgan IV). &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee voluntarily continued the 35% &lt;br&gt;African-American/Hispanic set-aside at the exam schools even after &lt;br&gt;this policy ceased in 1987 (with Nucci) to be a court mandate. In &lt;br&gt;1996, however, the set-aside effectively ended with McLaughlin v. &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee, when the district court issued a &lt;br&gt;preliminary injunction ordering the admission to Boston Latin of a &lt;br&gt;student who challenged the set-aside's constitutionality. 938 F. &lt;br&gt;Supp. 1001 (D. Mass. 1996). In making that ruling, the court &lt;br&gt;acknowledged that &lt;br&gt;     the set aside had its origins in a court- &lt;br&gt;     ordered desegregation plan; that it had &lt;br&gt;     already played a crucial and successful role &lt;br&gt;     in desegregating the once virtually all-white &lt;br&gt;     examination schools; that the First Circuit &lt;br&gt;     had in no way called its validity into &lt;br&gt;     question in returning to the [Boston School &lt;br&gt;     Committee]control over student assignments; &lt;br&gt;     and that the appeals court had, if anything, &lt;br&gt;     strongly hinted that in-place corrective &lt;br&gt;     measures ought to be continued. Indeed, it may &lt;br&gt;     not be too much of a stretch to say that, &lt;br&gt;     without the set aside, there would not have &lt;br&gt;     been a finding of unitariness with respect to &lt;br&gt;     student assignments at all. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Id. at 1016. The court then warned that \"abandonment of the 35% set &lt;br&gt;aside at the present time without adopting other remedial measures &lt;br&gt;would, within the next six years or sooner, convert BLS into an &lt;br&gt;overwhelmingly white and Asian-American school with a black and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic enrollment of about 15%.\" Id. at 1008.  &lt;br&gt;     Nonetheless, the district court found a likelihood of &lt;br&gt;success for the disappointed white applicant Julia McLaughlin on &lt;br&gt;the narrow tailoring aspect of her challenge to the admissions &lt;br&gt;program. The district court cited the fact that \"the set aside &lt;br&gt;still does not have a built-in termination provision.\" Id. at 1016. &lt;br&gt;It also noted that the Boston School Committee did \"not appear to &lt;br&gt;have explored the feasibility of less racially preferential plans &lt;br&gt;for keeping BLS [the Boston Latin School] accessible to 'qualified' &lt;br&gt;students of all races and ethnicities, and not just to those &lt;br&gt;students who, for a myriad of reasons, tend to excel on &lt;br&gt;standardized examinations at the tender age of 12,\" even though &lt;br&gt;\"such plans may well be available for defendants' consideration.\"  &lt;br&gt;Id. The court offered as one possible alternative to the rigid 35% &lt;br&gt;set-aside a periodically updated target for minority enrollment, &lt;br&gt;with \"percentages [tailored] to the relevant qualified applicant &lt;br&gt;populations.\"  In light of the preliminary injunction, the &lt;br&gt;Committee replaced the set aside, and the district court's &lt;br&gt;suggestion of a floating target was influential in molding the set- &lt;br&gt;aside's immediate replacement, the current admissions program. &lt;br&gt;                              II. &lt;br&gt;The Legal Framework for an Analysis of the Evidence &lt;br&gt;     In rejecting the district court's conclusion that the &lt;br&gt;School Committee's current admissions program for Boston Latin &lt;br&gt;\"appropriately addressed the vestiges of discrimination that linger &lt;br&gt;in the Boston Public School system,\" Wessmann v. Boston School &lt;br&gt;Committee, 996 F. Supp. 120, 131 (D. Mass. 1998), the majority &lt;br&gt;asserts that the School Committee failed to present satisfactory &lt;br&gt;evidence of a causal connection between the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;documented by the Committee and the prior de jure segregation of &lt;br&gt;the Boston schools. I disagree with this conclusion. In my view, &lt;br&gt;the majority judges the Committee's proof of causation &lt;br&gt;unsatisfactory because the majority misperceives the Committee's &lt;br&gt;evidentiary burden in defending its affirmative action program. &lt;br&gt;That point requires some elaboration. &lt;br&gt;     The law is clear that a public entity adopting an &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program to remedy the lingering effects of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination must have a \"strong basis in evidence\" for &lt;br&gt;concluding that the lingering effects it identifies are causally &lt;br&gt;linked to past discrimination. See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson &lt;br&gt;Co., 488 U.S. 469, 500 (1989) (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of &lt;br&gt;Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion)).  The more &lt;br&gt;elusive question is what factual predicate constitutes a \"strong &lt;br&gt;basis in evidence\" justifying action by the public entity. From my &lt;br&gt;reading of the relevant caselaw, I conclude that this \"strong &lt;br&gt;basis\" requirement is met preliminarily if the public entity whose &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program is challenged in court demonstrates that &lt;br&gt;the entity adopted the program on the basis of evidence sufficient &lt;br&gt;to establish a prima facie case of a causal link between past &lt;br&gt;discrimination and the current outcomes addressed by the remedial &lt;br&gt;program. If this prima facie case is not effectively rebutted by a &lt;br&gt;reverse discrimination plaintiff, the public entity has met its &lt;br&gt;burden of establishing a compelling remedial interest. I now turn &lt;br&gt;to an analysis of the cases. &lt;br&gt;     There are no educational context reverse-discrimination &lt;br&gt;opinions from the Supreme Court which give us authoritative &lt;br&gt;guidance on what constitutes a strong basis in the evidence &lt;br&gt;sufficient to warrant remedial action. Contrary to the view of the &lt;br&gt;majority, I think it is appropriate to look to analogous cases from &lt;br&gt;the employment context. In that context, the Supreme Court has &lt;br&gt;required that  &lt;br&gt;     a public employer . . . must ensure that, &lt;br&gt;     before it embarks on an affirmative-action &lt;br&gt;     program, it has convincing evidence that &lt;br&gt;     remedial action is warranted. That is, it must &lt;br&gt;     have sufficient evidence to justify the &lt;br&gt;     conclusion that there has been prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;     Evidentiary support . . . becomes crucial when &lt;br&gt;     the remedial program is challenged in &lt;br&gt;     court. . . . In such a case, the trial court &lt;br&gt;     must make a factual determination that the &lt;br&gt;     employer had a strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;     its conclusion that remedial action was &lt;br&gt;     necessary. . . .  [U]nless such a &lt;br&gt;     determination is made, an appellate &lt;br&gt;     court . . . cannot determine whether the race- &lt;br&gt;     based action is justified as a remedy for &lt;br&gt;     prior discrimination. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277-78 (1986) &lt;br&gt;(Powell, J., plurality opinion) (emphasis added). In his earlier &lt;br&gt;opinion in Bakke, Justice Powell (joined by no other Justices on &lt;br&gt;this point) had stated that a \"judicial, legislative or &lt;br&gt;administrative\" finding of prior discrimination was an absolute &lt;br&gt;precondition to establishing a remedial program. Regents of the &lt;br&gt;Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 307-09 (1978).  &lt;br&gt;Concerned that this requirement of a prior finding might be read &lt;br&gt;into Justice Powell's opinion in Wygant, Justice O'Connor wrote in &lt;br&gt;her concurring opinion in Wygant that \"a contemporaneous or &lt;br&gt;antecedent finding of past discrimination by a court or other &lt;br&gt;competent body is not a constitutional prerequisite to a public &lt;br&gt;employer's voluntary agreement to an affirmative action plan.\" &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 289 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Although it may &lt;br&gt;seem excessively semantic to distinguish between the prerequisite &lt;br&gt;of a court or other competent body's contemporaneous or antecedent &lt;br&gt;finding of past discrimination to justify a voluntary affirmative &lt;br&gt;action program, and the lesser prerequisite of a public entity's &lt;br&gt;strong basis in evidence for concluding that such remedial action &lt;br&gt;is necessary, there is actually much at stake in that distinction. &lt;br&gt;As Justice O'Connor noted in her concurrence in Wygant: &lt;br&gt;     ...[P]ublic employers are trapped between the &lt;br&gt;     competing hazards of liability to minorities &lt;br&gt;     if affirmative action is not taken to remedy &lt;br&gt;     apparent employment discrimination and &lt;br&gt;     liability to nonminorities if affirmative &lt;br&gt;     action is taken. Where these employers, who &lt;br&gt;     are presumably fully aware both of their duty &lt;br&gt;     under federal law to respect the rights of all &lt;br&gt;     their employees and of their potential &lt;br&gt;     liability for failing to do so, act on the &lt;br&gt;     basis of information which gives them a &lt;br&gt;     sufficient basis for concluding that remedial &lt;br&gt;     action is necessary, a . . . requirement [that &lt;br&gt;     they have a court's actual finding of their &lt;br&gt;     own past discrimination before they act] &lt;br&gt;     should not be necessary. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 291 (O'Connor, J., concurring). This concern &lt;br&gt;for the vulnerable position of a public entity with a remedial duty &lt;br&gt;led Justice O'Connor to conclude that such an entity should not &lt;br&gt;have to wait for its own liability to minorities to be proved &lt;br&gt;conclusively in litigation before it could undertake remedial &lt;br&gt;action.  &lt;br&gt;     These concerns were again reflected in Justice O'Connor's &lt;br&gt;concurrence in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, 480 U.S. 616 &lt;br&gt;(1987). In Johnson, the Court upheld a voluntary affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program instituted by a local transportation agency. The program &lt;br&gt;allowed, inter alia, the agency to consider gender as a factor in &lt;br&gt;the applicant's qualifications for employment.  In her concurrence, &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor noted that \"[w]hile employers must have a firm &lt;br&gt;basis for concluding that remedial action is necessary . . .  &lt;br&gt;Wygant . . .  [does not] place[] a burden on employers to prove &lt;br&gt;that they actually discriminated against women or minorities.\" Id.at 652 (O'Connor, J., concurring). She explained that an employer &lt;br&gt;would have a firm basis in the evidence, sufficient to justify &lt;br&gt;remedial action, \"if it can point to a statistical disparity &lt;br&gt;sufficient to support a prima facie claim under Title VII by &lt;br&gt;employee beneficiaries of the affirmative action plan of a pattern &lt;br&gt;or practice claim of discrimination.\" Id. at 649.  &lt;br&gt;     Justice O'Connor incorporated these standards from her &lt;br&gt;Wygant and Johnson concurrences into an opinion for a majority of &lt;br&gt;the Court only a few years later in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson &lt;br&gt;Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989). In Croson, the Court invalidated a &lt;br&gt;minority subcontracting preference voluntarily instituted by the &lt;br&gt;city of Richmond because the city had not shown \"any identified &lt;br&gt;discrimination in the Richmond construction industry.\" Id. at 505. &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor stated that the city had failed to justify its &lt;br&gt;remedial goals with a \"'strong basis in evidence.'\" Id. at 500 &lt;br&gt;(citation omitted). The city had produced \"nothing approaching a &lt;br&gt;prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation by &lt;br&gt;anyone in the Richmond construction industry\" sufficient to justify &lt;br&gt;the city's use of subcontracting preferences to remedy its own role &lt;br&gt;in perpetuating that discrimination. Id. ( III-B, opinion of the &lt;br&gt;court) (emphasis added). If the city had presented evidence &lt;br&gt;supporting a prima facie claim under Title VII by the minority &lt;br&gt;subcontractors, remedial action would have been warranted. In the &lt;br&gt;absence of this evidence, the preference was an illegitimate racial &lt;br&gt;classification. &lt;br&gt;     In Stuart v. Roache, 951 F.2d 446 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. &lt;br&gt;denied, 504 U.S. 913 (1992), we relied on Croson in discussing the &lt;br&gt;burden of proof required of a public entity to justify a voluntary &lt;br&gt;affirmative action plan giving minority police officers a &lt;br&gt;preference in promotion to sergeant. We stated that \"[a] majority &lt;br&gt;of the Supreme Court in Croson used the words 'strong basis' and &lt;br&gt;'prima facie case' in [the context of voluntary race-conscious &lt;br&gt;remedial action by a public entity.] Hence, that is the evidentiary &lt;br&gt;standard that we use.\" 951 F.2d at 450 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;500, and Wygant, 476 U.S. at 292). We noted in Stuart that the &lt;br&gt;presence of statistical disparities creating a prima facie case \"at &lt;br&gt;least casts doubt on the fairness of the promotion process and &lt;br&gt;requires further explanation\" by the reverse-discrimination &lt;br&gt;plaintiff. 951 F.2d at 451. To elaborate on this last statement, &lt;br&gt;we cited partially to this section of Justice O'Connor's &lt;br&gt;concurrence in Wygant: &lt;br&gt;     [A] public employer must have a firm basis for &lt;br&gt;     determining that affirmative action is &lt;br&gt;     warranted. . . . For example, demonstrable &lt;br&gt;     evidence of a disparity [between percentages &lt;br&gt;     of minorities on a staff and in a] relevant &lt;br&gt;     labor pool sufficient to support a prima facie &lt;br&gt;     Title VII pattern or practice claim by &lt;br&gt;     minority teachers would lend a compelling &lt;br&gt;     basis for a competent authority such as the &lt;br&gt;     School Board to conclude that . . . a &lt;br&gt;     voluntary affirmative action program is &lt;br&gt;     appropriate . . . . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          To be sure, such a conclusion is not &lt;br&gt;     unassailable.  If a voluntary affirmative &lt;br&gt;     action plan is subsequently challenged in &lt;br&gt;     court by nonminority employees, those &lt;br&gt;     employees must be given the opportunity to &lt;br&gt;     prove that the plan does not meet the &lt;br&gt;     constitutional standard this Court has &lt;br&gt;     articulated. However, as the plurality &lt;br&gt;     suggests, the institution of such a challenge &lt;br&gt;     does not automatically impose upon the public &lt;br&gt;     employer the burden of convincing the court of &lt;br&gt;     its liability for prior unlawful &lt;br&gt;     discrimination;  nor does it mean that the &lt;br&gt;     court must make an actual finding of prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination based on the employer's proof &lt;br&gt;     before the employer's affirmative action plan &lt;br&gt;     will be upheld . . . .  In \"reverse &lt;br&gt;     discrimination\" suits, as in any other suit, &lt;br&gt;     it is the plaintiffs who must bear the burden &lt;br&gt;     of demonstrating that their rights have been &lt;br&gt;     violated....[W]hen the Board introduces its &lt;br&gt;     statistical proof as evidence of its remedial &lt;br&gt;     purpose, thereby supplying the court with the &lt;br&gt;     means for determining that the Board had a &lt;br&gt;     firm basis for concluding that remedial action &lt;br&gt;     was appropriate, it is incumbent upon the &lt;br&gt;     nonminority teachers to prove their case;  &lt;br&gt;     they continue to bear the ultimate burden of &lt;br&gt;     persuading the court that the Board's evidence &lt;br&gt;     did not support an inference of prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination and thus a remedial purpose[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 292-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring). &lt;br&gt;     Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Wygant, relied upon by &lt;br&gt;us in Stuart, provides a clear statement of the strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence required of a public entity defending an affirmative &lt;br&gt;action employment program in court: if minority beneficiaries of a &lt;br&gt;voluntary program could, in the program's absence, have met the &lt;br&gt;initial burden of production in a Title VII pattern-or-practice &lt;br&gt;suit (a \"prima facie case\") on the basis of the evidence relied &lt;br&gt;upon by the public entity, then the entity is justified in &lt;br&gt;preemptively enacting a voluntary remedial affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program. Put another way, the \"strong basis in evidence\" required &lt;br&gt;of a government entity defending an affirmative action employment &lt;br&gt;program in court is comparable to the evidentiary burden imposed on &lt;br&gt;a minority plaintiff who makes a claim of a pattern or practice of &lt;br&gt;employment discrimination under Title VII. Both must meet the &lt;br&gt;standard for a prima facie case. In the reverse discrimination &lt;br&gt;context, however, the public entity defending a challenge to its &lt;br&gt;affirmative action employment program in court does so by &lt;br&gt;presenting the evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination &lt;br&gt;that a putative Title VII minority plaintiff might have presented &lt;br&gt;in a potential lawsuit. &lt;br&gt;     I must pause in this discussion of the relevant &lt;br&gt;employment discrimination case law to make two points which are &lt;br&gt;important to an understanding of the evidentiary burden of the &lt;br&gt;School Committee. The School Committee asserts that evidence of &lt;br&gt;differential success rates for African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students applying to the examination schools from the advanced work &lt;br&gt;classes in the Boston Public Schools, as compared to their white &lt;br&gt;and Asian classmates, and evidence that African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students apply to the examination schools at half the rate &lt;br&gt;of white and Asian students, without more, constitute a \"strong &lt;br&gt;basis in evidence\" sufficient to justify a remedial affirmative &lt;br&gt;action program. In its amicus brief, the NAACP asserts that &lt;br&gt;statistical evidence of the discriminatory effects of overreliance &lt;br&gt;at the exam schools on composite score as a basis for admission, &lt;br&gt;without more, provides a strong basis in evidence sufficient to &lt;br&gt;justify a remedial affirmative action program.  Both of these &lt;br&gt;disparate impact contentions are wrong because they do not account &lt;br&gt;for the centrality of proof of discriminatory animus in justifying &lt;br&gt;a race-conscious remedial program. That centrality accounts for &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor's reference to the strong basis in evidence &lt;br&gt;provided for race-conscious remedial action by a prima facie Title &lt;br&gt;VII pattern or practice claim. Unlike Title VII disparate impact &lt;br&gt;claims, Title VII pattern or practice claims require evidence of &lt;br&gt;discriminatory animus. In addition to providing evidence of &lt;br&gt;disparate impact as part of its strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;remedial relief, the reverse discrimination defendant must link &lt;br&gt;that disparate impact to discriminatory animus, whether recent, or, &lt;br&gt;as asserted in this case by the School Committee, rooted in a more &lt;br&gt;distant history of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     In the Supreme Court employment cases I have discussed, &lt;br&gt;the reverse discrimination defendant sought to establish that its &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program was necessary to remedy harm caused by &lt;br&gt;recent discrimination. The disadvantaged plaintiff challenged the &lt;br&gt;existence of the discrimination itself, not whether that &lt;br&gt;discrimination had actually harmed minorities. In response to that &lt;br&gt;challenge to the existence of the discrimination itself, Justice &lt;br&gt;O'Connor made the point in Wygant and Johnson that the public &lt;br&gt;employer did not have the burden of convincing the court of its &lt;br&gt;liability for prior unlawful discrimination, nor did the court have &lt;br&gt;to make a finding of prior discrimination based on the employer's &lt;br&gt;proof to uphold the affirmative action program. Instead, the public &lt;br&gt;employer only had to demonstrate that it had a strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence for concluding that there was prior discrimination. Prima &lt;br&gt;facie evidence of a Title VII pattern or practice claim that could &lt;br&gt;be brought by minority plaintiffs would be such evidence. &lt;br&gt;     In the instant case, where there is a long history of &lt;br&gt;court findings of discriminatory acts by the School Committee, &lt;br&gt;there is no dispute about the public entity's responsibility for &lt;br&gt;prior discrimination.  Instead, given the time lapse between those &lt;br&gt;court findings of discrimination and the claim that this &lt;br&gt;discrimination still disadvantages minorities, the issue in dispute &lt;br&gt;here is whether the vestiges of that prior discrimination now &lt;br&gt;affect minorities.  This showing necessarily requires evidence of &lt;br&gt;the existence of vestiges of the prior discrimination and of a &lt;br&gt;present harm to minorities.  It also requires evidence of causal &lt;br&gt;connections between the past discrimination and the claimed &lt;br&gt;vestiges, and between the vestiges and the present harm.  Through &lt;br&gt;these connections, the School Committee must show that the need for &lt;br&gt;remedial action was a consequence of the effects of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  Nevertheless, Justice O'Connor's strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence/prima facie analysis still defines the evidentiary burden &lt;br&gt;of the School Committee in presenting its proof of the causal &lt;br&gt;relationship between prior discrimination and the present effects &lt;br&gt;on minorities. &lt;br&gt;     The district court in the McLaughlin case recognized the &lt;br&gt;applicability of Justice O'Connor's evidentiary framework: &lt;br&gt;     [W]hile the party seeking to justify an &lt;br&gt;     affirmative action measure here the defendant &lt;br&gt;     BSC [Boston School Committee] defending use of &lt;br&gt;     the 35% set aside bears the initial burden of &lt;br&gt;     producing \"a strong basis in evidence\" in &lt;br&gt;     support of the measure, the \"ultimate burden\" &lt;br&gt;     of proof rests with the party challenging it &lt;br&gt;     to prove that it is unconstitutional. [citing &lt;br&gt;     Wygant] . . . [T]he burden on the BSC is &lt;br&gt;     merely one of production: it must demonstrate &lt;br&gt;     that there is \"a strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;     [its] conclusion that remedial action was &lt;br&gt;     necessary.\" [citing Concrete Works of Colo. v. &lt;br&gt;     Denver, 36 F.3d 1513, 1521-22 (10th Cir. &lt;br&gt;     1994)].  If it does so, the ultimate burden of &lt;br&gt;     proving that the evidence before the BSC did &lt;br&gt;     not reasonably support an inference of prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination . . . rests with the plaintiff. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McLaughlin, 938 F. Supp. at 1010. In the instant case, the Boston &lt;br&gt;School Committee had the burden of demonstrating to the court that &lt;br&gt;the evidence that impelled it to adopt the admissions program for &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin met the prima facie standard set forth by Justice &lt;br&gt;O'Connor in Wygant, Johnson and Croson and applied by us in Stuart: &lt;br&gt;that is, the Committee had to show that the evidence before it &lt;br&gt;would constitute a prima facie case of a constitutional or &lt;br&gt;statutory violation if brought by a putative minority plaintiff. If &lt;br&gt;this prima facie case was not effectively rebutted by Wessmann, who &lt;br&gt;always retains the burden of persuasion, the School Committee &lt;br&gt;prevails. &lt;br&gt;     The majority finds the School Committee's reliance on &lt;br&gt;cases addressing affirmative action plans designed to remedy &lt;br&gt;vestiges of past employment discrimination inapt. &lt;br&gt;     In this case, the \"barrier to entry\" &lt;br&gt;     comparable to those in the employment &lt;br&gt;     discrimination cases is BLS's requirement of &lt;br&gt;     an entrance examination and the resultant &lt;br&gt;     composite score and no one (least of all, the &lt;br&gt;     School Committee) claims that the examination &lt;br&gt;     or any component thereof is discriminatory in &lt;br&gt;     operation or effect, or that it would be &lt;br&gt;     discriminatory if it were used as the sole &lt;br&gt;     criterion for admission. Such a claim was &lt;br&gt;     central to our conclusion in Stuart, 951 F.2d &lt;br&gt;     at 451, and it is totally absent here. What is &lt;br&gt;     more, such a claim would make precious little &lt;br&gt;     sense in the context of the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;     argument, for standardized achievement tests &lt;br&gt;     (a component of the entrance examination) are &lt;br&gt;     the primary measure of the asserted &lt;br&gt;     achievement gap. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I disagree with this analysis. Precisely as in the employment &lt;br&gt;cases, there is an identifiable barrier to entry that could be &lt;br&gt;challenged by minority applicants in the event the race-conscious &lt;br&gt;aspects of the Boston Latin admissions program were elided. Amicus &lt;br&gt;curiae NAACP makes this claim on appeal; it tried doggedly to &lt;br&gt;intervene below; and its position explains why the School Committee &lt;br&gt;could not, in the context of litigation both current and &lt;br&gt;anticipated, freely admit that composite score ranking may have had &lt;br&gt;a discriminatory impact if used alone. Despite this constraint, &lt;br&gt;the School Committee did allude to the notion of discriminatory &lt;br&gt;impact, as already noted, and there was evidence presented at trial &lt;br&gt;that, for African-Americans and Hispanics, composite score was not &lt;br&gt;reliably correlated with future performance at BLS. The Committee &lt;br&gt;also took pains to indicate that its stipulation at trial that &lt;br&gt;Wessmann would have been admitted had a straight-rank-order system &lt;br&gt;been used was not a concession that such an admissions scheme was &lt;br&gt;acceptable. &lt;br&gt;     Although the admissions program challenged here was &lt;br&gt;\"voluntary,\" in the sense of not being impelled by the 1994 order &lt;br&gt;or any other court proceeding or consent decree, the mere act of &lt;br&gt;making a selection among students seeking admission to Boston Latin &lt;br&gt;exposed the Committee to legal action by minority students. As &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor characterized the analogous employment situation, &lt;br&gt;\"public employers are trapped between the competing hazards of &lt;br&gt;liability to minorities if affirmative action is not taken to &lt;br&gt;remedy apparent employment discrimination and liability to &lt;br&gt;nonminorities if affirmative action is taken.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;291 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The Wygant case dealt with racial &lt;br&gt;preferences in employment, an arena where the shadow of Title VII &lt;br&gt;suits by disappointed minority job seekers inevitably looms over a &lt;br&gt;public employer using selection criteria with the potential to &lt;br&gt;produce an unjustifiable \"disparate impact\" on minorities. The same &lt;br&gt;considerations apply in the context of a selective public secondary &lt;br&gt;school: the mere act of selection exposes the school system to &lt;br&gt;challenge from minorities based on the disparate impact of the &lt;br&gt;selection criteria used. Here, the relevant provision of federal &lt;br&gt;law is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000d &lt;br&gt;(West 1998), stating that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, &lt;br&gt;on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from &lt;br&gt;participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to &lt;br&gt;discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal &lt;br&gt;financial assistance.\" &lt;br&gt;     There was evidence produced at trial that any exclusive &lt;br&gt;focus on composite score in admissions had a disparate impact on &lt;br&gt;African-Americans and Hispanics. Although the ability of minority &lt;br&gt;plaintiffs to make colorable claims of Title VI violations would &lt;br&gt;not be sufficient to justify a race-conscious affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program (such claims would only be sufficient to force the &lt;br&gt;Committee to find some alternative to composite score rank order &lt;br&gt;admissions), the presence of the disparate impact underlying such &lt;br&gt;claims, when causally related to the history of de jure segregation &lt;br&gt;in the system, imposed on the School Committee a duty to ensure &lt;br&gt;that it did not violate the Constitution by using selection &lt;br&gt;criteria that perpetuated the effects of past governmental &lt;br&gt;discrimination. As already noted, the district court in McLaughlinwas skeptical of the legality of simply reverting to the use of &lt;br&gt;composite score ranking, stating just two years ago that &lt;br&gt;\"abandonment of the . . . set aside at the present time without &lt;br&gt;adopting other remedial measures would, within the next six years &lt;br&gt;or sooner, convert BLS into an overwhelmingly white and Asian- &lt;br&gt;American school . . . .\" 938 F. Supp. at 1008 (emphasis added).  &lt;br&gt;The Committee chose a remedial measure for admission to the Boston &lt;br&gt;Latin School in the wake of a long history of desegregation orders &lt;br&gt;and under the threat of Title VI suits by disappointed minority &lt;br&gt;applicants if no affirmative action were taken. &lt;br&gt;     Just as the courts have always encouraged consensual &lt;br&gt;resolutions to desegregation cases, Congress' intent to encourage &lt;br&gt;voluntary compliance with the requirements of Title VI (and VII, &lt;br&gt;for that matter) has always been a backdrop to the scheme of &lt;br&gt;evidentiary burdens the federal courts have placed on litigants &lt;br&gt;pursuant to that legislation. See Bakke v. Regents of the Univ. of &lt;br&gt;California, 438 U.S. 265, 336 (1978) (Brennan, White, Marshall, and &lt;br&gt;Blackmun, JJ., concurring in part) (Title VI); Johnson v. &lt;br&gt;Transportation Agency, 480 U.S. 616, 630 n.8 (1987) (Title VII). &lt;br&gt;Similarly, in cases where there may be a duty to counteract the &lt;br&gt;effects of past government discrimination, the Supreme Court has &lt;br&gt;set evidentiary standards that facilitate a voluntary remedy. A &lt;br&gt;government entity need not admit conclusive guilt for past &lt;br&gt;discrimination's current effects before going forward with a &lt;br&gt;remedial plan. Instead, it must satisfy the court that the evidence &lt;br&gt;before it established a prima facie case of a causal link between &lt;br&gt;past discrimination and the current outcomes addressed by the &lt;br&gt;remedial program. If this prima facie case is not effectively &lt;br&gt;rebutted by a reverse discrimination plaintiff, who always retains &lt;br&gt;the burden of proving the illegality of the affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program, the government has met its burden of establishing a &lt;br&gt;compelling remedial interest under strict scrutiny analysis. With &lt;br&gt;this legal framework in mind, I turn to an analysis of the evidence &lt;br&gt;on the vestiges of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;                              III. &lt;br&gt;The Evidence on the Vestiges of Discrimination &lt;br&gt;     The district court found that \"[t]he overwhelming &lt;br&gt;evidence presented at trial confirmed the Boston School Committee's &lt;br&gt;basis for concluding that remedial action was necessary . . . .\" &lt;br&gt;996 F. Supp. at 131.  The majority says we should exercise plenary &lt;br&gt;review of that decision, \"taking the statistical and anecdotal &lt;br&gt;evidence in the manner suggested by the School Committee.\"  I agree &lt;br&gt;with the majority's approach.  I disagree with its conclusion. &lt;br&gt;1. The Achievement Gap &lt;br&gt;     The evidence at trial revealed large gaps between African- &lt;br&gt;Americans and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on &lt;br&gt;the other, in admissions to the exam schools, and in achievement &lt;br&gt;and allocation of resources throughout the system. The most &lt;br&gt;significant of these is the persistent, static gap in achievement &lt;br&gt;between African-American and Hispanic students and white and Asian &lt;br&gt;students. The gap is measured by achievement test scores of fifth &lt;br&gt;and sixth graders on the Metropolitan Achievement Test and the &lt;br&gt;Stanford 9.  Expert witness analysis of the test results over a &lt;br&gt;several year period showed a persistent and relatively unchanging &lt;br&gt;gap in achievement in all subject matters which correlated with &lt;br&gt;race: African-American and Hispanic students fared much worse on &lt;br&gt;the tests than whites. The tests also revealed that, in general, &lt;br&gt;Asians fared worse than whites on language skills achievement.   &lt;br&gt;     The evidence also demonstrated that African-Americans and &lt;br&gt;Hispanics from the public schools apply to the examination schools &lt;br&gt;at half the application rate of other students in the public &lt;br&gt;schools. Even within the special advanced work classes which are &lt;br&gt;designed to prepare Boston public elementary school students for &lt;br&gt;the examination schools, African-Americans and Hispanics fared &lt;br&gt;worse in the examination schools' admissions process than whites. &lt;br&gt;Finally, there was evidence that African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;applicants to Boston Latin from private elementary schools do much &lt;br&gt;better in the admissions process than their Boston public school &lt;br&gt;counterparts. The existence of these \"gaps\" was undisputed at the &lt;br&gt;trial.   &lt;br&gt;2. The Relationship of the Achievement Gap to Prior Discrimination &lt;br&gt;     The Committee presented evidence of a connection between low &lt;br&gt;teacher expectations for minority students and low minority &lt;br&gt;performance on achievement tests.  The Committee presented further &lt;br&gt;evidence that these low teacher expectations for minority students &lt;br&gt;are prevalent in the Boston school system, and that this prevalence &lt;br&gt;is a vestige of the long years of segregation in the Boston school &lt;br&gt;system.  Given these connections between student achievement, &lt;br&gt;teacher expectations for students, and the impact of years of &lt;br&gt;segregation on these teacher expectations, the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;itself is a current and lingering effect of discrimination.  I will &lt;br&gt;now summarize the evidence on these connections. &lt;br&gt;(a) The connection generally between teacher expectations and &lt;br&gt;student performance &lt;br&gt;     Both Dr. William Trent and Deputy Superintendent Janice &lt;br&gt;Jackson testified that teacher expectations affected student &lt;br&gt;performance. Dr. Trent gave extensive testimony concerning the &lt;br&gt;research he performed for the Kansas City School District in &lt;br&gt;connection with the school's efforts to determine whether it had &lt;br&gt;remedied the vestiges of prior segregation in compliance with a &lt;br&gt;court order.  In this study, Dr. Trent relied upon \"climate &lt;br&gt;surveys\" comprehensive questionnaires distributed to teachers, &lt;br&gt;students and parents to evaluate and score teacher efficacy.  He &lt;br&gt;explained that teacher efficacy measures \"the sense that teachers &lt;br&gt;perceived themselves or their colleagues as able to make a &lt;br&gt;difference in their teaching activities, their perceptions that &lt;br&gt;their schools operate with a sense of fairness, that they have a &lt;br&gt;high regard for their students and student body, [and] that they &lt;br&gt;perceive their school as open and accessible. . . .\"   A higher &lt;br&gt;efficacy score indicated that the teachers considered themselves &lt;br&gt;able to make a difference in their teaching activities and that &lt;br&gt;they held their students in high regard.  The Kansas City study &lt;br&gt;showed that there was a correlation between high teacher efficacy &lt;br&gt;scores and higher student test performance, while low teacher &lt;br&gt;efficacy scores were associated with low student test performance. &lt;br&gt;      Deputy Superintendent Jackson also testified that teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations affect student performance.  Early in Jackson's career &lt;br&gt;she was specifically trained in TEASA (Teacher Expectations and &lt;br&gt;Student's Achievement) techniques.  TEASA's techniques were derived &lt;br&gt;from studies demonstrating that interactions of teachers with &lt;br&gt;students can convey whether the teachers believe that the students &lt;br&gt;are capable of performing at a high level.  Specifically, the &lt;br&gt;techniques attempt to focus the teachers on their unconscious &lt;br&gt;biases about low and high achievers, including how their racial &lt;br&gt;attitudes influence their expectations of the students.  For many &lt;br&gt;years, Jackson instructed teachers on these techniques and &lt;br&gt;conducted countless training sessions to demonstrate how teachers' &lt;br&gt;interactions with students, even at an unconscious level, can have &lt;br&gt;a significant impact on student performance. &lt;br&gt;     Superintendent Thomas Payzant echoed Trent's and Jackson's &lt;br&gt;statements: \"My experience is that if you set high expectations for &lt;br&gt;a student, they will try harder to reach the higher bar than if you &lt;br&gt;set low expectations where they will tend to be content that they &lt;br&gt;have met what they are expected to do and should be satisfied with &lt;br&gt;their accomplishment.\" &lt;br&gt;(b) Low expectations for minority students in the Boston School &lt;br&gt;System &lt;br&gt;     Deputy Superintendent Jackson described her numerous &lt;br&gt;opportunities to observe the interactions among students, teachers &lt;br&gt;and administrators in the Boston public schools. In fact, Jackson &lt;br&gt;testified that she observed between thirty and forty Boston public &lt;br&gt;schools in her first year as Deputy Superintendent and at least &lt;br&gt;another forty schools in the system her second year.  During these &lt;br&gt;classroom visits, she observed that teachers had different &lt;br&gt;expectations for the African-American and Hispanic children versus &lt;br&gt;the Asian and white children.  She saw incidents of unjustified &lt;br&gt;disciplinary action directed at minority students, and noted a &lt;br&gt;frequent failure of teachers to call upon African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students in class. She also saw recurring instances of &lt;br&gt;teachers withholding praise for minorities and treating them with &lt;br&gt;condescending laxity when calling upon them in class.  &lt;br&gt;     Noting the substantial disparity in the application rates of &lt;br&gt;African-American and Hispanic students compared with white and &lt;br&gt;Asian students to Boston Latin School, Dr. Trent connected these &lt;br&gt;low expectations for minority students described by Jackson to the &lt;br&gt;minority students' low test performance and low admissions rate at &lt;br&gt;the examination schools. Dr. Trent explained that \"[t]o the extent &lt;br&gt;teachers play a central role in encouraging and preparing students &lt;br&gt;to apply for one of the more valued resources in the Boston Public &lt;br&gt;Schools, [the difference in application rates] reflects a very &lt;br&gt;different rate of success with encouraging or facilitating black &lt;br&gt;and Hispanic students applying, in contrast to the rate at which &lt;br&gt;white and Asian students do.\" He elaborated on this point:  &lt;br&gt;          Based, again, on the commentary reported and &lt;br&gt;     recorded by Deputy Jackson in her deposition, and my &lt;br&gt;     interviews, and on the pattern of applicant disparity, as &lt;br&gt;     well as looking at the data in terms of the generation of &lt;br&gt;     applicants, and there's chartered information that shows &lt;br&gt;     the same schools, for example, that generate substantial &lt;br&gt;     numbers of white and Asian applicants are not as &lt;br&gt;     successful with generating comparable numbers or rates of &lt;br&gt;     applicants for black and Hispanic students. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;          These suggest patterns of differential treatment or &lt;br&gt;     encouragement, or success, at least, with those black &lt;br&gt;     students, some of which is likely attributable to &lt;br&gt;     differential expectations, particularly within the &lt;br&gt;     commentary of the headmasters and the principals of the &lt;br&gt;     schools I had an opportunity to visit. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;(c) Low expectations for minority students as a vestige of prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination &lt;br&gt;      Dr. Trent provided the primary evidence on the causal link &lt;br&gt;between prior discrimination and low teacher expectations for &lt;br&gt;minority students and the effect of these low expectations on the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap. Dr. Trent tied these low expectations to the &lt;br&gt;lingering effects of a segregated school system.  He explained: \"It &lt;br&gt;appears that in the seniority ranks, as many as 28.4 percent of the &lt;br&gt;teachers currently employed in the district have been with the &lt;br&gt;district since prior to 1973, and about 47 percent have been with &lt;br&gt;the district from 1980 and prior.\"  These numbers indicated to Dr. &lt;br&gt;Trent that many of the teachers' attitudes towards their students &lt;br&gt;and expectations of them were shaped in a segregated school system. &lt;br&gt;Dr. Trent explained the difficulty of changing such teacher &lt;br&gt;attitudes following a desegregation order:  &lt;br&gt;          . . . [A]n organizational theory in research &lt;br&gt;     suggests that organizational change and organizational &lt;br&gt;     stability, particularly the climate of attitudes and &lt;br&gt;     dispositions within organizations, is a critical feature, &lt;br&gt;     and that generally recruitment hinges on socializing new &lt;br&gt;     members into the existing culture of the organization. So &lt;br&gt;     to the extent that there is this kind of faculty &lt;br&gt;     seniority and tenure in the district, we could be seeing &lt;br&gt;     the persistence of particular attitudes that predate or &lt;br&gt;     at least were shaped and developed during the period of &lt;br&gt;     intense contestations regarding the desegregation of the &lt;br&gt;     schools [in Boston]. And to the extent that there is &lt;br&gt;     little change, effort, professional development, and &lt;br&gt;     other sorts of efforts that would address those &lt;br&gt;     prevailing attitudes, you could have a persistence of &lt;br&gt;     those attitudes and the socialization of new individuals &lt;br&gt;     into those existing cultures. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;          School desegregation research has shown the &lt;br&gt;     importance of changing the composition of the makeup of &lt;br&gt;     the schools, the racial composition of faculty, and the &lt;br&gt;     importance of changing leadership, as well as providing &lt;br&gt;     professional development experiences in order to &lt;br&gt;     facilitate greater success with the desegregation effort. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on his interviews with school personnel, Dr. Trent testified &lt;br&gt;that there was no evidence that the school system had been &lt;br&gt;successful in counteracting the diminished expectations for &lt;br&gt;minority students. &lt;br&gt;     As noted by the majority, Dr. Trent did not conduct a specific &lt;br&gt;study of the Boston school system, as he had done for the Kansas &lt;br&gt;City School District, to evaluate whether teachers had different &lt;br&gt;expectations for minority students and whether those low &lt;br&gt;expectations were attitudinal remnants of the segregation era. In &lt;br&gt;lieu of such a study, Trent relied on the seniority statistics &lt;br&gt;discussed above as well as statistics relating to the different &lt;br&gt;student application rates to the exam schools, indicating a &lt;br&gt;substantial disparity between the application rates of African- &lt;br&gt;Americans and Hispanics compared to whites and Asians. He also &lt;br&gt;relied on statistics that show that African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students attending the Boston public schools receive invitations to &lt;br&gt;attend Boston Latin at a much lower rate than do African-Americans &lt;br&gt;and Hispanics attending private schools, whereas the invitation &lt;br&gt;rates for white and Asian private school and white and Asian public &lt;br&gt;school students were comparable. Finally, he relied on interviews &lt;br&gt;with headmasters, principals and other personnel, as well as an &lt;br&gt;interview with Deputy Superintendent Janice Jackson, who, as noted, &lt;br&gt;had special training in observing teacher interactions with &lt;br&gt;students, and had made a personal survey of over seventy schools in &lt;br&gt;the Boston school system over the course of two years.  Based on &lt;br&gt;this information, he offered his expert opinion that low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations for minorities, shaped in the segregation era, are a &lt;br&gt;cause of the current achievement gap, and thus the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;itself is a vestige of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     Superintendent Payzant also testified to vestiges of prior  &lt;br&gt;discrimination in the school system. He first explained that, prior &lt;br&gt;to 1973, there were  &lt;br&gt;     specific practices in the school district that resulted &lt;br&gt;     in students being assigned to schools that often led to &lt;br&gt;     particular races being represented in some schools and &lt;br&gt;     not others, practices that resulted in resources being &lt;br&gt;     unequally distributed so that there were disparities &lt;br&gt;     among the schools, disparities among the programs that &lt;br&gt;     were offered and the access and opportunity that students &lt;br&gt;     had to them . . . . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          . . . . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          And I cite that because I think the institutional &lt;br&gt;     history of the school district prior to 1973 was shaped &lt;br&gt;     by those practices.  And as I testified a moment ago, &lt;br&gt;     there is a significant percentage of teachers and other &lt;br&gt;     educators in the Boston Public Schools who really were &lt;br&gt;     socialized and shaped by the expectation that the &lt;br&gt;     institution had in the pre-1973 period.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He further explained the significance of this \"socialization\" in &lt;br&gt;the pre-1973 period: \"[W]hat was going on [pre-1973] was part of &lt;br&gt;what people saw as their normal working conditions and they learned &lt;br&gt;to function in those settings and, whether consciously or &lt;br&gt;unconsciously, accepted the practices that were occurring in many &lt;br&gt;instances.\"  He noted that  &lt;br&gt;     there was a disparity in terms of allocation of &lt;br&gt;     resources, access to programs, variation in quality from &lt;br&gt;     school to school, . . . [and] the result was that some  &lt;br&gt;     students were getting a higher quality education than &lt;br&gt;     others and often that was defined by race, and that was &lt;br&gt;     part of the background with respect to expectations that &lt;br&gt;     were set for what students could or could not do. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     Robert Gittens, Vice-Chair of the Boston School Committee, &lt;br&gt;also testified that the effects of segregation and prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination permeated the school system despite its efforts to &lt;br&gt;remedy the problem. He explained that he was often in contact with &lt;br&gt;African-American parents who complained of being alienated from the &lt;br&gt;school system. They also complained that their children were not &lt;br&gt;being motivated or challenged academically.  He noted, however, &lt;br&gt;that he did not hear these complaints from white parents.  He &lt;br&gt;further stated:  \"We have schools today that are overwhelmingly &lt;br&gt;black and Hispanic[.]  I believe that there is a pervasive sense &lt;br&gt;that there are kids in the system who cannot, will not . . . &lt;br&gt;succeed.\"  He elaborated:  &lt;br&gt;     I think that one of the things that has happened is we &lt;br&gt;     have a teaching force that has been in the system for a &lt;br&gt;     very long period of time.  And I think that there are &lt;br&gt;     large numbers of teachers who, and I've heard this from &lt;br&gt;     headmasters and principals and others, that there are &lt;br&gt;     teachers who say, \"I've been teaching this way for 20 or &lt;br&gt;     25 years.  Why should I change the way I teach?\" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;3. A prima facie case of causation &lt;br&gt;     The majority's criticisms of the Committee's evidentiary case &lt;br&gt;are twofold: 1) the Committee did not establish the presence of &lt;br&gt;differential teacher exceptions for minority students and 2) the &lt;br&gt;Committee failed to establish any causal connection between prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination and the achievement gap itself; that is, it failed &lt;br&gt;to establish that prior discrimination affected low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations for minority students and further failed to establish &lt;br&gt;that these low expectations were a cause of the achievement gap. I &lt;br&gt;respond to these criticisms in turn. &lt;br&gt;     The majority asserts that Dr. Trent's failure to conduct a &lt;br&gt;survey of the type conducted in Kansas City disabled him from &lt;br&gt;validly establishing that teachers had different expectations for &lt;br&gt;minority students.  Specifically, the majority criticizes Dr. &lt;br&gt;Trent's reliance on \"anecdotal\" evidence about teacher attitudes &lt;br&gt;supplied by school officials rather than the broad survey of &lt;br&gt;teachers in Kansas City.  Used pejoratively, the word \"anecdotal\" &lt;br&gt;describes accounts of isolated instances few in number. Used &lt;br&gt;descriptively, the word describes observational testimony that &lt;br&gt;could embrace many instances of a phenomenon.  We should be wary of &lt;br&gt;dismissing as \"anecdotal\" the extensive observational accounts of &lt;br&gt;experienced school administrators testifying about the prevalence &lt;br&gt;of different teacher expectations in their school systems, &lt;br&gt;particularly when, as in the case of Deputy Superintendent Jackson, &lt;br&gt;the administrator is trained to make such observations. &lt;br&gt;     Jackson had observed a large variety of classrooms before her &lt;br&gt;work in the Boston schools. As a result, her observations of over &lt;br&gt;seventy schools in the Boston school system over a two year period &lt;br&gt;were made within a broader frame of reference than those of the &lt;br&gt;individual teachers, students, and parents responding to the &lt;br&gt;surveys relied on by Dr. Trent in his Kansas City survey. Jackson's &lt;br&gt;extensive training in making such observations would allow her to &lt;br&gt;notice nuanced behavior that survey respondents would not have &lt;br&gt;discerned.  While the risk that the personal bias of the observer &lt;br&gt;will infect the results is greater when relying on data filtered &lt;br&gt;through a few observers, as opposed to data reported on paper by a &lt;br&gt;large number of survey respondents, Jackson was trained to make her &lt;br&gt;observations in a professional, objective manner.  Observations of &lt;br&gt;wide scope, reported by parties with training in methods of &lt;br&gt;objective observation, do permit generalization about \"pervasive,\" &lt;br&gt;\"systematic\" problems. &lt;br&gt;     The majority opinion and the concurrence contend that there is &lt;br&gt;a similarity between the evidence relied upon by the School &lt;br&gt;Committee and the evidence found inadequate by the Supreme Court in &lt;br&gt;Croson. I find this analogy unconvincing.  In Croson, there was no &lt;br&gt;evidence of local, industry-specific discrimination beyond the &lt;br&gt;statements of one councilperson to the effect that he was \"familiar &lt;br&gt;with the practices in the construction industry in this area,\" and &lt;br&gt;that in his experience \"the general conduct of . . . the industry &lt;br&gt;. . . is one in which race discrimination and exclusion on the &lt;br&gt;basis of race is widespread.\" Id. at 480. Such a vague &lt;br&gt;generalization led the Court to conclude that \"none of the evidence &lt;br&gt;produced by the city points to any identified discrimination in the &lt;br&gt;Richmond construction industry.\" Id. at 506. In this case, the &lt;br&gt;testimony of Trent, Jackson and others on the achievement gap, low &lt;br&gt;teacher expectations for minorities, and the causal connection to &lt;br&gt;prior discrimination in the Boston public schools was based on &lt;br&gt;extensive observations by skilled professionals of the conduct and &lt;br&gt;performance of students and teachers in the Boston schools, as well &lt;br&gt;as statistical evidence specific to those schools. &lt;br&gt;     The majority also asserts that \"Dr. Trent thus freely conceded &lt;br&gt;that the data he used [on teacher expectations] was not of the &lt;br&gt;quality necessary to satisfy the methodological rigors required by &lt;br&gt;his discipline.\"  I do not find this concession in Dr. Trent's  &lt;br&gt;testimony. In fact, during cross-examination, in response to a &lt;br&gt;question concerning whether it was reasonable for him to rely on &lt;br&gt;Deputy Superintendent Jackson's assessments of teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;in the Boston school system, Dr. Trent responded: \"In many &lt;br&gt;instances in the social sciences, qualitative researchers work with &lt;br&gt;information that is reported by the respondents. That is not &lt;br&gt;unusual.\"  Although a survey of teachers and other personnel in the &lt;br&gt;Boston school system would have provided a more substantial basis &lt;br&gt;for Dr. Trent's opinion on the existence of low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations for minorities, the absence of such empirical data &lt;br&gt;does not justify the majority's rejection of his testimony.   &lt;br&gt;     I also disagree with the majority that Trent's testimony &lt;br&gt;relied on \"evidence from one locality to establish the lingering &lt;br&gt;effects of discrimination in another\" in the manner criticized in &lt;br&gt;Croson.  Dr. Trent's expertise in identifying patterns of vestigal &lt;br&gt;effects of discrimination necessarily was acquired through his &lt;br&gt;prior studies of other school systems, including Kansas City.  He &lt;br&gt;did not attempt to use national statistics or statistics from other &lt;br&gt;localities to infer the existence of similar local conditions, as &lt;br&gt;was done by the city council in Croson.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;504. &lt;br&gt;     The Committee's evidence on the connection between prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination and low teacher expectations, and low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations and the achievement gap, was undeniably a mix of &lt;br&gt;statistical and anecdotal evidence. Although the majority finds &lt;br&gt;this mix unacceptable, courts have often held that statistical &lt;br&gt;evidence documenting a disparate impact or a pattern or practice of &lt;br&gt;disparate treatment can combine with anecdotal evidence of acts of &lt;br&gt;discrimination to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.  &lt;br&gt;     In International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, &lt;br&gt;431 U.S. 324, 334-38 (1977), statistical evidence on outcome &lt;br&gt;(namely, the low number of minority truck drivers compared to the &lt;br&gt;relevant qualified pool) was supported by individual testimony on &lt;br&gt;prior discrimination (over forty acts of explicit discrimination &lt;br&gt;against minority aspirants). These testimonials \"brought the cold &lt;br&gt;numbers convincingly to life.\"  Id. at 339. In Coral Construction &lt;br&gt;Co. v. King County, 941 F.2d 910, 919 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. &lt;br&gt;denied, 502 U.S. 1033 (1992), the Ninth Circuit warned of the &lt;br&gt;dangers of relying overly on either statistics or anecdotal &lt;br&gt;accounts, individually, to establish a widespread pattern of &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  Nonetheless, the court found that \"the combination &lt;br&gt;of convincing anecdotal and statistical evidence is potent.\" 941 &lt;br&gt;F.2d at 919.  In EEOC v. O &amp; G Spring and Wire Forms Specialty Co., &lt;br&gt;38 F.3d 872, 878 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1198 &lt;br&gt;(1995), statistical evidence established only that the employer in &lt;br&gt;question had no African-American employees; the anecdotal evidence, &lt;br&gt;limited to a sampling of four disappointed applicants, was relevant &lt;br&gt;to demonstrating discriminatory conduct. The plaintiffs &lt;br&gt;successfully established a prima facie case of a pattern or &lt;br&gt;practice of disparate treatment. In Ensley Branch, NAACP v. &lt;br&gt;Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass'n 117, 31 F.3d 1548, 1565 (11th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1994), the Eleventh Circuit stated that anecdotal evidence could be &lt;br&gt;\"used to document discrimination, especially if buttressed by &lt;br&gt;relevant statistical evidence.\" &lt;br&gt;     In the instant case, experienced school administrators and &lt;br&gt;officials, such as Superintendent Payzant and Vice-Chair Gittens, &lt;br&gt;offered their judgment, on the basis of extensive day to day &lt;br&gt;experience with the Boston school system, that there were links &lt;br&gt;between prior discrimination in the system, low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations, and the achievement gap. Dr. Trent offered his expert &lt;br&gt;opinion on these links without challenge to the admissibility of &lt;br&gt;his testimony.  He testified that his conclusions were based on a &lt;br&gt;reasonable methodology in his profession.  He evaluated statistics &lt;br&gt;documenting student performance and teacher histories in the Boston &lt;br&gt;school system. He studied the observations of a well-trained &lt;br&gt;administrator in the Boston school system describing teacher &lt;br&gt;performances in the classroom, the impact of these performances on &lt;br&gt;students, and faulty attempts to alter teacher attitudes. He knew &lt;br&gt;the history of segregation in the Boston school system.  Seeing &lt;br&gt;statistics and patterns in Boston that he had observed in other &lt;br&gt;school systems where he had found a link between student &lt;br&gt;achievement gaps and prior discrimination, he testified to the &lt;br&gt;probability of such a link in the Boston school system. He had an &lt;br&gt;adequate basis for making that judgment. &lt;br&gt;     The majority also finds fault with Dr. Trent's testimony, and &lt;br&gt;the Committee's case generally, because of the failure to control &lt;br&gt;for \"competing explanations for current realities.\" In the &lt;br&gt;majority's view, the Committee's evidence had to account for other &lt;br&gt;variables that might explain all or part of the achievement gap in &lt;br&gt;terms of societal discrimination. This insistence reflects a &lt;br&gt;misconception of the School Committee's evidentiary burden, and &lt;br&gt;would elevate the Committee's evidentiary burden far beyond the &lt;br&gt;prima facie standard contemplated in the Title VII cases.  The &lt;br&gt;Committee did not have to present proof that would permit the court &lt;br&gt;to make an independent finding of causation.  The Committee had to &lt;br&gt;satisfy the court that the Committee had before it a strong basis &lt;br&gt;in evidence for its judgment that the achievement gap is linked to &lt;br&gt;past discrimination in the Boston school system. As indicated by &lt;br&gt;the discussion of the Supreme Court and First Circuit precedents in &lt;br&gt;Part II, that strong basis is provided by a prima facie case of &lt;br&gt;causation. In voluntarily undertaking remedial measures, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee did not have to establish an airtight case for its own &lt;br&gt;liability to minority students. By setting the bar of proof for the &lt;br&gt;School Committee unrealistically high, the majority has ignored &lt;br&gt;precedents that impose only a prima facie burden on the School &lt;br&gt;Committee. &lt;br&gt;     Contrary to the majority, I believe that Boston Police &lt;br&gt;Superior Officers Federation v. City of Boston, 147 F.3d 13 (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1998), where we upheld an affirmative action program, supports &lt;br&gt;the conclusion that the School Committee satisfied its evidentiary &lt;br&gt;burden to justify the remedial measure. In Boston Police, we first &lt;br&gt;relied upon \"the BPD's history of racial discrimination [that] is &lt;br&gt;well-documented in the decisions of this court.\" Id. at 20. We &lt;br&gt;described the twenty years of litigation attempting to remedy the &lt;br&gt;department's discrimination against African-Americans. We relied &lt;br&gt;upon court findings made seven years prior to the litigation at &lt;br&gt;issue and specifically noted that \"we do not think this evidence is &lt;br&gt;too temporally remote to justify the conclusion that the BPD's past &lt;br&gt;racial discrimination has manifest effects in the present status of &lt;br&gt;black officers.\" Id.  We considered the statistical evidence that &lt;br&gt;demonstrated a continuing disparity between African-American and &lt;br&gt;white police officers being promoted to lieutenant positions.  We &lt;br&gt;then concluded:  &lt;br&gt;     This tortuous history, combined with the persistent &lt;br&gt;     effects of discriminatory practices at the entry and &lt;br&gt;     sergeant levels, sufficiently links the BPD's past &lt;br&gt;     discrimination and the statistical disparities &lt;br&gt;     contemporaneous with Ruiz's promotion.  Given the BPD's &lt;br&gt;     halting and, at times, quite modest progress in remedying &lt;br&gt;     its earlier discrimination, we are reluctant to infer &lt;br&gt;     that the vestiges of that discrimination had &lt;br&gt;     substantially disappeared when the BPD promoted Ruiz. The &lt;br&gt;     evidence warranted the district court's conclusion that &lt;br&gt;     the 1996 \"statistical disparity combines with judicial &lt;br&gt;     findings of past entry-level discrimination by the BPD to &lt;br&gt;     imply convincingly that historical discrimination has &lt;br&gt;     affected the promotion of minority sergeants to the rank &lt;br&gt;     of lieutenant, and that the lingering effects of that &lt;br&gt;     discrimination were present in 1995 when the BPD promoted &lt;br&gt;     Ruiz.\" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Id. at 22-23 (citations omitted).  Implicit in our decision in &lt;br&gt;Boston Police was the common sense proposition that a long history &lt;br&gt;of discrimination in a social institution affects for a &lt;br&gt;considerable period of time the attitudes and behavior of people &lt;br&gt;who have worked in that system.  Although such history, standing &lt;br&gt;alone, cannot provide the strong basis in evidence for a public &lt;br&gt;entity's adoption of an affirmative action program, it can &lt;br&gt;contribute to the evidentiary basis underlying the judgment that &lt;br&gt;there is a causal relationship between a current outcome, such as &lt;br&gt;an achievement gap, and past discrimination.  The Committee &lt;br&gt;appropriately invokes that history to support, in part, its &lt;br&gt;admission program for Boston Latin.  &lt;br&gt;     I am concerned that the majority's evidentiary requirements in &lt;br&gt;this case will force school systems contemplating affirmative &lt;br&gt;action programs designed to address the effects of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination to establish, through the collection of quantifiable &lt;br&gt;social science data, that past discrimination is the sole or &lt;br&gt;primary cause of variable achievement. Given the Supreme Court's &lt;br&gt;emphasis on the prima facie justification for such an initiative, &lt;br&gt;I conclude that \"substantial factor\" causation meets the causal &lt;br&gt;burden of production for a prima facie case. In his dissent in &lt;br&gt;Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), Justice &lt;br&gt;Stevens noted that under existing law the notion of a prima facie &lt;br&gt;case under Title VII contemplates a similar standard. As he put it, &lt;br&gt;the asserted causal link between the acts of an employer and the &lt;br&gt;harm to a Title VII plaintiff  \"must have substance\" but \"need not &lt;br&gt;constitute the sole or primary cause of the harm.\" Id. at 672-73 &lt;br&gt;(Stevens, J., dissenting).  This standard reflects the general tort &lt;br&gt;standard embodied in the Restatement; See Restatement (Second) of &lt;br&gt;Torts  430-433 (1965). As Justice Stevens also noted, it is &lt;br&gt;consistent with the views of a majority of Justices in Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). It is also consistent &lt;br&gt;with Congress' response to that decision in the 1991 Civil Rights &lt;br&gt;Act. &lt;br&gt;     The evidence presented by the School Committee established a &lt;br&gt;prima facie case that differential teacher expectations, grounded &lt;br&gt;in the long history of segregation in the Boston school system, &lt;br&gt;were a substantial causal factor in the undeniable achievement gap &lt;br&gt;found in the Boston school system. In the face of this evidence, &lt;br&gt;Wessmann had the burden of challenging the Committee's prima facie &lt;br&gt;case by disproving the alleged causal linkages between prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination, teacher expectations, and the achievement gap. &lt;br&gt;4. Plaintiff's evidence challenging the causal link &lt;br&gt;     Wessmann conceded the existence of the achievement gap but &lt;br&gt;attempted to rebut the causal explanation advanced by the Committee &lt;br&gt;by asserting a \"neutral explanation\" for the disparities (that is, &lt;br&gt;that they were due to socioeconomic conditions attributable, at &lt;br&gt;most, to societal discrimination). Wessmann's only witness on these &lt;br&gt;matters, Professor Stephan Thernstrom, hypothesized that three &lt;br&gt;variables poverty rates, levels of education, and family &lt;br&gt;structures might be the cause of the achievement gap in the Boston &lt;br&gt;system. He based his hypothesis on national statistical evidence &lt;br&gt;that demonstrates powerful relationships between low achievement &lt;br&gt;and poverty rates, levels of education and family structure. &lt;br&gt;Professor Thernstrom suggested that, if a controlled study had been &lt;br&gt;done to isolate the causes of the achievement gap, the study would &lt;br&gt;have revealed that any causal connection between the achievement &lt;br&gt;gap and teacher expectations was insignificant. He further rejected &lt;br&gt;the Committee's argument that low teacher expectations are &lt;br&gt;connected to prior discrimination on the basis that the Committee &lt;br&gt;did not conduct a study on this issue. &lt;br&gt;     During cross-examination, Professor Thernstrom acknowledged &lt;br&gt;that he had no data particular to Boston on any alternative causes &lt;br&gt;of the achievement gap, thus confirming his reliance on the &lt;br&gt;national statistics criticized by the Supreme Court in Croson.  He &lt;br&gt;also acknowledged that, in his recent book evaluating the causes of &lt;br&gt;a national achievement gap between students, he had written that &lt;br&gt;neither poverty rates, levels of education, nor family structure &lt;br&gt;could account for the national achievement gap between African- &lt;br&gt;American and white students. In fact, in a chapter titled \"Low &lt;br&gt;Expectations, Low Performance,\" he stated that \"ask little of &lt;br&gt;children in the way of academic achievement and little is what you &lt;br&gt;tend to get.\" In that chapter, he specifically cited actions of the &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee in 1990, and stated that the Boston public &lt;br&gt;schools \"were failing to do their job and most of all failing &lt;br&gt;African-American pupils.\" &lt;br&gt;     As the district court noted in its opinion, the one expert &lt;br&gt;witness to testify on Wessmann's behalf conceded that, ultimately, &lt;br&gt;alternative theories of causation could not fully explain the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap between white and African-American students. &lt;br&gt;Hearing this evidence, the district court rejected Thernstrom's &lt;br&gt;direct testimony and accepted only his cross-examination testimony, &lt;br&gt;along with other evidence presented by the Committee, in reaching &lt;br&gt;its conclusion that the Boston Latin admissions program &lt;br&gt;\"appropriately addressed the vestiges of discrimination that linger &lt;br&gt;in the Boston Public School system.\" 996 F. Supp. at 131. &lt;br&gt;     By asserting that the district court erred in crediting the &lt;br&gt;extensive observational testimony of experienced, well-trained &lt;br&gt;school administrators, and by requiring quantifiable data to &lt;br&gt;establish a causal link between past discrimination and present &lt;br&gt;outcomes, the majority would reduce strict scrutiny to a standard &lt;br&gt;that is indeed \"fatal in fact.\" See Adarand, 515 U.S. 200, 237 &lt;br&gt;(1995).  In my view, the district court properly concluded that the &lt;br&gt;School Committee had a strong basis in evidence for adoption of the &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin admissions program, thereby meeting its evidentiary &lt;br&gt;burden, and that the plaintiff failed to carry her burden of &lt;br&gt;persuading the court that this affirmative action program was &lt;br&gt;unconstitutional. &lt;br&gt;                              IV. &lt;br&gt;Narrow Tailoring &lt;br&gt;     To survive strict scrutiny, the School Committee's admissions &lt;br&gt;program must serve a compelling interest in remedying past &lt;br&gt;discrimination and must also be narrowly tailored to serve that &lt;br&gt;goal. \"When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling &lt;br&gt;interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it &lt;br&gt;satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in &lt;br&gt;previous cases.\" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237. United States v. &lt;br&gt;Paradise, 480 U.S. 149 (1987), is the leading Supreme Court case on &lt;br&gt;the meaning of narrow tailoring. It emphasizes the following &lt;br&gt;factors: \"the necessity for the relief and the efficacy of &lt;br&gt;alternative remedies; the flexibility and duration of the relief, &lt;br&gt;including the availability of waiver provisions; the relationship &lt;br&gt;of the numerical goals to the relevant labor market; and the impact &lt;br&gt;of the relief on the rights of third parties.\" Id. at 171.  &lt;br&gt;Fundamentally, narrow tailoring analysis asks whether a program is &lt;br&gt;\"overinclusive\" or \"underinclusive\" to serve the purposes of the &lt;br&gt;specific compelling interest on which the program is based.  Seegenerally id. at 190 n.1 (Stevens, J., concurring); Church of the &lt;br&gt;Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 &lt;br&gt;(1993). &lt;br&gt;      The following language from Croson offers some insight into &lt;br&gt;the rationale underlying these factors: &lt;br&gt;     [The narrow tailoring prong of strict scrutiny analysis] &lt;br&gt;     ensures that the means chosen \"fit\" [the] compelling goal &lt;br&gt;     so closely that there is little or no possibility that &lt;br&gt;     the motive for the [racial] classification was &lt;br&gt;     illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          Classifications based on race carry a danger of &lt;br&gt;     stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for &lt;br&gt;     remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of &lt;br&gt;     racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial &lt;br&gt;     hostility. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Croson, 488 U.S. at 493. On this account, the \"narrow tailoring\" &lt;br&gt;and \"compelling interest\" requirements serve the same purpose: &lt;br&gt;ensuring that the program in question is not simply motivated by a &lt;br&gt;desire to favor one race. \"Narrow tailoring\" serves the additional &lt;br&gt;purpose of minimizing inadvertent harms that may result from an &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program, on the basis of a \"cost-benefit\" &lt;br&gt;analysis. Given these narrow tailoring considerations, I am &lt;br&gt;satisfied that the School Committee has produced a race-conscious &lt;br&gt;admissions program for Boston Latin which is narrowly tailored to &lt;br&gt;address a compelling remedial goal. &lt;br&gt;1. Flexibility and Duration of the Relief &lt;br&gt;     The admissions program's racial/ethnic composition standards &lt;br&gt;automatically vary each year with the composition of the Qualified &lt;br&gt;Applicant Pool. The record indicates that there has been some case- &lt;br&gt;by-case flexibility in the past: a well-qualified Native American &lt;br&gt;admittee who would not have been admitted under a mechanical &lt;br&gt;application of the program's guidelines (there was too low a &lt;br&gt;percentage of Native Americans in the qualified pool that year to &lt;br&gt;have a spot allocated to that racial/ethnic group) was nonetheless &lt;br&gt;admitted after a glance at the straight composite-score ranking &lt;br&gt;indicated this student had placed above the lowest-ranked admittee. &lt;br&gt;     The limited duration requirement has generally been met by &lt;br&gt;\"built-in mechanisms\" to shrink the scope and limit the duration of &lt;br&gt;remedial programs. See Boston Police, 147 F.3d at 23, 24-25 &lt;br&gt;(quoting Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1278 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1992)). A race-conscious program's \"temporary\" nature ensures that &lt;br&gt;it \"will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is &lt;br&gt;designed to eliminate.\" Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 513 &lt;br&gt;(1980) (Powell, J., concurring). The policy at issue here is &lt;br&gt;explicitly subject to review. The superintendent must present &lt;br&gt;findings and recommended modifications to the Committee every three &lt;br&gt;years.  The district court found that the review provision \"ensures &lt;br&gt;that the Policy will not outlive the examination schools' &lt;br&gt;compelling need for it.\" 996 F. Supp. at 132. While it is not &lt;br&gt;\"self-terminating\" in an involuntary, mechanical sense, nothing &lt;br&gt;about this race preference implies permanence in the sense of the &lt;br&gt;Supreme Court's general warning against \"remedies that are ageless &lt;br&gt;in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to &lt;br&gt;affect the future.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 276 (plurality); see alsoCroson, 488 U.S. at 498. &lt;br&gt;2. Relationship of the Numerical Goals to the Composition of the &lt;br&gt;Qualified Pool &lt;br&gt;     This element of narrow tailoring assures that the &lt;br&gt;beneficiaries of any program will be qualified, thereby minimizing &lt;br&gt;the cost of the preference to society while assuring that the &lt;br&gt;favored applicants are not unjustly enriched. Cases approving &lt;br&gt;preferences in the promotions of police officers cite the &lt;br&gt;\"relationship of the [program's] numerical goals to the relevant &lt;br&gt;labor market,\" Paradise, 480 U.S. at 171, or the fact that the &lt;br&gt;preference is directed accurately towards \"the smaller group of &lt;br&gt;individuals who possess the necessary qualifications . . . .\" &lt;br&gt;Boston Police, 147 F.3d at 21 (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at 501). &lt;br&gt;This \"qualification\" factor does not make the transition from the &lt;br&gt;employment to the educational context gracefully: education, after &lt;br&gt;all, is directed at shaping individuals in a prospective manner. &lt;br&gt;Students ranking in the lower half of the applicant pool by &lt;br&gt;composite score had succeeded at Boston Latin in the past &lt;br&gt;(Headmaster Contompassis recalled one in the sixty-fourth &lt;br&gt;percentile from the top who graduated near the top of his class). &lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, the Committee's admissions program has clearly been &lt;br&gt;structured to meet this qualification requirement. No one is &lt;br&gt;admitted, on account of the \"flexible racial/ethnic guidelines,\" &lt;br&gt;from outside the qualified applicant pool (or even from anywhere &lt;br&gt;near the median score point).  In fact, for the 1997-1998 school &lt;br&gt;year, all students admitted were within the top 10.6% (by composite &lt;br&gt;score rank) of the applicant pool. &lt;br&gt;3. Impact of the Relief on the Rights of Third Parties &lt;br&gt;     In Paradise, the Court asked if the promotion preference given &lt;br&gt;in that case was an \"absolute bar\" to advancement. See Paradise, &lt;br&gt;480 U.S. at 171, 182-83 (quoting Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers v. &lt;br&gt;EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 481 (1986)). Without minimizing the &lt;br&gt;disappointment Sarah Wessmann feels at her exclusion from Boston &lt;br&gt;Latin, the answer to the analogous inquiry in this case is clearly &lt;br&gt;\"no.\" Forty-five spots were open to Wessmann on the basis of &lt;br&gt;composite score alone, and several times as many were available &lt;br&gt;when Wessmann attempted to enter at the seventh grade level (even &lt;br&gt;accounting for the 35% set-aside which existed during that year).  &lt;br&gt;     The numerous employment promotion-preference cases also ask &lt;br&gt;whether the preference imposes a layoff-like burden, i.e., whether &lt;br&gt;it defeats legitimate entrenched expectations of the disfavored. &lt;br&gt;Layoffs raise more severe narrow tailoring concerns than a hiring &lt;br&gt;preference: &lt;br&gt;     In cases involving valid hiring goals, the burden to be &lt;br&gt;     borne by innocent individuals is diffused to a &lt;br&gt;     considerable extent among society generally.  Though &lt;br&gt;     hiring goals may burden some innocent individuals, they &lt;br&gt;     simply do not impose the same kind of injury that layoffs &lt;br&gt;     impose.  Denial of a future employment opportunity is not &lt;br&gt;     as intrusive as loss of an existing job. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 467 U.S. at 282-83. Rather than being removed from a &lt;br&gt;superior school because of a racial preference, Wessmann was denied &lt;br&gt;the opportunity to move from a good school to a better school. &lt;br&gt;There is no constitutional right to attend a school of one's &lt;br&gt;choice. See Johnson v. Bd. of Educ., 604 F.2d 504, 515 (7th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1979); United States v. Perry Cty. Bd. of Educ., 567 F.2d 277, 279 &lt;br&gt;(5th Cir. 1978). It is true that Wessmann, unlike the non-promoted &lt;br&gt;police officers in Stuart or Boston Police, will not have another &lt;br&gt;chance to enter Boston Latin. However, her situation resembles &lt;br&gt;denial of a promotion with retention of current job status: she &lt;br&gt;remains at the Latin Academy which, while not the equal of the &lt;br&gt;Latin School in terms of overall student performance, is &lt;br&gt;nonetheless \"challenging\" Wessmann, according to the affidavit of &lt;br&gt;her Headmaster, the trial testimony of her father, and other &lt;br&gt;evidence in the record. &lt;br&gt;4. Necessity of Relief to Achieve the Compelling Interest, and the &lt;br&gt;Efficacy of Alternative Remedies. &lt;br&gt;(a) Necessity of relief to achieve the compelling interest &lt;br&gt;     \"To evaluate [a determination of necessity] we must examine &lt;br&gt;the purposes [a preference program] was intended to serve.\" &lt;br&gt;Paradise, 480 U.S. at 171. Here, that goal is to overcome &lt;br&gt;expeditiously the effects of past discrimination in the Boston &lt;br&gt;schools. Urgency of relief is a legitimate consideration in finding &lt;br&gt;necessity. See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 173-77.  If admissions had &lt;br&gt;been based on straight rank order for the 1997-1998 school year, &lt;br&gt;the percentage of those invited to the seventh grade who were &lt;br&gt;African-American would have dropped from 13% to 6%; for Hispanics &lt;br&gt;the drop would have been from 5% to 3%. For the ninth grade, the &lt;br&gt;dropoff would have been 21% to 14% for African-Americans and 10% to &lt;br&gt;7% for Hispanics. Given the low levels of African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students who would have been admitted to Boston Latin on &lt;br&gt;a straight-from-the-top admissions methodology (in comparison to &lt;br&gt;either the general population, the composition of the entire public &lt;br&gt;school system, or of the qualified applicant pool), a preferential &lt;br&gt;program was required to remedy the lingering effects of de jure &lt;br&gt;segregation in the system. &lt;br&gt;     Given that one of the standards for evaluating narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring is over- or under-inclusiveness to the purpose, one might &lt;br&gt;ask whether this program is \"underinclusive\" to address the &lt;br&gt;remedial needs facing the School Committee. The ultimate impact in &lt;br&gt;numbers is small eleven of ninety invitees to the ninth grade, and &lt;br&gt;thirty-seven of 440 to the seventh, were admitted who would not &lt;br&gt;have been if straight rank order admissions had been used. Overall, &lt;br&gt;the preference affects outcome for about 9% of all admittees. The &lt;br&gt;resulting representation of African-Americans and Hispanics in the &lt;br&gt;student body of Boston Latin does not even approach proportionality &lt;br&gt;with the composition of the Boston public school system as a whole, &lt;br&gt;which is 74% African-American and Hispanic. &lt;br&gt;     Wessmann asserts that underinclusivity is evidence that the &lt;br&gt;program is only intended to address an interest in diversity. Where &lt;br&gt;affirmative action deals with selective programs like promotions or &lt;br&gt;competitive schools, however, the impact of the preference may have &lt;br&gt;to be small because of the narrow tailoring requirement that &lt;br&gt;beneficiaries be qualified. Any preference can only respond to &lt;br&gt;remedial needs in proportion to the success of minorities in &lt;br&gt;raising themselves into the qualified pool. Thus, the preference in &lt;br&gt;Stuart, for example, gave \"only limited advantage\" to minority &lt;br&gt;applicants, increasing their numbers \"gradually over time.\" 951 &lt;br&gt;F.2d at 454. Under the circumstances, there is no grounds for &lt;br&gt;holding that the program here is not narrowly tailored towards the &lt;br&gt;remedial goal because it pursues that goal deliberately. &lt;br&gt;(b) Efficacy of alternative remedies &lt;br&gt;     The Committee adopted race neutral alternatives to work &lt;br&gt;towards a race-blind policy in the future. These alternatives &lt;br&gt;include more extensive schooling (extra classes during the school &lt;br&gt;year and summer school), enhanced school programs (the advanced &lt;br&gt;work classes), and admissions test preparatory courses in the &lt;br&gt;public schools feeding into the exam system. However, Professor &lt;br&gt;Edwin Melendez, a School Committee member, described the &lt;br&gt;alternatives as \"not a panacea to deal with the issue of unequal &lt;br&gt;access overnight,\" but rather as \"definitely a long-term strategy.\" &lt;br&gt;The alternatives did not address adequately the problem of urgency. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee also considered alternative admissions &lt;br&gt;plans detailed by an outside consulting firm. Consideration of &lt;br&gt;these proposals was delegated to a special ad hoc Task Force, &lt;br&gt;composed of a broad array of concerned individuals and experts &lt;br&gt;including two members of the School Committee, Professor Charles &lt;br&gt;Ogletree of Harvard Law School, several individuals with experience &lt;br&gt;in formulating affirmative action programs, and numerous public &lt;br&gt;figures with personal connections to Boston Latin from various &lt;br&gt;ethnic communities within the city. The Task Force held eight &lt;br&gt;committee meetings and five neighborhood hearings, all open to the &lt;br&gt;public. The Task Force members discussed and evaluated the &lt;br&gt;consultant's initial proposals and then worked closely with the &lt;br&gt;consultants until a plan emerged that was satisfactory to the &lt;br&gt;remedial needs at issue here. This plan was presented by the Task &lt;br&gt;Force chairs to the School Committee, which also heard the views of &lt;br&gt;the dissenting members of the Task Force. Further public hearings &lt;br&gt;were held to consider the final Task Force report before it was &lt;br&gt;adopted by the Committee.  There is no indication in the record &lt;br&gt;that any less race conscious program was ever proposed to the &lt;br&gt;Committee (before or during this litigation) which could have &lt;br&gt;effected immediate remedial relief while simultaneously maximizing &lt;br&gt;the quality of the student body. &lt;br&gt;     Relying on Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 160-61 (4th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1994), Wessmann argues that the Committee must show that a &lt;br&gt;race-neutral policy was first tried, not just considered, and that &lt;br&gt;it failed to accomplish the goal in question. In that case, &lt;br&gt;however, Podberesky himself submitted the proposed race neutral &lt;br&gt;plan which piqued the interest of the Fourth Circuit. His plan had &lt;br&gt;obviously not been considered by the university. In this case, &lt;br&gt;several race neutral plans presented by the consulting firm to the &lt;br&gt;Committee were rejected after consideration as inadequate to the &lt;br&gt;purpose of immediate remediation. Moreover, there is no Supreme &lt;br&gt;Court authority for the proposition that implementation of a &lt;br&gt;racially-preferential plan must be preceded by a failed race- &lt;br&gt;neutral attempt to accomplish the same goals. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Majority's Narrow Tailoring Critique &lt;br&gt;     The majority cites three narrow tailoring deficiencies in the &lt;br&gt;Committee's admissions program: (1) African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;applicants from private schools were by definition not hurt by the &lt;br&gt;inadequacies of the public schools, and thus should not be allowed &lt;br&gt;to benefit from any remedial program; (2) basing admissions on the &lt;br&gt;composition of the remaining qualified applicant pool will not &lt;br&gt;necessarily benefit African-Americans and Hispanics, despite the &lt;br&gt;fact that the program is predicated on remedying past &lt;br&gt;discrimination against those groups; furthermore, the program &lt;br&gt;benefits racial groups not victimized by discrimination in the &lt;br&gt;Boston schools; and (3) the program does not directly address the &lt;br&gt;problem of lower teacher expectations.  The subtext of these &lt;br&gt;arguments is a suggestion that the program is justifiable only on &lt;br&gt;racial diversity grounds, and that it is tailored only towards a &lt;br&gt;form of racial balancing. &lt;br&gt;1. The inclusion of minority applicants from private schools &lt;br&gt;     Our Constitution has always protected the right of parents to &lt;br&gt;choose a school by moving to another district, by opting into a &lt;br&gt;suburban busing program like METCO, or by sending their children &lt;br&gt;to private school. It therefore seems incongruous to punish the &lt;br&gt;initiative of those who removed their children from an educational &lt;br&gt;environment tainted by vestiges of discrimination. Moreover, there &lt;br&gt;is no reason to assume that leaving the public school system was &lt;br&gt;not in itself a burden on these families. If there were hardships &lt;br&gt;involved for families that fled the public schools (tuition, &lt;br&gt;transportation, adjusting in general to the transition), those &lt;br&gt;hardships could be fairly linked to the past discrimination that &lt;br&gt;made the public schools an unacceptable environment for their &lt;br&gt;children in the first place. &lt;br&gt;2. Potential disfavoring of groups subject to past discrimination; &lt;br&gt;separate categorization of whites, Asians and Native Americans &lt;br&gt;     The majority notes that Hispanics, \"archetypical victims of &lt;br&gt;discrimination,\" could potentially be disfavored by the program &lt;br&gt;under a hypothetical scenario whereby their representation in the &lt;br&gt;remaining qualified applicant pool was concentrated near the top of &lt;br&gt;the composite score rankings.  That potential for Hispanics (or, &lt;br&gt;for that matter, African-Americans) to be disfavored at Boston &lt;br&gt;Latin suggests some limitations in the Committee's remedial &lt;br&gt;program. Those limitations do not discredit the program.  If the &lt;br&gt;facts in one particular year were so anomalous that the program &lt;br&gt;disfavored either African-Americans or Hispanics, the case-by-case &lt;br&gt;flexibility documented above could be invoked to remedy the &lt;br&gt;anomaly. &lt;br&gt;     The majority raises a troubling point when it questions the &lt;br&gt;School Committee's separate categorization of Asians under the &lt;br&gt;admissions program's racial/ethnic guidelines. Perhaps it would &lt;br&gt;have been preferable to group Asians together with whites and any &lt;br&gt;other identifiable groups against whom there was no asserted &lt;br&gt;history of discrimination. However, in the context of the long &lt;br&gt;history of de jure discrimination against African-Americans and &lt;br&gt;Hispanics in the Boston school system, this separate categorization &lt;br&gt;of Asians does not undermine the fundamental remedial purpose of &lt;br&gt;the admissions program. Moreover, the record suggests the &lt;br&gt;possibility of a remedial interest with regard to Asians. There is &lt;br&gt;evidence of a significant language-skills achievement gap for Asian &lt;br&gt;students in the public schools.  If there is future litigation &lt;br&gt;about this aspect of the program, more achievement gap evidence &lt;br&gt;relating to Asians might be produced. &lt;br&gt;3. Not directly addressing lower teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;     The majority opinion and the concurrence both find a narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring flaw because the School Committee's admissions program &lt;br&gt;does not directly address the problem of lower teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;for African-American and Hispanic students, identified by the &lt;br&gt;School Committee as a vestige of discrimination and a substantial &lt;br&gt;causal factor of the achievement gap. The admissions program is &lt;br&gt;designed to remedy the impact of lower teacher expectations, and &lt;br&gt;not the expectations themselves and is perfectly acceptable as &lt;br&gt;such. Although the School Committee has a responsibility to &lt;br&gt;eliminate the vestiges of discrimination from the system over time, &lt;br&gt;the Committee also has a responsibility to address the harm those &lt;br&gt;vestiges currently impose on African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students. &lt;br&gt;     If the School Committee was not simultaneously addressing the &lt;br&gt;underlying teacher expectations problem, there might be a narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring concern related to the duration of the remedial program. &lt;br&gt;The School Committee is, in fact, addressing this underlying &lt;br&gt;problem. It has been making substantial efforts towards instituting &lt;br&gt;a standardized curriculum in the primary schools. A standard &lt;br&gt;curriculum sets forth what is expected from every student, &lt;br&gt;independently of what any individual teacher might otherwise expect &lt;br&gt;from any individual student. Under the Focus on Children reform &lt;br&gt;initiative, adopted in August 1996, citywide curricular standards &lt;br&gt;are to be implemented within five years. The School Committee is &lt;br&gt;also making more direct efforts to address the problem of teacher &lt;br&gt;bias. For several years it has retained the services of the &lt;br&gt;Efficacy Institute, an educational firm which had previously &lt;br&gt;undertaken large-scale teacher reeducation in the New York City &lt;br&gt;public schools. &lt;br&gt;                               V. &lt;br&gt;Conclusion &lt;br&gt;     The majority characterizes my dissent as \"wishful thinking\" &lt;br&gt;about the meaning of Wygant, Croson and other Supreme Court &lt;br&gt;precedents in this difficult area of the law. Not surprisingly, I &lt;br&gt;disagree. I believe that I am faithful to those precedents and, &lt;br&gt;unlike the majority, apply them accurately to the evidence &lt;br&gt;presented to the district court. &lt;br&gt;     The majority goes awry because it reads Wygant's requirement &lt;br&gt;of a \"strong basis in evidence\" for an affirmative action program &lt;br&gt;and Croson's reference to a \"searching judicial inquiry\" into the &lt;br&gt;justification for an affirmative action program as demands for &lt;br&gt;evidence grounded in quantifiable social science data rather than &lt;br&gt;human judgments.  There is no such demand in Wygant, Croson or any &lt;br&gt;other Supreme Court precedent. Numbers are not the only source of &lt;br&gt;the requisite degree of certainty about low teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;for minorities and causation. In this case, the extensive &lt;br&gt;observations of experienced administrators in the Boston public &lt;br&gt;schools, supplemented by the testimony of a highly qualified expert &lt;br&gt;who recognized in the Boston public schools a phenomenon he had &lt;br&gt;studied extensively elsewhere, were as probative as the statistical &lt;br&gt;surveys and regression analyses demanded by the majority. &lt;br&gt;     The majority also goes awry because it uses Croson's reference &lt;br&gt;to a \"searching judicial inquiry\" as the basis for disregarding two &lt;br&gt;critical points made by Justice O'Connor in Wygant: &lt;br&gt;     (1) The strong basis in evidence required of a public &lt;br&gt;     entity defending an affirmative action program in court &lt;br&gt;     is provided by evidence sufficient to support a prima &lt;br&gt;     facie case of discrimination against the favored &lt;br&gt;     minority. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     (2) \"In 'reverse discrimination' suits, as in any other &lt;br&gt;     suit, it is the plaintiffs who must bear the burden of &lt;br&gt;     demonstrating that their rights have been violated.\" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We applied this evidentiary framework in Stuart, thereby signaling &lt;br&gt;to the district court its applicability in this affirmative action &lt;br&gt;case. The district court followed that teaching, and we should as &lt;br&gt;well. &lt;br&gt;     For all of the reasons stated herein, I would affirm the &lt;br&gt;judgment of the district court.&lt;/pre&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",

Wessmann, challenges the &lt;br&gt;constitutionality of BLS's admissions policy (the Policy).  The &lt;br&gt;district court rebuffed Wessmann's challenge.  See Wessmann v. &lt;br&gt;Boston Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span> (D. Mass. 1988).  On appeal, we &lt;br&gt;must decide whether the Policy, which makes race a determining &lt;br&gt;factor in the admission of a subset of each year's incoming &lt;br&gt;classes, offends the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.  &lt;br&gt;We conclude that it does. &lt;br&gt;I.  BACKGROUND &lt;br&gt;  We essay a brief historical reconnaissance to set the &lt;br&gt;present dispute in perspective. &lt;br&gt;  Over two decades ago, a federal district court adjudged &lt;br&gt;the City of Boston (through its School Committee) to have violated &lt;br&gt;the constitutional rights of African-American children by promoting &lt;br&gt;and maintaining a dual public school system.  See Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Hennigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1378130\"><a href=\"/opinion/1378130/morgan-v-hennigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 480-81 (D. Mass. 1974) (Morgan I).  &lt;br&gt;Although the court found the school system as a whole guilty of dejure segregation, no specific evidence was produced to suggest that &lt;br&gt;BLS's examination-based admissions policy discriminated against &lt;br&gt;anyone or that those responsible for running BLS intended to &lt;br&gt;segregate the races.  See id. at 467-68.  Nonetheless, BLS &lt;br&gt;exhibited some of the symptoms of segregation:  an anomalously low &lt;br&gt;number of African-American students attended the school, see id. at &lt;br&gt;466 (tabulating statistics for examination schools), and the school &lt;br&gt;had just changed its entrance testing methods pursuant to a consent &lt;br&gt;decree settling charges that the earlier methods were themselves &lt;br&gt;discriminatory, see id. at 467-68.  These factors, combined with &lt;br&gt;the City's inability to demonstrate that existing racial imbalances &lt;br&gt;were not a result of discrimination, led the court to conclude that &lt;br&gt;the City's examination schools (BLS included) were complicit in &lt;br&gt;promoting and maintaining the dual system.  See id.  The &lt;br&gt;presumption established by the Supreme Court in Keyes v. School &lt;br&gt;Dist. No. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 210 (1973), to the effect that a finding &lt;br&gt;of intentional segregation in a \"meaningful portion\" of a school &lt;br&gt;system suggests that other segregated schooling in the system is &lt;br&gt;not accidental, played a pivotal role both in the district court's &lt;br&gt;holding and in our ensuing affirmance.  See Morgan v. Kerrigan, 509 &lt;br&gt;F.2d 580, 594 (1st Cir. 1974) (affirming Morgan I, 379 F. Supp. at &lt;br&gt;467). &lt;br&gt;  The remedy adopted by the district court, among other &lt;br&gt;things, obligated BLS to ensure that at least 35% of each entering &lt;br&gt;class would be composed of African-American and Hispanic students.  &lt;br&gt;See Morgan v. Kerrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1604623\"><a href=\"/opinion/1604623/morgan-v-kerrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 258 (D. Mass. 1975).  &lt;br&gt;Relying on the Keyes presumption, we affirmed this set-aside as &lt;br&gt;part of a comprehensive plan to ameliorate pervasive and persistent &lt;br&gt;constitutional infirmities throughout the Boston public schools.  &lt;br&gt;See Morgan v. Kerrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"333181\"><a href=\"/opinion/333181/tallulah-morgan-v-john-j-kerrigan-boston-home-and-school-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 425 (1st Cir. 1976). &lt;br&gt;  The Boston school system began  gradually to mend its &lt;br&gt;ways.  By 1987, systemic progress permitted us to conclude that, &lt;br&gt;for all practical purposes, the School Committee had achieved &lt;br&gt;unitariness in the area of student assignments.  See Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Nucci, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496180\"><a href=\"/opinion/496180/tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-two/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 326 (1st Cir. 1987).  We based our conclusion &lt;br&gt;not only on the distribution of students throughout the City's &lt;br&gt;schools, but also on the good faith demonstrated by school &lt;br&gt;administrators in conforming with the demands of meaningful change.  &lt;br&gt;See id. at 319-26.  Because comparable improvement had not been &lt;br&gt;accomplished in other areas, such as faculty and staff integration &lt;br&gt;and the renovation of facilities, we instructed that federal court &lt;br&gt;supervision of elements other than student assignment continue.  &lt;br&gt;See id. at 327-32.  The district court thereupon relinquished &lt;br&gt;control over student assignments, even while retaining active &lt;br&gt;supervision over other aspects of the school system. &lt;br&gt;  After 1987, the City's three examination schools   BLS, &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin Academy, and the O'Bryant School    were no longer &lt;br&gt;under a federal court mandate to maintain a 35% set-aside.  &lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, the School Committee remained committed to the policy &lt;br&gt;until 1995, when a disappointed applicant challenged the set- &lt;br&gt;aside's constitutionality.  The district court granted injunctive &lt;br&gt;relief directing the complainant's admission to BLS.  SeeMcLaughlin v. Boston Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span>, 1018 (D. Mass. &lt;br&gt;1996).  The School Committee then discontinued the 35% set-aside. &lt;br&gt;  Concerned that the number of African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students admitted to the examination schools might drop &lt;br&gt;precipitously without a predetermined set-aside, school officials &lt;br&gt;began researching alternative admissions policies in hopes of &lt;br&gt;finding one that might prevent that result without offending the &lt;br&gt;Constitution.  The effort started in mid-1996 under the hegemony of &lt;br&gt;Thomas Payzant, superintendent of the Boston public schools.  &lt;br&gt;Payzant commissioned Bain &amp; Co. (Bain), a consulting firm, to &lt;br&gt;review an array of admissions options ranging from lotteries to &lt;br&gt;strict merit-selection plans and to report on how each option might &lt;br&gt;affect the racial and ethnic composition of the examination &lt;br&gt;schools' entering classes. &lt;br&gt;  After Payzant informed the School Committee of Bain's &lt;br&gt;preliminary findings, Robert P. Gittens, the School Committee &lt;br&gt;chairman, appointed a task force to study the matter.  The task &lt;br&gt;force held meetings, hosted public hearings, and ultimately &lt;br&gt;recommended the adoption of Bain's \"Option N50.\"  Bain's study &lt;br&gt;showed that a major difference between Option N50 and some other &lt;br&gt;possible alternatives (such as a strict merit-selection option) was &lt;br&gt;that the former would minimize the diminution of black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;student admissions expected to result from abandonment of the 35% &lt;br&gt;set-aside.  Three members dissented from this recommendation.  The &lt;br&gt;School Committee nonetheless accepted Option N50, effective for the &lt;br&gt;1997-98 school year.  Option N50 thereupon became the core of the &lt;br&gt;Policy. &lt;br&gt;  We recount the Policy's most salient features, leaving &lt;br&gt;aside complexities not relevant to the case at hand.  To gain &lt;br&gt;admission to one of Boston's three examination schools, a student &lt;br&gt;must take a standardized test.  Based on a mathematical formula &lt;br&gt;that purports to predict academic performance, school hierarchs &lt;br&gt;combine each applicant's test score with his or her grade point &lt;br&gt;average, derive a composite score, rank all applicants accordingly, &lt;br&gt;and proceed to assign individuals to the applicant pool for the &lt;br&gt;examination school(s) in which they have indicated an interest.  To  &lt;br&gt;be eligible for admission to any of the examination schools, an &lt;br&gt;applicant must be in the qualified applicant pool (QAP), a group &lt;br&gt;composed of those who rank in the top 50% of the overall applicant &lt;br&gt;pool for that particular school. &lt;br&gt;  Half of the available seats for an examination school's &lt;br&gt;entering class are allocated in strict accordance with composite &lt;br&gt;score rank order.  The other half are allocated on the basis of &lt;br&gt;\"flexible racial/ethnic guidelines\" promulgated as part of the &lt;br&gt;Policy.  To apply these guidelines, school officials first &lt;br&gt;determine the relative proportions of five different racial/ethnic &lt;br&gt;categories   white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American   &lt;br&gt;in the remaining pool of qualified applicants (RQAP), that is, the &lt;br&gt;QAP for the particular school minus those persons already admitted &lt;br&gt;on the basis of composite score rank order alone.  They then fill &lt;br&gt;the open seats in rank order, but the number of students taken from &lt;br&gt;each racial/ethnic category must match the proportion of that &lt;br&gt;category in the RQAP.  Because the racial/ethnic distribution of &lt;br&gt;the second group of successful applicants must mirror that of the &lt;br&gt;RQAP, a member of a designated racial/ethnic group may be passed &lt;br&gt;over in favor of a lower-ranking applicant from another group if &lt;br&gt;the seats allotted for the former's racial/ethnic group have been &lt;br&gt;filled. &lt;br&gt;  Sarah Wessmann encountered such a fate.  BLS had 90 &lt;br&gt;available seats for the 1997 ninth-grade entering class.  Based on &lt;br&gt;her composite score, Sarah ranked 91st (out of 705) in the QAP.  To &lt;br&gt;fill the first 45 seats, the school exhausted the top 47 persons on &lt;br&gt;the list (two aspirants declined in order to accept invitations &lt;br&gt;from another examination school).  Had composite scores alone &lt;br&gt;dictated the selection of the remainder of the ninth-grade entering &lt;br&gt;class, Sarah would have been admitted.  But the racial/ethnic &lt;br&gt;composition of the RQAP was 27.83% black, 40.41% white, 19.21% &lt;br&gt;Asian, 11.64% Hispanic, and 0.31% Native American.  Consequently, &lt;br&gt;the Policy required school officials to allocate the final 45 seats &lt;br&gt;to 13 blacks, 18 whites, 9 Asians, and 5 Hispanics.  As a result, &lt;br&gt;black and Hispanic students whose composite score rankings ranged &lt;br&gt;from 95th to 150th displaced Sarah and ten other white students who &lt;br&gt;had higher composite scores and ranks. &lt;br&gt;  Acting to Sarah's behoof, her father sued a coterie of &lt;br&gt;defendants (collectively, the School Committee), alleging that the  &lt;br&gt;the Policy had defeated her candidacy and challenging its &lt;br&gt;constitutionality.  Following a 13-day bench trial, the district &lt;br&gt;court held that the School Committee's interests in promoting a &lt;br&gt;diverse student body and remedying vestiges of past discrimination &lt;br&gt;were compelling, and that the means crafted by the School Committee &lt;br&gt;to further these interests were not so expansive as to raise &lt;br&gt;constitutional concerns.  See Wessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 127-32.  &lt;br&gt;This appeal ensued. &lt;br&gt;II.  ANALYSIS &lt;br&gt;  We divide our analysis into four segments, beginning with &lt;br&gt;the standards that govern our review, then addressing the general &lt;br&gt;idea of \"compelling governmental interests,\" and, finally, &lt;br&gt;proceeding to consider seriatim the two justifications asserted by &lt;br&gt;the School Committee in defense of the Policy. &lt;br&gt;                     A.  Standards of Review. &lt;br&gt;  The Supreme Court consistently employs sweeping language &lt;br&gt;to identify the species of racial classifications that require &lt;br&gt;strict scrutiny, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U.S. &lt;br&gt;200, 224 (1995) (plurality op.) (concluding upon a review of the &lt;br&gt;Court's precedents that government must \"justify any racial &lt;br&gt;classification subjecting [a] person to unequal treatment under the &lt;br&gt;strictest judicial scrutiny\"); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 267, 273 (1986) (plurality op.) (remarking that racial &lt;br&gt;distinctions of \"any sort\" invite \"the most exacting judicial &lt;br&gt;examination\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), and &lt;br&gt;the Policy fits comfortably within this rubric.  We conclude, &lt;br&gt;therefore, that strict scrutiny is the proper standard for &lt;br&gt;evaluating the Policy.  Hence, the Policy must be both justified by &lt;br&gt;a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to serve &lt;br&gt;that interest in order to stand. &lt;br&gt;  The School Committee's rejoinder   that the Policy is not &lt;br&gt;a quota   is a non sequitur.  We agree that the Policy does not &lt;br&gt;constitute a quota   at least not in the literal sense of an &lt;br&gt;unchanging set-aside   but that fact gains the School Committee &lt;br&gt;little ground.  At a certain point in its application process   &lt;br&gt;specifically, during the selection of the second half of each &lt;br&gt;incoming class   the Policy relies on race and ethnicity, and &lt;br&gt;nothing else, to select a subset of entrants.  Thus, whether the &lt;br&gt;Policy is truly a quota or whether it is best described otherwise &lt;br&gt;is entirely irrelevant for the purpose of equal protection &lt;br&gt;analysis.  Attractive labeling cannot alter the fact that any &lt;br&gt;program which induces schools to grant preferences based on race &lt;br&gt;and ethnicity is constitutionally suspect.  See Regents of Univ. of &lt;br&gt;Cal. v. Bakke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 289 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) &lt;br&gt;(noting that regardless of whether the limitation at issue is &lt;br&gt;described as \"a quota or a goal,\" it is \"a line drawn on the basis &lt;br&gt;of race and ethnic status\"); cf. Lutheran Church-Mo. Synod v. FCC, &lt;br&gt;141 F.3d 344, 354 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (articulating similar sentiments &lt;br&gt;anent employment preferences). &lt;br&gt;  The School Committee also asserts an entitlement to more &lt;br&gt;lenient review because the Policy neither benefits nor burdens any &lt;br&gt;particular group.  Under the flexible guidelines, the argument &lt;br&gt;goes, the racial/ethnic distribution of the entering classes will &lt;br&gt;change yearly, and thus, there is no real preference for any single &lt;br&gt;group. &lt;br&gt;  This assertion leads nowhere, for the manner in which the &lt;br&gt;Policy functions is fundamentally at odds with the equal protection &lt;br&gt;guarantee that citizens will be treated \"as individuals, not as &lt;br&gt;simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national &lt;br&gt;class.\"  Miller v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 911 (1995) (citations and &lt;br&gt;internal quotation marks omitted).  Even though we may not know &lt;br&gt;before the fact which individuals from which racial/ethnic groups &lt;br&gt;will be affected, we do know that someone from some group will be &lt;br&gt;benefitted and a different someone from a different group will be &lt;br&gt;burdened.  Because a court's obligation to review race-conscious &lt;br&gt;programs and policies cannot be made to depend \"on the race of &lt;br&gt;those burdened or benefitted by a particular classification,\" City &lt;br&gt;of Richmond v. J.A.

(citations omitted), no more is exigible to bring strict &lt;br&gt;scrutiny into play. &lt;br&gt;     A remaining issue under this heading concerns our review &lt;br&gt;of the district court's findings and conclusions.  We accord &lt;br&gt;deferential review to specific findings of fact emanating from a &lt;br&gt;bench trial.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  Here, however, because &lt;br&gt;the issues advanced in this appeal   specifically, whether &lt;br&gt;diversity and curing vestiges of past discrimination satisfy strict &lt;br&gt;scrutiny   raise either questions of law or questions about how the &lt;br&gt;law applies to discerned facts, our review is essentially plenary.  &lt;br&gt;See Vecios de Barrio Uno v.

Peters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720670\"><a href=\"/opinion/720670/earl-wittmer-earl-craig-cox-and-james-jeffers-v-howard-a-peters-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span>, 919 (7th Cir. 1996) (collecting cases); &lt;br&gt;see also Croson, 488 U.S. at 521 (Scalia, J., concurring) (stating &lt;br&gt;that, \"[a]t least where state or local action is at issue, only a &lt;br&gt;social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and &lt;br&gt;limb\" may justify race-conscious action). &lt;br&gt;     In considering whether other governmental interests, &lt;br&gt;beyond the need to heal the vestiges of past discrimination, may be &lt;br&gt;sufficiently compelling to justify race-based initiatives, courts &lt;br&gt;occasionally mention \"diversity\".  At first blush, it appears that &lt;br&gt;a negative consensus may be emerging on this point.  The Wittmercourt noted that the defendants \"did not rely on generalities about &lt;br&gt;racial balance or diversity\" to justify their hiring program, &lt;br&gt;suggesting that such an attempted justification would have lacked &lt;br&gt;vitality.  87 F.3d at 920.  Other courts have stated the conclusion &lt;br&gt;more explicitly.  See Lutheran Church, 141 F.3d at 354 (ruling out &lt;br&gt;diversity as a compelling governmental interest in the employment &lt;br&gt;context); Hopwood v. State of Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714814\"><a href=\"/opinion/714814/cheryl-j-hopwood-v-state-of-texas-v-thurgood-marshall-legal-society-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 948 (5th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1996) (similar, in the educational context). &lt;br&gt;     We think that any such consensus is more apparent than &lt;br&gt;real.  In the education context, Hopwood is the only appellate &lt;br&gt;court to have rejected diversity as a compelling interest, and it &lt;br&gt;did so only in the face of vigorous dissent from a substantial &lt;br&gt;minority of the active judges in the Fifth Circuit.  See Hopwood v. &lt;br&gt;State of Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718628\"><a href=\"/opinion/718628/cheryl-j-hopwood-v-state-of-texas-v-thurgood-marshall-legal-society-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span>, 721 (5th Cir. 1996) (Politz, C.J., &lt;br&gt;with whom King, Wiener, Benavides, Stewart, Parker, and Dennis, &lt;br&gt;JJ., joined, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The &lt;br&gt;question that divided the Fifth Circuit centered on the &lt;br&gt;precedential value of Justice Powell's controlling opinion in &lt;br&gt;Bakke.  The panel in Hopwood pronounced that opinion dead.  The &lt;br&gt;dissenting judges countered that the reports of Bakke's demise were &lt;br&gt;premature. &lt;br&gt;     It may be that the Hopwood panel is correct and that, &lt;br&gt;were the Court to address the question today, it would hold that &lt;br&gt;diversity is not a sufficiently compelling interest to justify a &lt;br&gt;race-based classification.  It has not done so yet, however, and we &lt;br&gt;are not prepared to make such a declaration in the absence of a &lt;br&gt;clear signal that we should.  See Agostini v. Felton, 117 S. Ct. &lt;br&gt;1997, 2017 (1997).  This seems especially prudent because the Court &lt;br&gt;and various individual Justices from time to time have written &lt;br&gt;approvingly of ethnic diversity in comparable settings, see, e.g., &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 315 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Washington v. &lt;br&gt;Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 472-73 (1982), or have &lt;br&gt;noted that the issue remains open, see Wygant, 476 U.S. at 286 &lt;br&gt;(O'Connor, J., concurring).  But see Metro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 547, 614 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\"Like the vague &lt;br&gt;assertion of societal discrimination, a claim of insufficiently &lt;br&gt;diverse broadcasting viewpoints might be used to justify equally &lt;br&gt;unconstrained racial preferences, linked to nothing other than &lt;br&gt;proportional representation of various races.\"). &lt;br&gt;     As matters turn out, we need not definitively resolve &lt;br&gt;this conundrum today.  Instead, we assume arguendo   but we do not &lt;br&gt;decide   that Bakke remains good law and that some iterations of &lt;br&gt;\"diversity\" might be sufficiently compelling, in specific &lt;br&gt;circumstances, to justify race-conscious actions.  It is against &lt;br&gt;this chiaroscuro backdrop that we address the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;asserted \"diversity\" justification for the Policy.  Thereafter, we &lt;br&gt;turn to its alternate justification:  that the Policy is an &lt;br&gt;appropriate means of remediating the vestiges of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                          C.  Diversity. &lt;br&gt;     The word \"diversity,\" like any other abstract concept, &lt;br&gt;does not admit of permanent, concrete definition.  Its meaning &lt;br&gt;depends not only on time and place, but also upon the person &lt;br&gt;uttering it.  See Towne v.

Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 339, 343-44 (1960) (admonishing that, \"[p]articularly in &lt;br&gt;dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, &lt;br&gt;which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and &lt;br&gt;exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and &lt;br&gt;qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must &lt;br&gt;not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling &lt;br&gt;facts\").  Swann was decided when dual educational systems were a &lt;br&gt;reality and efforts to dismantle them were being frustrated by &lt;br&gt;school officials who demonstrated little ardor for implementing the &lt;br&gt;mandates of desegregation.  Chary that the exigencies of the need &lt;br&gt;for change might precipitate a rush to judgment, the Justices &lt;br&gt;confirmed that federal courts must put the horse before the cart, &lt;br&gt;that is, they must diagnose some constitutional malady before &lt;br&gt;beginning to dispense remedies.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 16.  Thus, &lt;br&gt;the Swann dictum, properly construed, recognizes that a low &lt;br&gt;percentage of minority students in a particular school does not &lt;br&gt;necessarily betoken unconstitutional conduct, but may result from &lt;br&gt;innocent causes (say, the population distribution of a given &lt;br&gt;district), and warns that, unless a skewed enrollment pattern is &lt;br&gt;caused by  unconstitutional student assignment practices, federal &lt;br&gt;courts must defer to school officials' discretion and refrain from &lt;br&gt;imposing remedies. &lt;br&gt;     This well-accepted principle does not help the School &lt;br&gt;Committee.  The  Swann Court had no occasion to consider the &lt;br&gt;question, central to this appeal, of whether and to what extent the &lt;br&gt;Constitution circumscribes school officials' discretion to &lt;br&gt;formulate and implement an admissions policy that embraces a &lt;br&gt;particular brand of pluralism.  Cf. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314 (opinion &lt;br&gt;of Powell, J.) (\"Although a university must have wide discretion in &lt;br&gt;making the sensitive judgments as to who should be admitted, &lt;br&gt;constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be &lt;br&gt;disregarded.\").  In the end, then, the School Committee's reference &lt;br&gt;to Swann only begs the question:  Swann reiterated that federal &lt;br&gt;courts must grant remedies where there are constitutional &lt;br&gt;violations, and the question here is whether the School Committee &lt;br&gt;itself has violated the Constitution.  It follows that, in order to &lt;br&gt;persuade us that diversity may serve as a justification for the use &lt;br&gt;of a particular racial classification, the School Committee must do &lt;br&gt;more than ask us blindly to accept its judgment.  It must give &lt;br&gt;substance to the word. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee endeavors to meet this challenge &lt;br&gt;primarily by lauding benefits that it ascribes to diversity.  &lt;br&gt;Drawing on the testimony of various witnesses (school &lt;br&gt;administrators, experts, and alumni), the Committee asserts that, &lt;br&gt;because our society is racially and ethnically heterogeneous, &lt;br&gt;future leaders must learn to converse with and persuade those who &lt;br&gt;do not share their outlook or experience.  This imperative becomes &lt;br&gt;even more urgent because technology, now more than ever, forces &lt;br&gt;heretofore estranged nations and cultures to communicate and &lt;br&gt;cooperate.  For these reasons, the School Committee exhorts us to &lt;br&gt;find that diversity is essential to the modern learning experience. &lt;br&gt;     Stated at this level of abstraction, few would gainsay &lt;br&gt;the attractiveness of diversity.  Encounters between students of &lt;br&gt;varied backgrounds facilitate a vigorous exchange of ideas that not &lt;br&gt;only nourishes the intellect, but also furthers mutual &lt;br&gt;understanding and respect, thereby eroding prejudice and acting as &lt;br&gt;a catalyst for social harmony.  Indeed, Justice Powell's opinion in &lt;br&gt;Bakke acknowledges that these very attributes may render an &lt;br&gt;educational institution's interest in promoting diversity &lt;br&gt;compelling.  See id.     In the last analysis, however, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee's reliance on generalizations undercuts its construct.  &lt;br&gt;If one is to limit consideration to generalities, any proponent of &lt;br&gt;any notion of diversity could recite a similar litany of virtues.  &lt;br&gt;Hence, an inquiring court cannot content itself with abstractions.  &lt;br&gt;Just as Justice Powell probed whether the racial classification at &lt;br&gt;issue in Bakke in fact promoted the institution's stated goals, seeid. at 315-19, we must look beyond the School Committee's recital &lt;br&gt;of the theoretical benefits of diversity and inquire whether the &lt;br&gt;concrete workings of the Policy merit constitutional sanction.  &lt;br&gt;Only by such particularized attention can we ascertain whether the &lt;br&gt;Policy bears any necessary relation to the noble ends it espouses.  &lt;br&gt;In short, the devil is in the details. &lt;br&gt;     By its terms, the Policy focuses exclusively on racial &lt;br&gt;and ethnic diversity.  Its scope is narrowed further in that it &lt;br&gt;takes into account only five groups   blacks, whites, Hispanics, &lt;br&gt;Asians, and Native Americans   without recognizing that none is &lt;br&gt;monolithic.  No more is needed to demonstrate that the School &lt;br&gt;Committee already has run afoul of the guidance provided by the &lt;br&gt;principal authority on which it relies:  \"The diversity that &lt;br&gt;furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader &lt;br&gt;array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or &lt;br&gt;ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\"  Id. at &lt;br&gt;315.  A single-minded focus on ethnic diversity \"hinder[s] rather &lt;br&gt;than further[s] attainment of genuine diversity.\"  Id.  Nor is the &lt;br&gt;Policy saved because the student assignments that it dictates are &lt;br&gt;proportional to the composition of the RQAP.  See id. (noting that &lt;br&gt;the adoption of a \"multitrack\" program \"with a prescribed number of &lt;br&gt;seats set aside each for identifiable category of applicants\" would &lt;br&gt;not heal the admissions plan's constitutional infirmity). &lt;br&gt;     When we articulated this concern at oral argument, the &lt;br&gt;School Committee's able counsel responded that it is unnecessary &lt;br&gt;for the Policy to consider other indicia of diversity because BLS &lt;br&gt;historically has been diverse with respect to everything but race &lt;br&gt;and ethnicity.  For empirical confirmation of this assertion, the &lt;br&gt;School Committee points to Bain's handiwork.  Having analyzed &lt;br&gt;various admissions options, Bain suggested that all the options &lt;br&gt;would result in substantial gender, neighborhood, and socioeconomic &lt;br&gt;diversity, but that, unless race and ethnicity were explicitly &lt;br&gt;factored into the admissions calculus, attainment of racial and &lt;br&gt;ethnic diversity might be jeopardized.  This attempted confirmation &lt;br&gt;does not pass constitutional muster. &lt;br&gt;     If, as we are told, diversity has been attained in all &lt;br&gt;areas other than race and ethnicity, then the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;argument implodes.  Statistics compiled for the last ten years show &lt;br&gt;that under a strict merit-selection approach, black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students together would comprise between 15% and 20% of each &lt;br&gt;entering class, and minorities, in toto, would comprise a &lt;br&gt;substantially greater percentage.  Even on the assumption that the &lt;br&gt;need for racial and ethnic diversity alone might sometimes &lt;br&gt;constitute a compelling interest sufficient to warrant some type of &lt;br&gt;corrective governmental action, it is perfectly clear that the need &lt;br&gt;would have to be acute   much more acute than the relatively modest &lt;br&gt;deviations that attend the instant case.  In short, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee's flexible racial/ethnic guidelines appear to be less a &lt;br&gt;means of attaining diversity in any constitutionally relevant sense &lt;br&gt;and more a means for racial balancing.  The Policy's reliance on a &lt;br&gt;scheme of proportional representation buttresses this appearance &lt;br&gt;and indicates that the School Committee intended mainly to achieve &lt;br&gt;a racial/ethnic \"mix\" that it considered desirable.  Indeed, Bain's &lt;br&gt;Option N50 was chosen and incorporated into the Policy because it &lt;br&gt;held out the promise of increasing minority representation over the &lt;br&gt;roughly 18% that Bain anticipated would result on a strict merit- &lt;br&gt;selection basis. &lt;br&gt;     The testimony at trial amply confirms this suspicion.  &lt;br&gt;Superintendent Payzant testified that a \"fair representation of a &lt;br&gt;cross-section of students\" of the Boston public schools would &lt;br&gt;constitute a proper \"reference point\" for defining a \"diverse mix\" &lt;br&gt;of students.  The \"cross-section\" to which he referred is comprised &lt;br&gt;of the proportions of seventh- and ninth-grade black, Hispanic, &lt;br&gt;white, and Asian students enrolled in Boston's public high schools.  &lt;br&gt;Another \"reference point\" mentioned by Payzant  was the &lt;br&gt;\"proportional representation\" embodied by the Policy, which, given &lt;br&gt;his other testimony, is ultimately designed to move in the &lt;br&gt;direction of the same racial/ethnic distribution.  Other school &lt;br&gt;officials, such as Dr. Elizabeth Reilinger and Dr. Edwin Melendez, &lt;br&gt;testified to like effect, sometimes invoking the notion of &lt;br&gt;\"underrepresentation.\" &lt;br&gt;     We do not question the School Committee's good &lt;br&gt;intentions.  The record depicts a body that is struggling valiantly &lt;br&gt;to come to terms with intractable social and educational issues.  &lt;br&gt;Here, however, the potential for harmful consequences prevents us &lt;br&gt;from succumbing to good intentions.  The Policy is, at bottom, a &lt;br&gt;mechanism for racial balancing   and placing our imprimatur on &lt;br&gt;racial balancing risks setting a precedent that is both dangerous &lt;br&gt;to our democratic ideals and almost always constitutionally &lt;br&gt;forbidden.  See Freeman v. Pitts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 494 (1992); Croson, &lt;br&gt;488 U.S. at 507.  Nor does the School Committee's reliance on &lt;br&gt;alleviating underrepresentation advance its cause.  &lt;br&gt;Underrepresentation is merely racial balancing in disguise   &lt;br&gt;another way of suggesting that there may be optimal proportions for &lt;br&gt;the representation of races and ethnic groups in institutions.  SeeLutheran Church, 141 F.3d at 352. &lt;br&gt;     It cannot be said that racial balancing is either a &lt;br&gt;legitimate or necessary means of advancing the lofty principles &lt;br&gt;recited in the Policy.  The closest the School Committee comes to &lt;br&gt;linking racial balancing to these ideals is by introducing the &lt;br&gt;concept of \"racial isolation.\"  The idea is that unless there is a &lt;br&gt;certain representation of any given racial or ethnic group in a &lt;br&gt;particular institution, members of that racial or ethnic group will &lt;br&gt;find it difficult, if not impossible, to express themselves.  Thus, &lt;br&gt;the School Committee says, some minimum number of black and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students   precisely how many, we do not know   is &lt;br&gt;required to prevent racial isolation. &lt;br&gt;     Fundamental problems beset this approach.  In the first &lt;br&gt;place, the \"racial isolation\" justification is extremely suspect &lt;br&gt;because it assumes that students cannot function or express &lt;br&gt;themselves unless they are surrounded by a sufficient number of &lt;br&gt;persons of like race or ethnicity.  Insofar as the Policy promotes &lt;br&gt;groups over individuals, it is starkly at variance with Justice &lt;br&gt;Powell's understanding of the proper manner in which a diverse &lt;br&gt;student body may be gathered.  See Bakke, 458 U.S. at 318.  &lt;br&gt;Furthermore, if justified in terms of group identity, the Policy &lt;br&gt;suggests that race or ethnic background determines how individuals &lt;br&gt;think or behave   although the School Committee resists this &lt;br&gt;conclusion by arguing that the greater the number of a particular &lt;br&gt;group, the more others will realize that the group is not &lt;br&gt;monolithic.  Either way, the School Committee tells us that a &lt;br&gt;minimum number of persons of a given race (or ethnic background) is &lt;br&gt;essential to facilitate individual expression.  This very position &lt;br&gt;concedes that the Policy's racial/ethnic guidelines treat &lt;br&gt;\"individuals as the product of their race,\" a practice that the &lt;br&gt;Court consistently has denounced as impermissible stereotyping.  &lt;br&gt;Miller, 515 U.S. at 912. &lt;br&gt;     In the second place, the School Committee has failed to &lt;br&gt;give us a plausible reason why we should believe that racial &lt;br&gt;balancing of any type is necessary to promote the expression of &lt;br&gt;ideas or any of the other ideals referenced in the Policy.  We &lt;br&gt;assume for argument's sake   albeit with considerable skepticism   &lt;br&gt;that there may be circumstances under which a form of racial &lt;br&gt;balancing could be justified by concerns for attaining the goals &lt;br&gt;articulated by the Policy.  To justify something so antithetical to &lt;br&gt;our constitutional jurisprudence, however, a particularly strong &lt;br&gt;showing of necessity would be required.  The School Committee has &lt;br&gt;provided absolutely no competent evidence that the proportional &lt;br&gt;representation promoted by the Policy is in any way tied to the &lt;br&gt;vigorous exchange of ideas, let alone that, in such respects, it &lt;br&gt;differs significantly in consequence from, say, a strict merit- &lt;br&gt;selection process.  Nor has the School Committee concretely &lt;br&gt;demonstrated that the differences in the percentages of students &lt;br&gt;resulting from the Policy and other, constitutionally acceptable &lt;br&gt;alternatives are significant in any other way, such as students' &lt;br&gt;capacity and willingness to learn.  To the contrary, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee relies only on broad generalizations by a few witnesses, &lt;br&gt;which, in the absence of solid and compelling evidence, constitute &lt;br&gt;no more than rank speculation.  Given both the Constitution's &lt;br&gt;general prohibition against racial balancing and the potential &lt;br&gt;dangers of stereotyping, we cannot allow generalities emanating &lt;br&gt;from the subjective judgments of local officials to dictate whether &lt;br&gt;a particular percentage of a particular racial or ethnic group is &lt;br&gt;sufficient or insufficient for individual students to avoid &lt;br&gt;isolation and express ideas. &lt;br&gt;     This brings us full circle.  Although Justice Powell &lt;br&gt;endorsed diversity as potentially comprising a compelling interest, &lt;br&gt;he warned that a proper admissions policy would be such that if an &lt;br&gt;applicant \"loses out\" to another candidate, he will \"not have been &lt;br&gt;foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply because he &lt;br&gt;was not the right color or had the wrong surname.\"  Bakke, 458 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 318.  The Policy does precisely what Justice Powell deemed &lt;br&gt;anathematic:  at a certain point, it effectively forecloses some &lt;br&gt;candidates from all consideration for a seat at an examination &lt;br&gt;school simply because of the racial or ethnic category in which &lt;br&gt;they fall.  That happened to Sarah Wessmann.  It violated the Equal &lt;br&gt;Protection Clause.  See People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., &lt;br&gt;111 F.3d 528, 538 (7th Cir. 1997) (concluding that preventing &lt;br&gt;\"children who are not beneficiaries of past discrimination\" from &lt;br&gt;becoming cheerleaders solely because of their race is \"a barefaced &lt;br&gt;denial of equal protection\"). &lt;br&gt;     Again, let us be perfectly clear.  We are aware that two &lt;br&gt;of our sister courts of appeals have suggested that diversity may &lt;br&gt;never constitute a compelling governmental interest sufficient to &lt;br&gt;warrant race-based classifications.  See Lutheran Church, 141 F.3d &lt;br&gt;at 354; Hopwood, 78 F.3d at 948.  For purposes of resolving this &lt;br&gt;appeal, however, we need not speak definitively to that vexing &lt;br&gt;question.  Experience is \"the life of the law,\" Justice Holmes &lt;br&gt;commented, and more probably ought to be said before this chapter &lt;br&gt;of constitutional inquiry is closed.  We conclude today only that &lt;br&gt;the School Committee's Policy does not meet the Bakke standard and, &lt;br&gt;accordingly, that the concept of \"diversity\" implemented by BLS  &lt;br&gt;does not justify a race-based classification. &lt;br&gt;               D.  Vestiges of Past Discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee endeavors, in the alternative, to &lt;br&gt;uphold the Policy as a means of redressing the vestiges of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  The court below accepted this explanation.  SeeWessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 131.  We do not. &lt;br&gt;     Governmental bodies have a significant interest in &lt;br&gt;adopting programs and policies designed to eradicate the effects of &lt;br&gt;past discrimination.  See Miller, 515 U.S. at 920; Mackin v. City &lt;br&gt;of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587240\"><a href=\"/opinion/587240/lawrence-mackin-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></a></span>, 1275 (1st Cir. 1992).  Before embarking &lt;br&gt;on such projects, however, government actors must be able to muster &lt;br&gt;a \"strong basis in evidence\" showing that a current social ill in &lt;br&gt;fact has been caused by such conduct.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 500.  &lt;br&gt;In giving meaning to the phrase \"strong basis in evidence,\" we are &lt;br&gt;guided primarily by the Court's particularized analysis in Crosonand by the \"body of appellate jurisprudence [that] has developed to &lt;br&gt;provide that label with meaningful content.\"  Engineering &lt;br&gt;Contractors Ass'n of S. Fla., Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 122 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 895, 909 (11th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></span> &lt;br&gt;(1998). &lt;br&gt;     The threshold problem that we confront in this instance &lt;br&gt;is that the School Committee disclaims the necessity for such &lt;br&gt;evidence.  Its disclaimer rests on the premise that a decree issued &lt;br&gt;in the quarter-century-old desegregation litigation mandates local &lt;br&gt;authorities to remedy any racial imbalance occurring in the school &lt;br&gt;system and thereby obviates the need for an independent showing of &lt;br&gt;causation.  This premise lacks force. &lt;br&gt;     The decree in question was entered in 1994 by Judge &lt;br&gt;Garrity, pursuant to our instructions in Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d &lt;br&gt;313 (1st Cir. 1987).  The particular provision to which the School &lt;br&gt;Committee refers is entitled \"Permanent Injunction.\"  It enjoins &lt;br&gt;the School Committee \"from discriminating on the basis of race in &lt;br&gt;the operation of the public schools of the City of Boston and from &lt;br&gt;creating, promoting or maintaining racial segregation in any school &lt;br&gt;or other facility in the Boston public school system.\"  Nothing in &lt;br&gt;the plain language of this provision requires school officials to &lt;br&gt;undertake any affirmative action, let alone to adopt a race-based &lt;br&gt;classification (such as is contained in the Policy).  Perhaps more &lt;br&gt;important, the cited provision is not (as the School Committee &lt;br&gt;would have it) a mandatory injunction.  Rather, it operates as a &lt;br&gt;negative injunction, forbidding the defendants from engaging in the &lt;br&gt;acts that supported the original cause of action.  As long as &lt;br&gt;school officials do not engage in discrimination against minorities &lt;br&gt;  and there is no evidence that such conduct persists at BLS   they &lt;br&gt;have not violated the injunction. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee's contention that racial imbalance, &lt;br&gt;without more, mandates action also is discordant with established &lt;br&gt;precepts of constitutional law.  Once there is a finding of &lt;br&gt;unitariness and the \"affirmative duty to desegregate has been &lt;br&gt;accomplished,\" school authorities are not expected to make \"year- &lt;br&gt;by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies\" &lt;br&gt;absent a \"showing that either the school authorities or some other &lt;br&gt;agency of the State has deliberately attempted to fix or alter &lt;br&gt;demographic patterns to affect the racial composition of the &lt;br&gt;schools.\"  Swann, 402 U.S. at 32; see also Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494 &lt;br&gt;(\"Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has been &lt;br&gt;remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance &lt;br&gt;that is caused by demographic factors.\"). &lt;br&gt;     That ends this aspect of the matter.  We concluded over &lt;br&gt;ten years ago that Boston had restored the unitariness of student &lt;br&gt;assignments, see Nucci, 831 F.2d at 319-26, and there is no &lt;br&gt;contention here that any municipal actor has attempted &lt;br&gt;intentionally to subvert the demographic composition of BLS (or any &lt;br&gt;other school, for that matter).  Under such circumstances, neither &lt;br&gt;the Constitution nor the 1994 decree impose a duty on Boston's &lt;br&gt;school officials to ensure the maintenance of certain percentages &lt;br&gt;of any racial or ethnic group in any particular school. &lt;br&gt;     Because the 1994 decree turns out to be a blind alley, &lt;br&gt;the School Committee must identify a vestige of bygone &lt;br&gt;discrimination and provide convincing evidence that ties this &lt;br&gt;vestige to the de jure segregation of the benighted past.  SeeFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494.    To meet this challenge, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee cites an \"achievement gap\" between black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students, on the one hand, and white and Asian students, on the &lt;br&gt;other, and claims that this gap's roots can be traced to the &lt;br&gt;discriminatory regime of the 1970s and before. &lt;br&gt;     The scope of what social phenomena the law considers &lt;br&gt;vestiges of past discrimination presents an open question.  The &lt;br&gt;presumptive vestiges are the well-known factors that the Supreme &lt;br&gt;Court enumerated in Green v. County Sch. Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 435 &lt;br&gt;(1968) (mentioning student assignments, faculty, staff, facilities, &lt;br&gt;transportation, and extra-curricular activities).  Since Green, &lt;br&gt;federal courts have recognized other permutations, including &lt;br&gt;\"quality of education.\"  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492.  What this means &lt;br&gt;and how it is to be measured are difficult questions.  Rather than &lt;br&gt;entering that debate, we accept arguendo the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;position that, in principle, a documented achievement gap may act &lt;br&gt;as an indicator of a diminution in the quality of education.  Even &lt;br&gt;so, whether an achievement gap is a vestige of past discrimination &lt;br&gt;depends on whether there is satisfactory evidence of a causal &lt;br&gt;connection. &lt;br&gt;     The court below short-circuited this inquiry.  Citing &lt;br&gt;Judge Garrity's 1994 order, the court reasoned that, once there has &lt;br&gt;been a past judicial finding of institutional discrimination, no &lt;br&gt;more evidence is needed to justify a policy that employs racial &lt;br&gt;classifications.  See Wessmann, 996 F. Supp. at 131 (stating that &lt;br&gt;the 1994 order is a \"manifestation\" of the reality of vestiges of &lt;br&gt;past discrimination and that it alone provides a \"compelling basis\" &lt;br&gt;for adoption of the Policy).  The lower court was wrong. &lt;br&gt;     There are times when a history of discrimination, in &lt;br&gt;itself, may supply a powerful evidentiary predicate sufficient to &lt;br&gt;justify some race-conscious action.  See, e.g., Boston Police &lt;br&gt;Superior Officers Fed'n v. City of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198025\"><a href=\"/opinion/198025/boston-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span> (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1998).  Nevertheless, such holdings do not hinge on the mere &lt;br&gt;existence of a past judicial finding, but, rather, on a variety of &lt;br&gt;considerations, including what transpired since the time of that &lt;br&gt;finding.  In Boston Police, for example, our detailed inquiry &lt;br&gt;revealed not only that discrimination had been a fact of the past, &lt;br&gt;but that it persisted in the Boston Police Department, and that &lt;br&gt;relatively little had been done to alleviate the situation at &lt;br&gt;certain levels.  See id. at 19-23.  The record showed, for &lt;br&gt;instance, that notwithstanding the existence of a consent decree, &lt;br&gt;progress toward the integration of the police force had been &lt;br&gt;\"halting\" and \"modest.\"  Id. at 23.  The statistical evidence &lt;br&gt;supporting this view pertained not to a distant past, but to &lt;br&gt;present realities.  See id. at 21, 23.  In the final analysis, it &lt;br&gt;was the combination of all this evidence, and the detailed showing &lt;br&gt;that the effects of earlier discriminatory conduct continued to the &lt;br&gt;present, that underpinned our conclusions.  Withal, we took pains &lt;br&gt;to warn against indiscriminate reliance on history alone lest it &lt;br&gt;permit the adoption of remedial measures \"ageless in their reach &lt;br&gt;into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\"  &lt;br&gt;Id. at 20-21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). &lt;br&gt;     In sum, whether past discrimination necessitates current &lt;br&gt;action is a fact-sensitive inquiry, and courts must pay careful &lt;br&gt;attention to competing explanations for current realities.  SeeFreeman, 503 U.S. at 495-96 (explaining that \"though we cannot &lt;br&gt;escape our history, neither must we overstate its consequences in &lt;br&gt;fixing legal responsibilities\").  The mere fact that an institution &lt;br&gt;once was found to have practiced discrimination is insufficient, in &lt;br&gt;and of itself, to satisfy a state actor's burden of producing the &lt;br&gt;reliable evidence required to uphold race-based action.  See id.at 496; Middleton v. City of Flint, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723952\"><a href=\"/opinion/723952/charles-middleton-w-osmund-kelly-iii-brian-sepanak-bruce-sepanak-stephen/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 409 (6th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1996). &lt;br&gt;     Beyond history, the School Committee offers statistical &lt;br&gt;and anecdotal evidence to satisfy its burden of demonstrating a &lt;br&gt;strong evidentiary basis for the inauguration of remedial policies.  &lt;br&gt;The district court found the evidence favoring race-conscious &lt;br&gt;remedies to be adequate, but  the court's entire treatment of the &lt;br&gt;subject comprises a lone paragraph composed of unrelievedly &lt;br&gt;conclusory observations.  See Wessmann, 996 F.

    The remaining evidence upon which the School Committee &lt;br&gt;and the dissent relies   most notably the testimony of BLS &lt;br&gt;Headmaster Michael Contompasis and Dr. Melendez   likewise &lt;br&gt;exemplifies the shortcomings of anecdotal evidence.  One cannot &lt;br&gt;conclude from the isolated instances that these witnesses recounted &lt;br&gt;that low teacher expectations constitute a systemic problem in the &lt;br&gt;Boston public schools or that they necessarily relate to the dejure segregation of the past. &lt;br&gt;     Similarly unpersuasive are the School Committee's broad &lt;br&gt;generalizations about socialization.  Superintendent Payzant, for &lt;br&gt;example, testified that he believed that teachers who started &lt;br&gt;working in the era of dual school systems (who comprise &lt;br&gt;approximately 28 % of current faculty) had been \"socialized and &lt;br&gt;shaped\" by the thoughts and attitudes of the prior period.  This &lt;br&gt;may be so, but he gave no empirical evidence to confirm his &lt;br&gt;conclusion.  While the idea of \"socialization\" may be &lt;br&gt;intellectually elegant, courts must insist on seeing concrete &lt;br&gt;evidence.  Without such substantiation, Payzant's testimony is no &lt;br&gt;more compelling than the conclusory statements of the Richmond city &lt;br&gt;councillor rejected as insufficient by the Supreme Court in Croson, &lt;br&gt;488 U.S. at 500-01. &lt;br&gt;     To the extent that the School Committee notes other &lt;br&gt;causal factors or indicia of discrimination, they, too, are  &lt;br&gt;insufficient either to show ongoing vestiges of system-wide &lt;br&gt;discrimination or to justify a race-conscious remedy.  For &lt;br&gt;instance, pointing to the instability of leadership at the &lt;br&gt;superintendent level, the School Committee suggests   so far as we &lt;br&gt;can gather; the argument is neither developed nor clear   that it &lt;br&gt;led to the absence of a standardized curriculum, which in turn has &lt;br&gt;contributed to the achievement gap.  If the argument is that the &lt;br&gt;superintendent's office had a revolving door and thereby caused the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap, then we see nothing that helps advance the &lt;br&gt;contention that the achievement gap is a vestige of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  If the argument is that the superintendent's &lt;br&gt;office has tacitly endorsed disparate curricula which in turn have &lt;br&gt;caused the achievement gap, then the School Committee has provided &lt;br&gt;us with absolutely no evidentiary basis to conclude that this is a &lt;br&gt;consequence of discrimination; among other things, it has failed &lt;br&gt;either to identify which curricula were discriminatory or to &lt;br&gt;explain why they were so.  It likewise has failed to identify the &lt;br&gt;schools that adopted the discriminatory curricula in order to &lt;br&gt;suggest a relationship between race and the existence of &lt;br&gt;substandard school programs.  Thus, it is impossible to tell, even &lt;br&gt;on the assumption that differing curricula caused the achievement &lt;br&gt;gap, whether this was a consequence of discriminatory conduct.  In &lt;br&gt;a nutshell, there is not a shred of evidence in the record &lt;br&gt;supporting the contention that unstable leadership and the absence &lt;br&gt;of uniform curriculum standards bore any relationship either to &lt;br&gt;discrimination in the Boston schools or to the existence of the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap. &lt;br&gt;     We add an eschatocol of sorts.  Even if the School &lt;br&gt;Committee had proven the requisite connection between the Policy &lt;br&gt;and the vestiges of past discrimination, the Policy could not &lt;br&gt;endure.  When authorized by the Constitution, race-conscious &lt;br&gt;remedies not only must respond to a compelling governmental &lt;br&gt;interest, but also must be narrowly tailored to rectify the &lt;br&gt;specific harms in question.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 &lt;br&gt;(explaining that any race-conscious means adopted to remedy past &lt;br&gt;discrimination must be so narrowly tailored that there is \"little &lt;br&gt;or no possibility that the motive for the classification was &lt;br&gt;illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype\").  Under this test, &lt;br&gt;the Policy sweeps too broadly. &lt;br&gt;     We limit our remarks in this regard to three points.  &lt;br&gt;First, since there is no discrimination at entry to BLS, we fail to &lt;br&gt;see how the adoption of an admissions policy that espouses a brand &lt;br&gt;of proportional representation is designed to ameliorate the harm &lt;br&gt;that allegedly has occurred (a system-wide achievement gap at the &lt;br&gt;primary school level).  Indeed, when Deputy Superintendent Jackson &lt;br&gt;was asked whether the flexible racial/ethnic guidelines in any way &lt;br&gt;affect low teacher expectations, she responded that it was a &lt;br&gt;\"complicated question to answer\" because, given the relatively &lt;br&gt;recent implementation of the guidelines, there had \"not even been &lt;br&gt;an opportunity to check that.\"  If a high-level school official &lt;br&gt;cannot confirm that a race-conscious remedy will alleviate the &lt;br&gt;purported major cause of a remnant of discrimination, we do not &lt;br&gt;comprehend how that means can be narrowly tailored. &lt;br&gt;     Second, the increased admission of black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students cannot be viewed as partial compensation for injustices &lt;br&gt;done at the primary school level.  This is so because the victims &lt;br&gt;of the achievement gap are public school students, and they are the &lt;br&gt;ones who ought to be the focus of the remedy.  The Policy does not &lt;br&gt;focus in this direction, for many of the black and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students admitted under it come from private or parochial schools.  &lt;br&gt;Thus, the Policy is not sufficiently particularized toward curing &lt;br&gt;the harm done to the class of actual victims.  See Podberesky v. &lt;br&gt;Kirwan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680721\"><a href=\"/opinion/680721/daniel-j-podberesky-v-william-e-kirwan-president-of-the-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 158-59 (4th Cir. 1994).  After all, there is &lt;br&gt;no reason to assume that granting a remedy to one member of a &lt;br&gt;particular race or ethnic group comprises a condign remedy for harm &lt;br&gt;done to another, especially when those who have been harmed are &lt;br&gt;easily identifiable and still within the institution that allegedly &lt;br&gt;suffers from the vestiges of past discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     Third, if palliating the effects of past discrimination &lt;br&gt;is the ostensible justification for the Policy, then the Policy, on &lt;br&gt;its face, has been crafted in puzzling ways.  Suppose that in a &lt;br&gt;particular year a group of Hispanic students does very well, such &lt;br&gt;that they cluster between ranks 45 and 90, but that the Hispanic &lt;br&gt;student population in the RQAP is sparse.  Suppose further that &lt;br&gt;whites and Asians form a significant majority of the RQAP.  There &lt;br&gt;is then a likelihood that, by reason of the Policy, a number of the &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students   archetypal victims of discrimination   will be &lt;br&gt;displaced by white and Asian students.  Nor need we resort to &lt;br&gt;hypotheticals to see such effects.  At the O'Bryant School, the &lt;br&gt;Policy's flexible racial/ethnic guidelines resulted in the &lt;br&gt;rejection from the 1997 ninth-grade entering class of two Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students in favor of a white student.  Then, too, given the School &lt;br&gt;Committee's position that Asian students have not been victims of &lt;br&gt;discrimination, we are unable to comprehend the remedial purpose of &lt;br&gt;admitting Asian students over higher-ranking white students, as &lt;br&gt;happened in the case of Sarah Wessmann.  This brings us back to the &lt;br&gt;point of our beginning:  in structure and operation, the Policy &lt;br&gt;indicates that it was not devised to assuage past harms, but that &lt;br&gt;it was simply a way of assuring racial/ethnic balance, howsoever &lt;br&gt;defined, in each examination school class.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;506 (\"The random inclusion of racial groups that, as a practical &lt;br&gt;matter, may never have suffered from discrimination in the &lt;br&gt;construction industry in Richmond suggests that perhaps the city's &lt;br&gt;purpose was not in fact to remedy past discrimination.\").  The &lt;br&gt;Constitution forbids such a focus. &lt;br&gt;III.  CONCLUSION &lt;br&gt;     We do not write on a pristine page.  The Supreme Court's &lt;br&gt;decisions in Croson and Adarand indicate quite plainly that a &lt;br&gt;majority of the Justices are highly skeptical of racial preferences &lt;br&gt;and believe that the Constitution imposes a heavy burden of &lt;br&gt;justification on their use.  Croson, in particular, leaves no doubt &lt;br&gt;that only solid evidence will justify allowing race-conscious &lt;br&gt;action; and the unsystematic personal observations of government &lt;br&gt;officials will not do, even if the conclusions they offer sound &lt;br&gt;plausible and are cloaked in the trappings of social science.    &lt;br&gt;See Hayes, 10 F.3d at 214 (noting the dangers of relying on &lt;br&gt;\"subjective evidence\" to justify race-conscious policies); see alsoWittmer, 87 F.3d at 919 (reminding us that \"common sense &lt;br&gt;undergirded the pernicious discrimination against blacks now &lt;br&gt;universally regretted\"). &lt;br&gt;     Our dissenting brother's valiant effort to read into &lt;br&gt;Croson a broad discretion for government entities purporting to &lt;br&gt;ameliorate past discrimination strikes us as wishful thinking.  The &lt;br&gt;Croson Court's own reference to the need for a \"searching judicial &lt;br&gt;inquiry,\" 488 U.S. at 493, and its rejection of Justice Marshall's &lt;br&gt;position, see id. at 494-95; id at 535-36 (Marshall, J., &lt;br&gt;dissenting), both suggest an attitude that is antipathetic to those &lt;br&gt;who yearn for discretion.  And unless and until the Justices &lt;br&gt;reconfigure their present doctrine, it is the job of judges in &lt;br&gt;courts such as this to respect the letter and spirit of the Supreme &lt;br&gt;Court's pronouncements. &lt;br&gt;     We need go no further.  While we appreciate the &lt;br&gt;difficulty of the School Committee's task and admire the values &lt;br&gt;that it seeks to nourish, noble ends cannot justify the deployment &lt;br&gt;of constitutionally impermissible means.  Since Boston Latin &lt;br&gt;School's admissions policy does not accord with the equal &lt;br&gt;protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, we strike it &lt;br&gt;down.  The judgment of the district court must therefore be &lt;br&gt;reversed. &lt;br&gt;     We are mindful that Henry Wessmann asks not only that we &lt;br&gt;declare the Policy unconstitutional   which we have done   but also &lt;br&gt;that his daughter, Sarah, be admitted to BLS forthwith.  The School &lt;br&gt;Committee, which has vigorously defended the Policy, has tacitly &lt;br&gt;conceded that, if its defense fails, Sarah should be allowed to &lt;br&gt;enroll at BLS.  The circumstances of this case are unusual, for the &lt;br&gt;school year is under way and Sarah Wessmann   who already has spent &lt;br&gt;elsewhere the first year and some months of what normally would be &lt;br&gt;a four-year matriculation at BLS   does not have the luxury of time &lt;br&gt;that a remand would entail.  We therefore direct the district court &lt;br&gt;to enter a judgment, in appropriate form, that, inter alia, &lt;br&gt;commands Sarah's admission to BLS without delay. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reversed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                     Separate Opinions Follow  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring.  Judge Selya's opinion &lt;br&gt;demonstrates that the school committee plan under attack here does &lt;br&gt;involve racial preference, whatever the complexity of the plan and &lt;br&gt;subtlety in expression.  Yet, this court concluded more than a &lt;br&gt;decade ago that purposeful discrimination had ended so far as &lt;br&gt;assignments were concerned and that the school committee was &lt;br&gt;proceeding in good faith.  See Morgan v. Nucci, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496180\"><a href=\"/opinion/496180/tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-two/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 326 &lt;br&gt;n.19 (1st Cir. 1987).  To survive, the school committee's plan must &lt;br&gt;serve a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to &lt;br&gt;achieve that interest.  Croson, 488 U.S. at 505-08; Wygant, 476 &lt;br&gt;U.S. at 274. &lt;br&gt;     The foremost interest urged by the school committee is &lt;br&gt;diversity, a ground that may or may not prove \"compelling\" to the &lt;br&gt;Supreme Court.  But even if diversity were an adequate ground, it &lt;br&gt;has not been shown that this plan is necessary to achieve it.  The &lt;br&gt;record shows that minorities will be included in BLS in substantial &lt;br&gt;numbers without the plan.  Op. at 20-21.  If some specific higher &lt;br&gt;level is needed to achieve diversity of views and backgrounds, this &lt;br&gt;has not been demonstrated in the record. &lt;br&gt;     The alternative interest urged on this record is that the &lt;br&gt;plan is necessary to remedy the residual effects of admitted past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  The remnants on which the school committee relies &lt;br&gt;are supposed teacher attitudes, specifically, a lower expectation &lt;br&gt;of achievement by minorities in the Boston public schools.  These &lt;br&gt;attitudes are said to be linked backward in time to mind-sets &lt;br&gt;developed during a regime of purposeful discrimination and forward &lt;br&gt;to explain poorer performance by minority public-school students on &lt;br&gt;the tests necessary for entry into the elite public schools.  The &lt;br&gt;remedy is the racial preference embodied in the plan. &lt;br&gt;     In theory, low expectations could be caused by past &lt;br&gt;discrimination and could have some effect on current performance.  &lt;br&gt;But here the quality of the supporting evidence is far from &lt;br&gt;overwhelming.  In this case, there is no study of Boston schools, &lt;br&gt;only one for Kansas City; and the evidence as to Boston, while &lt;br&gt;offered through experts, is largely based on general statements or &lt;br&gt;anecdote.  It is open to question whether such evidence can &lt;br&gt;withstand Croson's requirement of a \"searching judicial inquiry.\"  &lt;br&gt;Croson, 480 U.S. at 493. &lt;br&gt;     In all events, the plan fails to meet the Supreme Court's &lt;br&gt;narrow tailoring requirement.  The plan is clearly overbroad when &lt;br&gt;judged by the past-discrimination rationale; it provides &lt;br&gt;preferences to minority groups that were never discriminated &lt;br&gt;against by the Boston School authorities or affected by lowered &lt;br&gt;expectations of public school teachers (Asians and private school &lt;br&gt;African-American applicants in particular).  See Croson, 488 U.S. &lt;br&gt;at 506; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 284 n.13.  There is some reason to &lt;br&gt;think that African-American private school applicants rather than &lt;br&gt;public school students, may well be the principal beneficiary of &lt;br&gt;the preferences created by the plan. &lt;br&gt;     There is also no indication that the plan will do &lt;br&gt;anything to alter the expectations of public-school teachers, which &lt;br&gt;are claimed to be the source of the residual discrimination.  One &lt;br&gt;of the school committee's own experts, asked to say whether or how &lt;br&gt;the plan would resolve this problem, was unable to supply an &lt;br&gt;answer.  Op. at 49.  Another school committee expert, answering a &lt;br&gt;direct question from the judge as to whether the plan's racial &lt;br&gt;preference \"attacked the problem of teacher attitude,\" essentially &lt;br&gt;conceded that it did not.  Tr. 6-126 to -127.  These admissions &lt;br&gt;suggest a further misfit between plan and remedy. &lt;br&gt;     Finally, because the plan does not address the supposed &lt;br&gt;cause of the problem, teacher attitudes formed in the ancien &lt;br&gt;regime, the same arguments now urged to sustain the plan will be &lt;br&gt;available for the indefinite future.  Teachers retire slowly and &lt;br&gt;themselves teach those who succeed them.  The plan thus creates &lt;br&gt;just the kind of \"timeless\" racial preferences of concern to the &lt;br&gt;Supreme Court.  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 276; see Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;498, 505; cf. United States v. Paradise, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 178 (1987). &lt;br&gt;     None of these defects of fit is surprising because, at &lt;br&gt;bottom, the plan is not seriously suited to be a temporary measure &lt;br&gt;to remedy low teacher expectations that are the supposed remnants &lt;br&gt;of discrimination.  It is instead a thoughtful effort to assist &lt;br&gt;minorities historically disadvantaged while, at the same time,  &lt;br&gt;preserving the essentially competitive character of the schools in &lt;br&gt;question.  So viewed, there is no misfit between problem and &lt;br&gt;remedy; the only misfit is with Croson's requirements for the use &lt;br&gt;of racial preferences, requirements that only the Supreme Court can &lt;br&gt;relax. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;                    Dissenting Opinion Follows  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting. Under the Equal &lt;br&gt;Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, all racial or ethnic &lt;br&gt;classifications by government actors are highly suspect and will be &lt;br&gt;upheld only if they withstand strict judicial scrutiny. To meet the &lt;br&gt;strict scrutiny standard, a challenged racial classification must &lt;br&gt;serve a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly &lt;br&gt;tailored to achieve that goal. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. &lt;br&gt;Pea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 224-25 (1995). The Boston School Committee &lt;br&gt;argues that the Boston Latin admissions program serves two &lt;br&gt;compelling interests: promoting diversity in the public schools and &lt;br&gt;remedying the vestiges of past discrimination. The majority rejects &lt;br&gt;both arguments. Although I have reservations about the Committee's &lt;br&gt;diversity argument on the facts of this case, I have none about its &lt;br&gt;remedial argument. The district court properly found that the &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee had a strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;determining that the Boston Latin admissions program serves a &lt;br&gt;compelling government interest in remedying the effects of prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination, and that the program is narrowly tailored to &lt;br&gt;achieve that goal.  &lt;br&gt;     I will explain more fully my disagreement with the &lt;br&gt;majority by dividing my opinion into four parts: a summary of the &lt;br&gt;Boston schools desegregation litigation that is particularly &lt;br&gt;relevant to the development of the Boston Latin admissions program; &lt;br&gt;a description of the proper legal framework for analyzing the &lt;br&gt;evidence of the remedial interest; an analysis of the evidence &lt;br&gt;establishing that interest; and an analysis of the program's narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring. &lt;br&gt;                               I. &lt;br&gt;Some Relevant History &lt;br&gt;     Although the majority opinion provides an excellent &lt;br&gt;background statement placing the present dispute in perspective, I &lt;br&gt;wish to offer some additional background which more fully reveals &lt;br&gt;the antecedents of the Boston Latin admissions program in the long &lt;br&gt;history of court supervised desegregation of the Boston school &lt;br&gt;system. That court-supervised desegregation began in 1974, when the &lt;br&gt;district court found that the Boston School Committee had engaged &lt;br&gt;in \"affirmative acts [which] intentionally created or maintained &lt;br&gt;racial segregation.\"  Morgan v. Hennigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1378130\"><a href=\"/opinion/1378130/morgan-v-hennigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 427 (D. &lt;br&gt;Mass. 1974) (Morgan I). The Committee's acts included the &lt;br&gt;manipulation of facilities utilization, new school construction, &lt;br&gt;and redistricting to preserve distinctively white or minority &lt;br&gt;districts. See id. at 425-41. The district court noted that the &lt;br&gt;Committee was particularly successful in maintaining a segregated &lt;br&gt;school system through the establishment and use of \"feeder &lt;br&gt;patterns\" for students going from primary schools into the high &lt;br&gt;schools.  The primary schools were segregated in part because their &lt;br&gt;districts were geographically drawn and based on residentially- &lt;br&gt;segregated neighborhoods. As the high schools were far fewer in &lt;br&gt;number than the primary schools, and each high school drew on &lt;br&gt;several geographic primary school districts, the high schools might &lt;br&gt;naturally have been more racially balanced than the primary &lt;br&gt;schools. However, under the Committee's skewed feeder patterns, &lt;br&gt;students were assigned from white \"junior high\" schools into &lt;br&gt;predominantly white high schools beginning with the tenth grade, &lt;br&gt;and from African-American \"middle\" schools into predominantly &lt;br&gt;African-American high schools beginning with the ninth grade. Seeid. at 441-49. In the limited cases where students were allowed to &lt;br&gt;transfer voluntarily into schools with vacant seats, the Committee &lt;br&gt;manipulated the transfer program, alternately liberalizing it to &lt;br&gt;allow whites to transfer out of African-American schools, or &lt;br&gt;controlling it to keep African-Americans from transferring out of &lt;br&gt;African-American schools. See id. at 449-56. The district court &lt;br&gt;also found that the Committee took steps with regard to faculty and &lt;br&gt;staff assignment systemwide, and admission to the selective &lt;br&gt;citywide schools, in order to preserve the segregated status quo. &lt;br&gt;See id. at 456-69. &lt;br&gt;     Relying on the presumptive logic set forth in Keyes v.School District No. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span> (1973), the district court &lt;br&gt;concluded that pervasive de jure segregation throughout the Boston &lt;br&gt;public school system established a \"prima facie case of unlawful &lt;br&gt;segregative design\" in the examination schools. Morgan I, 379 F. &lt;br&gt;Supp. at 467, quoting Keyes, 413 U.S. at 208.  This presumption was &lt;br&gt;not rebutted. See Morgan I, 379 F. Supp. at 467-68. Although little &lt;br&gt;evidence was presented on the causes of the exam schools' &lt;br&gt;imbalanced racial composition, the court attributed part of the &lt;br&gt;disparity to the tying of admission to achievement (as opposed to &lt;br&gt;aptitude) test scores.  The court also noted that the \"advanced &lt;br&gt;work classes\" that prepared public school fifth and sixth graders &lt;br&gt;for the examination schools were segregated. See id. at 433, 484 &lt;br&gt;n.16. On appeal, we summarized the situation as follows: \"The &lt;br&gt;examination schools are segregated because black children fare &lt;br&gt;worse on the entrance examinations than whites. These children are &lt;br&gt;products of the segregated elementary classes which constituted &lt;br&gt;'tracks' to the examination schools and were more than 80% &lt;br&gt;white. . . . Thus, the segregation of the lower schools had &lt;br&gt;inevitable consequences for the examination . . . schools . . . .\" &lt;br&gt;Morgan v. Kerrigan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span>, 594 n.20 (1st Cir. 1974) &lt;br&gt;(affirming Morgan I). &lt;br&gt;     In the subsequent remedial phase of the desegregation &lt;br&gt;litigation, the court considered a proposal to use the SSAT, an &lt;br&gt;aptitude rather than an achievement test, as part of the admissions &lt;br&gt;process for the exam schools. This test would presumably reflect &lt;br&gt;less of the disparity in elementary education among applicants &lt;br&gt;resulting from the segregation of their schools. See  Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Kerrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1604623\"><a href=\"/opinion/1604623/morgan-v-kerrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 243-44 (D. Mass. 1975) (Morgan II). &lt;br&gt;Although the district court also noted that there had been &lt;br&gt;discussion about using \"the median score as a floor for &lt;br&gt;admissions,\" id. at 243, the district court declined to set an &lt;br&gt;\"arbitrary\" examination-score minimum for the purpose of promoting &lt;br&gt;desegregation of the examination schools, imploring the parties to &lt;br&gt;work towards solutions themselves.  Id. at 244.  The then- &lt;br&gt;Headmaster of Boston Latin School stated in an affidavit that, in &lt;br&gt;his practical experience, the median score was a good minimum &lt;br&gt;standard for selecting students able to succeed at Boston Latin.  &lt;br&gt;Id. at 243.  While the Headmaster \"concede[d] that this standard &lt;br&gt;[was] an assessment based on his experience, not on racial data or &lt;br&gt;studies that would show that students scoring below that mark would &lt;br&gt;be unable to learn and succeed within the Latin schools' program,\" &lt;br&gt;id., this standard was accepted by the parties and has survived to &lt;br&gt;this day as the conclusion that the top half of the applicant pool &lt;br&gt;is \"qualified\" to succeed at Boston Latin. &lt;br&gt;     As a remedy for its finding of discrimination by the &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee, the court ultimately mandated that \"[a]t &lt;br&gt;least 35% of each of the entering classes at Boston Latin School, &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin Academy and Boston Technical High in September 1975 &lt;br&gt;shall be composed of black and Hispanic students.\"  Id. at 258. In &lt;br&gt;addition, the court imposed the following requirements: &lt;br&gt;     The School Department shall also institute and &lt;br&gt;     conduct programs (a) to make all students in &lt;br&gt;     the system aware of the admission requirements &lt;br&gt;     and type of instruction offered at the &lt;br&gt;     examination schools, and (b) to recruit black &lt;br&gt;     and Hispanic applicants to the examination &lt;br&gt;     schools in future years. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          Any tutorial programs given to prepare &lt;br&gt;     students for entrance examinations shall be &lt;br&gt;     conducted on a desegregated basis, as shall &lt;br&gt;     advanced work classes (if they are to be &lt;br&gt;     continued). Any enrichment and remedial &lt;br&gt;     programs for students admitted to or enrolled &lt;br&gt;     in the examination schools shall be available &lt;br&gt;     and conducted on a desegregated basis. There &lt;br&gt;     shall be no tracking of students within the &lt;br&gt;     examination schools which results in racially &lt;br&gt;     segregated classes. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Id. at 258-59. In reviewing the district court ruling, we concluded &lt;br&gt;that the 35% floor was not an impermissible racial quota because &lt;br&gt;\"overall racial composition [of the system was ordered] to be used &lt;br&gt;as a starting point in designing a school desegregation plan. This &lt;br&gt;approach is specifically approved in Swann [Swann v. Charlotte- &lt;br&gt;Mecklenburg Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1971)].\" Morgan v. &lt;br&gt;Kerrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"333181\"><a href=\"/opinion/333181/tallulah-morgan-v-john-j-kerrigan-boston-home-and-school-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 423 (1st Cir. 1976) (affirming Morgan II). &lt;br&gt;     The issue of racial composition was considered especially &lt;br&gt;important in the examination schools. For most other schools in the &lt;br&gt;system, the district court set minority enrollment targets only &lt;br&gt;within a broad statistical range. The racial/ethnic composition of &lt;br&gt;any individual school was allowed a 25% deviation from the average &lt;br&gt;racial/ethnic composition of the public school system as a whole. &lt;br&gt;Such a wide margin of error was not necessary or appropriate for &lt;br&gt;citywide schools (such as the examination schools) for two &lt;br&gt;reasons. First, the practical problems of implementing more &lt;br&gt;complete desegregation in these schools were less significant than &lt;br&gt;in the non-citywide schools, where additional busing was the main &lt;br&gt;instrument for additional desegregation of neighborhood-based &lt;br&gt;schools.  Although busing posed a hardship for students who might &lt;br&gt;otherwise have attended schools near their homes, most students &lt;br&gt;attending citywide schools were already being bused to school. &lt;br&gt;Second, minority enrollment at the citywide schools had to reflect &lt;br&gt;more accurately the racial/ethnic composition of the system because &lt;br&gt;the citywide schools were viewed as valuable vehicles for voluntary &lt;br&gt;desegregation that could not have \"[s]ignificant departures\" from &lt;br&gt;the overall composition and still attract students seeking an &lt;br&gt;integrated learning environment. See 530 F.2d at 423. The target &lt;br&gt;figure for overall African-American/Hispanic levels at the exam &lt;br&gt;schools, 35%, was set slightly lower than the percentage of &lt;br&gt;African-Americans and Hispanics in the system as a whole because &lt;br&gt;there was a significant population of Asians at the exam schools &lt;br&gt;already, bringing total levels of \"black and other minority\" &lt;br&gt;enrollment closer to the 44% rough target set for other citywide &lt;br&gt;schools. See Morgan II, 401 F. Supp. at 244. &lt;br&gt;     In 1987, some twelve years after the initial court &lt;br&gt;desegregation orders, we held that court supervision of student &lt;br&gt;assignments in the Boston schools should end in light of the &lt;br&gt;Committee's good faith, the State Board's findings of compliance, &lt;br&gt;and the general notion that the maximum practicable level of &lt;br&gt;desegregation had been achieved (given the impact of factors &lt;br&gt;exoteric to School Committee control, such as white flight). Morganv. Nucci, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496180\"><a href=\"/opinion/496180/tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-tallulah-morgan-v-john-a-nucci-two/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1987) (Nucci). In deference to the &lt;br&gt;longstanding national tradition of local school autonomy, control &lt;br&gt;over the student assignment process was returned to the Boston &lt;br&gt;School Committee, with the express reservation that \"'unitariness' &lt;br&gt;... in all aspects of the Boston schools has not yet been &lt;br&gt;achieved.\"  Id. at 318. Finally, in 1994 the district court issued &lt;br&gt;a \"Final Judgment\" in the Morgan litigation, and \"permanently &lt;br&gt;enjoined\" the Committee \"from creating, promoting or maintaining &lt;br&gt;racial segregation in any school or other facility in the Boston &lt;br&gt;Public school system.\" Morgan v. Burke, Civil Action 72-911G, (D. &lt;br&gt;Mass. July 19, 1994), at 5 (Morgan IV). &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee voluntarily continued the 35% &lt;br&gt;African-American/Hispanic set-aside at the exam schools even after &lt;br&gt;this policy ceased in 1987 (with Nucci) to be a court mandate. In &lt;br&gt;1996, however, the set-aside effectively ended with McLaughlin v. &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee, when the district court issued a &lt;br&gt;preliminary injunction ordering the admission to Boston Latin of a &lt;br&gt;student who challenged the set-aside's constitutionality. 938 F. &lt;br&gt;Supp. 1001 (D. Mass. 1996). In making that ruling, the court &lt;br&gt;acknowledged that &lt;br&gt;     the set aside had its origins in a court- &lt;br&gt;     ordered desegregation plan; that it had &lt;br&gt;     already played a crucial and successful role &lt;br&gt;     in desegregating the once virtually all-white &lt;br&gt;     examination schools; that the First Circuit &lt;br&gt;     had in no way called its validity into &lt;br&gt;     question in returning to the [Boston School &lt;br&gt;     Committee]control over student assignments; &lt;br&gt;     and that the appeals court had, if anything, &lt;br&gt;     strongly hinted that in-place corrective &lt;br&gt;     measures ought to be continued. Indeed, it may &lt;br&gt;     not be too much of a stretch to say that, &lt;br&gt;     without the set aside, there would not have &lt;br&gt;     been a finding of unitariness with respect to &lt;br&gt;     student assignments at all. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Id. at 1016. The court then warned that \"abandonment of the 35% set &lt;br&gt;aside at the present time without adopting other remedial measures &lt;br&gt;would, within the next six years or sooner, convert BLS into an &lt;br&gt;overwhelmingly white and Asian-American school with a black and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic enrollment of about 15%.\" Id. at 1008.  &lt;br&gt;     Nonetheless, the district court found a likelihood of &lt;br&gt;success for the disappointed white applicant Julia McLaughlin on &lt;br&gt;the narrow tailoring aspect of her challenge to the admissions &lt;br&gt;program. The district court cited the fact that \"the set aside &lt;br&gt;still does not have a built-in termination provision.\" Id. at 1016. &lt;br&gt;It also noted that the Boston School Committee did \"not appear to &lt;br&gt;have explored the feasibility of less racially preferential plans &lt;br&gt;for keeping BLS [the Boston Latin School] accessible to 'qualified' &lt;br&gt;students of all races and ethnicities, and not just to those &lt;br&gt;students who, for a myriad of reasons, tend to excel on &lt;br&gt;standardized examinations at the tender age of 12,\" even though &lt;br&gt;\"such plans may well be available for defendants' consideration.\"  &lt;br&gt;Id. The court offered as one possible alternative to the rigid 35% &lt;br&gt;set-aside a periodically updated target for minority enrollment, &lt;br&gt;with \"percentages [tailored] to the relevant qualified applicant &lt;br&gt;populations.\"  In light of the preliminary injunction, the &lt;br&gt;Committee replaced the set aside, and the district court's &lt;br&gt;suggestion of a floating target was influential in molding the set- &lt;br&gt;aside's immediate replacement, the current admissions program. &lt;br&gt;                              II. &lt;br&gt;The Legal Framework for an Analysis of the Evidence &lt;br&gt;     In rejecting the district court's conclusion that the &lt;br&gt;School Committee's current admissions program for Boston Latin &lt;br&gt;\"appropriately addressed the vestiges of discrimination that linger &lt;br&gt;in the Boston Public School system,\" Wessmann v. Boston School &lt;br&gt;Committee, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span>, 131 (D. Mass. 1998), the majority &lt;br&gt;asserts that the School Committee failed to present satisfactory &lt;br&gt;evidence of a causal connection between the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;documented by the Committee and the prior de jure segregation of &lt;br&gt;the Boston schools. I disagree with this conclusion. In my view, &lt;br&gt;the majority judges the Committee's proof of causation &lt;br&gt;unsatisfactory because the majority misperceives the Committee's &lt;br&gt;evidentiary burden in defending its affirmative action program. &lt;br&gt;That point requires some elaboration. &lt;br&gt;     The law is clear that a public entity adopting an &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program to remedy the lingering effects of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination must have a \"strong basis in evidence\" for &lt;br&gt;concluding that the lingering effects it identifies are causally &lt;br&gt;linked to past discrimination. See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson &lt;br&gt;Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 500 (1989) (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of &lt;br&gt;Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion)).  The more &lt;br&gt;elusive question is what factual predicate constitutes a \"strong &lt;br&gt;basis in evidence\" justifying action by the public entity. From my &lt;br&gt;reading of the relevant caselaw, I conclude that this \"strong &lt;br&gt;basis\" requirement is met preliminarily if the public entity whose &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program is challenged in court demonstrates that &lt;br&gt;the entity adopted the program on the basis of evidence sufficient &lt;br&gt;to establish a prima facie case of a causal link between past &lt;br&gt;discrimination and the current outcomes addressed by the remedial &lt;br&gt;program. If this prima facie case is not effectively rebutted by a &lt;br&gt;reverse discrimination plaintiff, the public entity has met its &lt;br&gt;burden of establishing a compelling remedial interest. I now turn &lt;br&gt;to an analysis of the cases. &lt;br&gt;     There are no educational context reverse-discrimination &lt;br&gt;opinions from the Supreme Court which give us authoritative &lt;br&gt;guidance on what constitutes a strong basis in the evidence &lt;br&gt;sufficient to warrant remedial action. Contrary to the view of the &lt;br&gt;majority, I think it is appropriate to look to analogous cases from &lt;br&gt;the employment context. In that context, the Supreme Court has &lt;br&gt;required that  &lt;br&gt;     a public employer . . . must ensure that, &lt;br&gt;     before it embarks on an affirmative-action &lt;br&gt;     program, it has convincing evidence that &lt;br&gt;     remedial action is warranted. That is, it must &lt;br&gt;     have sufficient evidence to justify the &lt;br&gt;     conclusion that there has been prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;     Evidentiary support . . . becomes crucial when &lt;br&gt;     the remedial program is challenged in &lt;br&gt;     court. . . . In such a case, the trial court &lt;br&gt;     must make a factual determination that the &lt;br&gt;     employer had a strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;     its conclusion that remedial action was &lt;br&gt;     necessary. . . .  [U]nless such a &lt;br&gt;     determination is made, an appellate &lt;br&gt;     court . . . cannot determine whether the race- &lt;br&gt;     based action is justified as a remedy for &lt;br&gt;     prior discrimination. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 277-78 (1986) &lt;br&gt;(Powell, J., plurality opinion) (emphasis added). In his earlier &lt;br&gt;opinion in Bakke, Justice Powell (joined by no other Justices on &lt;br&gt;this point) had stated that a \"judicial, legislative or &lt;br&gt;administrative\" finding of prior discrimination was an absolute &lt;br&gt;precondition to establishing a remedial program. Regents of the &lt;br&gt;Univ. of California v. Bakke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 307-09 (1978).  &lt;br&gt;Concerned that this requirement of a prior finding might be read &lt;br&gt;into Justice Powell's opinion in Wygant, Justice O'Connor wrote in &lt;br&gt;her concurring opinion in Wygant that \"a contemporaneous or &lt;br&gt;antecedent finding of past discrimination by a court or other &lt;br&gt;competent body is not a constitutional prerequisite to a public &lt;br&gt;employer's voluntary agreement to an affirmative action plan.\" &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 289 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Although it may &lt;br&gt;seem excessively semantic to distinguish between the prerequisite &lt;br&gt;of a court or other competent body's contemporaneous or antecedent &lt;br&gt;finding of past discrimination to justify a voluntary affirmative &lt;br&gt;action program, and the lesser prerequisite of a public entity's &lt;br&gt;strong basis in evidence for concluding that such remedial action &lt;br&gt;is necessary, there is actually much at stake in that distinction. &lt;br&gt;As Justice O'Connor noted in her concurrence in Wygant: &lt;br&gt;     ...[P]ublic employers are trapped between the &lt;br&gt;     competing hazards of liability to minorities &lt;br&gt;     if affirmative action is not taken to remedy &lt;br&gt;     apparent employment discrimination and &lt;br&gt;     liability to nonminorities if affirmative &lt;br&gt;     action is taken. Where these employers, who &lt;br&gt;     are presumably fully aware both of their duty &lt;br&gt;     under federal law to respect the rights of all &lt;br&gt;     their employees and of their potential &lt;br&gt;     liability for failing to do so, act on the &lt;br&gt;     basis of information which gives them a &lt;br&gt;     sufficient basis for concluding that remedial &lt;br&gt;     action is necessary, a . . . requirement [that &lt;br&gt;     they have a court's actual finding of their &lt;br&gt;     own past discrimination before they act] &lt;br&gt;     should not be necessary. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 291 (O'Connor, J., concurring). This concern &lt;br&gt;for the vulnerable position of a public entity with a remedial duty &lt;br&gt;led Justice O'Connor to conclude that such an entity should not &lt;br&gt;have to wait for its own liability to minorities to be proved &lt;br&gt;conclusively in litigation before it could undertake remedial &lt;br&gt;action.  &lt;br&gt;     These concerns were again reflected in Justice O'Connor's &lt;br&gt;concurrence in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span> &lt;br&gt;(1987). In Johnson, the Court upheld a voluntary affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program instituted by a local transportation agency. The program &lt;br&gt;allowed, inter alia, the agency to consider gender as a factor in &lt;br&gt;the applicant's qualifications for employment.  In her concurrence, &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor noted that \"[w]hile employers must have a firm &lt;br&gt;basis for concluding that remedial action is necessary . . .  &lt;br&gt;Wygant . . .  [does not] place[] a burden on employers to prove &lt;br&gt;that they actually discriminated against women or minorities.\" Id.at 652 (O'Connor, J., concurring). She explained that an employer &lt;br&gt;would have a firm basis in the evidence, sufficient to justify &lt;br&gt;remedial action, \"if it can point to a statistical disparity &lt;br&gt;sufficient to support a prima facie claim under Title VII by &lt;br&gt;employee beneficiaries of the affirmative action plan of a pattern &lt;br&gt;or practice claim of discrimination.\" Id. at 649.  &lt;br&gt;     Justice O'Connor incorporated these standards from her &lt;br&gt;Wygant and Johnson concurrences into an opinion for a majority of &lt;br&gt;the Court only a few years later in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson &lt;br&gt;Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1989). In Croson, the Court invalidated a &lt;br&gt;minority subcontracting preference voluntarily instituted by the &lt;br&gt;city of Richmond because the city had not shown \"any identified &lt;br&gt;discrimination in the Richmond construction industry.\" Id. at 505. &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor stated that the city had failed to justify its &lt;br&gt;remedial goals with a \"'strong basis in evidence.'\" Id. at 500 &lt;br&gt;(citation omitted). The city had produced \"nothing approaching a &lt;br&gt;prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation by &lt;br&gt;anyone in the Richmond construction industry\" sufficient to justify &lt;br&gt;the city's use of subcontracting preferences to remedy its own role &lt;br&gt;in perpetuating that discrimination. Id. ( III-B, opinion of the &lt;br&gt;court) (emphasis added). If the city had presented evidence &lt;br&gt;supporting a prima facie claim under Title VII by the minority &lt;br&gt;subcontractors, remedial action would have been warranted. In the &lt;br&gt;absence of this evidence, the preference was an illegitimate racial &lt;br&gt;classification. &lt;br&gt;     In Stuart v. Roache, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573879\"><a href=\"/opinion/573879/57-fair-emplpraccas-bna-902-57-empl-prac-dec-p-41141-anne-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991), cert. &lt;br&gt;denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></span> (1992), we relied on Croson in discussing the &lt;br&gt;burden of proof required of a public entity to justify a voluntary &lt;br&gt;affirmative action plan giving minority police officers a &lt;br&gt;preference in promotion to sergeant. We stated that \"[a] majority &lt;br&gt;of the Supreme Court in Croson used the words 'strong basis' and &lt;br&gt;'prima facie case' in [the context of voluntary race-conscious &lt;br&gt;remedial action by a public entity.] Hence, that is the evidentiary &lt;br&gt;standard that we use.\" 951 F.2d at 450 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;500, and Wygant, 476 U.S. at 292). We noted in Stuart that the &lt;br&gt;presence of statistical disparities creating a prima facie case \"at &lt;br&gt;least casts doubt on the fairness of the promotion process and &lt;br&gt;requires further explanation\" by the reverse-discrimination &lt;br&gt;plaintiff. 951 F.2d at 451. To elaborate on this last statement, &lt;br&gt;we cited partially to this section of Justice O'Connor's &lt;br&gt;concurrence in Wygant: &lt;br&gt;     [A] public employer must have a firm basis for &lt;br&gt;     determining that affirmative action is &lt;br&gt;     warranted. . . . For example, demonstrable &lt;br&gt;     evidence of a disparity [between percentages &lt;br&gt;     of minorities on a staff and in a] relevant &lt;br&gt;     labor pool sufficient to support a prima facie &lt;br&gt;     Title VII pattern or practice claim by &lt;br&gt;     minority teachers would lend a compelling &lt;br&gt;     basis for a competent authority such as the &lt;br&gt;     School Board to conclude that . . . a &lt;br&gt;     voluntary affirmative action program is &lt;br&gt;     appropriate . . . . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          To be sure, such a conclusion is not &lt;br&gt;     unassailable.  If a voluntary affirmative &lt;br&gt;     action plan is subsequently challenged in &lt;br&gt;     court by nonminority employees, those &lt;br&gt;     employees must be given the opportunity to &lt;br&gt;     prove that the plan does not meet the &lt;br&gt;     constitutional standard this Court has &lt;br&gt;     articulated. However, as the plurality &lt;br&gt;     suggests, the institution of such a challenge &lt;br&gt;     does not automatically impose upon the public &lt;br&gt;     employer the burden of convincing the court of &lt;br&gt;     its liability for prior unlawful &lt;br&gt;     discrimination;  nor does it mean that the &lt;br&gt;     court must make an actual finding of prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination based on the employer's proof &lt;br&gt;     before the employer's affirmative action plan &lt;br&gt;     will be upheld . . . .  In \"reverse &lt;br&gt;     discrimination\" suits, as in any other suit, &lt;br&gt;     it is the plaintiffs who must bear the burden &lt;br&gt;     of demonstrating that their rights have been &lt;br&gt;     violated....[W]hen the Board introduces its &lt;br&gt;     statistical proof as evidence of its remedial &lt;br&gt;     purpose, thereby supplying the court with the &lt;br&gt;     means for determining that the Board had a &lt;br&gt;     firm basis for concluding that remedial action &lt;br&gt;     was appropriate, it is incumbent upon the &lt;br&gt;     nonminority teachers to prove their case;  &lt;br&gt;     they continue to bear the ultimate burden of &lt;br&gt;     persuading the court that the Board's evidence &lt;br&gt;     did not support an inference of prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination and thus a remedial purpose[.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 476 U.S. at 292-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring). &lt;br&gt;     Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Wygant, relied upon by &lt;br&gt;us in Stuart, provides a clear statement of the strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence required of a public entity defending an affirmative &lt;br&gt;action employment program in court: if minority beneficiaries of a &lt;br&gt;voluntary program could, in the program's absence, have met the &lt;br&gt;initial burden of production in a Title VII pattern-or-practice &lt;br&gt;suit (a \"prima facie case\") on the basis of the evidence relied &lt;br&gt;upon by the public entity, then the entity is justified in &lt;br&gt;preemptively enacting a voluntary remedial affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program. Put another way, the \"strong basis in evidence\" required &lt;br&gt;of a government entity defending an affirmative action employment &lt;br&gt;program in court is comparable to the evidentiary burden imposed on &lt;br&gt;a minority plaintiff who makes a claim of a pattern or practice of &lt;br&gt;employment discrimination under Title VII. Both must meet the &lt;br&gt;standard for a prima facie case. In the reverse discrimination &lt;br&gt;context, however, the public entity defending a challenge to its &lt;br&gt;affirmative action employment program in court does so by &lt;br&gt;presenting the evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination &lt;br&gt;that a putative Title VII minority plaintiff might have presented &lt;br&gt;in a potential lawsuit. &lt;br&gt;     I must pause in this discussion of the relevant &lt;br&gt;employment discrimination case law to make two points which are &lt;br&gt;important to an understanding of the evidentiary burden of the &lt;br&gt;School Committee. The School Committee asserts that evidence of &lt;br&gt;differential success rates for African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students applying to the examination schools from the advanced work &lt;br&gt;classes in the Boston Public Schools, as compared to their white &lt;br&gt;and Asian classmates, and evidence that African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students apply to the examination schools at half the rate &lt;br&gt;of white and Asian students, without more, constitute a \"strong &lt;br&gt;basis in evidence\" sufficient to justify a remedial affirmative &lt;br&gt;action program. In its amicus brief, the NAACP asserts that &lt;br&gt;statistical evidence of the discriminatory effects of overreliance &lt;br&gt;at the exam schools on composite score as a basis for admission, &lt;br&gt;without more, provides a strong basis in evidence sufficient to &lt;br&gt;justify a remedial affirmative action program.  Both of these &lt;br&gt;disparate impact contentions are wrong because they do not account &lt;br&gt;for the centrality of proof of discriminatory animus in justifying &lt;br&gt;a race-conscious remedial program. That centrality accounts for &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor's reference to the strong basis in evidence &lt;br&gt;provided for race-conscious remedial action by a prima facie Title &lt;br&gt;VII pattern or practice claim. Unlike Title VII disparate impact &lt;br&gt;claims, Title VII pattern or practice claims require evidence of &lt;br&gt;discriminatory animus. In addition to providing evidence of &lt;br&gt;disparate impact as part of its strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;remedial relief, the reverse discrimination defendant must link &lt;br&gt;that disparate impact to discriminatory animus, whether recent, or, &lt;br&gt;as asserted in this case by the School Committee, rooted in a more &lt;br&gt;distant history of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     In the Supreme Court employment cases I have discussed, &lt;br&gt;the reverse discrimination defendant sought to establish that its &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program was necessary to remedy harm caused by &lt;br&gt;recent discrimination. The disadvantaged plaintiff challenged the &lt;br&gt;existence of the discrimination itself, not whether that &lt;br&gt;discrimination had actually harmed minorities. In response to that &lt;br&gt;challenge to the existence of the discrimination itself, Justice &lt;br&gt;O'Connor made the point in Wygant and Johnson that the public &lt;br&gt;employer did not have the burden of convincing the court of its &lt;br&gt;liability for prior unlawful discrimination, nor did the court have &lt;br&gt;to make a finding of prior discrimination based on the employer's &lt;br&gt;proof to uphold the affirmative action program. Instead, the public &lt;br&gt;employer only had to demonstrate that it had a strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence for concluding that there was prior discrimination. Prima &lt;br&gt;facie evidence of a Title VII pattern or practice claim that could &lt;br&gt;be brought by minority plaintiffs would be such evidence. &lt;br&gt;     In the instant case, where there is a long history of &lt;br&gt;court findings of discriminatory acts by the School Committee, &lt;br&gt;there is no dispute about the public entity's responsibility for &lt;br&gt;prior discrimination.  Instead, given the time lapse between those &lt;br&gt;court findings of discrimination and the claim that this &lt;br&gt;discrimination still disadvantages minorities, the issue in dispute &lt;br&gt;here is whether the vestiges of that prior discrimination now &lt;br&gt;affect minorities.  This showing necessarily requires evidence of &lt;br&gt;the existence of vestiges of the prior discrimination and of a &lt;br&gt;present harm to minorities.  It also requires evidence of causal &lt;br&gt;connections between the past discrimination and the claimed &lt;br&gt;vestiges, and between the vestiges and the present harm.  Through &lt;br&gt;these connections, the School Committee must show that the need for &lt;br&gt;remedial action was a consequence of the effects of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  Nevertheless, Justice O'Connor's strong basis in &lt;br&gt;evidence/prima facie analysis still defines the evidentiary burden &lt;br&gt;of the School Committee in presenting its proof of the causal &lt;br&gt;relationship between prior discrimination and the present effects &lt;br&gt;on minorities. &lt;br&gt;     The district court in the McLaughlin case recognized the &lt;br&gt;applicability of Justice O'Connor's evidentiary framework: &lt;br&gt;     [W]hile the party seeking to justify an &lt;br&gt;     affirmative action measure here the defendant &lt;br&gt;     BSC [Boston School Committee] defending use of &lt;br&gt;     the 35% set aside bears the initial burden of &lt;br&gt;     producing \"a strong basis in evidence\" in &lt;br&gt;     support of the measure, the \"ultimate burden\" &lt;br&gt;     of proof rests with the party challenging it &lt;br&gt;     to prove that it is unconstitutional. [citing &lt;br&gt;     Wygant] . . . [T]he burden on the BSC is &lt;br&gt;     merely one of production: it must demonstrate &lt;br&gt;     that there is \"a strong basis in evidence for &lt;br&gt;     [its] conclusion that remedial action was &lt;br&gt;     necessary.\" [citing Concrete Works of Colo. v. &lt;br&gt;     Denver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679519\"><a href=\"/opinion/679519/concrete-works-of-colorado-inc-a-colorado-corporation-v-denver-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1513</span></a></span>, 1521-22 (10th Cir. &lt;br&gt;     1994)].  If it does so, the ultimate burden of &lt;br&gt;     proving that the evidence before the BSC did &lt;br&gt;     not reasonably support an inference of prior &lt;br&gt;     discrimination . . . rests with the plaintiff. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;McLaughlin, 938 F. Supp. at 1010. In the instant case, the Boston &lt;br&gt;School Committee had the burden of demonstrating to the court that &lt;br&gt;the evidence that impelled it to adopt the admissions program for &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin met the prima facie standard set forth by Justice &lt;br&gt;O'Connor in Wygant, Johnson and Croson and applied by us in Stuart: &lt;br&gt;that is, the Committee had to show that the evidence before it &lt;br&gt;would constitute a prima facie case of a constitutional or &lt;br&gt;statutory violation if brought by a putative minority plaintiff. If &lt;br&gt;this prima facie case was not effectively rebutted by Wessmann, who &lt;br&gt;always retains the burden of persuasion, the School Committee &lt;br&gt;prevails. &lt;br&gt;     The majority finds the School Committee's reliance on &lt;br&gt;cases addressing affirmative action plans designed to remedy &lt;br&gt;vestiges of past employment discrimination inapt. &lt;br&gt;     In this case, the \"barrier to entry\" &lt;br&gt;     comparable to those in the employment &lt;br&gt;     discrimination cases is BLS's requirement of &lt;br&gt;     an entrance examination and the resultant &lt;br&gt;     composite score and no one (least of all, the &lt;br&gt;     School Committee) claims that the examination &lt;br&gt;     or any component thereof is discriminatory in &lt;br&gt;     operation or effect, or that it would be &lt;br&gt;     discriminatory if it were used as the sole &lt;br&gt;     criterion for admission. Such a claim was &lt;br&gt;     central to our conclusion in Stuart, 951 F.2d &lt;br&gt;     at 451, and it is totally absent here. What is &lt;br&gt;     more, such a claim would make precious little &lt;br&gt;     sense in the context of the School Committee's &lt;br&gt;     argument, for standardized achievement tests &lt;br&gt;     (a component of the entrance examination) are &lt;br&gt;     the primary measure of the asserted &lt;br&gt;     achievement gap. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I disagree with this analysis. Precisely as in the employment &lt;br&gt;cases, there is an identifiable barrier to entry that could be &lt;br&gt;challenged by minority applicants in the event the race-conscious &lt;br&gt;aspects of the Boston Latin admissions program were elided. Amicus &lt;br&gt;curiae NAACP makes this claim on appeal; it tried doggedly to &lt;br&gt;intervene below; and its position explains why the School Committee &lt;br&gt;could not, in the context of litigation both current and &lt;br&gt;anticipated, freely admit that composite score ranking may have had &lt;br&gt;a discriminatory impact if used alone. Despite this constraint, &lt;br&gt;the School Committee did allude to the notion of discriminatory &lt;br&gt;impact, as already noted, and there was evidence presented at trial &lt;br&gt;that, for African-Americans and Hispanics, composite score was not &lt;br&gt;reliably correlated with future performance at BLS. The Committee &lt;br&gt;also took pains to indicate that its stipulation at trial that &lt;br&gt;Wessmann would have been admitted had a straight-rank-order system &lt;br&gt;been used was not a concession that such an admissions scheme was &lt;br&gt;acceptable. &lt;br&gt;     Although the admissions program challenged here was &lt;br&gt;\"voluntary,\" in the sense of not being impelled by the 1994 order &lt;br&gt;or any other court proceeding or consent decree, the mere act of &lt;br&gt;making a selection among students seeking admission to Boston Latin &lt;br&gt;exposed the Committee to legal action by minority students. As &lt;br&gt;Justice O'Connor characterized the analogous employment situation, &lt;br&gt;\"public employers are trapped between the competing hazards of &lt;br&gt;liability to minorities if affirmative action is not taken to &lt;br&gt;remedy apparent employment discrimination and liability to &lt;br&gt;nonminorities if affirmative action is taken.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;291 (O'Connor, J., concurring). The Wygant case dealt with racial &lt;br&gt;preferences in employment, an arena where the shadow of Title VII &lt;br&gt;suits by disappointed minority job seekers inevitably looms over a &lt;br&gt;public employer using selection criteria with the potential to &lt;br&gt;produce an unjustifiable \"disparate impact\" on minorities. The same &lt;br&gt;considerations apply in the context of a selective public secondary &lt;br&gt;school: the mere act of selection exposes the school system to &lt;br&gt;challenge from minorities based on the disparate impact of the &lt;br&gt;selection criteria used. Here, the relevant provision of federal &lt;br&gt;law is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000d &lt;br&gt;(West 1998), stating that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, &lt;br&gt;on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from &lt;br&gt;participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to &lt;br&gt;discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal &lt;br&gt;financial assistance.\" &lt;br&gt;     There was evidence produced at trial that any exclusive &lt;br&gt;focus on composite score in admissions had a disparate impact on &lt;br&gt;African-Americans and Hispanics. Although the ability of minority &lt;br&gt;plaintiffs to make colorable claims of Title VI violations would &lt;br&gt;not be sufficient to justify a race-conscious affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program (such claims would only be sufficient to force the &lt;br&gt;Committee to find some alternative to composite score rank order &lt;br&gt;admissions), the presence of the disparate impact underlying such &lt;br&gt;claims, when causally related to the history of de jure segregation &lt;br&gt;in the system, imposed on the School Committee a duty to ensure &lt;br&gt;that it did not violate the Constitution by using selection &lt;br&gt;criteria that perpetuated the effects of past governmental &lt;br&gt;discrimination. As already noted, the district court in McLaughlinwas skeptical of the legality of simply reverting to the use of &lt;br&gt;composite score ranking, stating just two years ago that &lt;br&gt;\"abandonment of the . . . set aside at the present time without &lt;br&gt;adopting other remedial measures would, within the next six years &lt;br&gt;or sooner, convert BLS into an overwhelmingly white and Asian- &lt;br&gt;American school . . . .\" 938 F. Supp. at 1008 (emphasis added).  &lt;br&gt;The Committee chose a remedial measure for admission to the Boston &lt;br&gt;Latin School in the wake of a long history of desegregation orders &lt;br&gt;and under the threat of Title VI suits by disappointed minority &lt;br&gt;applicants if no affirmative action were taken. &lt;br&gt;     Just as the courts have always encouraged consensual &lt;br&gt;resolutions to desegregation cases, Congress' intent to encourage &lt;br&gt;voluntary compliance with the requirements of Title VI (and VII, &lt;br&gt;for that matter) has always been a backdrop to the scheme of &lt;br&gt;evidentiary burdens the federal courts have placed on litigants &lt;br&gt;pursuant to that legislation. See Bakke v. Regents of the Univ. of &lt;br&gt;California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 336 (1978) (Brennan, White, Marshall, and &lt;br&gt;Blackmun, JJ., concurring in part) (Title VI); Johnson v. &lt;br&gt;Transportation Agency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span>, 630 n.8 (1987) (Title VII). &lt;br&gt;Similarly, in cases where there may be a duty to counteract the &lt;br&gt;effects of past government discrimination, the Supreme Court has &lt;br&gt;set evidentiary standards that facilitate a voluntary remedy. A &lt;br&gt;government entity need not admit conclusive guilt for past &lt;br&gt;discrimination's current effects before going forward with a &lt;br&gt;remedial plan. Instead, it must satisfy the court that the evidence &lt;br&gt;before it established a prima facie case of a causal link between &lt;br&gt;past discrimination and the current outcomes addressed by the &lt;br&gt;remedial program. If this prima facie case is not effectively &lt;br&gt;rebutted by a reverse discrimination plaintiff, who always retains &lt;br&gt;the burden of proving the illegality of the affirmative action &lt;br&gt;program, the government has met its burden of establishing a &lt;br&gt;compelling remedial interest under strict scrutiny analysis. With &lt;br&gt;this legal framework in mind, I turn to an analysis of the evidence &lt;br&gt;on the vestiges of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;                              III. &lt;br&gt;The Evidence on the Vestiges of Discrimination &lt;br&gt;     The district court found that \"[t]he overwhelming &lt;br&gt;evidence presented at trial confirmed the Boston School Committee's &lt;br&gt;basis for concluding that remedial action was necessary . . . .\" &lt;br&gt;996 F. Supp. at 131.  The majority says we should exercise plenary &lt;br&gt;review of that decision, \"taking the statistical and anecdotal &lt;br&gt;evidence in the manner suggested by the School Committee.\"  I agree &lt;br&gt;with the majority's approach.  I disagree with its conclusion. &lt;br&gt;1. The Achievement Gap &lt;br&gt;     The evidence at trial revealed large gaps between African- &lt;br&gt;Americans and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on &lt;br&gt;the other, in admissions to the exam schools, and in achievement &lt;br&gt;and allocation of resources throughout the system. The most &lt;br&gt;significant of these is the persistent, static gap in achievement &lt;br&gt;between African-American and Hispanic students and white and Asian &lt;br&gt;students. The gap is measured by achievement test scores of fifth &lt;br&gt;and sixth graders on the Metropolitan Achievement Test and the &lt;br&gt;Stanford 9.  Expert witness analysis of the test results over a &lt;br&gt;several year period showed a persistent and relatively unchanging &lt;br&gt;gap in achievement in all subject matters which correlated with &lt;br&gt;race: African-American and Hispanic students fared much worse on &lt;br&gt;the tests than whites. The tests also revealed that, in general, &lt;br&gt;Asians fared worse than whites on language skills achievement.   &lt;br&gt;     The evidence also demonstrated that African-Americans and &lt;br&gt;Hispanics from the public schools apply to the examination schools &lt;br&gt;at half the application rate of other students in the public &lt;br&gt;schools. Even within the special advanced work classes which are &lt;br&gt;designed to prepare Boston public elementary school students for &lt;br&gt;the examination schools, African-Americans and Hispanics fared &lt;br&gt;worse in the examination schools' admissions process than whites. &lt;br&gt;Finally, there was evidence that African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;applicants to Boston Latin from private elementary schools do much &lt;br&gt;better in the admissions process than their Boston public school &lt;br&gt;counterparts. The existence of these \"gaps\" was undisputed at the &lt;br&gt;trial.   &lt;br&gt;2. The Relationship of the Achievement Gap to Prior Discrimination &lt;br&gt;     The Committee presented evidence of a connection between low &lt;br&gt;teacher expectations for minority students and low minority &lt;br&gt;performance on achievement tests.  The Committee presented further &lt;br&gt;evidence that these low teacher expectations for minority students &lt;br&gt;are prevalent in the Boston school system, and that this prevalence &lt;br&gt;is a vestige of the long years of segregation in the Boston school &lt;br&gt;system.  Given these connections between student achievement, &lt;br&gt;teacher expectations for students, and the impact of years of &lt;br&gt;segregation on these teacher expectations, the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;itself is a current and lingering effect of discrimination.  I will &lt;br&gt;now summarize the evidence on these connections. &lt;br&gt;(a) The connection generally between teacher expectations and &lt;br&gt;student performance &lt;br&gt;     Both Dr. William Trent and Deputy Superintendent Janice &lt;br&gt;Jackson testified that teacher expectations affected student &lt;br&gt;performance. Dr. Trent gave extensive testimony concerning the &lt;br&gt;research he performed for the Kansas City School District in &lt;br&gt;connection with the school's efforts to determine whether it had &lt;br&gt;remedied the vestiges of prior segregation in compliance with a &lt;br&gt;court order.  In this study, Dr. Trent relied upon \"climate &lt;br&gt;surveys\" comprehensive questionnaires distributed to teachers, &lt;br&gt;students and parents to evaluate and score teacher efficacy.  He &lt;br&gt;explained that teacher efficacy measures \"the sense that teachers &lt;br&gt;perceived themselves or their colleagues as able to make a &lt;br&gt;difference in their teaching activities, their perceptions that &lt;br&gt;their schools operate with a sense of fairness, that they have a &lt;br&gt;high regard for their students and student body, [and] that they &lt;br&gt;perceive their school as open and accessible. . . .\"   A higher &lt;br&gt;efficacy score indicated that the teachers considered themselves &lt;br&gt;able to make a difference in their teaching activities and that &lt;br&gt;they held their students in high regard.  The Kansas City study &lt;br&gt;showed that there was a correlation between high teacher efficacy &lt;br&gt;scores and higher student test performance, while low teacher &lt;br&gt;efficacy scores were associated with low student test performance. &lt;br&gt;      Deputy Superintendent Jackson also testified that teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations affect student performance.  Early in Jackson's career &lt;br&gt;she was specifically trained in TEASA (Teacher Expectations and &lt;br&gt;Student's Achievement) techniques.  TEASA's techniques were derived &lt;br&gt;from studies demonstrating that interactions of teachers with &lt;br&gt;students can convey whether the teachers believe that the students &lt;br&gt;are capable of performing at a high level.  Specifically, the &lt;br&gt;techniques attempt to focus the teachers on their unconscious &lt;br&gt;biases about low and high achievers, including how their racial &lt;br&gt;attitudes influence their expectations of the students.  For many &lt;br&gt;years, Jackson instructed teachers on these techniques and &lt;br&gt;conducted countless training sessions to demonstrate how teachers' &lt;br&gt;interactions with students, even at an unconscious level, can have &lt;br&gt;a significant impact on student performance. &lt;br&gt;     Superintendent Thomas Payzant echoed Trent's and Jackson's &lt;br&gt;statements: \"My experience is that if you set high expectations for &lt;br&gt;a student, they will try harder to reach the higher bar than if you &lt;br&gt;set low expectations where they will tend to be content that they &lt;br&gt;have met what they are expected to do and should be satisfied with &lt;br&gt;their accomplishment.\" &lt;br&gt;(b) Low expectations for minority students in the Boston School &lt;br&gt;System &lt;br&gt;     Deputy Superintendent Jackson described her numerous &lt;br&gt;opportunities to observe the interactions among students, teachers &lt;br&gt;and administrators in the Boston public schools. In fact, Jackson &lt;br&gt;testified that she observed between thirty and forty Boston public &lt;br&gt;schools in her first year as Deputy Superintendent and at least &lt;br&gt;another forty schools in the system her second year.  During these &lt;br&gt;classroom visits, she observed that teachers had different &lt;br&gt;expectations for the African-American and Hispanic children versus &lt;br&gt;the Asian and white children.  She saw incidents of unjustified &lt;br&gt;disciplinary action directed at minority students, and noted a &lt;br&gt;frequent failure of teachers to call upon African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students in class. She also saw recurring instances of &lt;br&gt;teachers withholding praise for minorities and treating them with &lt;br&gt;condescending laxity when calling upon them in class.  &lt;br&gt;     Noting the substantial disparity in the application rates of &lt;br&gt;African-American and Hispanic students compared with white and &lt;br&gt;Asian students to Boston Latin School, Dr. Trent connected these &lt;br&gt;low expectations for minority students described by Jackson to the &lt;br&gt;minority students' low test performance and low admissions rate at &lt;br&gt;the examination schools. Dr. Trent explained that \"[t]o the extent &lt;br&gt;teachers play a central role in encouraging and preparing students &lt;br&gt;to apply for one of the more valued resources in the Boston Public &lt;br&gt;Schools, [the difference in application rates] reflects a very &lt;br&gt;different rate of success with encouraging or facilitating black &lt;br&gt;and Hispanic students applying, in contrast to the rate at which &lt;br&gt;white and Asian students do.\" He elaborated on this point:  &lt;br&gt;          Based, again, on the commentary reported and &lt;br&gt;     recorded by Deputy Jackson in her deposition, and my &lt;br&gt;     interviews, and on the pattern of applicant disparity, as &lt;br&gt;     well as looking at the data in terms of the generation of &lt;br&gt;     applicants, and there's chartered information that shows &lt;br&gt;     the same schools, for example, that generate substantial &lt;br&gt;     numbers of white and Asian applicants are not as &lt;br&gt;     successful with generating comparable numbers or rates of &lt;br&gt;     applicants for black and Hispanic students. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;          These suggest patterns of differential treatment or &lt;br&gt;     encouragement, or success, at least, with those black &lt;br&gt;     students, some of which is likely attributable to &lt;br&gt;     differential expectations, particularly within the &lt;br&gt;     commentary of the headmasters and the principals of the &lt;br&gt;     schools I had an opportunity to visit. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;(c) Low expectations for minority students as a vestige of prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination &lt;br&gt;      Dr. Trent provided the primary evidence on the causal link &lt;br&gt;between prior discrimination and low teacher expectations for &lt;br&gt;minority students and the effect of these low expectations on the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap. Dr. Trent tied these low expectations to the &lt;br&gt;lingering effects of a segregated school system.  He explained: \"It &lt;br&gt;appears that in the seniority ranks, as many as 28.4 percent of the &lt;br&gt;teachers currently employed in the district have been with the &lt;br&gt;district since prior to 1973, and about 47 percent have been with &lt;br&gt;the district from 1980 and prior.\"  These numbers indicated to Dr. &lt;br&gt;Trent that many of the teachers' attitudes towards their students &lt;br&gt;and expectations of them were shaped in a segregated school system. &lt;br&gt;Dr. Trent explained the difficulty of changing such teacher &lt;br&gt;attitudes following a desegregation order:  &lt;br&gt;          . . . [A]n organizational theory in research &lt;br&gt;     suggests that organizational change and organizational &lt;br&gt;     stability, particularly the climate of attitudes and &lt;br&gt;     dispositions within organizations, is a critical feature, &lt;br&gt;     and that generally recruitment hinges on socializing new &lt;br&gt;     members into the existing culture of the organization. So &lt;br&gt;     to the extent that there is this kind of faculty &lt;br&gt;     seniority and tenure in the district, we could be seeing &lt;br&gt;     the persistence of particular attitudes that predate or &lt;br&gt;     at least were shaped and developed during the period of &lt;br&gt;     intense contestations regarding the desegregation of the &lt;br&gt;     schools [in Boston]. And to the extent that there is &lt;br&gt;     little change, effort, professional development, and &lt;br&gt;     other sorts of efforts that would address those &lt;br&gt;     prevailing attitudes, you could have a persistence of &lt;br&gt;     those attitudes and the socialization of new individuals &lt;br&gt;     into those existing cultures. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;          School desegregation research has shown the &lt;br&gt;     importance of changing the composition of the makeup of &lt;br&gt;     the schools, the racial composition of faculty, and the &lt;br&gt;     importance of changing leadership, as well as providing &lt;br&gt;     professional development experiences in order to &lt;br&gt;     facilitate greater success with the desegregation effort. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Based on his interviews with school personnel, Dr. Trent testified &lt;br&gt;that there was no evidence that the school system had been &lt;br&gt;successful in counteracting the diminished expectations for &lt;br&gt;minority students. &lt;br&gt;     As noted by the majority, Dr. Trent did not conduct a specific &lt;br&gt;study of the Boston school system, as he had done for the Kansas &lt;br&gt;City School District, to evaluate whether teachers had different &lt;br&gt;expectations for minority students and whether those low &lt;br&gt;expectations were attitudinal remnants of the segregation era. In &lt;br&gt;lieu of such a study, Trent relied on the seniority statistics &lt;br&gt;discussed above as well as statistics relating to the different &lt;br&gt;student application rates to the exam schools, indicating a &lt;br&gt;substantial disparity between the application rates of African- &lt;br&gt;Americans and Hispanics compared to whites and Asians. He also &lt;br&gt;relied on statistics that show that African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students attending the Boston public schools receive invitations to &lt;br&gt;attend Boston Latin at a much lower rate than do African-Americans &lt;br&gt;and Hispanics attending private schools, whereas the invitation &lt;br&gt;rates for white and Asian private school and white and Asian public &lt;br&gt;school students were comparable. Finally, he relied on interviews &lt;br&gt;with headmasters, principals and other personnel, as well as an &lt;br&gt;interview with Deputy Superintendent Janice Jackson, who, as noted, &lt;br&gt;had special training in observing teacher interactions with &lt;br&gt;students, and had made a personal survey of over seventy schools in &lt;br&gt;the Boston school system over the course of two years.  Based on &lt;br&gt;this information, he offered his expert opinion that low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations for minorities, shaped in the segregation era, are a &lt;br&gt;cause of the current achievement gap, and thus the achievement gap &lt;br&gt;itself is a vestige of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;     Superintendent Payzant also testified to vestiges of prior  &lt;br&gt;discrimination in the school system. He first explained that, prior &lt;br&gt;to 1973, there were  &lt;br&gt;     specific practices in the school district that resulted &lt;br&gt;     in students being assigned to schools that often led to &lt;br&gt;     particular races being represented in some schools and &lt;br&gt;     not others, practices that resulted in resources being &lt;br&gt;     unequally distributed so that there were disparities &lt;br&gt;     among the schools, disparities among the programs that &lt;br&gt;     were offered and the access and opportunity that students &lt;br&gt;     had to them . . . . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          . . . . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          And I cite that because I think the institutional &lt;br&gt;     history of the school district prior to 1973 was shaped &lt;br&gt;     by those practices.  And as I testified a moment ago, &lt;br&gt;     there is a significant percentage of teachers and other &lt;br&gt;     educators in the Boston Public Schools who really were &lt;br&gt;     socialized and shaped by the expectation that the &lt;br&gt;     institution had in the pre-1973 period.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He further explained the significance of this \"socialization\" in &lt;br&gt;the pre-1973 period: \"[W]hat was going on [pre-1973] was part of &lt;br&gt;what people saw as their normal working conditions and they learned &lt;br&gt;to function in those settings and, whether consciously or &lt;br&gt;unconsciously, accepted the practices that were occurring in many &lt;br&gt;instances.\"  He noted that  &lt;br&gt;     there was a disparity in terms of allocation of &lt;br&gt;     resources, access to programs, variation in quality from &lt;br&gt;     school to school, . . . [and] the result was that some  &lt;br&gt;     students were getting a higher quality education than &lt;br&gt;     others and often that was defined by race, and that was &lt;br&gt;     part of the background with respect to expectations that &lt;br&gt;     were set for what students could or could not do. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     Robert Gittens, Vice-Chair of the Boston School Committee, &lt;br&gt;also testified that the effects of segregation and prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination permeated the school system despite its efforts to &lt;br&gt;remedy the problem. He explained that he was often in contact with &lt;br&gt;African-American parents who complained of being alienated from the &lt;br&gt;school system. They also complained that their children were not &lt;br&gt;being motivated or challenged academically.  He noted, however, &lt;br&gt;that he did not hear these complaints from white parents.  He &lt;br&gt;further stated:  \"We have schools today that are overwhelmingly &lt;br&gt;black and Hispanic[.]  I believe that there is a pervasive sense &lt;br&gt;that there are kids in the system who cannot, will not . . . &lt;br&gt;succeed.\"  He elaborated:  &lt;br&gt;     I think that one of the things that has happened is we &lt;br&gt;     have a teaching force that has been in the system for a &lt;br&gt;     very long period of time.  And I think that there are &lt;br&gt;     large numbers of teachers who, and I've heard this from &lt;br&gt;     headmasters and principals and others, that there are &lt;br&gt;     teachers who say, \"I've been teaching this way for 20 or &lt;br&gt;     25 years.  Why should I change the way I teach?\" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;3. A prima facie case of causation &lt;br&gt;     The majority's criticisms of the Committee's evidentiary case &lt;br&gt;are twofold: 1) the Committee did not establish the presence of &lt;br&gt;differential teacher exceptions for minority students and 2) the &lt;br&gt;Committee failed to establish any causal connection between prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination and the achievement gap itself; that is, it failed &lt;br&gt;to establish that prior discrimination affected low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations for minority students and further failed to establish &lt;br&gt;that these low expectations were a cause of the achievement gap. I &lt;br&gt;respond to these criticisms in turn. &lt;br&gt;     The majority asserts that Dr. Trent's failure to conduct a &lt;br&gt;survey of the type conducted in Kansas City disabled him from &lt;br&gt;validly establishing that teachers had different expectations for &lt;br&gt;minority students.  Specifically, the majority criticizes Dr. &lt;br&gt;Trent's reliance on \"anecdotal\" evidence about teacher attitudes &lt;br&gt;supplied by school officials rather than the broad survey of &lt;br&gt;teachers in Kansas City.  Used pejoratively, the word \"anecdotal\" &lt;br&gt;describes accounts of isolated instances few in number. Used &lt;br&gt;descriptively, the word describes observational testimony that &lt;br&gt;could embrace many instances of a phenomenon.  We should be wary of &lt;br&gt;dismissing as \"anecdotal\" the extensive observational accounts of &lt;br&gt;experienced school administrators testifying about the prevalence &lt;br&gt;of different teacher expectations in their school systems, &lt;br&gt;particularly when, as in the case of Deputy Superintendent Jackson, &lt;br&gt;the administrator is trained to make such observations. &lt;br&gt;     Jackson had observed a large variety of classrooms before her &lt;br&gt;work in the Boston schools. As a result, her observations of over &lt;br&gt;seventy schools in the Boston school system over a two year period &lt;br&gt;were made within a broader frame of reference than those of the &lt;br&gt;individual teachers, students, and parents responding to the &lt;br&gt;surveys relied on by Dr. Trent in his Kansas City survey. Jackson's &lt;br&gt;extensive training in making such observations would allow her to &lt;br&gt;notice nuanced behavior that survey respondents would not have &lt;br&gt;discerned.  While the risk that the personal bias of the observer &lt;br&gt;will infect the results is greater when relying on data filtered &lt;br&gt;through a few observers, as opposed to data reported on paper by a &lt;br&gt;large number of survey respondents, Jackson was trained to make her &lt;br&gt;observations in a professional, objective manner.  Observations of &lt;br&gt;wide scope, reported by parties with training in methods of &lt;br&gt;objective observation, do permit generalization about \"pervasive,\" &lt;br&gt;\"systematic\" problems. &lt;br&gt;     The majority opinion and the concurrence contend that there is &lt;br&gt;a similarity between the evidence relied upon by the School &lt;br&gt;Committee and the evidence found inadequate by the Supreme Court in &lt;br&gt;Croson. I find this analogy unconvincing.  In Croson, there was no &lt;br&gt;evidence of local, industry-specific discrimination beyond the &lt;br&gt;statements of one councilperson to the effect that he was \"familiar &lt;br&gt;with the practices in the construction industry in this area,\" and &lt;br&gt;that in his experience \"the general conduct of . . . the industry &lt;br&gt;. . . is one in which race discrimination and exclusion on the &lt;br&gt;basis of race is widespread.\" Id. at 480. Such a vague &lt;br&gt;generalization led the Court to conclude that \"none of the evidence &lt;br&gt;produced by the city points to any identified discrimination in the &lt;br&gt;Richmond construction industry.\" Id. at 506. In this case, the &lt;br&gt;testimony of Trent, Jackson and others on the achievement gap, low &lt;br&gt;teacher expectations for minorities, and the causal connection to &lt;br&gt;prior discrimination in the Boston public schools was based on &lt;br&gt;extensive observations by skilled professionals of the conduct and &lt;br&gt;performance of students and teachers in the Boston schools, as well &lt;br&gt;as statistical evidence specific to those schools. &lt;br&gt;     The majority also asserts that \"Dr. Trent thus freely conceded &lt;br&gt;that the data he used [on teacher expectations] was not of the &lt;br&gt;quality necessary to satisfy the methodological rigors required by &lt;br&gt;his discipline.\"  I do not find this concession in Dr. Trent's  &lt;br&gt;testimony. In fact, during cross-examination, in response to a &lt;br&gt;question concerning whether it was reasonable for him to rely on &lt;br&gt;Deputy Superintendent Jackson's assessments of teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;in the Boston school system, Dr. Trent responded: \"In many &lt;br&gt;instances in the social sciences, qualitative researchers work with &lt;br&gt;information that is reported by the respondents. That is not &lt;br&gt;unusual.\"  Although a survey of teachers and other personnel in the &lt;br&gt;Boston school system would have provided a more substantial basis &lt;br&gt;for Dr. Trent's opinion on the existence of low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations for minorities, the absence of such empirical data &lt;br&gt;does not justify the majority's rejection of his testimony.   &lt;br&gt;     I also disagree with the majority that Trent's testimony &lt;br&gt;relied on \"evidence from one locality to establish the lingering &lt;br&gt;effects of discrimination in another\" in the manner criticized in &lt;br&gt;Croson.  Dr. Trent's expertise in identifying patterns of vestigal &lt;br&gt;effects of discrimination necessarily was acquired through his &lt;br&gt;prior studies of other school systems, including Kansas City.  He &lt;br&gt;did not attempt to use national statistics or statistics from other &lt;br&gt;localities to infer the existence of similar local conditions, as &lt;br&gt;was done by the city council in Croson.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at &lt;br&gt;504. &lt;br&gt;     The Committee's evidence on the connection between prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination and low teacher expectations, and low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations and the achievement gap, was undeniably a mix of &lt;br&gt;statistical and anecdotal evidence. Although the majority finds &lt;br&gt;this mix unacceptable, courts have often held that statistical &lt;br&gt;evidence documenting a disparate impact or a pattern or practice of &lt;br&gt;disparate treatment can combine with anecdotal evidence of acts of &lt;br&gt;discrimination to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.  &lt;br&gt;     In International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, &lt;br&gt;431 U.S. 324, 334-38 (1977), statistical evidence on outcome &lt;br&gt;(namely, the low number of minority truck drivers compared to the &lt;br&gt;relevant qualified pool) was supported by individual testimony on &lt;br&gt;prior discrimination (over forty acts of explicit discrimination &lt;br&gt;against minority aspirants). These testimonials \"brought the cold &lt;br&gt;numbers convincingly to life.\"  Id. at 339. In Coral Construction &lt;br&gt;Co. v. King County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566427\"><a href=\"/opinion/566427/coral-construction-company-an-oregon-corporation-oregon-columbia-chapter/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 919 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. &lt;br&gt;denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></span> (1992), the Ninth Circuit warned of the &lt;br&gt;dangers of relying overly on either statistics or anecdotal &lt;br&gt;accounts, individually, to establish a widespread pattern of &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  Nonetheless, the court found that \"the combination &lt;br&gt;of convincing anecdotal and statistical evidence is potent.\" 941 &lt;br&gt;F.2d at 919.  In EEOC v. O &amp; G Spring and Wire Forms Specialty Co., &lt;br&gt;38 F.3d 872, 878 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></span> &lt;br&gt;(1995), statistical evidence established only that the employer in &lt;br&gt;question had no African-American employees; the anecdotal evidence, &lt;br&gt;limited to a sampling of four disappointed applicants, was relevant &lt;br&gt;to demonstrating discriminatory conduct. The plaintiffs &lt;br&gt;successfully established a prima facie case of a pattern or &lt;br&gt;practice of disparate treatment. In Ensley Branch, NAACP v. &lt;br&gt;Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass'n 117, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676060\"><a href=\"/opinion/676060/ensley-branch-naacp-donald-nixon-william-moss-alvin-mahaffey-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1548</span></a></span>, 1565 (11th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1994), the Eleventh Circuit stated that anecdotal evidence could be &lt;br&gt;\"used to document discrimination, especially if buttressed by &lt;br&gt;relevant statistical evidence.\" &lt;br&gt;     In the instant case, experienced school administrators and &lt;br&gt;officials, such as Superintendent Payzant and Vice-Chair Gittens, &lt;br&gt;offered their judgment, on the basis of extensive day to day &lt;br&gt;experience with the Boston school system, that there were links &lt;br&gt;between prior discrimination in the system, low teacher &lt;br&gt;expectations, and the achievement gap. Dr. Trent offered his expert &lt;br&gt;opinion on these links without challenge to the admissibility of &lt;br&gt;his testimony.  He testified that his conclusions were based on a &lt;br&gt;reasonable methodology in his profession.  He evaluated statistics &lt;br&gt;documenting student performance and teacher histories in the Boston &lt;br&gt;school system. He studied the observations of a well-trained &lt;br&gt;administrator in the Boston school system describing teacher &lt;br&gt;performances in the classroom, the impact of these performances on &lt;br&gt;students, and faulty attempts to alter teacher attitudes. He knew &lt;br&gt;the history of segregation in the Boston school system.  Seeing &lt;br&gt;statistics and patterns in Boston that he had observed in other &lt;br&gt;school systems where he had found a link between student &lt;br&gt;achievement gaps and prior discrimination, he testified to the &lt;br&gt;probability of such a link in the Boston school system. He had an &lt;br&gt;adequate basis for making that judgment. &lt;br&gt;     The majority also finds fault with Dr. Trent's testimony, and &lt;br&gt;the Committee's case generally, because of the failure to control &lt;br&gt;for \"competing explanations for current realities.\" In the &lt;br&gt;majority's view, the Committee's evidence had to account for other &lt;br&gt;variables that might explain all or part of the achievement gap in &lt;br&gt;terms of societal discrimination. This insistence reflects a &lt;br&gt;misconception of the School Committee's evidentiary burden, and &lt;br&gt;would elevate the Committee's evidentiary burden far beyond the &lt;br&gt;prima facie standard contemplated in the Title VII cases.  The &lt;br&gt;Committee did not have to present proof that would permit the court &lt;br&gt;to make an independent finding of causation.  The Committee had to &lt;br&gt;satisfy the court that the Committee had before it a strong basis &lt;br&gt;in evidence for its judgment that the achievement gap is linked to &lt;br&gt;past discrimination in the Boston school system. As indicated by &lt;br&gt;the discussion of the Supreme Court and First Circuit precedents in &lt;br&gt;Part II, that strong basis is provided by a prima facie case of &lt;br&gt;causation. In voluntarily undertaking remedial measures, the School &lt;br&gt;Committee did not have to establish an airtight case for its own &lt;br&gt;liability to minority students. By setting the bar of proof for the &lt;br&gt;School Committee unrealistically high, the majority has ignored &lt;br&gt;precedents that impose only a prima facie burden on the School &lt;br&gt;Committee. &lt;br&gt;     Contrary to the majority, I believe that Boston Police &lt;br&gt;Superior Officers Federation v. City of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198025\"><a href=\"/opinion/198025/boston-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span> (1st &lt;br&gt;Cir. 1998), where we upheld an affirmative action program, supports &lt;br&gt;the conclusion that the School Committee satisfied its evidentiary &lt;br&gt;burden to justify the remedial measure. In Boston Police, we first &lt;br&gt;relied upon \"the BPD's history of racial discrimination [that] is &lt;br&gt;well-documented in the decisions of this court.\" Id. at 20. We &lt;br&gt;described the twenty years of litigation attempting to remedy the &lt;br&gt;department's discrimination against African-Americans. We relied &lt;br&gt;upon court findings made seven years prior to the litigation at &lt;br&gt;issue and specifically noted that \"we do not think this evidence is &lt;br&gt;too temporally remote to justify the conclusion that the BPD's past &lt;br&gt;racial discrimination has manifest effects in the present status of &lt;br&gt;black officers.\" Id.  We considered the statistical evidence that &lt;br&gt;demonstrated a continuing disparity between African-American and &lt;br&gt;white police officers being promoted to lieutenant positions.  We &lt;br&gt;then concluded:  &lt;br&gt;     This tortuous history, combined with the persistent &lt;br&gt;     effects of discriminatory practices at the entry and &lt;br&gt;     sergeant levels, sufficiently links the BPD's past &lt;br&gt;     discrimination and the statistical disparities &lt;br&gt;     contemporaneous with Ruiz's promotion.  Given the BPD's &lt;br&gt;     halting and, at times, quite modest progress in remedying &lt;br&gt;     its earlier discrimination, we are reluctant to infer &lt;br&gt;     that the vestiges of that discrimination had &lt;br&gt;     substantially disappeared when the BPD promoted Ruiz. The &lt;br&gt;     evidence warranted the district court's conclusion that &lt;br&gt;     the 1996 \"statistical disparity combines with judicial &lt;br&gt;     findings of past entry-level discrimination by the BPD to &lt;br&gt;     imply convincingly that historical discrimination has &lt;br&gt;     affected the promotion of minority sergeants to the rank &lt;br&gt;     of lieutenant, and that the lingering effects of that &lt;br&gt;     discrimination were present in 1995 when the BPD promoted &lt;br&gt;     Ruiz.\" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Id. at 22-23 (citations omitted).  Implicit in our decision in &lt;br&gt;Boston Police was the common sense proposition that a long history &lt;br&gt;of discrimination in a social institution affects for a &lt;br&gt;considerable period of time the attitudes and behavior of people &lt;br&gt;who have worked in that system.  Although such history, standing &lt;br&gt;alone, cannot provide the strong basis in evidence for a public &lt;br&gt;entity's adoption of an affirmative action program, it can &lt;br&gt;contribute to the evidentiary basis underlying the judgment that &lt;br&gt;there is a causal relationship between a current outcome, such as &lt;br&gt;an achievement gap, and past discrimination.  The Committee &lt;br&gt;appropriately invokes that history to support, in part, its &lt;br&gt;admission program for Boston Latin.  &lt;br&gt;     I am concerned that the majority's evidentiary requirements in &lt;br&gt;this case will force school systems contemplating affirmative &lt;br&gt;action programs designed to address the effects of past &lt;br&gt;discrimination to establish, through the collection of quantifiable &lt;br&gt;social science data, that past discrimination is the sole or &lt;br&gt;primary cause of variable achievement. Given the Supreme Court's &lt;br&gt;emphasis on the prima facie justification for such an initiative, &lt;br&gt;I conclude that \"substantial factor\" causation meets the causal &lt;br&gt;burden of production for a prima facie case. In his dissent in &lt;br&gt;Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112270\"><a href=\"/opinion/112270/wards-cove-packing-co-v-atonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span> (1989), Justice &lt;br&gt;Stevens noted that under existing law the notion of a prima facie &lt;br&gt;case under Title VII contemplates a similar standard. As he put it, &lt;br&gt;the asserted causal link between the acts of an employer and the &lt;br&gt;harm to a Title VII plaintiff  \"must have substance\" but \"need not &lt;br&gt;constitute the sole or primary cause of the harm.\" Id. at 672-73 &lt;br&gt;(Stevens, J., dissenting).  This standard reflects the general tort &lt;br&gt;standard embodied in the Restatement; See Restatement (Second) of &lt;br&gt;Torts  430-433 (1965). As Justice Stevens also noted, it is &lt;br&gt;consistent with the views of a majority of Justices in Price &lt;br&gt;Waterhouse v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span> (1989). It is also consistent &lt;br&gt;with Congress' response to that decision in the 1991 Civil Rights &lt;br&gt;Act. &lt;br&gt;     The evidence presented by the School Committee established a &lt;br&gt;prima facie case that differential teacher expectations, grounded &lt;br&gt;in the long history of segregation in the Boston school system, &lt;br&gt;were a substantial causal factor in the undeniable achievement gap &lt;br&gt;found in the Boston school system. In the face of this evidence, &lt;br&gt;Wessmann had the burden of challenging the Committee's prima facie &lt;br&gt;case by disproving the alleged causal linkages between prior &lt;br&gt;discrimination, teacher expectations, and the achievement gap. &lt;br&gt;4. Plaintiff's evidence challenging the causal link &lt;br&gt;     Wessmann conceded the existence of the achievement gap but &lt;br&gt;attempted to rebut the causal explanation advanced by the Committee &lt;br&gt;by asserting a \"neutral explanation\" for the disparities (that is, &lt;br&gt;that they were due to socioeconomic conditions attributable, at &lt;br&gt;most, to societal discrimination). Wessmann's only witness on these &lt;br&gt;matters, Professor Stephan Thernstrom, hypothesized that three &lt;br&gt;variables poverty rates, levels of education, and family &lt;br&gt;structures might be the cause of the achievement gap in the Boston &lt;br&gt;system. He based his hypothesis on national statistical evidence &lt;br&gt;that demonstrates powerful relationships between low achievement &lt;br&gt;and poverty rates, levels of education and family structure. &lt;br&gt;Professor Thernstrom suggested that, if a controlled study had been &lt;br&gt;done to isolate the causes of the achievement gap, the study would &lt;br&gt;have revealed that any causal connection between the achievement &lt;br&gt;gap and teacher expectations was insignificant. He further rejected &lt;br&gt;the Committee's argument that low teacher expectations are &lt;br&gt;connected to prior discrimination on the basis that the Committee &lt;br&gt;did not conduct a study on this issue. &lt;br&gt;     During cross-examination, Professor Thernstrom acknowledged &lt;br&gt;that he had no data particular to Boston on any alternative causes &lt;br&gt;of the achievement gap, thus confirming his reliance on the &lt;br&gt;national statistics criticized by the Supreme Court in Croson.  He &lt;br&gt;also acknowledged that, in his recent book evaluating the causes of &lt;br&gt;a national achievement gap between students, he had written that &lt;br&gt;neither poverty rates, levels of education, nor family structure &lt;br&gt;could account for the national achievement gap between African- &lt;br&gt;American and white students. In fact, in a chapter titled \"Low &lt;br&gt;Expectations, Low Performance,\" he stated that \"ask little of &lt;br&gt;children in the way of academic achievement and little is what you &lt;br&gt;tend to get.\" In that chapter, he specifically cited actions of the &lt;br&gt;Boston School Committee in 1990, and stated that the Boston public &lt;br&gt;schools \"were failing to do their job and most of all failing &lt;br&gt;African-American pupils.\" &lt;br&gt;     As the district court noted in its opinion, the one expert &lt;br&gt;witness to testify on Wessmann's behalf conceded that, ultimately, &lt;br&gt;alternative theories of causation could not fully explain the &lt;br&gt;achievement gap between white and African-American students. &lt;br&gt;Hearing this evidence, the district court rejected Thernstrom's &lt;br&gt;direct testimony and accepted only his cross-examination testimony, &lt;br&gt;along with other evidence presented by the Committee, in reaching &lt;br&gt;its conclusion that the Boston Latin admissions program &lt;br&gt;\"appropriately addressed the vestiges of discrimination that linger &lt;br&gt;in the Boston Public School system.\" 996 F. Supp. at 131. &lt;br&gt;     By asserting that the district court erred in crediting the &lt;br&gt;extensive observational testimony of experienced, well-trained &lt;br&gt;school administrators, and by requiring quantifiable data to &lt;br&gt;establish a causal link between past discrimination and present &lt;br&gt;outcomes, the majority would reduce strict scrutiny to a standard &lt;br&gt;that is indeed \"fatal in fact.\" See Adarand, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 237 &lt;br&gt;(1995).  In my view, the district court properly concluded that the &lt;br&gt;School Committee had a strong basis in evidence for adoption of the &lt;br&gt;Boston Latin admissions program, thereby meeting its evidentiary &lt;br&gt;burden, and that the plaintiff failed to carry her burden of &lt;br&gt;persuading the court that this affirmative action program was &lt;br&gt;unconstitutional. &lt;br&gt;                              IV. &lt;br&gt;Narrow Tailoring &lt;br&gt;     To survive strict scrutiny, the School Committee's admissions &lt;br&gt;program must serve a compelling interest in remedying past &lt;br&gt;discrimination and must also be narrowly tailored to serve that &lt;br&gt;goal. \"When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling &lt;br&gt;interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it &lt;br&gt;satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in &lt;br&gt;previous cases.\" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237. United States v. &lt;br&gt;Paradise, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span> (1987), is the leading Supreme Court case on &lt;br&gt;the meaning of narrow tailoring. It emphasizes the following &lt;br&gt;factors: \"the necessity for the relief and the efficacy of &lt;br&gt;alternative remedies; the flexibility and duration of the relief, &lt;br&gt;including the availability of waiver provisions; the relationship &lt;br&gt;of the numerical goals to the relevant labor market; and the impact &lt;br&gt;of the relief on the rights of third parties.\" Id. at 171.  &lt;br&gt;Fundamentally, narrow tailoring analysis asks whether a program is &lt;br&gt;\"overinclusive\" or \"underinclusive\" to serve the purposes of the &lt;br&gt;specific compelling interest on which the program is based.  Seegenerally id. at 190 n.1 (Stevens, J., concurring); Church of the &lt;br&gt;Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 546 &lt;br&gt;(1993). &lt;br&gt;      The following language from Croson offers some insight into &lt;br&gt;the rationale underlying these factors: &lt;br&gt;     [The narrow tailoring prong of strict scrutiny analysis] &lt;br&gt;     ensures that the means chosen \"fit\" [the] compelling goal &lt;br&gt;     so closely that there is little or no possibility that &lt;br&gt;     the motive for the [racial] classification was &lt;br&gt;     illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;          Classifications based on race carry a danger of &lt;br&gt;     stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for &lt;br&gt;     remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of &lt;br&gt;     racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial &lt;br&gt;     hostility. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Croson, 488 U.S. at 493. On this account, the \"narrow tailoring\" &lt;br&gt;and \"compelling interest\" requirements serve the same purpose: &lt;br&gt;ensuring that the program in question is not simply motivated by a &lt;br&gt;desire to favor one race. \"Narrow tailoring\" serves the additional &lt;br&gt;purpose of minimizing inadvertent harms that may result from an &lt;br&gt;affirmative action program, on the basis of a \"cost-benefit\" &lt;br&gt;analysis. Given these narrow tailoring considerations, I am &lt;br&gt;satisfied that the School Committee has produced a race-conscious &lt;br&gt;admissions program for Boston Latin which is narrowly tailored to &lt;br&gt;address a compelling remedial goal. &lt;br&gt;1. Flexibility and Duration of the Relief &lt;br&gt;     The admissions program's racial/ethnic composition standards &lt;br&gt;automatically vary each year with the composition of the Qualified &lt;br&gt;Applicant Pool. The record indicates that there has been some case- &lt;br&gt;by-case flexibility in the past: a well-qualified Native American &lt;br&gt;admittee who would not have been admitted under a mechanical &lt;br&gt;application of the program's guidelines (there was too low a &lt;br&gt;percentage of Native Americans in the qualified pool that year to &lt;br&gt;have a spot allocated to that racial/ethnic group) was nonetheless &lt;br&gt;admitted after a glance at the straight composite-score ranking &lt;br&gt;indicated this student had placed above the lowest-ranked admittee. &lt;br&gt;     The limited duration requirement has generally been met by &lt;br&gt;\"built-in mechanisms\" to shrink the scope and limit the duration of &lt;br&gt;remedial programs. See Boston Police, 147 F.3d at 23, 24-25 &lt;br&gt;(quoting Mackin v.

The policy at issue here is &lt;br&gt;explicitly subject to review. The superintendent must present &lt;br&gt;findings and recommended modifications to the Committee every three &lt;br&gt;years.  The district court found that the review provision \"ensures &lt;br&gt;that the Policy will not outlive the examination schools' &lt;br&gt;compelling need for it.\" 996 F. Supp. at 132. While it is not &lt;br&gt;\"self-terminating\" in an involuntary, mechanical sense, nothing &lt;br&gt;about this race preference implies permanence in the sense of the &lt;br&gt;Supreme Court's general warning against \"remedies that are ageless &lt;br&gt;in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to &lt;br&gt;affect the future.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 276 (plurality); see alsoCroson, 488 U.S. at 498. &lt;br&gt;2. Relationship of the Numerical Goals to the Composition of the &lt;br&gt;Qualified Pool &lt;br&gt;     This element of narrow tailoring assures that the &lt;br&gt;beneficiaries of any program will be qualified, thereby minimizing &lt;br&gt;the cost of the preference to society while assuring that the &lt;br&gt;favored applicants are not unjustly enriched. Cases approving &lt;br&gt;preferences in the promotions of police officers cite the &lt;br&gt;\"relationship of the [program's] numerical goals to the relevant &lt;br&gt;labor market,\" Paradise, 480 U.S. at 171, or the fact that the &lt;br&gt;preference is directed accurately towards \"the smaller group of &lt;br&gt;individuals who possess the necessary qualifications . . . .\" &lt;br&gt;Boston Police, 147 F.3d at 21 (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at 501). &lt;br&gt;This \"qualification\" factor does not make the transition from the &lt;br&gt;employment to the educational context gracefully: education, after &lt;br&gt;all, is directed at shaping individuals in a prospective manner. &lt;br&gt;Students ranking in the lower half of the applicant pool by &lt;br&gt;composite score had succeeded at Boston Latin in the past &lt;br&gt;(Headmaster Contompassis recalled one in the sixty-fourth &lt;br&gt;percentile from the top who graduated near the top of his class). &lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, the Committee's admissions program has clearly been &lt;br&gt;structured to meet this qualification requirement. No one is &lt;br&gt;admitted, on account of the \"flexible racial/ethnic guidelines,\" &lt;br&gt;from outside the qualified applicant pool (or even from anywhere &lt;br&gt;near the median score point).  In fact, for the 1997-1998 school &lt;br&gt;year, all students admitted were within the top 10.6% (by composite &lt;br&gt;score rank) of the applicant pool. &lt;br&gt;3. Impact of the Relief on the Rights of Third Parties &lt;br&gt;     In Paradise, the Court asked if the promotion preference given &lt;br&gt;in that case was an \"absolute bar\" to advancement. See Paradise, &lt;br&gt;480 U.S. at 171, 182-83 (quoting Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers v. &lt;br&gt;EEOC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111747\"><a href=\"/opinion/111747/sheet-metal-workers-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 481 (1986)). Without minimizing the &lt;br&gt;disappointment Sarah Wessmann feels at her exclusion from Boston &lt;br&gt;Latin, the answer to the analogous inquiry in this case is clearly &lt;br&gt;\"no.\" Forty-five spots were open to Wessmann on the basis of &lt;br&gt;composite score alone, and several times as many were available &lt;br&gt;when Wessmann attempted to enter at the seventh grade level (even &lt;br&gt;accounting for the 35% set-aside which existed during that year).  &lt;br&gt;     The numerous employment promotion-preference cases also ask &lt;br&gt;whether the preference imposes a layoff-like burden, i.e., whether &lt;br&gt;it defeats legitimate entrenched expectations of the disfavored. &lt;br&gt;Layoffs raise more severe narrow tailoring concerns than a hiring &lt;br&gt;preference: &lt;br&gt;     In cases involving valid hiring goals, the burden to be &lt;br&gt;     borne by innocent individuals is diffused to a &lt;br&gt;     considerable extent among society generally.  Though &lt;br&gt;     hiring goals may burden some innocent individuals, they &lt;br&gt;     simply do not impose the same kind of injury that layoffs &lt;br&gt;     impose.  Denial of a future employment opportunity is not &lt;br&gt;     as intrusive as loss of an existing job. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wygant, 467 U.S. at 282-83. Rather than being removed from a &lt;br&gt;superior school because of a racial preference, Wessmann was denied &lt;br&gt;the opportunity to move from a good school to a better school. &lt;br&gt;There is no constitutional right to attend a school of one's &lt;br&gt;choice. See Johnson v. Bd. of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369140\"><a href=\"/opinion/369140/kathy-sue-johnson-etc-and-darcel-milton-etc-v-board-of-education-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 515 (7th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1979); United States v. Perry Cty. Bd. of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351574\"><a href=\"/opinion/351574/united-states-v-perry-county-board-of-education-joann-parsons/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 279 &lt;br&gt;(5th Cir. 1978). It is true that Wessmann, unlike the non-promoted &lt;br&gt;police officers in Stuart or Boston Police, will not have another &lt;br&gt;chance to enter Boston Latin. However, her situation resembles &lt;br&gt;denial of a promotion with retention of current job status: she &lt;br&gt;remains at the Latin Academy which, while not the equal of the &lt;br&gt;Latin School in terms of overall student performance, is &lt;br&gt;nonetheless \"challenging\" Wessmann, according to the affidavit of &lt;br&gt;her Headmaster, the trial testimony of her father, and other &lt;br&gt;evidence in the record. &lt;br&gt;4. Necessity of Relief to Achieve the Compelling Interest, and the &lt;br&gt;Efficacy of Alternative Remedies. &lt;br&gt;(a) Necessity of relief to achieve the compelling interest &lt;br&gt;     \"To evaluate [a determination of necessity] we must examine &lt;br&gt;the purposes [a preference program] was intended to serve.\" &lt;br&gt;Paradise, 480 U.S. at 171. Here, that goal is to overcome &lt;br&gt;expeditiously the effects of past discrimination in the Boston &lt;br&gt;schools. Urgency of relief is a legitimate consideration in finding &lt;br&gt;necessity. See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 173-77.  If admissions had &lt;br&gt;been based on straight rank order for the 1997-1998 school year, &lt;br&gt;the percentage of those invited to the seventh grade who were &lt;br&gt;African-American would have dropped from 13% to 6%; for Hispanics &lt;br&gt;the drop would have been from 5% to 3%. For the ninth grade, the &lt;br&gt;dropoff would have been 21% to 14% for African-Americans and 10% to &lt;br&gt;7% for Hispanics. Given the low levels of African-American and &lt;br&gt;Hispanic students who would have been admitted to Boston Latin on &lt;br&gt;a straight-from-the-top admissions methodology (in comparison to &lt;br&gt;either the general population, the composition of the entire public &lt;br&gt;school system, or of the qualified applicant pool), a preferential &lt;br&gt;program was required to remedy the lingering effects of de jure &lt;br&gt;segregation in the system. &lt;br&gt;     Given that one of the standards for evaluating narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring is over- or under-inclusiveness to the purpose, one might &lt;br&gt;ask whether this program is \"underinclusive\" to address the &lt;br&gt;remedial needs facing the School Committee. The ultimate impact in &lt;br&gt;numbers is small eleven of ninety invitees to the ninth grade, and &lt;br&gt;thirty-seven of 440 to the seventh, were admitted who would not &lt;br&gt;have been if straight rank order admissions had been used. Overall, &lt;br&gt;the preference affects outcome for about 9% of all admittees. The &lt;br&gt;resulting representation of African-Americans and Hispanics in the &lt;br&gt;student body of Boston Latin does not even approach proportionality &lt;br&gt;with the composition of the Boston public school system as a whole, &lt;br&gt;which is 74% African-American and Hispanic. &lt;br&gt;     Wessmann asserts that underinclusivity is evidence that the &lt;br&gt;program is only intended to address an interest in diversity. Where &lt;br&gt;affirmative action deals with selective programs like promotions or &lt;br&gt;competitive schools, however, the impact of the preference may have &lt;br&gt;to be small because of the narrow tailoring requirement that &lt;br&gt;beneficiaries be qualified. Any preference can only respond to &lt;br&gt;remedial needs in proportion to the success of minorities in &lt;br&gt;raising themselves into the qualified pool. Thus, the preference in &lt;br&gt;Stuart, for example, gave \"only limited advantage\" to minority &lt;br&gt;applicants, increasing their numbers \"gradually over time.\" 951 &lt;br&gt;F.2d at 454. Under the circumstances, there is no grounds for &lt;br&gt;holding that the program here is not narrowly tailored towards the &lt;br&gt;remedial goal because it pursues that goal deliberately. &lt;br&gt;(b) Efficacy of alternative remedies &lt;br&gt;     The Committee adopted race neutral alternatives to work &lt;br&gt;towards a race-blind policy in the future. These alternatives &lt;br&gt;include more extensive schooling (extra classes during the school &lt;br&gt;year and summer school), enhanced school programs (the advanced &lt;br&gt;work classes), and admissions test preparatory courses in the &lt;br&gt;public schools feeding into the exam system. However, Professor &lt;br&gt;Edwin Melendez, a School Committee member, described the &lt;br&gt;alternatives as \"not a panacea to deal with the issue of unequal &lt;br&gt;access overnight,\" but rather as \"definitely a long-term strategy.\" &lt;br&gt;The alternatives did not address adequately the problem of urgency. &lt;br&gt;     The School Committee also considered alternative admissions &lt;br&gt;plans detailed by an outside consulting firm. Consideration of &lt;br&gt;these proposals was delegated to a special ad hoc Task Force, &lt;br&gt;composed of a broad array of concerned individuals and experts &lt;br&gt;including two members of the School Committee, Professor Charles &lt;br&gt;Ogletree of Harvard Law School, several individuals with experience &lt;br&gt;in formulating affirmative action programs, and numerous public &lt;br&gt;figures with personal connections to Boston Latin from various &lt;br&gt;ethnic communities within the city. The Task Force held eight &lt;br&gt;committee meetings and five neighborhood hearings, all open to the &lt;br&gt;public. The Task Force members discussed and evaluated the &lt;br&gt;consultant's initial proposals and then worked closely with the &lt;br&gt;consultants until a plan emerged that was satisfactory to the &lt;br&gt;remedial needs at issue here. This plan was presented by the Task &lt;br&gt;Force chairs to the School Committee, which also heard the views of &lt;br&gt;the dissenting members of the Task Force. Further public hearings &lt;br&gt;were held to consider the final Task Force report before it was &lt;br&gt;adopted by the Committee.  There is no indication in the record &lt;br&gt;that any less race conscious program was ever proposed to the &lt;br&gt;Committee (before or during this litigation) which could have &lt;br&gt;effected immediate remedial relief while simultaneously maximizing &lt;br&gt;the quality of the student body. &lt;br&gt;     Relying on Podberesky v. Kirwan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680721\"><a href=\"/opinion/680721/daniel-j-podberesky-v-william-e-kirwan-president-of-the-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 160-61 (4th Cir. &lt;br&gt;1994), Wessmann argues that the Committee must show that a &lt;br&gt;race-neutral policy was first tried, not just considered, and that &lt;br&gt;it failed to accomplish the goal in question. In that case, &lt;br&gt;however, Podberesky himself submitted the proposed race neutral &lt;br&gt;plan which piqued the interest of the Fourth Circuit. His plan had &lt;br&gt;obviously not been considered by the university. In this case, &lt;br&gt;several race neutral plans presented by the consulting firm to the &lt;br&gt;Committee were rejected after consideration as inadequate to the &lt;br&gt;purpose of immediate remediation. Moreover, there is no Supreme &lt;br&gt;Court authority for the proposition that implementation of a &lt;br&gt;racially-preferential plan must be preceded by a failed race- &lt;br&gt;neutral attempt to accomplish the same goals. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Majority's Narrow Tailoring Critique &lt;br&gt;     The majority cites three narrow tailoring deficiencies in the &lt;br&gt;Committee's admissions program: (1) African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;applicants from private schools were by definition not hurt by the &lt;br&gt;inadequacies of the public schools, and thus should not be allowed &lt;br&gt;to benefit from any remedial program; (2) basing admissions on the &lt;br&gt;composition of the remaining qualified applicant pool will not &lt;br&gt;necessarily benefit African-Americans and Hispanics, despite the &lt;br&gt;fact that the program is predicated on remedying past &lt;br&gt;discrimination against those groups; furthermore, the program &lt;br&gt;benefits racial groups not victimized by discrimination in the &lt;br&gt;Boston schools; and (3) the program does not directly address the &lt;br&gt;problem of lower teacher expectations.  The subtext of these &lt;br&gt;arguments is a suggestion that the program is justifiable only on &lt;br&gt;racial diversity grounds, and that it is tailored only towards a &lt;br&gt;form of racial balancing. &lt;br&gt;1. The inclusion of minority applicants from private schools &lt;br&gt;     Our Constitution has always protected the right of parents to &lt;br&gt;choose a school by moving to another district, by opting into a &lt;br&gt;suburban busing program like METCO, or by sending their children &lt;br&gt;to private school. It therefore seems incongruous to punish the &lt;br&gt;initiative of those who removed their children from an educational &lt;br&gt;environment tainted by vestiges of discrimination. Moreover, there &lt;br&gt;is no reason to assume that leaving the public school system was &lt;br&gt;not in itself a burden on these families. If there were hardships &lt;br&gt;involved for families that fled the public schools (tuition, &lt;br&gt;transportation, adjusting in general to the transition), those &lt;br&gt;hardships could be fairly linked to the past discrimination that &lt;br&gt;made the public schools an unacceptable environment for their &lt;br&gt;children in the first place. &lt;br&gt;2. Potential disfavoring of groups subject to past discrimination; &lt;br&gt;separate categorization of whites, Asians and Native Americans &lt;br&gt;     The majority notes that Hispanics, \"archetypical victims of &lt;br&gt;discrimination,\" could potentially be disfavored by the program &lt;br&gt;under a hypothetical scenario whereby their representation in the &lt;br&gt;remaining qualified applicant pool was concentrated near the top of &lt;br&gt;the composite score rankings.  That potential for Hispanics (or, &lt;br&gt;for that matter, African-Americans) to be disfavored at Boston &lt;br&gt;Latin suggests some limitations in the Committee's remedial &lt;br&gt;program. Those limitations do not discredit the program.  If the &lt;br&gt;facts in one particular year were so anomalous that the program &lt;br&gt;disfavored either African-Americans or Hispanics, the case-by-case &lt;br&gt;flexibility documented above could be invoked to remedy the &lt;br&gt;anomaly. &lt;br&gt;     The majority raises a troubling point when it questions the &lt;br&gt;School Committee's separate categorization of Asians under the &lt;br&gt;admissions program's racial/ethnic guidelines. Perhaps it would &lt;br&gt;have been preferable to group Asians together with whites and any &lt;br&gt;other identifiable groups against whom there was no asserted &lt;br&gt;history of discrimination. However, in the context of the long &lt;br&gt;history of de jure discrimination against African-Americans and &lt;br&gt;Hispanics in the Boston school system, this separate categorization &lt;br&gt;of Asians does not undermine the fundamental remedial purpose of &lt;br&gt;the admissions program. Moreover, the record suggests the &lt;br&gt;possibility of a remedial interest with regard to Asians. There is &lt;br&gt;evidence of a significant language-skills achievement gap for Asian &lt;br&gt;students in the public schools.  If there is future litigation &lt;br&gt;about this aspect of the program, more achievement gap evidence &lt;br&gt;relating to Asians might be produced. &lt;br&gt;3. Not directly addressing lower teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;     The majority opinion and the concurrence both find a narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring flaw because the School Committee's admissions program &lt;br&gt;does not directly address the problem of lower teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;for African-American and Hispanic students, identified by the &lt;br&gt;School Committee as a vestige of discrimination and a substantial &lt;br&gt;causal factor of the achievement gap. The admissions program is &lt;br&gt;designed to remedy the impact of lower teacher expectations, and &lt;br&gt;not the expectations themselves and is perfectly acceptable as &lt;br&gt;such. Although the School Committee has a responsibility to &lt;br&gt;eliminate the vestiges of discrimination from the system over time, &lt;br&gt;the Committee also has a responsibility to address the harm those &lt;br&gt;vestiges currently impose on African-American and Hispanic &lt;br&gt;students. &lt;br&gt;     If the School Committee was not simultaneously addressing the &lt;br&gt;underlying teacher expectations problem, there might be a narrow &lt;br&gt;tailoring concern related to the duration of the remedial program. &lt;br&gt;The School Committee is, in fact, addressing this underlying &lt;br&gt;problem. It has been making substantial efforts towards instituting &lt;br&gt;a standardized curriculum in the primary schools. A standard &lt;br&gt;curriculum sets forth what is expected from every student, &lt;br&gt;independently of what any individual teacher might otherwise expect &lt;br&gt;from any individual student. Under the Focus on Children reform &lt;br&gt;initiative, adopted in August 1996, citywide curricular standards &lt;br&gt;are to be implemented within five years. The School Committee is &lt;br&gt;also making more direct efforts to address the problem of teacher &lt;br&gt;bias. For several years it has retained the services of the &lt;br&gt;Efficacy Institute, an educational firm which had previously &lt;br&gt;undertaken large-scale teacher reeducation in the New York City &lt;br&gt;public schools. &lt;br&gt;                               V. &lt;br&gt;Conclusion &lt;br&gt;     The majority characterizes my dissent as \"wishful thinking\" &lt;br&gt;about the meaning of Wygant, Croson and other Supreme Court &lt;br&gt;precedents in this difficult area of the law. Not surprisingly, I &lt;br&gt;disagree. I believe that I am faithful to those precedents and, &lt;br&gt;unlike the majority, apply them accurately to the evidence &lt;br&gt;presented to the district court. &lt;br&gt;     The majority goes awry because it reads Wygant's requirement &lt;br&gt;of a \"strong basis in evidence\" for an affirmative action program &lt;br&gt;and Croson's reference to a \"searching judicial inquiry\" into the &lt;br&gt;justification for an affirmative action program as demands for &lt;br&gt;evidence grounded in quantifiable social science data rather than &lt;br&gt;human judgments.  There is no such demand in Wygant, Croson or any &lt;br&gt;other Supreme Court precedent. Numbers are not the only source of &lt;br&gt;the requisite degree of certainty about low teacher expectations &lt;br&gt;for minorities and causation. In this case, the extensive &lt;br&gt;observations of experienced administrators in the Boston public &lt;br&gt;schools, supplemented by the testimony of a highly qualified expert &lt;br&gt;who recognized in the Boston public schools a phenomenon he had &lt;br&gt;studied extensively elsewhere, were as probative as the statistical &lt;br&gt;surveys and regression analyses demanded by the majority. &lt;br&gt;     The majority also goes awry because it uses Croson's reference &lt;br&gt;to a \"searching judicial inquiry\" as the basis for disregarding two &lt;br&gt;critical points made by Justice O'Connor in Wygant: &lt;br&gt;     (1) The strong basis in evidence required of a public &lt;br&gt;     entity defending an affirmative action program in court &lt;br&gt;     is provided by evidence sufficient to support a prima &lt;br&gt;     facie case of discrimination against the favored &lt;br&gt;     minority. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     (2) \"In 'reverse discrimination' suits, as in any other &lt;br&gt;     suit, it is the plaintiffs who must bear the burden of &lt;br&gt;     demonstrating that their rights have been violated.\" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We applied this evidentiary framework in Stuart, thereby signaling &lt;br&gt;to the district court its applicability in this affirmative action &lt;br&gt;case. The district court followed that teaching, and we should as &lt;br&gt;well. &lt;br&gt;     For all of the reasons stated herein, I would affirm the &lt;br&gt;judgment of the district court.&lt;/pre&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",
