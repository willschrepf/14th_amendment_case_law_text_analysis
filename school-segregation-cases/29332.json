After passage of the Three Strikes Reform\n\nAct (Reform Act) in November 2012, defendant filed a petition to recall the sentence and\n\nfor resentencing pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.126. The trial court found\n\ndefendant eligible to apply for resentencing, but denied defendant’s petition on the\n\nmerits, finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to the public.\n\nDefendant appeals, contending that the trial court applied the wrong standard,\n\nmisallocated the burden of proof, considered improper matters, and otherwise abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his petition. We affirm.\n\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       When defendant was 16 years old, he was adjudicated a ward of the court for\n\nrobbery and aggravated assault when he participated with an armed accomplice in taking\n\njewelry by force from a victim in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Defendant was\n\nthen committed to the California Youth Authority (Youth Authority) for eight years, but\n\nwas released after three or four years when he was 20 years old.\n\n       In 1991, while defendant was still on parole after his release from the Youth\n\nAuthority, and before his 21st birthday, he committed another robbery. He and two\n\naccomplices robbed the clerk of a convenience store. One of the accomplices was armed\n\nwith a knife. Defendant was sentenced to prison for three years.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f          Defendant was on parole in 1993 when he entered a shoe store with two\n\naccomplices; one of the accomplices was armed with a gun. Defendant helped herd the\n\nstore employees into the back room. Defendant pushed one of the employees to the floor,\n\nand an accomplice threatened to kill the employees. Defendant assisted his companions\n\nby tying their hands with duct tape. Defendant and his accomplices emptied the cash\n\nregister, tripping a silent alarm. Responding officers arrested defendant and his\n\naccomplices. Defendant was again convicted of robbery, and a finding was made that a\n\nprincipal was armed with a firearm in the commission of the offense. Defendant was\n\nsentenced to nine years in prison.\n\n          These three robbery offenses were alleged as strikes in 1999, when defendant was\n\ncharged with new offenses. Defendant evidently had been paroled after his 1993 robbery\n\nconviction some time in 1998. In 1999, an incident occurred when a search warrant was\n\nexecuted while defendant was sitting in a car parked in front of his girlfriend’s apartment.\n\nDefendant was detained while the search was being carried out. Defendant at first denied\n\nliving in the apartment, but then admitted he stayed there sometimes. The searching\n\nofficers found a bag of cocaine under some rocks near the front door of the apartment,\n\nmore cocaine hidden in a bathroom vent, and some marijuana. They also found an\n\nunloaded handgun concealed in a sock and hidden in the attic crawl space in the bedroom\n\ncloset.\n\n          Defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, possession\n\nof cocaine base for sale, and possession of marijuana. Defendant pleaded guilty to the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fmisdemeanor charge of marijuana possession, and was tried on the remaining charges.\n\nThe information also alleged two strike priors and two prior prison terms.\n\n       Defendant’s girlfriend testified at trial that the cocaine base belonged to defendant,\n\nand that she had seen him selling cocaine outside the apartment. Defendant had told\n\npolice at first that he knew nothing about the cocaine. Later, defendant said that some of\n\nhis friends had sold cocaine, but he still denied personal participation. Some of the\n\nofficers testified that defendant admitted obtaining the gun for protection. Defendant’s\n\ngirlfriend testified at trial that defendant had brought the gun to the apartment, and he had\n\ntold his girlfriend that he got it for protection. Defendant denied making any such\n\nadmission, however, and claimed that he had never seen the gun before the officers found\n\nit on the night of the search. The jury acquitted defendant on the charge of possession of\n\ncocaine base for sale, but did convict him of unlawful possession of a firearm by an ex-\n\nfelon. The trial court found true the prison term and strike allegations. In August 2000,\n\nthe court sentenced defendant as a third striker to a term of 25 years to life for the\n\npossession of a firearm charge, plus two one-year terms for the prior prison term\n\nconvictions, for a total term of 27 years to life.\n\n       In November 2012, the electorate passed Proposition 36, the Reform Act. The\n\nReform Act permits certain persons sentenced as third strikers to petition for recall of the\n\nsentence and for resentencing as a second striker, when the third strike offense is not a\n\nserious or violent felony. (See Pen. Code, § 1170.126.) Defendant requested\n\nappointment of counsel to assist in filing a petition. A petition was duly filed on April\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f23, 2013. The People filed an opposition memorandum. The trial court heard\n\ndefendant’s petition on May 23, 2013. The court found that defendant was eligible for\n\nresentencing under the statute—i.e., he was not otherwise disqualified. The court denied\n\ndefendant’s petition, however, finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to the public were he to be released.\n\n       Defendant filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                  I. Standard of Review\n\n       The Reform Act amended the “Three Strikes” law to change the effect on\n\nsentencing if an offender’s third strike offense is not a serious or violent felony. Under\n\nthe former law, a recidivist offender who had two or more prior strikes, and who was\n\nconvicted of any new felony, was subject to an indeterminate life sentence. The Reform\n\nAct changed the Three Strikes law so that a life sentence for a third strike would be\n\nimposed only where the current offense is a serious or violent (strike) felony or where the\n\nprosecution has pled and proved an enumerated disqualifying factor. In all other cases,\n\nthe offender will now be sentenced as a second strike offender. (Pen. Code, §§ 667,\n\n1170.12.) The Reform Act also created a proceeding for postconviction relief for\n\nprisoners who are serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the Three\n\nStrikes law for a crime that was not a serious or violent felony and who are subject to\n\nother disqualifying factors. Once a prisoner has met the requirements for eligibility for\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fresentencing under Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e),1 then the prisoner\n\n“shall be resentenced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 and\n\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 unless the court, in its discretion,\n\ndetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (f), italics added.)\n\n       In exercising its discretion, “the court may consider:\n\n       “(1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\n\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\n\nthe remoteness of the crimes;\n\n       “(2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\n\nincarcerated; and\n\n\n\n\n       1  Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), provides: “(e) An inmate is\neligible for resentencing if:\n        “(1) The inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed\npursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section\n1170.12 for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or\nviolent felonies by subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.\n        “(2) The inmate’s current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses\nappearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.\n        “(3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses appearing in\nclause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\nclause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.”\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f        “(3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant\n\nin deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n\n        Review of the trial court’s ruling on the petition involves more than one issue. In\n\npart, we are called upon to determine the meaning of Penal Code section 1170.126,\n\nparticularly the provision that states: “the petitioner shall be resentenced . . . unless the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (f), italics\n\nadded.) We independently determine issues of law, such as the interpretation and\n\nconstruction of statutory language. (People v. Love (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 276, 284.)\n\nThe principles of statutory interpretation apply to voter initiatives, as well as to\n\nenactments of the legislature. (Ramos v. Superior Court (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 719,\n\n727.)\n\n        Beyond any issues of statutory interpretation, we are also called upon to review\n\nthe trial court’s discretionary ruling, finding that a new sentence would represent an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to the public. We review the trial court’s discretionary\n\nrulings for abuse of that discretion. When the standard of review is abuse of discretion,\n\nthe reviewing court “examines the ruling of the trial court and asks whether it exceeds the\n\nbounds of reason or is arbitrary, whimsical or capricious. [Citations.] This standard\n\ninvolves abundant deference to the trial court’s rulings.” (People v. Jackson (2005) 128\n\nCal.App.4th 1009, 1018.)\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fII. The Prosecution Bore the Burden of Establishing Dangerousness by a Preponderance\n\n                                       of the Evidence\n\n       In People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279 (Kaulick), the\n\nCourt of Appeal described the three-step process for considering petitions for\n\nresentencing under Penal Code section 1170.126. “First, the court must determine\n\nwhether the prisoner is [statutorily] eligible for resentencing; second, the court must\n\ndetermine whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety; and third, if the prisoner is eligible and resentencing would not pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger, the court must actually resentence the prisoner.” (Kaulick,\n\nsupra, at p. 1299, italics omitted.)\n\n       The Kaulick court also took note of the express language of Penal Code section\n\n1170.126, subdivision (f), that an eligible petitioner “shall be resentenced” as a second\n\nstriker, “unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” The parties in Kaulick\n\nagreed, as do we, that this language places a burden of proof on the prosecution to\n\ndemonstrate dangerousness. The Kaulick court further held that the appropriate standard\n\nof proof was by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick),\n\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1305.)\n\n       Defendant points to various remarks of the trial court, and suggests that the\n\nremarks indicate that the trial court misallocated the burden of proof at the hearing,\n\nrequiring defendant to demonstrate that he would not be dangerous, as opposed to the\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fprosecution’s burden to show that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of\n\ndangerousness to the public. That is, the court stated at one point that it could not find,\n\n“even by a preponderance of the evidence, that I believe you’ll remain law abiding.” At\n\nanother point, the court remarked that, even though defendant’s relatives were supportive,\n\n“I don’t believe they would keep you law abiding[;] they hadn’t before.”\n\n       These statements by the court did not, however, indicate that the court had\n\nallocated the burden of proof to defendant on the issue of dangerousness. From the\n\nbeginning, the trial court properly focused on the issue: “whether [defendant] remains a\n\ndanger to the community.” The court was entitled to, and did, consider many aspects of\n\ndefendant’s past criminal behavior, his convicted prior offenses, his current conviction,\n\nand his conduct while in prison in assessing the question of his future dangerousness.\n\nMany of these factors were troubling on the issue of the risk of danger to the public. The\n\ncourt’s statements simply expressed its assessment that it was more likely than not\n\n(preponderance standard) that defendant would continue to pose an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety.\n\n       The court is presumed to be aware of the applicable legal standards, and defendant\n\nhas failed to rebut that presumption. The totality of the circumstances shows that the trial\n\ncourt had the proper issue and the proper considerations before it: whether the\n\nprosecution had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fIII. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Defendant’s Resentencing\n\n                                           Petition\n\n       Defendant raises several evidentiary issues. Defendant contends that the trial\n\ncourt exhibited an arbitrary and irrational bias in some of its statements, that the court\n\nmisinterpreted the evidence, that the court engaged in speculation about defendant’s\n\npsychological status without expert evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n       In addition to defendant’s past criminal record, the trial court also received\n\nevidence of defendant’s activities and disciplinary record while in prison.2 Over the\n\n       2  On the positive side of the ledger, after being incarcerated on his third robbery\nconviction in 1993, defendant earned some academic certificates (reading competency,\nlanguage competency, and mathematics competency) in 1996. In 1997, he received a\nqualifying score on a test meeting the requirements of the Prisoner Literacy Act. The\ntest scores also qualified defendant to earn a GED (high school equivalency) certificate.\n        Defendant was paroled in 1998, but was reincarcerated on his conviction for the\n1999 three strikes offenses.\n        Thereafter, the record in defendant’s central file, or “C-file,” indicated many\ndisciplinary incidents.\n        On November 29, 2001, defendant was charged with a rules violation for failure to\ncomply with lockup procedures after meal time. Defendant pleaded not guilty, but was\nfound guilty of a rules violation. A few days later, December 3, 2001, defendant did not\ncome out of the housing unit for yard exercise time. Defendant became agitated and\nyelled at a corrections officer, threatening, “you better never come close to me.”\nDefendant was handcuffed and removed. Defendant was charged the next day with\nthreatening bodily harm to a peace officer. He pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty;\nthe offense was reduced and defendant was punished with forfeiture of credits. He was,\nhowever, placed in administrative segregation following the incident.\n        In 2002, defendant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge of “delaying lock-up,”\nwhen he refused to enter his cell at lockup. Defendant was disciplined with extra duty.\n        In 2004, defendant was found in possession of three gallons of “pruno,” one-half\ngallon of syrup, and one-half gallon of jelly. He was disciplined for possession of\nmanufactured alcohol. Defendant claimed he had only “juice” and “sugar,” “not pruno.”\n                                                                   [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                             10\n\f[footnote continued from previous page]\nNevertheless, he was found guilty and disciplined with forfeiture of credits and loss of\nprivileges.\n        In 2005, defendant was disciplined for an incident involving possession of\ncontraband. An inmate passed something under the door to defendant’s cell. The\nofficers shut down the water supply to both cells. The other inmate was searched. When\ndefendant was ordered to come out of his cell, he ran across the day room to another cell\nand slid something under the door. The officers sounded the alarm and ordered the\ninmates in the day room to get down. Defendant was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed.\nDefendant admitted that he had some lighters, but did not want to let the officers take\nthem from him. Defendant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge of resisting staff and\nusing force. He was counseled, reprimanded, and advised of requirements for his\nbehavior in the future.\n        In 2007, defendant and another inmate took part in a mutual combat on the\nbasketball court. Initially, neither defendant nor the other inmate complied with orders to\nlie down. Defendant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge, and was punished with the\nloss of 60 days of credits and 10 days’ loss of yard privileges.\n        In August 2009, defendant was the victim of a stabbing by another inmate.\nDefendant claimed that the incident was caused because a correctional officer falsely told\nsome inmates with gang affiliations that defendant was a “snitch” on inmates with cell\nphones, drugs, or other contraband. The attack happened when defendant was\nsurrounded by members of the Bloods gang and then stabbed. Defendant suffered cuts\non his head. In October 2009, defendant filed a grievance, requesting $200,000 in\ndamages for pain and suffering, and demanding an investigation into his charges that a\nguard had falsely portrayed him as a “snitch” to prison gang members. However,\ndefendant refused to identify any inmates whom he alleged had heard what the guard\nsaid, and defendant was unaware of any staff member who could corroborate the\nstatement. In the absence of any evidence and defendant’s lack of cooperation, no action\nwas taken on defendant’s grievance and complaint.\n        In January 2010, the institution’s classification committee adjusted defendant’s\nhousing classification, because he had not had any serious rules violations in the past six\nmonths. As a result of the adjustment, defendant could be placed in a two-person cell.\nAn “annual review” report of the same date (Jan. 13, 2010) indicated that, “no factors\nevident which would jeopardize safety or security of the institution.”\n        In November 2010, defendant was initially written up for “battery on a peace\nofficer,” when he allegedly pushed a correctional officer in the chest with his shoulder.\nThe offense was reduced below an “administrative” violation, however, and by a\nmemorandum in December 2010, the violation was ordered removed from defendant’s\nrecord, including removal of the referral and notice of rules violation. Evidently, the\ninstructions in the memorandum were not carried out, because papers referring to the\nviolation remained in defendant’s central file.\n                                                                [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                            11\n\f[footnote continued from previous page]\n        In March 2011, defendant’s housing assignment was reviewed by the institution’s\nclassification committee. Defendant was having a conflict with another inmate, and also\nwith one of the guards; defendant had been placed in the Administrative Segregation Unit\nand assigned to a different “special needs yard.” However, defendant was eventually\nreturned to his original special needs yard when the other inmate was transferred to a\ndifferent yard, and the officer no longer worked in the unit where defendant was housed.\n        In May 2011, defendant had a positive drug test. He pleaded not guilty to the rules\nviolation, but was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance. He was\ndisciplined with forfeiture of credits and loss of privileges.\n        In December 2011, defendant was written up twice for fighting with other inmates.\nOn December 10, 2011, defendant engaged in a mutual combat with another inmate on\nthe basketball court. Defendant denied punching anyone, but was found guilty of\nfighting and disciplined with forfeiture of credits and 30 days’ loss of yard privileges.\n        On December 26, 2011, defendant was fighting with a different inmate in the day\nroom. Defendant failed to comply with orders to get down, and even moved toward the\nother inmate as officers were approaching. Defendant was subdued with pepper spray.\nDefendant was again found guilty of fighting. He was reprimanded and counseled about\nexpectations for his future behavior.\n        In another notation in December 2011, defendant was identified as a member of\nthe Men’s Advisory Council, with some extended privileges to be out of his cell when on\ncouncil business.\n        One day in July 2012, defendant refused to go back to his cell after the morning\nmeal. Defendant complained that he had been asking to be moved away from his current\ncellmate. Defendant was reminded of the proper procedures to request a bed move. In\nAugust 2012, a memorandum was issued concerning the July incident; the disciplinary\noffense was reduced from “delaying an officer” to “misconduct,” and rated below the\n“administrative classification” level. The memorandum ordered the disciplinary report\nand other written reports to be removed from defendant’s central file.\n        In November 2012, defendant was found in possession of tobacco, a contraband\nsubstance in the facility. Defendant refused to attend the disciplinary hearing. A plea of\nnot guilty was entered for him in absentia, but defendant was found guilty of possession\nof contraband. He was disciplined with forfeiture of 60 days of credits, and with 90 days’\nloss of day room, telephone and yard privileges.\n        In December 2012, defendant was fighting with another inmate outside the\nculinary building. Neither inmate initially complied with orders to lie down. Both were\npepper-sprayed and taken into custody. Defendant refused to attend the disciplinary\nhearing. A not guilty plea was entered for him. At the hearing, defendant was found\nguilty of fighting and disciplined with forfeiture of 90 days of credits, and 30 days’ loss\nof day room, telephone, and yard privileges.\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fyears, defendant was involved in a fair number of disciplinary infractions, including a\n\nnumber of incidents of threats, forcible resistance, mutual combat with other inmates, and\n\nother flare-ups of violence, in addition to other rules violations.\n\n       Defendant testified at the hearing that he had been in only four mutual combat\n\nfights, all of which he claimed happened because he had renounced his former street gang\n\nmembership and had refused to participate in “prison politics.” Defendant said he has\n\nbeen in protective custody since 2009. Defendant told the court that he was sorry for his\n\npast crimes. He said, “I made childish, stupid decisions.” Defendant said that, if he\n\ncould apologize to his victims face to face, he would do so. On questioning by the court,\n\nhowever, defendant admitted that, in the several years following his crimes, he never\n\nthought of writing a letter to any of his victims. Defendant stated that he realized he had\n\n“screwed [his] life up” by choosing the wrong people to associate with, and engaging in\n\n“stupid” behaviors. Defendant said that he was a changed man, and that he was trying to\n\nobtain whatever education was available to him, and worked different prison jobs that\n\nwere offered. He had worked in both landscaping and culinary positions. Some positions\n\nor programs were unavailable to him because of his life sentence. Defendant admitted\n\nthat, when not imprisoned, he had never been employed, except for a short stint as a\n\nroofing trainee while he was living in a halfway house. The longest defendant had ever\n\nbeen out of custody was 15 to 16 months.\n\n       Some of defendant’s family members attended the hearing. Defendant’s aunt\n\ntestified about defendant’s difficult childhood and his removal from his mother’s custody\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fat an early age. Defendant’s home life was unstable and he went back and forth between\n\nvarious relatives from ages five to 16. The aunt stated that she could now provide him\n\nsome stability if he were released; she had not been able to be part of his life before,\n\nbecause she did not drive. She had talked to defendant by telephone about five or six\n\ntimes in the past five years.\n\n       Defendant’s uncle testified that he had spoken to defendant approximately 15\n\ntimes in the past five years. The uncle was unable to take defendant away from his\n\nenvironment when defendant was a teenager, because of time and distance constraints.\n\nDefendant was living and going to school in Los Angeles; the uncle and his family lived\n\nin Moreno Valley, so defendant’s commute to his vocational school would have been\n\ndifficult. The uncle had also then been preoccupied with his own children. The uncle felt\n\nthat, if defendant had been allowed to live with him earlier, defendant would not have\n\ngotten into trouble. The prosecutor pointed out, however, that defendant’s family\n\nmembers lied on the stand at the trial in defendant’s present commitment offense, in\n\nsupport of defendant’s claim at trial that he in fact did not possess or know about the gun\n\nin his girlfriend’s apartment.\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated: “You know, these cases are\n\nvery hard. . . . [¶] . . . [O]n a human level, it’s just very difficult. Nobody gives us a\n\ncrystal ball. Nobody tells us, well, is Mr. Dill going to go out and re-offend like [the\n\nprosecutor] says, or is he going to be law abiding like he says he’ll be?\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f       “I can only look at not the words, but the behavior. I can only look at not only\n\nyour history, . . . but how you have been going along. And I believe that a lot of your\n\nfights in prison may come from your trying to get out of the gang lifestyle. I can believe\n\nthat. But I don’t believe that you’ve really had any insight. I think you view yourself as\n\na victim. I think you view your family as a victim of your behavior.\n\n       “But when you, as a child, 16 is a child, you get eight years for a horrible crime,\n\nand [the California Youth Authority] isn’t a picnic . . . . You get out of there, you had a\n\nchance to do programming. You had a chance to do school, you’re in school. You have\n\na supportive family. One side is probably not functioning as well as it should, but there\n\nare people in your family who are functioning.\n\n       “You throw that away, and you do another two years as an adult, and then you\n\nthrow that away and you do another nine years as an adult. And out just a minute and\n\na half [sic], you’re back with a gun . . . . And you know enough to hide it. And then\n\nyou claim, ‘I was hanging out with that girl.’ We know that is not true. You knew\n\nenough to hide it in there. You knew enough to . . . tell the police you had it because you\n\nwere—then, same story you are giving me now—trying to stay away from those gangs.\n\n       “So, Mr. Dill, the bottom line is, as hard as it is, as much as I believe you talk\n\nthe talk, I don’t believe you have learned to walk the walk. And I know your family\n\nwants . . . to give you another chance, but I’m with [the prosecutor] on this one. I can’t\n\nsay to myself, even by a preponderance of the evidence, that I believe you’ll remain law\n\nabiding.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       “It’s so overwhelmingly difficult for you. You have little insight. You’re 43 years\n\nold. You have never worked a job . . . . You have never completed school, although you\n\ndid complete your GED your second stint in state prison which says you could do that.\n\n[¶] You have had opportunities to do right. You have had a family that would help you\n\ndo right and you chose not to. So I’m going to deny your petition. I’m sorry for your\n\nfamily because they’ve paid already all these years. But they don’t know you, they\n\ncouldn’t possibly know you. As supportive as they are, I don’t believe they would keep\n\nyou law abiding, they hadn’t before.”\n\n       Defendant seizes on some of these and others of the court’s remarks, arguing that\n\nthe court improperly placed a burden on defendant to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he would remain law abiding, rather than placing the burden on the\n\nprosecution to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there remained a substantial\n\nrisk of danger to the public if defendant were adjudged eligible for eventual release.\n\n       The entire context of the court’s remarks, in light of the evidence on the record,\n\nsupports the trial court’s denial of defendant’s petition.\n\n       Defendant’s juvenile adjudications and strike offenses involved weapons and\n\nthreats of violence in the commission of a number of robberies. Defendant failed at each\n\nopportunity in the past to learn from his mistakes. After each release from custody, he\n\nsoon reoffended in much the same way, acting in concert with others to rob while armed\n\nwith weapons. Defendant was an active participant in the latest strike offense, binding\n\nthe victims with duct tape, personally taking their jewelry from their persons, and\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fthreatening them. Defendant committed each new offense while he was on active parole\n\nfrom his previous offense. In the latest commitment offense, defendant still had not\n\nlearned his lesson: he armed himself with a gun.\n\n       Despite defendant’s claims that he got the gun for protection from other gang\n\nmembers, because he was leaving his former gang, he selected a violent means of\n\npotential “protection.” Defendant, as the court pointed out, knew enough to hide the gun,\n\nas he was well aware that he was not allowed to possess it. At the scene of the search,\n\ndefendant admitted to police that the gun was his. At the trial, however, defendant\n\nrecanted that stance, instead claiming that he knew nothing about the gun or its presence\n\nin the apartment; defendant accused the officers of lying about his statement. In support\n\nof the defense theory, defendant presented the testimony of “supportive” family\n\nmembers, i.e., false testimony to support defendant’s narrative that the police were lying.\n\nThat is, defendant’s father testified at the trial, claiming to have been in a position\n\nimmediately outside the apartment windows to observe the search and to hear the\n\nofficers’ conversation with defendant, so that he knew that defendant never stated that the\n\ngun was his. The father’s testimony was impeached; the officers testified that they\n\nestablished a perimeter around the building while the warrant search was conducted, so\n\nthat defendant’s father could not have been in a position to see and hear the matters he\n\nclaimed to have seen and heard. As the prosecutor expressed it at the resentencing\n\nhearing, “the whole case was basically Mr. Dill was framed by the police and we have his\n\nfamily here to support that claim.” Even at the hearing on the present petition to recall\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fthe sentence, defendant maintained that the gun was not his, and blamed his predicament\n\non being involved with the girlfriend: “I shouldn’t have been in that house. I was\n\nmessing with the girl. The girl was up in there, and I wasn’t trying to do anything with\n\nthat gun . . . . And maybe that is my mistake for messing with this girl at the wrong place\n\nat the wrong time. I wasn’t trying to have that gun or do anything.” On this occasion,\n\nhowever, defendant did at least admit that he knew the gun was in the apartment.\n\n       The court summarized the offense as follows: “[H]e had this strike and it was a\n\nreally bad offense and he got punished for it. What did he do after? He did it again. And\n\nhe did it again. And now, this case which makes him eligible, it’s not a violent crime,\n\nhe’s got a gun. He . . . tells the police the truth when he’s first caught. I think he tells\n\nthem the truth completely, ‘Yes, it’s my marijuana. Yes, it’s my gun. I had it for\n\nprotection from gangs. I know I shouldn’t have it, yes, it’s mine.’ That’s what he tells\n\nthe police. [¶] By the time he testifies, they’re liars. His family testifies they’re liars.\n\nAnd he never cops to it, even today, . . . when he has no reason to fabricate, none, zero,\n\nhe’s begging for his life. ‘That wasn’t my gun, your Honor. I knew it was up in the attic,\n\nbut that wasn’t mine. My only mistake is being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\n\nhanging out with this girl.’”\n\n       As to defendant’s prison conduct record, he had a few positive entries for\n\neducational achievement, all of which occurred before the present commitment offense.\n\nOtherwise, defendant still preferred to solve his problems with fisticuffs, including\n\nincidents that were relatively recent. Defendant had several violations based on\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fpossession of contraband substances, including possession of prison-made alcohol,\n\npossession of lighters, and possession of drugs. Defendant had several written\n\ndisciplinary infractions for failing to comply with officer directives, necessitating\n\ndeployment of pepper spray.\n\n       Defendant was apparently able to maintain his work assignment, even in the\n\nAdministrative Segregation Unit. He had one memorandum in his record reflecting that\n\nhe had behaved well enough on his special needs yard and in his restricted classification\n\nthat he could be housed in a two-person cell; he did not have a history of physical or\n\nsexual violence with roommates, either as a perpetrator or a victim, that would\n\ncompromise safety by assigning him to a two-person cell.\n\n       Defendant displayed remarkably little understanding of the consequences of his\n\nactions on his victims. He had done little or nothing to gain perspective, to improve\n\nhimself, to make amends for the wrongs he had done, or even to express minimal\n\nunderstanding of the harms he had caused. Defendant’s tearful emotions at the petition\n\nhearing were focused largely on the consequences to himself and his family members.\n\n       As stated in Kaulick: “Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (g), provides that\n\na trial court, in exercising its discretion on the issue of dangerousness, may consider the\n\nfollowing factors: (1) the petitioner’s criminal conviction history; (2) the petitioner’s\n\ndisciplinary record and record of rehabilitation; and (3) ‘[a]ny other evidence the court,\n\nwithin its discretion, determines to be relevant’ to the issue of dangerousness.” (People\n\nv. Superior Court (Kaulick), supra, 215 Cal. App. 4th 1279, 1297.) The record here was\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\freplete with many different kinds of incidents, both in defendant’s criminal record and in\n\nhis prison correctional central file, which indicated that defendant continued to pose an\n\nongoing substantial risk to public safety were he to be released. He had achieved very\n\nlittle in the way of documented efforts at rehabilitation. He continued to minimize his\n\nown misconduct and to blame others for his predicament. It simply cannot be said that\n\nthe trial court’s determination that defendant remained an unreasonable risk to public\n\nsafety was an arbitrary, whimsical or capricious conclusion. (See, e.g., People v.\n\nNocelotl (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1091, 1097 [trial court’s decision not to allow a\n\ndefendant to withdraw his plea for alleged mistake or misadvice by defense counsel was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion; the ruling was not “arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious,”\n\nbecause the defendant still received a benefit from the plea bargain, regardless of the\n\nmisadvice, and the defendant failed to allege in his motion to withdraw the plea that he\n\nwould not have agreed to the bargain in the absence of the mistake].)\n\n       We likewise reject defendant’s further claims that the trial court denied relief\n\nbased upon an arbitrary or irrational bias.3 Defendant claims that “[t]reating eligible\n\ndefendants differently based simply on the nature of their prior strikes was an arbitrary\n\nrationale for denying relief.” To the contrary, Penal Code section 1170.126 itself makes\n\n\n       3 Defendant refers to the trial court’s discussion of defendant’s strike priors as\ninvolving robbery and severe trauma to the victims, compared to “property” crimes that\ndid not “hurt people,” e.g., stealing from a store or stealing cars, or even residential\nburglaries, which are “very serious,” but which might not involve hurting people.\nDefendant insists that the court’s remarks betrayed a “somewhat shocking[]”\nmisunderstanding, whereas in fact, “[a]ll crime victims are traumatized.”\n\n\n                                             20\n\fdistinctions between defendants based on the “nature of their prior strikes.” Defendants\n\nwith certain prior strikes are statutorily ineligible even to be considered for resentencing.\n\nAs between three strikes defendants whose prior strike offenses do not automatically\n\nrender them ineligible for resentencing, the trial court is called upon, in the determination\n\nof dangerousness, to make precisely the distinction that defendant now complains of:\n\nwhich such eligible three strikes defendants remain a danger to public safety and which\n\ndo not?\n\n       As defendant states, there is likely some level of trauma or victimization in the\n\ncommission of almost any strike offense. However, it is no less true that the facts\n\napplicable to some criminal offenses will show them to be less traumatizing, and the\n\noffender perhaps less dangerous to public safety than the facts in other cases. The court’s\n\nremarks are reasonably interpreted, not as a blanket determination that all offenders who\n\ncommit property crimes are less dangerous than other offenders, but as a recognition that\n\nthe amount of trauma inflicted by offenders on their victims—regardless of or in addition\n\nto the type of crime—may be a valid consideration in assessing the continued\n\ndangerousness of an eligible three strikes defendant. Indeed, Penal Code section\n\n1170.126, subdivision (g)(1), expressly permits the trial court to consider: “The\n\npetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, [and] the\n\nextent of injury to victims . . . .” (Italics added.) Defendant’s contention that the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the type of crime he committed, or the trauma he inflicted on\n\nvictims, is somehow an illegitimate consideration is without merit.\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f       Defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that he had not done\n\nany “programming,” when in fact defendant testified that he had been participating in\n\nsuch programs as he could, given his housing status and custody status. Defendant told\n\nthe court that he had done landscaping and culinary jobs, and any other jobs for which he\n\nwas eligible. Despite disciplinary incidents on his record, he had not lost any jobs he had\n\nhad since 2004, and still had “A1-A status.” Defendant’s central file also contained a\n\nchart of defendant’s regular work hours for one month, in June of 2010. Defendant\n\ncontends the trial court “overlooked the proof of programming in the [central] file.”\n\nDefendant maintains that, although the central file may be “lacking in detail” concerning\n\ndefendant’s participation in prison programs, “[y]et that is not an excuse for the court to\n\ntotally overlook the scant records of [defendant’s] steady programming that [the\n\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation] included in the [central] file.” Defendant\n\nhas failed to show, however, that the trial court disregarded the evidence that defendant,\n\nand his central file, presented. Defendant was fully able to testify that he had worked\n\njobs for which he was eligible, and that he had never lost a job; jobs are lost for “program\n\nfailure,” but defendant maintained his eligibility for the jobs open to someone in close\n\ncustody.\n\n       The court’s concern, however, was whether there was anything in defendant’s\n\ncentral file showing that he had any positive achievements or referrals. Defendant did\n\ncomplete his GED in his 20’s, when he was incarcerated on an earlier offense before the\n\ncurrent conviction. Defendant was released after that earlier conviction, and then\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\freincarcerated for the present offense. Defendant is now in his 40’s, but had not done any\n\nfurther educational programs. He had never had a job outside of prison. He had\n\nremained free from custody at most for a period of 15 or 16 months since the age of 16.\n\nDefendant did receive some counseling, but he explained it was for treatment of\n\ndepression; defendant’s counseling had nothing to do with gaining insight into his past or\n\npresent criminal or other dysfunctional behaviors. Defendant had no entries in his record\n\ndemonstrating affirmative achievements in education, vocational training, or life skills,\n\nduring the 13 years of his latest incarceration. He had some periods of time when he\n\navoided disciplinary infractions, and he did some prison jobs within his eligibility.\n\nHowever, he also had a number of disciplinary incidents over the years, which showed\n\nthat he still resorted to violence to solve his problems. Although defendant claimed that\n\nhis fights arose from his renunciation of his gang membership, there was nothing in\n\ndefendant’s central file to corroborate this claim. Defendant also still had difficulty\n\nconforming his behavior to social requirements, and he still failed to accept responsibility\n\nfor his actions. The court could not “overlook” evidence of positive achievement and\n\nprogress that simply wasn’t there.\n\n       Defendant also contends that the trial court engaged in “unfounded speculation”\n\nabout defendant’s mental or psychological status, without having obtained expert\n\nevidence.4 Defendant concedes, however, that the court was not required to appoint an\n\n       4  Defendant points to the court’s musings that defendant may have been exposed\nto drugs in utero, and that he may have had neurological problems at birth. Although\ndefendant claimed at the hearing that he tried to understand the pain he had caused to his\n                                                                  [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                             23\n\fexpert to assist it in making the determination of dangerousness. (See People v. Stuckey\n\n(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 898, 917 [“‘Of course, the trial court is never obliged to appoint\n\nan expert to assist it in making a factual, much less a legal, determination under Evidence\n\nCode section 730 unless, as that section provides, “it appears to the court . . . that expert\n\nevidence is . . . required”’”].) The trial court’s references to “broken” brains or\n\npersonalities were simply colloquial expressions of a difference between dysfunctional\n\nbehaviors and thought processes, rather than ordinary mental mistakes or miscalculations.\n\nThe court was not making a medical or psychological diagnosis, as such, but simply\n\nnoting that defendant’s choices of coping mechanisms—denial, minimization, making\n\nexcuses, resorting to violence, choosing to harm others rather than delay his own desires\n\nand gratifications—had not served him well in the past, yet he continued to display the\n\nsame choices and mechanisms. Defendant’s preferences with respect to problem-solving\n\nhad hurt people in the past, had persisted into the present, and showed every sign of\n\ncontinuing into the future.\n\n\n\n\n[footnote continued from previous page]\nvictims, the court questioned whether defendant truly felt empathy for them, stating that\n“[s]ometimes people’s brains are broken.” Defendant attempted to minimize his conduct,\nclaiming he had made “stupid decisions.” His uncle wrote a letter to the court, stating\nthat defendant had “made mistakes” and “learned from his mistakes.” Defendant’s aunt\ntold the court that defendant’s crimes were “very hideous, but we all make mistakes,” and\nthat defendant was “immature” when he committed his crimes. The court remarked,\nhowever, that “Running a stop sign is a mistake. I’ll even give a first time 18-year-old’s\npetty theft is a mistake. Pointing weapons at people with other people and Duct taping\nthem in a closet or room and terrifying them so they think they’re going to die is not a\nmistake. It is a broken personality.”\n\n\n                                              24\n\f       Defendant urges that a preponderance of the evidence “did not prove [he] posed an\n\nunreasonable risk to public safety.” Our task on review is not to “prove” by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that defendant posed an unreasonable risk to public safety.\n\nRather, the question before us is whether substantial evidence supports the finding made\n\nby the trial court. Defendant consistently emphasizes the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to himself to argue that, despite defendant’s many rule violations, such\n\nmisconduct does not logically prove: (1) that defendant would engage in such behavior\n\n(such as possession of alcohol or tobacco, which are contraband in the prison setting)\n\noutside of prison; or (2) that, even if he did use alcohol or tobacco outside of prison, such\n\nconduct would prove risky to public safety; or (3) that defendant committed his crimes\n\ninfluenced by alcohol, tobacco, or any other drugs; or (4) even if defendant did break the\n\nlaw outside prison with respect to use of drugs or alcohol, “that does not logically lead to\n\na conclusion that he posed an unreasonable risk to public safety.”\n\n       These and other such arguments are beside the point. Defendant’s rule violations\n\ndemonstrate a disregard for conforming his behavior to the social requirements of his\n\nenvironment. Regardless of whether or not there is a “direct correlation” between the\n\nsubject of some of defendant’s prison disciplinary violations and the crimes he committed\n\nin the past, he has a demonstrated lack of ability to conform his conduct to society’s\n\nstandards. The evidence was more than ample to support a finding that defendant\n\ncontinued to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety should he be released from prison.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f                                      DISPOSITION\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s petition to recall\n\nhis three strikes sentence.

After passage of the Three Strikes Reform\n\nAct (Reform Act) in November 2012, defendant filed a petition to recall the sentence and\n\nfor resentencing pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.126. The trial court found\n\ndefendant eligible to apply for resentencing, but denied defendant’s petition on the\n\nmerits, finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to the public.\n\nDefendant appeals, contending that the trial court applied the wrong standard,\n\nmisallocated the burden of proof, considered improper matters, and otherwise abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his petition. We affirm.\n\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       When defendant was 16 years old, he was adjudicated a ward of the court for\n\nrobbery and aggravated assault when he participated with an armed accomplice in taking\n\njewelry by force from a victim in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Defendant was\n\nthen committed to the California Youth Authority (Youth Authority) for eight years, but\n\nwas released after three or four years when he was 20 years old.\n\n       In 1991, while defendant was still on parole after his release from the Youth\n\nAuthority, and before his 21st birthday, he committed another robbery. He and two\n\naccomplices robbed the clerk of a convenience store. One of the accomplices was armed\n\nwith a knife. Defendant was sentenced to prison for three years.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f          Defendant was on parole in 1993 when he entered a shoe store with two\n\naccomplices; one of the accomplices was armed with a gun. Defendant helped herd the\n\nstore employees into the back room. Defendant pushed one of the employees to the floor,\n\nand an accomplice threatened to kill the employees. Defendant assisted his companions\n\nby tying their hands with duct tape. Defendant and his accomplices emptied the cash\n\nregister, tripping a silent alarm. Responding officers arrested defendant and his\n\naccomplices. Defendant was again convicted of robbery, and a finding was made that a\n\nprincipal was armed with a firearm in the commission of the offense. Defendant was\n\nsentenced to nine years in prison.\n\n          These three robbery offenses were alleged as strikes in 1999, when defendant was\n\ncharged with new offenses. Defendant evidently had been paroled after his 1993 robbery\n\nconviction some time in 1998. In 1999, an incident occurred when a search warrant was\n\nexecuted while defendant was sitting in a car parked in front of his girlfriend’s apartment.\n\nDefendant was detained while the search was being carried out. Defendant at first denied\n\nliving in the apartment, but then admitted he stayed there sometimes. The searching\n\nofficers found a bag of cocaine under some rocks near the front door of the apartment,\n\nmore cocaine hidden in a bathroom vent, and some marijuana. They also found an\n\nunloaded handgun concealed in a sock and hidden in the attic crawl space in the bedroom\n\ncloset.\n\n          Defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, possession\n\nof cocaine base for sale, and possession of marijuana. Defendant pleaded guilty to the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fmisdemeanor charge of marijuana possession, and was tried on the remaining charges.\n\nThe information also alleged two strike priors and two prior prison terms.\n\n       Defendant’s girlfriend testified at trial that the cocaine base belonged to defendant,\n\nand that she had seen him selling cocaine outside the apartment. Defendant had told\n\npolice at first that he knew nothing about the cocaine. Later, defendant said that some of\n\nhis friends had sold cocaine, but he still denied personal participation. Some of the\n\nofficers testified that defendant admitted obtaining the gun for protection. Defendant’s\n\ngirlfriend testified at trial that defendant had brought the gun to the apartment, and he had\n\ntold his girlfriend that he got it for protection. Defendant denied making any such\n\nadmission, however, and claimed that he had never seen the gun before the officers found\n\nit on the night of the search. The jury acquitted defendant on the charge of possession of\n\ncocaine base for sale, but did convict him of unlawful possession of a firearm by an ex-\n\nfelon. The trial court found true the prison term and strike allegations. In August 2000,\n\nthe court sentenced defendant as a third striker to a term of 25 years to life for the\n\npossession of a firearm charge, plus two one-year terms for the prior prison term\n\nconvictions, for a total term of 27 years to life.\n\n       In November 2012, the electorate passed Proposition 36, the Reform Act. The\n\nReform Act permits certain persons sentenced as third strikers to petition for recall of the\n\nsentence and for resentencing as a second striker, when the third strike offense is not a\n\nserious or violent felony. (See Pen. Code, § 1170.126.) Defendant requested\n\nappointment of counsel to assist in filing a petition. A petition was duly filed on April\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f23, 2013. The People filed an opposition memorandum. The trial court heard\n\ndefendant’s petition on May 23, 2013. The court found that defendant was eligible for\n\nresentencing under the statute—i.e., he was not otherwise disqualified. The court denied\n\ndefendant’s petition, however, finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to the public were he to be released.\n\n       Defendant filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                  I. Standard of Review\n\n       The Reform Act amended the “Three Strikes” law to change the effect on\n\nsentencing if an offender’s third strike offense is not a serious or violent felony. Under\n\nthe former law, a recidivist offender who had two or more prior strikes, and who was\n\nconvicted of any new felony, was subject to an indeterminate life sentence. The Reform\n\nAct changed the Three Strikes law so that a life sentence for a third strike would be\n\nimposed only where the current offense is a serious or violent (strike) felony or where the\n\nprosecution has pled and proved an enumerated disqualifying factor. In all other cases,\n\nthe offender will now be sentenced as a second strike offender. (Pen. Code, §§ 667,\n\n1170.12.) The Reform Act also created a proceeding for postconviction relief for\n\nprisoners who are serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the Three\n\nStrikes law for a crime that was not a serious or violent felony and who are subject to\n\nother disqualifying factors. Once a prisoner has met the requirements for eligibility for\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fresentencing under Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e),1 then the prisoner\n\n“shall be resentenced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 and\n\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 unless the court, in its discretion,\n\ndetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (f), italics added.)\n\n       In exercising its discretion, “the court may consider:\n\n       “(1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\n\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\n\nthe remoteness of the crimes;\n\n       “(2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\n\nincarcerated; and\n\n\n\n\n       1  Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), provides: “(e) An inmate is\neligible for resentencing if:\n        “(1) The inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed\npursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section\n1170.12 for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or\nviolent felonies by subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.\n        “(2) The inmate’s current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses\nappearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.\n        “(3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses appearing in\nclause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\nclause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.”\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f        “(3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant\n\nin deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n\n        Review of the trial court’s ruling on the petition involves more than one issue. In\n\npart, we are called upon to determine the meaning of Penal Code section 1170.126,\n\nparticularly the provision that states: “the petitioner shall be resentenced . . . unless the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (f), italics\n\nadded.) We independently determine issues of law, such as the interpretation and\n\nconstruction of statutory language. (People v. Love (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252689\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252689/people-v-love/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284.)\n\nThe principles of statutory interpretation apply to voter initiatives, as well as to\n\nenactments of the legislature. (Ramos v. Superior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2292771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2292771/ramos-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n727.)\n\n        Beyond any issues of statutory interpretation, we are also called upon to review\n\nthe trial court’s discretionary ruling, finding that a new sentence would represent an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to the public. We review the trial court’s discretionary\n\nrulings for abuse of that discretion. When the standard of review is abuse of discretion,\n\nthe reviewing court “examines the ruling of the trial court and asks whether it exceeds the\n\nbounds of reason or is arbitrary, whimsical or capricious. [Citations.] This standard\n\ninvolves abundant deference to the trial court’s rulings.” (People v. Jackson (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1018.)\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fII. The Prosecution Bore the Burden of Establishing Dangerousness by a Preponderance\n\n                                       of the Evidence\n\n       In People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Kaulick), the\n\nCourt of Appeal described the three-step process for considering petitions for\n\nresentencing under Penal Code section 1170.126. “First, the court must determine\n\nwhether the prisoner is [statutorily] eligible for resentencing; second, the court must\n\ndetermine whether resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety; and third, if the prisoner is eligible and resentencing would not pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger, the court must actually resentence the prisoner.” (Kaulick,\n\nsupra, at p. 1299, italics omitted.)\n\n       The Kaulick court also took note of the express language of Penal Code section\n\n1170.126, subdivision (f), that an eligible petitioner “shall be resentenced” as a second\n\nstriker, “unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” The parties in Kaulick\n\nagreed, as do we, that this language places a burden of proof on the prosecution to\n\ndemonstrate dangerousness. The Kaulick court further held that the appropriate standard\n\nof proof was by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick),\n\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305.)\n\n       Defendant points to various remarks of the trial court, and suggests that the\n\nremarks indicate that the trial court misallocated the burden of proof at the hearing,\n\nrequiring defendant to demonstrate that he would not be dangerous, as opposed to the\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fprosecution’s burden to show that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of\n\ndangerousness to the public. That is, the court stated at one point that it could not find,\n\n“even by a preponderance of the evidence, that I believe you’ll remain law abiding.” At\n\nanother point, the court remarked that, even though defendant’s relatives were supportive,\n\n“I don’t believe they would keep you law abiding[;] they hadn’t before.”\n\n       These statements by the court did not, however, indicate that the court had\n\nallocated the burden of proof to defendant on the issue of dangerousness. From the\n\nbeginning, the trial court properly focused on the issue: “whether [defendant] remains a\n\ndanger to the community.” The court was entitled to, and did, consider many aspects of\n\ndefendant’s past criminal behavior, his convicted prior offenses, his current conviction,\n\nand his conduct while in prison in assessing the question of his future dangerousness.\n\nMany of these factors were troubling on the issue of the risk of danger to the public. The\n\ncourt’s statements simply expressed its assessment that it was more likely than not\n\n(preponderance standard) that defendant would continue to pose an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety.\n\n       The court is presumed to be aware of the applicable legal standards, and defendant\n\nhas failed to rebut that presumption. The totality of the circumstances shows that the trial\n\ncourt had the proper issue and the proper considerations before it: whether the\n\nprosecution had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fIII. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Defendant’s Resentencing\n\n                                           Petition\n\n       Defendant raises several evidentiary issues. Defendant contends that the trial\n\ncourt exhibited an arbitrary and irrational bias in some of its statements, that the court\n\nmisinterpreted the evidence, that the court engaged in speculation about defendant’s\n\npsychological status without expert evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n       In addition to defendant’s past criminal record, the trial court also received\n\nevidence of defendant’s activities and disciplinary record while in prison.2 Over the\n\n       2  On the positive side of the ledger, after being incarcerated on his third robbery\nconviction in 1993, defendant earned some academic certificates (reading competency,\nlanguage competency, and mathematics competency) in 1996. In 1997, he received a\nqualifying score on a test meeting the requirements of the Prisoner Literacy Act. The\ntest scores also qualified defendant to earn a GED (high school equivalency) certificate.\n        Defendant was paroled in 1998, but was reincarcerated on his conviction for the\n1999 three strikes offenses.\n        Thereafter, the record in defendant’s central file, or “C-file,” indicated many\ndisciplinary incidents.\n        On November 29, 2001, defendant was charged with a rules violation for failure to\ncomply with lockup procedures after meal time. Defendant pleaded not guilty, but was\nfound guilty of a rules violation. A few days later, December 3, 2001, defendant did not\ncome out of the housing unit for yard exercise time. Defendant became agitated and\nyelled at a corrections officer, threatening, “you better never come close to me.”\nDefendant was handcuffed and removed. Defendant was charged the next day with\nthreatening bodily harm to a peace officer. He pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty;\nthe offense was reduced and defendant was punished with forfeiture of credits. He was,\nhowever, placed in administrative segregation following the incident.\n        In 2002, defendant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge of “delaying lock-up,”\nwhen he refused to enter his cell at lockup. Defendant was disciplined with extra duty.\n        In 2004, defendant was found in possession of three gallons of “pruno,” one-half\ngallon of syrup, and one-half gallon of jelly. He was disciplined for possession of\nmanufactured alcohol. Defendant claimed he had only “juice” and “sugar,” “not pruno.”\n                                                                   [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                             10\n\f[footnote continued from previous page]\nNevertheless, he was found guilty and disciplined with forfeiture of credits and loss of\nprivileges.\n        In 2005, defendant was disciplined for an incident involving possession of\ncontraband. An inmate passed something under the door to defendant’s cell. The\nofficers shut down the water supply to both cells. The other inmate was searched. When\ndefendant was ordered to come out of his cell, he ran across the day room to another cell\nand slid something under the door. The officers sounded the alarm and ordered the\ninmates in the day room to get down. Defendant was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed.\nDefendant admitted that he had some lighters, but did not want to let the officers take\nthem from him. Defendant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge of resisting staff and\nusing force. He was counseled, reprimanded, and advised of requirements for his\nbehavior in the future.\n        In 2007, defendant and another inmate took part in a mutual combat on the\nbasketball court. Initially, neither defendant nor the other inmate complied with orders to\nlie down. Defendant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge, and was punished with the\nloss of 60 days of credits and 10 days’ loss of yard privileges.\n        In August 2009, defendant was the victim of a stabbing by another inmate.\nDefendant claimed that the incident was caused because a correctional officer falsely told\nsome inmates with gang affiliations that defendant was a “snitch” on inmates with cell\nphones, drugs, or other contraband. The attack happened when defendant was\nsurrounded by members of the Bloods gang and then stabbed. Defendant suffered cuts\non his head. In October 2009, defendant filed a grievance, requesting $200,000 in\ndamages for pain and suffering, and demanding an investigation into his charges that a\nguard had falsely portrayed him as a “snitch” to prison gang members. However,\ndefendant refused to identify any inmates whom he alleged had heard what the guard\nsaid, and defendant was unaware of any staff member who could corroborate the\nstatement. In the absence of any evidence and defendant’s lack of cooperation, no action\nwas taken on defendant’s grievance and complaint.\n        In January 2010, the institution’s classification committee adjusted defendant’s\nhousing classification, because he had not had any serious rules violations in the past six\nmonths. As a result of the adjustment, defendant could be placed in a two-person cell.\nAn “annual review” report of the same date (Jan. 13, 2010) indicated that, “no factors\nevident which would jeopardize safety or security of the institution.”\n        In November 2010, defendant was initially written up for “battery on a peace\nofficer,” when he allegedly pushed a correctional officer in the chest with his shoulder.\nThe offense was reduced below an “administrative” violation, however, and by a\nmemorandum in December 2010, the violation was ordered removed from defendant’s\nrecord, including removal of the referral and notice of rules violation. Evidently, the\ninstructions in the memorandum were not carried out, because papers referring to the\nviolation remained in defendant’s central file.\n                                                                [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                            11\n\f[footnote continued from previous page]\n        In March 2011, defendant’s housing assignment was reviewed by the institution’s\nclassification committee. Defendant was having a conflict with another inmate, and also\nwith one of the guards; defendant had been placed in the Administrative Segregation Unit\nand assigned to a different “special needs yard.” However, defendant was eventually\nreturned to his original special needs yard when the other inmate was transferred to a\ndifferent yard, and the officer no longer worked in the unit where defendant was housed.\n        In May 2011, defendant had a positive drug test. He pleaded not guilty to the rules\nviolation, but was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance. He was\ndisciplined with forfeiture of credits and loss of privileges.\n        In December 2011, defendant was written up twice for fighting with other inmates.\nOn December 10, 2011, defendant engaged in a mutual combat with another inmate on\nthe basketball court. Defendant denied punching anyone, but was found guilty of\nfighting and disciplined with forfeiture of credits and 30 days’ loss of yard privileges.\n        On December 26, 2011, defendant was fighting with a different inmate in the day\nroom. Defendant failed to comply with orders to get down, and even moved toward the\nother inmate as officers were approaching. Defendant was subdued with pepper spray.\nDefendant was again found guilty of fighting. He was reprimanded and counseled about\nexpectations for his future behavior.\n        In another notation in December 2011, defendant was identified as a member of\nthe Men’s Advisory Council, with some extended privileges to be out of his cell when on\ncouncil business.\n        One day in July 2012, defendant refused to go back to his cell after the morning\nmeal. Defendant complained that he had been asking to be moved away from his current\ncellmate. Defendant was reminded of the proper procedures to request a bed move. In\nAugust 2012, a memorandum was issued concerning the July incident; the disciplinary\noffense was reduced from “delaying an officer” to “misconduct,” and rated below the\n“administrative classification” level. The memorandum ordered the disciplinary report\nand other written reports to be removed from defendant’s central file.\n        In November 2012, defendant was found in possession of tobacco, a contraband\nsubstance in the facility. Defendant refused to attend the disciplinary hearing. A plea of\nnot guilty was entered for him in absentia, but defendant was found guilty of possession\nof contraband. He was disciplined with forfeiture of 60 days of credits, and with 90 days’\nloss of day room, telephone and yard privileges.\n        In December 2012, defendant was fighting with another inmate outside the\nculinary building. Neither inmate initially complied with orders to lie down. Both were\npepper-sprayed and taken into custody. Defendant refused to attend the disciplinary\nhearing. A not guilty plea was entered for him. At the hearing, defendant was found\nguilty of fighting and disciplined with forfeiture of 90 days of credits, and 30 days’ loss\nof day room, telephone, and yard privileges.\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fyears, defendant was involved in a fair number of disciplinary infractions, including a\n\nnumber of incidents of threats, forcible resistance, mutual combat with other inmates, and\n\nother flare-ups of violence, in addition to other rules violations.\n\n       Defendant testified at the hearing that he had been in only four mutual combat\n\nfights, all of which he claimed happened because he had renounced his former street gang\n\nmembership and had refused to participate in “prison politics.” Defendant said he has\n\nbeen in protective custody since 2009. Defendant told the court that he was sorry for his\n\npast crimes. He said, “I made childish, stupid decisions.” Defendant said that, if he\n\ncould apologize to his victims face to face, he would do so. On questioning by the court,\n\nhowever, defendant admitted that, in the several years following his crimes, he never\n\nthought of writing a letter to any of his victims. Defendant stated that he realized he had\n\n“screwed [his] life up” by choosing the wrong people to associate with, and engaging in\n\n“stupid” behaviors. Defendant said that he was a changed man, and that he was trying to\n\nobtain whatever education was available to him, and worked different prison jobs that\n\nwere offered. He had worked in both landscaping and culinary positions. Some positions\n\nor programs were unavailable to him because of his life sentence. Defendant admitted\n\nthat, when not imprisoned, he had never been employed, except for a short stint as a\n\nroofing trainee while he was living in a halfway house. The longest defendant had ever\n\nbeen out of custody was 15 to 16 months.\n\n       Some of defendant’s family members attended the hearing. Defendant’s aunt\n\ntestified about defendant’s difficult childhood and his removal from his mother’s custody\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fat an early age. Defendant’s home life was unstable and he went back and forth between\n\nvarious relatives from ages five to 16. The aunt stated that she could now provide him\n\nsome stability if he were released; she had not been able to be part of his life before,\n\nbecause she did not drive. She had talked to defendant by telephone about five or six\n\ntimes in the past five years.\n\n       Defendant’s uncle testified that he had spoken to defendant approximately 15\n\ntimes in the past five years. The uncle was unable to take defendant away from his\n\nenvironment when defendant was a teenager, because of time and distance constraints.\n\nDefendant was living and going to school in Los Angeles; the uncle and his family lived\n\nin Moreno Valley, so defendant’s commute to his vocational school would have been\n\ndifficult. The uncle had also then been preoccupied with his own children. The uncle felt\n\nthat, if defendant had been allowed to live with him earlier, defendant would not have\n\ngotten into trouble. The prosecutor pointed out, however, that defendant’s family\n\nmembers lied on the stand at the trial in defendant’s present commitment offense, in\n\nsupport of defendant’s claim at trial that he in fact did not possess or know about the gun\n\nin his girlfriend’s apartment.\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated: “You know, these cases are\n\nvery hard. . . . [¶] . . . [O]n a human level, it’s just very difficult. Nobody gives us a\n\ncrystal ball. Nobody tells us, well, is Mr. Dill going to go out and re-offend like [the\n\nprosecutor] says, or is he going to be law abiding like he says he’ll be?\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f       “I can only look at not the words, but the behavior. I can only look at not only\n\nyour history, . . . but how you have been going along. And I believe that a lot of your\n\nfights in prison may come from your trying to get out of the gang lifestyle. I can believe\n\nthat. But I don’t believe that you’ve really had any insight. I think you view yourself as\n\na victim. I think you view your family as a victim of your behavior.\n\n       “But when you, as a child, 16 is a child, you get eight years for a horrible crime,\n\nand [the California Youth Authority] isn’t a picnic . . . . You get out of there, you had a\n\nchance to do programming. You had a chance to do school, you’re in school. You have\n\na supportive family. One side is probably not functioning as well as it should, but there\n\nare people in your family who are functioning.\n\n       “You throw that away, and you do another two years as an adult, and then you\n\nthrow that away and you do another nine years as an adult. And out just a minute and\n\na half [sic], you’re back with a gun . . . . And you know enough to hide it. And then\n\nyou claim, ‘I was hanging out with that girl.’ We know that is not true. You knew\n\nenough to hide it in there. You knew enough to . . . tell the police you had it because you\n\nwere—then, same story you are giving me now—trying to stay away from those gangs.\n\n       “So, Mr. Dill, the bottom line is, as hard as it is, as much as I believe you talk\n\nthe talk, I don’t believe you have learned to walk the walk. And I know your family\n\nwants . . . to give you another chance, but I’m with [the prosecutor] on this one. I can’t\n\nsay to myself, even by a preponderance of the evidence, that I believe you’ll remain law\n\nabiding.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       “It’s so overwhelmingly difficult for you. You have little insight. You’re 43 years\n\nold. You have never worked a job . . . . You have never completed school, although you\n\ndid complete your GED your second stint in state prison which says you could do that.\n\n[¶] You have had opportunities to do right. You have had a family that would help you\n\ndo right and you chose not to. So I’m going to deny your petition. I’m sorry for your\n\nfamily because they’ve paid already all these years. But they don’t know you, they\n\ncouldn’t possibly know you. As supportive as they are, I don’t believe they would keep\n\nyou law abiding, they hadn’t before.”\n\n       Defendant seizes on some of these and others of the court’s remarks, arguing that\n\nthe court improperly placed a burden on defendant to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he would remain law abiding, rather than placing the burden on the\n\nprosecution to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there remained a substantial\n\nrisk of danger to the public if defendant were adjudged eligible for eventual release.\n\n       The entire context of the court’s remarks, in light of the evidence on the record,\n\nsupports the trial court’s denial of defendant’s petition.\n\n       Defendant’s juvenile adjudications and strike offenses involved weapons and\n\nthreats of violence in the commission of a number of robberies. Defendant failed at each\n\nopportunity in the past to learn from his mistakes. After each release from custody, he\n\nsoon reoffended in much the same way, acting in concert with others to rob while armed\n\nwith weapons. Defendant was an active participant in the latest strike offense, binding\n\nthe victims with duct tape, personally taking their jewelry from their persons, and\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fthreatening them. Defendant committed each new offense while he was on active parole\n\nfrom his previous offense. In the latest commitment offense, defendant still had not\n\nlearned his lesson: he armed himself with a gun.\n\n       Despite defendant’s claims that he got the gun for protection from other gang\n\nmembers, because he was leaving his former gang, he selected a violent means of\n\npotential “protection.” Defendant, as the court pointed out, knew enough to hide the gun,\n\nas he was well aware that he was not allowed to possess it. At the scene of the search,\n\ndefendant admitted to police that the gun was his. At the trial, however, defendant\n\nrecanted that stance, instead claiming that he knew nothing about the gun or its presence\n\nin the apartment; defendant accused the officers of lying about his statement. In support\n\nof the defense theory, defendant presented the testimony of “supportive” family\n\nmembers, i.e., false testimony to support defendant’s narrative that the police were lying.\n\nThat is, defendant’s father testified at the trial, claiming to have been in a position\n\nimmediately outside the apartment windows to observe the search and to hear the\n\nofficers’ conversation with defendant, so that he knew that defendant never stated that the\n\ngun was his. The father’s testimony was impeached; the officers testified that they\n\nestablished a perimeter around the building while the warrant search was conducted, so\n\nthat defendant’s father could not have been in a position to see and hear the matters he\n\nclaimed to have seen and heard. As the prosecutor expressed it at the resentencing\n\nhearing, “the whole case was basically Mr. Dill was framed by the police and we have his\n\nfamily here to support that claim.” Even at the hearing on the present petition to recall\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fthe sentence, defendant maintained that the gun was not his, and blamed his predicament\n\non being involved with the girlfriend: “I shouldn’t have been in that house. I was\n\nmessing with the girl. The girl was up in there, and I wasn’t trying to do anything with\n\nthat gun . . . . And maybe that is my mistake for messing with this girl at the wrong place\n\nat the wrong time. I wasn’t trying to have that gun or do anything.” On this occasion,\n\nhowever, defendant did at least admit that he knew the gun was in the apartment.\n\n       The court summarized the offense as follows: “[H]e had this strike and it was a\n\nreally bad offense and he got punished for it. What did he do after? He did it again. And\n\nhe did it again. And now, this case which makes him eligible, it’s not a violent crime,\n\nhe’s got a gun. He . . . tells the police the truth when he’s first caught. I think he tells\n\nthem the truth completely, ‘Yes, it’s my marijuana. Yes, it’s my gun. I had it for\n\nprotection from gangs. I know I shouldn’t have it, yes, it’s mine.’ That’s what he tells\n\nthe police. [¶] By the time he testifies, they’re liars. His family testifies they’re liars.\n\nAnd he never cops to it, even today, . . . when he has no reason to fabricate, none, zero,\n\nhe’s begging for his life. ‘That wasn’t my gun, your Honor. I knew it was up in the attic,\n\nbut that wasn’t mine. My only mistake is being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\n\nhanging out with this girl.’”\n\n       As to defendant’s prison conduct record, he had a few positive entries for\n\neducational achievement, all of which occurred before the present commitment offense.\n\nOtherwise, defendant still preferred to solve his problems with fisticuffs, including\n\nincidents that were relatively recent. Defendant had several violations based on\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fpossession of contraband substances, including possession of prison-made alcohol,\n\npossession of lighters, and possession of drugs. Defendant had several written\n\ndisciplinary infractions for failing to comply with officer directives, necessitating\n\ndeployment of pepper spray.\n\n       Defendant was apparently able to maintain his work assignment, even in the\n\nAdministrative Segregation Unit. He had one memorandum in his record reflecting that\n\nhe had behaved well enough on his special needs yard and in his restricted classification\n\nthat he could be housed in a two-person cell; he did not have a history of physical or\n\nsexual violence with roommates, either as a perpetrator or a victim, that would\n\ncompromise safety by assigning him to a two-person cell.\n\n       Defendant displayed remarkably little understanding of the consequences of his\n\nactions on his victims. He had done little or nothing to gain perspective, to improve\n\nhimself, to make amends for the wrongs he had done, or even to express minimal\n\nunderstanding of the harms he had caused. Defendant’s tearful emotions at the petition\n\nhearing were focused largely on the consequences to himself and his family members.\n\n       As stated in Kaulick: “Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (g), provides that\n\na trial court, in exercising its discretion on the issue of dangerousness, may consider the\n\nfollowing factors: (1) the petitioner’s criminal conviction history; (2) the petitioner’s\n\ndisciplinary record and record of rehabilitation; and (3) ‘[a]ny other evidence the court,\n\nwithin its discretion, determines to be relevant’ to the issue of dangerousness.” (People\n\nv. Superior Court (Kaulick), supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1297.) The record here was\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\freplete with many different kinds of incidents, both in defendant’s criminal record and in\n\nhis prison correctional central file, which indicated that defendant continued to pose an\n\nongoing substantial risk to public safety were he to be released. He had achieved very\n\nlittle in the way of documented efforts at rehabilitation. He continued to minimize his\n\nown misconduct and to blame others for his predicament. It simply cannot be said that\n\nthe trial court’s determination that defendant remained an unreasonable risk to public\n\nsafety was an arbitrary, whimsical or capricious conclusion. (See, e.g., People v.\n\nNocelotl (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1097 [trial court’s decision not to allow a\n\ndefendant to withdraw his plea for alleged mistake or misadvice by defense counsel was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion; the ruling was not “arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious,”\n\nbecause the defendant still received a benefit from the plea bargain, regardless of the\n\nmisadvice, and the defendant failed to allege in his motion to withdraw the plea that he\n\nwould not have agreed to the bargain in the absence of the mistake].)\n\n       We likewise reject defendant’s further claims that the trial court denied relief\n\nbased upon an arbitrary or irrational bias.3 Defendant claims that “[t]reating eligible\n\ndefendants differently based simply on the nature of their prior strikes was an arbitrary\n\nrationale for denying relief.” To the contrary, Penal Code section 1170.126 itself makes\n\n\n       3 Defendant refers to the trial court’s discussion of defendant’s strike priors as\ninvolving robbery and severe trauma to the victims, compared to “property” crimes that\ndid not “hurt people,” e.g., stealing from a store or stealing cars, or even residential\nburglaries, which are “very serious,” but which might not involve hurting people.\nDefendant insists that the court’s remarks betrayed a “somewhat shocking[]”\nmisunderstanding, whereas in fact, “[a]ll crime victims are traumatized.”\n\n\n                                             20\n\fdistinctions between defendants based on the “nature of their prior strikes.” Defendants\n\nwith certain prior strikes are statutorily ineligible even to be considered for resentencing.\n\nAs between three strikes defendants whose prior strike offenses do not automatically\n\nrender them ineligible for resentencing, the trial court is called upon, in the determination\n\nof dangerousness, to make precisely the distinction that defendant now complains of:\n\nwhich such eligible three strikes defendants remain a danger to public safety and which\n\ndo not?\n\n       As defendant states, there is likely some level of trauma or victimization in the\n\ncommission of almost any strike offense. However, it is no less true that the facts\n\napplicable to some criminal offenses will show them to be less traumatizing, and the\n\noffender perhaps less dangerous to public safety than the facts in other cases. The court’s\n\nremarks are reasonably interpreted, not as a blanket determination that all offenders who\n\ncommit property crimes are less dangerous than other offenders, but as a recognition that\n\nthe amount of trauma inflicted by offenders on their victims—regardless of or in addition\n\nto the type of crime—may be a valid consideration in assessing the continued\n\ndangerousness of an eligible three strikes defendant. Indeed, Penal Code section\n\n1170.126, subdivision (g)(1), expressly permits the trial court to consider: “The\n\npetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, [and] the\n\nextent of injury to victims . . . .” (Italics added.) Defendant’s contention that the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the type of crime he committed, or the trauma he inflicted on\n\nvictims, is somehow an illegitimate consideration is without merit.\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f       Defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that he had not done\n\nany “programming,” when in fact defendant testified that he had been participating in\n\nsuch programs as he could, given his housing status and custody status. Defendant told\n\nthe court that he had done landscaping and culinary jobs, and any other jobs for which he\n\nwas eligible. Despite disciplinary incidents on his record, he had not lost any jobs he had\n\nhad since 2004, and still had “A1-A status.” Defendant’s central file also contained a\n\nchart of defendant’s regular work hours for one month, in June of 2010. Defendant\n\ncontends the trial court “overlooked the proof of programming in the [central] file.”\n\nDefendant maintains that, although the central file may be “lacking in detail” concerning\n\ndefendant’s participation in prison programs, “[y]et that is not an excuse for the court to\n\ntotally overlook the scant records of [defendant’s] steady programming that [the\n\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation] included in the [central] file.” Defendant\n\nhas failed to show, however, that the trial court disregarded the evidence that defendant,\n\nand his central file, presented. Defendant was fully able to testify that he had worked\n\njobs for which he was eligible, and that he had never lost a job; jobs are lost for “program\n\nfailure,” but defendant maintained his eligibility for the jobs open to someone in close\n\ncustody.\n\n       The court’s concern, however, was whether there was anything in defendant’s\n\ncentral file showing that he had any positive achievements or referrals. Defendant did\n\ncomplete his GED in his 20’s, when he was incarcerated on an earlier offense before the\n\ncurrent conviction. Defendant was released after that earlier conviction, and then\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\freincarcerated for the present offense. Defendant is now in his 40’s, but had not done any\n\nfurther educational programs. He had never had a job outside of prison. He had\n\nremained free from custody at most for a period of 15 or 16 months since the age of 16.\n\nDefendant did receive some counseling, but he explained it was for treatment of\n\ndepression; defendant’s counseling had nothing to do with gaining insight into his past or\n\npresent criminal or other dysfunctional behaviors. Defendant had no entries in his record\n\ndemonstrating affirmative achievements in education, vocational training, or life skills,\n\nduring the 13 years of his latest incarceration. He had some periods of time when he\n\navoided disciplinary infractions, and he did some prison jobs within his eligibility.\n\nHowever, he also had a number of disciplinary incidents over the years, which showed\n\nthat he still resorted to violence to solve his problems. Although defendant claimed that\n\nhis fights arose from his renunciation of his gang membership, there was nothing in\n\ndefendant’s central file to corroborate this claim. Defendant also still had difficulty\n\nconforming his behavior to social requirements, and he still failed to accept responsibility\n\nfor his actions. The court could not “overlook” evidence of positive achievement and\n\nprogress that simply wasn’t there.\n\n       Defendant also contends that the trial court engaged in “unfounded speculation”\n\nabout defendant’s mental or psychological status, without having obtained expert\n\nevidence.4 Defendant concedes, however, that the court was not required to appoint an\n\n       4  Defendant points to the court’s musings that defendant may have been exposed\nto drugs in utero, and that he may have had neurological problems at birth. Although\ndefendant claimed at the hearing that he tried to understand the pain he had caused to his\n                                                                  [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                             23\n\fexpert to assist it in making the determination of dangerousness.

The trial court’s references to “broken” brains or\n\npersonalities were simply colloquial expressions of a difference between dysfunctional\n\nbehaviors and thought processes, rather than ordinary mental mistakes or miscalculations.\n\nThe court was not making a medical or psychological diagnosis, as such, but simply\n\nnoting that defendant’s choices of coping mechanisms—denial, minimization, making\n\nexcuses, resorting to violence, choosing to harm others rather than delay his own desires\n\nand gratifications—had not served him well in the past, yet he continued to display the\n\nsame choices and mechanisms. Defendant’s preferences with respect to problem-solving\n\nhad hurt people in the past, had persisted into the present, and showed every sign of\n\ncontinuing into the future.\n\n\n\n\n[footnote continued from previous page]\nvictims, the court questioned whether defendant truly felt empathy for them, stating that\n“[s]ometimes people’s brains are broken.” Defendant attempted to minimize his conduct,\nclaiming he had made “stupid decisions.” His uncle wrote a letter to the court, stating\nthat defendant had “made mistakes” and “learned from his mistakes.” Defendant’s aunt\ntold the court that defendant’s crimes were “very hideous, but we all make mistakes,” and\nthat defendant was “immature” when he committed his crimes. The court remarked,\nhowever, that “Running a stop sign is a mistake. I’ll even give a first time 18-year-old’s\npetty theft is a mistake. Pointing weapons at people with other people and Duct taping\nthem in a closet or room and terrifying them so they think they’re going to die is not a\nmistake. It is a broken personality.”\n\n\n                                              24\n\f       Defendant urges that a preponderance of the evidence “did not prove [he] posed an\n\nunreasonable risk to public safety.” Our task on review is not to “prove” by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that defendant posed an unreasonable risk to public safety.\n\nRather, the question before us is whether substantial evidence supports the finding made\n\nby the trial court. Defendant consistently emphasizes the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to himself to argue that, despite defendant’s many rule violations, such\n\nmisconduct does not logically prove: (1) that defendant would engage in such behavior\n\n(such as possession of alcohol or tobacco, which are contraband in the prison setting)\n\noutside of prison; or (2) that, even if he did use alcohol or tobacco outside of prison, such\n\nconduct would prove risky to public safety; or (3) that defendant committed his crimes\n\ninfluenced by alcohol, tobacco, or any other drugs; or (4) even if defendant did break the\n\nlaw outside prison with respect to use of drugs or alcohol, “that does not logically lead to\n\na conclusion that he posed an unreasonable risk to public safety.”\n\n       These and other such arguments are beside the point. Defendant’s rule violations\n\ndemonstrate a disregard for conforming his behavior to the social requirements of his\n\nenvironment. Regardless of whether or not there is a “direct correlation” between the\n\nsubject of some of defendant’s prison disciplinary violations and the crimes he committed\n\nin the past, he has a demonstrated lack of ability to conform his conduct to society’s\n\nstandards. The evidence was more than ample to support a finding that defendant\n\ncontinued to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety should he be released from prison.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f                                      DISPOSITION\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s petition to recall\n\nhis three strikes sentence.
