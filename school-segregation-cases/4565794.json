ERCOT manages about 90% of the state’s electric load, supplying power to some 24 million Texas\ncustomers. Outside ERCOT, Texas retail customers are served by cooperatives or vertically integrated investor-owned\nelectric utilities subject to regulation; the Public Utility Commission has not certified that any of those areas have met\nPURA’s competitive critieria.

As the case comes to us, only three issues remain. We hold that:\n\n•         PURA Section 36.351,7 which requires electric utilities to discount charges for service\n          provided to state college and university facilities, does not apply to TDUs because they\n          provide service to REPs, not to the REPs’ customers;\n\n•         former PURA Section 36.060(a),8 which required an electric utility’s income taxes to be\n          computed as though it had filed a consolidated return with a group of its affiliates eligible\n\n\n         2\n              T EX .

Its 14,600 miles of transmission lines and 102,000 miles of distribution lines\n\ncover 53,300 square miles and reach 7 million consumers in 401 cities and 91 counties within\n\nERCOT. Before deregulation, Oncor’s system was part of TXU Electric Co., an integrated utility.\n\n       Oncor is regulated by the PUC. In June 2008, Oncor initiated a ratemaking proceeding with\n\nthe Commission, its first request for a comprehensive rate increase since deregulation. Oncor\n\nrequested a $253 million increase because of the large investment it had made in its system, its\n\nmounting operations costs, and its anticipated need to make capital expenditures. Several parties\n\nintervened. After extensive hearings, the administrative law judges recommended only a $30 million\n\nrate increase. The PUC ultimately approved a $115 million increase.\n\n       Oncor and other parties to the administrative proceeding sued for judicial review and then\n\nappealed to the court of appeals. The disputes have been winnowed to three, and we limit our\n\ndiscussion to them. The PUC concluded that:\n\n       9\n           T EX . U TIL .

The court of\n\nappeals agreed with the PUC on the discount and franchise fee issues but not on the tax issue.11\n\n         Three petitions for review were filed with this Court:\n\n•        The State of Texas, which has universities in Oncor’s service areas, seeks review of the\n         appellate court’s resolution of the discount issue. The State’s petition is opposed by Oncor,\n         the PUC, and CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, another TDU. Eight state\n         universities in CenterPoint’s service area filed an amicus brief in support of the State’s\n         petition.12 We refer to the State and its amici as “State Universities”.13\n\n\n\n\n         11\n              Id. at 662, 630–631, 654, 659, 665.\n\n         12\n           Amici curiae are the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center at Houston, the University of Texas\nHealth Science Center at Houston, the University of Texas M edical Branch at Galveston, the University of Houston\nSystem, Texas A&M University at Galveston, Texas A&M Health Science Center-Institute of Biosciences &\nTechnology, Texas Engineering Extension Service at Galveston, and Prairie View A&M Nursing School.\n\n         13\n             The governments of the State are unusually divided in this case. The State sued for judicial review in the trial\ncourt in its own name, asserting the consumer interest of its institutions of higher education in the statutory discount. The\nState also has an interest in utility ratemaking through its agency, the PUC, which concluded that Oncor is not required\nto apply the discount to its rates. The State and the PUC, with their conflicting positions, are both represented by the\nAttorney General. The State has since adopted the alias, “State of Texas Agencies and Institutions of Higher Education”,\nshortened to “State Agencies”, apparently to more clearly distinguish between the State’s conflicting interests as both\nconsumer and regulator. But that agnomen suggests that state agencies other than educational institutions have an interest\nin the discount, which, as we explain below, is incorrect. Nor is the State’s consumer interest different from the interest\nof the amici State Universities. W e think the State and its amici are more clearly designated “State Universities”, by\nwhich we mean all entities claiming the statutory discount.\n\n                                                             4\n\f•         Oncor seeks review of the appellate court’s resolution of the tax issue. Oncor’s petition is\n          opposed by the Office of Public Utility Counsel (OPUC);14 municipalities within Oncor’s\n          service area, which refer to themselves as “The Steering Committee of Cities Served by\n          Oncor” (“Cities”); and the Texas Industrial Energy Consumers (TIEC).\n\n•         Oncor and Cities seek review of the appellate court’s resolution of the franchise fee issue.\n          Their petition is opposed by the PUC.\n\nThe issues, rulings, and parties’ positions are summarized in this scorecard:\n\n                               Issue                             PUC      TC      CA        PFR        Respondent\n    Must Oncor discount its rates to state                        No      Yes      No     State        Oncor\n    universities?

In 1999, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 720 “to establish\n\ncompetition in the retail market for electricity beginning January 1, 2002, and ‘to protect the public\n\ninterest during the transition’ to competition.”21 Senate Bill 7 unbundled vertically integrated utilities\n\nin ERCOT, mandating that each electric utility separate its business activities into a power\n\ngeneration company, an REP, and a TDU.22 The statute deregulated power generation companies and\n\nREPs, creating “a competitive retail electric market that allows each retail consumer to choose the\n\ncustomer’s provider of electricity”.23 But TDUs remained fully regulated by the PUC.24 Under\n\n\n          17\n               T EX .

Concluding that\n\nSection 36.351 is ambiguous, the court of appeals deferred to the PUC’s interpretation.28\n\n         We do not agree that Section 36.351 is ambiguous. PURA is quite clear: in deregulated areas\n\nof the state, a TDU “may not sell electricity”;29 only REPs can.30 TDUs cannot charge consumers for\n\nelectric service; TDUs charge wholesale tariffed rates set by the PUC to REPs, who in turn charge\n\ncustomers negotiated, competitive retail rates. It follows that TDUs cannot discount rates to\n\nconsumers but only to REPs. But Section 36.351 does not require a discount to REPs. The State\n\nUniversities acknowledge that an REP may not have a legal obligation to pass along a TDU’s\n\ndiscount to consumers but stress that as a practical matter, universities negotiate with REPs for a\n\nstraight pass-through of the TDU charges without any mark-up. The point remains that if universities\n\ncontinue to receive a discount, it is because of negotiation, not because of Section 36.351.

The State Universities argue that TDUs’\n\ntransmission and distribution of electricity to consumers’ service meters is a provision of electric\n\nservice to consumers’ facilities under Section 36.351 because TDUs’ lines connect to meters\n\ninstalled and maintained by TDUs at each retail consumer’s facilities. But while TDUs do provide\n\nelectric service31 —the physical delivery of electricity to consumers’ premises—they provide this\n\nservice to REPs. Only REPs can access the electricity delivered by TDUs. Consumers obtain\n\nelectricity through the service provided by REPs.\n\n         The State Universities argue that to interpret Section 36.351 as not applying to TDUs in\n\nderegulated areas produces an absurd result: a state university facility in a regulated area of the state\n\n—outside ERCOT, where vertically integrated electric utilities still exist and are subject to Section\n\n36.351—would be entitled to a discount, while a facility in ERCOT would not be. The University\n\nof Texas at El Paso would receive the discount; the University of Texas at Arlington would not. But\n\nwe agree with Oncor and the PUC that leaving any discount to negotiation is consistent with the\n\ncompetitive market under deregulation.\n\n         The PUC argues that the Legislature recognized the Section 36.351 discount would not\n\nsurvive deregulation and enacted Section 63 of Senate Bill 7 to extend its effect while the market\n\ntransitioned to competition. The State Universities counter that Section 63 froze the total rates paid\n\n         31\n              Id. § 11.003(19) (“‘Service’ has its broadest and most inclusive meaning. The term includes any act\nperformed, anything supplied, and any facilities used or supplied by a public utility in the performance of the utility’s\nduties . . . to its patrons, employees, other public utilities, an electric cooperative, and the public.”).\n\n                                                           9\n\fby state universities, not merely the discount. But the discount was included in the frozen rates.\n\nSection 63 preserved the discount while capping total rates. Indeed, Section 63 repeatedly referenced\n\nSection 36.351. We think the PUC has the better of the argument.32\n\n         Finally, the State Universities point to PURA Section 36.354 as evidence that Section 36.351\n\napplies to TDUs. Section 36.354 requires electric utilities to discount rates to military bases but only\n\n“in an area where customer choice is not available.”33 Thus, the statute does not apply to TDUs. The\n\nState Universities argue that when the Legislature wanted to exclude TDUs from a discount\n\nprovision, it did so explicitly, and no corresponding language appears in Section 36.351. But in\n\n1995, when Section 36.351 was enacted, it was clearly intended to apply to integrated utilities,\n\nincluding their transmission and distribution operations. Senate Bill 7’s change in the definition of\n\n“electric utility” made Section 36.351, as we have interpreted the provision, inapplicable to TDUs\n\nbut for Section 63, which expired by its own terms in 2007. No change in Section 36.351’s text was\n\nneeded to remove its application to TDUs. Section 36.354 was not enacted until 2003.34 At that\n\npoint, the limitation of its application to areas outside ERCOT, still under regulation, was perfectly\n\nconsistent with Section 36.351.\n\n\n\n         32\n            The State Universities argue that the PUC’s current position is inconsistent with its determination in a 2001\nratemaking case that the TDU was required to discount its rates under Section 36.351.

Oncor, because it was wholly owned by EFH, was deemed a\n\n“disregarded” entity and treated as a division of EFH under federal tax law.44 Had Oncor filed\n\nseparately, its tax liability would have been $151 million, but EFH’s affiliated group shared\n\n         41\n            Act of May 8, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 166, § 1, 1997 Tex.

In October 2007, Oncor became a Delaware limited\nliability corporation.\n\n         44\n            See 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701-2(a) (“A business entity with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is\ndisregarded; if the entity is disregarded, its activities are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or\ndivision of the owner.”).\n\n                                                             12\n\foperating losses and, as a result, paid no taxes.45 Using 2007 as the test year, and applying Section\n\n36.060(a), Oncor’s projected tax expense was much lower.\n\n         But in November 2008, while this proceeding was still pending in the PUC, EFH sold a\n\n19.96% interest in Oncor to two international investors. At that point, Oncor was a “partnership” for\n\nfederal tax purposes,46 and, because it no longer had a single owner, could not be “‘disregarded’ as\n\nan entity separate from its owner.”47 Federal tax law permitted Oncor to elect to be treated as a\n\ncorporation,48 which would have allowed Oncor to be included in the affiliated group eligible for\n\nEFH’s consolidated tax return.49 But Oncor did not make that election, and so by default it would\n\n\n\n\n         45\n             Oncor did pay EFH $151 million under their tax-sharing agreement, which called for a consolidated federal\nincome tax filing for all EFH’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but specifically “segregated or ring-fenced” Oncor from the\ntax liabilities or benefits of EFH’s affiliates. The agreement provided that, beginning January 1, 2007, Oncor’s income\ntax liability would be calculated and paid on a stand-alone basis as if Oncor were a corporation unrelated to EFH and\nits affiliates. This agreement, of course, does not control the application of Section 36.060.\n\n         46\n             See 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701-2(c)(1) (“For federal tax purposes . . .

EFH included its income as a partner in Oncor in its consolidated\n\ntax return, offset this income with other losses, and realized the same sort of tax savings as before.\n\n        The PUC determined that:\n\n•       Oncor’s tax expense should not be based on 2007 but on its situation after November 2008;\n\n•       after November 2008, Oncor was no longer a member of a group eligible to file a\n        consolidated tax return within the meaning of Section 36.060(a), and therefore that statute\n        did not require calculating its tax return as though it were still included in EFH’s\n        consolidated tax return; and\n\n•       although Oncor would be taxed as a partnership, its tax expense should be calculated as if\n        it were a stand-alone corporation.\n\nThe court of appeals held that because Oncor could have elected to be taxed as a corporation, and\n\nthere was no impediment to its doing so, it remained a member of an affiliated group eligible to file\n\na consolidated tax return.51 Therefore, the court concluded, the PUC should have used the 2007 test\n\nyear and applied Section 34.060(a).52\n\n        We disagree. Section 36.060(a) very plainly applies only to a utility that “is” a member of\n\nan affiliated group eligible to file a consolidated tax return, not a utility that could be. The court of\n\nappeals was troubled that Oncor could use its change of ownership and federal tax law to give EFH\n\nthe savings ratepayers had received when Oncor was included, as a “disregarded” entity, on EFH’s\n\nconsolidated tax return. But that concern cannot be used to read Section 36.060(a) contrary to its\n\n\n        50\n             See id. §§ 1501, 1504.\n\n       51\n             450 S.W .3d 615, 654 (Tex.

TIEC argues that the statute should apply because Oncor was “eligible” to be part of a\n\ngroup filing a consolidated tax return. But that misreads the provision. It is the group that must be\n\neligible to file a consolidated return, not the utility. The utility must be a member of an eligible\n\ngroup, and after November 2008, Oncor was not.53\n\n         The developments of November 2008 were “known and measurable changes” the PUC was\n\nrequired to take into account,54 and it correctly interpreted Section 36.060(a). OPUC, Cities, and\n\nTIEC nevertheless argue that the PUC erred in calculating Oncor’s tax expense as if it were a\n\ncorporation when it is taxed as a partnership—that is, its income is passed through to its owners, who\n\nbear the tax. For that reason, they insist, Oncor’s tax expense is minimal. We rejected this argument\n\nin Suburban Utility Corp. v. Public Utility Commission of Texas.55 There, we held that a utility\n\nstructured as a Subchapter S corporation could include, as reasonable and necessary expenses in a\n\nratemaking proceeding, the income taxes paid by its shareholders on the utility’s taxable income.56\n\nCiting precedent from the Commission, we explained that income taxes paid by shareholders of a\n\npass-through entity “are inescapable business outlays and are directly comparable with similar\n\ncorporate taxes which would have been imposed if the utility operations had been carried on by a\n\ncorporation.”57 Fairness “entitled” the owner of a pass-through entity “to a reasonable cost of service\n\n\n         53\n              Section 36.060 has been changed, and how it would now apply is not an issue in the case.\n\n         54\n             See 16 T EX .

PURA\n\nstates that it “does not restrict the rights and powers of a municipality to grant or refuse a franchise\n\nto use the streets and alleys in the municipality or to make a statutory charge for that use.”60 But\n\nSenate Bill 7 added PURA Section 33.008, which addresses franchise charges.

A municipality may not impose\n         a charge on:\n\n\n\n                                                            16\n\f•       Subsection (b) allows a municipality that imposed franchise charges before competition to\n        continue to charge per kilowatt hour of electricity delivered within the municipality the\n        average such charge imposed in 1998.62\n\n•       Subsection (c) provides that such charges are reasonable and necessary operating expenses\n        of the utility and may be passed on to REPs.63\n\n\n                  (1) an electric utility, or transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or\n        electric cooperative for electric service provided outside the municipality;\n                  (2) a qualifying facility;\n                  (3) an exempt wholesale generator;\n                  (4) a power marketer;\n                  (5) a retail electric provider;\n                  (6) a power generation company;\n                  (7) a person that generates electricity on and after January 1, 2002; or\n                  (8) an aggregator, as that term is defined by Section 39.353.\n\nThe “freeze period” ended when competition began. Id. § 31.002(8) (“‘Freeze period’ means the period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 1999, and ending on December 31, 2001.”).\n\n        62\n             Section 33.008(b) states:\n\n                  If a municipality collected a charge or fee for a franchise to use a municipal street, alley, or\n        public way from an electric utility, a municipally owned utility, or an electric cooperative before the\n        end of the freeze period, the municipality, after the end of the freeze period or after implementation\n        of customer choice by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative, as appropriate, is entitled\n        to collect from each electric utility, transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility,\n        or electric cooperative that uses the municipality’s streets, alleys, or public ways to provide\n        distribution service a charge based on each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by the utility to each\n        retail customer whose consuming facility’s point of delivery is located within the municipality’s\n        boundaries. The charge imposed shall be equal to the total electric franchise fee revenue due the\n        municipality from electric utilities, municipally owned utilities, or electric cooperatives, as\n        appropriate, for calendar year 1998 divided by the total kilowatt hours delivered during 1998 by the\n        applicable electric utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative to retail customers whose\n        consuming facilities’ points of delivery were located within the municipality’s boundaries. The\n        compensation a municipality may collect from each electric utility, transmission and distribution\n        utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative providing distribution service shall be equal\n        to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for 1998 multiplied times the number of kilowatt hours\n        delivered within the municipality’s boundaries.\n\n        63\n             Section 33.008(c) states:\n\n                 The municipal franchise charges authorized by this section shall be considered a reasonable\n        and necessary operating expense of each electric utility, transmission and distribution utility,\n        municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that is subject to a charge under this section. The\n        charge shall be included in the nonbypassable delivery charges that a customer’s retail electric\n        provider must pay under Section 39.107 to the utility serving the customer.\n\n                                                           17\n\f•      Subsection (f) states:\n\n               Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on the expiration of a\n       franchise agreement existing on September 1, 1999, an electric utility, transmission\n       and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative and a\n       municipality may mutually agree to a different level of compensation or to a different\n       method for determining the amount the municipality may charge for the use of a\n       municipal street, alley, or public way in connection with the delivery of electricity at\n       retail within the municipality.64\n\nSection 62(a) of Senate Bill 7 added: “Nothing in this Act shall restrict or limit a municipality’s\n\nhistorical right to control and receive reasonable compensation for use of public streets, alleys,\n\nrights-of-way, or other public property to convey or provide electricity.”\n\n       In its application to the PUC, Oncor proposed to include $253,884,976 of municipal franchise\n\ncharges as a reasonable and necessary operating expense. Of this amount, almost $5.7 million was\n\na 5% increase recently negotiated between Oncor and Cities. The PUC rejected Oncor’s request,\n\nconcluding that a utility cannot pay more than the charge set out in Section 33.008(b). In the court\n\nof appeals, the PUC abandoned that position, which is directly contradicted by Section 33.008(f)’s\n\nphrase, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision”. Instead, the PUC argued, citing the language in\n\nsubsection (f), that Oncor could include in its expenses a charge described in Section 33.008(f) only\n\nif it proved that the charge was agreed to “on the expiration of a franchise agreement existing on\n\nSeptember 1, 1999”.65 The PUC argued that Oncor failed to meet its burden of proof because there\n\nwas less than a scintilla of evidence that Oncor had agreements with the Cities before September 1,\n\n\n\n\n       64\n            Id. § 33.008(f).\n\n       65\n            450 S.W .3d 615, 658–659 (Tex. App.— Austin 2014).\n\n                                                      18\n\fand that these agreements expired thereafter. The court of appeals agreed.66\n\n       But the expiration of a franchise agreement existing on September 1, 1999, cannot be read\n\nas a condition to agreeing to a different charge. If it were, a municipality that had no franchise\n\nagreement with a TDU on that date could never impose a franchise charge in the future. A\n\nmunicipality with a franchise agreement in effect on that date could renegotiate it only once and\n\nnever again afterward. These restrictions would severely limit “a municipality’s historical right to\n\ncontrol and receive reasonable compensation” for the use of public property, in direct contradiction\n\nof Section 62(a) of Senate Bill 7.\n\n       Section 33.008(f) does not restrict renegotiated franchise charges to only those agreed to on\n\nthe expiration of franchise agreements existing on September 1, 1999. The provision simply\n\nprecludes the inference that Section 33.008(b) is exclusive. Reading the paragraphs of Section\n\n33.008 together, as we must, they confirm that municipalities may continue to impose franchise\n\ncharges after competition, that charges per kilowatt hour equal to the average amount charged in\n\n1998 must be considered reasonable and necessary, and that utilities may continue to renegotiate\n\nfranchise charges, though they must demonstrate that the charges are reasonable and necessary in\n\norder to pass them along to REPs.\n\n       The court of appeals misinterpreted Section 33.008(f). The PUC’s disallowance of Oncor’s\n\nrenegotiated franchise charges was error.\n\n\n\n\n       66\n            Id.\n\n                                                19\n\f                                  *      *       *       *       *\n\n       Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and\n\nthe case is remanded to the PUC for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Nathan L.

ERCOT manages about 90% of the state’s electric load, supplying power to some 24 million Texas\ncustomers. Outside ERCOT, Texas retail customers are served by cooperatives or vertically integrated investor-owned\nelectric utilities subject to regulation; the Public Utility Commission has not certified that any of those areas have met\nPURA’s competitive critieria.

Its 14,600 miles of transmission lines and 102,000 miles of distribution lines\n\ncover 53,300 square miles and reach 7 million consumers in 401 cities and 91 counties within\n\nERCOT. Before deregulation, Oncor’s system was part of TXU Electric Co., an integrated utility.\n\n       Oncor is regulated by the PUC. In June 2008, Oncor initiated a ratemaking proceeding with\n\nthe Commission, its first request for a comprehensive rate increase since deregulation. Oncor\n\nrequested a $253 million increase because of the large investment it had made in its system, its\n\nmounting operations costs, and its anticipated need to make capital expenditures. Several parties\n\nintervened. After extensive hearings, the administrative law judges recommended only a $30 million\n\nrate increase. The PUC ultimately approved a $115 million increase.\n\n       Oncor and other parties to the administrative proceeding sued for judicial review and then\n\nappealed to the court of appeals. The disputes have been winnowed to three, and we limit our\n\ndiscussion to them. The PUC concluded that:\n\n       9\n           T EX . U TIL .

The court of\n\nappeals agreed with the PUC on the discount and franchise fee issues but not on the tax issue.11\n\n         Three petitions for review were filed with this Court:\n\n•        The State of Texas, which has universities in Oncor’s service areas, seeks review of the\n         appellate court’s resolution of the discount issue. The State’s petition is opposed by Oncor,\n         the PUC, and CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC, another TDU. Eight state\n         universities in CenterPoint’s service area filed an amicus brief in support of the State’s\n         petition.12 We refer to the State and its amici as “State Universities”.13\n\n\n\n\n         11\n              Id. at 662, 630–631, 654, 659, 665.\n\n         12\n           Amici curiae are the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center at Houston, the University of Texas\nHealth Science Center at Houston, the University of Texas M edical Branch at Galveston, the University of Houston\nSystem, Texas A&M University at Galveston, Texas A&M Health Science Center-Institute of Biosciences &\nTechnology, Texas Engineering Extension Service at Galveston, and Prairie View A&M Nursing School.\n\n         13\n             The governments of the State are unusually divided in this case. The State sued for judicial review in the trial\ncourt in its own name, asserting the consumer interest of its institutions of higher education in the statutory discount. The\nState also has an interest in utility ratemaking through its agency, the PUC, which concluded that Oncor is not required\nto apply the discount to its rates. The State and the PUC, with their conflicting positions, are both represented by the\nAttorney General. The State has since adopted the alias, “State of Texas Agencies and Institutions of Higher Education”,\nshortened to “State Agencies”, apparently to more clearly distinguish between the State’s conflicting interests as both\nconsumer and regulator. But that agnomen suggests that state agencies other than educational institutions have an interest\nin the discount, which, as we explain below, is incorrect. Nor is the State’s consumer interest different from the interest\nof the amici State Universities.

Oncor argued that only REPs provide electric service to retail customers.\n\nThe State Universities opposed Oncor’s position. The PUC agreed with Oncor. Concluding that\n\nSection 36.351 is ambiguous, the court of appeals deferred to the PUC’s interpretation.28\n\n         We do not agree that Section 36.351 is ambiguous. PURA is quite clear: in deregulated areas\n\nof the state, a TDU “may not sell electricity”;29 only REPs can.30 TDUs cannot charge consumers for\n\nelectric service; TDUs charge wholesale tariffed rates set by the PUC to REPs, who in turn charge\n\ncustomers negotiated, competitive retail rates. It follows that TDUs cannot discount rates to\n\nconsumers but only to REPs. But Section 36.351 does not require a discount to REPs. The State\n\nUniversities acknowledge that an REP may not have a legal obligation to pass along a TDU’s\n\ndiscount to consumers but stress that as a practical matter, universities negotiate with REPs for a\n\nstraight pass-through of the TDU charges without any mark-up. The point remains that if universities\n\ncontinue to receive a discount, it is because of negotiation, not because of Section 36.351.

The State Universities argue that TDUs’\n\ntransmission and distribution of electricity to consumers’ service meters is a provision of electric\n\nservice to consumers’ facilities under Section 36.351 because TDUs’ lines connect to meters\n\ninstalled and maintained by TDUs at each retail consumer’s facilities. But while TDUs do provide\n\nelectric service31 —the physical delivery of electricity to consumers’ premises—they provide this\n\nservice to REPs. Only REPs can access the electricity delivered by TDUs. Consumers obtain\n\nelectricity through the service provided by REPs.\n\n         The State Universities argue that to interpret Section 36.351 as not applying to TDUs in\n\nderegulated areas produces an absurd result: a state university facility in a regulated area of the state\n\n—outside ERCOT, where vertically integrated electric utilities still exist and are subject to Section\n\n36.351—would be entitled to a discount, while a facility in ERCOT would not be. The University\n\nof Texas at El Paso would receive the discount; the University of Texas at Arlington would not. But\n\nwe agree with Oncor and the PUC that leaving any discount to negotiation is consistent with the\n\ncompetitive market under deregulation.\n\n         The PUC argues that the Legislature recognized the Section 36.351 discount would not\n\nsurvive deregulation and enacted Section 63 of Senate Bill 7 to extend its effect while the market\n\ntransitioned to competition. The State Universities counter that Section 63 froze the total rates paid\n\n         31\n              Id. § 11.003(19) (“‘Service’ has its broadest and most inclusive meaning. The term includes any act\nperformed, anything supplied, and any facilities used or supplied by a public utility in the performance of the utility’s\nduties . . . to its patrons, employees, other public utilities, an electric cooperative, and the public.”).\n\n                                                           9\n\fby state universities, not merely the discount. But the discount was included in the frozen rates.\n\nSection 63 preserved the discount while capping total rates. Indeed, Section 63 repeatedly referenced\n\nSection 36.351. We think the PUC has the better of the argument.32\n\n         Finally, the State Universities point to PURA Section 36.354 as evidence that Section 36.351\n\napplies to TDUs. Section 36.354 requires electric utilities to discount rates to military bases but only\n\n“in an area where customer choice is not available.”33 Thus, the statute does not apply to TDUs. The\n\nState Universities argue that when the Legislature wanted to exclude TDUs from a discount\n\nprovision, it did so explicitly, and no corresponding language appears in Section 36.351. But in\n\n1995, when Section 36.351 was enacted, it was clearly intended to apply to integrated utilities,\n\nincluding their transmission and distribution operations. Senate Bill 7’s change in the definition of\n\n“electric utility” made Section 36.351, as we have interpreted the provision, inapplicable to TDUs\n\nbut for Section 63, which expired by its own terms in 2007. No change in Section 36.351’s text was\n\nneeded to remove its application to TDUs. Section 36.354 was not enacted until 2003.34 At that\n\npoint, the limitation of its application to areas outside ERCOT, still under regulation, was perfectly\n\nconsistent with Section 36.351.\n\n\n\n         32\n            The State Universities argue that the PUC’s current position is inconsistent with its determination in a 2001\nratemaking case that the TDU was required to discount its rates under Section 36.351.

In October 2007, Oncor became a Delaware limited\nliability corporation.\n\n         44\n            See 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701-2(a) (“A business entity with only one owner is classified as a corporation or is\ndisregarded; if the entity is disregarded, its activities are treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or\ndivision of the owner.”).\n\n                                                             12\n\foperating losses and, as a result, paid no taxes.45 Using 2007 as the test year, and applying Section\n\n36.060(a), Oncor’s projected tax expense was much lower.\n\n         But in November 2008, while this proceeding was still pending in the PUC, EFH sold a\n\n19.96% interest in Oncor to two international investors. At that point, Oncor was a “partnership” for\n\nfederal tax purposes,46 and, because it no longer had a single owner, could not be “‘disregarded’ as\n\nan entity separate from its owner.”47 Federal tax law permitted Oncor to elect to be treated as a\n\ncorporation,48 which would have allowed Oncor to be included in the affiliated group eligible for\n\nEFH’s consolidated tax return.49 But Oncor did not make that election, and so by default it would\n\n\n\n\n         45\n             Oncor did pay EFH $151 million under their tax-sharing agreement, which called for a consolidated federal\nincome tax filing for all EFH’s affiliates and subsidiaries, but specifically “segregated or ring-fenced” Oncor from the\ntax liabilities or benefits of EFH’s affiliates. The agreement provided that, beginning January 1, 2007, Oncor’s income\ntax liability would be calculated and paid on a stand-alone basis as if Oncor were a corporation unrelated to EFH and\nits affiliates. This agreement, of course, does not control the application of Section 36.060.\n\n         46\n             See 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701-2(c)(1) (“For federal tax purposes . . . [t]he term partnership means a business\nentity that is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section and that has at least two members.” (emphasis in\noriginal)).\n\n         47\n          See id. § 301.7701-2(c)(2) (“Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a business entity that has a\nsingle owner and is not a corporation under paragraph (b) of this section is disregarded as an entity separate from its\nowner.”).\n\n         48\n             See id. §§ 301.7701-2(a) (“A business entity with two or more members is classified for federal tax purposes\nas either a corporation or a partnership.”), (b)(2) (“For federal tax purposes, the term corporation means . . . [a]n\nassociation (as determined under § 301.7701-3)” (emphasis in original)); see also id. § 301.7701-3(a) (“A business entity\nthat is not classified as a corporation [under certain regulations] (an eligible entity) can elect its classification for federal\ntax purposes as provided in this section. An eligible entity with at least two members can elect to be classified as either\nan association (and thus a corporation under § 301.7701-2(b)(2)) or a partnership, and an eligible entity with a single\nowner can elect to be classified as an association or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.” (emphasis\nin original)), and (b)(1) (“Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section [recognizing pre-existing classifications],\nunless the entity elects otherwise, a domestic eligible entity is — (i) A partnership if it has two or more members; or (ii)\nDisregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner.”).\n\n         49\n              See 26 U.S.C. § 1504(a)(2) (“80-percent voting and value test”).\n\n                                                               13\n\fbe taxed as a partnership and could not be included in EFH’s consolidated tax return.50 The change\n\ndid not impact EFH financially. EFH included its income as a partner in Oncor in its consolidated\n\ntax return, offset this income with other losses, and realized the same sort of tax savings as before.\n\n        The PUC determined that:\n\n•       Oncor’s tax expense should not be based on 2007 but on its situation after November 2008;\n\n•       after November 2008, Oncor was no longer a member of a group eligible to file a\n        consolidated tax return within the meaning of Section 36.060(a), and therefore that statute\n        did not require calculating its tax return as though it were still included in EFH’s\n        consolidated tax return; and\n\n•       although Oncor would be taxed as a partnership, its tax expense should be calculated as if\n        it were a stand-alone corporation.\n\nThe court of appeals held that because Oncor could have elected to be taxed as a corporation, and\n\nthere was no impediment to its doing so, it remained a member of an affiliated group eligible to file\n\na consolidated tax return.51 Therefore, the court concluded, the PUC should have used the 2007 test\n\nyear and applied Section 34.060(a).52\n\n        We disagree. Section 36.060(a) very plainly applies only to a utility that “is” a member of\n\nan affiliated group eligible to file a consolidated tax return, not a utility that could be. The court of\n\nappeals was troubled that Oncor could use its change of ownership and federal tax law to give EFH\n\nthe savings ratepayers had received when Oncor was included, as a “disregarded” entity, on EFH’s\n\nconsolidated tax return. But that concern cannot be used to read Section 36.060(a) contrary to its\n\n\n        50\n             See id. §§ 1501, 1504.\n\n       51\n             450 S.W .3d 615, 654 (Tex. App.— Austin 2014).\n\n        52\n             Id.\n\n                                                        14\n\fplain text. TIEC argues that the statute should apply because Oncor was “eligible” to be part of a\n\ngroup filing a consolidated tax return. But that misreads the provision. It is the group that must be\n\neligible to file a consolidated return, not the utility. The utility must be a member of an eligible\n\ngroup, and after November 2008, Oncor was not.53\n\n         The developments of November 2008 were “known and measurable changes” the PUC was\n\nrequired to take into account,54 and it correctly interpreted Section 36.060(a). OPUC, Cities, and\n\nTIEC nevertheless argue that the PUC erred in calculating Oncor’s tax expense as if it were a\n\ncorporation when it is taxed as a partnership—that is, its income is passed through to its owners, who\n\nbear the tax. For that reason, they insist, Oncor’s tax expense is minimal. We rejected this argument\n\nin Suburban Utility Corp. v. Public Utility Commission of Texas.55 There, we held that a utility\n\nstructured as a Subchapter S corporation could include, as reasonable and necessary expenses in a\n\nratemaking proceeding, the income taxes paid by its shareholders on the utility’s taxable income.56\n\nCiting precedent from the Commission, we explained that income taxes paid by shareholders of a\n\npass-through entity “are inescapable business outlays and are directly comparable with similar\n\ncorporate taxes which would have been imposed if the utility operations had been carried on by a\n\ncorporation.”57 Fairness “entitled” the owner of a pass-through entity “to a reasonable cost of service\n\n\n         53\n              Section 36.060 has been changed, and how it would now apply is not an issue in the case.\n\n         54\n             See 16 T EX . A D M IN . C O D E § 25.231(b) (“In computing an electric utility’s allowable expenses, only the\nelectric utility’s historical test year expenses as adjusted for known and measurable changes will be considered . . . .”).\n\n         55\n              652 S.W .2d 358 (Tex. 1983).\n\n         56\n              Id. at 363–364.\n\n         57\n              Id. at 364.\n\n                                                            15\n\fallowance for federal income taxes actually paid by its shareholders on [its] taxable income or for\n\ntaxes it would be required to pay as a conventional corporation, whichever is less.”58\n\n         The PUC’s determination to calculate Oncor’s tax expense as if it were a corporation was\n\nnot arbitrary or capricious.59\n\n                                                            IV\n\n         Municipalities franchise to utilities the use of streets, alleys, and other public areas. PURA\n\nstates that it “does not restrict the rights and powers of a municipality to grant or refuse a franchise\n\nto use the streets and alleys in the municipality or to make a statutory charge for that use.”60 But\n\nSenate Bill 7 added PURA Section 33.008, which addresses franchise charges. As related to this\n\ncase:\n\n•        Subsection (a) recognizes that a municipality may impose a reasonable franchise charge on\n         a TDU under competition.61\n\n          58\n             Id. W e later clarified that the Commission is not bound by the taxes actually paid because the statute allowed\nthe Commission discretion in determining the utility’s “fair share” of tax savings from actual or hypothetical consolidated\ntax returns, and in weighing potential future tax expenses from future income.

A municipality may not impose\n         a charge on:\n\n\n\n                                                            16\n\f•       Subsection (b) allows a municipality that imposed franchise charges before competition to\n        continue to charge per kilowatt hour of electricity delivered within the municipality the\n        average such charge imposed in 1998.62\n\n•       Subsection (c) provides that such charges are reasonable and necessary operating expenses\n        of the utility and may be passed on to REPs.63\n\n\n                  (1) an electric utility, or transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or\n        electric cooperative for electric service provided outside the municipality;\n                  (2) a qualifying facility;\n                  (3) an exempt wholesale generator;\n                  (4) a power marketer;\n                  (5) a retail electric provider;\n                  (6) a power generation company;\n                  (7) a person that generates electricity on and after January 1, 2002; or\n                  (8) an aggregator, as that term is defined by Section 39.353.\n\nThe “freeze period” ended when competition began. Id. § 31.002(8) (“‘Freeze period’ means the period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 1999, and ending on December 31, 2001.”).\n\n        62\n             Section 33.008(b) states:\n\n                  If a municipality collected a charge or fee for a franchise to use a municipal street, alley, or\n        public way from an electric utility, a municipally owned utility, or an electric cooperative before the\n        end of the freeze period, the municipality, after the end of the freeze period or after implementation\n        of customer choice by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative, as appropriate, is entitled\n        to collect from each electric utility, transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility,\n        or electric cooperative that uses the municipality’s streets, alleys, or public ways to provide\n        distribution service a charge based on each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by the utility to each\n        retail customer whose consuming facility’s point of delivery is located within the municipality’s\n        boundaries. The charge imposed shall be equal to the total electric franchise fee revenue due the\n        municipality from electric utilities, municipally owned utilities, or electric cooperatives, as\n        appropriate, for calendar year 1998 divided by the total kilowatt hours delivered during 1998 by the\n        applicable electric utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative to retail customers whose\n        consuming facilities’ points of delivery were located within the municipality’s boundaries. The\n        compensation a municipality may collect from each electric utility, transmission and distribution\n        utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative providing distribution service shall be equal\n        to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for 1998 multiplied times the number of kilowatt hours\n        delivered within the municipality’s boundaries.\n\n        63\n             Section 33.008(c) states:\n\n                 The municipal franchise charges authorized by this section shall be considered a reasonable\n        and necessary operating expense of each electric utility, transmission and distribution utility,\n        municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that is subject to a charge under this section. The\n        charge shall be included in the nonbypassable delivery charges that a customer’s retail electric\n        provider must pay under Section 39.107 to the utility serving the customer.\n\n                                                           17\n\f•      Subsection (f) states:\n\n               Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on the expiration of a\n       franchise agreement existing on September 1, 1999, an electric utility, transmission\n       and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative and a\n       municipality may mutually agree to a different level of compensation or to a different\n       method for determining the amount the municipality may charge for the use of a\n       municipal street, alley, or public way in connection with the delivery of electricity at\n       retail within the municipality.64\n\nSection 62(a) of Senate Bill 7 added: “Nothing in this Act shall restrict or limit a municipality’s\n\nhistorical right to control and receive reasonable compensation for use of public streets, alleys,\n\nrights-of-way, or other public property to convey or provide electricity.”\n\n       In its application to the PUC, Oncor proposed to include $253,884,976 of municipal franchise\n\ncharges as a reasonable and necessary operating expense. Of this amount, almost $5.7 million was\n\na 5% increase recently negotiated between Oncor and Cities. The PUC rejected Oncor’s request,\n\nconcluding that a utility cannot pay more than the charge set out in Section 33.008(b). In the court\n\nof appeals, the PUC abandoned that position, which is directly contradicted by Section 33.008(f)’s\n\nphrase, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision”. Instead, the PUC argued, citing the language in\n\nsubsection (f), that Oncor could include in its expenses a charge described in Section 33.008(f) only\n\nif it proved that the charge was agreed to “on the expiration of a franchise agreement existing on\n\nSeptember 1, 1999”.65 The PUC argued that Oncor failed to meet its burden of proof because there\n\nwas less than a scintilla of evidence that Oncor had agreements with the Cities before September 1,\n\n\n\n\n       64\n            Id. § 33.008(f).\n\n       65\n            450 S.W .3d 615, 658–659 (Tex. App.— Austin 2014).\n\n                                                      18\n\fand that these agreements expired thereafter. The court of appeals agreed.66\n\n       But the expiration of a franchise agreement existing on September 1, 1999, cannot be read\n\nas a condition to agreeing to a different charge. If it were, a municipality that had no franchise\n\nagreement with a TDU on that date could never impose a franchise charge in the future. A\n\nmunicipality with a franchise agreement in effect on that date could renegotiate it only once and\n\nnever again afterward. These restrictions would severely limit “a municipality’s historical right to\n\ncontrol and receive reasonable compensation” for the use of public property, in direct contradiction\n\nof Section 62(a) of Senate Bill 7.\n\n       Section 33.008(f) does not restrict renegotiated franchise charges to only those agreed to on\n\nthe expiration of franchise agreements existing on September 1, 1999. The provision simply\n\nprecludes the inference that Section 33.008(b) is exclusive. Reading the paragraphs of Section\n\n33.008 together, as we must, they confirm that municipalities may continue to impose franchise\n\ncharges after competition, that charges per kilowatt hour equal to the average amount charged in\n\n1998 must be considered reasonable and necessary, and that utilities may continue to renegotiate\n\nfranchise charges, though they must demonstrate that the charges are reasonable and necessary in\n\norder to pass them along to REPs.\n\n       The court of appeals misinterpreted Section 33.008(f). The PUC’s disallowance of Oncor’s\n\nrenegotiated franchise charges was error.\n\n\n\n\n       66\n            Id.\n\n                                                19\n\f                                  *      *       *       *       *\n\n       Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and\n\nthe case is remanded to the PUC for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Nathan L.
