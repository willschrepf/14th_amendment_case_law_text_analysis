The Michigan\n\n Campaign Finance Act (MCFA) prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to\n\n make a “contribution or expenditure” for political purposes. MCL 169.257(1). At issue\n\n in this case is whether a public school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan\n\n that collects and remits political contributions from its employees to the Michigan\n\n Education Association’s political action committee (MEA-PAC) runs afoul of § 57 of\n\n MCFA, MCL 169.257(1). We hold that it does. Through administration of a payroll\n\fdeduction plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee, a school district\n\nmakes both a “contribution,” because public resources are being used to advance the\n\npolitical objectives of the committee, and an “expenditure,” because public “services”\n\nand “facilities in assistance of” these same political objectives are being provided. Thus,\n\nthe school district’s payroll deduction plan is prohibited by MCL 169.257.             This\n\ninterpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but also with the\n\nevident purpose of § 57, which is to mandate the separation of the government from\n\npolitics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic\n\nprocesses, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political\n\nactivities. Accordingly, we grant the motion for rehearing, vacate the December 29,\n\n2010, decision of this Court, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1\n\n                               I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n\n       Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary,\n\nincorporated labor organization that represents approximately 136,000 members\n\n\n1\n  Concerning Justice HATHAWAY’s reference to now Chief Justice YOUNG’s dissent in\nUnited States Fidelity & Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass’n (On\nRehearing), 484 Mich 1, 27; 795 NW2d 101 (2009) (USF&G), see the Chief Justice’s\nresponse in his concurring opinion in Anglers of the AuSable v Dep’t of Environmental\nQuality, 489 Mich 884, 885 (2011), the thrust of which was that the majority opinion in\nUSF&G prevailed over his dissent, as is the fate of most dissents. The Chief Justice casts\nhis vote in this case as justices have traditionally done, in accordance with their original\nvote in the underlying case, and our new justices, Justices MARY BETH KELLY and\nZAHRA, also cast their vote as new justices have traditionally done, in accordance with\ntheir best understanding of the law. See, e.g., USF&G, in which Justice HATHAWAY\nherself cast a vote in this manner, and Duncan v Michigan, 488 Mich 957 (2010) (DAVIS,\nJ., concurring), in which the fourth justice in support of the former majority opinion in\nthis case also cast his vote in this manner. Justice HATHAWAY would apparently require\nthe majority justices in this case to abide by an entirely different set of legal rules.\n\n\n                                             2\n\femployed by public schools, colleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA-\n\nPAC is a separate segregated political fund established by the MEA in accordance with\n\n§ 55 of MCFA, MCL 169.255.            The MEA-PAC is significantly funded by payroll\n\ndeductions of MEA members who have authorized the deductions. The purpose of the\n\nMEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in politics by\n\nelecting candidates favored by the MEA and by furthering the enactment of MEA\n\nlegislative and executive policy initiatives.\n\n       As a public-employee labor organization, the MEA has entered into collective\n\nbargaining agreements with various public school districts across the state. Some number\n\nof these agreements, including that between the MEA’s locally affiliated Kalamazoo\n\nCounty/Gull Lake Education Associations and the Gull Lake Community Schools (the\n\nschool district), require that a school district administer a payroll deduction plan for the\n\ncontributions of MEA members to the MEA-PAC.                Administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan requires the school district to distribute payroll deduction forms; collect,\n\nenter, and monitor the data of participating MEA members; and record, track, and\n\ntransmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC. In return for these services, the MEA has\n\nproposed to pay all costs that the school district incurs in administering the plan.\n\n       In this case, the school district conditioned acceptance of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement on the MEA obtaining a declaratory ruling concerning the validity of the\n\npayroll deduction plan. Accordingly, on August 22, 2006, the MEA filed a request for a\n\ndeclaratory ruling with respondent, the Secretary of State, to determine whether the\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fschool district could make and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC.2\n\nRespondent ruled that, absent express statutory authority, the school district is prohibited\n\nfrom expending public resources for a payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-\n\nPAC. The MEA appealed to the circuit court, which held that respondent’s ruling was\n\n“arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion,” reasoning that, although the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the plan constitutes an “expenditure” under MCFA, when the\n\ncosts of administering the plan have been reimbursed, “no transfer of money to the MEA-\n\nPAC has occurred, and therefore an ‘expenditure’ has not been made within the meaning\n\nof the MCFA.”\n\n         In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 57 of MCFA\n\nprohibits a “public body,” such as a school district, from using public resources “to make\n\na contribution or expenditure.” According to the Court, the costs associated with the plan\n\nconstitute an “expenditure,” and the reimbursement of such costs does not alter that\n\nconclusion. Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 280 Mich App 477, 486; 761 NW2d 234\n\n(2008). Judge WHITBECK dissented and would have affirmed the trial court, but on\n\ndifferent grounds. He reasoned that the costs incurred by the school district in its\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan do not constitute an “expenditure” as MCFA\n\ndefines it.    Id. at 490.    The MEA then sought leave to appeal in this Court.        On\n\nNovember 5, 2009, we heard oral arguments on the application,3 and nearly seven months\n\n2\n The Secretary of State is authorized to issue declaratory rulings to implement MCFA,\nMCL 169.201 et seq., in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, MCL\n24.201 to 24.328.\n3\n    The Court directed the parties to brief\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\flater we granted the MEA’s application for leave to appeal.4 Finally, on December 29,\n\n2010, a majority of this Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and held\n\nthat a school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to the\n\nMEA-PAC “is not precluded by any prohibition in MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore\n\npermitted.” Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 488 Mich 18, 21; 793 NW2d 568 (2010).\n\nRespondent moved for rehearing of the Court’s December 29, 2010, decision, arguing\n\nthat the Court committed error by holding that a public school’s administration of a\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee was not\n\nprohibited by MCL 169.257(1). We now grant respondent’s motion for rehearing, and\n\nwe vacate the December 29, 2010, decision of this Court, and affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n       (1) whether a school district’s use of government resources for a payroll\n       deduction plan for contributions made by members of [the MEA] to MEA’s\n       political action committee is either an “expenditure” or a “contribution”\n       under § 6 of the [MCFA], MCL 169.206; (2) whether § 57(1) of the\n       MCFA, MCL 169.257(1), prohibits a school district from expending\n       governmental resources for such a payroll deduction plan if the costs of the\n       plan are prepaid by the MEA; and (3) whether a school district has the\n       authority to collect and deliver payroll deductions for such contributions.\n       [Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 483 Mich 1001 (2009).]\n4\n  The order granting leave to appeal directed the parties to address the effect, if any, of\nCitizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 US __; 130 S Ct 876; 175 L Ed 2d 753\n(2010). Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 486 Mich 952 (2010). It was clear from the\noutset that Citizens United had no discernible effect on this case and that the grant of\nleave to appeal, following the argument on the application, imposed unnecessary\nexpenses on the parties and considerably delayed resolution of an important dispute of\nstatewide importance. See id. at 953 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f                              II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The interpretation of statutes constitutes a question of law that this Court reviews\n\nde novo on appeal. Eggleston v Bio-Med Applications of Detroit, Inc, 468 Mich 29, 32;\n\n658 NW2d 139 (2003).\n\n                             III. PURPOSE OF MCL 169.257\n\n       “It is well settled that the Legislature of this state is empowered to enact laws to\n\npromote and regulate political campaigns and candidacies.” Council No 11, AFSCME v\n\nCivil Serv Comm, 408 Mich 385, 395; 292 NW2d 442 (1980) (citations omitted). The\n\npeople of Michigan have granted the Legislature broad powers to regulate elections.\n\nAmong other things, our Constitution empowers the Legislature to set forth the\n\nqualifications of electors; the time, place, and manner of elections; and limitations on\n\nterms of office. Const 1963, art 2, §§ 1 through 10. Furthermore, Const 1963, art 2, § 4\n\nrequires the Legislature to preserve the integrity of elections, providing in pertinent part:\n\n              The legislature shall enact laws to preserve the purity of elections, to\n       preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective\n       franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee\n       voting.\n\nCharged to preserve the “purity of elections” and to “guard against abuses of the elective\n\nfranchise,” the Legislature enacted MCL 169.257, commonly referred to as § 57 of\n\nMCFA. Section 57 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources “to make a\n\ncontribution or expenditure” for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of\n\na candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The clear\n\npurpose of § 57, as reflected in its language, is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\n\n                                              6\n\fpreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities.5\n\n                                         IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       MCL 169.257(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n       or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n       software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n       other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide\n       volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of\n       contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)].\n\n       There is no question that a school district constitutes a “public body” within the\n\nmeaning of § 57.6 Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether by administering a\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to a political action committee, a school district\n\nmakes a “contribution or expenditure” within the meaning of the same provision. If the\n\nplan does, it is expressly prohibited.\n\n                                   A. “CONTRIBUTION”\n\n       MCL 169.204(1) defines a “contribution” as follows:\n\n\n5\n  See also, e.g., the political activities by public employees act, MCL 15.401 et seq.\n(providing that an employee of the state or local unit of government may not engage in\npolitical affairs during working hours); the Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act,\nMCL 432.201 et seq. (providing that members, employees, or agents of the Michigan\nGaming Control Board may not engage in political activity for the duration of their\nemployment); and Civil Service Rule 1-12.6 (prohibiting state employees from\nparticipating in political activities during working hours).\n6\n   MCFA defines a “public body” to include “[a] county, city, township, village,\nintercounty, intercity, or regional governing body; a council, school district, special\ndistrict, or municipal corporation; or a board, department, commission, or council or an\nagency of a board, department, commissioner, or council.” MCL 169.211(6)(c).\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f             “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n      expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n      loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n      a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for\n      the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for\n      the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[7]\n\nAn “in-kind contribution” is defined as a “contribution . . . other than money.” MCL\n\n169.209(3).\n\n      The school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan that facilitates\n\npayments to the MEA-PAC is prohibited by MCL 169.257(1) because the school district\n\nuses its public resources “to make a contribution” in a variety of ways. First, the school\n\ndistrict employs public resources to administer the plan that allows MEA members “to\n\nmake a contribution.” For example, the school district must use its paper, pens, and\n\ncopiers to develop and execute payroll deduction authorization forms; school personnel\n\nmust collect, enter, and monitor the data of participating MEA members into computers\n\nand accounting software, all of which must be specifically configured to record, track,\n\nand transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; school personnel must then be\n\nprepared to respond to individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to\n\nadjust or correct or withdraw their own deduction authorizations; and this process must\n\nnecessarily involve the use of public office space, equipment, and employee time. Use of\n\nthe school district’s resources to facilitate MEA members’ “contributions” constitutes a\n\nstraightforward violation of MCL 169.257(1). More specifically, § 57(1) prohibits the\n\nschool district from using its resources “to make a contribution.” To “make” pertinently\n\n7\n  The MEA-PAC is a “person” because, as a separate segregated fund, it functions as the\nresult of an organization or group of persons acting jointly. See MCL 169.211(1).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fmeans “to cause to exist or happen[.]” Random House Webster’s College Dictionary\n\n(2000), def 2. The school district “makes” a “contribution” to the MEA-PAC because it\n\n“causes to exist or happen” “contributions” from MEA members that otherwise would\n\nnot be made but for the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan.8\n\n       Second, the school district itself makes a prohibited “contribution” to the MEA-\n\nPAC because its administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes something of\n\n“ascertainable monetary value.” There is inherent value to the MEA-PAC in having\n\npayroll deductions automatically taken from members’ wages as opposed to requiring\n\nindividual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. That there is such “ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue” is self-evident from the very fact that the MEA-PAC has affirmatively sought out\n\nthe assistance of the school district and has litigated to the highest court of this state an\n\nappeal asserting its right to enter into the instant agreement with the school district.\n\nParties do not typically enter into contracts absent a belief that the rights or benefits\n\naccorded them under the contract have some “ascertainable monetary value,” and the\n\ninstant contract seems no different. Such value can almost certainly be identified as the\n\nsum of (a) the additional contributions resulting from the ease of the payroll deduction\n\n8\n  All agree that the MEA members’ “payment” or “donation of money” to the MEA-PAC\nconstitutes a “contribution” under MCL 169.204(1) and that the school district facilitates\nthat “contribution” to the MEA-PAC. However, Justice CAVANAGH asserts that the\nschool district does not employ public resources to “make” the MEA members’\ncontribution because it “merely transfers money from one place to another.” Post at\n6 n 4. This characterization significantly trivializes the nature of the school district’s\nparticipation in the MEA-PAC’s fundraising. As already discussed, to “make” relevantly\nmeans to “cause to exist or happen.” Simply put, if the public resources of the school\ndistrict had not been employed to facilitate the MEA members’ contributions, those\n“contributions” would not have “happened.”\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fprocess compared to a political contribution process in which individual solicitations\n\nmust be undertaken and (b) the reduced administrative and transactional costs of the\n\nformer process compared to the latter process. The MEA obviously prefers the payroll\n\ndeduction process because it is a more efficient, and a more productive, process by which\n\nto secure funding for its political activities. The school district is not incidental to this\n\nprocess, but constitutes an indispensable element.          Without the school district’s\n\ncontracted-for services, some lesser amount of contributions would presumably be raised\n\non behalf of the MEA-PAC, and at a greater cost.9\n\n       Third, the administration of the payroll deduction plan also constitutes an “in-kind\n\ncontribution,” defined by MCL 169.209(3) as a “contribution . . . other than money.”\n\n9\n  Relying on the dictionary definition of “ascertain,” Justice HATHAWAY asserts that the\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not have “ascertainable\nmonetary value” because the monetary benefits conveyed to the MEA-PAC have not\nbeen “determined definitely, with certainty and assurance.” Post at 11. Unfortunately,\nJustice HATHAWAY has defined the wrong word. “Ascertainable” does not mean “to find\nout definitely” or “learn with certainty or assurance,” as Justice HATHAWAY opines,\nbecause that is the definition of “ascertain,” not “ascertainable.” Random House\nWebster’s College Dictionary (2000). Rather, “ascertainable” means “able to be\nascertained.” New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed) (emphasis added).\n\n        While the MEA has not provided this Court with numbers regarding the specific\nbenefits yielded from the district’s administration of the deduction plan, it is safe to say\nthat the additional contributions garnered, and the reduction in administrative and\ntransactional costs, are “able to be ascertained.” In short, if the school district no longer\nautomatically deducted contributions from the paychecks of its employees, the MEA\nwould have to bear the added cost of individually contacting each of its members and\nindividually soliciting contributions from them. Everyone understands that this\nprocedure would be a far more costly, and less effective, way of collecting political\ncontributions than the current procedure. Such a cost is easily “ascertainable,” even if the\nMEA and Justice HATHAWAY are uninterested in calculating it, and thus the cost of direct\nsolicitation that the MEA avoids by the current procedure constitutes a “contribution” as\nMCFA defines it.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fAlthough it is clearly possible to quantify the time spent by employees and the resources\n\nexpended by the school district in administering the deduction plan, and thereby to\n\nascertain the cost of such a “contribution” to the school district, it is more difficult to\n\nquantify the intangible benefits that the MEA receives from the deduction plan.\n\nHowever, it is quite certain that these benefits substantially outweigh the costs to the\n\nschool district, and therefore cannot be calculated simply by reference to the school\n\ndistrict’s costs. The most significant of these is simply the extent of access to a district’s\n\nMEA membership that is afforded the MEA-PAC by the deduction plan. Such access\n\navoids any need on the part of the MEA-PAC to establish its own administrative\n\napparatus for political fundraising, vitiates its need to engage in mailings and alternative\n\nforms of communications with its members, and dispenses with its burden of having to\n\nprocess checks, money orders, or credit cards from contributors, as would be necessary\n\nfor any other solicitor of political contributions. As MEA’s counsel at oral argument\n\nacknowledged, this procedure has proven to be an “effective” means to raise money.\n\nAlmost certainly, the marginal administrative costs of the payroll deduction plan to the\n\nschool district, which already may have in place a mechanism by which taxes and\n\ncharitable contributions can be deducted from employees’ paychecks, will be less than\n\nthe administrative costs of an equivalent plan to the MEA, which does not already have a\n\nsimilar mechanism in place. The difference between these respective costs can fairly be\n\ndescribed as an “in-kind contribution” by the school district to the MEA-PAC, however\n\ndifficult it may be specifically to quantify in dollars. It is a “contribution . . . other than\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fmoney” that is made for the “purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”10\n\n       The services undertaken on behalf of the MEA-PAC are “made for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or\n\ndefeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.204(1), because, as discussed earlier, the purpose\n\nof the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in partisan\n\npolitics.11 Thus, the school district’s administration of the deduction plan constitutes a\n\n\n10\n   Justice HATHAWAY asserts that “this argument ignores that an in-kind contribution\nmust still be a ‘contribution’ as defined by the statute.” Post at 12 (emphasis added).\nThis point is hardly “ignored,” for it constitutes the principal focal point of the instant\nsection. That the administration of the deduction plan not only constitutes a\n“contribution” but also an “in-kind contribution” merely establishes an additional way in\nwhich the school district’s administration of the plan is prohibited by MCFA.\n11\n   The previous majority opinion stated that “[w]hen a public body administers a payroll\ndeduction plan, it does not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot\nquestion.” Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 37. However, that opinion failed to recognize\nthat MCL 169.204(1) defines “contribution” as “a payment . . . made for the purpose of\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or\ndefeat of a ballot question.” (Emphasis added.) As discussed, the school district uses its\npublic resources “to make” the MEA members’ payments. Therefore, the pertinent\nquestion is not whether the “public body” itself is attempting to influence a political race\nor ballot question, but whether payments that result from its administration of the payroll\ndeduction plan are intended for that purpose. It is obvious here that the “payment[s] [are]\nmade for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.” Id. This is the purpose that\nindividual MEA members have in mind when they authorize payments, and it is the\npurpose that the MEA-PAC has in mind when it receives payments from the school\ndistrict. It is equally obvious that the school district itself must be fully cognizant of this\npurpose both when it receives payments from individual MEA members and when it\ndelivers payments to the MEA-PAC. That the school district itself might not care\nwhether such payments will influence a political race or ballot question does not alter the\nfact that the purpose of these payments is to do precisely that.\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f“contribution” as that term is defined by MCL 169.204(1).12 Because the school district\n\nemploys public resources to make this “contribution,” its administration of the deduction\n\nplan is a straightforward violation of § 57 of MCFA.\n\n                                 B. “EXPENDITURE”\n\n      Section 57 of MCFA also prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to\n\nmake an “expenditure.” MCL 169.257(1). An “expenditure” is defined as\n\n      a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of\n      ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in\n      assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate,\n      or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. [MCL\n      169.206(1).]\n\nThe school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-\n\nPAC constitutes a prohibited “expenditure” because the school district directly provides\n\n“services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC. The school district provides\n\n“services” to the MEA-PAC in its administration of the deduction plan by developing and\n\nexecuting payroll deduction authorization forms; by collecting, entering, and monitoring\n\nthe data of MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must be\n\nconfigured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; and by\n\naccommodating individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to adjust or\n\n12\n  The previous majority opinion erred when it concluded that administration of the plan\n“merely allows someone else to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a\npolitical issue,” Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 37, i.e., the MEA member who has\nauthorized the payroll deduction. Instead, the school district itself makes both a\n“contribution” and an “in-kind contribution” by providing valuable services to the MEA-\nPAC in aid and furtherance of its political activities. That is, quite independently of the\ncontributions of individual MEA members, the school district contributes something of\nfurther “ascertainable monetary value” to the MEA-PAC.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fcorrect or withdraw their deduction authorizations. Further, the school district provides\n\n“facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC through the use of public office space and\n\nequipment. These “services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC are, once\n\nagain, made for the purpose of “the nomination or election of a candidate, or the\n\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.206(1), because, as\n\ndiscussed previously, the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the\n\ninvolvement of the MEA in politics, by electing candidates favored by the MEA and by\n\nenacting MEA legislative and policy initiatives. Thus, the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan constitutes an “expenditure” as that term is defined by MCL\n\n169.206(1) and is specifically prohibited.\n\n       Justice HATHAWAY concedes that the school district’s administration of the\n\ndeduction plan “falls within the general definition of ‘expenditure’ under MCL\n\n169.206(1) . . . .” Post at 6. However, she would hold, as would Justice CAVANAGH, that\n\nthe plan also falls within a specific statutory exclusion from the definition of an\n\n“expenditure.” This exception provides that an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n\n\nexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee.” MCL 169.206(2)(c). According to\n\nJustice HATHAWAY, a school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that\n\nremits payments to a political action committee constitutes an “‘expenditure for the\n\nestablishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\nfund or independent committee’” and is, therefore, allowed under § 57. Post at 7,\n\nquoting MCL 169.206(2)(c). However, her analysis overlooks the fact that a “public\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fbody,” such as a school district, is not authorized to establish a separate segregated fund\n\nunder MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion.\n\n       Instead, this exclusion is clearly designed to apply only to corporations and labor\n\norganizations that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate\n\nsegregated funds in the first place. This interpretation, limiting the § 6(2)(c) exclusion to\n\ncorporations and labor organizations, is a necessary implication from the structure of\n\nMCFA for three reasons. First, § 54 of MCFA, MCL 169.254, imposes the same rule,\n\nprohibiting the making of a “contribution or expenditure,” on corporations and labor\n\norganizations that § 57 imposes on public bodies. In pertinent part, § 54 provides:\n\n             Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in . . . section\n       55 [MCL 169.255]. . . a corporation, joint stock company, domestic\n       dependent sovereign, or labor organization shall not make a contribution or\n       expenditure . . . . [MCL 169.254(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n       Second, unlike § 57, § 54 does not constitute an absolute prohibition against\n\nmaking a “contribution or expenditure”; rather, pursuant to § 55,\n\n       [a] corporation organized on a for-profit or non-profit basis, a joint stock\n       company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed\n       under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make an\n       expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n       A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n       making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n       committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n       political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]\n\n       Third, there is no similar counterpart in § 57 that allows a “public body” to make\n\n“an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions\n\nto a separate segregated fund . . . .” Thus, under § 55, the only entities allowed to\n\nestablish a separate segregated fund are corporations, joint stock companies, domestic\n\n\n                                             15\n\fdependent sovereigns, or labor organizations, such as the MEA. Considered together,\n\n§ 55 and the § 6(2)(c) exclusion that permits an “expenditure for the establishment,\n\nadministration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund” provide a\n\nlimited mechanism allowing entities such as the MEA to create, establish, administer, or\n\nfund a separate segregated fund for purposes that would otherwise be disallowed by § 54.\n\nIn contrast, a “public body,” such as a school district, is not entitled to create, establish,\n\nadminister, or fund a separate segregated fund, under § 55 or any other provision, and\n\nthus may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.”13\n\n13\n   Justice CAVANAGH asserts that there is “simply no basis in the statutory language to\nsupport the majority’s position.” Post at 12. As discussed, our position, limiting the\n§ 6(2)(c) exclusion to § 55 entities, such as corporations and labor organizations, is a\nnecessary and logical implication derived from MCFA. In discerning legislative intent,\n“[t]he whole act provides [the] proper ‘frame of reference,’” and each section must be\nconsidered together with other sections. Metro Council No 23, AFSCME v Oakland Co\nProsecutor, 409 Mich 299, 318; 294 NW2d 578 (1980) (citation omitted). The exclusion\nof certain expenditures from the definition of “expenditure” in § 6(2)(c) invokes exactly\nthe same operative language as § 55 and is plainly directed toward elaborating on § 55 by\nmaking clear that no expenditures authorized by § 55 for the establishment of a separate\nsegregated fund will be treated as a prohibited expenditure by § 54. This does not render\n§ 6(2)(c) “superfluous” or “completely unnecessary,” as Justice CAVANAGH claims. Post\nat 12. Rather, as already explained, § (6)(2)(c) serves to underscore, and to make\nexplicit, what is otherwise only implicit in § 55-- that “expenditures” permitted by § 55\nare not otherwise prohibited by § 54.\n\n        Furthermore, if § (6)(2)(c) is interpreted to apply to public bodies, which are not\nauthorized to establish separate segregated funds in the first place, the operative language\nof § 57, which prohibits the use of public resources to subsidize partisan political\nactivities, would be rendered null and void. When a political action committee\ncommandeers the resources of the government to raise political contributions for its own\nbenefit, as occurred here, that conduct could always be categorized under Justice\nCAVANAGH’s interpretation as falling within the § 6(2)(c) exception and rendered\npermissible. Thus, the § 6(2)(c) exception would entirely consume the rule prohibiting\npublic bodies from making “expenditures” for political purposes, and the Legislature\nwould effectively have taken with the right hand what it had just given with the left.\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Even if, as Justice HATHAWAY claims, the § 6(2)(c) exclusion is not limited to\n\n§ 55 entities, her application of the exclusion remains illogical. Justice HATHAWAY\n\nconcludes that although a school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\nconstitutes an “expenditure,” it is nevertheless\n\n       explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL 169.206(2)(c),\n       which provides that an “expenditure for the establishment, administration,\n       or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n       committee” is not an “expenditure.” A public school’s administration of a\n       payroll deduction system falls squarely within the statutory exception. The\n       system is set up to facilitate MEA member contributions to their separate\n       segregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore, the administration of the\n       system is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA. [Post at 6.]\n\nJustice HATHAWAY thus concludes that the administration of a payroll deduction plan\n\nfalls “squarely within the statutory exception.”        Under MCL 169.206(2)(c), an\n\n“expenditure” does not encompass what would otherwise be an “expenditure” for (a)\n\nestablishment of a separate segregated fund or independent committee, (b) administration\n\nof a separate segregated fund or independent committee, or (c) solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee. Thus, in order to\n\n\n\nUnder such an interpretation, § 6(2)(c) would allow the Secretary of State’s office, for\nexample, to solicit contributions to a partisan or special interest political action\ncommittee with each driver’s license renewal communication; it would allow Secretary\nof State employees to administer the political contributions received through this process;\nit would allow Secretary of State facilities and computers to be deployed to make and\nprint relevant informational pamphlets and political action committee materials; and it\nwould allow the Secretary of State’s office to attach the postage for these solicitations.\nThis interpretation cannot conceivably be what the Legislature intended when it enacted\nMCFA. Reading MCFA in its entirety, and in context, it is clear that the Legislature\nintended the § 6(2)(c) exception to apply only to those entities that possess the authority\nto create, establish, administer, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\ffall within the purview of this exception, a “public body” must be engaged in one of these\n\nenumerated activities. In this case, however, the school district is engaged in none.14\n\n       First, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the establishment of a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee because the separate segregated fund,\n\nthe MEA-PAC, has already been established by the MEA. In any event, the school\n\ndistrict could not establish a separate segregated fund in the first place, because that\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Justice CAVANAGH concludes that MCFA excepts from the definition of “expenditure”\nan “expenditure” for the (a) establishment of contributions to a separate segregated fund,\n(b) administration of contributions to a separate segregated fund, and (c) solicitation of\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund. Reading § 6(2)(c) in isolation could support\nhis interpretation; however, reading MCFA in its entirety, in particular after due\nconsideration of MCL 169.255(1), makes clear that the only reasonable interpretation of\n§ 6(2)(c) is that it pertains to the “establishment” or “administration” of a “separate\nsegregated fund” and not the “establishment” or “administration” of “contributions.” See\nSun Valley Foods Co v Ward, 460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (“The statutory\nlanguage must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that\nsomething different was intended.”). His interpretation disregards the fact that this Court\nmust consider § 6(2)(c) and § 55 together, “so as to produce, if possible, an harmonious\nand consistent enactment” of MCFA. State Treasurer v Wilson, 423 Mich 138, 145; 377\nNW2d 703 (1985). Unmistakably, the objective of § 55 is to provide authority for certain\n(private) entities to establish and operate a separate segregated fund, and, in pursuit of\nthis objective, § 55 provides that such entities “may make an expenditure for the\nestablishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\nfund.” As the only legislative authority allowing for the creation of a separate segregated\nfund, the use of the terms “establishment” and “administration” must pertain to the\n“establishment” or “administration” of a “separate segregated fund,” and not to the\n“establishment” or “administration” of “contributions”; otherwise, the ability to establish\nand administer a separate segregated fund could not exist in the first place. And\n§ 6(2)(c), which uses nearly identical language, must be interpreted the same way, “so as\nto produce . . . an harmonious and consistent enactment” of MCFA. Wilson, 423 Mich at\n145.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\fauthority is limited to the entities enumerated in § 55 (corporations, joint stock\n\ncompanies, domestic dependent sovereigns, and labor organizations).\n\n         Second, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the administration\n\nof a separate segregated fund or independent committee because the school district is not\n\n“administering” the MEA-PAC; rather, the school district is simply administering the\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to the MEA-PAC. That is, the school district\n\nmakes no determinations at all concerning amounts of funds to be raised from MEA\n\nmembers or other funding sources; the nature and substance of communications to MEA\n\nmembers and other funding sources about the need and urgency of such contributions; the\n\nidentification of political candidates and causes as beneficiaries of the MEA-PAC, and in\n\nwhat amounts; or strategies for optimizing the impact of MEA-PAC participation in\n\npolitical campaigns and causes. Justice HATHAWAY, however, would hold that the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute dictates that the administration costs at issue are excluded from\n\nthe statutory term “expenditure.” See post at 6. In so asserting, Justice HATHAWAY\n\nmisinterprets the statute, because the only administrative costs that are excluded under\n\nthis exclusion are those associated with administering a “separate segregated fund or\n\nindependent committee.” MCL 169.206(2)(c). That the school district is administering a\n\nprocess by which payments are remitted to such a fund is hardly the equivalent of\n\nadministering the fund itself, such that the § 6(2)(c) exclusion would apply. Justice\n\nHATHAWAY is confused in this regard.15\n\n15\n     Justice HATHAWAY asserts:\n\n                 This argument is unfounded and contrary to the plain language of the\n         statute. The plain language of the statute applies to the administration of\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       Third, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee; rather, the school\n\ndistrict is using public resources for processing payments to the MEA-PAC.               As\n\ndiscussed earlier, the school district’s “expenditure” consists of the use of personnel,\n\noffice space, computers, software, and other public resources to remit payments to the\n\nMEA-PAC. The school district is not, for example, maintaining an advertising campaign\n\non behalf of the MEA-PAC, cold-calling MEA members, or preparing mailers or\n\nbrochures to enlist contributors. As such, the school district’s use of public resources for\n\nprocessing payments to the MEA-PAC cannot be viewed as soliciting contributions, but\n\nonly as facilitating such contributions, an entirely distinct concept.      It follows that\n\nbecause the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not fall\n\nwithin any of the three enumerated exclusions set forth in MCL 169.206(2)(c), it is not\n\nexcluded from the definition of an “expenditure.”16\n\n\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund; the statute does not specify\n       who has to make the contributions. The MEA members’ contributions to\n       the MEA-PAC are administered through the payroll deduction system.\n       Thus, the district, by administering the payroll deduction system, is\n       administering contributions to the MEA-PAC, an action that is explicitly\n       allowed according to the plain language of the statute. [Post at 6-7.]\nThis does not make sense. Even if MCL 169.206(2)(c) were not limited to § 55 entities,\nthis provision does not exclude from the definition of “expenditure” an “expenditure” for\nthe “administration of contributions”; rather it excludes an “expenditure” for the\nadministration of a “separate segregated fund or independent committee,” which is\ninapplicable here for the simple reason that the school district is not making an\n“expenditure” for the administration of a separate segregated fund or independent\ncommittee.\n16\n   Even assuming arguendo that the school district’s administration of the payroll\ndeduction plan constitutes “an expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n\n\n                                            20\n\f                     C. RELEVANCE OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS\n\n       Having determined that the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan that remits payments to the MEA-PAC constitutes both a “contribution”\n\nand an “expenditure,” the question remains whether the MEA’s preparedness to pay in\n\nadvance the school district’s costs associated with the plan remedies what would\n\notherwise constitute a violation of § 57. For the reasons that follow, it does not.\n\n       The Court of Appeals correctly held that there is “nothing in the plain language of\n\nthe MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates something that otherwise constitutes an\n\nexpenditure.” Mich Ed Ass’n, 280 Mich App at 486. A court’s primary purpose in\n\ninterpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. Frankenmuth Mut\n\nIns Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, 456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998). “Courts may\n\nnot speculate regarding legislative intent beyond the words expressed in a statute. Hence,\n\nnothing may be read into a statute that is not within the manifest intent of the Legislature\n\nas derived from the act itself.” Omne Fin, Inc v Shacks, Inc, 460 Mich 305, 311; 596\n\nNW2d 591 (1999) (citations omitted). The Legislature declined to provide that advance\n\npayments remedy what would otherwise constitute a violation of § 57.\n\n       The suggestion that advance payments remedy a violation of § 57 is belied by the\n\nterms of the statute. Section 57 provides that “[a] public body . . . shall not use or\n\nauthorize the use” of public resources to make a “contribution or expenditure . . . .”\n\nMCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added). The use of “shall” in a statute generally “indicates a\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,”\nwhich we believe it plainly does not, by its terms, the exclusion only applies to an\n“expenditure” and not to a “contribution.”\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fmandatory and imperative directive.” Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, 471 Mich 745,\n\n752; 691 NW2d 424 (2005) (citations omitted). As such, the statute mandates that the\n\nschool district not “use or authorize the use of” its public resources to make a\n\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” Nothing in MCFA leads to the conclusion that the\n\nLegislature intended § 57 to be interpreted any differently. Irrespective of whether the\n\nschool district is reimbursed for its administration of the payroll deduction plan, the\n\nschool district nonetheless has employed public resources to make a “contribution or\n\nexpenditure” for political purposes.17 The advance payment of expenses simply does not\n\nnegate what § 57 is intended to prohibit. That is, the gravamen of § 57 is not that a\n\n“public body” whose resources have been employed for private political purposes be\n\ncompensated on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but that public resources not be used for such\n\npurposes in the first place. That the costs of dismantling the wall separating government\n\nand partisan political campaigning are to be paid by those who desire to use taxpayer\n\nresources for partisan political campaigning is not the point of § 57; rather, it is that the\n\nwall not be dismantled.18\n\n17\n  Moreover, the advance payment of the school district’s expenses in administering the\ndeduction plan does not avoid the question of the extent to which an exchange of\nsomething of “ascertainable monetary value” has taken place. If the school district has\nprovided a service “at cost” to the MEA-PAC, even though the “ascertainable monetary\nvalue” of that service to the MEA-PAC exceeds that cost, as it almost always will in an\neconomy in which service providers typically seek to profit from their services, further\ninquiry would be necessary concerning the specific terms of the school district-political\naction committee transaction, even if such a transaction were permissible in the first place\nunder § 57.\n18\n  If the MEA-PAC is allowed to commandeer the resources of a “public body” simply by\nreimbursing its costs, there is nothing that would prevent the political action committee of\nany corporation from demanding or receiving the same treatment.\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\f        Furthermore, the unquantifiable cost to the school district, as well as to taxpayers,\n\nparents, and students, of having time and resources diverted from the school district’s\n\nprimary responsibilities of administering schools and educating students in order to\n\nadminister a process of raising political contributions for the MEA-PAC cannot simply be\n\npaid in advance or reimbursed. Time is a zero-sum resource, and it is irretrievably lost to\n\ntaxpayers, parents, and students when it is taken away from the former responsibilities\n\nand redirected to the latter responsibilities. If some lesser portion of each day is devoted\n\nto the interests of the school district and a greater portion of each day is devoted to the\n\npartisan political interests of a labor organization, taxpayers, parents, and students suffer.\n\nAlthough advance payment may recompense the school district its employees’ salaries\n\nfor the time spent on administration of the plan and for the use of supplies and other\n\npublic resources, monetary reimbursement, paid in advance or otherwise, is simply\n\ninsufficient to recover the time that is diverted from the primary obligations of the school\n\ndistrict.\n\n        Moreover, because neither advance payments nor reimbursements prevent the\n\nprohibited “use” of public resources from occurring in the first place, the act is\n\npunishable as a misdemeanor and subject to a fine that may be “equal to the amount of\n\nthe improper contribution or expenditure.” MCL 169.257(2)(b). The fact that one of the\n\npenalties for making an improper “contribution or expenditure” requires the violator to\n\npay an amount that is “equal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure”\n\nindicates strongly that such a payment, whether in the form of a “penalty” or a\n\n“reimbursement,” does not transform an improper “contribution or expenditure” into a\n\nproper one. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, the misdemeanor statute would\n\n\n                                             23\n\fmore likely have read that the criminal sanction to be paid is “equal to the amount of the\n\nimproper contribution or expenditure, less any reimbursement of such contribution or\n\nexpenditure.”19\n\n                              V. RESPONSE TO DISSENTS\n\n       As discussed previously, Justice HATHAWAY’s position that the school district’s\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction plan is not an “expenditure” because the cost of\n\nadministration is an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,” MCL\n\n\n19\n   The MEA also argues with regard to reimbursements that because the school district is\nreimbursed all costs and expenses, its administration of the deduction plan does not\namount to a “contribution or expenditure” given that a “contribution” does not encompass\n“[a]n offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned,\nor refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt,” MCL\n169.204(3)(c), and an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n offer or tender of an\nexpenditure if expressly and unconditionally rejected or returned,” MCL 169.206(2)(e).\nHowever, this argument clearly lacks merit because the MEA-PAC’s offer to reimburse\nexpenses can hardly be said to constitute a “rejection, return, or refund” of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” When the school district collects and remits\npayments from MEA members to the MEA-PAC, it makes an “offer or tender” of a\n“contribution or expenditure.” To qualify for the “offer or tender” exception, the MEA-\nPAC would have to unconditionally “reject or return” the services of the school district,\nsomething that it neither does nor has any intention of doing. Because the school\ndistrict’s services are unconditionally accepted by the MEA-PAC, the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is not excluded from the definition of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure” under either section of MCFA. Finally, the obvious\nshould be observed, to wit, although the Legislature excluded from the definitions of\n“contribution” and “expenditure” “an offer or tender” of a “contribution or expenditure”\nthat has been rejected, returned, or refunded, there is no similar exclusion for\n“reimbursements,” an exclusion that should be thought to have been obvious, if genuinely\nintended. Justice HATHAWAY nonetheless intuits from the “reject or return” exception\nthat “contribution” in MCL 169.204(1) “clearly requires . . . a net transfer of value . . . .”\nPost at 10-11.\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f169.206(2)(c)-- an enumerated exception to the statutory definition of “expenditure”--\n\nlacks merit for two reasons.      First, a school district’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction plan is not excluded from the definition of an “expenditure” under that section\n\nbecause a “public body,” such as a school district, is not authorized to create a separate\n\nsegregated fund under MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion\n\nfrom the definition of an “expenditure.” Second, even if a “public body” is entitled to\n\nrely on this exclusion, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\ndoes not fall within the statutory exception because the school district’s “expenditure”\n\ncannot be characterized as “[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.” As\n\nalso previously discussed, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction\n\nsystem is a prohibited “contribution.” However, Justice HATHAWAY reasons that the\n\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute a\n\n“contribution.” This latter aspect of her opinion warrants further discussion.\n\n       (a) In circular fashion, Justice HATHAWAY would hold that the definition of\n\n“contribution” encompasses the term “expenditure” and, thus, because the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute an\n\n“expenditure,” it also cannot be a “contribution.” Justice HATHAWAY then states that\n\n“[t]he only other way that the administration of the system could be a ‘contribution’\n\nunder the MCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a ‘transfer of anything\n\nof ascertainable monetary value . . . .’” Post at 8. This assertion is erroneous. As\n\ndiscussed earlier, an “in-kind contribution,” which is a “contribution . . . other than\n\nmoney,” also constitutes a “contribution.” MCL 169.209(3). Similarly, MCFA defines\n\n\n                                            25\n\fas a “contribution” a “payment.” MCL 169.204(1). The school district arguably makes a\n\n“payment” to the MEA-PAC when it transfers money from participating MEA members\n\nto the MEA-PAC. Although in these circumstances the school district only acts as a\n\nconduit, a “contribution” made at the direction of another person “shall be regarded as an\n\nexpenditure or contribution attributable to both persons for purposes of expenditure or\n\ncontribution limits.” MCL 169.270.20\n\n       (b) Justice HATHAWAY further errs, in our judgment, as did the former majority\n\nopinion, by concluding that her interpretation is necessary to avoid absurd results. In\n\ndiscussing whether the administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes a “transfer\n\nof anything of ascertainable monetary value” and thus a “contribution,” Justice\n\nHATHAWAY states:\n\n               There are two possible interpretations of the word “transfer” in the\n       statute. The first interpretation would require that any conveyance of value\n       for services provided to a campaign, regardless of whether the services are\n       paid for, would constitute a contribution. The second would require a net\n       conveyance of value in order to be a “transfer of anything of ascertainable\n       monetary value.” I believe that the latter is the only logical interpretation.\n\n20\n  Justice CAVANAGH asserts that MCL 169.270 does not apply in this case “because an\nMEA member is not seeking to circumvent the MCFA’s contribution limits,” post at 8.\nHowever, MCL 169.270 contains no subjective component. That is, regardless of\nwhether any MEA member has a desire to “circumvent” MCFA’s contribution limits, a\n“contribution or expenditure which is controlled by, or made at the direction of, another\nperson . . . shall be regarded as an expenditure or contribution attributable to both persons\nfor purposes of expenditure or contribution limits.” MCL 169.270. Because the statute is\napplicable, and because a public body is absolutely prohibited from making a\n“contribution” for political purposes under MCL 169.257(1), the only logical inference is\nthat the “contribution limit” for a public body is zero. Therefore, when the school district\nfacilitates an MEA member’s “contribution” and that “contribution” is attributable to the\nschool district pursuant to MCL 169.270, the school district as a public body has\nsurpassed its “contribution limit.”\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       Any other interpretation of “contribution” would lead to an absurd result,\n       and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results. For example,\n       under the majority’s interpretation, a print shop that sells signage to a\n       campaign in the normal course of business would be making a contribution\n       to the campaign because it has transferred something of monetary value to\n       the campaign, even though the shop has been compensated for the cost of\n       providing the signage. Such an interpretation of “contribution” defies\n       common sense, and I do not read the statute in this manner. [Post at 9-10\n       (citations omitted).]\n\nBy emphasizing that her interpretation is necessary to avoid “absurd results,” Justice\n\nHATHAWAY appears to concede that the more natural interpretation of the law is that\n\nasserted by this majority opinion. Resort to an “absurd results” analysis is generally\n\nnecessary only to avoid an interpretation that would otherwise flow from a statute by the\n\napplication of traditional principles of interpretation.\n\n       In essence, Justice HATHAWAY believes that it is necessary to read MCL\n\n169.204(1) as if it referred to a “net transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue,” which it does not, in order to avoid the allegedly “absurd result” to which our\n\ninterpretation of MCL 169.204(1) would lead. What is this allegedly “absurd result”?\n\nWhat is this result that is “quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended”?\n\nPub Citizen v United States Dep’t of Justice, 491 US 440, 471; 109 S Ct 2558; 105 L Ed\n\n2d 377 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring). What is this result that is “unthinkable” or\n\n“bizarre”? Green v Bock Laundry Machine Co, 490 US 504, 527; 109 S Ct 1981; 104 L\n\nEd 2d 557 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring). What is this result that “cannot rationally . . .\n\nmean” what it seems to mean? Id. at 528.21 That there be no exchanges of value between\n\n\n21\n   Although I continue to abide by an “absurd results” rule-- albeit a vastly different\n“absurd results” rule than that of the dissenting justices-- Chief Justice YOUNG, who joins\nthis opinion, does not. See People v McIntire, 461 Mich 147, 152-160; 599 NW2d 102\n\n\n                                              27\n\fa “public body” and a partisan political action committee? That the government not\n\nfurther the partisan interests of a political action committee? That taxpayer resources not\n\nbe employed to collect, and facilitate, partisan political contributions?     While these\n\nresults may be “absurd” to the dissenting justices, we do not find them to be “absurd” at\n\nall.   Once again, the dissenting justices seem to equate an absurd result with a\n\ndisagreeable result. Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55, 84-86; 718 NW2d\n\n784 (2006) (MARKMAN, J., concurring); Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 370;\n\n773 NW2d 564 (2009) (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the specific “absurd\n\nresult” alleged here by Justice HATHAWAY, that a print shop could not sell signs to a\n\ncampaign because this would constitute a “contribution,” is itself absurd. A print shop is\n\nnot a “public body” and therefore, unlike a school district, is not regulated by § 57 of\n\nMCFA.\n\n       (c) The former majority opinion also erred when it concluded that MCL 408.477\n\nof the wages and fringe benefits act provides authority for the school district to\n\nadminister the payroll deduction plan.22 Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 38 n 29. “[S]chool\n\n\n\n(1999); cf. Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55, 78-80, 84-86; 718 NW2d 784\n(2006) (MARKMAN, J., concurring).\n22\n   We recognize that this argument is now absent from Justice HATHAWAY’s dissenting\nopinion. Nonetheless, it is a part of the former majority opinion under reconsideration\ntoday. Apparently, § 7 of the wages and fringe benefits act, MCL 408.477, provided\nauthority for the school district to administer the payroll deduction plan on December 29,\n2010, but not any longer. Given that Justice HATHAWAY now seems to agree with the\nmajority that the wages and fringe benefits act does not provide authority for the district\nto administer the deduction plan, does she now have an alternative analysis concerning\nfrom where this authority derives?\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fdistricts and school officers have only such powers as the statutes expressly or impliedly\n\ngrant to them.” Jacox v Van Buren Consol Sch Dist Bd of Ed, 293 Mich 126, 128; 291\n\nNW 247 (1940). “‘The extent of the authority of the people’s public agents is measured\n\nby the statute from which they derive their authority, not by their own acts and\n\nassumption of authority.’” Sittler v Mich College of Mining & Technology Bd of Control,\n\n333 Mich 681, 687; 53 NW2d 681 (1952) (citation omitted). Contrary to the former\n\nmajority opinion, the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan for a political\n\naction committee is not expressly or impliedly granted to schools by any statute.\n\n       While MCL 408.477 of the wages and fringe benefits act refers to payroll\n\ndeductions, it does not authorize school districts to administer payroll deductions for\n\npolitical action committees. MCL 408.477(1) provides in full:\n\n              Except for those deductions required or expressly permitted by law\n       or by a collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from\n       the wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an\n       employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established by a\n       corporation or labor organization under section 55 of the Michigan\n\n       On this note, Justice CAVANAGH asserts that when MCL 408.477(1) and MCL\n423.209, which grants authority for public employees to engage in collective bargaining,\nare “considered in tandem,” they “‘expressly or impliedly grant’ school districts the\nauthority to enter collective-bargaining agreements that require a school district to\nadminister a payroll deduction plan.” Post at 10. But this analysis is flawed. We have\nno doubt that school districts have the authority to engage in collective bargaining, and\nalso the authority to administer certain types of payroll deduction plans. However, that\nauthority is limited to “engag[ing] in lawful concerted activities . . . .” MCL 423.209\n(emphasis added). The collective-bargaining agreement in this case required the district\nto engage in an activity in violation of MCL 169.257 and thus cannot serve as the source\nof authority to make a “contribution or expenditure.” By contrast, we have no doubt that\na school district has the authority under the law to administer 401(k) contributions, social\nsecurity and Medicare deductions, and payroll deductions for the payment of union dues\nand service fees.\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f       campaign finance act, Act No. 388 of the Public Acts of 1976, being\n       section 169.255 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, without the full, free, and\n       written consent of the employee, obtained without intimidation or fear of\n       discharge for refusal to permit the deduction.[23]\n\nFrom this provision, the former majority opinion summarily concluded that, “under the\n\nplain language of MCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to administer a payroll\n\ndeduction plan that contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA enters into a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement that expressly permits the deductions.” Mich Ed Ass’n,\n\n488 Mich at 38 n 29.        This is another example of the former majority opinion’s\n\nmisinterpretation of a statute. MCL 408.477 has absolutely nothing to do with whether a\n\n“public body” may administer a payroll deduction plan for the benefit of the MEA-PAC.\n\nRather, the statute describes the approval required for an employer to deduct a portion of\n\nan employee’s wages and states that in order to deduct wages from an employee, the\n\nemployer must obtain the employee’s voluntary consent. The statute also provides that\n\nsuch consent is not required when the wage deduction is expressly permitted by law or by\n\na collective-bargaining agreement. The most that can be discerned from this statute as it\n\npertains to the instant case is that, if the school district is to deduct wages from its\n\nemployees, it must obtain the employees’ voluntary consent unless the deduction is\n\nexpressly permitted by law or a collective-bargaining agreement. However, neither MCL\n\n408.477 nor any other statute provides authority for a “public body” to administer a\n\npayroll deduction plan that contributes money to a political action committee. Therefore,\n\neven if the school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan did not constitute a\n\n23\n  See also MCL 169.255(6) (regulating the manner in which contributions for a separate\nsegregated fund may be obtained).\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\f“contribution” or an “expenditure,” which it clearly does, the school district would still\n\nlack the authority to administer such a plan because no statute gives the school district\n\nthis authority and the school district only has the authority granted to it by statute.\n\nIndeed, as explained earlier, the Legislature has affirmatively and expressly forbidden a\n\nschool district, or any other public body, from making a “contribution or expenditure” to\n\na political action committee.\n\n                        VI. JUSTIFICATION FOR REHEARING\n\n       The dissenting justices assert, explicitly or implicitly, that this opinion undoes\n\ntheir opinion of December 29, 2010, upon rehearing without offering any new\n\njustification for doing so other than the views expressed in the dissent from that opinion.\n\nSee post at 1 (HATHAWAY, J., dissenting), and post at 1 n 1 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n\nFor the benefit of the dissenting justices, we will attempt to provide this justification.\n\n       First, contrary to Justice HATHAWAY’s assertion, we respectfully disagree that the\n\nprevious majority opinion “followed the language of the law.” Post at 2. Indeed, we\n\nbelieve that opinion to have interpreted MCFA in a manner that bore little resemblance to\n\nits actual language. The previous majority opinion (a) effectively inserted words into the\n\nlaw that are absent from the law, e.g., construing the “transfer of anything of\n\nascertainable monetary value,” to require that there be a “transfer of anything of net\n\nascertainable monetary value,” see Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 36, (b) effectively altered\n\nwords in the law, e.g., substituting for “ascertainable monetary value” “ascertained”\n\nmonetary value, id. at 37, (c) applied the facts to the law in an implausible fashion, e.g.,\n\nasserting that the administration of the payroll deduction plan was not done for the\n\n“‘purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the\n\n\n                                              31\n\fqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,’” id., quoting MCL 169.204(1), (d)\n\nmischaracterized the facts, e.g., asserting that the administration of the payroll deduction\n\nplan by the school constituted no “transfer of ascertainable monetary value” to the MEA-\n\nPAC but “merely allow[ed] someone else to make a contribution,” Mich Ed Ass’n, 488\n\nMich at 37, (e) failed to analyze relevant and determinative provisions of the law, e.g.,\n\nthe definition of an “in-kind contribution,” (f) paraphrased the law in an imprecise\n\nmanner, e.g., summarizing an exception to the law’s broad prohibition that is applicable\n\nto the administration of a separate segregated fund or independent committee as one\n\napplicable to the administration of contributions, id. at 29-30, and (g) overlooked words\n\nof the law, e.g., asserting that because the administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\ndoes not constitute an “expenditure,” the “only other way” that it could constitute a\n\n“‘contribution’” would be if a “‘transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value’”\n\nresulted, id. at 34, quoting MCL 169.204(1), despite the fact that MCFA defines a\n\n“contribution” in other ways to include “a payment” or an “in-kind contribution.”\n\n       Second, while the dissenting opinions make light of the fact that we supposedly\n\nhave little justification for this new opinion other than the views expressed in the dissent\n\nfrom the original opinion, we believe that such a justification is actually rather\n\ncompelling. That is, we believe that the previous dissent was in accordance with the\n\nlanguage and intent of MCFA, while the previous majority opinion was not,24 and as\n\n24\n   Justice CAVANAGH claims that we fail to “realize that [his] interpretation of the MCFA\nis consistent” with the purpose of MCL 169.257. Post at 16. This is a rather remarkable\nproposition. If the purpose of MCL 169.257 is, as we believe it to be, to mandate the\nseparation of the government from politics, then it would seem that Justice CAVANAGH’s\ninterpretation, which permits the use of public resources in support of partisan political\n\n\n                                            32\n\fbetween an analysis of the law that is in accordance with its language and intent and one\n\nthat is not, we prefer the former.\n\n       Third, we “justify” granting the motion for rehearing, and reconsidering our\n\nprevious decision, because we believe that the issue before the Court is one of\n\nconsiderable importance to the people of this state and to the integrity of the state’s\n\npolitical and public processes. Through MCFA, the people have sought to maintain a\n\nseparation of politics and the government in order to maintain governmental neutrality in\n\nelections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used\n\nto subsidize partisan political activities. The previous majority opinion, and the present\n\ndissenting opinions, would dismantle this separation. They would increasingly involve\n\nthe taxpayer in the subsidization of partisan political activities and increasingly erode the\n\nneutrality of public institutions in these same activities. While the dissenting justices\n\nseem very little moved by these concerns, we believe that they are substantial. It should\n\nbe a matter of great pride to the people of Michigan that its history, with very few\n\nexceptions, has been a history characterized by electoral fair play and an honest political\n\nprocess. Both parties, and their supporters, can take credit for this history. We believe\n\nthat the people of this state understand well the importance to this history of a legal\n\nsystem in which parties and political action committees cannot commandeer taxpayer\n\nresources and in which government cannot place a thumb on the scale concerning who\n\nwill prevail in the political process. In short, we believe that the people understand well,\n\nactivity, is the antithesis of that purpose. That is, MCL 169.257 prohibits the use of\npublic resources in aid of partisan political activity, and Justice CAVANAGH’s\ninterpretation permits it.\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\ffor it is at the root of MCFA, that to breach these principles is incompatible with a\n\ngovernment that is “instituted for . . . [the] equal benefit . . . and protection” of the\n\npeople. Const 1963, art 1, § 1.\n\n       Finally, we believe that the former majority’s remarkable treatment of this case\n\nitself constitutes grounds for granting rehearing. This case was alternately subject to\n\nunprecedentedly dilatory treatment and unprecedentedly accelerated treatment.            See\n\nMich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 64-68 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). Before this case was\n\nheard in November of last year, it was subject to the lengthiest delay, by far, of any of the\n\n280 cases considered under the procedures of MCR 7.302(H)(1), which authorize this\n\nCourt to order oral argument before deciding whether to grant leave to appeal. See also\n\nn 4 of this opinion. Subsequently, after finally granting leave to appeal and hearing oral\n\narguments, a majority opinion was prepared in near-record time, the period for dissenting\n\njustices to respond to this opinion was substantially shortened, and, in December, these\n\nopinions issued in what approached, if not exceeded, record time for a major decision of\n\nthis Court.\n\n                                   VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       MCL 169.257 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to make a\n\n“contribution or expenditure” for political purposes.      Through administration of the\n\npayroll deduction plan in this case, remitting payments to the MEA-PAC, the school\n\ndistrict makes both a “contribution” and an “expenditure” as defined by MCFA. The\n\nMEA-PAC’s offer to reimburse the school district for expenses incurred in its\n\nadministration of the plan does not remedy an otherwise clear violation of MCL 169.257.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but also with\n\n\n                                             34\n\fthe evident purpose of MCL 169.257, which is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities.

(concurring).\n         I concur in Justice MARKMAN’s opinion granting the motion for rehearing,\n\nvacating this Court’s opinion of December 29, 2010, and affirming the Court of Appeals’\n\njudgment of August 28, 2008. I write separately to emphasize, once again, that granting\n\na rehearing motion is not limited to cases in which new legal arguments were presented\n\nto the Court and to clarify that this is not a case in which it can fairly be said that\n\n“precedent” has been disturbed.\n\n         As Justice ZAHRA recently explained in detail in Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v\n\nDep’t of Environmental Quality,1 MCR 7.313(E) governs motions for rehearing in this\n\nCourt. It is a discretionary rule because it does not contain a standard governing when\n\nwe should grant a motion for rehearing.2 The rule does not limit our discretion to grant\n\n1\n  Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v Dep’t of Environmental Quality, 489 Mich 884, 885\n(2011) (ZAHRA, J., concurring).\n2\n    Id. at 885-886.\n\frehearing to only those cases in which a party has presented new legal arguments.3 The\n\nrule’s lack of any language limiting our discretion supports the principle that, in\n\naddressing a motion for rehearing, it is appropriate for each justice to individually\n\ndetermine whether this Court properly interpreted and applied the law in the case before\n\nthe Court for rehearing.4 As Justice ZAHRA observed in Anglers, other members of this\n\nCourt have voted to grant rehearing and overturn precedent, applying this principle, albeit\n\nwithout explicit recognition of the discretion afforded by the rule.5\n\n         I also share the view articulated by Justice ZAHRA in Anglers that in addition to\n\nconsidering whether the matter was previously decided correctly under the governing\n\nlegal principles, the jurisprudential significance of the legal issues presented should also\n\nbe considered when deciding a motion for rehearing.6 It is only with careful review of\n\nthis Court’s prior rulings that I approach a decision on a motion for rehearing.\n\n         In this case I agree, first, with the legal analysis of the provisions of the Michigan\n\nCampaign Finance Act (MCFA)7 at issue set forth in Justice MARKMAN’s opinion. The\n\npublic school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is both a\n\n“contribution” and an “expenditure” for political purposes under the MCFA, which\n\n3\n    Id. at 887.\n4\n    See id.\n5\n Id. at 888, citing United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims\nAss’n (On Rehearing), 484 Mich 1; 795 NW2d 101 (2010); Duncan v Michigan, 488\nMich 957 (2010) (DAVIS, J., concurring); McCready v Hoffius, 459 Mich 1235 (1999).\n6\n    See Anglers, 489 Mich at 889.\n7\n    MCL 169.201 et seq.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fviolates MCL 169.257(1). Justice HATHAWAY’s position that “nothing in the plain\n\nlanguage of MCL 169.257(1) prohibits a school district from administering a payroll\n\ndeduction system that allows [MEA] members to automatically send contributions to\n\nthe . . . MEA-PAC”8 misconstrues the MCFA.\n\n         Second, this case plainly involves issues of substantial jurisprudential importance\n\nto our state. This case concerns “the separation of the government from politics in order\n\nto maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and\n\nprevent taxpayer funds from . . . subsidiz[ing] partisan political activities.”9 The legality\n\nof the administration of the payroll deduction plan is of considerable public interest given\n\nthat the plan would have essentially allowed taxpayers to help fund a political action\n\ncommittee. Moreover, the case involved an issue of first impression that is not likely to\n\nreappear before the Court on a regular basis. Through the MCFA, the Legislature\n\nintended to keep public resources out of the political process, and the statute could not\n\nmake this plainer.\n\n         Notably, the grant of the rehearing motion, which was timely filed, asked the\n\nCourt to rehear a case that was decided several days before I was sworn in and after the\n\ncase had pended for more than two years in our Court.10 To the extent that this case may\n\n\n8\n    Post at 1.\n9\n Ante at 35.\n10\n  The Court of Appeals issued its opinion in this case on August 28, 2008. The MEA\napplied for leave to appeal on October 8, 2008. On May 8, 2009, this Court ordered oral\nargument on the application. Nearly six months later, on November 5, 2009, this Court\nheard oral argument on the application. Approximately seven months later, on June 4,\n2010, this Court granted the MEA’s application for leave to appeal. Then, three days\n\n\n                                              3\n\fbe deemed to be precedent, its precedential value is de minimis, at best. As noted by\n\nJustice MARILYN KELLY in Petersen v Magna Corp, “[s]tare decisis attempts to balance\n\ntwo competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and\n\ndecisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.”11 In Robinson v Detroit,12 this\n\nCourt set forth four factors to be considered before this Court overrules a previously\n\ndecided case. The purpose of enunciating these factors was to ensure that respectful\n\nconsideration would be given to the cases decided by our predecessors before such cases\n\nare overruled. “The first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was\n\nwrongly decided.”13       Consistently with Justice MARILYN KELLY’s explanation in\n\nPetersen14 of the competing considerations that the doctrine of stare decisis attempts to\n\nreconcile, the remaining three factors balance the need to correct error against the desire\n\nfor stability and reliability in the law. Specifically, the Court observed that it should also\n\nreview “whether the decision at issue defies ‘practical workability,’ whether reliance\n\ninterests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no\n\nlonger justify the questioned decision.”15 When a case is considered on rehearing, none\n\n\nbefore the composition of the Court was set to change, the prior majority entered an\nopinion on December 29, 2010, more than two years after the MEA applied for leave to\nappeal.\n11\n     Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 314; 773 NW2d 564 (2009).\n12\n     Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000).\n13\n     Id. at 464.\n14\n     Petersen, 484 Mich at 314.\n15\n     Robinson, 462 Mich at 464 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fof the Robinson factors outweighs the need to issue a legally correct opinion. No\n\nreasonable legal reliance can be placed on an opinion that has not yet ended its\n\nprocedural course, however extended, in our Court. The opinion at issue was only days\n\nold when the composition of the Court changed. The rehearing motion, timely filed,\n\nnecessarily required adjudication by the newly composed Court. As a justice of the Court\n\nwho had not before considered the merits of the underlying claim, it is my constitutional\n\nduty to address the legal merits of the issues presented. Simply put, I would be derelict in\n\nmy duty if I were to give deference to legal reasoning with which I find fault. On\n\nrehearing, this case rises or falls on the merits of the legal claim. Blind allegiance to the\n\nnotion of stare decisis is not appropriate and is a wholly unpersuasive rationale for\n\nallowing a days-old decision to stand.\n\n       In sum, rehearing was warranted in this case because, in my view, the MCFA\n\nplainly requires holding that the public school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is both an “expenditure” and a “contribution” that violates the act and the\n\nissue was both properly before the Court for rehearing and a matter of substantial\n\njurisprudential significance to our state.\n\n\n                                                         Mary Beth Kelly\n                                                         Brian K.

(dissenting).\n       I disagree with the current majority’s decision to grant respondent’s motion for\n\nrehearing and vacate this Court’s December 29, 2010, majority opinion. Mich Ed Ass’n v\n\nSecretary of State, 488 Mich 18; 793 NW2d 568 (2010).1 Furthermore, I disagree with\n\nthe current majority’s substantive analysis in this case because, in my view, the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at issue is neither a “contribution”\n\nnor an “expenditure” as defined in the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA);\n\ntherefore, the school district’s administration of the plan is not prohibited by MCL\n\n169.257(1). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n1\n  As I explained in my dissenting statement in Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v Dep’t of\nEnvironmental Quality, 489 Mich 884, 891 n 1 (2011), the court rules and this Court’s\ninternal operating procedures imply that MCR 2.119(F)(3) should factor into this Court’s\nconsideration of motions for rehearing. Accordingly, because respondent presents no\nnew arguments in support of her motion for rehearing and the previous majority opinion\nreached the right result for the reasons discussed in this opinion, I would deny\nrespondent’s motion for rehearing.\n\f                               I. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The proper interpretation of a statute is a legal question that this Court reviews de\n\nnovo. Herman v Berrien Co, 481 Mich 352, 358; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).\n\n                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n        The MCFA’s general rule regarding prohibited “contributions” and “expenditures”\n\nis provided in MCL 169.254(1), which states in relevant part:\n\n              Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in . . . [MCL\n        169.255], and to loans made in the ordinary course of business, a\n        corporation, joint stock company, domestic dependent sovereign, or labor\n        organization shall not make a contribution or expenditure . . . .\n\nThus, according to the plain language of MCL 169.254(1), MCL 169.255 is an exception\n\nto the general rule in MCL 169.254(1). That exception states, in relevant part:\n\n               A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint\n        stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization\n        formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make\n        an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n        contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n        A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n        making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n        committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n        political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]\n\nFinally, MCL 169.257(1) specifically addresses how the MCFA applies to “public\n\nbodies,” which includes school districts,2 when it states:\n\n               A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n        or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n        software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n        other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure . . . .\n\n2\n    MCL 169.211(6)(c).\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fThus, under MCL 169.254(1) and MCL 169.257(1), private entities and “public bodies”\n\nare barred from making “contributions” and “expenditures” unless an exception applies.\n\nThe MCFA provides detailed definitions of “contribution” and “expenditure”; therefore,\n\nin order to properly apply the relevant portions of the MCFA to the facts of this case, it is\n\nnecessary to closely consider those statutory definitions to fully understand what\n\nconstitutes a prohibited “contribution” and “expenditure” as defined in the MCFA.\n\n                                 A. “CONTRIBUTION”\n\n       The MCFA defines “contribution” in MCL 169.204(1), which states:\n\n              “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n       expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n       loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n       a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for\n       the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for\n       the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[3]\n\nThis statutory definition can be divided into two portions: (1) a list of actions that could\n\nconstitute a “contribution,” i.e., “a payment, gift, subscription, assessment, expenditure,\n\ncontract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance, loan, or donation of money or\n\nanything of ascertainable monetary value, or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value to a person,” and (2) the purpose for which the actions must be taken in\n\norder to constitute a “contribution,” i.e., “for the purpose of influencing the nomination or\n\nelection of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n3\n  The MCFA also provides a list of exclusions from its definition of “contribution.” See\nMCL 169.204(3)(a) through (c). It is not necessary to consider those exclusions in this\ncase, however, because the plain language of the statutory definition of “contribution”\ndoes not encompass the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at\nissue here.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fStated another way, the statutory definition requires a court to determine (1) whether a\n\nparty’s conduct falls within the list of actions provided and, if so, (2) the purpose for that\n\naction.\n\n          As the majority insists, the list of actions provided in the first portion of the\n\ndefinition of “contribution” arguably could include the school district’s administration of\n\nthe payroll deduction plan. But even accepting arguendo the majority’s conclusion that\n\nthe administration of the plan represents “a transfer of [something] of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value” to the MEA’s political action committee (MEA-PAC), the question\n\nremains whether the school district administers the plan “for the purpose of influencing\n\nthe nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a\n\nballot question.”\n\n          As the previous majority opinion in this case explained,\n\n          a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not an\n          impermissible contribution under the MCFA because the system is not\n          administered “for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n          candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n          When a public body administers a payroll deduction plan, it does not do so\n          in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot question. Rather,\n          administering the plan is one step removed: it merely allows someone else\n          to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a political issue. The\n          public body administers the plan simply because it is required to do so as\n          part of a labor contract between the public body and its employees.\n          Consequently, because a public school’s administration of a payroll\n          deduction system is not done for the purpose of influencing a political\n          issue, the administration of the system is not a contribution under the\n          MCFA. [Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 488 Mich at 37-38 (citation\n          omitted).]\n\nThe majority attempts to counter the previous majority’s explanation of the plain\n\nmeaning of the MCFA’s definition of “contribution” by first claiming that the school\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fdistrict makes a “contribution” because, by administering the payroll deduction plan, it\n\n“provid[es] valuable services to the MEA-PAC in aid and furtherance of its political\n\nactivities.” Ante at 13 n 12. This analysis, however, impermissibly strays from the\n\nstatutory language because it focuses on the arguable result of the school district’s\n\nadministration of the plan rather than the school district’s purpose in administering the\n\nplan, as the statute requires. The fact that, at some remote time in the future, the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan eventually results in the furtherance\n\nof the MEA’s political activities does not necessarily make the school district’s actions a\n\n“contribution” as defined in MCL 169.204(1). Rather, the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is only a “contribution” if, at the time the school district performs the\n\nservice, it does so “for the purpose” of influencing an election.\n\n       Second, the majority argues that, in considering the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan under MCL 169.204(1), the focus should not be on whether\n\nthe school district is attempting to influence a political race, but whether the payment that\n\nit provides is intended for that purpose. While the majority is correct to focus on the\n\n“payment,” the majority confuses the two payments at issue in this case: the MEA\n\nmember’s “payment” in the form of money deducted from his or her paycheck and the\n\nschool district’s arguable “payment” in the form of administering the payroll deduction\n\nplan that transfers the employee’s donation to the MEA-PAC.4 While the employee’s\n\n4\n  The majority further confuses the two payments at issue with its discussion of the\ndefinition of the word “make.” Contrary to the majority’s claims, when the school\ndistrict administers the payroll deduction plan, it does not “‘cause[] to exist or happen’\n‘contributions’ from MEA members . . . .” Ante at 9. Rather, the MEA member “causes\nto exist or happen” the “contribution” when the MEA member voluntarily chooses to\n\n\n                                              5\n\fdonation to the MEA-PAC is likely a “contribution” because it is made “for the purpose”\n\nof influencing a political race, the majority erroneously imputes the employee’s purpose\n\nin making the contribution to the school district.       It is not the purpose behind the\n\nemployee’s donation that is the focus of the relevant inquiry; rather, it is the purpose\n\nbehind the school district’s decision to administer the payroll deduction plan, which\n\nmerely transfers donations from the employee to the MEA-PAC, that must be considered.\n\nSimilarly, the majority erroneously imputes the MEA’s purpose in collecting\n\ncontributions to the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan. See\n\nante at 12 (claiming that the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\nis a “contribution” because “the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate\n\nthe involvement of the MEA in partisan politics”). What the majority fails to grasp is\n\nthat, when properly applied to this case, MCL 169.204(1) is focused solely on the school\n\ndistrict’s purpose in acting in a specific fashion.\n\n       In order to determine the school district’s “purpose,” one must first define the\n\nword and then apply that definition to the facts of this case. The MCFA does not define\n\n“purpose”; therefore, it is proper to consult a dictionary to assist the Court in determining\n\nthe word’s common meaning. McCormick v Carrier, 487 Mich 180, 195; 795 NW2d 517\n\n(2010); see, also, MCL 8.3a. “Purpose” is defined as “[a] result or effect that is intended\n\n\ndonate to the MEA-PAC. The school district merely transfers money from one place to\nanother. Just as a bank, acting in response to a check written by a customer, does not\n“make” a payment when it transfers money from the customer’s account to the party\nidentified on the check, the school district does not “make” a contribution when it\ntransfers money from a MEA member’s paycheck to the MEA-PAC at the MEA\nmember’s direction.\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\for desired; intention.”   The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition\n\n(1982), def 2 (emphasis added). Thus, in order to determine the school district’s purpose\n\nfor administering the payroll deduction plan, one must consider the school district’s\n\nintent. “Intent,” in turn, is defined as “[t]he state of mind operative at the time of an\n\naction. . . . [h]aving the mind fastened upon some purpose.” Id., defs 2 and 3. Similarly,\n\n“intention” is defined as “[a] plan of action; design” and “[a]n aim that guides\n\naction . . . .” Id., defs 1 and 2. In light of these definitions, in order to determine the\n\nschool district’s purpose as it relates to the statutory definition of “contribution,” one\n\nmust determine the school district’s “aim that guides [its] action” and the “state of mind\n\noperative” when the school district administers the payroll deduction plan.\n\n       As the majority notes, the school district and the MEA entered into a collective-\n\nbargaining agreement, part of which required the school district to administer the payroll\n\ndeduction plan at issue in this case. Because the school district is required by contract to\n\nadminister the payroll deduction plan, the school district’s purpose in administering the\n\nplan is to satisfy its bargained-for contractual duties. The school district’s purpose was\n\nnot to “influenc[e] the nomination or election of a candidate” or “the qualification,\n\npassage, or defeat of a ballot question.” MCL 169.204(1). Therefore, although the\n\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan may, in some tangential or\n\nremote sense, eventually influence an election, that was not the school district’s purpose.\n\nConsequently, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a\n\n“contribution” as defined by the MCFA.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f        The majority also attempts to support its “contribution” analysis with a quotation\n\nfrom MCL 169.270.5 Ante at 26. But, in my view, that statute is intended to prevent an\n\nentity from circumventing the contribution limits in MCL 169.252 and MCL 169.252a by\n\ntransferring money to other entities and then directing those entities to make\n\n“contributions” or directing another entity to use its own resources to make a\n\n“contribution.”   Indeed, the statute expressly states that it applies “for purposes of\n\nexpenditure and contribution limits.” MCL 169.270. Thus, contrary to the majority’s\n\ninterpretation, the statute is focused on enforcing contribution limits, not determining\n\nwhether a particular act is a “contribution” or “expenditure” as defined in MCL 169.204\n\nand MCL 169.206. Notably, because an MEA member is not seeking to circumvent the\n\nMCFA’s contribution limits by making a contribution through the payroll deduction plan,\n\nMCL 169.270 is not applicable to the school district in this case. The MEA member does\n\nnot “control” a “contribution” made by the school district or “direct” the school district to\n\nmake a contribution from the school district’s own funds. Rather, the MEA member\n\nmakes a contribution out of his or her own funds, and the school district merely transfers\n\nthose funds. Throughout the entire transaction, the contribution is always attributable to\n\nthe MEA member.\n\n\n5\n    MCL 169.270 states:\n\n               A contribution or expenditure which is controlled by, or made at the\n        direction of, another person, including a parent organization, subsidiary,\n        division, committee, department, branch, or local unit of a person, shall be\n        reported by the person making the expenditure or contribution, and shall be\n        regarded as an expenditure or contribution attributable to both persons for\n        purposes of expenditure or contribution limits.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f        Furthermore, by claiming that the school district exceeds its inferential\n\ncontribution limit of zero when it administers the payroll deduction plan, the majority\n\nonce again improperly imputes to the school district the MEA member’s purpose for\n\nmaking the contribution. As this opinion explains, an act is not a “contribution” as\n\ndefined in MCL 169.204(1) unless the act is performed for the specific purpose of\n\n“influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage,\n\nor defeat of a ballot question.” Because the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is not performed for that purpose, the school district does not make a\n\n“contribution” and, thus, does not exceed any arguably applicable contribution limit.6\n\n        Finally, the majority questions the school district’s authority to administer the\n\npayroll deduction plan at issue in this case. However, this concern is misplaced because\n\nschool districts, by statute, have the authority to enter into collective-bargaining\n\nagreements, MCL 423.209,7 and school districts may administer a payroll deduction plan\n\n6\n   The majority also argues that, under MCL 169.209(3), the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is an “in-kind contribution” because the\nadministration of the plan is a “contribution . . . other than money.” But, as the majority\nseems to accept, under the plain language of MCL 169.209(3), the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan cannot be an “in-kind contribution” unless it\nis a “contribution” as defined in MCL 169.204(1). Thus, because I believe that the\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a “contribution” for\nthe reasons previously provided, it is also not an “in-kind contribution.”\n7\n    MCL 423.209 states:\n\n                It shall be lawful for public employees to organize together or to\n        form, join or assist in labor organizations, to engage in lawful concerted\n        activities for the purpose of collective negotiation or bargaining or other\n        mutual aid and protection, or to negotiate or bargain collectively with their\n        public employers through representatives of their own free choice.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fas part of a collective-bargaining agreement pursuant to the wages and fringe benefits act,\n\nspecifically MCL 408.477(1). Thus, in the abstract, the majority’s argument that the\n\nwages and fringe benefits act does not directly grant school districts the authority to\n\nadminister a payroll deduction plan is correct, but the majority errs when it concludes that\n\nthe wages and fringe benefits act is irrelevant to this case. Rather, when that act is\n\nconsidered in tandem with MCL 423.209, the statutes “expressly or impliedly grant”\n\nschool districts the authority to enter collective-bargaining agreements that require a\n\nschool district to administer a payroll deduction plan. Jacox v Van Buren Consol Sch\n\nDist Bd of Ed, 293 Mich 126, 128; 291 NW 247 (1940). Because the school district’s\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is neither a “contribution” nor an\n\n“expenditure” for the reasons discussed in this dissent, administration of the plan does not\n\nviolate MCL 169.257 and, thus, is lawful.\n\n                                  B. “EXPENDITURE”\n\n       Although the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a\n\nprohibited “contribution,” it could nevertheless be barred under MCL 169.257 if it meets\n\nthe statutory definition of “expenditure.”         Therefore, that definition must also be\n\nexamined in the context of this case.         The MCFA defines “expenditure” in MCL\n\n169.206(1), which states, in relevant part:\n\n             “Expenditure” means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of\n       payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods,\n       materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n\n\nSee, also, MCL 423.217(1) (protecting collective-bargaining agreements of public school\nemployees).\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or\n       defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any\n       of the following:\n\n             (a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n       monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n       candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\nThe MCFA, however, also expressly excludes some conduct that would otherwise meet\n\nits general definition of “expenditure.” Notably, MCL 169.206(2) states, in relevant part:\n\n              Expenditure does not include any of the following:\n\n                                          * * *\n\n               (c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n       solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n       committee.\n\n       The majority argues that the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is barred by the MCFA because it is an “expenditure” under the general\n\ndefinition in MCL 169.206(1) and the exclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) does not apply to\n\npublic bodies. The majority concludes that the “exclusion is clearly designed to apply\n\nonly to corporations and labor organizations that possess the authority to create, establish,\n\nadminister, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place.”             Ante at 15.\n\nFurthermore, the majority claims that MCL 169.257 and MCL 169.254 apply to public\n\nbodies and private entities respectively the same general rule barring “expenditures,” but,\n\nbecause MCL 169.257 does not refer to the exception in MCL 169.255 permitting some\n\ntypes of “expenditures,” MCL 169.257 represents an “absolute prohibition” against\n\nexpenditures by public bodies. I disagree with the majority’s analysis.\n\n       To begin with, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, neither the general definition\n\nof “expenditure” in MCL 169.206(1) nor the exclusion from the general definition in\n\n\n                                             11\n\fMCL 169.206(2)(c) indicates that the exclusion only applies to private entities. Thus,\n\nthere is simply no basis in the statutory language to support the majority’s position.\n\n       Likewise, nothing in MCL 169.257 supports the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nexclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) from the definition of “expenditure” does not apply to\n\npublic bodies. While the majority is correct that the exceptions in MCL 169.255 do not\n\napply to public bodies, that fact does not support the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nexclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) also does not apply with equal force to public bodies. In\n\nfact, the majority’s claim that this exclusion is “plainly directed toward elaborating on\n\n[MCL 169.255] by making clear that no expenditures authorized by [MCL 169.255] for\n\nthe establishment of a separate segregated fund will be treated as a prohibited\n\nexpenditure,” ante at 16 n 13, leaves no distinction between the two statutes. Therefore,\n\nif the majority were correct that MCL 169.206(2)(c) does not apply to public bodies,\n\nMCL 169.206(2)(c) is completely unnecessary because, under the majority’s\n\ninterpretation, it says the exact same thing as MCL 169.255. The majority’s efforts to\n\nread these two statutes “harmonious[ly]” are strained and renders MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nsuperfluous. I decline to adopt such an interpretation because the result is impermissible\n\nunder the rules of statutory interpretation. People v McGraw, 484 Mich 120, 126; 771\n\nNW2d 655 (2009) (“In interpreting a statute, we avoid a construction that would render\n\npart of the statute surplusage or nugatory.”).\n\n       Rather, I believe that MCL 169.257 explains that public bodies are not to make\n\n“expenditures” as defined in MCL 169.206(1), but if the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan satisfies the exclusion from the definition of “expenditure”\n\nfound in MCL 169.206(2)(c) administration of the plan is not an “expenditure,” and the\n\n\n                                             12\n\fplan does not violate MCL 169.257. Thus, in a sense, the majority is correct that MCL\n\n169.257 creates an “absolute prohibition” against expenditures by public bodies, but the\n\nmajority misses the boat when it concludes that this “absolute prohibition” bars the\n\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at issue in this case.\n\nBecause the school district’s administration of the plan is excluded from the definition of\n\n“expenditure,” there is simply no “expenditure” to prohibit.8\n\n       The majority’s erroneous analysis further results from its insistence that the\n\nexclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) only applies to expenditures for the establishment or\n\nadministration of a separate segregated fund. This interpretation of MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nis misguided because the statutory exclusion focuses on expenditures associated with\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund, not expenditures associated with the creation\n\nor management of a separate segregated fund.\n\n       Specifically, MCL 169.206(2)(c) provides that an “expenditure” does not include\n\n“[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to\n\na separate segregated fund . . . .” The majority errs because it replaces “to” with “of”\n\nand ignores the word “contributions” when considering “establishment” and\n\n8\n  Contrary to the majority’s claims, my interpretation does not permit political action\ncommittees to “commandeer[]” government resources. Ante at 16 n 13. Obviously, a\npublic body is always free to decline the MEA’s or any other organization’s request to\nengage in a plan like the one at issue in this case. Indeed, the school district in this case\nfreely agreed to administer the payroll deduction plan as part of the arm’s-length\nnegotiations with the MEA that culminated in a collective-bargaining agreement. Thus,\nthe MEA did not “commandeer” anything. Furthermore, my interpretation would not\n“always” lead to the same result. Ante at 16 n 13. Rather, a public body would only be\npermitted to engage in the limited conduct excluded from the definition of “expenditure”\nwhen the specific requirements of MCL 169.206(2)(c) are met.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f“administration” as used in MCL 169.206(2)(c). Stated another way, the majority’s\n\nanalysis rewrites the statute as follows: “‘[e]xpenditure’ does not include . . . [a]n\n\nexpenditure for the establishment or administration of a separate segregated fund or\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund . . . .” Therefore, the majority’s\n\ninterpretation impermissibly adds words to the statute. See Hiltz v Phil’s Quality Market,\n\n417 Mich 335, 347; 337 NW2d 237 (1983). Indeed, the majority opinion expressly states\n\nthat “the school district is not making an ‘expenditure’ for the administration of a\n\nseparate segregated fund . . . because . . . the school district is simply administering the\n\npayroll deduction plan . . . .”     Ante at 19 (emphasis altered); see, also, ante at 19\n\n(claiming that MCL 169.206[2][c] supports the majority’s conclusion that “the only\n\nadministrative costs that are excluded under this exclusion are those associated with\n\nadministering a ‘separate segregated fund or independent committee’”). By its own\n\nwords, the majority displays its need to impermissibly change the language of the statute\n\nin order to support its holding.9\n\n       Thus, although I agree with the majority that the school district is not making an\n\n“expenditure” for the administration of a separate segregated fund, that point is irrelevant\n\nbecause that is not what the statutory exclusion requires. Rather, by administering\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Indeed, the majority expressly states, without explanation and contrary to the plain\nlanguage of the statute, that MCL 169.206(2)(c) “does not exclude from the definition of\n‘expenditure’ an ‘expenditure’ for the ‘administration of contributions’; rather it excludes\nan ‘expenditure’ for the administration of a ‘separate segregated fund or independent\ncommittee’ . . . .” Ante at 20 n 15.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fcontributions to a separate segregated fund, the school district’s conduct falls squarely\n\nwithin the statutory exclusion from the general definition of “expenditure.”10\n\n                              C. PURPOSE OF MCL 169.257\n\n       Finally, the majority supports its interpretation of the MCFA by claiming that the\n\npurpose of MCL 169.257 “is to mandate the separation of the government from politics\n\nin order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic\n\nprocesses, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political\n\nactivities,” ante at 6-7, and only its analysis is consistent with that purpose. To begin\n\nwith, the majority’s soaring rhetoric could easily be classified as nothing more than an\n\nimpassioned plea in support of the policy that the majority wishes to impose, see, e.g.,\n\nante at 33, but more importantly, the majority goes well beyond the statutory language in\n\na misguided effort to determine this provision’s purpose.\n\n       Focusing instead on the statutory language alone, it is clear that the purpose of\n\nMCL 169.257 is simply to prevent a public body from using its resources “to make a\n\ncontribution or expenditure” as those words are defined in MCL 169.204 and MCL\n\n\n10\n   The school district’s involvement in the payroll deduction plan can properly be\ndescribed as “[a]n expenditure for the . . . administration . . . of contributions . . . .” MCL\n169.206(2)(c). “Administration” is defined as, among other things, “[t]he management of\naffairs” and “[t]he dispensing, applying, or tendering of something . . . .” The American\nHeritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982), defs 1 and 7. In this case, the\nschool district’s involvement in the payroll deduction plan involves the management and\ndispensing of employees’ contributions to the MEA-PAC. Thus, the common meaning of\nthe words used in the exclusion from the definition of “expenditure” found in MCL\n169.206(2)(c) further support the conclusion that the exclusion applies in this case. The\nmajority appears to agree when it states that the school district’s administration of the\npayroll deduction plan only facilitates contributions to the MEA-PAC. See ante at 20.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f169.206, respectively. The majority fails to realize that my interpretation of the MCFA is\n\nconsistent with the true purpose of MCL 169.257 as determined from the language of that\n\nprovision because the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at\n\nissue in this case is neither a “contribution” nor an “expenditure.”\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n       In my view, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does\n\nnot violate the MCFA because it is neither a “contribution” nor an “expenditure” under\n\nthe statutory definitions of those terms. Because the majority’s substantive analysis in\n\nthis case is the product of its erroneous interpretation of the statutory provisions at issue, I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n                                                           Michael F.

(dissenting).\n         I dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate this Court’s December 29, 2010,\n\nopinion because nothing in the plain language of MCL 169.257(1) prohibits a school\n\ndistrict from administering a payroll deduction system that allows Michigan Education\n\nAssociation (MEA) members to automatically send contributions to the MEA’s political\n\naction committee (MEA-PAC).1 Instead of preserving precedent, this newly comprised\n\nmajority reverses this Court’s previously issued opinion and issues its own opinion for no\n\nreason other than that it disagrees with the outcome of the prior opinion. Moreover,\n\nmembers of the current majority conspicuously fail to explain how this action differs\n\nfrom actions that they vehemently criticized just two short years ago.2 I would preserve\n\n\n\n1\n    The MEA-PAC is a segregated fund under MCL 169.255.\n2\n    Recall the words of now Chief Justice YOUNG just two years ago:\n\fthis Court’s December 29, 2010, opinion, which followed the language of the law,\n\nbecause a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system that remits funds\n\nto a segregated fund is not precluded by MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.\n\n                                       I. ANALYSIS\n\n         At issue is whether § 57 of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA), MCL\n\n169.257(1),3 prohibits a public school from administering a payroll deduction system that\n\nremits funds to the MEA-PAC. To interpret the MCFA, we must follow the established\n\nrules of statutory construction. “Assuming that the Legislature has acted within its\n\nconstitutional authority, the purpose of statutory construction is to discern and give effect\n\nto the intent of the Legislature.”4 Accordingly, a Court must interpret the language of a\n\nstatute in a manner that is consistent with the legislative intent.5     In determining the\n\nlegislative intent, the actual language of the statute must first be examined.6 “As far as\n\n\n                The facts have not changed. The text of the statute at issue has not\n         changed. The parties’ arguments have not changed. And the rationale\n         advanced in the opinions of this Court has not changed. Yet, within a\n         matter of months, a decision of this Court, thoughtfully briefed, argued, and\n         considered by seven justices, is no longer worth the paper it was written on.\n         Even the casual observer, however, does not really need to ask why. The\n         reason is obvious: . . . the composition of this Court changed.

EXPENDITURE\n\n      The first issue is whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem that remits funds to the MEA-PAC is an impermissible “expenditure” under § 57.\n\n“Expenditure” is specifically defined in the MCFA. The definition of “expenditure” is\n\nset forth in MCL 169.206, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n              (1) “Expenditure” means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of\n      payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods,\n      materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n      nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or\n      defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any\n      of the following:\n\n            (a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n      monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n      candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n                                        * * *\n\n             (2) Expenditure does not include any of the following:\n\n             (a) An expenditure for communication by a person with the person’s\n      paid members or shareholders and those individuals who can be solicited\n      for contributions to a separate segregated fund under [MCL 169.255].\n\n                                        * * *\n\n              (c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n      solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n      committee.

It includes a payment, donation,\n\nloan, or promise of payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for\n\ngoods, materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n\nnomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot\n\nquestion.     The definition also includes a contribution or a transfer of anything of\n\nascertainable monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. However, MCL\n\n169.206(2) also expressly excludes items from being classified as expenditures even\n\nthough they may qualify under the general definition outlined in MCL 169.206(1).\n\nNotably, any “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee” is specifically\n\nexcluded from the definition of “expenditure” by MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n\n         Turning to the facts of this case, the administration of a payroll deduction system\n\ndoes arguably provide services to the MEA and the MEA-PAC in facilitating payroll\n\ndeductions from members by providing personnel and computer services. The system\n\nallows MEA members to authorize the school to automatically deduct money from their\n\npaychecks and remit the funds to the MEA-PAC.               The MEA-PAC is a separate\n\nsegregated fund under MCL 169.255 because it has been established by the MEA, a labor\n\norganization, to make contributions to and expenditures on behalf of candidate\n\ncommittees, ballot question committees, political party committees, political committees,\n\nand independent committees.12 Thus, the payroll deduction system administers member\n\n12\n     MCL 169.255(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fcontributions to a separate segregated fund.          Although this process falls within the\n\ngeneral definition of “expenditure” under MCL 169.206(1), the administration of such a\n\nsystem is explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL 169.206(2)(c),\n\nwhich provides that an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation\n\nof contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee” is not an\n\n“expenditure.”13 A public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system falls\n\nsquarely within the statutory exception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member\n\ncontributions to their separate segregated fund, the MEA-PAC.                   Therefore, the\n\nadministration of the system is not an expenditure under the MCFA.\n\n           The majority erroneously asserts that the school district’s administration of a\n\npayroll deduction system is not an “administration . . . of contributions to a separate\n\nsegregated fund or independent committee”14 because the district is not administering a\n\nfund; rather, the district is only administering the payroll deduction system that remits\n\nfunds to the MEA-PAC. This argument is unfounded and contrary to the plain language\n\nof the statute.       The plain language of the statute applies to the administration of\n\n                  A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint\n           stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization\n           formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make\n           an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n           contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n           A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n           making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n           committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n           political committees, and independent committees.\n13\n     MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n14\n     Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcontributions to a separate segregated fund; the statute does not specify who has to make\n\nthe contributions. The MEA members’ contributions to the MEA-PAC are administered\n\nthrough the payroll deduction system. Thus, the district, by administering the payroll\n\ndeduction system, is administering contributions to the MEA-PAC, an action that is\n\nexplicitly allowed according to the plain language of the statute.\n\n       In sum, administration of a payroll deduction system is an “expenditure for the\n\nestablishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\nfund or independent committee” and thus falls within an enumerated exception to the\n\nstatutory definition of “expenditure.”     Therefore, the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction system is not an “expenditure” as defined by the MCFA and is not prohibited\n\nby § 57 on that ground.\n\n                                  B. CONTRIBUTION\n\n       The next issue is whether administration of the payroll deduction system is an\n\nimpermissible “contribution” under the MCFA. “Contribution,” like “expenditure,” is\n\nspecifically defined by the MCFA. The definition of “contribution” under the MCFA is\n\nset forth in MCL 169.204, which provides:\n\n               (1) “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n       expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n       loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n       a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made\n       for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or\n       for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n              (2) Contribution includes the full purchase price of tickets or\n       payment of an attendance fee for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies,\n       testimonials, and other fund-raising events; an individual’s own money or\n       property other than the individual’s homestead used on behalf of that\n\n\n                                             7\n\f         individual’s candidacy; the granting of discounts or rebates not available to\n         the general public; or the granting of discounts or rebates by broadcast\n         media and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for\n         the same office; and the endorsing or guaranteeing of a loan for the amount\n         the endorser or guarantor is liable.\n\n                (3) Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n                (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n         payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n         individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n         without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n         indirectly, repaid.\n\n               (b) Food and beverages, not to exceed $100.00 in value during a\n         calendar year, which are donated by an individual and for which\n         reimbursement is not given.\n\n               (c) An offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and\n         unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within\n         30 business days after receipt. [Emphasis added.]\n\n         The definition of “contribution” includes the term “expenditure.”            Because\n\n“expenditure” is explicitly defined by the MCFA, the statutory definition controls.15 As\n\nexplained earlier, the administration of a payroll deduction system is not an\n\n“expenditure” under the MCFA and thus cannot be a contribution on that basis. The only\n\nother way that the administration of the system could be a “contribution” under the\n\nMCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a “transfer of anything of\n\nascertainable monetary value . . . made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or\n\nelection of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n         The majority argues that the actual and intangible costs associated with the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system constitute a contribution because there is a\n\n15\n     Tryc, 451 Mich at 136.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\ftransfer of something of ascertainable monetary value from the school district to the\n\nMEA-PAC and the transfer, although made pursuant to a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, is made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The majority\n\nasserts that the resources expended to administer the payroll deduction system have an\n\nascertainable monetary value, and the fact that they are expended for the benefit of the\n\nMEA-PAC conveys value to the MEA-PAC.                  The majority further argues that\n\nprepayment for the services does not negate the transfer because MEA-PAC still receives\n\nthe benefit of the services.\n\n         I disagree with this interpretation of the word “transfer” in the statute. Because\n\n“transfer” is a nontechnical word that is not defined within the statute, the proper course\n\nof action is to first look to the plain meaning of the term to ascertain what the Legislature\n\nintended by using “transfer” to define a “contribution.”16 “Transfer” is defined as “to\n\nconvey or remove from one place, person, etc., to another.”17 In order for there to be a\n\ncontribution, “anything of ascertainable monetary value” must be conveyed from one\n\nentity to another.\n\n         There are two possible interpretations of the word “transfer” in the statute. The\n\nfirst interpretation would require that any conveyance of value for services provided to a\n\ncampaign, regardless of whether the services are paid for, would constitute a\n\n\n16\n MCL 8.3a; Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs v Mich Prop & Cas Guaranty Ass’n, 456\nMich 590, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998).\n17\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fcontribution. The second would require a net conveyance of value in order to be a\n\n“transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value.” I believe that the latter is the only\n\nlogical interpretation. Any other interpretation of “contribution” would lead to an absurd\n\nresult, and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results.18 For example, under the\n\nmajority’s interpretation, a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the normal\n\ncourse of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because it has\n\ntransferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even though the shop has been\n\ncompensated for the cost of providing the signage.             Such an interpretation of\n\n“contribution” defies common sense, and I do not read the statute in this manner.\n\nInstead, I conclude that the statute requires a net conveyance of “anything of monetary\n\nvalue” in order for there to be a campaign contribution. If costs for administering the\n\npayroll deduction system are paid in advance, there is no net conveyance of anything of\n\nmonetary value, and there is no contribution.\n\n         Furthermore, my conclusion that a “contribution” under MCL 169.204(1) requires\n\na net transfer of value comports with the remainder of that section, which specifically\n\nexcludes from the statutory definition of “contribution” any “contribution if expressly and\n\nunconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business\n\ndays after receipt.” MCL 169.204(3)(c). In other words, if the contribution is rejected,\n\nreturned, or refunded, it is no longer a “contribution” under the MCFA. Moreover, MCL\n\n169.204(2) explains that a “contribution” includes “the granting of discounts or rebates\n\nnot available to the general public . . . .” This implies that when an entity provides\n\n18\n     McAuley v Gen Motors Corp, 457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fproducts or services at full price, the entity is not making a contribution. Thus, the statute\n\nclearly requires that there be a net transfer of value in order for there to be a contribution\n\nunder the MCFA.\n\n         The majority erroneously asserts that the payroll deduction system constitutes\n\nsomething of “ascertainable monetary value” because there is inherent value to the MEA-\n\nPAC in having payroll deductions automatically taken from members’ wages as opposed\n\nto requiring individual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. This argument ignores the plain\n\ndefinition of the term “ascertainable.” “Ascertainable” is also a nontechnical word that is\n\nnot defined within the statute, so we must look to the ordinary meaning of the word to\n\ndiscern what the Legislature intended. “Ascertain” is defined as “to find out definitely;\n\nlearn with certainty or assurance.”19 Thus, the phrase “ascertainable monetary value” in\n\nthe statute requires that the monetary value conferred be determined definitely, with\n\ncertainty and assurance. The majority hypothetically opines that the intangible benefits\n\nthe union receives because of the payroll deduction system confers something of\n\nascertainable monetary value. The majority reasons that ascertainable monetary value is\n\nself-evident from the fact that the defendant has bargained for the payroll deduction\n\nsystem in its contract with the school district and has appealed the right to enforce the\n\nprovision in this Court. However, these actions do not definitely identify with certainty\n\nthe amount of monetary value that the payroll deduction system confers to the MEA.\n\nTherefore, according to the terms of the statute, the intangible benefits conferred to the\n\n\n\n19\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fMEA by the administration of a payroll deduction system do not constitute a\n\n“contribution.”\n\n       In this instance, the MEA plans to prepay the school district for all ascertainable\n\ncosts—those which are definitely and certainly identified—associated with the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system, and in fact asked the Secretary of State for\n\na declaratory ruling regarding the costs to be prepaid. Thus, the administration of the\n\npayroll deduction system will not result in a net transfer of anything of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value as all costs will be ascertained and prepaid.\n\n       The majority also erroneously asserts that the payroll deduction system constitutes\n\nan “in-kind contribution” under MCL 169.209(3) as a “contribution . . . other than\n\nmoney.”    Again, the majority identifies the hypothetical intangible benefits that the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system confers on the MEA as the impermissible\n\ncontributions. However, this argument ignores that an in-kind contribution must still be a\n\n“contribution” as defined by the statute. The hypothetical intangible benefits are not\n\ncontributions because, as discussed, they do not have an ascertainable monetary value.\n\nThe MEA contemplates prepaying all costs associated with the administration of the\n\ndeduction system that can be ascertained. Accordingly, there is no contribution under the\n\nMCFA, and a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not\n\nprohibited by § 57 on that ground.\n\n                       C. VOLUNTEER PERSONAL SERVICES\n\n       The final issue is whether the administration of the system in question\n\nimpermissibly “provide[s] volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fdefinition of contribution under section 4(3)(a)” of the MCFA. As noted earlier, § 4(3)\n\nprovides:\n\n               Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n                (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n         payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n         individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n         without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n         indirectly, repaid. [MCL 169.204(3).]\n\n         Although such services are thus not considered a contribution for purposes of the\n\nrest of the MCFA, § 57 specifically indicates that public bodies cannot use public\n\nresources to provide volunteer services that are not compensated.             However, the\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction system at issue does not involve volunteer\n\nservices by public employees because the MEA intends to prepay for all services\n\nrendered. Because volunteer services are not defined by the statute, again the proper\n\ncourse of action is to look to the plain meaning of the terms to discern the legislative\n\nintent. “Volunteer” is defined as “a person who performs a service willingly and without\n\npay.”20 Willingness to perform an activity is not enough to fall within the scope of this\n\nsubsection; the activity must also be performed without pay. In this case, the MEA fully\n\nanticipates payment and plans to prepay for any administration costs. As a result, a\n\npublic school’s administration of a payroll deduction system does not “provide volunteer\n\npersonal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section\n\n4(3)(a)” of the MCFA and is not prohibited by § 57 on this final ground. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n20\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997), def 2.\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fadministration of a payroll deduction system by a public school is permitted under the\n\nMCFA.\n\n                                    II. CONCLUSION\n\n       I dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate this Court’s December 29, 2010,\n\nopinion. A public school may administer payroll deductions for its employees who remit\n\nfunds to the MEA-PAC because MCL 169.257(1) only prohibits a public body from\n\nusing public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a\n\ncontribution, and (3) provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\ndefinition of “contribution” under MCL 169.204(3)(a). The administration of the system\n\nat issue does not meet any of those criteria. Thus, the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction system is permitted under the MCFA, and the Court of Appeals erred by\n\nconcluding that it is not. Accordingly, I dissent.\n\n\n                                                     Diane M. Hathaway\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f",

The Michigan\n\n Campaign Finance Act (MCFA) prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to\n\n make a “contribution or expenditure” for political purposes. MCL 169.257(1). At issue\n\n in this case is whether a public school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan\n\n that collects and remits political contributions from its employees to the Michigan\n\n Education Association’s political action committee (MEA-PAC) runs afoul of § 57 of\n\n MCFA, MCL 169.257(1). We hold that it does. Through administration of a payroll\n\fdeduction plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee, a school district\n\nmakes both a “contribution,” because public resources are being used to advance the\n\npolitical objectives of the committee, and an “expenditure,” because public “services”\n\nand “facilities in assistance of” these same political objectives are being provided. Thus,\n\nthe school district’s payroll deduction plan is prohibited by MCL 169.257.             This\n\ninterpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but also with the\n\nevident purpose of § 57, which is to mandate the separation of the government from\n\npolitics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic\n\nprocesses, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political\n\nactivities. Accordingly, we grant the motion for rehearing, vacate the December 29,\n\n2010, decision of this Court, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1\n\n                               I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n\n       Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary,\n\nincorporated labor organization that represents approximately 136,000 members\n\n\n1\n  Concerning Justice HATHAWAY’s reference to now Chief Justice YOUNG’s dissent in\nUnited States Fidelity & Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass’n (On\nRehearing), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27; 795 NW2d 101 (2009) (USF&G), see the Chief Justice’s\nresponse in his concurring opinion in Anglers of the AuSable v Dep’t of Environmental\nQuality, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 885 (2011), the thrust of which was that the majority opinion in\nUSF&G prevailed over his dissent, as is the fate of most dissents.

Justice HATHAWAY would apparently require\nthe majority justices in this case to abide by an entirely different set of legal rules.\n\n\n                                             2\n\femployed by public schools, colleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA-\n\nPAC is a separate segregated political fund established by the MEA in accordance with\n\n§ 55 of MCFA, MCL 169.255.            The MEA-PAC is significantly funded by payroll\n\ndeductions of MEA members who have authorized the deductions. The purpose of the\n\nMEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in politics by\n\nelecting candidates favored by the MEA and by furthering the enactment of MEA\n\nlegislative and executive policy initiatives.\n\n       As a public-employee labor organization, the MEA has entered into collective\n\nbargaining agreements with various public school districts across the state. Some number\n\nof these agreements, including that between the MEA’s locally affiliated Kalamazoo\n\nCounty/Gull Lake Education Associations and the Gull Lake Community Schools (the\n\nschool district), require that a school district administer a payroll deduction plan for the\n\ncontributions of MEA members to the MEA-PAC.                Administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan requires the school district to distribute payroll deduction forms; collect,\n\nenter, and monitor the data of participating MEA members; and record, track, and\n\ntransmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC. In return for these services, the MEA has\n\nproposed to pay all costs that the school district incurs in administering the plan.\n\n       In this case, the school district conditioned acceptance of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement on the MEA obtaining a declaratory ruling concerning the validity of the\n\npayroll deduction plan. Accordingly, on August 22, 2006, the MEA filed a request for a\n\ndeclaratory ruling with respondent, the Secretary of State, to determine whether the\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fschool district could make and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC.2\n\nRespondent ruled that, absent express statutory authority, the school district is prohibited\n\nfrom expending public resources for a payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-\n\nPAC. The MEA appealed to the circuit court, which held that respondent’s ruling was\n\n“arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion,” reasoning that, although the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the plan constitutes an “expenditure” under MCFA, when the\n\ncosts of administering the plan have been reimbursed, “no transfer of money to the MEA-\n\nPAC has occurred, and therefore an ‘expenditure’ has not been made within the meaning\n\nof the MCFA.”\n\n         In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 57 of MCFA\n\nprohibits a “public body,” such as a school district, from using public resources “to make\n\na contribution or expenditure.” According to the Court, the costs associated with the plan\n\nconstitute an “expenditure,” and the reimbursement of such costs does not alter that\n\nconclusion.

The\n\npeople of Michigan have granted the Legislature broad powers to regulate elections.\n\nAmong other things, our Constitution empowers the Legislature to set forth the\n\nqualifications of electors; the time, place, and manner of elections; and limitations on\n\nterms of office. Const 1963, art 2, §§ 1 through 10. Furthermore, Const 1963, art 2, § 4\n\nrequires the Legislature to preserve the integrity of elections, providing in pertinent part:\n\n              The legislature shall enact laws to preserve the purity of elections, to\n       preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective\n       franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee\n       voting.\n\nCharged to preserve the “purity of elections” and to “guard against abuses of the elective\n\nfranchise,” the Legislature enacted MCL 169.257, commonly referred to as § 57 of\n\nMCFA. Section 57 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources “to make a\n\ncontribution or expenditure” for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of\n\na candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The clear\n\npurpose of § 57, as reflected in its language, is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\n\n                                              6\n\fpreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities.5\n\n                                         IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       MCL 169.257(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n       or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n       software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n       other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide\n       volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of\n       contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)].\n\n       There is no question that a school district constitutes a “public body” within the\n\nmeaning of § 57.6 Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether by administering a\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to a political action committee, a school district\n\nmakes a “contribution or expenditure” within the meaning of the same provision. If the\n\nplan does, it is expressly prohibited.\n\n                                   A. “CONTRIBUTION”\n\n       MCL 169.204(1) defines a “contribution” as follows:\n\n\n5\n  See also, e.g., the political activities by public employees act, MCL 15.401 et seq.\n(providing that an employee of the state or local unit of government may not engage in\npolitical affairs during working hours); the Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act,\nMCL 432.201 et seq. (providing that members, employees, or agents of the Michigan\nGaming Control Board may not engage in political activity for the duration of their\nemployment); and Civil Service Rule 1-12.6 (prohibiting state employees from\nparticipating in political activities during working hours).\n6\n   MCFA defines a “public body” to include “[a] county, city, township, village,\nintercounty, intercity, or regional governing body; a council, school district, special\ndistrict, or municipal corporation; or a board, department, commission, or council or an\nagency of a board, department, commissioner, or council.” MCL 169.211(6)(c).\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f             “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n      expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n      loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n      a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for\n      the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for\n      the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[7]\n\nAn “in-kind contribution” is defined as a “contribution . . . other than money.” MCL\n\n169.209(3).\n\n      The school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan that facilitates\n\npayments to the MEA-PAC is prohibited by MCL 169.257(1) because the school district\n\nuses its public resources “to make a contribution” in a variety of ways. First, the school\n\ndistrict employs public resources to administer the plan that allows MEA members “to\n\nmake a contribution.” For example, the school district must use its paper, pens, and\n\ncopiers to develop and execute payroll deduction authorization forms; school personnel\n\nmust collect, enter, and monitor the data of participating MEA members into computers\n\nand accounting software, all of which must be specifically configured to record, track,\n\nand transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; school personnel must then be\n\nprepared to respond to individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to\n\nadjust or correct or withdraw their own deduction authorizations; and this process must\n\nnecessarily involve the use of public office space, equipment, and employee time. Use of\n\nthe school district’s resources to facilitate MEA members’ “contributions” constitutes a\n\nstraightforward violation of MCL 169.257(1). More specifically, § 57(1) prohibits the\n\nschool district from using its resources “to make a contribution.” To “make” pertinently\n\n7\n  The MEA-PAC is a “person” because, as a separate segregated fund, it functions as the\nresult of an organization or group of persons acting jointly. See MCL 169.211(1).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fmeans “to cause to exist or happen[.]” Random House Webster’s College Dictionary\n\n(2000), def 2. The school district “makes” a “contribution” to the MEA-PAC because it\n\n“causes to exist or happen” “contributions” from MEA members that otherwise would\n\nnot be made but for the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan.8\n\n       Second, the school district itself makes a prohibited “contribution” to the MEA-\n\nPAC because its administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes something of\n\n“ascertainable monetary value.” There is inherent value to the MEA-PAC in having\n\npayroll deductions automatically taken from members’ wages as opposed to requiring\n\nindividual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. That there is such “ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue” is self-evident from the very fact that the MEA-PAC has affirmatively sought out\n\nthe assistance of the school district and has litigated to the highest court of this state an\n\nappeal asserting its right to enter into the instant agreement with the school district.\n\nParties do not typically enter into contracts absent a belief that the rights or benefits\n\naccorded them under the contract have some “ascertainable monetary value,” and the\n\ninstant contract seems no different. Such value can almost certainly be identified as the\n\nsum of (a) the additional contributions resulting from the ease of the payroll deduction\n\n8\n  All agree that the MEA members’ “payment” or “donation of money” to the MEA-PAC\nconstitutes a “contribution” under MCL 169.204(1) and that the school district facilitates\nthat “contribution” to the MEA-PAC. However, Justice CAVANAGH asserts that the\nschool district does not employ public resources to “make” the MEA members’\ncontribution because it “merely transfers money from one place to another.” Post at\n6 n 4. This characterization significantly trivializes the nature of the school district’s\nparticipation in the MEA-PAC’s fundraising. As already discussed, to “make” relevantly\nmeans to “cause to exist or happen.” Simply put, if the public resources of the school\ndistrict had not been employed to facilitate the MEA members’ contributions, those\n“contributions” would not have “happened.”\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fprocess compared to a political contribution process in which individual solicitations\n\nmust be undertaken and (b) the reduced administrative and transactional costs of the\n\nformer process compared to the latter process. The MEA obviously prefers the payroll\n\ndeduction process because it is a more efficient, and a more productive, process by which\n\nto secure funding for its political activities. The school district is not incidental to this\n\nprocess, but constitutes an indispensable element.          Without the school district’s\n\ncontracted-for services, some lesser amount of contributions would presumably be raised\n\non behalf of the MEA-PAC, and at a greater cost.9\n\n       Third, the administration of the payroll deduction plan also constitutes an “in-kind\n\ncontribution,” defined by MCL 169.209(3) as a “contribution . . . other than money.”\n\n9\n  Relying on the dictionary definition of “ascertain,” Justice HATHAWAY asserts that the\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not have “ascertainable\nmonetary value” because the monetary benefits conveyed to the MEA-PAC have not\nbeen “determined definitely, with certainty and assurance.” Post at 11. Unfortunately,\nJustice HATHAWAY has defined the wrong word. “Ascertainable” does not mean “to find\nout definitely” or “learn with certainty or assurance,” as Justice HATHAWAY opines,\nbecause that is the definition of “ascertain,” not “ascertainable.” Random House\nWebster’s College Dictionary (2000). Rather, “ascertainable” means “able to be\nascertained.” New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed) (emphasis added).\n\n        While the MEA has not provided this Court with numbers regarding the specific\nbenefits yielded from the district’s administration of the deduction plan, it is safe to say\nthat the additional contributions garnered, and the reduction in administrative and\ntransactional costs, are “able to be ascertained.” In short, if the school district no longer\nautomatically deducted contributions from the paychecks of its employees, the MEA\nwould have to bear the added cost of individually contacting each of its members and\nindividually soliciting contributions from them. Everyone understands that this\nprocedure would be a far more costly, and less effective, way of collecting political\ncontributions than the current procedure. Such a cost is easily “ascertainable,” even if the\nMEA and Justice HATHAWAY are uninterested in calculating it, and thus the cost of direct\nsolicitation that the MEA avoids by the current procedure constitutes a “contribution” as\nMCFA defines it.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fAlthough it is clearly possible to quantify the time spent by employees and the resources\n\nexpended by the school district in administering the deduction plan, and thereby to\n\nascertain the cost of such a “contribution” to the school district, it is more difficult to\n\nquantify the intangible benefits that the MEA receives from the deduction plan.\n\nHowever, it is quite certain that these benefits substantially outweigh the costs to the\n\nschool district, and therefore cannot be calculated simply by reference to the school\n\ndistrict’s costs. The most significant of these is simply the extent of access to a district’s\n\nMEA membership that is afforded the MEA-PAC by the deduction plan. Such access\n\navoids any need on the part of the MEA-PAC to establish its own administrative\n\napparatus for political fundraising, vitiates its need to engage in mailings and alternative\n\nforms of communications with its members, and dispenses with its burden of having to\n\nprocess checks, money orders, or credit cards from contributors, as would be necessary\n\nfor any other solicitor of political contributions. As MEA’s counsel at oral argument\n\nacknowledged, this procedure has proven to be an “effective” means to raise money.\n\nAlmost certainly, the marginal administrative costs of the payroll deduction plan to the\n\nschool district, which already may have in place a mechanism by which taxes and\n\ncharitable contributions can be deducted from employees’ paychecks, will be less than\n\nthe administrative costs of an equivalent plan to the MEA, which does not already have a\n\nsimilar mechanism in place. The difference between these respective costs can fairly be\n\ndescribed as an “in-kind contribution” by the school district to the MEA-PAC, however\n\ndifficult it may be specifically to quantify in dollars. It is a “contribution . . . other than\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fmoney” that is made for the “purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”10\n\n       The services undertaken on behalf of the MEA-PAC are “made for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or\n\ndefeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.204(1), because, as discussed earlier, the purpose\n\nof the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in partisan\n\npolitics.11 Thus, the school district’s administration of the deduction plan constitutes a\n\n\n10\n   Justice HATHAWAY asserts that “this argument ignores that an in-kind contribution\nmust still be a ‘contribution’ as defined by the statute.” Post at 12 (emphasis added).\nThis point is hardly “ignored,” for it constitutes the principal focal point of the instant\nsection. That the administration of the deduction plan not only constitutes a\n“contribution” but also an “in-kind contribution” merely establishes an additional way in\nwhich the school district’s administration of the plan is prohibited by MCFA.\n11\n   The previous majority opinion stated that “[w]hen a public body administers a payroll\ndeduction plan, it does not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot\nquestion.” Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 37. However, that opinion failed to recognize\nthat MCL 169.204(1) defines “contribution” as “a payment . . . made for the purpose of\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or\ndefeat of a ballot question.” (Emphasis added.) As discussed, the school district uses its\npublic resources “to make” the MEA members’ payments. Therefore, the pertinent\nquestion is not whether the “public body” itself is attempting to influence a political race\nor ballot question, but whether payments that result from its administration of the payroll\ndeduction plan are intended for that purpose. It is obvious here that the “payment[s] [are]\nmade for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.” Id. This is the purpose that\nindividual MEA members have in mind when they authorize payments, and it is the\npurpose that the MEA-PAC has in mind when it receives payments from the school\ndistrict. It is equally obvious that the school district itself must be fully cognizant of this\npurpose both when it receives payments from individual MEA members and when it\ndelivers payments to the MEA-PAC. That the school district itself might not care\nwhether such payments will influence a political race or ballot question does not alter the\nfact that the purpose of these payments is to do precisely that.\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f“contribution” as that term is defined by MCL 169.204(1).12 Because the school district\n\nemploys public resources to make this “contribution,” its administration of the deduction\n\nplan is a straightforward violation of § 57 of MCFA.\n\n                                 B. “EXPENDITURE”\n\n      Section 57 of MCFA also prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to\n\nmake an “expenditure.” MCL 169.257(1). An “expenditure” is defined as\n\n      a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of\n      ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in\n      assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate,\n      or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. [MCL\n      169.206(1).]\n\nThe school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-\n\nPAC constitutes a prohibited “expenditure” because the school district directly provides\n\n“services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC. The school district provides\n\n“services” to the MEA-PAC in its administration of the deduction plan by developing and\n\nexecuting payroll deduction authorization forms; by collecting, entering, and monitoring\n\nthe data of MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must be\n\nconfigured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; and by\n\naccommodating individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to adjust or\n\n12\n  The previous majority opinion erred when it concluded that administration of the plan\n“merely allows someone else to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a\npolitical issue,” Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 37, i.e., the MEA member who has\nauthorized the payroll deduction. Instead, the school district itself makes both a\n“contribution” and an “in-kind contribution” by providing valuable services to the MEA-\nPAC in aid and furtherance of its political activities. That is, quite independently of the\ncontributions of individual MEA members, the school district contributes something of\nfurther “ascertainable monetary value” to the MEA-PAC.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fcorrect or withdraw their deduction authorizations. Further, the school district provides\n\n“facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC through the use of public office space and\n\nequipment. These “services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC are, once\n\nagain, made for the purpose of “the nomination or election of a candidate, or the\n\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.206(1), because, as\n\ndiscussed previously, the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the\n\ninvolvement of the MEA in politics, by electing candidates favored by the MEA and by\n\nenacting MEA legislative and policy initiatives. Thus, the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan constitutes an “expenditure” as that term is defined by MCL\n\n169.206(1) and is specifically prohibited.\n\n       Justice HATHAWAY concedes that the school district’s administration of the\n\ndeduction plan “falls within the general definition of ‘expenditure’ under MCL\n\n169.206(1) . . . .” Post at 6. However, she would hold, as would Justice CAVANAGH, that\n\nthe plan also falls within a specific statutory exclusion from the definition of an\n\n“expenditure.” This exception provides that an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n\n\nexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee.” MCL 169.206(2)(c). According to\n\nJustice HATHAWAY, a school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that\n\nremits payments to a political action committee constitutes an “‘expenditure for the\n\nestablishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\nfund or independent committee’” and is, therefore, allowed under § 57. Post at 7,\n\nquoting MCL 169.206(2)(c). However, her analysis overlooks the fact that a “public\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fbody,” such as a school district, is not authorized to establish a separate segregated fund\n\nunder MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion.\n\n       Instead, this exclusion is clearly designed to apply only to corporations and labor\n\norganizations that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate\n\nsegregated funds in the first place. This interpretation, limiting the § 6(2)(c) exclusion to\n\ncorporations and labor organizations, is a necessary implication from the structure of\n\nMCFA for three reasons. First, § 54 of MCFA, MCL 169.254, imposes the same rule,\n\nprohibiting the making of a “contribution or expenditure,” on corporations and labor\n\norganizations that § 57 imposes on public bodies. In pertinent part, § 54 provides:\n\n             Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in . . . section\n       55 [MCL 169.255]. . . a corporation, joint stock company, domestic\n       dependent sovereign, or labor organization shall not make a contribution or\n       expenditure . . . . [MCL 169.254(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n       Second, unlike § 57, § 54 does not constitute an absolute prohibition against\n\nmaking a “contribution or expenditure”; rather, pursuant to § 55,\n\n       [a] corporation organized on a for-profit or non-profit basis, a joint stock\n       company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed\n       under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make an\n       expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n       A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n       making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n       committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n       political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]\n\n       Third, there is no similar counterpart in § 57 that allows a “public body” to make\n\n“an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions\n\nto a separate segregated fund . . . .” Thus, under § 55, the only entities allowed to\n\nestablish a separate segregated fund are corporations, joint stock companies, domestic\n\n\n                                             15\n\fdependent sovereigns, or labor organizations, such as the MEA. Considered together,\n\n§ 55 and the § 6(2)(c) exclusion that permits an “expenditure for the establishment,\n\nadministration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund” provide a\n\nlimited mechanism allowing entities such as the MEA to create, establish, administer, or\n\nfund a separate segregated fund for purposes that would otherwise be disallowed by § 54.\n\nIn contrast, a “public body,” such as a school district, is not entitled to create, establish,\n\nadminister, or fund a separate segregated fund, under § 55 or any other provision, and\n\nthus may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.”13\n\n13\n   Justice CAVANAGH asserts that there is “simply no basis in the statutory language to\nsupport the majority’s position.” Post at 12. As discussed, our position, limiting the\n§ 6(2)(c) exclusion to § 55 entities, such as corporations and labor organizations, is a\nnecessary and logical implication derived from MCFA. In discerning legislative intent,\n“[t]he whole act provides [the] proper ‘frame of reference,’” and each section must be\nconsidered together with other sections. Metro Council No 23, AFSCME v Oakland Co\nProsecutor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2086381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2086381/council-23-v-oakland-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318; 294 NW2d 578 (1980) (citation omitted). The exclusion\nof certain expenditures from the definition of “expenditure” in § 6(2)(c) invokes exactly\nthe same operative language as § 55 and is plainly directed toward elaborating on § 55 by\nmaking clear that no expenditures authorized by § 55 for the establishment of a separate\nsegregated fund will be treated as a prohibited expenditure by § 54. This does not render\n§ 6(2)(c) “superfluous” or “completely unnecessary,” as Justice CAVANAGH claims. Post\nat 12. Rather, as already explained, § (6)(2)(c) serves to underscore, and to make\nexplicit, what is otherwise only implicit in § 55-- that “expenditures” permitted by § 55\nare not otherwise prohibited by § 54.\n\n        Furthermore, if § (6)(2)(c) is interpreted to apply to public bodies, which are not\nauthorized to establish separate segregated funds in the first place, the operative language\nof § 57, which prohibits the use of public resources to subsidize partisan political\nactivities, would be rendered null and void. When a political action committee\ncommandeers the resources of the government to raise political contributions for its own\nbenefit, as occurred here, that conduct could always be categorized under Justice\nCAVANAGH’s interpretation as falling within the § 6(2)(c) exception and rendered\npermissible. Thus, the § 6(2)(c) exception would entirely consume the rule prohibiting\npublic bodies from making “expenditures” for political purposes, and the Legislature\nwould effectively have taken with the right hand what it had just given with the left.\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Even if, as Justice HATHAWAY claims, the § 6(2)(c) exclusion is not limited to\n\n§ 55 entities, her application of the exclusion remains illogical. Justice HATHAWAY\n\nconcludes that although a school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\nconstitutes an “expenditure,” it is nevertheless\n\n       explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL 169.206(2)(c),\n       which provides that an “expenditure for the establishment, administration,\n       or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n       committee” is not an “expenditure.” A public school’s administration of a\n       payroll deduction system falls squarely within the statutory exception. The\n       system is set up to facilitate MEA member contributions to their separate\n       segregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore, the administration of the\n       system is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA. [Post at 6.]\n\nJustice HATHAWAY thus concludes that the administration of a payroll deduction plan\n\nfalls “squarely within the statutory exception.”        Under MCL 169.206(2)(c), an\n\n“expenditure” does not encompass what would otherwise be an “expenditure” for (a)\n\nestablishment of a separate segregated fund or independent committee, (b) administration\n\nof a separate segregated fund or independent committee, or (c) solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee. Thus, in order to\n\n\n\nUnder such an interpretation, § 6(2)(c) would allow the Secretary of State’s office, for\nexample, to solicit contributions to a partisan or special interest political action\ncommittee with each driver’s license renewal communication; it would allow Secretary\nof State employees to administer the political contributions received through this process;\nit would allow Secretary of State facilities and computers to be deployed to make and\nprint relevant informational pamphlets and political action committee materials; and it\nwould allow the Secretary of State’s office to attach the postage for these solicitations.\nThis interpretation cannot conceivably be what the Legislature intended when it enacted\nMCFA. Reading MCFA in its entirety, and in context, it is clear that the Legislature\nintended the § 6(2)(c) exception to apply only to those entities that possess the authority\nto create, establish, administer, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\ffall within the purview of this exception, a “public body” must be engaged in one of these\n\nenumerated activities. In this case, however, the school district is engaged in none.14\n\n       First, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the establishment of a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee because the separate segregated fund,\n\nthe MEA-PAC, has already been established by the MEA. In any event, the school\n\ndistrict could not establish a separate segregated fund in the first place, because that\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Justice CAVANAGH concludes that MCFA excepts from the definition of “expenditure”\nan “expenditure” for the (a) establishment of contributions to a separate segregated fund,\n(b) administration of contributions to a separate segregated fund, and (c) solicitation of\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund. Reading § 6(2)(c) in isolation could support\nhis interpretation; however, reading MCFA in its entirety, in particular after due\nconsideration of MCL 169.255(1), makes clear that the only reasonable interpretation of\n§ 6(2)(c) is that it pertains to the “establishment” or “administration” of a “separate\nsegregated fund” and not the “establishment” or “administration” of “contributions.” See\nSun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1984889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1984889/sun-valley-foods-co-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (“The statutory\nlanguage must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that\nsomething different was intended.”).

State Treasurer v Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1274870\"><a href=\"/opinion/1274870/state-treasurer-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145; 377\nNW2d 703 (1985). Unmistakably, the objective of § 55 is to provide authority for certain\n(private) entities to establish and operate a separate segregated fund, and, in pursuit of\nthis objective, § 55 provides that such entities “may make an expenditure for the\nestablishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\nfund.” As the only legislative authority allowing for the creation of a separate segregated\nfund, the use of the terms “establishment” and “administration” must pertain to the\n“establishment” or “administration” of a “separate segregated fund,” and not to the\n“establishment” or “administration” of “contributions”; otherwise, the ability to establish\nand administer a separate segregated fund could not exist in the first place. And\n§ 6(2)(c), which uses nearly identical language, must be interpreted the same way, “so as\nto produce . . . an harmonious and consistent enactment” of MCFA. Wilson, 423 Mich at\n145.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\fauthority is limited to the entities enumerated in § 55 (corporations, joint stock\n\ncompanies, domestic dependent sovereigns, and labor organizations).\n\n         Second, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the administration\n\nof a separate segregated fund or independent committee because the school district is not\n\n“administering” the MEA-PAC; rather, the school district is simply administering the\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to the MEA-PAC. That is, the school district\n\nmakes no determinations at all concerning amounts of funds to be raised from MEA\n\nmembers or other funding sources; the nature and substance of communications to MEA\n\nmembers and other funding sources about the need and urgency of such contributions; the\n\nidentification of political candidates and causes as beneficiaries of the MEA-PAC, and in\n\nwhat amounts; or strategies for optimizing the impact of MEA-PAC participation in\n\npolitical campaigns and causes. Justice HATHAWAY, however, would hold that the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute dictates that the administration costs at issue are excluded from\n\nthe statutory term “expenditure.” See post at 6. In so asserting, Justice HATHAWAY\n\nmisinterprets the statute, because the only administrative costs that are excluded under\n\nthis exclusion are those associated with administering a “separate segregated fund or\n\nindependent committee.” MCL 169.206(2)(c). That the school district is administering a\n\nprocess by which payments are remitted to such a fund is hardly the equivalent of\n\nadministering the fund itself, such that the § 6(2)(c) exclusion would apply. Justice\n\nHATHAWAY is confused in this regard.15\n\n15\n     Justice HATHAWAY asserts:\n\n                 This argument is unfounded and contrary to the plain language of the\n         statute. The plain language of the statute applies to the administration of\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       Third, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee; rather, the school\n\ndistrict is using public resources for processing payments to the MEA-PAC.               As\n\ndiscussed earlier, the school district’s “expenditure” consists of the use of personnel,\n\noffice space, computers, software, and other public resources to remit payments to the\n\nMEA-PAC. The school district is not, for example, maintaining an advertising campaign\n\non behalf of the MEA-PAC, cold-calling MEA members, or preparing mailers or\n\nbrochures to enlist contributors. As such, the school district’s use of public resources for\n\nprocessing payments to the MEA-PAC cannot be viewed as soliciting contributions, but\n\nonly as facilitating such contributions, an entirely distinct concept.      It follows that\n\nbecause the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not fall\n\nwithin any of the three enumerated exclusions set forth in MCL 169.206(2)(c), it is not\n\nexcluded from the definition of an “expenditure.”16\n\n\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund; the statute does not specify\n       who has to make the contributions. The MEA members’ contributions to\n       the MEA-PAC are administered through the payroll deduction system.\n       Thus, the district, by administering the payroll deduction system, is\n       administering contributions to the MEA-PAC, an action that is explicitly\n       allowed according to the plain language of the statute. [Post at 6-7.]\nThis does not make sense. Even if MCL 169.206(2)(c) were not limited to § 55 entities,\nthis provision does not exclude from the definition of “expenditure” an “expenditure” for\nthe “administration of contributions”; rather it excludes an “expenditure” for the\nadministration of a “separate segregated fund or independent committee,” which is\ninapplicable here for the simple reason that the school district is not making an\n“expenditure” for the administration of a separate segregated fund or independent\ncommittee.\n16\n   Even assuming arguendo that the school district’s administration of the payroll\ndeduction plan constitutes “an expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n\n\n                                            20\n\f                     C. RELEVANCE OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS\n\n       Having determined that the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan that remits payments to the MEA-PAC constitutes both a “contribution”\n\nand an “expenditure,” the question remains whether the MEA’s preparedness to pay in\n\nadvance the school district’s costs associated with the plan remedies what would\n\notherwise constitute a violation of § 57. For the reasons that follow, it does not.\n\n       The Court of Appeals correctly held that there is “nothing in the plain language of\n\nthe MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates something that otherwise constitutes an\n\nexpenditure.” Mich Ed Ass’n, 280 Mich App at 486.

As such, the statute mandates that the\n\nschool district not “use or authorize the use of” its public resources to make a\n\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” Nothing in MCFA leads to the conclusion that the\n\nLegislature intended § 57 to be interpreted any differently. Irrespective of whether the\n\nschool district is reimbursed for its administration of the payroll deduction plan, the\n\nschool district nonetheless has employed public resources to make a “contribution or\n\nexpenditure” for political purposes.17 The advance payment of expenses simply does not\n\nnegate what § 57 is intended to prohibit. That is, the gravamen of § 57 is not that a\n\n“public body” whose resources have been employed for private political purposes be\n\ncompensated on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but that public resources not be used for such\n\npurposes in the first place. That the costs of dismantling the wall separating government\n\nand partisan political campaigning are to be paid by those who desire to use taxpayer\n\nresources for partisan political campaigning is not the point of § 57; rather, it is that the\n\nwall not be dismantled.18\n\n17\n  Moreover, the advance payment of the school district’s expenses in administering the\ndeduction plan does not avoid the question of the extent to which an exchange of\nsomething of “ascertainable monetary value” has taken place. If the school district has\nprovided a service “at cost” to the MEA-PAC, even though the “ascertainable monetary\nvalue” of that service to the MEA-PAC exceeds that cost, as it almost always will in an\neconomy in which service providers typically seek to profit from their services, further\ninquiry would be necessary concerning the specific terms of the school district-political\naction committee transaction, even if such a transaction were permissible in the first place\nunder § 57.\n18\n  If the MEA-PAC is allowed to commandeer the resources of a “public body” simply by\nreimbursing its costs, there is nothing that would prevent the political action committee of\nany corporation from demanding or receiving the same treatment.\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\f        Furthermore, the unquantifiable cost to the school district, as well as to taxpayers,\n\nparents, and students, of having time and resources diverted from the school district’s\n\nprimary responsibilities of administering schools and educating students in order to\n\nadminister a process of raising political contributions for the MEA-PAC cannot simply be\n\npaid in advance or reimbursed. Time is a zero-sum resource, and it is irretrievably lost to\n\ntaxpayers, parents, and students when it is taken away from the former responsibilities\n\nand redirected to the latter responsibilities. If some lesser portion of each day is devoted\n\nto the interests of the school district and a greater portion of each day is devoted to the\n\npartisan political interests of a labor organization, taxpayers, parents, and students suffer.\n\nAlthough advance payment may recompense the school district its employees’ salaries\n\nfor the time spent on administration of the plan and for the use of supplies and other\n\npublic resources, monetary reimbursement, paid in advance or otherwise, is simply\n\ninsufficient to recover the time that is diverted from the primary obligations of the school\n\ndistrict.\n\n        Moreover, because neither advance payments nor reimbursements prevent the\n\nprohibited “use” of public resources from occurring in the first place, the act is\n\npunishable as a misdemeanor and subject to a fine that may be “equal to the amount of\n\nthe improper contribution or expenditure.” MCL 169.257(2)(b). The fact that one of the\n\npenalties for making an improper “contribution or expenditure” requires the violator to\n\npay an amount that is “equal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure”\n\nindicates strongly that such a payment, whether in the form of a “penalty” or a\n\n“reimbursement,” does not transform an improper “contribution or expenditure” into a\n\nproper one. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, the misdemeanor statute would\n\n\n                                             23\n\fmore likely have read that the criminal sanction to be paid is “equal to the amount of the\n\nimproper contribution or expenditure, less any reimbursement of such contribution or\n\nexpenditure.”19\n\n                              V. RESPONSE TO DISSENTS\n\n       As discussed previously, Justice HATHAWAY’s position that the school district’s\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction plan is not an “expenditure” because the cost of\n\nadministration is an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,” MCL\n\n\n19\n   The MEA also argues with regard to reimbursements that because the school district is\nreimbursed all costs and expenses, its administration of the deduction plan does not\namount to a “contribution or expenditure” given that a “contribution” does not encompass\n“[a]n offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned,\nor refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt,” MCL\n169.204(3)(c), and an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n offer or tender of an\nexpenditure if expressly and unconditionally rejected or returned,” MCL 169.206(2)(e).\nHowever, this argument clearly lacks merit because the MEA-PAC’s offer to reimburse\nexpenses can hardly be said to constitute a “rejection, return, or refund” of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” When the school district collects and remits\npayments from MEA members to the MEA-PAC, it makes an “offer or tender” of a\n“contribution or expenditure.” To qualify for the “offer or tender” exception, the MEA-\nPAC would have to unconditionally “reject or return” the services of the school district,\nsomething that it neither does nor has any intention of doing. Because the school\ndistrict’s services are unconditionally accepted by the MEA-PAC, the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is not excluded from the definition of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure” under either section of MCFA. Finally, the obvious\nshould be observed, to wit, although the Legislature excluded from the definitions of\n“contribution” and “expenditure” “an offer or tender” of a “contribution or expenditure”\nthat has been rejected, returned, or refunded, there is no similar exclusion for\n“reimbursements,” an exclusion that should be thought to have been obvious, if genuinely\nintended. Justice HATHAWAY nonetheless intuits from the “reject or return” exception\nthat “contribution” in MCL 169.204(1) “clearly requires . . . a net transfer of value . . . .”\nPost at 10-11.\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f169.206(2)(c)-- an enumerated exception to the statutory definition of “expenditure”--\n\nlacks merit for two reasons.      First, a school district’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction plan is not excluded from the definition of an “expenditure” under that section\n\nbecause a “public body,” such as a school district, is not authorized to create a separate\n\nsegregated fund under MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion\n\nfrom the definition of an “expenditure.” Second, even if a “public body” is entitled to\n\nrely on this exclusion, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\ndoes not fall within the statutory exception because the school district’s “expenditure”\n\ncannot be characterized as “[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.” As\n\nalso previously discussed, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction\n\nsystem is a prohibited “contribution.” However, Justice HATHAWAY reasons that the\n\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute a\n\n“contribution.” This latter aspect of her opinion warrants further discussion.\n\n       (a) In circular fashion, Justice HATHAWAY would hold that the definition of\n\n“contribution” encompasses the term “expenditure” and, thus, because the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute an\n\n“expenditure,” it also cannot be a “contribution.” Justice HATHAWAY then states that\n\n“[t]he only other way that the administration of the system could be a ‘contribution’\n\nunder the MCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a ‘transfer of anything\n\nof ascertainable monetary value . . . .’” Post at 8. This assertion is erroneous. As\n\ndiscussed earlier, an “in-kind contribution,” which is a “contribution . . . other than\n\nmoney,” also constitutes a “contribution.” MCL 169.209(3). Similarly, MCFA defines\n\n\n                                            25\n\fas a “contribution” a “payment.” MCL 169.204(1). The school district arguably makes a\n\n“payment” to the MEA-PAC when it transfers money from participating MEA members\n\nto the MEA-PAC. Although in these circumstances the school district only acts as a\n\nconduit, a “contribution” made at the direction of another person “shall be regarded as an\n\nexpenditure or contribution attributable to both persons for purposes of expenditure or\n\ncontribution limits.” MCL 169.270.20\n\n       (b) Justice HATHAWAY further errs, in our judgment, as did the former majority\n\nopinion, by concluding that her interpretation is necessary to avoid absurd results. In\n\ndiscussing whether the administration of the payroll deduction plan constitutes a “transfer\n\nof anything of ascertainable monetary value” and thus a “contribution,” Justice\n\nHATHAWAY states:\n\n               There are two possible interpretations of the word “transfer” in the\n       statute. The first interpretation would require that any conveyance of value\n       for services provided to a campaign, regardless of whether the services are\n       paid for, would constitute a contribution. The second would require a net\n       conveyance of value in order to be a “transfer of anything of ascertainable\n       monetary value.” I believe that the latter is the only logical interpretation.\n\n20\n  Justice CAVANAGH asserts that MCL 169.270 does not apply in this case “because an\nMEA member is not seeking to circumvent the MCFA’s contribution limits,” post at 8.\nHowever, MCL 169.270 contains no subjective component. That is, regardless of\nwhether any MEA member has a desire to “circumvent” MCFA’s contribution limits, a\n“contribution or expenditure which is controlled by, or made at the direction of, another\nperson . . . shall be regarded as an expenditure or contribution attributable to both persons\nfor purposes of expenditure or contribution limits.” MCL 169.270. Because the statute is\napplicable, and because a public body is absolutely prohibited from making a\n“contribution” for political purposes under MCL 169.257(1), the only logical inference is\nthat the “contribution limit” for a public body is zero. Therefore, when the school district\nfacilitates an MEA member’s “contribution” and that “contribution” is attributable to the\nschool district pursuant to MCL 169.270, the school district as a public body has\nsurpassed its “contribution limit.”\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       Any other interpretation of “contribution” would lead to an absurd result,\n       and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results. For example,\n       under the majority’s interpretation, a print shop that sells signage to a\n       campaign in the normal course of business would be making a contribution\n       to the campaign because it has transferred something of monetary value to\n       the campaign, even though the shop has been compensated for the cost of\n       providing the signage. Such an interpretation of “contribution” defies\n       common sense, and I do not read the statute in this manner. [Post at 9-10\n       (citations omitted).]\n\nBy emphasizing that her interpretation is necessary to avoid “absurd results,” Justice\n\nHATHAWAY appears to concede that the more natural interpretation of the law is that\n\nasserted by this majority opinion. Resort to an “absurd results” analysis is generally\n\nnecessary only to avoid an interpretation that would otherwise flow from a statute by the\n\napplication of traditional principles of interpretation.\n\n       In essence, Justice HATHAWAY believes that it is necessary to read MCL\n\n169.204(1) as if it referred to a “net transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue,” which it does not, in order to avoid the allegedly “absurd result” to which our\n\ninterpretation of MCL 169.204(1) would lead.

Nonetheless, it is a part of the former majority opinion under reconsideration\ntoday. Apparently, § 7 of the wages and fringe benefits act, MCL 408.477, provided\nauthority for the school district to administer the payroll deduction plan on December 29,\n2010, but not any longer. Given that Justice HATHAWAY now seems to agree with the\nmajority that the wages and fringe benefits act does not provide authority for the district\nto administer the deduction plan, does she now have an alternative analysis concerning\nfrom where this authority derives?\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fdistricts and school officers have only such powers as the statutes expressly or impliedly\n\ngrant to them.” Jacox v Van Buren Consol Sch Dist Bd of Ed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3498375\"><a href=\"/opinion/3528412/jacox-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3498375\"><a href=\"/opinion/3528412/jacox-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1940). “‘The extent of the authority of the people’s public agents is measured\n\nby the statute from which they derive their authority, not by their own acts and\n\nassumption of authority.’” Sittler v Mich College of Mining & Technology Bd of Control,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2154627\"><a href=\"/opinion/2154627/sittler-v-board-of-control/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687; 53 NW2d 681 (1952) (citation omitted). Contrary to the former\n\nmajority opinion, the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan for a political\n\naction committee is not expressly or impliedly granted to schools by any statute.\n\n       While MCL 408.477 of the wages and fringe benefits act refers to payroll\n\ndeductions, it does not authorize school districts to administer payroll deductions for\n\npolitical action committees. MCL 408.477(1) provides in full:\n\n              Except for those deductions required or expressly permitted by law\n       or by a collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from\n       the wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an\n       employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established by a\n       corporation or labor organization under section 55 of the Michigan\n\n       On this note, Justice CAVANAGH asserts that when MCL 408.477(1) and MCL\n423.209, which grants authority for public employees to engage in collective bargaining,\nare “considered in tandem,” they “‘expressly or impliedly grant’ school districts the\nauthority to enter collective-bargaining agreements that require a school district to\nadminister a payroll deduction plan.” Post at 10. But this analysis is flawed. We have\nno doubt that school districts have the authority to engage in collective bargaining, and\nalso the authority to administer certain types of payroll deduction plans. However, that\nauthority is limited to “engag[ing] in lawful concerted activities . . . .” MCL 423.209\n(emphasis added). The collective-bargaining agreement in this case required the district\nto engage in an activity in violation of MCL 169.257 and thus cannot serve as the source\nof authority to make a “contribution or expenditure.” By contrast, we have no doubt that\na school district has the authority under the law to administer 401(k) contributions, social\nsecurity and Medicare deductions, and payroll deductions for the payment of union dues\nand service fees.\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f       campaign finance act, Act No. 388 of the Public Acts of 1976, being\n       section 169.255 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, without the full, free, and\n       written consent of the employee, obtained without intimidation or fear of\n       discharge for refusal to permit the deduction.[23]\n\nFrom this provision, the former majority opinion summarily concluded that, “under the\n\nplain language of MCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to administer a payroll\n\ndeduction plan that contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA enters into a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement that expressly permits the deductions.” Mich Ed Ass’n,\n\n488 Mich at 38 n 29.        This is another example of the former majority opinion’s\n\nmisinterpretation of a statute. MCL 408.477 has absolutely nothing to do with whether a\n\n“public body” may administer a payroll deduction plan for the benefit of the MEA-PAC.\n\nRather, the statute describes the approval required for an employer to deduct a portion of\n\nan employee’s wages and states that in order to deduct wages from an employee, the\n\nemployer must obtain the employee’s voluntary consent. The statute also provides that\n\nsuch consent is not required when the wage deduction is expressly permitted by law or by\n\na collective-bargaining agreement. The most that can be discerned from this statute as it\n\npertains to the instant case is that, if the school district is to deduct wages from its\n\nemployees, it must obtain the employees’ voluntary consent unless the deduction is\n\nexpressly permitted by law or a collective-bargaining agreement. However, neither MCL\n\n408.477 nor any other statute provides authority for a “public body” to administer a\n\npayroll deduction plan that contributes money to a political action committee. Therefore,\n\neven if the school district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan did not constitute a\n\n23\n  See also MCL 169.255(6) (regulating the manner in which contributions for a separate\nsegregated fund may be obtained).\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\f“contribution” or an “expenditure,” which it clearly does, the school district would still\n\nlack the authority to administer such a plan because no statute gives the school district\n\nthis authority and the school district only has the authority granted to it by statute.\n\nIndeed, as explained earlier, the Legislature has affirmatively and expressly forbidden a\n\nschool district, or any other public body, from making a “contribution or expenditure” to\n\na political action committee.\n\n                        VI. JUSTIFICATION FOR REHEARING\n\n       The dissenting justices assert, explicitly or implicitly, that this opinion undoes\n\ntheir opinion of December 29, 2010, upon rehearing without offering any new\n\njustification for doing so other than the views expressed in the dissent from that opinion.\n\nSee post at 1 (HATHAWAY, J., dissenting), and post at 1 n 1 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n\nFor the benefit of the dissenting justices, we will attempt to provide this justification.\n\n       First, contrary to Justice HATHAWAY’s assertion, we respectfully disagree that the\n\nprevious majority opinion “followed the language of the law.” Post at 2. Indeed, we\n\nbelieve that opinion to have interpreted MCFA in a manner that bore little resemblance to\n\nits actual language. The previous majority opinion (a) effectively inserted words into the\n\nlaw that are absent from the law, e.g., construing the “transfer of anything of\n\nascertainable monetary value,” to require that there be a “transfer of anything of net\n\nascertainable monetary value,” see Mich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 36, (b) effectively altered\n\nwords in the law, e.g., substituting for “ascertainable monetary value” “ascertained”\n\nmonetary value, id. at 37, (c) applied the facts to the law in an implausible fashion, e.g.,\n\nasserting that the administration of the payroll deduction plan was not done for the\n\n“‘purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the\n\n\n                                              31\n\fqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,’” id., quoting MCL 169.204(1), (d)\n\nmischaracterized the facts, e.g., asserting that the administration of the payroll deduction\n\nplan by the school constituted no “transfer of ascertainable monetary value” to the MEA-\n\nPAC but “merely allow[ed] someone else to make a contribution,” Mich Ed Ass’n, 488\n\nMich at 37, (e) failed to analyze relevant and determinative provisions of the law, e.g.,\n\nthe definition of an “in-kind contribution,” (f) paraphrased the law in an imprecise\n\nmanner, e.g., summarizing an exception to the law’s broad prohibition that is applicable\n\nto the administration of a separate segregated fund or independent committee as one\n\napplicable to the administration of contributions, id. at 29-30, and (g) overlooked words\n\nof the law, e.g., asserting that because the administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\ndoes not constitute an “expenditure,” the “only other way” that it could constitute a\n\n“‘contribution’” would be if a “‘transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value’”\n\nresulted, id. at 34, quoting MCL 169.204(1), despite the fact that MCFA defines a\n\n“contribution” in other ways to include “a payment” or an “in-kind contribution.”\n\n       Second, while the dissenting opinions make light of the fact that we supposedly\n\nhave little justification for this new opinion other than the views expressed in the dissent\n\nfrom the original opinion, we believe that such a justification is actually rather\n\ncompelling. That is, we believe that the previous dissent was in accordance with the\n\nlanguage and intent of MCFA, while the previous majority opinion was not,24 and as\n\n24\n   Justice CAVANAGH claims that we fail to “realize that [his] interpretation of the MCFA\nis consistent” with the purpose of MCL 169.257. Post at 16. This is a rather remarkable\nproposition. If the purpose of MCL 169.257 is, as we believe it to be, to mandate the\nseparation of the government from politics, then it would seem that Justice CAVANAGH’s\ninterpretation, which permits the use of public resources in support of partisan political\n\n\n                                            32\n\fbetween an analysis of the law that is in accordance with its language and intent and one\n\nthat is not, we prefer the former.\n\n       Third, we “justify” granting the motion for rehearing, and reconsidering our\n\nprevious decision, because we believe that the issue before the Court is one of\n\nconsiderable importance to the people of this state and to the integrity of the state’s\n\npolitical and public processes. Through MCFA, the people have sought to maintain a\n\nseparation of politics and the government in order to maintain governmental neutrality in\n\nelections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used\n\nto subsidize partisan political activities. The previous majority opinion, and the present\n\ndissenting opinions, would dismantle this separation. They would increasingly involve\n\nthe taxpayer in the subsidization of partisan political activities and increasingly erode the\n\nneutrality of public institutions in these same activities. While the dissenting justices\n\nseem very little moved by these concerns, we believe that they are substantial. It should\n\nbe a matter of great pride to the people of Michigan that its history, with very few\n\nexceptions, has been a history characterized by electoral fair play and an honest political\n\nprocess. Both parties, and their supporters, can take credit for this history. We believe\n\nthat the people of this state understand well the importance to this history of a legal\n\nsystem in which parties and political action committees cannot commandeer taxpayer\n\nresources and in which government cannot place a thumb on the scale concerning who\n\nwill prevail in the political process. In short, we believe that the people understand well,\n\nactivity, is the antithesis of that purpose. That is, MCL 169.257 prohibits the use of\npublic resources in aid of partisan political activity, and Justice CAVANAGH’s\ninterpretation permits it.\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\ffor it is at the root of MCFA, that to breach these principles is incompatible with a\n\ngovernment that is “instituted for . . . [the] equal benefit . . . and protection” of the\n\npeople. Const 1963, art 1, § 1.\n\n       Finally, we believe that the former majority’s remarkable treatment of this case\n\nitself constitutes grounds for granting rehearing. This case was alternately subject to\n\nunprecedentedly dilatory treatment and unprecedentedly accelerated treatment.            See\n\nMich Ed Ass’n, 488 Mich at 64-68 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). Before this case was\n\nheard in November of last year, it was subject to the lengthiest delay, by far, of any of the\n\n280 cases considered under the procedures of MCR 7.302(H)(1), which authorize this\n\nCourt to order oral argument before deciding whether to grant leave to appeal. See also\n\nn 4 of this opinion. Subsequently, after finally granting leave to appeal and hearing oral\n\narguments, a majority opinion was prepared in near-record time, the period for dissenting\n\njustices to respond to this opinion was substantially shortened, and, in December, these\n\nopinions issued in what approached, if not exceeded, record time for a major decision of\n\nthis Court.\n\n                                   VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       MCL 169.257 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to make a\n\n“contribution or expenditure” for political purposes.      Through administration of the\n\npayroll deduction plan in this case, remitting payments to the MEA-PAC, the school\n\ndistrict makes both a “contribution” and an “expenditure” as defined by MCFA. The\n\nMEA-PAC’s offer to reimburse the school district for expenses incurred in its\n\nadministration of the plan does not remedy an otherwise clear violation of MCL 169.257.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but also with\n\n\n                                             34\n\fthe evident purpose of MCL 169.257, which is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities.   The payroll deduction plan in this case is\n\ninconsistent with this legislative purpose and inconsistent with the language of the law.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                      Stephen J.

I write separately to emphasize, once again, that granting\n\na rehearing motion is not limited to cases in which new legal arguments were presented\n\nto the Court and to clarify that this is not a case in which it can fairly be said that\n\n“precedent” has been disturbed.\n\n         As Justice ZAHRA recently explained in detail in Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v\n\nDep’t of Environmental Quality,1 MCR 7.313(E) governs motions for rehearing in this\n\nCourt.

The\n\npublic school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is both a\n\n“contribution” and an “expenditure” for political purposes under the MCFA, which\n\n3\n    Id. at 887.\n4\n    See id.\n5\n Id. at 888, citing United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims\nAss’n (On Rehearing), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 795 NW2d 101 (2010); Duncan v Michigan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010) (DAVIS, J., concurring); McCready v Hoffius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999).\n6\n    See Anglers, 489 Mich at 889.\n7\n    MCL 169.201 et seq.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fviolates MCL 169.257(1). Justice HATHAWAY’s position that “nothing in the plain\n\nlanguage of MCL 169.257(1) prohibits a school district from administering a payroll\n\ndeduction system that allows [MEA] members to automatically send contributions to\n\nthe . . . MEA-PAC”8 misconstrues the MCFA.\n\n         Second, this case plainly involves issues of substantial jurisprudential importance\n\nto our state. This case concerns “the separation of the government from politics in order\n\nto maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and\n\nprevent taxpayer funds from . . . subsidiz[ing] partisan political activities.”9 The legality\n\nof the administration of the payroll deduction plan is of considerable public interest given\n\nthat the plan would have essentially allowed taxpayers to help fund a political action\n\ncommittee. Moreover, the case involved an issue of first impression that is not likely to\n\nreappear before the Court on a regular basis. Through the MCFA, the Legislature\n\nintended to keep public resources out of the political process, and the statute could not\n\nmake this plainer.\n\n         Notably, the grant of the rehearing motion, which was timely filed, asked the\n\nCourt to rehear a case that was decided several days before I was sworn in and after the\n\ncase had pended for more than two years in our Court.10 To the extent that this case may\n\n\n8\n    Post at 1.\n9\n Ante at 35.\n10\n  The Court of Appeals issued its opinion in this case on August 28, 2008. The MEA\napplied for leave to appeal on October 8, 2008. On May 8, 2009, this Court ordered oral\nargument on the application. Nearly six months later, on November 5, 2009, this Court\nheard oral argument on the application. Approximately seven months later, on June 4,\n2010, this Court granted the MEA’s application for leave to appeal. Then, three days\n\n\n                                              3\n\fbe deemed to be precedent, its precedential value is de minimis, at best. As noted by\n\nJustice MARILYN KELLY in Petersen v Magna Corp, “[s]tare decisis attempts to balance\n\ntwo competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and\n\ndecisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.”11 In Robinson v Detroit,12 this\n\nCourt set forth four factors to be considered before this Court overrules a previously\n\ndecided case. The purpose of enunciating these factors was to ensure that respectful\n\nconsideration would be given to the cases decided by our predecessors before such cases\n\nare overruled. “The first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was\n\nwrongly decided.”13       Consistently with Justice MARILYN KELLY’s explanation in\n\nPetersen14 of the competing considerations that the doctrine of stare decisis attempts to\n\nreconcile, the remaining three factors balance the need to correct error against the desire\n\nfor stability and reliability in the law. Specifically, the Court observed that it should also\n\nreview “whether the decision at issue defies ‘practical workability,’ whether reliance\n\ninterests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no\n\nlonger justify the questioned decision.”15 When a case is considered on rehearing, none\n\n\nbefore the composition of the Court was set to change, the prior majority entered an\nopinion on December 29, 2010, more than two years after the MEA applied for leave to\nappeal.\n11\n     Petersen v Magna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314; 773 NW2d 564 (2009).\n12\n     Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 613 NW2d 307 (2000).\n13\n     Id. at 464.\n14\n     Petersen, 484 Mich at 314.\n15\n     Robinson, 462 Mich at 464 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fof the Robinson factors outweighs the need to issue a legally correct opinion. No\n\nreasonable legal reliance can be placed on an opinion that has not yet ended its\n\nprocedural course, however extended, in our Court. The opinion at issue was only days\n\nold when the composition of the Court changed. The rehearing motion, timely filed,\n\nnecessarily required adjudication by the newly composed Court. As a justice of the Court\n\nwho had not before considered the merits of the underlying claim, it is my constitutional\n\nduty to address the legal merits of the issues presented. Simply put, I would be derelict in\n\nmy duty if I were to give deference to legal reasoning with which I find fault. On\n\nrehearing, this case rises or falls on the merits of the legal claim. Blind allegiance to the\n\nnotion of stare decisis is not appropriate and is a wholly unpersuasive rationale for\n\nallowing a days-old decision to stand.\n\n       In sum, rehearing was warranted in this case because, in my view, the MCFA\n\nplainly requires holding that the public school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is both an “expenditure” and a “contribution” that violates the act and the\n\nissue was both properly before the Court for rehearing and a matter of substantial\n\njurisprudential significance to our state.\n\n\n                                                         Mary Beth Kelly\n                                                         Brian K.

ANALYSIS\n\n        The MCFA’s general rule regarding prohibited “contributions” and “expenditures”\n\nis provided in MCL 169.254(1), which states in relevant part:\n\n              Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in . . . [MCL\n        169.255], and to loans made in the ordinary course of business, a\n        corporation, joint stock company, domestic dependent sovereign, or labor\n        organization shall not make a contribution or expenditure . . . .\n\nThus, according to the plain language of MCL 169.254(1), MCL 169.255 is an exception\n\nto the general rule in MCL 169.254(1). That exception states, in relevant part:\n\n               A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint\n        stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization\n        formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make\n        an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n        contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n        A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n        making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n        committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n        political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]\n\nFinally, MCL 169.257(1) specifically addresses how the MCFA applies to “public\n\nbodies,” which includes school districts,2 when it states:\n\n               A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n        or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n        software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n        other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure . . . .\n\n2\n    MCL 169.211(6)(c).\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fThus, under MCL 169.254(1) and MCL 169.257(1), private entities and “public bodies”\n\nare barred from making “contributions” and “expenditures” unless an exception applies.\n\nThe MCFA provides detailed definitions of “contribution” and “expenditure”; therefore,\n\nin order to properly apply the relevant portions of the MCFA to the facts of this case, it is\n\nnecessary to closely consider those statutory definitions to fully understand what\n\nconstitutes a prohibited “contribution” and “expenditure” as defined in the MCFA.\n\n                                 A. “CONTRIBUTION”\n\n       The MCFA defines “contribution” in MCL 169.204(1), which states:\n\n              “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n       expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n       loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n       a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for\n       the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for\n       the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[3]\n\nThis statutory definition can be divided into two portions: (1) a list of actions that could\n\nconstitute a “contribution,” i.e., “a payment, gift, subscription, assessment, expenditure,\n\ncontract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance, loan, or donation of money or\n\nanything of ascertainable monetary value, or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value to a person,” and (2) the purpose for which the actions must be taken in\n\norder to constitute a “contribution,” i.e., “for the purpose of influencing the nomination or\n\nelection of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n3\n  The MCFA also provides a list of exclusions from its definition of “contribution.” See\nMCL 169.204(3)(a) through (c). It is not necessary to consider those exclusions in this\ncase, however, because the plain language of the statutory definition of “contribution”\ndoes not encompass the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at\nissue here.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fStated another way, the statutory definition requires a court to determine (1) whether a\n\nparty’s conduct falls within the list of actions provided and, if so, (2) the purpose for that\n\naction.\n\n          As the majority insists, the list of actions provided in the first portion of the\n\ndefinition of “contribution” arguably could include the school district’s administration of\n\nthe payroll deduction plan. But even accepting arguendo the majority’s conclusion that\n\nthe administration of the plan represents “a transfer of [something] of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value” to the MEA’s political action committee (MEA-PAC), the question\n\nremains whether the school district administers the plan “for the purpose of influencing\n\nthe nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a\n\nballot question.”\n\n          As the previous majority opinion in this case explained,\n\n          a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not an\n          impermissible contribution under the MCFA because the system is not\n          administered “for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n          candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n          When a public body administers a payroll deduction plan, it does not do so\n          in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot question. Rather,\n          administering the plan is one step removed: it merely allows someone else\n          to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a political issue. The\n          public body administers the plan simply because it is required to do so as\n          part of a labor contract between the public body and its employees.\n          Consequently, because a public school’s administration of a payroll\n          deduction system is not done for the purpose of influencing a political\n          issue, the administration of the system is not a contribution under the\n          MCFA. [Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 488 Mich at 37-38 (citation\n          omitted).]\n\nThe majority attempts to counter the previous majority’s explanation of the plain\n\nmeaning of the MCFA’s definition of “contribution” by first claiming that the school\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fdistrict makes a “contribution” because, by administering the payroll deduction plan, it\n\n“provid[es] valuable services to the MEA-PAC in aid and furtherance of its political\n\nactivities.” Ante at 13 n 12. This analysis, however, impermissibly strays from the\n\nstatutory language because it focuses on the arguable result of the school district’s\n\nadministration of the plan rather than the school district’s purpose in administering the\n\nplan, as the statute requires. The fact that, at some remote time in the future, the school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan eventually results in the furtherance\n\nof the MEA’s political activities does not necessarily make the school district’s actions a\n\n“contribution” as defined in MCL 169.204(1). Rather, the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is only a “contribution” if, at the time the school district performs the\n\nservice, it does so “for the purpose” of influencing an election.\n\n       Second, the majority argues that, in considering the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan under MCL 169.204(1), the focus should not be on whether\n\nthe school district is attempting to influence a political race, but whether the payment that\n\nit provides is intended for that purpose. While the majority is correct to focus on the\n\n“payment,” the majority confuses the two payments at issue in this case: the MEA\n\nmember’s “payment” in the form of money deducted from his or her paycheck and the\n\nschool district’s arguable “payment” in the form of administering the payroll deduction\n\nplan that transfers the employee’s donation to the MEA-PAC.4 While the employee’s\n\n4\n  The majority further confuses the two payments at issue with its discussion of the\ndefinition of the word “make.” Contrary to the majority’s claims, when the school\ndistrict administers the payroll deduction plan, it does not “‘cause[] to exist or happen’\n‘contributions’ from MEA members . . . .” Ante at 9. Rather, the MEA member “causes\nto exist or happen” the “contribution” when the MEA member voluntarily chooses to\n\n\n                                              5\n\fdonation to the MEA-PAC is likely a “contribution” because it is made “for the purpose”\n\nof influencing a political race, the majority erroneously imputes the employee’s purpose\n\nin making the contribution to the school district.       It is not the purpose behind the\n\nemployee’s donation that is the focus of the relevant inquiry; rather, it is the purpose\n\nbehind the school district’s decision to administer the payroll deduction plan, which\n\nmerely transfers donations from the employee to the MEA-PAC, that must be considered.\n\nSimilarly, the majority erroneously imputes the MEA’s purpose in collecting\n\ncontributions to the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan. See\n\nante at 12 (claiming that the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\nis a “contribution” because “the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate\n\nthe involvement of the MEA in partisan politics”). What the majority fails to grasp is\n\nthat, when properly applied to this case, MCL 169.204(1) is focused solely on the school\n\ndistrict’s purpose in acting in a specific fashion.\n\n       In order to determine the school district’s “purpose,” one must first define the\n\nword and then apply that definition to the facts of this case. The MCFA does not define\n\n“purpose”; therefore, it is proper to consult a dictionary to assist the Court in determining\n\nthe word’s common meaning. McCormick v Carrier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195; 795 NW2d 517\n\n(2010); see, also, MCL 8.3a. “Purpose” is defined as “[a] result or effect that is intended\n\n\ndonate to the MEA-PAC. The school district merely transfers money from one place to\nanother. Just as a bank, acting in response to a check written by a customer, does not\n“make” a payment when it transfers money from the customer’s account to the party\nidentified on the check, the school district does not “make” a contribution when it\ntransfers money from a MEA member’s paycheck to the MEA-PAC at the MEA\nmember’s direction.\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\for desired; intention.”   The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition\n\n(1982), def 2 (emphasis added). Thus, in order to determine the school district’s purpose\n\nfor administering the payroll deduction plan, one must consider the school district’s\n\nintent. “Intent,” in turn, is defined as “[t]he state of mind operative at the time of an\n\naction. . . . [h]aving the mind fastened upon some purpose.” Id., defs 2 and 3. Similarly,\n\n“intention” is defined as “[a] plan of action; design” and “[a]n aim that guides\n\naction . . . .” Id., defs 1 and 2. In light of these definitions, in order to determine the\n\nschool district’s purpose as it relates to the statutory definition of “contribution,” one\n\nmust determine the school district’s “aim that guides [its] action” and the “state of mind\n\noperative” when the school district administers the payroll deduction plan.\n\n       As the majority notes, the school district and the MEA entered into a collective-\n\nbargaining agreement, part of which required the school district to administer the payroll\n\ndeduction plan at issue in this case. Because the school district is required by contract to\n\nadminister the payroll deduction plan, the school district’s purpose in administering the\n\nplan is to satisfy its bargained-for contractual duties. The school district’s purpose was\n\nnot to “influenc[e] the nomination or election of a candidate” or “the qualification,\n\npassage, or defeat of a ballot question.” MCL 169.204(1). Therefore, although the\n\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan may, in some tangential or\n\nremote sense, eventually influence an election, that was not the school district’s purpose.\n\nConsequently, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a\n\n“contribution” as defined by the MCFA.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f        The majority also attempts to support its “contribution” analysis with a quotation\n\nfrom MCL 169.270.5 Ante at 26. But, in my view, that statute is intended to prevent an\n\nentity from circumventing the contribution limits in MCL 169.252 and MCL 169.252a by\n\ntransferring money to other entities and then directing those entities to make\n\n“contributions” or directing another entity to use its own resources to make a\n\n“contribution.”   Indeed, the statute expressly states that it applies “for purposes of\n\nexpenditure and contribution limits.” MCL 169.270. Thus, contrary to the majority’s\n\ninterpretation, the statute is focused on enforcing contribution limits, not determining\n\nwhether a particular act is a “contribution” or “expenditure” as defined in MCL 169.204\n\nand MCL 169.206. Notably, because an MEA member is not seeking to circumvent the\n\nMCFA’s contribution limits by making a contribution through the payroll deduction plan,\n\nMCL 169.270 is not applicable to the school district in this case. The MEA member does\n\nnot “control” a “contribution” made by the school district or “direct” the school district to\n\nmake a contribution from the school district’s own funds. Rather, the MEA member\n\nmakes a contribution out of his or her own funds, and the school district merely transfers\n\nthose funds. Throughout the entire transaction, the contribution is always attributable to\n\nthe MEA member.\n\n\n5\n    MCL 169.270 states:\n\n               A contribution or expenditure which is controlled by, or made at the\n        direction of, another person, including a parent organization, subsidiary,\n        division, committee, department, branch, or local unit of a person, shall be\n        reported by the person making the expenditure or contribution, and shall be\n        regarded as an expenditure or contribution attributable to both persons for\n        purposes of expenditure or contribution limits.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f        Furthermore, by claiming that the school district exceeds its inferential\n\ncontribution limit of zero when it administers the payroll deduction plan, the majority\n\nonce again improperly imputes to the school district the MEA member’s purpose for\n\nmaking the contribution. As this opinion explains, an act is not a “contribution” as\n\ndefined in MCL 169.204(1) unless the act is performed for the specific purpose of\n\n“influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage,\n\nor defeat of a ballot question.” Because the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is not performed for that purpose, the school district does not make a\n\n“contribution” and, thus, does not exceed any arguably applicable contribution limit.6\n\n        Finally, the majority questions the school district’s authority to administer the\n\npayroll deduction plan at issue in this case. However, this concern is misplaced because\n\nschool districts, by statute, have the authority to enter into collective-bargaining\n\nagreements, MCL 423.209,7 and school districts may administer a payroll deduction plan\n\n6\n   The majority also argues that, under MCL 169.209(3), the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is an “in-kind contribution” because the\nadministration of the plan is a “contribution . . . other than money.” But, as the majority\nseems to accept, under the plain language of MCL 169.209(3), the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan cannot be an “in-kind contribution” unless it\nis a “contribution” as defined in MCL 169.204(1). Thus, because I believe that the\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a “contribution” for\nthe reasons previously provided, it is also not an “in-kind contribution.”\n7\n    MCL 423.209 states:\n\n                It shall be lawful for public employees to organize together or to\n        form, join or assist in labor organizations, to engage in lawful concerted\n        activities for the purpose of collective negotiation or bargaining or other\n        mutual aid and protection, or to negotiate or bargain collectively with their\n        public employers through representatives of their own free choice.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fas part of a collective-bargaining agreement pursuant to the wages and fringe benefits act,\n\nspecifically MCL 408.477(1). Thus, in the abstract, the majority’s argument that the\n\nwages and fringe benefits act does not directly grant school districts the authority to\n\nadminister a payroll deduction plan is correct, but the majority errs when it concludes that\n\nthe wages and fringe benefits act is irrelevant to this case. Rather, when that act is\n\nconsidered in tandem with MCL 423.209, the statutes “expressly or impliedly grant”\n\nschool districts the authority to enter collective-bargaining agreements that require a\n\nschool district to administer a payroll deduction plan.

Because the school district’s\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is neither a “contribution” nor an\n\n“expenditure” for the reasons discussed in this dissent, administration of the plan does not\n\nviolate MCL 169.257 and, thus, is lawful.\n\n                                  B. “EXPENDITURE”\n\n       Although the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is not a\n\nprohibited “contribution,” it could nevertheless be barred under MCL 169.257 if it meets\n\nthe statutory definition of “expenditure.”         Therefore, that definition must also be\n\nexamined in the context of this case.         The MCFA defines “expenditure” in MCL\n\n169.206(1), which states, in relevant part:\n\n             “Expenditure” means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of\n       payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods,\n       materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n\n\nSee, also, MCL 423.217(1) (protecting collective-bargaining agreements of public school\nemployees).\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or\n       defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any\n       of the following:\n\n             (a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n       monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n       candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\nThe MCFA, however, also expressly excludes some conduct that would otherwise meet\n\nits general definition of “expenditure.” Notably, MCL 169.206(2) states, in relevant part:\n\n              Expenditure does not include any of the following:\n\n                                          * * *\n\n               (c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n       solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n       committee.\n\n       The majority argues that the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan is barred by the MCFA because it is an “expenditure” under the general\n\ndefinition in MCL 169.206(1) and the exclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) does not apply to\n\npublic bodies. The majority concludes that the “exclusion is clearly designed to apply\n\nonly to corporations and labor organizations that possess the authority to create, establish,\n\nadminister, or fund separate segregated funds in the first place.”             Ante at 15.\n\nFurthermore, the majority claims that MCL 169.257 and MCL 169.254 apply to public\n\nbodies and private entities respectively the same general rule barring “expenditures,” but,\n\nbecause MCL 169.257 does not refer to the exception in MCL 169.255 permitting some\n\ntypes of “expenditures,” MCL 169.257 represents an “absolute prohibition” against\n\nexpenditures by public bodies. I disagree with the majority’s analysis.\n\n       To begin with, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, neither the general definition\n\nof “expenditure” in MCL 169.206(1) nor the exclusion from the general definition in\n\n\n                                             11\n\fMCL 169.206(2)(c) indicates that the exclusion only applies to private entities. Thus,\n\nthere is simply no basis in the statutory language to support the majority’s position.\n\n       Likewise, nothing in MCL 169.257 supports the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nexclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) from the definition of “expenditure” does not apply to\n\npublic bodies. While the majority is correct that the exceptions in MCL 169.255 do not\n\napply to public bodies, that fact does not support the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nexclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) also does not apply with equal force to public bodies. In\n\nfact, the majority’s claim that this exclusion is “plainly directed toward elaborating on\n\n[MCL 169.255] by making clear that no expenditures authorized by [MCL 169.255] for\n\nthe establishment of a separate segregated fund will be treated as a prohibited\n\nexpenditure,” ante at 16 n 13, leaves no distinction between the two statutes. Therefore,\n\nif the majority were correct that MCL 169.206(2)(c) does not apply to public bodies,\n\nMCL 169.206(2)(c) is completely unnecessary because, under the majority’s\n\ninterpretation, it says the exact same thing as MCL 169.255. The majority’s efforts to\n\nread these two statutes “harmonious[ly]” are strained and renders MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nsuperfluous. I decline to adopt such an interpretation because the result is impermissible\n\nunder the rules of statutory interpretation. People v McGraw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">20, 126; 771\n\nNW2d 655 (2009) (“In interpreting a statute, we avoid a construction that would render\n\npart of the statute surplusage or nugatory.”).\n\n       Rather, I believe that MCL 169.257 explains that public bodies are not to make\n\n“expenditures” as defined in MCL 169.206(1), but if the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan satisfies the exclusion from the definition of “expenditure”\n\nfound in MCL 169.206(2)(c) administration of the plan is not an “expenditure,” and the\n\n\n                                             12\n\fplan does not violate MCL 169.257. Thus, in a sense, the majority is correct that MCL\n\n169.257 creates an “absolute prohibition” against expenditures by public bodies, but the\n\nmajority misses the boat when it concludes that this “absolute prohibition” bars the\n\nschool district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at issue in this case.\n\nBecause the school district’s administration of the plan is excluded from the definition of\n\n“expenditure,” there is simply no “expenditure” to prohibit.8\n\n       The majority’s erroneous analysis further results from its insistence that the\n\nexclusion in MCL 169.206(2)(c) only applies to expenditures for the establishment or\n\nadministration of a separate segregated fund. This interpretation of MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nis misguided because the statutory exclusion focuses on expenditures associated with\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund, not expenditures associated with the creation\n\nor management of a separate segregated fund.\n\n       Specifically, MCL 169.206(2)(c) provides that an “expenditure” does not include\n\n“[a]n expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to\n\na separate segregated fund . . . .” The majority errs because it replaces “to” with “of”\n\nand ignores the word “contributions” when considering “establishment” and\n\n8\n  Contrary to the majority’s claims, my interpretation does not permit political action\ncommittees to “commandeer[]” government resources. Ante at 16 n 13. Obviously, a\npublic body is always free to decline the MEA’s or any other organization’s request to\nengage in a plan like the one at issue in this case. Indeed, the school district in this case\nfreely agreed to administer the payroll deduction plan as part of the arm’s-length\nnegotiations with the MEA that culminated in a collective-bargaining agreement. Thus,\nthe MEA did not “commandeer” anything. Furthermore, my interpretation would not\n“always” lead to the same result. Ante at 16 n 13. Rather, a public body would only be\npermitted to engage in the limited conduct excluded from the definition of “expenditure”\nwhen the specific requirements of MCL 169.206(2)(c) are met.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f“administration” as used in MCL 169.206(2)(c). Stated another way, the majority’s\n\nanalysis rewrites the statute as follows: “‘[e]xpenditure’ does not include . . . [a]n\n\nexpenditure for the establishment or administration of a separate segregated fund or\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund . . . .” Therefore, the majority’s\n\ninterpretation impermissibly adds words to the statute.

Indeed, the majority opinion expressly states\n\nthat “the school district is not making an ‘expenditure’ for the administration of a\n\nseparate segregated fund . . . because . . . the school district is simply administering the\n\npayroll deduction plan . . . .”     Ante at 19 (emphasis altered); see, also, ante at 19\n\n(claiming that MCL 169.206[2][c] supports the majority’s conclusion that “the only\n\nadministrative costs that are excluded under this exclusion are those associated with\n\nadministering a ‘separate segregated fund or independent committee’”). By its own\n\nwords, the majority displays its need to impermissibly change the language of the statute\n\nin order to support its holding.9\n\n       Thus, although I agree with the majority that the school district is not making an\n\n“expenditure” for the administration of a separate segregated fund, that point is irrelevant\n\nbecause that is not what the statutory exclusion requires. Rather, by administering\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Indeed, the majority expressly states, without explanation and contrary to the plain\nlanguage of the statute, that MCL 169.206(2)(c) “does not exclude from the definition of\n‘expenditure’ an ‘expenditure’ for the ‘administration of contributions’; rather it excludes\nan ‘expenditure’ for the administration of a ‘separate segregated fund or independent\ncommittee’ . . . .” Ante at 20 n 15.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fcontributions to a separate segregated fund, the school district’s conduct falls squarely\n\nwithin the statutory exclusion from the general definition of “expenditure.”10\n\n                              C. PURPOSE OF MCL 169.257\n\n       Finally, the majority supports its interpretation of the MCFA by claiming that the\n\npurpose of MCL 169.257 “is to mandate the separation of the government from politics\n\nin order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic\n\nprocesses, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political\n\nactivities,” ante at 6-7, and only its analysis is consistent with that purpose. To begin\n\nwith, the majority’s soaring rhetoric could easily be classified as nothing more than an\n\nimpassioned plea in support of the policy that the majority wishes to impose, see, e.g.,\n\nante at 33, but more importantly, the majority goes well beyond the statutory language in\n\na misguided effort to determine this provision’s purpose.\n\n       Focusing instead on the statutory language alone, it is clear that the purpose of\n\nMCL 169.257 is simply to prevent a public body from using its resources “to make a\n\ncontribution or expenditure” as those words are defined in MCL 169.204 and MCL\n\n\n10\n   The school district’s involvement in the payroll deduction plan can properly be\ndescribed as “[a]n expenditure for the . . . administration . . . of contributions . . . .” MCL\n169.206(2)(c). “Administration” is defined as, among other things, “[t]he management of\naffairs” and “[t]he dispensing, applying, or tendering of something . . . .” The American\nHeritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982), defs 1 and 7. In this case, the\nschool district’s involvement in the payroll deduction plan involves the management and\ndispensing of employees’ contributions to the MEA-PAC. Thus, the common meaning of\nthe words used in the exclusion from the definition of “expenditure” found in MCL\n169.206(2)(c) further support the conclusion that the exclusion applies in this case. The\nmajority appears to agree when it states that the school district’s administration of the\npayroll deduction plan only facilitates contributions to the MEA-PAC. See ante at 20.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f169.206, respectively. The majority fails to realize that my interpretation of the MCFA is\n\nconsistent with the true purpose of MCL 169.257 as determined from the language of that\n\nprovision because the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan at\n\nissue in this case is neither a “contribution” nor an “expenditure.”\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n       In my view, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does\n\nnot violate the MCFA because it is neither a “contribution” nor an “expenditure” under\n\nthe statutory definitions of those terms. Because the majority’s substantive analysis in\n\nthis case is the product of its erroneous interpretation of the statutory provisions at issue, I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n                                                           Michael F.

(dissenting).\n         I dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate this Court’s December 29, 2010,\n\nopinion because nothing in the plain language of MCL 169.257(1) prohibits a school\n\ndistrict from administering a payroll deduction system that allows Michigan Education\n\nAssociation (MEA) members to automatically send contributions to the MEA’s political\n\naction committee (MEA-PAC).1 Instead of preserving precedent, this newly comprised\n\nmajority reverses this Court’s previously issued opinion and issues its own opinion for no\n\nreason other than that it disagrees with the outcome of the prior opinion. Moreover,\n\nmembers of the current majority conspicuously fail to explain how this action differs\n\nfrom actions that they vehemently criticized just two short years ago.2 I would preserve\n\n\n\n1\n    The MEA-PAC is a segregated fund under MCL 169.255.\n2\n    Recall the words of now Chief Justice YOUNG just two years ago:\n\fthis Court’s December 29, 2010, opinion, which followed the language of the law,\n\nbecause a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system that remits funds\n\nto a segregated fund is not precluded by MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.\n\n                                       I. ANALYSIS\n\n         At issue is whether § 57 of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA), MCL\n\n169.257(1),3 prohibits a public school from administering a payroll deduction system that\n\nremits funds to the MEA-PAC. To interpret the MCFA, we must follow the established\n\nrules of statutory construction. “Assuming that the Legislature has acted within its\n\nconstitutional authority, the purpose of statutory construction is to discern and give effect\n\nto the intent of the Legislature.”4 Accordingly, a Court must interpret the language of a\n\nstatute in a manner that is consistent with the legislative intent.5     In determining the\n\nlegislative intent, the actual language of the statute must first be examined.6 “As far as\n\n\n                The facts have not changed. The text of the statute at issue has not\n         changed. The parties’ arguments have not changed. And the rationale\n         advanced in the opinions of this Court has not changed. Yet, within a\n         matter of months, a decision of this Court, thoughtfully briefed, argued, and\n         considered by seven justices, is no longer worth the paper it was written on.\n         Even the casual observer, however, does not really need to ask why. The\n         reason is obvious: . . . the composition of this Court changed.

The plain language of the statute\n\ndoes not prohibit any other activity. Therefore, if the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction system is not tantamount to doing one of these three things, the administration\n\nof the system is permissible under Michigan law.\n\n                                  A. EXPENDITURE\n\n      The first issue is whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem that remits funds to the MEA-PAC is an impermissible “expenditure” under § 57.\n\n“Expenditure” is specifically defined in the MCFA. The definition of “expenditure” is\n\nset forth in MCL 169.206, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n              (1) “Expenditure” means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of\n      payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods,\n      materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n      nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or\n      defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any\n      of the following:\n\n            (a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n      monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n      candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n                                        * * *\n\n             (2) Expenditure does not include any of the following:\n\n             (a) An expenditure for communication by a person with the person’s\n      paid members or shareholders and those individuals who can be solicited\n      for contributions to a separate segregated fund under [MCL 169.255].\n\n                                        * * *\n\n              (c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n      solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n      committee. [MCL 169.206 (emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f         The definition of “expenditure” is expansive. It includes a payment, donation,\n\nloan, or promise of payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for\n\ngoods, materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n\nnomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot\n\nquestion.     The definition also includes a contribution or a transfer of anything of\n\nascertainable monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. However, MCL\n\n169.206(2) also expressly excludes items from being classified as expenditures even\n\nthough they may qualify under the general definition outlined in MCL 169.206(1).\n\nNotably, any “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee” is specifically\n\nexcluded from the definition of “expenditure” by MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n\n         Turning to the facts of this case, the administration of a payroll deduction system\n\ndoes arguably provide services to the MEA and the MEA-PAC in facilitating payroll\n\ndeductions from members by providing personnel and computer services. The system\n\nallows MEA members to authorize the school to automatically deduct money from their\n\npaychecks and remit the funds to the MEA-PAC.               The MEA-PAC is a separate\n\nsegregated fund under MCL 169.255 because it has been established by the MEA, a labor\n\norganization, to make contributions to and expenditures on behalf of candidate\n\ncommittees, ballot question committees, political party committees, political committees,\n\nand independent committees.12 Thus, the payroll deduction system administers member\n\n12\n     MCL 169.255(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fcontributions to a separate segregated fund.          Although this process falls within the\n\ngeneral definition of “expenditure” under MCL 169.206(1), the administration of such a\n\nsystem is explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL 169.206(2)(c),\n\nwhich provides that an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation\n\nof contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee” is not an\n\n“expenditure.”13 A public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system falls\n\nsquarely within the statutory exception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member\n\ncontributions to their separate segregated fund, the MEA-PAC.                   Therefore, the\n\nadministration of the system is not an expenditure under the MCFA.\n\n           The majority erroneously asserts that the school district’s administration of a\n\npayroll deduction system is not an “administration . . . of contributions to a separate\n\nsegregated fund or independent committee”14 because the district is not administering a\n\nfund; rather, the district is only administering the payroll deduction system that remits\n\nfunds to the MEA-PAC. This argument is unfounded and contrary to the plain language\n\nof the statute.       The plain language of the statute applies to the administration of\n\n                  A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint\n           stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization\n           formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make\n           an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n           contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n           A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n           making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n           committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n           political committees, and independent committees.\n13\n     MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n14\n     Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcontributions to a separate segregated fund; the statute does not specify who has to make\n\nthe contributions. The MEA members’ contributions to the MEA-PAC are administered\n\nthrough the payroll deduction system. Thus, the district, by administering the payroll\n\ndeduction system, is administering contributions to the MEA-PAC, an action that is\n\nexplicitly allowed according to the plain language of the statute.\n\n       In sum, administration of a payroll deduction system is an “expenditure for the\n\nestablishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\nfund or independent committee” and thus falls within an enumerated exception to the\n\nstatutory definition of “expenditure.”     Therefore, the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction system is not an “expenditure” as defined by the MCFA and is not prohibited\n\nby § 57 on that ground.\n\n                                  B. CONTRIBUTION\n\n       The next issue is whether administration of the payroll deduction system is an\n\nimpermissible “contribution” under the MCFA. “Contribution,” like “expenditure,” is\n\nspecifically defined by the MCFA. The definition of “contribution” under the MCFA is\n\nset forth in MCL 169.204, which provides:\n\n               (1) “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n       expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n       loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n       a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made\n       for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or\n       for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n              (2) Contribution includes the full purchase price of tickets or\n       payment of an attendance fee for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies,\n       testimonials, and other fund-raising events; an individual’s own money or\n       property other than the individual’s homestead used on behalf of that\n\n\n                                             7\n\f         individual’s candidacy; the granting of discounts or rebates not available to\n         the general public; or the granting of discounts or rebates by broadcast\n         media and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for\n         the same office; and the endorsing or guaranteeing of a loan for the amount\n         the endorser or guarantor is liable.\n\n                (3) Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n                (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n         payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n         individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n         without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n         indirectly, repaid.\n\n               (b) Food and beverages, not to exceed $100.00 in value during a\n         calendar year, which are donated by an individual and for which\n         reimbursement is not given.\n\n               (c) An offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and\n         unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within\n         30 business days after receipt. [Emphasis added.]\n\n         The definition of “contribution” includes the term “expenditure.”            Because\n\n“expenditure” is explicitly defined by the MCFA, the statutory definition controls.15 As\n\nexplained earlier, the administration of a payroll deduction system is not an\n\n“expenditure” under the MCFA and thus cannot be a contribution on that basis. The only\n\nother way that the administration of the system could be a “contribution” under the\n\nMCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a “transfer of anything of\n\nascertainable monetary value . . . made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or\n\nelection of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n         The majority argues that the actual and intangible costs associated with the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system constitute a contribution because there is a\n\n15\n     Tryc, 451 Mich at 136.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\ftransfer of something of ascertainable monetary value from the school district to the\n\nMEA-PAC and the transfer, although made pursuant to a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, is made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The majority\n\nasserts that the resources expended to administer the payroll deduction system have an\n\nascertainable monetary value, and the fact that they are expended for the benefit of the\n\nMEA-PAC conveys value to the MEA-PAC.                  The majority further argues that\n\nprepayment for the services does not negate the transfer because MEA-PAC still receives\n\nthe benefit of the services.\n\n         I disagree with this interpretation of the word “transfer” in the statute. Because\n\n“transfer” is a nontechnical word that is not defined within the statute, the proper course\n\nof action is to first look to the plain meaning of the term to ascertain what the Legislature\n\nintended by using “transfer” to define a “contribution.”16 “Transfer” is defined as “to\n\nconvey or remove from one place, person, etc., to another.”17 In order for there to be a\n\ncontribution, “anything of ascertainable monetary value” must be conveyed from one\n\nentity to another.\n\n         There are two possible interpretations of the word “transfer” in the statute. The\n\nfirst interpretation would require that any conveyance of value for services provided to a\n\ncampaign, regardless of whether the services are paid for, would constitute a\n\n\n16\n MCL 8.3a; Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs v Mich Prop & Cas Guaranty Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741734/oakland-county-bd-v-mich-property-cas-guar/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998).\n17\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fcontribution. The second would require a net conveyance of value in order to be a\n\n“transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value.” I believe that the latter is the only\n\nlogical interpretation. Any other interpretation of “contribution” would lead to an absurd\n\nresult, and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results.18 For example, under the\n\nmajority’s interpretation, a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the normal\n\ncourse of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because it has\n\ntransferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even though the shop has been\n\ncompensated for the cost of providing the signage.             Such an interpretation of\n\n“contribution” defies common sense, and I do not read the statute in this manner.\n\nInstead, I conclude that the statute requires a net conveyance of “anything of monetary\n\nvalue” in order for there to be a campaign contribution. If costs for administering the\n\npayroll deduction system are paid in advance, there is no net conveyance of anything of\n\nmonetary value, and there is no contribution.\n\n         Furthermore, my conclusion that a “contribution” under MCL 169.204(1) requires\n\na net transfer of value comports with the remainder of that section, which specifically\n\nexcludes from the statutory definition of “contribution” any “contribution if expressly and\n\nunconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business\n\ndays after receipt.” MCL 169.204(3)(c). In other words, if the contribution is rejected,\n\nreturned, or refunded, it is no longer a “contribution” under the MCFA. Moreover, MCL\n\n169.204(2) explains that a “contribution” includes “the granting of discounts or rebates\n\nnot available to the general public . . . .” This implies that when an entity provides\n\n18\n     McAuley v Gen Motors Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1300171\"><a href=\"/opinion/1300171/mcauley-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fproducts or services at full price, the entity is not making a contribution. Thus, the statute\n\nclearly requires that there be a net transfer of value in order for there to be a contribution\n\nunder the MCFA.\n\n         The majority erroneously asserts that the payroll deduction system constitutes\n\nsomething of “ascertainable monetary value” because there is inherent value to the MEA-\n\nPAC in having payroll deductions automatically taken from members’ wages as opposed\n\nto requiring individual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. This argument ignores the plain\n\ndefinition of the term “ascertainable.” “Ascertainable” is also a nontechnical word that is\n\nnot defined within the statute, so we must look to the ordinary meaning of the word to\n\ndiscern what the Legislature intended. “Ascertain” is defined as “to find out definitely;\n\nlearn with certainty or assurance.”19 Thus, the phrase “ascertainable monetary value” in\n\nthe statute requires that the monetary value conferred be determined definitely, with\n\ncertainty and assurance. The majority hypothetically opines that the intangible benefits\n\nthe union receives because of the payroll deduction system confers something of\n\nascertainable monetary value. The majority reasons that ascertainable monetary value is\n\nself-evident from the fact that the defendant has bargained for the payroll deduction\n\nsystem in its contract with the school district and has appealed the right to enforce the\n\nprovision in this Court. However, these actions do not definitely identify with certainty\n\nthe amount of monetary value that the payroll deduction system confers to the MEA.\n\nTherefore, according to the terms of the statute, the intangible benefits conferred to the\n\n\n\n19\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fMEA by the administration of a payroll deduction system do not constitute a\n\n“contribution.”\n\n       In this instance, the MEA plans to prepay the school district for all ascertainable\n\ncosts—those which are definitely and certainly identified—associated with the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system, and in fact asked the Secretary of State for\n\na declaratory ruling regarding the costs to be prepaid. Thus, the administration of the\n\npayroll deduction system will not result in a net transfer of anything of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value as all costs will be ascertained and prepaid.\n\n       The majority also erroneously asserts that the payroll deduction system constitutes\n\nan “in-kind contribution” under MCL 169.209(3) as a “contribution . . . other than\n\nmoney.”    Again, the majority identifies the hypothetical intangible benefits that the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system confers on the MEA as the impermissible\n\ncontributions. However, this argument ignores that an in-kind contribution must still be a\n\n“contribution” as defined by the statute. The hypothetical intangible benefits are not\n\ncontributions because, as discussed, they do not have an ascertainable monetary value.\n\nThe MEA contemplates prepaying all costs associated with the administration of the\n\ndeduction system that can be ascertained. Accordingly, there is no contribution under the\n\nMCFA, and a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not\n\nprohibited by § 57 on that ground.\n\n                       C. VOLUNTEER PERSONAL SERVICES\n\n       The final issue is whether the administration of the system in question\n\nimpermissibly “provide[s] volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fdefinition of contribution under section 4(3)(a)” of the MCFA. As noted earlier, § 4(3)\n\nprovides:\n\n               Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n                (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n         payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n         individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n         without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n         indirectly, repaid. [MCL 169.204(3).]\n\n         Although such services are thus not considered a contribution for purposes of the\n\nrest of the MCFA, § 57 specifically indicates that public bodies cannot use public\n\nresources to provide volunteer services that are not compensated.             However, the\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction system at issue does not involve volunteer\n\nservices by public employees because the MEA intends to prepay for all services\n\nrendered. Because volunteer services are not defined by the statute, again the proper\n\ncourse of action is to look to the plain meaning of the terms to discern the legislative\n\nintent. “Volunteer” is defined as “a person who performs a service willingly and without\n\npay.”20 Willingness to perform an activity is not enough to fall within the scope of this\n\nsubsection; the activity must also be performed without pay. In this case, the MEA fully\n\nanticipates payment and plans to prepay for any administration costs. As a result, a\n\npublic school’s administration of a payroll deduction system does not “provide volunteer\n\npersonal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section\n\n4(3)(a)” of the MCFA and is not prohibited by § 57 on this final ground. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n20\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997), def 2.\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fadministration of a payroll deduction system by a public school is permitted under the\n\nMCFA.\n\n                                    II. CONCLUSION\n\n       I dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate this Court’s December 29, 2010,\n\nopinion. A public school may administer payroll deductions for its employees who remit\n\nfunds to the MEA-PAC because MCL 169.257(1) only prohibits a public body from\n\nusing public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a\n\ncontribution, and (3) provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\ndefinition of “contribution” under MCL 169.204(3)(a). The administration of the system\n\nat issue does not meet any of those criteria. Thus, the administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction system is permitted under the MCFA, and the Court of Appeals erred by\n\nconcluding that it is not. Accordingly, I dissent.\n\n\n                                                     Diane M. Hathaway\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f</pre>",
