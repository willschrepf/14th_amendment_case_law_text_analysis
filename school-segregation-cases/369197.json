The history of this case is well documented by the district court.  Acree, et al. v. Drummond, et al. v. County Board of Education of Richmond County, Georgia, et al., 336 F.Supp. 1275 (S.D., Ga., 1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The County Board of Education and Intervenors raise numerous objections to the desegregation plan being implemented by the district court, most of which do not even merit discussion.  The major contention is that the district court erred in requiring \"forced bussing\" to achieve racial balance in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and of Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), the Court made quite clear that bussing is an available tool for use by district courts in achieving school desegregation.  In the instant case the district court utilized this tool along with the pairing, clustering and zoning methods long authorized by the Supreme Court and this court.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra; Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971); Boykins v.

The district court should not, and did not permit the use of such platitudes to perpetuate a dual school system, nor could it permit defendants to rely on the inferiority of certain school facilities to which children were to be transferred as a justification for continued racial discrimination.  The Court in Swann stated unequivocally:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>\"In default by the school authorities of their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies, a district court has broad power to fashion a remedy that will assure a unitary school system. 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at 1276.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Richmond County Board of Education has operated and continues to operate a de jure as well as a de facto segregated system, and has long been under order to desegregate.  See Acree v. County Board of Education of Richmond County, Ga., 399 F.2d 151 (5th Cir., 1968).
