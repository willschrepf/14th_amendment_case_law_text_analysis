We conclude that the government may reasonably\ndraw a distinction between convictions vacated for rehabilitative\npurposes and those vacated because of underlying defects in the\ncriminal proceedings, and we establish a categorical test to\nguide this determination. Applying this test, we will reverse the\njudgment of the District Court.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n       Petitioner Gummersindo Pinho, a native of Portugal, is\nmarried to a United States citizen with whom he has two\nchildren, who are also U.S. citizens. In February 1992, Pinho\nwas arrested and charged with three third-degree drug offenses\nunder New Jersey law: possession of cocaine (“Count I”),\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine (“Count II”), and\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine on or near school\nproperty (“Count III”). Because he had no prior criminal record,\nPinho applied for admission into New Jersey’s “Pre-Trial\nIntervention” program (“PTI”), under which criminal\nproceedings would be postponed pending Pinho’s completion of\na rehabilitation program, at which point the charges would be\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fdropped. Admission into PTI did not require an admission of\nguilt.1\n\n      1\n       The PTI program worked in 1992 just as it does today:\nonce a defendant is accepted, the judge postpones all\nproceedings against him for at most thirty-six months, after\nwhich the judge must either dismiss the indictment, postpone\nproceedings further, or restore proceedings. With respect to\ndismissal, the relevant rule provides:\n\n      On the recommendation of the program director\n      and with the consent of the prosecutor and the\n      defendant, [“the designated judge shall”] dismiss\n      the complaint, indictment or accusation against\n      the defendant, such a dismissal to be designated\n      ‘matter adjusted - complaint (or indictment or\n      accusation) dismissed.’\n\nN.J. Rules Governing Criminal Practice, Rule 3-28 (1992\nversion).\n\n       The New Jersey Supreme Court has issued guidelines for\noperation of PTI. Guideline 4 provides: “Enrollment in PTI\nprograms should be conditioned upon neither informal\nadmission nor entry of a plea of guilty. Enrollment of\ndefendants who maintain their innocence should be permitted\nunless the defendant’s attitude would render pre-trial\nintervention ineffective.”   The accompanying comment\nprovided:\n\n      A PTI program is presented to defendants as an\n\n                             4\n\f       Pinho’s application to PTI was rejected, however. At the\ntime, the local state prosecutor’s office, acting in accordance\nwith a directive of the state Attorney General, had a per se rule\nagainst accepting into PTI any defendant against whom there\nwas a viable case for possession with intent to distribute drugs\nat or near a school. See State v. Caliguri, 726 A.2d 912, 921\n(N.J. 1999). This rule was later invalidated by the New Jersey\nSupreme Court as contravening the purposes of the statute\ngoverning PTI. Id. Under the New Jersey Rules, appeal of\ndenials of PTI applications was permitted only following a\nconviction or guilty plea. N.J. Rules Governing Criminal\nPractice Rule 3.28(f), (g) (1992 version).\n\n       On August 17, 1992, Pinho pleaded guilty to Count I,\npossession of cocaine. He was represented at the time of the\nplea by the same attorney who helped him apply to PTI. Counts\nII and III were dismissed. Pinho’s sentence was two years’\n\n\n       opportunity to earn a dismissal of charges for\n       social reasons and reasons of present and future\n       behavior, legal guilt or innocence\n       notwithstanding. . . . Within the context of\n       pretrial intervention, when and whether guilt\n       should be admitted is a decision for\n       counselors. . . . Neither admission of guilt nor\n       acknowledgment or responsibility is required.\n       Steps to bar participation solely on such grounds\n       would be an unwarranted discrimination.\n\nN.J. Rules Governing Criminal Practice, Rule 3-28, Guideline\n4, Comment (1992 version).\n\n                               5\n\fprobation, a substance abuse evaluation, an assessment of\n$1,080, and the loss of his driving privileges for six months.\n\n        On June 2, 1997, some five years later, and after he had\nserved his sentence, Pinho, now represented by different\ncounsel, applied for post-conviction relief in New Jersey\nSuperior Court, contending that he had received ineffective\nassistance of counsel in connection with his rejection from PTI.\nThe motion was timely, see N.J. Court Rule 3.22-12(a)\n(providing that motions for post-conviction relief are timely\nwithin five years). In the motion, Pinho alleged that his prior\ncounsel had failed to ascertain whether the conduct underlying\nCount III had actually occurred near a school. It is undisputed\nthat while the building had previously been a school, it was, at\nthe time of the alleged crime, in fact not a school, but rather a\nmaintenance and storage building. Pinho contended that, had\nthis fact been known, he would not have been deemed ineligible\nfor PTI through the operation of the per se rule.2 New Jersey\ncourts have held that counsel’s failure to establish PTI eligibility\ncan support ineffective assistance claims. See State v. Marrero,\n\n\n       2\n        Eligibility, of course, does not guarantee acceptance,\nwhich remained in the prosecutor’s discretion. Because of the\noperation of the rule, though, Pinho was never even considered.\nSo while he might eventually have been rejected even with\neffective assistance of counsel, he would not have been rejected\nbecause of the rule. In this respect, Pinho’s 1992 PTI\napplication mirrors his 2000 adjustment of status application. In\neach case a non-discretionary eligibility determination served as\nthe gatekeeper for a discretionary action.\n\n                                 6\n\f383 A.2d 131, 132 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1978); State v. Cruz,\nNo. A-5184-02T5 (N.J. Super. Ct. 2004) (unpublished).\n\n       The state did not file an answer to Pinho’s motion, and\nthe court held a hearing on his claim on March 10, 1998. At that\nhearing, the court observed:\n\n       [The parties] have been dealing with this matter\n       for several months, the upshot of which was that\n       there would be an application by Mr. Pinho to P-\n       T-I. If acceptable then the matter would be\n       dismissed once he was placed in P-T-I – and since\n       Mr. Pinho has been accepted into P-T-I, I think\n       the previous judgment of conviction can be\n       vacated.\n\nTranscript at 3, New Jersey v. Pinho, No.1009-6-92 (N.J. Super.\nCt. Mar. 10, 1998).3 The prosecutor responded, “Very good,\nJudge, I move for that dismissal if need be.” Id. By letter dated\n\n       3\n         The record does not contain a vacatur order other than\nthis statement from the bench. It is not disputed, however, that\nthe conviction was in fact vacated. Whether the subsequent\ndismissal order may be treated as an imiplicit vacatur order, or\nwhether the judge’s statement from the bench was itself the\nvacatur order is of little moment. A paper record merely\nmemorializes a judicial act, and the record is clear that the\njudicial act was carried out:         Pinho’s conviction was\n“dismiss[ed], cancel[ed] . . . discharge[d] or otherwise\nremove[d].” Sandoval v. I.N.S., 240 F.3d 577, 583 (7th Cir.\n2001).\n\n                               7\n\fMay 1, 1998, the prosecutor’s office consented to Pinho’s\nadmission to PTI. The letter explained that “[t]his approval is\nbased upon the facts and circumstances of this case and this\ndefendant.” Letter from John N. Shaughnessy, Assistant\nProsecutor, County of Middlesex, New Jersey, to Ronald W.\nReba (May 1, 1998). All charges against Pinho were then\ndismissed by order dated May 21, 1998. The order provided:\n\n      Upon application of Pretrial Intervention Program\n      for an Order to dismiss the above captioned . . .\n      indictments . . . pursuant to Rule 3:28 . . . the\n      Court having considered the report of the Pretrial\n      Intervention Program concerning the defendant’s\n      participation. . . . It is on this 21st day of May\n      1998 ORDERED that the . . . indictments . . . [be]\n      dismissed . . . [and] the clerk . . . is hereby\n      directed to mark the court record “Complaint\n      dismissed – matter adjusted.’\n\nOrder of Dismissal, New Jersey v. Pinho, No. 1009-6-92 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. May 21, 1998).\n\n                              B.\n\n       In January 2000, Pinho applied to the Newark District\nOffice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”)\nfor an adjustment of his immigration status to “permanent\nresident” under 8 U.S.C. § 1255, based upon his marriage to a\nU.S. citizen. In a decision dated December 11, 2000, the INS\ndenied adjustment on the ground that Pinho was inadmissible to\nthe United States under 8 U.S.C. § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), which\n\n                              8\n\fprovides that “any alien convicted of, or who admits having\ncommitted, or who admits committing acts which constitute the\nessential elements of a violation of . . . any law or regulation of\na State . . . relating to a controlled substance . . . is\ninadmissible.”4 The agency reasoned that Pinho’s 1992 plea to\nCount I in New Jersey met the definition of “conviction” in\n§ 1011(a)(48)(A). That section provides:\n\n       The term ‘conviction’ means, with respect to an\n       alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien\n       entered by a court, or, if adjudication of guilt has\n       been withheld, where (i) a judge or jury has found\n       the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of\n       guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted\n       sufficient facts to warrant a finding or guilt, and\n\n       4\n       Neither the Newark District Office, the Office of\nAdministrative Appeals, the District Court, nor the government\non appeal, analyzes 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C), which provides\nthat\n\n       [a]ny alien who the consular or immigration\n       officer knows or has reason to believe is or has\n       been an illicit trafficker in any such controlled\n       substance or is or has been a knowing assister,\n       abettor, conspirator, or colluder with others in the\n       illicit trafficking in any such controlled substance,\n       is inadmissible.\n\nWe therefore express no opinion on how that provision would\napply in this case.\n\n                                9\n\f       (ii) the judge has ordered some form of\n       punishment, penalty or restraint on the alien’s\n       liberty to be imposed.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the agency relied heavily upon a Board\nof Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decision, In re Roldan, 22 I. &\nN. Dec. 512 (B.I.A. 1999), in which the agency had held that\n“an alien is considered convicted for immigration purposes upon\nthe initial satisfaction of the requirements of [8 U.S.C. §\n1101(a)(48)(A)] and that he remains convicted notwithstanding\na subsequent state action purporting to erase all evidence of the\noriginal determination of guilt through a rehabilitative\nprocedure.” Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 523. The Newark\nDistrict Director certified his decision to the Associate\nCommissioner for Examinations; the Associate Commissioner\naffirmed on June 28, 2001. The INS Office of Administrative\nAppeals affirmed on July 25, 2002.\n\n                               C.\n\n       On December 31, 2003, Pinho and his wife filed a\ncomplaint in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe denial of his adjustment of status was arbitrary, capricious\nand unlawful because his vacated state conviction should no\nlonger be a bar to his eligibility for adjustment.5\n\n       5\n        On June 30, 2004, and in the context of the previously\nfiled action, Pinho filed a motion for injunctive relief, seeking\nan order directing the Newark office to grant him an\nemployment authorization form, which was required by New\nJersey for renewal of his driver’s license. Pinho argued that\n\n                               10\n\f        Pinho’s argument in the District Court hinged on the\nstatus of his conviction under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A). The\nBIA interprets § 1101(a)(48)(A) to draw a distinction between\nconvictions vacated because of the immigrant’s subsequent\nparticipation in a rehabilitation program, and convictions\nvacated because of underlying substantive or constitutional\ndefects. See In re Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621 (B.I.A. 2003).\nPinho argued that his conviction had been vacated in settlement\nof his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, rather than as part\nof a rehabilitation program. Pinho relied largely on three cases:\nHerrera-Iniro v. INS, 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir. 2000), In re\nRodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1378 (B.I.A. 2000), and\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 621.\n\n       In Herrera-Iniro, an immigrant argued that his prior\nconviction should not be operative for immigration purposes,\nalthough he conceded that it had been vacated through a\n\n\ndenial of the authorization form was contrary to the applicable\nregulation governing eligibility, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(9). The\nparties agree that the employment authorization has been\ngranted, mooting any injunctive relief we might order. See\nLetter from Thomas E. Moseley to Marcia Waldron, Clerk of\nthe Court, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,\nSep. 9, 2005; letter from Christopher J. Christie, United States\nAttorney for the District of New Jersey, to Marcia Waldron,\nClerk of the Court, United States Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit, Sep. 9, 2005. We therefore do not have properly before\nus the question of whether the agency violated 8 C.F.R.\n§ 274a.12(c)(9) when it denied his application for employment\nauthorization.\n\n                                11\n\frehabilitative program. The court reviewed the legislative\nhistory of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), and rejected the argument, noting\nthat “[t]he emphasis that Congress placed on the original\nadmission of guilt plainly indicates that a subsequent dismissal\nof charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the\nmerits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal\nproceedings, does not vitiate that original admission.” Herrera-\nIniro, 208 F.3d at 306 (emphasis added).\n\n        In Rodriguez-Ruiz, decided a few months after Herrera-\nIniro, the BIA suspended the termination proceedings of an\nimmigrant who had pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual abuse\nunder New York law. Months after the plea, the court that had\nentered the plea entered an order explicitly vacating it; its order\nstated:\n\n       It is ORDERED, that pursuant to CPL 440,[6] the\n       judgment had in this Court on March 24, 1999\n       based upon a plea colloquy . . . convicting said\n       Defendant of the crime of Sexual Abuse 3rd and\n       the sentence of one (1) year probation are in all\n       respects vacated, on the legal merits, as if said\n       conviction had never occurred and the matter is\n       restored to the docket for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n       Article 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law,\nN.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 440, pertains to post-judgment motions.\n\n                                12\n\fRodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 1379. The government\nargued that this was merely a Roldan situation; the BIA\ndisagreed:\n\n       [W]e find that the order of the New York court\n       does not constitute a state action which purports\n       to expunge, dismiss, cancel, vacate, discharge, or\n       otherwise remove a guilty plea or other record of\n       guilt or conviction by operation of a state\n       rehabilitative statute. The New York criminal\n       law provision under which the respondent’s\n       conviction was vacated is neither an expungement\n       statute nor a rehabilitative statute.\n\nId. at 1379-80 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added).7\n\n       Finally, in Matter of Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621\n(B.I.A. 2003), the BIA explicitly endorsed the distinction\nsuggested in Herrera-Iniro. After reviewing the existing legal\nlandscape, the BIA held:\n\n       In accord with the federal court opinions applying\n       the definition of a conviction at section\n       101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, we find that there is a\n       significant distinction between convictions\n       vacated on the basis of a procedural or substantive\n\n       7\n       The BIA refused, as the government urged, to “go\nbehind” the state court judgment and question whether the state\ncourt had followed its own laws in entering the vacatur.\nRodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 1379.\n\n                               13\n\f       defect in the underlying proceedings and those\n       vacated because of post-conviction events, such\n       as rehabilitation or immigration hardships. Thus,\n       if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction\n       based on a defect in the underlying criminal\n       proceedings, the respondent no longer has a\n       “conviction” within the meaning of section\n       101(a)(48)(A). If, however, a court vacates a\n       conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of\n       the underlying criminal proceedings, the\n       respondent remains “convicted” for immigration\n       purposes.\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.\n\n       The District Court deemed Pinho’s vacated conviction a\n“conviction” for immigration purposes, reasoning that “Pinho\npled guilty in 1992, served his sentence and now asks this Court\nto ignore Congressional intent and case law to order the\n[Department of Homeland Security] to grant him an\nemployment authorization form. Based on these facts, this\nCourt cannot grant [Pinho’s] request.” Pinho v. Ashcroft, No.\n03cv6232, at 11 (D.N.J. Aug. 9, 2004). Expressing its suspicion\nthat Pinho’s ineffective assistance claim was simply an attempt\nto engineer a better position on his adjustment of status\napplication, the District Court granted the government’s motion\nfor summary judgment, and Pinho appealed.\n\n                              II.\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f        Neither the parties nor the District Court questioned\nwhether jurisdiction existed in that court, so we must therefore\nconsider the question anew. See Soltane v. Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, 381 F.3d 143 (2004) (“[W]e are required\nto consider the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, even though\nneither party contends that it is lacking here.”) (citing Bender v.\nWilliamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986)). The\nagency decision at issue here was made by the Bureau of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“BICE”)8 Newark\nDistrict Office, and affirmed by the BICE Administrative\nAppeals Office (“AAO”). There was no hearing before an\nImmigration Judge (“IJ”), and no appeal to the BIA. We must\nascertain whether the District Court had jurisdiction to review\na decision by the AAO in these circumstances, and if so,\nwhether it had jurisdiction to review this particular decision.\nWe hold that on these facts the District Court had jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and Section 704 of the Administrative\nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 704, to review the AAO’s\ndetermination of Pinho’s statutory eligibility for adjustment of\nstatus.\n\n       8\n        On March 1, 2003, the INS’s functions were transferred\nto the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(“BICE”) and the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service\n(“USCIS”) of the United States Department of Homeland\nSecurity (“DHS”). See Knapik v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 84, 86 n.2\n(3d Cir. 2004) (citing Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.\nNo. 107-296, §§ 441, 451 & 471, 116 Stat. 2135, codified at 6\nU.S.C. §§ 251, 271 & 291). Faced with this profusion of\nadministrative bodies, we will adopt “the agency” as shorthand\nfor the DHS and its sub-units.\n\n                                15\n\f        To support APA jurisdiction, the agency action must be\nfinal, it must adversely affect the party seeking review, and it\nmust be non-discretionary.9 We consider these requirements in\nturn.\n\n        Jurisdiction under the APA is available for review of\n“final agency action.” The Supreme Court has explained the\nfinality requirement as follows:\n\n       As a general matter, two conditions must be\n       satisfied for agency action to be “final”: First, the\n       action must mark the “consummation” of the\n       agency’s decisionmaking process, Chicago &\n       Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp.,\n       333 U.S. 103, 113, 92 L. Ed. 568, 68 S. Ct. 431\n       (1948)--it must not be of a merely tentative or\n       interlocutory nature. And second, the action must\n       be one by which “rights or obligations have been\n       determined,” or from which “legal consequences\n       will flow,” Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn.\n       v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62,\n       71, 27 L. Ed. 2d 203, 91 S. Ct. 203 (1970).\n\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997). The agency action\nat issue here satisfies these two conditions.\n\n\n       9\n        Section 1252(a)(2)(B) of Title 8 of the United States\nCode, which also strips the district courts of jurisdiction over\ndiscretionary agency determinations, is in that respect at least\npartly duplicative of the APA requirement.\n\n                                16\n\f        Finality requires exhaustion of administrative remedies.\nIf there remain steps that the immigrant can take to have an\naction reviewed within the agency, then the action is not final\nand judicial review is premature. In this case, the agency\noffered no further procedures that Pinho could invoke to have\nhis claim of statutory eligibility heard. There is no provision for\nBIA review of an AAO status-adjustment eligibility decision.\nSee 8 CFR § 3.1(b). If the agency institutes removal\nproceedings against an immigrant, then the immigrant may\nrenew his or her application during those proceedings, 8 C.F.R.\n§ 245.2, but we do not find this possibility sufficient to render\nthe AAO’s eligibility determination “tentative or interlocutory”\nin this case.\n\n       The reason is simple: if the agency does not seek to\ndeport the immigrant, there can never be an appeal within the\nagency by which any higher level of administrative authority\ncan be invoked to review the legal determination made by the\nAAO. Because applications for adjustment of status can be\nrenewed, and are often made in the first instance, during\ndeportation proceedings, those proceedings will in some cases\naddress the issues considered by the AAO, see, e.g., Herrera-\nInirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299, 303 (1st Cir. 2000) (question\nwhether vacated conviction constituted “conviction” under §\n1011(a)(48)(A) addressed during deportation hearing), so that\njudicial review would be barred, see, e.g., Howell v. INS, 72\nF.3d 288, 293 (2d Cir. 1995) (finding jurisdiction lacking once\ndeportation proceedings had begun).10 However, in this case,\n\n       10\n         The cursory treatment of exhaustion by the Seventh\nCircuit in McBrearty v. Perryman, 212 F.3d 985 (7th Cir. 2000),\n\n                                17\n\fPinho’s adjustment of status application was not filed because\nof pending deportation proceedings, but rather because of his\nmarriage to a U.S. citizen. Because the Department of\n\n\nis not on point. In that case, the plaintiffs “sought judicial\nreview of the refusal by the district director of the immigration\nservice to adjust their status. . . .” Id. at 986 (emphasis added).\nThe Seventh Circuit dismissed the complaint for want of\njurisdiction on the ground that “[t]he suit was premature, since,\nas the plaintiffs acknowledge, they could obtain review of the\ndistrict director’s decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals\nif and when the immigration service institutes removal (i.e.\ndeportation) proceedings against them. They have thus failed to\nexhaust their administrative remedies.” Id. (internal citation\nomitted). But the Seventh Circuit confuses the existence of a\nclaim with the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The\nMcBrearty plaintiffs were not challenging a legal determination\nof their statutory eligibility for adjustment, but rather a refusal\nto adjust their status. This distinction makes all the difference.\nThe refusal to adjust – a discretionary determination – was (as\nthe court notes) barred by § 1252(a)(2)(B). While it is true that\nthe plaintiffs could have renewed their adjustment application in\nremoval proceedings, that fact is irrelevant to the District\nCourt’s lack of jurisdiction: under Section 1252(a)(2)(B) the\ncourt had no jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had no claim at\nall, not because they had failed to exhaust a valid claim.\nMcBrearty is not about exhaustion, and is redeemed from\nmaking law without proper analysis only by its facts; it surely\ncannot be said to stand for the proposition that immigrants\nstating a legal claim – one not barred by § 1252 – must always\nwait for deportation proceedings.\n\n                                18\n\fHomeland Security (“DHS”) did not provide an avenue for\nadministrative appeal of the AAO decision, Pinho had no further\nopportunity to challenge the legality of the decision within the\nagency, and would have none at all, were he forced to await\ndeportation proceedings that the agency may or may not choose\nto institute. In Howell, the Second Circuit left open the question\nof jurisdiction where there were no pending deportation\nproceedings in which the immigrant could raise her adjustment\nclaims. Subsequently, the district court in Chen v. Reno, 1997\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 8072 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), was faced with that\nquestion – the question we are faced with in this case. In Chen,\nthe District Court found that jurisdiction did lie, explaining:\n\n       A litigant has a right to a prompt resolution of\n       decisions concerning his status affording him the\n       opportunity to make personal, educational, or\n       career plans. . . . Chen has exhausted his\n       administrative remedies because as a denied\n       applicant not in deportation proceedings, he has\n       no further options under the regulatory or\n       statutory scheme to force a prompt decision by the\n       INS.\n\nId. at *6-7.\n\n        In our view, Chen is a proper application of the guidance\ngiven by the Supreme Court in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137\n(1993), and McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140 (1992). Darby\nheld that agency action is final when the “aggrieved party has\nexhausted all administrative remedies expressly prescribed by\nstatute or agency rule. . . . [W]here the APA applies, an appeal\n\n                               19\n\fto ‘superior agency authority’ is a prerequisite to judicial review\nonly when expressly required by statute or when an\nadministrative rule requires appeal before review and the\nadministrative action is made inoperative pending that review.”\nDarby, 509 U.S. at 154. In the case at bar, not only was there no\nadministrative remedy “expressly prescribed,” but the applicable\nregulation expressly provided that there was no administrative\nappeal available. And the AAO’s decision was “operative”\nfrom the moment it was entered. A ruling that Pinho must wait\nfor possible future deportation proceedings in order to challenge\nthe AAO’s legal determination would sit ill at ease with Darby.\n\n        We hold that an AAO decision is final where there are no\ndeportation proceedings pending in which the decision might be\nreopened or challenged. But even if the possibility of renewing\nan adjustment application in future deportation proceedings\nwere thought to cast doubt on the finality of an AAO decision,\nthis case falls into one of the categories “in which the interests\nof the individual weigh heavily against requiring administrative\nexhaustion,” McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 146, namely, circumstances\nin which an “indefinite timeframe for administrative action,” id.\nat 147, results in prejudice to the individual who must await that\naction. The decision whether or not to institute deportation\nproceedings is entirely within the discretion of the agency.\nThere are no steps that Pinho can take to force the question in\norder to have his claim resolved. If the only route to the courts\nis through deportation proceedings, then the agency retains sole\ncontrol over whether an individual’s purely legal claim – one\nwhich has not been made non-reviewable by statute – may ever\n\n\n\n\n                                20\n\fbe brought before the courts.11 Such a result would be plainly\nat odds not only with the APA, but also with broader principles\nof separation of powers.12\n\n       11\n          The Fifth Circuit, in Cardoso v. Reno, 216 F.3d 512\n(5th Cir. 2000), held that denials of adjustment of status may\nreach the courts only through review of deportation proceedings.\nBecause the court did not attempt to distinguish between denials\nof adjustment of status applications, and legal determinations of\neligibility for status adjustment, it is not clear whether the\nCardoso holding has much to do with the case at hand here. In\nCardoso, the court considered three separate jurisdictional\ndismissals of immigration claims. One of them involved a claim\nthat an application for adjustment of status had been wrongly\ndenied as a matter of law. The applicant had filed for\nadjustment prior to her twenty-first birthday. However, the\nagency did not rule on the application for three years, at which\npoint it denied the application on the grounds that the applicant\nwas no longer eligible because she was no longer a minor. Id.\nat 514. The court held that the applicant could not invoke\njudicial review because the agency decision was not final,\nalthough it conceded that there were no deportation proceedings\npending against the applicant. Id. at 518. We think it important\nas a matter of administrative law to distinguish between\n(reviewable) non-discretionary legal determinations, and (non-\nreviewable) discretionary determinations. Because the Fifth\nCircuit did not do so, we cannot tell with certainty whether we\nare in conflict on the question resolved in this case.\n       12\n       See, e.g., Cynthia R. Farina, Statutory Interpretation\nand the Balance of Power in the Administrative State, 89\n\n                               21\n\f       It is also apparent that legal consequences flow directly\nfrom the determination that Pinho was not eligible for\nadjustment of status because of his prior conviction. In addition\nto the ineligibility determination itself, which prevented him\nfrom being considered for adjustment, the AAO’s ruling had as\na direct result the subsequent denial by the District Office of\nPinho’s application for employment authorization. That\nauthorization was required, inter alia, for the renewal of Pinho’s\ndriver’s license and for his continued employment. Both the\nagency’s obligations – to consider Pinho’s application for\nadjustment – and Pinho’s rights – to be considered for\nadjustment, and to renew his driver’s license – were determined\nby the AAO’s ruling. The determination itself and the denial of\nthe employment authorization are clear adverse effects, and raise\nthe possibility that Pinho “may suffer irreparable harm if unable\nto secure immediate judicial consideration of his claim,”\n\n\nColum. L. Rev. 452, 495-96 (1989) (“By the time of the\nratification, the prevailing understanding of separation of\npowers was no longer a simplistic call for absolute segregation\nof conceptually distinct functions. The experience between\nindependence and the Constitutional Convention had caused\nAmerican political theorists to rethink the nature of\ngovernmental authority. They came to conclude that . . . all\npower in government shared the same fundamental quality: it\nwas dangerous unless adequately offset and controlled. And so\n. . . the words ‘separation of powers’ came to connote something\nfar more subtle and intricate than a mere, abstractly logical\ndivision. The phrase expressed the expectation that, through the\ncarefully orchestrated disposition and sharing of authority,\nrestraint would be found in power counterbalancing power.”).\n\n                               22\n\fMcCarthy, 503 U.S. at 147, if he is prohibited from driving or\nworking while awaiting the uncertain possibility of future\nagency proceedings.\n\n        We must also ask whether the action at issue here was\ndiscretionary. It is important to distinguish carefully between a\ndenial of an application to adjust status, and a determination that\nan immigrant is legally ineligible for adjustment of status. This\ndistinction is central to the question of subject-matter\njurisdiction, and is easy to elide. Indeed, such distinctions are\ncrucial to administrative law generally; the framework of\njudicial review of agency action that has evolved over the past\nhalf-century is grounded in a sharp distinction between\ndecisions committed to agency discretion, and decisions,\nwhether “ministerial” or “purely legal,” governed directly by the\napplicable statute or regulation. See, e.g., Norton v. Southern\nUtah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55 (2004); Webster v. Doe,\n486 U.S. 592 (1988). Whatever the label, our caselaw\ndistinguishes between actions which an agency official may\nfreely decide to take or not to take, and those which he is\nobligated by law to take or not to take. In the case of adjustment\nof status, an eligible immigrant may have his application denied\nwithin the discretion of the agency. But the immigrant’s\neligibility itself is determined by statute. To treat all denials of\nadjustment as discretionary, even when based on eligibility\ndeterminations that are plainly matters of law, is to\nfundamentally misunderstand the relationship between the\nexecutive and the judiciary.\n\n      In Soltane, 381 F.3d at 143, we considered the question\nwhether an AAO determination of statutory eligibility for a\n\n                                23\n\fparticular immigration classification is discretionary. We held\nthat it is not. In that case, Camphill Soltane, a non-profit\norganization filed a petition on behalf of an employee for\nclassification as a special religious worker. The District Office\ndenied the petition, and Soltane appealed to the AAO, which\naffirmed the District Office. Soltane then sought review of the\nAAO decision in district court. We held that, under the APA\nand 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(B)(ii), review of AAO decisions is\nwithin the jurisdiction of the district court so long as those\ndecisions are not committed to agency discretion, and that the\ndetermination of whether Soltane met the specific eligibility\ncriteria set out in the governing statute was not discretionary.\nSoltane, 381 F.3d at 147-48. Since Soltane, the REAL ID Act,\nPub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005), has further\nrestricted the jurisdiction of the district courts to review\ndiscretionary agency actions. Non-discretionary actions,\nhowever, and purely legal determinations made by the agency,\nremain subject to judicial review. See, e.g., Sepulveda v.\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 59, 63 (2d Cir. 2005)\n(“[Section]1252(a)(2)(B) does not bar judicial review of\nnondiscretionary, or purely legal, decisions. . . .”).\n\n        Determination of eligibility for adjustment of status –\nunlike the granting of adjustment itself – is a purely legal\nquestion and does not implicate agency discretion. The\ndetermination at issue here, whether a prior conviction precludes\neligibility for adjustment of status, was also at issue in\nSepulveda. In that case, the Second Circuit held that statutory\nrestrictions on the jurisdiction of district courts to hear\nchallenges to removal orders and other discretionary actions do\nnot affect the district courts’ “jurisdiction to determine whether\n\n                               24\n\f[the statutory provision] is applicable, e.g., whether the\npetitioner is in fact an alien, whether he has in fact been\nconvicted, and whether his offense is one that is within the\nscope of [one of the enumerated sections].” Sepulveda, 407\nF.3d at 63 (citing Santos-Salazar v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 400\nF.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 2005)). The determination at issue here is\nprecisely such a determination: whether under the applicable\nstatutory language as interpreted by the BIA, Pinho was\n“convicted” so as to render him ineligible for adjustment of\nstatus. This is a legal question, not one committed to agency\ndiscretion.\n\n       The agency action at issue here was final and non-\ndiscretionary, it adversely affected Pinho, and it has not been\nmade non-reviewable by statute. Under the APA, therefore,\nPinho is “entitled to judicial review” of the AAO’s decision.13\n\n      Because the District Court had jurisdiction to review the\nAAO decision, we have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28\nU.S.C § 1291. We exercise plenary review of the District\nCourt’s statutory interpretation, but afford deference to a\nreasonable interpretation adopted by the agency. See Acosta v.\nAshcroft, 341 F.3d 218, 222 (3d Cir. 2003). It is the agency’s\nburden, however, to establish the facts supporting\n\n       13\n         Having concluded that jurisdiction exists under the\nAPA, we think it inadvisable to speculate, in the absence of\nbriefing, about alternative jurisdictional avenues by which AAO\ndecisions might be reviewed. We will await cases which in\nwhich the parties contest jurisdiction and put the issue squarely\nbefore us.\n\n                               25\n\finadmissibility “by clear, unequivocal and convincing\nevidence.” See Sandoval v. INS, 240 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir.\n2001).\n\n       The question before us is whether the terms of the order\nvacating Pinho’s 1992 conviction were such as to remove that\nconviction from the scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A), which,\nin conjunction with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A), governs the\nadmissibility of aliens to the United States.\n\n                               III.\n\n                               A.\n\n       When the Immigration and Nationality Act was first\npassed, it lacked a definition of the term “conviction.” The INS\nrelied on state law in determining whether an immigrant was\n“convicted.” See Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 514-15. State\nconvictions that were subsequently vacated were accordingly\nnot treated as “convictions” for immigration purposes. The\nagency was increasingly bedeviled by the diversity of state\nrehabilitative programs and the resulting difficulty in fashioning\na uniform national immigration policy with respect to prior\nconvictions. In In re Ozkok, 19 I. & N. Dec. 546 (B.I.A. 1988),\nthe BIA adopted a three-part definition of “conviction for the\nexpress purpose of evaluating diverse state rehabilitative\nprograms by a common measure.\n\n       When Congress included a definition of “conviction” in\nthe 1996 amendments to the INA, it used, almost verbatim, the\n\n\n\n                               26\n\ffirst two parts of the Ozkok test. The statutory definition\nprovides in its entirety:\n\n       The term “conviction” means, with respect to an\n       alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien\n       entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has\n       been withheld, where –\n\n\n\n       i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the\n       alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo\n       contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to\n       warrant a finding of guilt, and\n\n       ii) the judge has ordered some form of\n       punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s\n       liberty to be imposed.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A).14\n\n      The new definition is disjunctive, encompassing at least\ntwo possible procedural contexts. The first disjunct is “a formal\njudgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.” The meaning\n\n       14\n          See Ozkok, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 551-52. The third part of\nthe test, which was omitted from the statutory definition, dealt\nwith pre-judgment probation, and provided that such probation\nwould be sufficient for a “conviction” if “a judgment of\nconviction or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the person\nviolates the terms of the probation . . .” Id. at 552.\n\n                               27\n\fof this clause is plain enough, echoing as it does the dictionary\ndefinition, see Webster’s Third New International Dictionary at\n499 (“. . . the act of proving, finding, or adjudging a person\nguilty of an offense or crime.”), and thus offers no solution to\nthe problem of withheld judgments. That job is handled by the\nsecond disjunct – those situations in which “adjudication of guilt\nhas been withheld.” “Withhold” means “. . . to desist or refrain\nfrom granting . . . to keep in one’s possession or control.”\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary at 2627. The\ndefinition provides that in situations in which the judge refrains\nfrom granting a judgment of conviction, the defendant will\nnonetheless stand “convicted” for immigration purposes if he\nhas pleaded or been found guilty or admitted sufficient facts to\nsupport a finding of guilt, and the judge has imposed some\npenalty upon him. In our recent decision in Acosta v. Ashcroft,\n341 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2003), we considered whether the\ndefinition covered a defendant who pleaded nolo contendere and\ncompleted a period of probation, and whose indictment was\nsubsequently dismissed. We accepted the BIA’s position, as set\nforth in Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. 512, that the new definition\nrequires treating a person in that situation as “convicted.”\n\n        Section 1101(a)(48)(A), thus, by its terms and by the\nBIA’s interpretation, plainly encompasses at least those\nsituations in which an alien has a judgment of guilt entered by\na court, and those in which the judgment of guilt was never\nentered because it was withheld, but where the alien has pleaded\nor admitted sufficient facts, and some penalty was imposed.\nThere remains the question of how the statute applies to\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\fconvictions that are imposed but subsequently vacated.15 We\nhave not had occasion to review the agency’s interpretation of\n§ 1101(a)(48)(A) with respect to vacated convictions, or with\nrespect to distinctions among vacated convictions.\n\n       Nothing in the statute specifically addresses vacated\nconvictions. Clearly they are not convictions that have been\nwithheld. If they are covered, then, it will be under the first\ndisjunct: “a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a\ncourt.” Undoubtedly a conviction that is later vacated by a court\nmust have been initially entered by a court. The statute is\nentirely silent with respect to the subsequent procedural history\nof a “judgment entered by a court,” and the undoubted\ncongressional purpose of closing the “withheld judgment”\nloophole tells us nothing whatsoever about what Congress’s\npurpose was with respect to vacaturs, or whether it had any\npurpose at all in that regard.16\n\n       15\n          For our purposes here, we will treat the terms “vacated”\nand “expunged,” which appear variously in the BIA opinions, as\nsynonymous. The salient procedural situation is one in which\na conviction is voided or invalidated, “dismiss[ed], cancel[ed]\n. . . discharge[d] or otherwise remove[d],” Sandoval v. I.N.S.,\n240 F.3d 577, 583 (7th Cir. 2001), whatever the label, and\nwhatever the subsequent availability of the record of the\nconviction.\n       16\n        Cf. Acosta, 341 F.3d at 226 n.6 (“[W]e infer a\ncongressional intent not to incorporate . . . a distinction\n[“between rehabilitative statutes that defer[] adjudication and\nthose which expunge[] a prior admission or adjudication of\n\n                               29\n\f        The statutory provision governing inadmissibility, 8\nU.S.C. §1182(a)(2)(A), provides that “any alien convicted of, or\nwho admits committing acts which constitute the essential\nelements of . . . a violation of . . . any law or regulation of a\nState . . . is inadmissible.”17 However broad that language may\nappear, the agencies charged with implementing the statute have\nnever read it to state a blanket deportability rule. The BIA’s\ncurrent interpretation distinguishes between what we may call\n“rehabilitative” vacaturs and “substantive” vacaturs. The\nagency’s position is that\n\n       if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction\n       based on a defect in the underlying criminal\n       proceedings, the respondent no longer has a\n       “conviction” within the meaning of section\n       101(a)(48)(A). If, however, a court vacates a\n       conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of\n       the underlying criminal proceedings, the\n\n\n\nguilt”] into the INA, but we do not infer that the elimination of\nsuch a distinction was the sole purpose of passing the revised\ndefinition of conviction in Section 101(a)(48)(A).”\n       17\n         It is conceivable, of course, that under § 1182(a)(2)(A)\nan immigrant might have admitted committing the relevant acts\neven where the § 1101(a)(48)(A) definition of “conviction” does\nnot encompass the circumstances of his conviction. We need\nnot decide this question here, because in this case, the admission\nand the guilty plea are one and the same. Had he been admitted\nto the PTI program, he need not have admitted anything.\n\n                               30\n\f       respondent remains “convicted” for immigration\n       purposes.\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.\n\n       The BIA, in the cases leading up to Pickering, was faced\nwith applying the new definition to three distinct sets of\ncircumstances. The easy cases are those like Roldan, in which\nthe judgment of guilt is never entered, but is withheld pending\ncompletion of a rehabilitative program. These cases are\nstraightforwardly covered by the statutory definition, and\nRoldan breaks no new ground. The second category are cases\nin which a judgment is entered, but later vacated explicitly in\norder to prevent deportation or other federal immigration\nconsequences. Pickering considered this type of case, and held\nthe conviction to remain in force under the definition. The third\ncategory are cases in which a judgment is entered, but later\nvacated because of substantive defects in the initial proceeding.\nRodriguez-Ruiz was such a case, and the BIA held the\nconviction not to fall within the scope of the definition.\n\n        The BIA, in short, interprets §§ 1148 and 1182 to create\na distinction between vacated convictions based on the reasons\nfor the vacatur. We have not yet decided whether the distinction\ndrawn by the agency between rehabilitative and substantive\nvacaturs is a reasonable one in light of the statutory language,18\n\n       18\n         Our decision in Acosta pertains only to deferred\njudgments; as we noted, the “charges against [Acosta] were\nultimately dismissed without any adjudication of guilt.” 341\nF.3d at 221.\n\n                               31\n\fnor have we decided – as we must in this case – how we, and the\nagency, are to tell the difference.\n\n                                 B.\n\n        We will not disturb an agency’s settled, authoritative\ninterpretation of a statute it is charged with implementing unless\nthat interpretation is plainly unreasonable in light of the plain\nlanguage of the statute taken as a whole. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.\nv. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984);\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229-32 (2001). The\nmost comprehensive explanation of the agency’s interpretation\nis found in Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 515-20. Relying on the\njoint conference report, the BIA noted the “Congressional intent\nthat even in cases where adjudication is ‘deferred,’ the original\nfinding or confession of guilt is sufficient to establish a\n‘conviction’ for purposes of the immigration laws.” Roldan, 22\nI. & N. Dec. at 518 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, at\n224 (1996)). The BIA then analogized from deferred\nadjudications to vacated convictions, and discerned a “clear\nindication that Congress intends that the determination of\nwhether an alien is convicted for immigration purposes be fixed\nat the time of the original determination of guilt, coupled with\nthe imposition of some punishment.” Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec.\nat 521. The statute, of course, says nothing about vacated\nconvictions. Still less does the statute, or the legislative history,\naddress the distinction between rehabilitative and substantive\nvacaturs. Nor, finally, was the question of vacated convictions\nproperly before the BIA in Roldan: Roldan’s judgment was\ndeferred, not vacated. Nonetheless, the BIA opined that “it\nsimply would defy logic for us, in a case concerning a\n\n                                 32\n\fconviction in a state which effects rehabilitation through the\ntechnical erasure of the record of conviction, to provide greater\ndeference to that state’s determination that a conviction no\nlonger exists [than to a state which “never considered him\nconvicted”].” Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 521. By this\ninference, the BIA corralled within § 1101(a)(48)(A) all post-\nconviction expungement procedures that are analogous to\nwithholding judgment.19 This analogy paves the road from\nRoldan to Pickering. We find the BIA’s logic not unreasonable:\nto parse the difference between those past determinations of\nguilt declared “no longer to exist” and those declared “never to\n\n\n\n\n       19\n        Some commentators have pointed out that state-deferred\nadjudications and state expungement statutes “are like apples\nand oranges,” because while an expungement is a state’s final\ndetermination of a person’s legal status, “[d]eferring\nadjudication of guilt . . . simply represents an initial step that\nmay [or may not] lead to formal expungement.” James A. R.\nNafziger & Michael Yimesgen, The Effect of Expungement on\nRemovability of Non-Citizens, 36 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 915, 930\n(2003). It is certainly true that deferred judgments and\nexpungements are different, and it may well be that a sound\nimmigration policy would take that difference into account, but\nwe do not sit in judgment of the soundness of immigration\npolicy: the question before us is simply whether the language\nof § 1101(a)(48)(A) may reasonably be read by the agency as\nencompassing both.\n\n                               33\n\fhave existed” is to follow the rabbit into a metaphysical hole\nwhere courts rightly fear to tread.20\n\n      Roldan’s holding is expressly limited to convictions\nvacated under “rehabilitative procedure[s]”; the BIA\nemphasized that its decision\n\n       does not address the situation where the alien has\n       had his or her conviction vacated by a state court\n       on direct appeal, wherein the court determines\n       that vacation of the conviction is warranted on the\n       merits, or on grounds relating to a violation of a\n       fundamental statutory or constitutional right in the\n       underlying criminal proceedings.\n\nRoldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 523. In Rodriguez-Ruiz, the BIA\ntakes it as given that such a vacated conviction would not be a\nconviction under § 1101(a)(48)(A). There was little need to\nexplain that assumption, because the INS did not argue\notherwise, contending only that the vacatur at issue was not\n“warranted on the merits.”\n\n\n       20\n          This is the jurisprudential cousin of the “grandfather”\ntime-travel hypothetical: would it be possible to go back in time\nand murder one’s own grandfather? Does a court – even one of\ngeneral jurisdiction – have the power to declare that an earlier\nevent never happened? See, e.g., Hon. Leon R. Yankwich, The\nFederal Penal System, 10 F.R.D. 539, 555 (1950) (suggesting\nthat following expungement, a person can “claim truthfully that\nhe has never been convicted of a felony”).\n\n                               34\n\f        The distinction between substantive and rehabilitative\nvacaturs is rooted in the history of immigration enforcement.\nThat history is relevant both to our review of the reasonableness\nof the agency interpretation of the statute, because the statutory\nlanguage was adopted against the background of consistent\nagency practice with respect to vacated convictions. The BIA\nheld as early as 1943 that an expunged conviction was not a\n“conviction” for immigration purposes, and adhered to that\nposition with only occasional exceptions until Roldan. See In re\nV–, No. 56033/701 (B.I.A. 1943); In re D–, 7 I. & N. Dec. 670,\n674 (1958) (where a conviction has been expunged, “there has,\nas a matter of law, been no conviction for immigration\npurposes”); In re G–, 9 I. & N. Dec. 159, 169 (B.I.A. 1960)\n(Attorney General’s opinion) (“Pino v. Landon [349 U.S. 1\n(1959) (per curiam reversal of First Circuit determination that a\nvacated state conviction was a conviction for immigration\npurposes)] would seem, therefore, to make it an a fortiori\nconclusion in a nonnarcotics case that an expungement of an\nalien’s conviction under section 1203.4 of the California Penal\nCode withdraws the support of that conviction from a\ndeportation order under section 241(a)(4) and brings it to the\nground.”).\n\n       The BIA, on the advice of the Attorney General, made an\nexception for vacated drug offenses21 in 1959, see In re A F, 8\n\n       21\n         Lest the significance of this exception be overestimated,\nwe note that although Pinho’s offense was a drug offense, the\nabove-noted exception referred only to rehabilitative vacaturs.\nPinho’s claim, by contrast, is that his was not a rehabilitative\nvacatur.\n\n                               35\n\fI. & N. Dec. 429 (B.I.A. 1959), and was shortly thereafter urged\nto extend that exception to other types of crimes. It declined to\ndo so on several grounds, notably because “[t]he contrary rule\nhas been in effect since at least 1943 [and t]here has been no\nCongressional criticism of this rule.” In re G–, 9 I. & N. Dec.\n159, 163 (B.I.A. 1960). The BIA reiterated the rule – that with\nthe exception of drug convictions, expunged convictions are not\n“convictions” – right up to the passage of the 1996 IIRIRA\namendments. In 1996, the Board held:\n\n       We agree with the respondent that if his\n       conviction has been expunged . . . he is no longer\n       deportable. . . . For many years this Board has\n       recognized that a criminal conviction that has\n       been expunged . . . may not support an order of\n       deportation. . . . However, an exception to this\n       rule exists for expunged drug convictions. . . .\n       Congress did not intend for aliens convicted of\n       drug offenses to escape deportation on the basis\n       of a state procedure authorizing a technical\n       erasure of the conviction. [Drug crimes are] an\n       exception to the line of cases by this Board ruling\n       that a conviction which has been expunged . . .\n       could not be made the basis for deportation\n       proceedings. . . . However, the Attorney General\n       specifically limited this exception to drug\n       offenses. . . . [That exception] should not be\n       extended beyond drug cases.\n\nIn re Fructoso Luviano-Rodriguez, 21 I. & N. Dec. 235, 237-\n238 (B.I.A. 1996).\n\n                               36\n\f        After the introduction of the new statutory definition of\n“conviction” in the 1996 amendments, the BIA shifted course in\nRoldan, analogizing, as described above, rehabilitative vacaturs\nto withheld judgments. Certainly the statutory language as\nenacted closes any definitional loophole through which withheld\njudgments might escape the “conviction” label. But the BIA’s\nanalogy to the “withheld judgment” prong of the statutory\ndefinition pulls with it only rehabilitative vacaturs. The\n“hallowed principle of precedent . . . going back over fifty\nyears,” James A. R. Nafziger & Michael Yimesgen, The Effect\nof Expungement on Removability of Non-Citizens, 36 U. Mich.\nJ.L. Reform 915, 930 (2003) – that is, the government’s long\nhistory of treating vacated convictions as nullities for\nimmigration purposes – was preserved for those vacaturs that\nwere not the functional equivalent of rehabilitative withheld\njudgments – those vacaturs, in other words, that were based on\nunderlying defects in the conviction itself.\n\n       The BIA has not explained precisely why it thinks\nsubstantive vacaturs do not fit the §1101(a)(48)(A) definition.\nThe foregoing account, however, is sufficient to support our\ndetermination that the distinction is reasonable.22 Given its\n\n       22\n         We do not, accordingly, read the statute as requiring\nunambiguously that all convictions, even those vacated because\nof substantive defects, are included in the definition. In this we\njoin the published opinions of at least the First, Second, and\nSeventh Circuits, and depart from the Fifth Circuit. See\nHerrera-Inirio v. I.N.S., 208 F.3d 299, 305 (1st Cir. 2000);\nUnited States v. Campbell, 167 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir. 1999);\nSandoval v. I.N.S., 240 F.3d 577, 583-84 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\n                               37\n\fRenteria-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., 322 F.3d 804, 817-22 (5th Cir.\n2002). In Renteria-Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit, in holding that\na guilty plea followed by a Judicial Recommendation Against\nDeportation (“JRAD”) remains a conviction for immigration\npurposes, observed that “five circuits, including this court, have\nconcluded that a vacated or otherwise expunged state conviction\nremains valid under § 1101(a)(48)(A),” 322 F.3d at 814, which\nis true enough if we interpret “a” to mean “some” rather than\n“all” (that is, “a vacated conviction may remain valid” as\nopposed to “a vacated conviction must remain valid”). The use\nof the ambiguous phrasing is misleading in this context, because\nthe other circuits listed, and now this Court, accept the\ndistinction made by the BIA between convictions which do\nremain valid and convictions which do not. Indeed, in Renteria-\nGonzalez, Judge Benavides concurred specially to emphasize\nthat “the majority opinion paints with too broad a brush . . .\n[because] none of the convictions in the five cases cited by the\nmajority was vacated based on the merits of the underlying\ncriminal proceeding, i.e., a violation of a statutory or\nconstitutional right with respect to the criminal conviction.” 322\nF. 3d at 820. Because Renteria-Gonzalez’s conviction was\nlikewise not vacated because of a substantive defect, Judge\nBenavides continues, “any indication in the majority opinion\nthat a conviction vacated based on the merits constitutes a\nconviction under § 1101(a)(48)(A) is entirely dicta. . . .” Id. at\n823 n.24.\n        The breadth of Renteria-Gonzalez’s holding remains\nunclear. Soon after the decision was issued, an immigration\njudge cited Renteria-Gonzalez in holding that a conviction that\nhad been vacated due to “procedural and substantive flaws in the\n\n                               38\n\funderlying proceeding” remained valid under § 1101(a)(48)(A),\nand the Fifth Circuit, per Judge Benavides, “reluctantly”\ndismissed the petition for review, holding that, although the\ncircuit was now “out of step with the rest of the nation,” it was\nbound by Renteria-Gonzalez. Discipio v. Ashcroft, 369 F.3d\n472, 474-75 (2004). However, the Justice Department\nsubsequently petitioned the court to vacate Discipio and remand\nthe case to the BIA for dismissal. The Justice Department\nargued that because § 1101(a)(48)(A) “is silent on the effect of\na vacated conviction on an alien’s immigration status, [the Fifth\nCircuit] should defer to the Board’s” interpretation as set forth\nin Pickering, that substantive vacaturs are not “convictions.”\nDiscipio v. Ashcroft, 417 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2005). The panel\nagreed to remand the case, and rehearing en banc was denied as\nmoot, Id. at 450, leaving the precise holding of Renteria-\nGonzalez up in the air. At the very least, it is clear that to read\nRenteria-Gonzalez to cover susbstantive vacaturs is to stretch it\nfar beyond its facts.\n        Accepting the distinction between substantive and\nrehabilitative vacaturs not only gives proper deference to the\nagency’s interpretation, but also serves to avoid the\nconstitutional problems that might arise under a reading which\nbrings constitutionally protected conduct or constitutionally\ninfirm proceedings into the category of “conviction” – cases, for\nexample, involving an alien who was convicted of conduct\nsubsequently deemed constitutionally protected, or whose\nconviction was reversed on direct appeal because of insufficient\nevidence, or whose conviction was vacated on collateral attack\nbecause of a plain constitutional defect. The agency does not\nread the statute as encompassing such situations, however, so\n\n                                39\n\flongstanding, consistent practice, the agency may reasonably\nread the statutory language analyzed above to authorize its\ndrawing this distinction among vacated convictions. We\ntherefore begin our analysis with the proposition that an alien\nwhose conviction is vacated on collateral attack because the\nalien’s trial counsel was ineffective under the Sixth Amendment,\nno longer stands “convicted” for immigration purposes. The\nquestion is whether Pinho’s is such a case, and, more\nimportantly, how that determination is to be made.\n\n                               C.\n\n       We are thus faced with the question of just what the BIA\nmeans by “based on” and “for reasons.” It is easy enough to\ndetermine what a vacatur order is “based on” when the court\nissuing the order holds a hearing and then issues a written\ndecision, complete with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nBut not all orders come with such clear explanations. Such was\nthe order in the case at bar. Pinho filed a motion for post-\nconviction relief, and raised ineffective assistance as his only\nground. The prosecution did not answer that motion. At the\nhearing on the motion, the parties agreed that Pinho’s conviction\nwould be vacated, he would be placed in the PTI program, and\nthe charges would be dismissed. The one-sentence order of\ndismissal simply cites the PTI placement.\n\n      Facially, then, one might say that the conviction was\nvacated “based on” the parties’ agreement to Pinho’s PTI\nplacement. After all, the words of the judge at the hearing were:\n\n\nthese difficult cases have not come before us.\n\n                               40\n\f“[S]ince Mr. Pinho has been accepted into PTI, I think the\nprevious judgment of conviction can be vacated.” Acceptance\ninto PTI is, likewise, on its face a “reason[] unrelated to the\nmerits of the underlying criminal proceedings.”\n\n        But our inquiry cannot end there. The fact that the\nparties agreed to settle rather than proceed to trial on the\nineffective assistance claim should not be dispositive. Indeed,\nit may be that the likelihood that the prosecution will agree to a\nsettlement such as PTI placement will increase proportionally\nwith the strength of the alien’s constitutional claim. If the BIA\nin Pickering had meant to require an adjudication of the merits\nof aliens’ claims of substantive defects in the original conviction\nin order to make out an adequate “basis,” it could have said so.\nBut it did not. It has instead drawn its line between vacaturs\n“based on” underlying defects and vacaturs granted “for\nreasons” not related to underlying defects, and it is readily\napparent that the set of vacaturs “based on” underlying defects\nis not necessarily coextensive with the set of vacaturs based on\nadjudications of underlying defects. We must therefore inquire\nas to the reasons underlying the vacatur order, and it would\nobviously be begging the question simply to invoke the PTI\nacceptance yet again. The prosecutor’s offer of PTI placement\ndid not spring into being ex nihilo; rather, it was by way of\nsettlement of Pinho’s collateral attack on the constitutional\nvalidity of his conviction. The relevant “reason,” then, for our\nPickering analysis, is plainly the reason for the settlement\nagreement.\n\n       That agreement, as the judge states at the March 10\ncolloquy, was the “upshot” of negotiations between the\n\n                                41\n\fattorneys, who “have been dealing with this matter for several\nmonths.” The “matter” the attorneys had been “dealing with”\nwas Pinho’s motion for post-conviction relief based on\nineffective assistance of counsel. Of signal importance to this\ncase is the fact that that motion was the only pleading before the\njudge. The state did not answer the motion. At no time did\nPinho, or the state, or the judge, raise any issue other than\nineffective assistance. The government asks us to hold that the\nvacatur order was not “based on” the ineffective assistance\nmotion, even though there was no other basis for vacatur offered\nat any point in the proceedings. The government asks us, in\nother words, to hold that the agency may permissibly find a\nmotive in a state-court ruling that is nowhere stated in the\nrecord. This we decline to do.\n\n        At oral argument the government contended that the\nmotives of state prosecutors and judges might change over time\nand might not be reflected in the record. Perhaps a new\nprosecutor, reviewing old cases, might decide that some of his\npredecessor’s policies had been unduly harsh. Perhaps such a\nprosecutor, when presented with a post-conviction relief claim\nbrought by a defendant who had been denied entry into a pre-\ntrial diversion program years earlier because of a now-\ndiscredited policy, might decide to “do the right thing,” and help\nthat defendant avoid the immigration consequences of his guilty\nplea. Perhaps a state judge, looking at the case, would see a\nhard-working family man threatened with deportation based on\na relatively minor crime committed a decade earlier, and decide\nto help that hard-working family man get around the federal\nimmigration laws. Perhaps, perhaps. We present this\nhypothetical to highlight the fact that it is precisely that: a\n\n                               42\n\fhypothetical proposed by the government about possible\nmotives of state actors nowhere found in the record. Were we\nto allow the Department of Homeland Security to base its legal\ndeterminations of immigrants’ statutory eligibility for\nadjustment of status upon hypothetical scenarios such as this, we\nwould be opening the door to – indeed in many cases due\nprocess would require – a flood of subpoenas to judges and\nprosecutors of sovereign states ordering them to appear in\nfederal immigration proceedings to answer questions about\nmotives, feelings, and sympathies that appear nowhere in any\nwritten record, but that may have prompted their official actions.\nBehind the expansive interpretation of “reason” and “basis”\nurged by the government, we see the specter of such unseemly\ninquisitions.\n\n        How else, indeed, could Pinho have challenged the\nagency’s claim that the vacatur order was not “really” based on\nhis ineffective assistance claim? Would he not have to call the\nprosecutor and ask him why, exactly, he agreed to PTI\nplacement? Would he not have to call the judge and ask him\nwhy, exactly, he agreed to vacate the conviction and dismiss the\ncharges? And if the answers were unfavorable to the\ngovernment’s theory, would it not seek, in cross-examination,\nto establish that the state actors harbored secret motives, such as\nundue sympathy for an immigrant or animosity toward federal\nimmigration law?\n\n       We cannot endorse a test which requires speculation\nabout, or scrutiny of, the reasons for judges’ actions other than\n\n\n\n\n                                43\n\fthose reasons that appear on the record.23 Whether or not\nconstitutional avoidance requires this result,24 avoidance of\nabsurdities surely does. See Sheridan v. United States, 487 U.S.\n392, 492 (1988) (“[C]ourts should strive to avoid attributing\nabsurd designs to Congress. . . .”). But most important are basic\nconsiderations of comity. When, as in this case, there arises a\ndispute over the “reason” or “basis” for a decision, if the parties\nare permitted to speculate about unstated motives that perhaps\nunderlie vacatur orders, there will be little alternative to calling\njudges and prosecutors as witnesses in immigration proceedings.\n\n       23\n         Cf. Sandoval, 240 F.3d at 583 (“The INS also alleges\nthat the modification [of Sandoval’s conviction] was entered\nsolely for immigration purposes, and is thus ineffective. This\nallegation is unfounded. The judge’s modification was in\nresponse to Sandoval’s properly filed motion stating a\ncognizable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. That\nSandoval may have filed his motion in response to the threat of\ndeportation is irrelevant. Further, even if the state court judge’s\ndecision to modify Sandoval’s sentence was motivated by the\nconsequences of the federal immigration law, that fact would\nnot render the modification ineffective for immigration\npurposes.”).\n       24\n         For example, both judges and prosecutors enjoy\nabsolute immunity from damage suits and criminal prosecution\narising from their official acts. See Stump v. Sparkman, 435\nU.S. 349 (1978); Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976). It\nis unclear how the principle of immunity might extend to\nsubpoenaed testimony about unstated motives. Our decision\ntoday avoids this issue.\n\n                                44\n\fWe do not deem such a prospect to be in keeping with\nlongstanding principles of federal respect for state decisions as\nto the meaning of state law. “[T]he respect that federal courts\nowe the States and the States’ procedural rules,” Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U.S. 722, 726 (1991), is owed no less by federal\nagencies than by federal courts. The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly emphasized that state courts are the ultimate\nauthorities on the meaning of state law. Other than “a few\nexceptional cases in which the Constitution imposes a duty or\nconfers a power on a particular branch of a State’s government,”\nBush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 112 (2000), the authority of state\ncourts to determine state-law questions is clear: “[C]omity and\nrespect for federalism compel us to defer to the decisions of\nstate courts on issues of state law. That practice reflects our\nunderstanding that the decisions of state courts are definitive\npronouncements of the will of the States as sovereigns.” Id.\nRecognizing the force of this longstanding principle, the BIA\ncorrectly declined the government’s invitation in Rodriguez-\nRuiz to “look behind” a state-court ruling and decide whether\nthat ruling was correct under state law.25            The same\nconsiderations govern the search for unstated motives: both\ncontravene long-settled principles of federalism. A state law\nmay be declared unconstitutional; it may not, however, simply\nbe rewritten. So too, we hold, with vacatur orders.\n\n       The government could have avoided this problem\naltogether. As the Supreme Court has emphasized, the\n\n       25\n         We thus decline the government’s similar invitation\nhere to decide the ineffective assistance claim ourselves. See\nBrief for Appellee, at 11-12.\n\n                               45\n\fdefinition of “conviction” for purposes of applying federal laws\nis a question of federal law. Dickerson v. New Banner Institute,\nInc., 460 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1983) (“[W]hether one has been\n‘convicted’ within the language of [federal] statutes is\nnecessarily . . . a question of federal, not state, law, despite the\nfact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by\nthe law of the State.”). Further, the executive branch is entitled\nto great deference in formulating immigration policy, an\n“especially sensitive political function[] that implicate[s]\nquestions of foreign relations,” I.N.S. v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110\n(1988).      Given the expansive statutory definition of\n“conviction,” and the deference the agency’s interpretation is\nowed, the agency could have chosen to contend that as a matter\nof federal law all vacated state convictions remain “convictions”\nunder § 1101(a)(48)(A), whether rehabilitative or substantive.\nIf the agency wishes to adopt this interpretation of the statutory\ndefinition it may do so, through rulemaking or adjudication, and\nit may defend that interpretation before the courts. But the\nagency has not done so, and it is another matter entirely for the\nagency to distinguish among vacated convictions based on the\nreasons for the vacatur, and then to arrogate to itself the power\nto find hidden reasons lurking beneath the surface of the rulings\nof state courts. Under the Supremacy Clause, the Department of\nHomeland Security may, pursuant to statutory authority,\nproperly interpret § 1101 (a)(48)(A) to encompass convictions\nvacated by order of state courts. But it is far from clear that it\nmay rewrite state-court rulings as to the legal basis for those\norders. Our Federalism has not yet come to that.\n\n                                D.\n\n\n\n                                46\n\f        In this case, the District Court openly expressed its\nsuspicion that Pinho’s ineffective assistance motion was, sub\nsilentio, something else entirely. “It is troubling that [Pinho]\nadmitted guilt, served his sentence and then waited\napproximately three years to seek post-conviction relief based\non ineffective assistance. . . .” Pinho v. Ashcroft, No. 03cv6232,\nat 10 (D.N.J. Aug. 9, 2004). The District Court then turned for\nguidance to an unpublished district court opinion, Lim v.\nAshcroft,26 involving similar issues, noting that “Chief Judge\nBissell shared the same concerns of this Court,” namely “that\nthere was no reason for the state to entertain petitioner’s post-\nconviction motion for any purpose other than to benefit\npetitioner before the INS or this Court. . . .” Id. at 11. The\nDistrict Court then stated explicitly that “Chief Judge Bissell’s\nopinion in Lim . . . is a factor in denying Plaintiff’s motion.” Id.\nThe District Court’s quasi-adoption of Lim is noteworthy for\nmore than its procedural irregularity. In Lim the district court\naccused the state judge and prosecutor of being practitioners, or\nwilling victims, of outright duplicity. A brief discussion of Lim\nis therefore warranted here, because it is an object lesson in the\npitfalls of the government’s proposed approach.\n\n        Lim pled guilty in New Jersey in 1996 to kidnapping; in\n1998, the INS began removal proceedings. In 2001, Lim sought\npostconviction relief in state court, contending that he had\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel, and petitioned the\ndistrict court to stay deportation pending exhaustion of the state\n\n       26\n         Lim v. Ashcroft, No. 01-CV-3271, 2002 WL 1967945\n(D.N.J. 2002) (unpublished). We remind the District Court that\nunpublished district court opinions are not a source of law.\n\n                                47\n\fclaim. After the state court granted Lim post-conviction relief,\nthe district court took it upon itself to review the state court’s\nstate-law ruling,27 and declared the entire proceeding to be a\n\n       27\n         The court summarized the proceedings as follows:\n\n       [T]he transcript shows that at the outset the court\n       was presented with an arrangement in the nature\n       of a plea agreement, that had been reached prior\n       to the hearing between Mr. Lim and state\n       authorities. Pursuant to the arrangement, the\n       following actions were taken at the hearing:\n       (1) the state court permitted Mr. Lim to withdraw\n       his earlier plea to the kidnapping charge and enter\n       a plea of guilty to a charge in the original\n       indictment of aggravated assault; (2) the court\n       vacated the kidnapping conviction and stated that\n       the date of the new plea should be treated for\n       immigration purposes as having been entered on\n       March 18, 1996 (a fictitious date as far as the\n       record reveals); (3) the state dismissed voluntarily\n       the remaining charges; (4) the court sentenced\n       Mr. Lim to time served. All agreed that the\n       foregoing arrangement’s purpose was to facilitate\n       Mr. Lim in avoiding deportation; by attempting to\n       amend the date of conviction, Mr. Lim and his\n       counsel sought to avoid the AEDPA amendment\n       and preserve his eligibility for Section 212(c)\n       consideration.\n\nLim, 2002 WL 1967945, at *3.\n\n                               48\n\fsham: “[T]his Court determines that there was a significantly\ndeficient legal foundation for the state court’s vacation of Mr.\nLim’s kidnapping conviction.” Lim, No. 01-CV-3271, at *5.\nRegardless of what the state court said it found, according to the\ndistrict court, it did not “really” find ineffective assistance. The\nDistrict Court concluded that a hidden motive was at work:\n\n       [I]n accommodating the proposed plea\n       arrangement, the state court acted not on the basis\n       of a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance of\n       counsel, but for some other reason. . . . The [state\n       court’s own] remarks unmistakably show that the\n       state court vacated the kidnapping conviction out\n       of concern for Mr. Lim’s immigration plight, not\n       because there was any merit in his collateral\n       attack on the kidnapping charge.\n\nId. at *9. The prosecutor and the judge were, according to the\ndistrict court, played for fools; they were made the dupes of a\nconniving lawyer who “played to the[ir] interests” in\n“contriv[ing] a fictional disposition . . . as a means to subvert\nfederal statutes.” Id. at *10. The post-conviction relief petition\nwas thus a fraud: “[I]t is apparent that the petition for post-\nconviction relief that was pursued in this case was not used to\ntest the merit of Mr. Lim’s claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, but rather as a vehicle to engineer a result that would\nbenefit petitioner in proceedings before the INS or this\nCourt. . . .” Id. at *9.\n\n      The concern, then, that the District Court in this case\n“shared” with the court in Lim is that the integrity of legal\n\n                                49\n\fproceedings in state courts cannot be trusted. This Court does\nnot approve of accusations of dishonesty or complicity in\n“subversion” leveled at state courts and prosecutors. We will\nnot accept an interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality\nAct that permits, let alone requires, speculation by federal\nagencies about the secret motives of state judges and\nprosecutors.\n\n        The temptation to second-guess the motives of state\nofficials is a predictable byproduct of inadequate judicial\nguidance as to the permissible bounds of agency inquiry into the\nbasis for state-court actions. The powers of immigration\nofficials are extensive, and if immigrants are to have any\ncertainty as to the effect criminal proceedings in state courts\nmay have on their immigration status, those bounds must be\ndrawn plainly and brightly. Where definitions are broad, so\nmust they be clear. It cannot be the case that whether a\nconviction is a conviction depends on whether an immigration\nofficial suspects a state judge of secretly harboring subversive\nmotives. If the relationship between state criminal proceedings\nand federal immigration proceedings is to be governed by the\nrule of law, then that law must be a law of rules.\n\n        We therefore announce the following categorical test for\nclassification of vacated convictions under the INA.28 To\ndetermine the basis for a vacatur order, the agency must look\n\n       28\n         Although Judge McKee agrees with the rationale and\nresult of our decision, he does not agree that we need to\nestablish a formal test to properly resolve this appeal. He\ntherefore does not endorse the majority’s categorical test.\n\n                              50\n\ffirst to the order itself. If the order explains the court’s reasons\nfor vacating the conviction, the agency’s inquiry must end there.\nIf the order does not give a clear statement of reasons, the\nagency may look to the record before the court when the order\nwas issued. No other evidence of reasons may be considered.29\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           Our test is informed by our decisions in United States\nv. Taylor, 98 F.3d 768 (3d Cir. 1996), and United States v.\nJoshua, 976 F.2d 844 (3d Cir. 1992). In those cases we had to\ndetermine how to classify a prior crime for purposes of the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines. We held that “a sentencing\ncourt should look solely to the conduct alleged in the count of\nthe indictment charging the offense of conviction. . . .” Taylor,\n98 F.3d at 771 (quoting Joshua, 976 F.2d at 856). Thus, to\ndetermine whether a prior crime was a “crime of violence,” the\nsentencing court could look only at the conduct alleged in the\nindictment for the count which was proved or admitted. The\ncourt could not look outside the indictment to determine whether\nthe defendant actually committed other acts which did not\nappear in the indictment on that count.\n         Our test also accords deference to the BIA’s formulation\nin Pickering, which provides that “in making this determination\n[of the basis for a vacatur] we look to the law under which the\n. . . court issued its order and the terms of the order itself, as well\nas the reasons presented by the respondent in requesting that the\ncourt vacate the conviction.” Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 625.\n\n                                  51\n\f                               IV.\n\n       Applying this rule to the case at hand is straightforward.\nIn his pleading, Pinho raised only one claim: ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The state did not file an answer. The\njudge’s vacatur order refers to the PTI placement agreement,\nwhich was reached in settlement of Pinho’s ineffective\nassistance claim. The only basis for the vacatur appearing in the\norder or the pleadings is Pinho’s ineffective assistance claim.\nUnder the distinction articulated in Pickering, therefore, Pinho’s\nconviction was vacated “based on a defect in the underlying\ncriminal proceedings,” and Pinho accordingly “no longer has a\n‘conviction’ within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A).”\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.\n\n       The AAO therefore erred as a matter of law in\ndetermining Pinho to be ineligible for adjustment of status under\n§§ 1101 and 1182, and the District Court erred in affirming that\ndetermination. We wish to emphasize that while we may, and\nmust, ensure that purely legal determinations are made by the\nagency in accordance with law, the decision whether in fact to\ngrant adjustment of status is a matter entrusted to the discretion\nof the agency, and we lack the power to review denials of\nadjustment applications as such. When we have instructed the\nagency on the correct legal standard, we have said all that we\nmay say. We will accordingly reverse the judgment below and\nremand to the District Court for the granting of relief consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               52\n\f",

We conclude that the government may reasonably\ndraw a distinction between convictions vacated for rehabilitative\npurposes and those vacated because of underlying defects in the\ncriminal proceedings, and we establish a categorical test to\nguide this determination. Applying this test, we will reverse the\njudgment of the District Court.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n       Petitioner Gummersindo Pinho, a native of Portugal, is\nmarried to a United States citizen with whom he has two\nchildren, who are also U.S. citizens. In February 1992, Pinho\nwas arrested and charged with three third-degree drug offenses\nunder New Jersey law: possession of cocaine (“Count I”),\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine (“Count II”), and\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine on or near school\nproperty (“Count III”). Because he had no prior criminal record,\nPinho applied for admission into New Jersey’s “Pre-Trial\nIntervention” program (“PTI”), under which criminal\nproceedings would be postponed pending Pinho’s completion of\na rehabilitation program, at which point the charges would be\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fdropped. Admission into PTI did not require an admission of\nguilt.1\n\n      1\n       The PTI program worked in 1992 just as it does today:\nonce a defendant is accepted, the judge postpones all\nproceedings against him for at most thirty-six months, after\nwhich the judge must either dismiss the indictment, postpone\nproceedings further, or restore proceedings. With respect to\ndismissal, the relevant rule provides:\n\n      On the recommendation of the program director\n      and with the consent of the prosecutor and the\n      defendant, [“the designated judge shall”] dismiss\n      the complaint, indictment or accusation against\n      the defendant, such a dismissal to be designated\n      ‘matter adjusted - complaint (or indictment or\n      accusation) dismissed.’\n\nN.J. Rules Governing Criminal Practice, Rule 3-28 (1992\nversion).\n\n       The New Jersey Supreme Court has issued guidelines for\noperation of PTI. Guideline 4 provides: “Enrollment in PTI\nprograms should be conditioned upon neither informal\nadmission nor entry of a plea of guilty. Enrollment of\ndefendants who maintain their innocence should be permitted\nunless the defendant’s attitude would render pre-trial\nintervention ineffective.”   The accompanying comment\nprovided:\n\n      A PTI program is presented to defendants as an\n\n                             4\n\f       Pinho’s application to PTI was rejected, however. At the\ntime, the local state prosecutor’s office, acting in accordance\nwith a directive of the state Attorney General, had a per se rule\nagainst accepting into PTI any defendant against whom there\nwas a viable case for possession with intent to distribute drugs\nat or near a school. See State v. Caliguri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192714\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192714/state-v-caliguiri/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 921\n(N.J. 1999). This rule was later invalidated by the New Jersey\nSupreme Court as contravening the purposes of the statute\ngoverning PTI. Id. Under the New Jersey Rules, appeal of\ndenials of PTI applications was permitted only following a\nconviction or guilty plea. N.J. Rules Governing Criminal\nPractice Rule 3.28(f), (g) (1992 version).\n\n       On August 17, 1992, Pinho pleaded guilty to Count I,\npossession of cocaine. He was represented at the time of the\nplea by the same attorney who helped him apply to PTI. Counts\nII and III were dismissed. Pinho’s sentence was two years’\n\n\n       opportunity to earn a dismissal of charges for\n       social reasons and reasons of present and future\n       behavior, legal guilt or innocence\n       notwithstanding. . . . Within the context of\n       pretrial intervention, when and whether guilt\n       should be admitted is a decision for\n       counselors. . . . Neither admission of guilt nor\n       acknowledgment or responsibility is required.\n       Steps to bar participation solely on such grounds\n       would be an unwarranted discrimination.\n\nN.J. Rules Governing Criminal Practice, Rule 3-28, Guideline\n4, Comment (1992 version).\n\n                               5\n\fprobation, a substance abuse evaluation, an assessment of\n$1,080, and the loss of his driving privileges for six months.\n\n        On June 2, 1997, some five years later, and after he had\nserved his sentence, Pinho, now represented by different\ncounsel, applied for post-conviction relief in New Jersey\nSuperior Court, contending that he had received ineffective\nassistance of counsel in connection with his rejection from PTI.\nThe motion was timely, see N.J. Court Rule 3.22-12(a)\n(providing that motions for post-conviction relief are timely\nwithin five years). In the motion, Pinho alleged that his prior\ncounsel had failed to ascertain whether the conduct underlying\nCount III had actually occurred near a school. It is undisputed\nthat while the building had previously been a school, it was, at\nthe time of the alleged crime, in fact not a school, but rather a\nmaintenance and storage building. Pinho contended that, had\nthis fact been known, he would not have been deemed ineligible\nfor PTI through the operation of the per se rule.2 New Jersey\ncourts have held that counsel’s failure to establish PTI eligibility\ncan support ineffective assistance claims. See State v. Marrero,\n\n\n       2\n        Eligibility, of course, does not guarantee acceptance,\nwhich remained in the prosecutor’s discretion. Because of the\noperation of the rule, though, Pinho was never even considered.\nSo while he might eventually have been rejected even with\neffective assistance of counsel, he would not have been rejected\nbecause of the rule. In this respect, Pinho’s 1992 PTI\napplication mirrors his 2000 adjustment of status application. In\neach case a non-discretionary eligibility determination served as\nthe gatekeeper for a discretionary action.\n\n                                 6\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2389159\"><a href=\"/opinion/2389159/state-v-marrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1978); State v. Cruz,\nNo. A-5184-02T5 (N.J. Super. Ct. 2004) (unpublished).\n\n       The state did not file an answer to Pinho’s motion, and\nthe court held a hearing on his claim on March 10, 1998. At that\nhearing, the court observed:\n\n       [The parties] have been dealing with this matter\n       for several months, the upshot of which was that\n       there would be an application by Mr. Pinho to P-\n       T-I. If acceptable then the matter would be\n       dismissed once he was placed in P-T-I – and since\n       Mr. Pinho has been accepted into P-T-I, I think\n       the previous judgment of conviction can be\n       vacated.\n\nTranscript at 3, New Jersey v. Pinho, No.1009-6-92 (N.J. Super.\nCt. Mar. 10, 1998).3 The prosecutor responded, “Very good,\nJudge, I move for that dismissal if need be.” Id.

May 21, 1998).\n\n                              B.\n\n       In January 2000, Pinho applied to the Newark District\nOffice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”)\nfor an adjustment of his immigration status to “permanent\nresident” under 8 U.S.C. § 1255, based upon his marriage to a\nU.S. citizen. In a decision dated December 11, 2000, the INS\ndenied adjustment on the ground that Pinho was inadmissible to\nthe United States under 8 U.S.C. § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), which\n\n                              8\n\fprovides that “any alien convicted of, or who admits having\ncommitted, or who admits committing acts which constitute the\nessential elements of a violation of . . . any law or regulation of\na State . . . relating to a controlled substance . . . is\ninadmissible.”4 The agency reasoned that Pinho’s 1992 plea to\nCount I in New Jersey met the definition of “conviction” in\n§ 1011(a)(48)(A). That section provides:\n\n       The term ‘conviction’ means, with respect to an\n       alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien\n       entered by a court, or, if adjudication of guilt has\n       been withheld, where (i) a judge or jury has found\n       the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of\n       guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted\n       sufficient facts to warrant a finding or guilt, and\n\n       4\n       Neither the Newark District Office, the Office of\nAdministrative Appeals, the District Court, nor the government\non appeal, analyzes 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C), which provides\nthat\n\n       [a]ny alien who the consular or immigration\n       officer knows or has reason to believe is or has\n       been an illicit trafficker in any such controlled\n       substance or is or has been a knowing assister,\n       abettor, conspirator, or colluder with others in the\n       illicit trafficking in any such controlled substance,\n       is inadmissible.\n\nWe therefore express no opinion on how that provision would\napply in this case.\n\n                                9\n\f       (ii) the judge has ordered some form of\n       punishment, penalty or restraint on the alien’s\n       liberty to be imposed.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the agency relied heavily upon a Board\nof Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decision, In re Roldan, 22 I. &\nN. Dec. 512 (B.I.A. 1999), in which the agency had held that\n“an alien is considered convicted for immigration purposes upon\nthe initial satisfaction of the requirements of [8 U.S.C. §\n1101(a)(48)(A)] and that he remains convicted notwithstanding\na subsequent state action purporting to erase all evidence of the\noriginal determination of guilt through a rehabilitative\nprocedure.” Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 523. The Newark\nDistrict Director certified his decision to the Associate\nCommissioner for Examinations; the Associate Commissioner\naffirmed on June 28, 2001. The INS Office of Administrative\nAppeals affirmed on July 25, 2002.\n\n                               C.\n\n       On December 31, 2003, Pinho and his wife filed a\ncomplaint in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe denial of his adjustment of status was arbitrary, capricious\nand unlawful because his vacated state conviction should no\nlonger be a bar to his eligibility for adjustment.5\n\n       5\n        On June 30, 2004, and in the context of the previously\nfiled action, Pinho filed a motion for injunctive relief, seeking\nan order directing the Newark office to grant him an\nemployment authorization form, which was required by New\nJersey for renewal of his driver’s license. Pinho argued that\n\n                               10\n\f        Pinho’s argument in the District Court hinged on the\nstatus of his conviction under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A). The\nBIA interprets § 1101(a)(48)(A) to draw a distinction between\nconvictions vacated because of the immigrant’s subsequent\nparticipation in a rehabilitation program, and convictions\nvacated because of underlying substantive or constitutional\ndefects. See In re Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621 (B.I.A. 2003).\nPinho argued that his conviction had been vacated in settlement\nof his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, rather than as part\nof a rehabilitation program. Pinho relied largely on three cases:\nHerrera-Iniro v.

Dec. 1378 (B.I.A. 2000), and\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 621.\n\n       In Herrera-Iniro, an immigrant argued that his prior\nconviction should not be operative for immigration purposes,\nalthough he conceded that it had been vacated through a\n\n\ndenial of the authorization form was contrary to the applicable\nregulation governing eligibility, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(9). The\nparties agree that the employment authorization has been\ngranted, mooting any injunctive relief we might order. See\nLetter from Thomas E.

Christie, United States\nAttorney for the District of New Jersey, to Marcia Waldron,\nClerk of the Court, United States Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit, Sep. 9, 2005. We therefore do not have properly before\nus the question of whether the agency violated 8 C.F.R.\n§ 274a.12(c)(9) when it denied his application for employment\nauthorization.\n\n                                11\n\frehabilitative program. The court reviewed the legislative\nhistory of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), and rejected the argument, noting\nthat “[t]he emphasis that Congress placed on the original\nadmission of guilt plainly indicates that a subsequent dismissal\nof charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the\nmerits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal\nproceedings, does not vitiate that original admission.” Herrera-\nIniro, 208 F.3d at 306 (emphasis added).\n\n        In Rodriguez-Ruiz, decided a few months after Herrera-\nIniro, the BIA suspended the termination proceedings of an\nimmigrant who had pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual abuse\nunder New York law. Months after the plea, the court that had\nentered the plea entered an order explicitly vacating it; its order\nstated:\n\n       It is ORDERED, that pursuant to CPL 440,[6] the\n       judgment had in this Court on March 24, 1999\n       based upon a plea colloquy . . . convicting said\n       Defendant of the crime of Sexual Abuse 3rd and\n       the sentence of one (1) year probation are in all\n       respects vacated, on the legal merits, as if said\n       conviction had never occurred and the matter is\n       restored to the docket for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n       Article 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law,\nN.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 440, pertains to post-judgment motions.\n\n                                12\n\fRodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 1379. The government\nargued that this was merely a Roldan situation; the BIA\ndisagreed:\n\n       [W]e find that the order of the New York court\n       does not constitute a state action which purports\n       to expunge, dismiss, cancel, vacate, discharge, or\n       otherwise remove a guilty plea or other record of\n       guilt or conviction by operation of a state\n       rehabilitative statute. The New York criminal\n       law provision under which the respondent’s\n       conviction was vacated is neither an expungement\n       statute nor a rehabilitative statute.\n\nId. at 1379-80 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added).7\n\n       Finally, in Matter of Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621\n(B.I.A. 2003), the BIA explicitly endorsed the distinction\nsuggested in Herrera-Iniro. After reviewing the existing legal\nlandscape, the BIA held:\n\n       In accord with the federal court opinions applying\n       the definition of a conviction at section\n       101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, we find that there is a\n       significant distinction between convictions\n       vacated on the basis of a procedural or substantive\n\n       7\n       The BIA refused, as the government urged, to “go\nbehind” the state court judgment and question whether the state\ncourt had followed its own laws in entering the vacatur.\nRodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 1379.\n\n                               13\n\f       defect in the underlying proceedings and those\n       vacated because of post-conviction events, such\n       as rehabilitation or immigration hardships. Thus,\n       if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction\n       based on a defect in the underlying criminal\n       proceedings, the respondent no longer has a\n       “conviction” within the meaning of section\n       101(a)(48)(A). If, however, a court vacates a\n       conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of\n       the underlying criminal proceedings, the\n       respondent remains “convicted” for immigration\n       purposes.\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.\n\n       The District Court deemed Pinho’s vacated conviction a\n“conviction” for immigration purposes, reasoning that “Pinho\npled guilty in 1992, served his sentence and now asks this Court\nto ignore Congressional intent and case law to order the\n[Department of Homeland Security] to grant him an\nemployment authorization form. Based on these facts, this\nCourt cannot grant [Pinho’s] request.” Pinho v. Ashcroft, No.\n03cv6232, at 11 (D.N.J. Aug. 9, 2004). Expressing its suspicion\nthat Pinho’s ineffective assistance claim was simply an attempt\nto engineer a better position on his adjustment of status\napplication, the District Court granted the government’s motion\nfor summary judgment, and Pinho appealed.\n\n                              II.\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f        Neither the parties nor the District Court questioned\nwhether jurisdiction existed in that court, so we must therefore\nconsider the question anew.

The agency action\nat issue here satisfies these two conditions.\n\n\n       9\n        Section 1252(a)(2)(B) of Title 8 of the United States\nCode, which also strips the district courts of jurisdiction over\ndiscretionary agency determinations, is in that respect at least\npartly duplicative of the APA requirement.\n\n                                16\n\f        Finality requires exhaustion of administrative remedies.\nIf there remain steps that the immigrant can take to have an\naction reviewed within the agency, then the action is not final\nand judicial review is premature. In this case, the agency\noffered no further procedures that Pinho could invoke to have\nhis claim of statutory eligibility heard. There is no provision for\nBIA review of an AAO status-adjustment eligibility decision.\nSee 8 CFR § 3.1(b). If the agency institutes removal\nproceedings against an immigrant, then the immigrant may\nrenew his or her application during those proceedings, 8 C.F.R.\n§ 245.2, but we do not find this possibility sufficient to render\nthe AAO’s eligibility determination “tentative or interlocutory”\nin this case.\n\n       The reason is simple: if the agency does not seek to\ndeport the immigrant, there can never be an appeal within the\nagency by which any higher level of administrative authority\ncan be invoked to review the legal determination made by the\nAAO. Because applications for adjustment of status can be\nrenewed, and are often made in the first instance, during\ndeportation proceedings, those proceedings will in some cases\naddress the issues considered by the AAO, see, e.g., Herrera-\nInirio v.

Because the Department of\n\n\nis not on point. In that case, the plaintiffs “sought judicial\nreview of the refusal by the district director of the immigration\nservice to adjust their status. . . .” Id. at 986 (emphasis added).\nThe Seventh Circuit dismissed the complaint for want of\njurisdiction on the ground that “[t]he suit was premature, since,\nas the plaintiffs acknowledge, they could obtain review of the\ndistrict director’s decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals\nif and when the immigration service institutes removal (i.e.\ndeportation) proceedings against them. They have thus failed to\nexhaust their administrative remedies.” Id. (internal citation\nomitted). But the Seventh Circuit confuses the existence of a\nclaim with the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The\nMcBrearty plaintiffs were not challenging a legal determination\nof their statutory eligibility for adjustment, but rather a refusal\nto adjust their status. This distinction makes all the difference.\nThe refusal to adjust – a discretionary determination – was (as\nthe court notes) barred by § 1252(a)(2)(B). While it is true that\nthe plaintiffs could have renewed their adjustment application in\nremoval proceedings, that fact is irrelevant to the District\nCourt’s lack of jurisdiction: under Section 1252(a)(2)(B) the\ncourt had no jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had no claim at\nall, not because they had failed to exhaust a valid claim.\nMcBrearty is not about exhaustion, and is redeemed from\nmaking law without proper analysis only by its facts; it surely\ncannot be said to stand for the proposition that immigrants\nstating a legal claim – one not barred by § 1252 – must always\nwait for deportation proceedings.\n\n                                18\n\fHomeland Security (“DHS”) did not provide an avenue for\nadministrative appeal of the AAO decision, Pinho had no further\nopportunity to challenge the legality of the decision within the\nagency, and would have none at all, were he forced to await\ndeportation proceedings that the agency may or may not choose\nto institute. In Howell, the Second Circuit left open the question\nof jurisdiction where there were no pending deportation\nproceedings in which the immigrant could raise her adjustment\nclaims. Subsequently, the district court in Chen v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

In Chen,\nthe District Court found that jurisdiction did lie, explaining:\n\n       A litigant has a right to a prompt resolution of\n       decisions concerning his status affording him the\n       opportunity to make personal, educational, or\n       career plans. . . . Chen has exhausted his\n       administrative remedies because as a denied\n       applicant not in deportation proceedings, he has\n       no further options under the regulatory or\n       statutory scheme to force a prompt decision by the\n       INS.\n\nId. at *6-7.\n\n        In our view, Chen is a proper application of the guidance\ngiven by the Supreme Court in Darby v.

[W]here the APA applies, an appeal\n\n                               19\n\fto ‘superior agency authority’ is a prerequisite to judicial review\nonly when expressly required by statute or when an\nadministrative rule requires appeal before review and the\nadministrative action is made inoperative pending that review.”\nDarby, 509 U.S. at 154. In the case at bar, not only was there no\nadministrative remedy “expressly prescribed,” but the applicable\nregulation expressly provided that there was no administrative\nappeal available. And the AAO’s decision was “operative”\nfrom the moment it was entered. A ruling that Pinho must wait\nfor possible future deportation proceedings in order to challenge\nthe AAO’s legal determination would sit ill at ease with Darby.\n\n        We hold that an AAO decision is final where there are no\ndeportation proceedings pending in which the decision might be\nreopened or challenged. But even if the possibility of renewing\nan adjustment application in future deportation proceedings\nwere thought to cast doubt on the finality of an AAO decision,\nthis case falls into one of the categories “in which the interests\nof the individual weigh heavily against requiring administrative\nexhaustion,” McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 146, namely, circumstances\nin which an “indefinite timeframe for administrative action,” id.\nat 147, results in prejudice to the individual who must await that\naction. The decision whether or not to institute deportation\nproceedings is entirely within the discretion of the agency.\nThere are no steps that Pinho can take to force the question in\norder to have his claim resolved. If the only route to the courts\nis through deportation proceedings, then the agency retains sole\ncontrol over whether an individual’s purely legal claim – one\nwhich has not been made non-reviewable by statute – may ever\n\n\n\n\n                                20\n\fbe brought before the courts.11 Such a result would be plainly\nat odds not only with the APA, but also with broader principles\nof separation of powers.12\n\n       11\n          The Fifth Circuit, in Cardoso v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769168\"><a href=\"/opinion/769168/florentina-cardoso-aurora-moran-arturo-martinez-v-janet-reno-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(5th Cir. 2000), held that denials of adjustment of status may\nreach the courts only through review of deportation proceedings.\nBecause the court did not attempt to distinguish between denials\nof adjustment of status applications, and legal determinations of\neligibility for status adjustment, it is not clear whether the\nCardoso holding has much to do with the case at hand here. In\nCardoso, the court considered three separate jurisdictional\ndismissals of immigration claims. One of them involved a claim\nthat an application for adjustment of status had been wrongly\ndenied as a matter of law. The applicant had filed for\nadjustment prior to her twenty-first birthday. However, the\nagency did not rule on the application for three years, at which\npoint it denied the application on the grounds that the applicant\nwas no longer eligible because she was no longer a minor. Id.\nat 514. The court held that the applicant could not invoke\njudicial review because the agency decision was not final,\nalthough it conceded that there were no deportation proceedings\npending against the applicant. Id. at 518. We think it important\nas a matter of administrative law to distinguish between\n(reviewable) non-discretionary legal determinations, and (non-\nreviewable) discretionary determinations. Because the Fifth\nCircuit did not do so, we cannot tell with certainty whether we\nare in conflict on the question resolved in this case.\n       12\n       See, e.g., Cynthia R. Farina, Statutory Interpretation\nand the Balance of Power in the Administrative State, 89\n\n                               21\n\f       It is also apparent that legal consequences flow directly\nfrom the determination that Pinho was not eligible for\nadjustment of status because of his prior conviction. In addition\nto the ineligibility determination itself, which prevented him\nfrom being considered for adjustment, the AAO’s ruling had as\na direct result the subsequent denial by the District Office of\nPinho’s application for employment authorization. That\nauthorization was required, inter alia, for the renewal of Pinho’s\ndriver’s license and for his continued employment. Both the\nagency’s obligations – to consider Pinho’s application for\nadjustment – and Pinho’s rights – to be considered for\nadjustment, and to renew his driver’s license – were determined\nby the AAO’s ruling. The determination itself and the denial of\nthe employment authorization are clear adverse effects, and raise\nthe possibility that Pinho “may suffer irreparable harm if unable\nto secure immediate judicial consideration of his claim,”\n\n\nColum. L. Rev. 452, 495-96 (1989) (“By the time of the\nratification, the prevailing understanding of separation of\npowers was no longer a simplistic call for absolute segregation\nof conceptually distinct functions. The experience between\nindependence and the Constitutional Convention had caused\nAmerican political theorists to rethink the nature of\ngovernmental authority. They came to conclude that . . . all\npower in government shared the same fundamental quality: it\nwas dangerous unless adequately offset and controlled. And so\n. . . the words ‘separation of powers’ came to connote something\nfar more subtle and intricate than a mere, abstractly logical\ndivision. The phrase expressed the expectation that, through the\ncarefully orchestrated disposition and sharing of authority,\nrestraint would be found in power counterbalancing power.”).\n\n                               22\n\fMcCarthy, 503 U.S. at 147, if he is prohibited from driving or\nworking while awaiting the uncertain possibility of future\nagency proceedings.\n\n        We must also ask whether the action at issue here was\ndiscretionary. It is important to distinguish carefully between a\ndenial of an application to adjust status, and a determination that\nan immigrant is legally ineligible for adjustment of status. This\ndistinction is central to the question of subject-matter\njurisdiction, and is easy to elide. Indeed, such distinctions are\ncrucial to administrative law generally; the framework of\njudicial review of agency action that has evolved over the past\nhalf-century is grounded in a sharp distinction between\ndecisions committed to agency discretion, and decisions,\nwhether “ministerial” or “purely legal,” governed directly by the\napplicable statute or regulation. See, e.g., Norton v. Southern\nUtah Wilderness Alliance, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136985\"><a href=\"/opinion/136985/norton-v-southern-utah-wilderness-alliance/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004); Webster v.

Whatever the label, our caselaw\ndistinguishes between actions which an agency official may\nfreely decide to take or not to take, and those which he is\nobligated by law to take or not to take. In the case of adjustment\nof status, an eligible immigrant may have his application denied\nwithin the discretion of the agency. But the immigrant’s\neligibility itself is determined by statute. To treat all denials of\nadjustment as discretionary, even when based on eligibility\ndeterminations that are plainly matters of law, is to\nfundamentally misunderstand the relationship between the\nexecutive and the judiciary.\n\n      In Soltane, 381 F.3d at 143, we considered the question\nwhether an AAO determination of statutory eligibility for a\n\n                                23\n\fparticular immigration classification is discretionary. We held\nthat it is not. In that case, Camphill Soltane, a non-profit\norganization filed a petition on behalf of an employee for\nclassification as a special religious worker. The District Office\ndenied the petition, and Soltane appealed to the AAO, which\naffirmed the District Office. Soltane then sought review of the\nAAO decision in district court. We held that, under the APA\nand 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(B)(ii), review of AAO decisions is\nwithin the jurisdiction of the district court so long as those\ndecisions are not committed to agency discretion, and that the\ndetermination of whether Soltane met the specific eligibility\ncriteria set out in the governing statute was not discretionary.\nSoltane, 381 F.3d at 147-48. Since Soltane, the REAL ID Act,\nPub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005), has further\nrestricted the jurisdiction of the district courts to review\ndiscretionary agency actions. Non-discretionary actions,\nhowever, and purely legal determinations made by the agency,\nremain subject to judicial review. See, e.g., Sepulveda v.\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790168\"><a href=\"/opinion/790168/luis-sepulveda-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (2d Cir. 2005)\n(“[Section]1252(a)(2)(B) does not bar judicial review of\nnondiscretionary, or purely legal, decisions. . . .”).\n\n        Determination of eligibility for adjustment of status –\nunlike the granting of adjustment itself – is a purely legal\nquestion and does not implicate agency discretion. The\ndetermination at issue here, whether a prior conviction precludes\neligibility for adjustment of status, was also at issue in\nSepulveda. In that case, the Second Circuit held that statutory\nrestrictions on the jurisdiction of district courts to hear\nchallenges to removal orders and other discretionary actions do\nnot affect the district courts’ “jurisdiction to determine whether\n\n                               24\n\f[the statutory provision] is applicable, e.g., whether the\npetitioner is in fact an alien, whether he has in fact been\nconvicted, and whether his offense is one that is within the\nscope of [one of the enumerated sections].” Sepulveda, 407\nF.3d at 63 (citing Santos-Salazar v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789449\"><a href=\"/opinion/789449/angel-amado-santos-salazar-v-united-states-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (2d Cir. 2005)). The determination at issue here is\nprecisely such a determination: whether under the applicable\nstatutory language as interpreted by the BIA, Pinho was\n“convicted” so as to render him ineligible for adjustment of\nstatus. This is a legal question, not one committed to agency\ndiscretion.\n\n       The agency action at issue here was final and non-\ndiscretionary, it adversely affected Pinho, and it has not been\nmade non-reviewable by statute. Under the APA, therefore,\nPinho is “entitled to judicial review” of the AAO’s decision.13\n\n      Because the District Court had jurisdiction to review the\nAAO decision, we have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28\nU.S.C § 1291. We exercise plenary review of the District\nCourt’s statutory interpretation, but afford deference to a\nreasonable interpretation adopted by the agency. See Acosta v.\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783306\"><a href=\"/opinion/783306/ramon-acosta-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (3d Cir. 2003).

INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772105\"><a href=\"/opinion/772105/jose-e-sandoval-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (7th Cir.\n2001).\n\n       The question before us is whether the terms of the order\nvacating Pinho’s 1992 conviction were such as to remove that\nconviction from the scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A), which,\nin conjunction with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A), governs the\nadmissibility of aliens to the United States.\n\n                               III.\n\n                               A.\n\n       When the Immigration and Nationality Act was first\npassed, it lacked a definition of the term “conviction.” The INS\nrelied on state law in determining whether an immigrant was\n“convicted.” See Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 514-15. State\nconvictions that were subsequently vacated were accordingly\nnot treated as “convictions” for immigration purposes. The\nagency was increasingly bedeviled by the diversity of state\nrehabilitative programs and the resulting difficulty in fashioning\na uniform national immigration policy with respect to prior\nconvictions. In In re Ozkok, 19 I. & N. Dec. 546 (B.I.A. 1988),\nthe BIA adopted a three-part definition of “conviction for the\nexpress purpose of evaluating diverse state rehabilitative\nprograms by a common measure.\n\n       When Congress included a definition of “conviction” in\nthe 1996 amendments to the INA, it used, almost verbatim, the\n\n\n\n                               26\n\ffirst two parts of the Ozkok test. The statutory definition\nprovides in its entirety:\n\n       The term “conviction” means, with respect to an\n       alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien\n       entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has\n       been withheld, where –\n\n\n\n       i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the\n       alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo\n       contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to\n       warrant a finding of guilt, and\n\n       ii) the judge has ordered some form of\n       punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s\n       liberty to be imposed.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A).14\n\n      The new definition is disjunctive, encompassing at least\ntwo possible procedural contexts. The first disjunct is “a formal\njudgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.” The meaning\n\n       14\n          See Ozkok, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 551-52. The third part of\nthe test, which was omitted from the statutory definition, dealt\nwith pre-judgment probation, and provided that such probation\nwould be sufficient for a “conviction” if “a judgment of\nconviction or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the person\nviolates the terms of the probation . . .” Id. at 552.\n\n                               27\n\fof this clause is plain enough, echoing as it does the dictionary\ndefinition, see Webster’s Third New International Dictionary at\n499 (“. . . the act of proving, finding, or adjudging a person\nguilty of an offense or crime.”), and thus offers no solution to\nthe problem of withheld judgments. That job is handled by the\nsecond disjunct – those situations in which “adjudication of guilt\nhas been withheld.” “Withhold” means “. . . to desist or refrain\nfrom granting . . . to keep in one’s possession or control.”\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary at 2627. The\ndefinition provides that in situations in which the judge refrains\nfrom granting a judgment of conviction, the defendant will\nnonetheless stand “convicted” for immigration purposes if he\nhas pleaded or been found guilty or admitted sufficient facts to\nsupport a finding of guilt, and the judge has imposed some\npenalty upon him. In our recent decision in Acosta v. Ashcroft,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783306\"><a href=\"/opinion/783306/ramon-acosta-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2003), we considered whether the\ndefinition covered a defendant who pleaded nolo contendere and\ncompleted a period of probation, and whose indictment was\nsubsequently dismissed. We accepted the BIA’s position, as set\nforth in Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. 512, that the new definition\nrequires treating a person in that situation as “convicted.”\n\n        Section 1101(a)(48)(A), thus, by its terms and by the\nBIA’s interpretation, plainly encompasses at least those\nsituations in which an alien has a judgment of guilt entered by\na court, and those in which the judgment of guilt was never\nentered because it was withheld, but where the alien has pleaded\nor admitted sufficient facts, and some penalty was imposed.\nThere remains the question of how the statute applies to\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\fconvictions that are imposed but subsequently vacated.15 We\nhave not had occasion to review the agency’s interpretation of\n§ 1101(a)(48)(A) with respect to vacated convictions, or with\nrespect to distinctions among vacated convictions.\n\n       Nothing in the statute specifically addresses vacated\nconvictions. Clearly they are not convictions that have been\nwithheld. If they are covered, then, it will be under the first\ndisjunct: “a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a\ncourt.” Undoubtedly a conviction that is later vacated by a court\nmust have been initially entered by a court. The statute is\nentirely silent with respect to the subsequent procedural history\nof a “judgment entered by a court,” and the undoubted\ncongressional purpose of closing the “withheld judgment”\nloophole tells us nothing whatsoever about what Congress’s\npurpose was with respect to vacaturs, or whether it had any\npurpose at all in that regard.16\n\n       15\n          For our purposes here, we will treat the terms “vacated”\nand “expunged,” which appear variously in the BIA opinions, as\nsynonymous. The salient procedural situation is one in which\na conviction is voided or invalidated, “dismiss[ed], cancel[ed]\n. . . discharge[d] or otherwise remove[d],” Sandoval v. I.N.S.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772105\"><a href=\"/opinion/772105/jose-e-sandoval-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (7th Cir. 2001), whatever the label, and\nwhatever the subsequent availability of the record of the\nconviction.\n       16\n        Cf. Acosta, 341 F.3d at 226 n.6 (“[W]e infer a\ncongressional intent not to incorporate . . . a distinction\n[“between rehabilitative statutes that defer[] adjudication and\nthose which expunge[] a prior admission or adjudication of\n\n                               29\n\f        The statutory provision governing inadmissibility, 8\nU.S.C. §1182(a)(2)(A), provides that “any alien convicted of, or\nwho admits committing acts which constitute the essential\nelements of . . . a violation of . . . any law or regulation of a\nState . . . is inadmissible.”17 However broad that language may\nappear, the agencies charged with implementing the statute have\nnever read it to state a blanket deportability rule. The BIA’s\ncurrent interpretation distinguishes between what we may call\n“rehabilitative” vacaturs and “substantive” vacaturs. The\nagency’s position is that\n\n       if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction\n       based on a defect in the underlying criminal\n       proceedings, the respondent no longer has a\n       “conviction” within the meaning of section\n       101(a)(48)(A). If, however, a court vacates a\n       conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of\n       the underlying criminal proceedings, the\n\n\n\nguilt”] into the INA, but we do not infer that the elimination of\nsuch a distinction was the sole purpose of passing the revised\ndefinition of conviction in Section 101(a)(48)(A).”\n       17\n         It is conceivable, of course, that under § 1182(a)(2)(A)\nan immigrant might have admitted committing the relevant acts\neven where the § 1101(a)(48)(A) definition of “conviction” does\nnot encompass the circumstances of his conviction. We need\nnot decide this question here, because in this case, the admission\nand the guilty plea are one and the same. Had he been admitted\nto the PTI program, he need not have admitted anything.\n\n                               30\n\f       respondent remains “convicted” for immigration\n       purposes.\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.\n\n       The BIA, in the cases leading up to Pickering, was faced\nwith applying the new definition to three distinct sets of\ncircumstances. The easy cases are those like Roldan, in which\nthe judgment of guilt is never entered, but is withheld pending\ncompletion of a rehabilitative program. These cases are\nstraightforwardly covered by the statutory definition, and\nRoldan breaks no new ground. The second category are cases\nin which a judgment is entered, but later vacated explicitly in\norder to prevent deportation or other federal immigration\nconsequences. Pickering considered this type of case, and held\nthe conviction to remain in force under the definition. The third\ncategory are cases in which a judgment is entered, but later\nvacated because of substantive defects in the initial proceeding.\nRodriguez-Ruiz was such a case, and the BIA held the\nconviction not to fall within the scope of the definition.\n\n        The BIA, in short, interprets §§ 1148 and 1182 to create\na distinction between vacated convictions based on the reasons\nfor the vacatur. We have not yet decided whether the distinction\ndrawn by the agency between rehabilitative and substantive\nvacaturs is a reasonable one in light of the statutory language,18\n\n       18\n         Our decision in Acosta pertains only to deferred\njudgments; as we noted, the “charges against [Acosta] were\nultimately dismissed without any adjudication of guilt.” 341\nF.3d at 221.\n\n                               31\n\fnor have we decided – as we must in this case – how we, and the\nagency, are to tell the difference.\n\n                                 B.\n\n        We will not disturb an agency’s settled, authoritative\ninterpretation of a statute it is charged with implementing unless\nthat interpretation is plainly unreasonable in light of the plain\nlanguage of the statute taken as a whole.

The\nmost comprehensive explanation of the agency’s interpretation\nis found in Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 515-20. Relying on the\njoint conference report, the BIA noted the “Congressional intent\nthat even in cases where adjudication is ‘deferred,’ the original\nfinding or confession of guilt is sufficient to establish a\n‘conviction’ for purposes of the immigration laws.” Roldan, 22\nI. & N. Dec. at 518 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, at\n224 (1996)). The BIA then analogized from deferred\nadjudications to vacated convictions, and discerned a “clear\nindication that Congress intends that the determination of\nwhether an alien is convicted for immigration purposes be fixed\nat the time of the original determination of guilt, coupled with\nthe imposition of some punishment.” Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec.\nat 521. The statute, of course, says nothing about vacated\nconvictions. Still less does the statute, or the legislative history,\naddress the distinction between rehabilitative and substantive\nvacaturs. Nor, finally, was the question of vacated convictions\nproperly before the BIA in Roldan: Roldan’s judgment was\ndeferred, not vacated. Nonetheless, the BIA opined that “it\nsimply would defy logic for us, in a case concerning a\n\n                                 32\n\fconviction in a state which effects rehabilitation through the\ntechnical erasure of the record of conviction, to provide greater\ndeference to that state’s determination that a conviction no\nlonger exists [than to a state which “never considered him\nconvicted”].” Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 521. By this\ninference, the BIA corralled within § 1101(a)(48)(A) all post-\nconviction expungement procedures that are analogous to\nwithholding judgment.19 This analogy paves the road from\nRoldan to Pickering.

It is certainly true that deferred judgments and\nexpungements are different, and it may well be that a sound\nimmigration policy would take that difference into account, but\nwe do not sit in judgment of the soundness of immigration\npolicy: the question before us is simply whether the language\nof § 1101(a)(48)(A) may reasonably be read by the agency as\nencompassing both.\n\n                               33\n\fhave existed” is to follow the rabbit into a metaphysical hole\nwhere courts rightly fear to tread.20\n\n      Roldan’s holding is expressly limited to convictions\nvacated under “rehabilitative procedure[s]”; the BIA\nemphasized that its decision\n\n       does not address the situation where the alien has\n       had his or her conviction vacated by a state court\n       on direct appeal, wherein the court determines\n       that vacation of the conviction is warranted on the\n       merits, or on grounds relating to a violation of a\n       fundamental statutory or constitutional right in the\n       underlying criminal proceedings.\n\nRoldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 523. In Rodriguez-Ruiz, the BIA\ntakes it as given that such a vacated conviction would not be a\nconviction under § 1101(a)(48)(A). There was little need to\nexplain that assumption, because the INS did not argue\notherwise, contending only that the vacatur at issue was not\n“warranted on the merits.”\n\n\n       20\n          This is the jurisprudential cousin of the “grandfather”\ntime-travel hypothetical: would it be possible to go back in time\nand murder one’s own grandfather? Does a court – even one of\ngeneral jurisdiction – have the power to declare that an earlier\nevent never happened? See, e.g., Hon. Leon R.

The BIA\nheld as early as 1943 that an expunged conviction was not a\n“conviction” for immigration purposes, and adhered to that\nposition with only occasional exceptions until Roldan.

The BIA reiterated the rule – that with\nthe exception of drug convictions, expunged convictions are not\n“convictions” – right up to the passage of the 1996 IIRIRA\namendments. In 1996, the Board held:\n\n       We agree with the respondent that if his\n       conviction has been expunged . . . he is no longer\n       deportable. . . .

However, an exception to this\n       rule exists for expunged drug convictions. . . .\n       Congress did not intend for aliens convicted of\n       drug offenses to escape deportation on the basis\n       of a state procedure authorizing a technical\n       erasure of the conviction.

Certainly the statutory language as\nenacted closes any definitional loophole through which withheld\njudgments might escape the “conviction” label. But the BIA’s\nanalogy to the “withheld judgment” prong of the statutory\ndefinition pulls with it only rehabilitative vacaturs. The\n“hallowed principle of precedent . . . going back over fifty\nyears,” James A. R. Nafziger & Michael Yimesgen, The Effect\nof Expungement on Removability of Non-Citizens, 36 U. Mich.\nJ.L. Reform 915, 930 (2003) – that is, the government’s long\nhistory of treating vacated convictions as nullities for\nimmigration purposes – was preserved for those vacaturs that\nwere not the functional equivalent of rehabilitative withheld\njudgments – those vacaturs, in other words, that were based on\nunderlying defects in the conviction itself.\n\n       The BIA has not explained precisely why it thinks\nsubstantive vacaturs do not fit the §1101(a)(48)(A) definition.\nThe foregoing account, however, is sufficient to support our\ndetermination that the distinction is reasonable.22 Given its\n\n       22\n         We do not, accordingly, read the statute as requiring\nunambiguously that all convictions, even those vacated because\nof substantive defects, are included in the definition.

In Renteria-Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit, in holding that\na guilty plea followed by a Judicial Recommendation Against\nDeportation (“JRAD”) remains a conviction for immigration\npurposes, observed that “five circuits, including this court, have\nconcluded that a vacated or otherwise expunged state conviction\nremains valid under § 1101(a)(48)(A),” 322 F.3d at 814, which\nis true enough if we interpret “a” to mean “some” rather than\n“all” (that is, “a vacated conviction may remain valid” as\nopposed to “a vacated conviction must remain valid”). The use\nof the ambiguous phrasing is misleading in this context, because\nthe other circuits listed, and now this Court, accept the\ndistinction made by the BIA between convictions which do\nremain valid and convictions which do not. Indeed, in Renteria-\nGonzalez, Judge Benavides concurred specially to emphasize\nthat “the majority opinion paints with too broad a brush . . .\n[because] none of the convictions in the five cases cited by the\nmajority was vacated based on the merits of the underlying\ncriminal proceeding, i.e., a violation of a statutory or\nconstitutional right with respect to the criminal conviction.” 322\nF. 3d at 820. Because Renteria-Gonzalez’s conviction was\nlikewise not vacated because of a substantive defect, Judge\nBenavides continues, “any indication in the majority opinion\nthat a conviction vacated based on the merits constitutes a\nconviction under § 1101(a)(48)(A) is entirely dicta. . . .” Id. at\n823 n.24.\n        The breadth of Renteria-Gonzalez’s holding remains\nunclear. Soon after the decision was issued, an immigration\njudge cited Renteria-Gonzalez in holding that a conviction that\nhad been vacated due to “procedural and substantive flaws in the\n\n                               38\n\funderlying proceeding” remained valid under § 1101(a)(48)(A),\nand the Fifth Circuit, per Judge Benavides, “reluctantly”\ndismissed the petition for review, holding that, although the\ncircuit was now “out of step with the rest of the nation,” it was\nbound by Renteria-Gonzalez.

However, the Justice Department\nsubsequently petitioned the court to vacate Discipio and remand\nthe case to the BIA for dismissal. The Justice Department\nargued that because § 1101(a)(48)(A) “is silent on the effect of\na vacated conviction on an alien’s immigration status, [the Fifth\nCircuit] should defer to the Board’s” interpretation as set forth\nin Pickering, that substantive vacaturs are not “convictions.”\nDiscipio v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"38616\"><a href=\"/opinion/38616/discipio-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2005). The panel\nagreed to remand the case, and rehearing en banc was denied as\nmoot, Id. at 450, leaving the precise holding of Renteria-\nGonzalez up in the air. At the very least, it is clear that to read\nRenteria-Gonzalez to cover susbstantive vacaturs is to stretch it\nfar beyond its facts.\n        Accepting the distinction between substantive and\nrehabilitative vacaturs not only gives proper deference to the\nagency’s interpretation, but also serves to avoid the\nconstitutional problems that might arise under a reading which\nbrings constitutionally protected conduct or constitutionally\ninfirm proceedings into the category of “conviction” – cases, for\nexample, involving an alien who was convicted of conduct\nsubsequently deemed constitutionally protected, or whose\nconviction was reversed on direct appeal because of insufficient\nevidence, or whose conviction was vacated on collateral attack\nbecause of a plain constitutional defect. The agency does not\nread the statute as encompassing such situations, however, so\n\n                                39\n\flongstanding, consistent practice, the agency may reasonably\nread the statutory language analyzed above to authorize its\ndrawing this distinction among vacated convictions. We\ntherefore begin our analysis with the proposition that an alien\nwhose conviction is vacated on collateral attack because the\nalien’s trial counsel was ineffective under the Sixth Amendment,\nno longer stands “convicted” for immigration purposes. The\nquestion is whether Pinho’s is such a case, and, more\nimportantly, how that determination is to be made.\n\n                               C.\n\n       We are thus faced with the question of just what the BIA\nmeans by “based on” and “for reasons.” It is easy enough to\ndetermine what a vacatur order is “based on” when the court\nissuing the order holds a hearing and then issues a written\ndecision, complete with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nBut not all orders come with such clear explanations. Such was\nthe order in the case at bar. Pinho filed a motion for post-\nconviction relief, and raised ineffective assistance as his only\nground. The prosecution did not answer that motion. At the\nhearing on the motion, the parties agreed that Pinho’s conviction\nwould be vacated, he would be placed in the PTI program, and\nthe charges would be dismissed. The one-sentence order of\ndismissal simply cites the PTI placement.\n\n      Facially, then, one might say that the conviction was\nvacated “based on” the parties’ agreement to Pinho’s PTI\nplacement. After all, the words of the judge at the hearing were:\n\n\nthese difficult cases have not come before us.\n\n                               40\n\f“[S]ince Mr. Pinho has been accepted into PTI, I think the\nprevious judgment of conviction can be vacated.” Acceptance\ninto PTI is, likewise, on its face a “reason[] unrelated to the\nmerits of the underlying criminal proceedings.”\n\n        But our inquiry cannot end there. The fact that the\nparties agreed to settle rather than proceed to trial on the\nineffective assistance claim should not be dispositive. Indeed,\nit may be that the likelihood that the prosecution will agree to a\nsettlement such as PTI placement will increase proportionally\nwith the strength of the alien’s constitutional claim. If the BIA\nin Pickering had meant to require an adjudication of the merits\nof aliens’ claims of substantive defects in the original conviction\nin order to make out an adequate “basis,” it could have said so.\nBut it did not. It has instead drawn its line between vacaturs\n“based on” underlying defects and vacaturs granted “for\nreasons” not related to underlying defects, and it is readily\napparent that the set of vacaturs “based on” underlying defects\nis not necessarily coextensive with the set of vacaturs based on\nadjudications of underlying defects. We must therefore inquire\nas to the reasons underlying the vacatur order, and it would\nobviously be begging the question simply to invoke the PTI\nacceptance yet again. The prosecutor’s offer of PTI placement\ndid not spring into being ex nihilo; rather, it was by way of\nsettlement of Pinho’s collateral attack on the constitutional\nvalidity of his conviction. The relevant “reason,” then, for our\nPickering analysis, is plainly the reason for the settlement\nagreement.\n\n       That agreement, as the judge states at the March 10\ncolloquy, was the “upshot” of negotiations between the\n\n                                41\n\fattorneys, who “have been dealing with this matter for several\nmonths.” The “matter” the attorneys had been “dealing with”\nwas Pinho’s motion for post-conviction relief based on\nineffective assistance of counsel. Of signal importance to this\ncase is the fact that that motion was the only pleading before the\njudge. The state did not answer the motion. At no time did\nPinho, or the state, or the judge, raise any issue other than\nineffective assistance. The government asks us to hold that the\nvacatur order was not “based on” the ineffective assistance\nmotion, even though there was no other basis for vacatur offered\nat any point in the proceedings. The government asks us, in\nother words, to hold that the agency may permissibly find a\nmotive in a state-court ruling that is nowhere stated in the\nrecord. This we decline to do.\n\n        At oral argument the government contended that the\nmotives of state prosecutors and judges might change over time\nand might not be reflected in the record. Perhaps a new\nprosecutor, reviewing old cases, might decide that some of his\npredecessor’s policies had been unduly harsh. Perhaps such a\nprosecutor, when presented with a post-conviction relief claim\nbrought by a defendant who had been denied entry into a pre-\ntrial diversion program years earlier because of a now-\ndiscredited policy, might decide to “do the right thing,” and help\nthat defendant avoid the immigration consequences of his guilty\nplea. Perhaps a state judge, looking at the case, would see a\nhard-working family man threatened with deportation based on\na relatively minor crime committed a decade earlier, and decide\nto help that hard-working family man get around the federal\nimmigration laws. Perhaps, perhaps. We present this\nhypothetical to highlight the fact that it is precisely that: a\n\n                               42\n\fhypothetical proposed by the government about possible\nmotives of state actors nowhere found in the record. Were we\nto allow the Department of Homeland Security to base its legal\ndeterminations of immigrants’ statutory eligibility for\nadjustment of status upon hypothetical scenarios such as this, we\nwould be opening the door to – indeed in many cases due\nprocess would require – a flood of subpoenas to judges and\nprosecutors of sovereign states ordering them to appear in\nfederal immigration proceedings to answer questions about\nmotives, feelings, and sympathies that appear nowhere in any\nwritten record, but that may have prompted their official actions.\nBehind the expansive interpretation of “reason” and “basis”\nurged by the government, we see the specter of such unseemly\ninquisitions.\n\n        How else, indeed, could Pinho have challenged the\nagency’s claim that the vacatur order was not “really” based on\nhis ineffective assistance claim? Would he not have to call the\nprosecutor and ask him why, exactly, he agreed to PTI\nplacement? Would he not have to call the judge and ask him\nwhy, exactly, he agreed to vacate the conviction and dismiss the\ncharges? And if the answers were unfavorable to the\ngovernment’s theory, would it not seek, in cross-examination,\nto establish that the state actors harbored secret motives, such as\nundue sympathy for an immigrant or animosity toward federal\nimmigration law?\n\n       We cannot endorse a test which requires speculation\nabout, or scrutiny of, the reasons for judges’ actions other than\n\n\n\n\n                                43\n\fthose reasons that appear on the record.23 Whether or not\nconstitutional avoidance requires this result,24 avoidance of\nabsurdities surely does.

But most important are basic\nconsiderations of comity. When, as in this case, there arises a\ndispute over the “reason” or “basis” for a decision, if the parties\nare permitted to speculate about unstated motives that perhaps\nunderlie vacatur orders, there will be little alternative to calling\njudges and prosecutors as witnesses in immigration proceedings.\n\n       23\n         Cf. Sandoval, 240 F.3d at 583 (“The INS also alleges\nthat the modification [of Sandoval’s conviction] was entered\nsolely for immigration purposes, and is thus ineffective. This\nallegation is unfounded. The judge’s modification was in\nresponse to Sandoval’s properly filed motion stating a\ncognizable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. That\nSandoval may have filed his motion in response to the threat of\ndeportation is irrelevant.

The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly emphasized that state courts are the ultimate\nauthorities on the meaning of state law.

That practice reflects our\nunderstanding that the decisions of state courts are definitive\npronouncements of the will of the States as sovereigns.” Id.\nRecognizing the force of this longstanding principle, the BIA\ncorrectly declined the government’s invitation in Rodriguez-\nRuiz to “look behind” a state-court ruling and decide whether\nthat ruling was correct under state law.25            The same\nconsiderations govern the search for unstated motives: both\ncontravene long-settled principles of federalism. A state law\nmay be declared unconstitutional; it may not, however, simply\nbe rewritten. So too, we hold, with vacatur orders.\n\n       The government could have avoided this problem\naltogether.

Given the expansive statutory definition of\n“conviction,” and the deference the agency’s interpretation is\nowed, the agency could have chosen to contend that as a matter\nof federal law all vacated state convictions remain “convictions”\nunder § 1101(a)(48)(A), whether rehabilitative or substantive.\nIf the agency wishes to adopt this interpretation of the statutory\ndefinition it may do so, through rulemaking or adjudication, and\nit may defend that interpretation before the courts. But the\nagency has not done so, and it is another matter entirely for the\nagency to distinguish among vacated convictions based on the\nreasons for the vacatur, and then to arrogate to itself the power\nto find hidden reasons lurking beneath the surface of the rulings\nof state courts. Under the Supremacy Clause, the Department of\nHomeland Security may, pursuant to statutory authority,\nproperly interpret § 1101 (a)(48)(A) to encompass convictions\nvacated by order of state courts. But it is far from clear that it\nmay rewrite state-court rulings as to the legal basis for those\norders. Our Federalism has not yet come to that.\n\n                                D.\n\n\n\n                                46\n\f        In this case, the District Court openly expressed its\nsuspicion that Pinho’s ineffective assistance motion was, sub\nsilentio, something else entirely. “It is troubling that [Pinho]\nadmitted guilt, served his sentence and then waited\napproximately three years to seek post-conviction relief based\non ineffective assistance. . . .” Pinho v. Ashcroft, No. 03cv6232,\nat 10 (D.N.J. Aug. 9, 2004). The District Court then turned for\nguidance to an unpublished district court opinion, Lim v.\nAshcroft,26 involving similar issues, noting that “Chief Judge\nBissell shared the same concerns of this Court,” namely “that\nthere was no reason for the state to entertain petitioner’s post-\nconviction motion for any purpose other than to benefit\npetitioner before the INS or this Court. . . .” Id. at 11. The\nDistrict Court then stated explicitly that “Chief Judge Bissell’s\nopinion in Lim . . . is a factor in denying Plaintiff’s motion.” Id.\nThe District Court’s quasi-adoption of Lim is noteworthy for\nmore than its procedural irregularity. In Lim the district court\naccused the state judge and prosecutor of being practitioners, or\nwilling victims, of outright duplicity. A brief discussion of Lim\nis therefore warranted here, because it is an object lesson in the\npitfalls of the government’s proposed approach.\n\n        Lim pled guilty in New Jersey in 1996 to kidnapping; in\n1998, the INS began removal proceedings. In 2001, Lim sought\npostconviction relief in state court, contending that he had\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel, and petitioned the\ndistrict court to stay deportation pending exhaustion of the state\n\n       26\n         Lim v.

We remind the District Court that\nunpublished district court opinions are not a source of law.\n\n                                47\n\fclaim. After the state court granted Lim post-conviction relief,\nthe district court took it upon itself to review the state court’s\nstate-law ruling,27 and declared the entire proceeding to be a\n\n       27\n         The court summarized the proceedings as follows:\n\n       [T]he transcript shows that at the outset the court\n       was presented with an arrangement in the nature\n       of a plea agreement, that had been reached prior\n       to the hearing between Mr. Lim and state\n       authorities. Pursuant to the arrangement, the\n       following actions were taken at the hearing:\n       (1) the state court permitted Mr. Lim to withdraw\n       his earlier plea to the kidnapping charge and enter\n       a plea of guilty to a charge in the original\n       indictment of aggravated assault; (2) the court\n       vacated the kidnapping conviction and stated that\n       the date of the new plea should be treated for\n       immigration purposes as having been entered on\n       March 18, 1996 (a fictitious date as far as the\n       record reveals); (3) the state dismissed voluntarily\n       the remaining charges; (4) the court sentenced\n       Mr. Lim to time served. All agreed that the\n       foregoing arrangement’s purpose was to facilitate\n       Mr. Lim in avoiding deportation; by attempting to\n       amend the date of conviction, Mr. Lim and his\n       counsel sought to avoid the AEDPA amendment\n       and preserve his eligibility for Section 212(c)\n       consideration.\n\nLim, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1967945</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\n\n                               48\n\fsham: “[T]his Court determines that there was a significantly\ndeficient legal foundation for the state court’s vacation of Mr.\nLim’s kidnapping conviction.” Lim, No. 01-CV-3271, at *5.\nRegardless of what the state court said it found, according to the\ndistrict court, it did not “really” find ineffective assistance. The\nDistrict Court concluded that a hidden motive was at work:\n\n       [I]n accommodating the proposed plea\n       arrangement, the state court acted not on the basis\n       of a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance of\n       counsel, but for some other reason. . . . The [state\n       court’s own] remarks unmistakably show that the\n       state court vacated the kidnapping conviction out\n       of concern for Mr. Lim’s immigration plight, not\n       because there was any merit in his collateral\n       attack on the kidnapping charge.\n\nId. at *9. The prosecutor and the judge were, according to the\ndistrict court, played for fools; they were made the dupes of a\nconniving lawyer who “played to the[ir] interests” in\n“contriv[ing] a fictional disposition . . . as a means to subvert\nfederal statutes.” Id. at *10. The post-conviction relief petition\nwas thus a fraud: “[I]t is apparent that the petition for post-\nconviction relief that was pursued in this case was not used to\ntest the merit of Mr. Lim’s claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, but rather as a vehicle to engineer a result that would\nbenefit petitioner in proceedings before the INS or this\nCourt. . . .” Id. at *9.\n\n      The concern, then, that the District Court in this case\n“shared” with the court in Lim is that the integrity of legal\n\n                                49\n\fproceedings in state courts cannot be trusted. This Court does\nnot approve of accusations of dishonesty or complicity in\n“subversion” leveled at state courts and prosecutors. We will\nnot accept an interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality\nAct that permits, let alone requires, speculation by federal\nagencies about the secret motives of state judges and\nprosecutors.\n\n        The temptation to second-guess the motives of state\nofficials is a predictable byproduct of inadequate judicial\nguidance as to the permissible bounds of agency inquiry into the\nbasis for state-court actions. The powers of immigration\nofficials are extensive, and if immigrants are to have any\ncertainty as to the effect criminal proceedings in state courts\nmay have on their immigration status, those bounds must be\ndrawn plainly and brightly. Where definitions are broad, so\nmust they be clear. It cannot be the case that whether a\nconviction is a conviction depends on whether an immigration\nofficial suspects a state judge of secretly harboring subversive\nmotives. If the relationship between state criminal proceedings\nand federal immigration proceedings is to be governed by the\nrule of law, then that law must be a law of rules.\n\n        We therefore announce the following categorical test for\nclassification of vacated convictions under the INA.28 To\ndetermine the basis for a vacatur order, the agency must look\n\n       28\n         Although Judge McKee agrees with the rationale and\nresult of our decision, he does not agree that we need to\nestablish a formal test to properly resolve this appeal. He\ntherefore does not endorse the majority’s categorical test.\n\n                              50\n\ffirst to the order itself. If the order explains the court’s reasons\nfor vacating the conviction, the agency’s inquiry must end there.\nIf the order does not give a clear statement of reasons, the\nagency may look to the record before the court when the order\nwas issued. No other evidence of reasons may be considered.29\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           Our test is informed by our decisions in United States\nv. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728095\"><a href=\"/opinion/728095/united-states-v-kevin-e-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1996), and United States v.\nJoshua, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592082\"><a href=\"/opinion/592082/united-states-v-aubrey-joshua/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1992). In those cases we had to\ndetermine how to classify a prior crime for purposes of the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines. We held that “a sentencing\ncourt should look solely to the conduct alleged in the count of\nthe indictment charging the offense of conviction. . . .” Taylor,\n98 F.3d at 771 (quoting Joshua, 976 F.2d at 856). Thus, to\ndetermine whether a prior crime was a “crime of violence,” the\nsentencing court could look only at the conduct alleged in the\nindictment for the count which was proved or admitted. The\ncourt could not look outside the indictment to determine whether\nthe defendant actually committed other acts which did not\nappear in the indictment on that count.\n         Our test also accords deference to the BIA’s formulation\nin Pickering, which provides that “in making this determination\n[of the basis for a vacatur] we look to the law under which the\n. . . court issued its order and the terms of the order itself, as well\nas the reasons presented by the respondent in requesting that the\ncourt vacate the conviction.” Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 625.\n\n                                  51\n\f                               IV.\n\n       Applying this rule to the case at hand is straightforward.\nIn his pleading, Pinho raised only one claim: ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The state did not file an answer. The\njudge’s vacatur order refers to the PTI placement agreement,\nwhich was reached in settlement of Pinho’s ineffective\nassistance claim. The only basis for the vacatur appearing in the\norder or the pleadings is Pinho’s ineffective assistance claim.\nUnder the distinction articulated in Pickering, therefore, Pinho’s\nconviction was vacated “based on a defect in the underlying\ncriminal proceedings,” and Pinho accordingly “no longer has a\n‘conviction’ within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A).”\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.\n\n       The AAO therefore erred as a matter of law in\ndetermining Pinho to be ineligible for adjustment of status under\n§§ 1101 and 1182, and the District Court erred in affirming that\ndetermination. We wish to emphasize that while we may, and\nmust, ensure that purely legal determinations are made by the\nagency in accordance with law, the decision whether in fact to\ngrant adjustment of status is a matter entrusted to the discretion\nof the agency, and we lack the power to review denials of\nadjustment applications as such. When we have instructed the\nagency on the correct legal standard, we have said all that we\nmay say. We will accordingly reverse the judgment below and\nremand to the District Court for the granting of relief consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               52\n\f</pre>",
