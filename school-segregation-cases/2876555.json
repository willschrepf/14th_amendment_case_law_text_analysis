It covers approximately 225 square miles of\nagricultural land, including the towns of Wabasso and Vesta. The district operated\nelementary schools in both Wabasso and Vesta until the 1983-84 school year. It closed\nthe Vesta elementary school and sold the building in May 1984. Thereafter, the Vesta\nchildren attended the Wabasso school, which is approximately fourteen miles from\nVesta.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f       Lloyd Paskewitz bought the old Vesta elementary school building in 1991.\nPaskewitz and several other Vesta families are members of a religious group known as\nthe Brethren, a group that originated in Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s.1 See Bryan\nRonald Wilson, “The Brethren” A Recent Sociological Study (1981). (Appellees’ App.\nEx. W.) It is undisputed that the Brethren have a sincerely held religious belief in\navoiding the use of technology, including televisions, radios, videos, films, and\ncomputers.\n\n       In August 1992, Paskewitz, on behalf of several of the Vesta Brethren families,\nwrote to Dr. George Bates, the district’s superintendent, about the possibility of\nreopening the Vesta elementary school in the form of a multi-age classroom. Paskewitz\noffered to lease space in the old school to the district in consideration of the district’s\nproviding a teacher and supplies. Paskewitz’s letter stated, “[w]e would have no\nobjection to it being a public school,” but requested that “the charter of the school in\nVesta” contain a clause stating “[t]hat no T.V., Radios, Videos, and Computers be\nused.” Paskewitz stated that there were approximately twenty-one Brethren children\nthat would be interested in attending and that the group had heard that other, non-\nBrethren children might be interested in attending the Vesta school. Paskewitz’s letter\nalso noted that the Brethren children would not require transportation or school\nlunches, as the children could walk to school and would go home for lunch in\naccordance with their religious beliefs.\n\n       Dr. Bates attested that he considered the feasibility of opening a multi-age\nclassroom in Vesta. He stated that the primary benefits of such a classroom included\nthe reduction in the number of students being bussed to Wabasso, the availability of an\nadditional multi-age classroom, the reduction in class sizes in grade-specific\nclassrooms, and the alleviation of space shortage in the Wabasso building. He noted\n\n\n      1\n      Paskewitz estimated that approximately 115 of the 300 people living in Vesta\nare members of the Brethren.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fthat the relative costs of the proposed classroom were minimal. After holding public\nmeetings, the school board unanimously approved the proposal. Members of the\nschool board attested that they approved the opening of the Vesta school for several\nreasons, most of which were financial. Opening the Vesta school would prevent the\nBrethren children from possibly being home-schooled, which would have meant a loss\nin state aid of roughly $3,200 for each student withdrawn from school. A Vesta school\neliminated the need to bus Vesta students to Wabasso, and it was more economical to\nsend one teacher to Vesta than to bus Vesta children to Wabasso. Additionally,\nopening a multi-age classroom in Vesta would provide educational benefits for those\nstudents who otherwise might have been home-schooled. Dr. Bates and the school\nboard members attested that during the approval process they did not discuss the\nreligious backgrounds of the parents or students who might attend the Vesta school, nor\nwere those religious backgrounds relevant to their decision.\n\n       A three-year lease was signed on October 12, 1993, by the district, Paskewitz,\nand the Brethren.2 The lease provided that the Vesta school would be operated by the\ndistrict in the form of a multi-age classroom and would be “a public school for any\nresident student in the School District.” The district would provide teachers and\nadministrative services, establish the curriculum “in compliance with state laws and\nrules,” and provide classroom materials for instruction. The parents of the Brethren\nchildren would “have the right to comment on and provide input regarding” classroom\nmaterials “to the same extent as other parents in the School District,” but the district\nretained “the sole discretion” regarding “final approval” of textbooks and instructional\nmaterials. The lease provided that “[t]he School District shall, to the extent permitted\nunder applicable law and rules and regulations . . . limit the use of technology such as\n\n      2\n        Although the “Brethern” [sic] was an additional party to the lease, the person\nwho signed the lease allegedly on the Brethren’s behalf has attested that he had no\nauthority to do so. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that the Brethren\nhad any ownership interest in the Vesta school building. Thus, we find little\nsignificance in the fact that they are a party to the lease.\n\n                                          -4-\n\ftelevision, radio, audio and/or video recordings, computers and movies in the\nclassrooms at the school.” The district would provide special education, certain\nfederally funded educational services, and counseling services, as well as instruction\nin health, physical education, and music at the Wabasso School to any Vesta students\nneeding them.3 The lease stated that “[a]ll policies adopted by the [School District] . . .\nshall apply at the [Vesta] school.” Paskewitz and the Brethren agreed to pay all\nutilities, provide custodial services, repair and maintain the building and grounds, pay\nproperty taxes, provide property and liability insurance related to the building, and\nremove snow.\n\n       The district planned to operate three multi-age classrooms during the 1993-94\nschool year, two in Wabasso and one in Vesta. The district solicited students for these\nclassrooms, and fifty-four students signed up and were allowed to request which school\nthey wished to attend. Thirty-five chose the Wabasso school, and the remaining\nnineteen chose the Vesta school. Eleven parents of twenty-nine current or former\nVesta students attested that they preferred sending their children to the Vesta school\nrather than the Wabasso school because they liked the convenience of having their\nchildren attend a school within walking distance and having their children come home\nfor lunch. They also preferred the multi-age Vesta classroom to a grade-specific one\nin Wabasso.4 Although the Vesta school is open to any student in the district who\nwishes to attend there, apparently only Brethren children have attended the Vesta\nschool since it opened.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n        The lease stated that hot lunch would also be provided at the Wabasso school,\nbut the district has said that it would cater hot lunches to students at the Vesta school\nif needed.\n        4\n        The multi-age classrooms in Wabasso were open only for the 1993-94 school\nyear.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        Dr. Bates and the two Vesta teachers attested that the same elementary\ncurriculum is taught at the Vesta school as is taught at the Wabasso school.\nTechnology, in the form of computer instruction, is a standard part of that curriculum\nfor each grade level. The teachers testified that when the Vesta school first opened,\nstudents wishing computer instruction would have been bussed to the Wabasso school\nto receive it. Both attested that the district now provides computer and audio/visual\nequipment to them at the Vesta school upon request. Although technology is available\nto all students, both teachers testified that they do not regularly use technology in their\nclassroom instruction.\n\n        Minnesota law requires school districts to establish a procedure that allows\nparents to review the content of instructional materials provided to a minor child. If the\nparent objects to that content, the district must make reasonable arrangements for\nalternative instruction. See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 126.699 (West 1994). The district’s\npolicy allows students with religious objections to be excused from objectionable\nclasses or activities. If the class or activity is a required one, “suitable alternative\nactivities shall be provided.” Dr. Bates attested that the district has received numerous\nobjections to various activities, including the use of computer technology, drug\neducation, self-esteem training, certain books and audio and visual presentations, and\nsex education; that the district does not inquire into the motivations for a parent’s\nobjections; and that the district provides alternative instruction.\n\n       All of the Brethren parents have objected to the use of computers at the Vesta\nschool and have asked for alternative instruction for their children, which has been\nprovided. Accordingly, the educational curriculum at the Vesta school does not include\nthe use of computers, videos, films, or audio presentations. While the Brethren children\nwere attending the Wabasso school prior to the reopening of the Vesta school, the\ndistrict accommodated their religious objections and allowed them to avoid\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fparticipating in the use of technology.5 It is undisputed that, in light of the\naccommodations the district would make at the Wabasso school for the Brethren\nchildren, the Brethren children have received exactly the same education at the Vesta\nschool that they would have received if they had continued to attend the Wabasso\nschool. It is also undisputed that no religious instruction has taken place at the Vesta\nschool and that no religious artifacts are present.\n\n                                 Procedural History\n\n       Matthew Stark and Marcia Neely are Minnesota citizens utilizing taxpayer\nstanding who filed suit against the district6 seeking a declaratory judgment that the\ncreation and operation of the Vesta school violates the Establishment Clause of the\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1 section 16 of the\nMinnesota Constitution. They also sought an injunction prohibiting the district from\noperating the Vesta school in conformance with Brethren beliefs, a judgment requiring\nthe district to refund to the State of Minnesota all state aid the district received for\nchildren attending the Vesta school, and an award of attorney fees.\n\n      The case was submitted to the district court on cross-motions for summary\njudgment. The court concluded that “the facts presented by this case provide a clear\nexample of state sponsorship, or the advancement of a religion which violates the\nmandates of the First Amendment.” The court concluded that the district had modified\nthe Vesta school’s curriculum “based solely on the request of a religious group.”\n\n\n\n\n      5\n     The district also supplied the Brethren children with a separate lunch table at the\nWabasso school.\n      6\n        The plaintiffs also sued members of the school board, Paskewitz, and the\nBrethren. These defendants were dismissed at various times, and their dismissals are\nnot raised on appeal.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       The district court further concluded that the primary effect of the opening of the\nVesta school was that of promoting religion; that “the opening, and the manner of\noperation of, the Vesta school lacks a secular purpose and was done to conform to the\nreligious beliefs of the Brethren”; and that the district had thus created “an\nimpermissible identification of its powers and duties with the religious beliefs of the\nBrethren.” The court entered an injunction permanently enjoining the district “from\noperating the Vesta School or any other school in conformance with the Brethren’s\nreligious objections to the use of computers and other technology and media.” The\ncourt did not rule on the refunding of state aid money or on the matter of attorney fees.\n\n      Following the district court’s denial of the district’s motion for a stay pending\nappeal, we entered an order staying the district court’s injunction. Stark and Neely\nhave moved to dissolve the stay. Stark and Neely have dismissed their refund claim,\nand their claim for attorney fees has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.\n\n                                    First Amendment\n       We begin by noting that the decision by the district to open a school and to\naccommodate parental requests for exemption from aspects of the district’s chosen\ncurriculum falls within the heartland of the “comprehensive powers and substantial\ndiscretion” that are generally afforded to school districts in “discharg[ing] the important\ntasks entrusted to them.” Pratt v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 831, 670 F.2d 771, 775\n(8th Cir. 1982). See Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 235 (1972) (“[C]ourts are not\nschool boards or legislatures, and are ill-equipped to determine the ‘necessity’ of\ndiscrete aspects of a State’s program of compulsory education.”). Despite this\nconsiderable discretion, courts have recognized that school boards must exercise their\npowers “‘in a manner that comports with the transcendent imperatives of the First\nAmendment,’” and courts “have been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance\nwith the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools.” Edwards v.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fAguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583-84 (1987) (quoting Board of Educ., Island Trees Union\nFree Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 864 (1982)).\n\n       As the Supreme Court has stated, courts “do not . . . intervene in the resolution\nof conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not\ndirectly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values.” Epperson v. Arkansas, 393\nU.S. 97, 104 (1968). Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 115 S.\nCt. 2440, 2448 (1995) (plurality opinion) (“[O]utsiders or individual members of the\ncommunity uninformed about the school’s practice. . . . might leap to the erroneous\nconclusion of state endorsement.”).\n\n                                          A.\n\n       The applicable test for evaluating whether state action has violated the\nEstablishment Clause is that established by Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13\n(1971). See Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384,\n389 n.7 (1993) (“Lemon, however frightening it may be to some, has not been\noverruled.”). “In order to satisfy the Lemon test, a challenged governmental action\nmust (1) have a secular purpose, (2) not have the primary or principal effect of\nadvancing religion, and (3) not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.” Good\nNews/Good Sports Club v. School Dist. of Ladue, 28 F.3d 1501, 1508 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(footnote omitted) (citing Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13). See also Agostini v. Felton,\nNos. 96-552 & 96-553, 1997 WL 338583, at *19 (U.S. June 23, 1997) (“Thus, it is\nsimplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat it . . . as an aspect of\nthe inquiry into a statute’s effect.”).\n\n       The decision to open a school in Vesta furthers the valid secular purpose of\neducating the district’s children. See Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 395 (1983) (state\nhas “secular purpose of ensuring that the State’s citizenry is well educated”); Wolman\nv. Walter, 433 U.S. 229, 240 (1977) (“There is no question that the State has a\n\n                                          -9-\n\fsubstantial and legitimate interest in insuring that its youth receive an adequate secular\neducation.”); Everson v. Board of Educ. of Ewing Tp., 330 U.S. 1, 7 (1947) (“It is\nmuch too late to argue that legislation intended to facilitate the opportunity of children\nto get a secular education serves no public purpose.”). The district’s decision to open\nthe school in Vesta was based upon the secular reasons of space efficiency, savings in\ntransportation costs, and the addition of a multi-age classroom and corresponding\nreduction in class sizes. Further, the decision forestalled the plans of certain parents\nto home-school their children and thus prevented a reduction in the amount of state aid\nflowing to the district, funding that benefits all students within the district.\n\n       Relying primarily on School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373 (1985),\nand Parents Ass’n of P.S. 16 v. Quinones, 803 F.2d 1235 (2d Cir. 1986), the district\ncourt concluded that the primary effect of the district’s decision to open the school at\nVesta was to promote religion. The court noted that the Vesta school is perceived as\na Brethren school and that the district had thus “create[d] an impermissible\nidentification of its powers and duties with the religious beliefs of the Brethren.”\n\n      Quinones involved a plan to educate Hasidic Jewish girls at a public school by\nphysically separating a group of classrooms from the rest of the school and dedicating\nthem for their use, and providing only female public school teachers who would teach\nprimarily in Yiddish, with English taught as a second language. See Quinones, 803\nF.2d at 1237. The Second Circuit concluded that this plan created “a symbolic link\nbetween the state and the Hasidic sect” which appeared to endorse the separatist\nreligious views of the Hasidic Jews and that the plan thus failed the primary effect test.\nSee id. at 1241-42.\n\n      This case is distinguishable because the Vesta school does not involve the\ncomplete segregation and dedication of part or all of a public facility to a group of\nstudents for religious reasons as in Quinones. That portion of Grand Rapids on which\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fthe district court relied has now been overruled. See Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at\n**16, 21.\n\n       The Vesta school is a public school open to all, and there is no evidence that any\nstudents wishing to attend there have been turned away. Further, that the school\nboard’s decision to open the Vesta school coincided with certain parents’ desire to see\na public school opened in Vesta does not compel a finding that the primary effect of the\ndecision was to advance religion or that the district was sending a message of approval\nor disapproval of individual religious choices. See Clayton by Clayton v. Place, 884\nF.2d 376, 380 (8th Cir. 1989) (“The mere fact a governmental body takes action that\ncoincides with the . . . desires of a particular religious group . . . does not transform the\naction into an impermissible establishment of religion.”). Any incidental benefits to the\nBrethren’s religious beliefs are secondary to the primary effect of providing an\nadditional school for the secular education of Vesta children. Cf. Good News/Good\nSports Club, 28 F.3d at 1508 (incidental benefits to religion from policy of allowing\ngroup access to school property were secondary to primary effect of providing neutral\nforum for exchange of ideas).\n\n       Although a district may not modify its curriculum to conform to a set of sectarian\nbeliefs, see Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. at 593; Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S.\nat 106; Pratt, 670 F.2d at 776-79 (removal of film from curriculum), nothing of the sort\nhas happened here. As evidenced by the material submitted to the district court, the\ndistrict’s curriculum has not been altered in any way at the Vesta school, and the same\ncurriculum is taught at Vesta as at the Wabasso school. While technology was not\ninitially provided at the Vesta school, and students not exempted from it would have\nbeen bussed to Wabasso to receive it, the record shows that technology is now\navailable at the Vesta school. Thus, contrary to the district court’s finding, technology\nhas never been unavailable to students at the Vesta school. In sum, the curriculum--\nwhether the substantive curriculum or the availability of technology--has not been\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fmodified or changed in any way at the Vesta school from what is taught at the Wabasso\nschool.\n\n        The district granted the parental requests for exemption from technology\npursuant to Minn. Stat. Ann. § 126.699 and district policy. Granting the parental\nrequests made pursuant to the statute and the policy served the secular purpose of\nfacilitating the secular education of children at the Vesta school. Even if the district’s\ndecision to honor the requests for exemption was motivated by a desire to\naccommodate the Brethren parents’ religious beliefs, such accommodation constitutes\na legitimate secular purpose so long as “the relevant governmental decisionmaker . . .\n[does not] abandon[] neutrality and act[] with the intent of promoting a particular point\nof view in religious matters.” See Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334-35 (1987); see also\nLynch, 465 U.S. at 673 (“Nor does the Constitution require complete separation of\nchurch and state; it affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all\nreligions, and forbids hostility toward any.”). The record shows that the district honors\nall parental exemption requests, regardless of motivation.\n\n        The district’s actions in granting the parental requests for exemption did not have\nthe primary effect of advancing religion. “A law is not unconstitutional simply because\nit allows churches to advance religion . . . . For a law to have forbidden “effects” under\nLemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through\nits own activities and influence.” Amos, 483 U.S. at 337. Although the religious\nbeliefs of the Brethren parents were accommodated by the granting of their requests\nfor exemptions, the district itself did not advance religion by honoring those requests.\nSee id. at 336-37 (any advancement of religion as a result of exemption for religious\ngroups in Civil Rights Act of 1964 could not be “fairly attributed” to the government).\n        We conclude that the district’s application of state law and district policy to\ngrant parental requests for exemption will not result in any excessive entanglement.\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fBecause the record shows that the district grants all parental exemption requests and\nroutinely provides alternative instruction, its policy actually “promotes less, rather than\nmore,” involvement with religion because the district avoids considering parents’\nmotivations--including religious motivations--for requesting exemptions. See Clayton,\n884 F.2d at 379; Good News/Good Sports Club, 28 F.3d at 1510 (no excessive\nentanglement where, in applying open-access school use policy, school would not have\nto distinguish among types of groups wanting to use school). The teachers have altered\ntheir teaching methods only to the extent necessary to accommodate the parental\nexemption requests, as they would any exemption request. See Agostini, 1997 WL\n338583, at *20 (“Entanglement must be ‘excessive’ before it runs afoul of the\nEstablishment Clause.”); Wolman, 433 U.S. at 248 (“It can hardly be said that the\nsupervision of public employees performing public functions on public property creates\nan excessive entanglement between church and state.”); cf. Mueller, 463 U.S. at 403\n(no excessive entanglement from requirement that state officials examine textbooks to\ndetermine if they qualify for tax deduction so that deductions for sectarian books could\nbe disallowed).\n\n       In conclusion, neither the decision to open the Vesta school nor the district’s\napplication of the exemption policies violates the Lemon test. Both actions had a\nsecular purpose and did not have the primary effect of advancing religion or endorsing\nthe Brethren’s religious beliefs. Cf. Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at *21.\n\n\n                                            B.\n\n       Stark and Neely argue that the present case involves a situation that is\nindistinguishable from that in Board of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v.\nGrumet, 512 U.S. 687 (1994). In that case, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional\na special state statute which created a school district for a village defined exclusively\nalong religious lines. See id., 512 U.S. at 693. The “fundamental source of\nconstitutional concern” in Kiryas Joel was that the legislature had not exercised its\n\n                                           -13-\n\fpower in a manner neutral to religion. See id. at 703. The Court was concerned that\n“[b]ecause the religious community of Kiryas Joel did not receive its new governmental\nauthority simply as one of many communities eligible for equal treatment under a\ngeneral law, we have no assurance that the next similarly situated group seeking a\nschool district of its own will receive one.” Id. (footnote omitted). This lack of\nneutrality forced the Court to conclude that the creation of the school district violated\nthe Establishment Clause. See id. at 704-05. Further, the legislation could not be\nsaved by viewing it as an accommodation of religion because the “proposed\naccommodation singles out a particular religious sect for special treatment,” violating\nthe principle of “neutrality as among religions.” Id. at 706-07.\n\n         This case is not Kiryas Joel. As we discussed earlier, the record does not\nsupport Stark’s and Neely’s contention that the district has taken special actions to\nwrongly benefit the Brethren, and the fact that the district’s actions coincide with the\ndesires of certain parents does not mean that the Establishment Clause has been\nviolated. See Clayton by Clayton, 884 F.2d at 380.7 The district here decided, for\nsecular reasons, to open a public school in a building in which a public school had\npreviously been located, a school that is open to all students regardless of religious\naffiliation. The district grants the requests of all parents for exemptions regardless of\nreligious affiliation.\n\n        The extension of a benefit through the neutral application of state law and the\ndistrict’s policy to allow parental requests for exemption from curriculum--even if those\nrequests are motivated by the religious reasons of the parents and the honoring of the\nrequests accommodates those religious beliefs--does not violate the Establishment\nClause. The Supreme Court has said:\n\n\n      7\n        There has been no delegation of political power to the Brethren community in\nthis case. Cf. Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S. at 697-702 (plurality opinion) (delegation of\npolitical power to group chosen by religious criteria).\n\n                                          -14-\n\f-15-\n\f       A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor in upholding\n       governmental programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack is their\n       neutrality towards religion. . . . We have held that the guarantee of\n       neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following\n       neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients\n       whose idealogies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and\n       diverse.\n\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 2521\n(1995); see also Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at *18 (“[W]here the aid is allocated on\nthe basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made\navailable to religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis . . . the aid\nis less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.”).\n\n       The state action in this case is well within the boundaries set by cases in which\nthe Supreme Court has upheld “government programs that neutrally provide benefits\nto a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion.” Zobrest v. Catalina\nFoothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 8 (1993). See, e.g., Rosenberger, 115 S. Ct. at 2521-\n25 (neutral program paying for printing of student publications); Zobrest, 509 U.S. at\n10-14 (sign-language interpreter for deaf student at Catholic high school); Witters v.\nWashington Dep’t of Servs. for the Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 486-89 (1986) (vocational\nassistance for blind person studying for religious vocation at Christian college);\nMueller, 463 U.S. at 396-99 (tax deduction for educational expenses); Widmar v.\nVincent, 454 U.S. 263, 273-75 (1981) (open access to university facilities); Wolman,\n433 U.S. at 237-48 (textbooks, testing, diagnostic and therapeutic services); Board of\nEduc. of Central Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 243-44 (1968) (textbooks);\nEverson, 330 U.S. at 17 (bussing reimbursement). Indeed, by granting exemptions\nwithout regard to parental motivations, the district has adhered to the principle that “[a]\nproper respect for both the Free Exercise and the Establishment Clauses compels the\nState to pursue a course of neutrality toward religion, favoring neither one religion\n\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fover others nor religious adherents collectively over nonadherents.” Kiryas Joel, 512\nU.S. at 696 (quotation omitted).\n\n       To the extent that the district’s application of the state law and district policy to\ngrant the parental requests for exemption can be viewed as accommodating religion by\nremoving a burden from the Brethren families (forcing their children to use technology),\nsuch action does not offend the Establishment Clause. “[T]he Constitution [does not]\nrequire complete separation of church and state; it affirmatively mandates\naccommodation.” Lynch, 465 U.S. at 673. The Establishment Clause is not violated\nwhen the government accommodates religious beliefs “by relieving people from\ngenerally applicable rules that interfere with their religious callings.” Lee v. Weisman,\n505 U.S. 577, 627 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring); id. at 628 (“accommodating religion\nreveals nothing beyond a recognition that general rules can unnecessarily offend the\nreligious conscience when they offend the conscience of secular society not at all”);\nAmos, 483 U.S. at 334 (“This Court has long recognized that the government may (and\nsometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without\nviolating the Establishment Clause.” (quoted case omitted)). The district’s actions in\nthis case follow our best traditions of the accommodation of religious beliefs in the\nschool context. See, e.g., Yoder, 406 U.S. at 234; Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306,\n312-15 (1952); West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642\n(1943).\n\n\n                                            C.\n\n      Finally, we examine the district’s actions under the “endorsement test.” See\nKiryas Joel, 512 U.S. at 720 (“Experience proves that the Establishment Clause . . .\ncannot easily be reduced to a single test.”) (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment). The Supreme Court has “paid particularly close attention\nto whether the challenged governmental practice either has the purpose or effect of\n‘endorsing’ religion, a concern that has long had a place in our Establishment Clause\n\n                                           -17-\n\fjurisprudence.” County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union Greater\nPittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 592 (1989). The endorsement test has been thus\nexplained:\n\n      [T]he Establishment Clause “prohibits government from making\n      adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person’s standing in the\n      political community.” The government violates this prohibition if it\n      endorses or disapproves of religion. “Endorsement sends a message to\n      nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political\n      community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are\n      insiders, favored members of the political community.”\n\nId. at 625 (O’Connor, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (quoting\nLynch, 465 U.S. at 687-88 (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n       As we have discussed, the district has acted neutrally in this case towards the\ncitizens of the district regarding the decision to open the school in Vesta and in\napplying the exemption policy. Thus, the district has not made anyone’s adherence to\nreligion relevant to their standing in the community and consequently has not endorsed\nreligion or a set of religious beliefs.\n\n      In sum, the district’s actions in this case have not violated the Establishment\nClause.\n\n                              Minnesota Constitution\n\n      We must also consider how the district’s actions fare under the Minnesota\nConstitution, for the “limitations contained in the Minnesota Constitution are\nsubstantially more restrictive than those imposed by U.S. Const. Amend. I.”\nAmericans United Inc. v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 622, 179 N.W.2d 146, 155\n(Minn. 1970). The district court did not separately analyze the state constitutional\n\n                                        -18-\n\fissue, but declared that because the district’s actions violated the federal constitution\nthey also violated the state constitution. The issue was briefed on appeal, however, and\nwe exercise our discretion to resolve it because it can be decided as a matter of law.\nSee Hutchins v. Champion Int’l Corp., 110 F.3d 1341, 1345 (8th Cir. 1997) (citing\nTalley v. United States Postal Serv., 720 F.2d 505, 508 (8th Cir. 1983)).\n\n        The Minnesota constitutional provisions preventing the establishment of religion\nprovide in relevant part that “nor shall any money be drawn from the treasury for the\nbenefit of any religious societies or religious or theological seminaries,” Minn. Const.\nArt. I, § 16, and that “[i]n no case shall any public money or property be appropriated\nor used for the support of schools wherein the distinctive doctrines, creeds or tenets of\nany particular Christian or other religious sect are promulgated or taught.” Minn.\nConst. Art. XIII, § 2. The “fundamental concept” is “that the state may neither\nadvance nor inhibit religion, which . . . defines permissible limits of legislation under\nstate . . . law.” Americans United, 179 N.W.2d at 157. The “establishment clauses\nprohibit both ‘benefits’ and ‘support’ to schools teaching distinctive religious\ndoctrines.” Minnesota Fed’n of Teachers v. Mammenga, 500 N.W.2d 136, 138 (Minn.\nCt. App. 1993).\n\n       As shown above, no religious instruction takes place at the Vesta school, and\nthere is no expenditure of public funds in support of the teaching or promulgating of\nreligious beliefs. Accordingly, we conclude that no violation of the state constitution\nhas occurred.\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n       The injunction is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court with\ndirections to dismiss the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fMURPHY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n        Because I believe that the establishment by the public school district of this\nspecial school in Vesta for children of the Brethren goes beyond what is permitted by\nthe first amendment to the United States Constitution, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The district entered into a contractual arrangement with the religious group\nknown as the Brethren to operate a special public school in Vesta tailored to meet the\ngroup's religious concerns. Before 1984 the district operated two elementary schools:\none in Wabasso and one fourteen miles away in Vesta. After the school in Vesta was\nclosed for economic reasons, children of the Brethren either attended the regular public\nelementary school in Wabasso or were homeschooled. Various accommodations were\nmade at Wabasso to respect the religious beliefs of the Brethren, such as providing\nseparate tables for their children at lunch and excusing them from activities that\ninvolved technological devices. Their opposition to the use of technology includes any\nuse of television, radio, audio and video recordings, computers, or movies.\n\n       During 1992-93, the Brethren proposed a joint venture with the school district\nto reopen the elementary school in Vesta and this proposal was approved at a meeting\nof the school board in February 1993. The minutes of the meeting and\ncontemporaneous newspaper accounts indicate that the school was identified with the\nBrethren. One such news story stated in part:\n\n            The Wabasso Board of Education has reached an agreement with\n      the Vesta Brethren to proceed with plans for a K-6 elementary school at\n      Vesta this fall.\n\n       ....\n\n            If it is legally possible to establish this school, it would be operated\n      without the assistance of modern technology such as computers, and\n\n                                          -20-\n\f       video and audio equipment. The reasoning behind this is that the\n       Brethren’s religious beliefs prohibit them from using such items, and this\n       has created a conflict in trying to send their children to the public school\n       in Wabasso, which uses such teaching tools and methods.\n\n             To eliminate the need to remove these children from the public\n       school environment and teach them at home, the Brethren made the\n       proposal for a second school in Vesta last year.\n\nVicki L. Gerdes, \"Agreement is Reached on Proposed School in Vesta,\" Redwood\nGazette, June 17, 1993.\n\n       On October 12, 1993, the Brethren, the school district, and Lloyd Paskewitz\nentered into a formal written agreement to operate a public elementary school in Vesta.8\nPaskewitz had previously purchased the Vesta school building, and the building was\nmade available under the agreement for the district to use free of charge. Paskewitz\nand the Brethren also agreed to be responsible for all maintenance, security, taxes, and\ninsurance. In return the district would provide a teacher and educational materials and\nlimit the use of technology. Section 6 of the Agreement provides:\n\n       The School District shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law and\n       rules and regulations adopted by the School Board of the School District,\n       limit the use of technology such as television, radio, audio and/or video\n       recordings, computers and movies in the classrooms at the school\n       provided for herein.\n\nSections 8 and 9 indicate that the district envisioned a different set of academic\nofferings at the Vesta school than at the public school in Wabasso. These sections\n\n       8\n         The majority finds \"little significance\" in the fact that the Brethren were party\nto the lease, but the group's inclusion is significant in light of the district's claim that it\ndid not take into account the religious background or beliefs of those who requested\nexemptions from the standard curricula.\n\n                                             -21-\n\freserve to the district the right to provide special education, health, music, physical\neducation classes, and hot lunches at the Wabasso elementary school for any students\nat Vesta who might want to participate in these normally available programs which\nwould not be offered at Vesta because of the preferences of the Brethren.\n\n       The Brethren were actively involved in other ways in the reopening of the Vesta\nschool. Lloyd Paskewitz and several other members of the Brethren participated in the\ninterviews conducted to select a teacher for the new school. It is undisputed that it was\nunprecedented to have non-district employees present at such interviews. On June 1,\n1993, Lloyd Paskewitz provided Superintendent Bates with a list of 19 children who\nplanned to attend the school in Vesta, and only these children eventually enrolled in the\nschool.\n\n       There are significant differences between the curricula offered at Vesta and\nWabasso. Although the official curricula adopted for the Vesta school calls for at least\none half hour of computer lab each week and district officials claim computer\ntechnology is available at Vesta, computer training has never been offered. Other\nforms of technology to which the Brethren object, such as television, video players, and\nfilms, have not been used at Vesta, although they are regularly used at Wabasso. The\nhealth offerings at Vesta are also not the same as those offered at Wabasso. The drug\nawareness education programs used in the Wabasso school for kindergarten through\nsixth grade are not available at Vesta. Although the official curricula at Vesta requires\none half hour of physical education each day “with specialists,” it is presented in an\nunstructured manner by a parent volunteer who has no formal training in physical\neducation. At Wabasso it is taught in a structured manner by a physical education\nteacher. The Vesta curricula officially requires at least an hour of musical instruction\neach week, but the record does not indicate that music is actually offered. If a child at\nthe Vesta school wants such standard curricula offerings, he or she must make a special\nrequest and then commute thirty miles in the middle of the school day to Wabasso for\nhealth, physical education, or music classes.\n\n                                          -22-\n\f        The facts of this case show an abandonment of the principle of state neutrality\nin religious matters which underlies establishment clause jurisprudence. See Board of\nEduc. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, 114 S. Ct. 2481, 2487 (1994). The\nfirst amendment prohibits the state from favoring one religion over another or from\nfavoring religious adherents collectively over non-adherents. Id. (citing Epperson v.\nArkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968)). Religious neutrality is particularly important in\nthe context of elementary and secondary schools, where the students are impressionable\nand attendance is involuntary. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583-84 (1987).\nWhile the Supreme Court \"has long recognized that the government may (and\nsometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without\nviolating the Establishment Clause,” Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334 (1987)\n(citations and quotations omitted), “accommodation is not a principle without limits,”\nand at some point accommodation may devolve into an unlawful fostering of religion.\nKiryas Joel, 114 S. Ct. at 2492; Amos, 483 U.S. at 334. An asserted motivation of\nreligious accommodation, even if justified by reference to a state statute, cannot shield\ngovernmental actions that otherwise violate the principle of neutrality embedded in the\nestablishment clause. See Kiryas Joel, 114 S. Ct. at 2493.9\n\n       Here the school district has done far more than grant individual exemptions to\naspects of the public school curricula under state law, for it has entered into a\ncontractual relationship with members of a religious group to tailor a school to their\npreferences. The district has agreed to limit the use of technology not for pedagogical\nreasons, but to match the tenets of a single religious group. It also modified the health,\nmusic, physical education, and computer curricula normally offered. The district has\nacted to create a school where a student interested in participating in the standard\n\n      9\n      The district's decision to reopen the school by entering into a special written\nagreement with a religious group could not have been motivated by statutory duties\nbecause the district approved the proposal from the Brethren to reopen the school in\nFebruary 1993 and Minn. Stat. § 126.699 (1996) was not passed until May 1993.\n\n                                          -23-\n\fhealth, physical education, music, or computer offerings must make a special request\nand/or commute almost thirty miles during the school day to obtain such regular\neducational services at Wabasso. It is not surprising that non-Brethren children have\nnot enrolled at Vesta.\n\n        This case is similar to Kiryas Joel where the Supreme Court found that the\ncreation of a school district based on the religious affiliation of the community members\nwas unconstitutional because it impermissibly singled out a particular religious group\nfor special treatment. 114 S. Ct. at 2491. The village of Kiryas Joel had been\nestablished as an enclave for a particular sect of Hasidic Jews called the Satmars who,\nlike the Brethren, eschewed much of the modern world and maintained a very isolated\ncommunity. The Satmar children were normally educated in private religious schools\nin the village, but these parochial schools did not provide services for handicapped\nstudents as required by state law. The New York legislature created a special school\ndistrict that conformed to the boundaries of the village so that services for handicapped\nchildren could be provided in a way acceptable to the Satmars. Since the community\nof Kiryas Joel did not receive its benefit \"simply as one of many communities eligible\nfor equal treatment under a general law,\" there was no guarantee that the next religious\ncommunity desiring its own school district would be given one and the arrangement\nwas unconstitutional. Id.\n\n        Like the legislature in Kiryas Joel, the school district has singled out a particular\nreligious group for benefits by setting up a school the Brethren find acceptable in order\nto retain their participation in the public school system. There is no guarantee that the\nnext religious group in the district (or elsewhere in the state) could obtain a special\nschool for its members supported with a publicly funded teacher teaching a modified\ncurricula in accordance with their religious beliefs. The establishment of the school in\nVesta thus violates the principle of neutrality and \"crosses the line from permissible\naccommodation to impermissible establishment.\" Id.\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\f        The district argues it reopened the Vesta school to provide a better public\neducation by transporting fewer students from Vesta to Wabasso, reducing the class\nsize in Wabasso, and by lessening a space shortage there as well, but these purposes\ncould have been carried out by reopening the Vesta school as it had operated before\nwithout a special signed agreement with the Brethren. The only reason the Brethren\nare involved is that the district presumably could not afford to reopen the Vesta school\nwithout the financial assistance they provided directly in the agreement and indirectly\nby enrolling their children in the public school system. Even if the district was\nmotivated by improving the overall quality of education in its area, it established a\nschool in which the curricula conformed to the religious objections of the Brethren in\nexchange for financial assistance. This is not an acceptable secular purpose. See\nEpperson, 393 U.S. at 106 (“There is and can be no doubt that the First Amendment\ndoes not permit the State to require that teaching and learning must be tailored to the\nprinciples or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma.”); Edwards, 482 U.S. at 593\n(striking down Louisiana’s Creationism act because the “purpose of the . . . Act was\nto restructure the science curriculum to conform with a particular religious viewpoint”);\nPratt v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. 831, 670 F.2d 771 (8th Cir. 1982) (removing a film\nfrom a school curriculum based on religious objections violated the Establishment\nClause).\n\n       An impermissible effect of governmental action is one that endorses or promotes\nreligion. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592-\n601 (1989); Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 17 (1989). Whether the\nprimary effect is the impermissible endorsement of religion can be measured by what\nreasonable observers, including non-adherents, would conclude. Allegheny, 492 U.S.\nat 595, 627-32 (plurality opinion). As the district court pointed out, the way in which\nthe school was reopened and operated created a perception in the community that the\nschool was really just for the children of the Brethren even though it was theoretically\nopen to all students. The effect of establishing the school was thus an endorsement of\nthe Brethren’s beliefs.\n\n                                          -25-\n\f        The majority relies on Clayton by Clayton v. Place, 884 F.2d 376 (8th Cir.\n1989), for the idea that state action which coincidentally mirrors certain religious\nbeliefs does not have the effect of promoting religion. Clayton upheld a rule prohibiting\ndances at public schools where there was no evidence in the record to indicate why the\nrule had been passed. Id. at 378, 380. In contrast, the actions of the district regarding\nthe school in Vesta did not simply coincide with the beliefs of the Brethren. The record\nreflects direct involvement of the Brethren in organizing and financing the school. Mr.\nPaskewitz’s letter, the meetings of the school board, and the formal written agreement\nbetween the district and the Brethren, all indicate that but for the religious concerns and\nfinancial support of the Brethren, the school in Vesta would never have been reopened\nor operated in the current manner. Here there is far more than mere coincidence\nbetween the modifications of the Vesta school program and the beliefs of the Brethren.\n        The district contends the Vesta school does not advance religion because it is\nopen to all students and the same curricula available at Wabasso is available to Vesta\nstudents willing to bus to Wabasso for specific classes, but it is appropriate to look\nbeyond the theory to examine the practical reality of the situation. See Kiryas Joel, 114\nS. Ct. at 2488-89 (looking at effect of statute, not its form); Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S.\n577, 593, 595 (1992) (\"subtle and indirect\" pressure to participate in religious\nceremony can be as real as overt compulsion; \"law reaches past formalism\"); Edwards,\n482 U.S. at 586-87 (“While the Court is normally deferential to a State’s articulation\nof a secular purpose, it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not\na sham.”). The contemporaneous newspaper accounts indicate the Vesta school is\nconsidered by both Brethren and non-Brethren citizens to be a school for the Brethren\nchildren. The Vesta school creates the perception that the state has singled out the\nBrethren for special, preferential treatment by modifying the standard curricula to fit\ntheir religious objections. Such treatment has the primary effect of creating a state\nendorsement of the religious views of the Brethren, Edwards, 482 U.S. at 593\n(“preference” for particular religious beliefs constitutes an endorsement of religion),\nand cannot be reconciled with the establishment clause cases which require the\n\n\n                                           -26-\n\fgovernment to adopt a neutral position toward religion. See, e.g., Kiryas Joel, 114 S.\nCt. at 2487; Wallace v. Jaffee, 472 U.S. 38, 52-54; Epperson, 393 U.S. at 104.\n\n       Three primary criteria are helpful in considering whether state action has the\neffect of advancing religion: whether it results in government indoctrination of religious\nbeliefs, whether it defines the aid recipients by reference to religion, and whether it\ncreates an excessive entanglement between the state and religion. Agostini v. Felton,\nNos. 96-552, 96-553, 1997 WL 338583 (U.S. June 23, 1997) at *21. Applying these\nfactors to the facts of this case, the actions of the district have the impermissible effect\nof advancing religion.\n\n        Aid that furthers the educational function of religious schools is no longer\npresumed to be invalid per se, Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at *15, but state action may\nimpermissibly indoctrinate religious beliefs when it provides direct aid to religious\ninstitutions or when it relieves sectarian institutions of costs they otherwise would bear.\nId. at *17; see also Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 12 (1993).\nAlthough the Vesta school is theoretically open to the public, the district's actions are\nsuspect because they relieve the Brethren of costs they would have otherwise borne in\nhomeschooling or establishing their own school. If this arrangement were upheld, it\nwould no longer be necessary for Catholic, Lutheran, Jewish, or Muslim communities\nto expend the resources required to establish separate parochial schools. They could\nalso offer a district free rent in a building they own in exchange for a teacher and\nteaching materials and obtain a religiously homogeneous school with basic educational\ninstruction to their liking. This is the type of direct subsidization that has the effect of\nadvancing religion. Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at *17; Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S.\n349, 365-66 (1975) (lending instructional materials and equipment to sectarian schools\nhas the effect of advancing religion).\n\n      Aid provided to all eligible children on the basis of neutral, secular criteria\nregardless of where they attend school is permissible because it does not define\n\n                                           -27-\n\frecipients on the basis of religion and does not provide incentives for recipients to\nmodify there religious beliefs. Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at *18-19; see also Widmar\nv. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274 (1981) . In contrast, the effect of the Vesta operation\nis to provide a benefit for the Brethren which it does not provide for non-Brethren. The\nBrethren children can now obtain a publicly financed education in Vesta that conforms\nwith their particular religious beliefs, while non-Brethren children, either with or\nwithout the reopened Vesta school, must still commute to Wabasso if they want to\nreceive all of the curricula regularly offered by the district. The actions of the district\nviolate the establishment clause because they have the effect of singling out the\nBrethren for a special benefit.\n\n       State aid or action will also advance religion if it leads to an excessive\nentanglement between church and state.10 The test for an impermissible entanglement\nexamines the character and purposes of the institutions benefitted, the nature of the aid\nprovided, and the resulting relationship between the government and the religious\nauthority. Agostini, 1997 WL 338583, at *19 (quoting Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.\n602, 615 (1971)). Here, the district has entered into a contractual relationship with a\nreligious group for mutual benefit, essentially forming a partnership between the\nBrethren and the district to open and operate the Vesta school with a curricula\nacceptable to the religious group.\n\n       There are many competing values in our richly diverse society, and the religion\nclauses of the first amendment protect the rights of all to practice the religion of their\nchoice and also prevent the government from preferential advancement of any one\nreligious group. Because the school district's establishment of the special school at\nVesta crosses over the line permitted under the Constitution, I dissent.\n\n\n\n      10\n       Agostini states that previous cases have essentially collapsed the \"effect\" and\n\"entanglement\" prongs of the Lemon test.

It covers approximately 225 square miles of\nagricultural land, including the towns of Wabasso and Vesta. The district operated\nelementary schools in both Wabasso and Vesta until the 1983-84 school year. It closed\nthe Vesta elementary school and sold the building in May 1984. Thereafter, the Vesta\nchildren attended the Wabasso school, which is approximately fourteen miles from\nVesta.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f       Lloyd Paskewitz bought the old Vesta elementary school building in 1991.\nPaskewitz and several other Vesta families are members of a religious group known as\nthe Brethren, a group that originated in Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s.1 See Bryan\nRonald Wilson, “The Brethren” A Recent Sociological Study (1981). (Appellees’ App.\nEx. W.) It is undisputed that the Brethren have a sincerely held religious belief in\navoiding the use of technology, including televisions, radios, videos, films, and\ncomputers.\n\n       In August 1992, Paskewitz, on behalf of several of the Vesta Brethren families,\nwrote to Dr. George Bates, the district’s superintendent, about the possibility of\nreopening the Vesta elementary school in the form of a multi-age classroom. Paskewitz\noffered to lease space in the old school to the district in consideration of the district’s\nproviding a teacher and supplies. Paskewitz’s letter stated, “[w]e would have no\nobjection to it being a public school,” but requested that “the charter of the school in\nVesta” contain a clause stating “[t]hat no T.V., Radios, Videos, and Computers be\nused.” Paskewitz stated that there were approximately twenty-one Brethren children\nthat would be interested in attending and that the group had heard that other, non-\nBrethren children might be interested in attending the Vesta school. Paskewitz’s letter\nalso noted that the Brethren children would not require transportation or school\nlunches, as the children could walk to school and would go home for lunch in\naccordance with their religious beliefs.\n\n       Dr. Bates attested that he considered the feasibility of opening a multi-age\nclassroom in Vesta. He stated that the primary benefits of such a classroom included\nthe reduction in the number of students being bussed to Wabasso, the availability of an\nadditional multi-age classroom, the reduction in class sizes in grade-specific\nclassrooms, and the alleviation of space shortage in the Wabasso building. He noted\n\n\n      1\n      Paskewitz estimated that approximately 115 of the 300 people living in Vesta\nare members of the Brethren.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fthat the relative costs of the proposed classroom were minimal. After holding public\nmeetings, the school board unanimously approved the proposal. Members of the\nschool board attested that they approved the opening of the Vesta school for several\nreasons, most of which were financial. Opening the Vesta school would prevent the\nBrethren children from possibly being home-schooled, which would have meant a loss\nin state aid of roughly $3,200 for each student withdrawn from school. A Vesta school\neliminated the need to bus Vesta students to Wabasso, and it was more economical to\nsend one teacher to Vesta than to bus Vesta children to Wabasso. Additionally,\nopening a multi-age classroom in Vesta would provide educational benefits for those\nstudents who otherwise might have been home-schooled. Dr. Bates and the school\nboard members attested that during the approval process they did not discuss the\nreligious backgrounds of the parents or students who might attend the Vesta school, nor\nwere those religious backgrounds relevant to their decision.\n\n       A three-year lease was signed on October 12, 1993, by the district, Paskewitz,\nand the Brethren.2 The lease provided that the Vesta school would be operated by the\ndistrict in the form of a multi-age classroom and would be “a public school for any\nresident student in the School District.” The district would provide teachers and\nadministrative services, establish the curriculum “in compliance with state laws and\nrules,” and provide classroom materials for instruction. The parents of the Brethren\nchildren would “have the right to comment on and provide input regarding” classroom\nmaterials “to the same extent as other parents in the School District,” but the district\nretained “the sole discretion” regarding “final approval” of textbooks and instructional\nmaterials. The lease provided that “[t]he School District shall, to the extent permitted\nunder applicable law and rules and regulations . . . limit the use of technology such as\n\n      2\n        Although the “Brethern” [sic] was an additional party to the lease, the person\nwho signed the lease allegedly on the Brethren’s behalf has attested that he had no\nauthority to do so. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that the Brethren\nhad any ownership interest in the Vesta school building. Thus, we find little\nsignificance in the fact that they are a party to the lease.\n\n                                          -4-\n\ftelevision, radio, audio and/or video recordings, computers and movies in the\nclassrooms at the school.” The district would provide special education, certain\nfederally funded educational services, and counseling services, as well as instruction\nin health, physical education, and music at the Wabasso School to any Vesta students\nneeding them.3 The lease stated that “[a]ll policies adopted by the [School District] . . .\nshall apply at the [Vesta] school.” Paskewitz and the Brethren agreed to pay all\nutilities, provide custodial services, repair and maintain the building and grounds, pay\nproperty taxes, provide property and liability insurance related to the building, and\nremove snow.\n\n       The district planned to operate three multi-age classrooms during the 1993-94\nschool year, two in Wabasso and one in Vesta. The district solicited students for these\nclassrooms, and fifty-four students signed up and were allowed to request which school\nthey wished to attend. Thirty-five chose the Wabasso school, and the remaining\nnineteen chose the Vesta school. Eleven parents of twenty-nine current or former\nVesta students attested that they preferred sending their children to the Vesta school\nrather than the Wabasso school because they liked the convenience of having their\nchildren attend a school within walking distance and having their children come home\nfor lunch. They also preferred the multi-age Vesta classroom to a grade-specific one\nin Wabasso.4 Although the Vesta school is open to any student in the district who\nwishes to attend there, apparently only Brethren children have attended the Vesta\nschool since it opened.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n        The lease stated that hot lunch would also be provided at the Wabasso school,\nbut the district has said that it would cater hot lunches to students at the Vesta school\nif needed.\n        4\n        The multi-age classrooms in Wabasso were open only for the 1993-94 school\nyear.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        Dr. Bates and the two Vesta teachers attested that the same elementary\ncurriculum is taught at the Vesta school as is taught at the Wabasso school.\nTechnology, in the form of computer instruction, is a standard part of that curriculum\nfor each grade level. The teachers testified that when the Vesta school first opened,\nstudents wishing computer instruction would have been bussed to the Wabasso school\nto receive it. Both attested that the district now provides computer and audio/visual\nequipment to them at the Vesta school upon request. Although technology is available\nto all students, both teachers testified that they do not regularly use technology in their\nclassroom instruction.\n\n        Minnesota law requires school districts to establish a procedure that allows\nparents to review the content of instructional materials provided to a minor child. If the\nparent objects to that content, the district must make reasonable arrangements for\nalternative instruction. See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 126.699 (West 1994). The district’s\npolicy allows students with religious objections to be excused from objectionable\nclasses or activities. If the class or activity is a required one, “suitable alternative\nactivities shall be provided.” Dr. Bates attested that the district has received numerous\nobjections to various activities, including the use of computer technology, drug\neducation, self-esteem training, certain books and audio and visual presentations, and\nsex education; that the district does not inquire into the motivations for a parent’s\nobjections; and that the district provides alternative instruction.\n\n       All of the Brethren parents have objected to the use of computers at the Vesta\nschool and have asked for alternative instruction for their children, which has been\nprovided. Accordingly, the educational curriculum at the Vesta school does not include\nthe use of computers, videos, films, or audio presentations. While the Brethren children\nwere attending the Wabasso school prior to the reopening of the Vesta school, the\ndistrict accommodated their religious objections and allowed them to avoid\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fparticipating in the use of technology.5 It is undisputed that, in light of the\naccommodations the district would make at the Wabasso school for the Brethren\nchildren, the Brethren children have received exactly the same education at the Vesta\nschool that they would have received if they had continued to attend the Wabasso\nschool. It is also undisputed that no religious instruction has taken place at the Vesta\nschool and that no religious artifacts are present.\n\n                                 Procedural History\n\n       Matthew Stark and Marcia Neely are Minnesota citizens utilizing taxpayer\nstanding who filed suit against the district6 seeking a declaratory judgment that the\ncreation and operation of the Vesta school violates the Establishment Clause of the\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1 section 16 of the\nMinnesota Constitution. They also sought an injunction prohibiting the district from\noperating the Vesta school in conformance with Brethren beliefs, a judgment requiring\nthe district to refund to the State of Minnesota all state aid the district received for\nchildren attending the Vesta school, and an award of attorney fees.\n\n      The case was submitted to the district court on cross-motions for summary\njudgment. The court concluded that “the facts presented by this case provide a clear\nexample of state sponsorship, or the advancement of a religion which violates the\nmandates of the First Amendment.” The court concluded that the district had modified\nthe Vesta school’s curriculum “based solely on the request of a religious group.”\n\n\n\n\n      5\n     The district also supplied the Brethren children with a separate lunch table at the\nWabasso school.\n      6\n        The plaintiffs also sued members of the school board, Paskewitz, and the\nBrethren. These defendants were dismissed at various times, and their dismissals are\nnot raised on appeal.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       The district court further concluded that the primary effect of the opening of the\nVesta school was that of promoting religion; that “the opening, and the manner of\noperation of, the Vesta school lacks a secular purpose and was done to conform to the\nreligious beliefs of the Brethren”; and that the district had thus created “an\nimpermissible identification of its powers and duties with the religious beliefs of the\nBrethren.” The court entered an injunction permanently enjoining the district “from\noperating the Vesta School or any other school in conformance with the Brethren’s\nreligious objections to the use of computers and other technology and media.” The\ncourt did not rule on the refunding of state aid money or on the matter of attorney fees.\n\n      Following the district court’s denial of the district’s motion for a stay pending\nappeal, we entered an order staying the district court’s injunction. Stark and Neely\nhave moved to dissolve the stay. Stark and Neely have dismissed their refund claim,\nand their claim for attorney fees has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.\n\n                                    First Amendment\n       We begin by noting that the decision by the district to open a school and to\naccommodate parental requests for exemption from aspects of the district’s chosen\ncurriculum falls within the heartland of the “comprehensive powers and substantial\ndiscretion” that are generally afforded to school districts in “discharg[ing] the important\ntasks entrusted to them.” Pratt v.

The court noted that the Vesta school is perceived as\na Brethren school and that the district had thus “create[d] an impermissible\nidentification of its powers and duties with the religious beliefs of the Brethren.”\n\n      Quinones involved a plan to educate Hasidic Jewish girls at a public school by\nphysically separating a group of classrooms from the rest of the school and dedicating\nthem for their use, and providing only female public school teachers who would teach\nprimarily in Yiddish, with English taught as a second language. See Quinones, 803\nF.2d at 1237. The Second Circuit concluded that this plan created “a symbolic link\nbetween the state and the Hasidic sect” which appeared to endorse the separatist\nreligious views of the Hasidic Jews and that the plan thus failed the primary effect test.\nSee id. at 1241-42.\n\n      This case is distinguishable because the Vesta school does not involve the\ncomplete segregation and dedication of part or all of a public facility to a group of\nstudents for religious reasons as in Quinones. That portion of Grand Rapids on which\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fthe district court relied has now been overruled.

Further, that the school\nboard’s decision to open the Vesta school coincided with certain parents’ desire to see\na public school opened in Vesta does not compel a finding that the primary effect of the\ndecision was to advance religion or that the district was sending a message of approval\nor disapproval of individual religious choices. See Clayton by Clayton v. Place, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528516\"><a href=\"/opinion/528516/jonathan-clayton-a-minor-by-connie-clayton-his-next-friend-steve/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380 (8th Cir. 1989) (“The mere fact a governmental body takes action that\ncoincides with the . . . desires of a particular religious group . . . does not transform the\naction into an impermissible establishment of religion.”). Any incidental benefits to the\nBrethren’s religious beliefs are secondary to the primary effect of providing an\nadditional school for the secular education of Vesta children. Cf. Good News/Good\nSports Club, 28 F.3d at 1508 (incidental benefits to religion from policy of allowing\ngroup access to school property were secondary to primary effect of providing neutral\nforum for exchange of ideas).\n\n       Although a district may not modify its curriculum to conform to a set of sectarian\nbeliefs, see Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. at 593; Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S.\nat 106; Pratt, 670 F.2d at 776-79 (removal of film from curriculum), nothing of the sort\nhas happened here. As evidenced by the material submitted to the district court, the\ndistrict’s curriculum has not been altered in any way at the Vesta school, and the same\ncurriculum is taught at Vesta as at the Wabasso school. While technology was not\ninitially provided at the Vesta school, and students not exempted from it would have\nbeen bussed to Wabasso to receive it, the record shows that technology is now\navailable at the Vesta school. Thus, contrary to the district court’s finding, technology\nhas never been unavailable to students at the Vesta school. In sum, the curriculum--\nwhether the substantive curriculum or the availability of technology--has not been\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fmodified or changed in any way at the Vesta school from what is taught at the Wabasso\nschool.\n\n        The district granted the parental requests for exemption from technology\npursuant to Minn. Stat. Ann. § 126.699 and district policy. Granting the parental\nrequests made pursuant to the statute and the policy served the secular purpose of\nfacilitating the secular education of children at the Vesta school. Even if the district’s\ndecision to honor the requests for exemption was motivated by a desire to\naccommodate the Brethren parents’ religious beliefs, such accommodation constitutes\na legitimate secular purpose so long as “the relevant governmental decisionmaker . . .\n[does not] abandon[] neutrality and act[] with the intent of promoting a particular point\nof view in religious matters.” See Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.

The record shows that the district honors\nall parental exemption requests, regardless of motivation.\n\n        The district’s actions in granting the parental requests for exemption did not have\nthe primary effect of advancing religion. “A law is not unconstitutional simply because\nit allows churches to advance religion . . . . For a law to have forbidden “effects” under\nLemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through\nits own activities and influence.” Amos, 483 U.S. at 337. Although the religious\nbeliefs of the Brethren parents were accommodated by the granting of their requests\nfor exemptions, the district itself did not advance religion by honoring those requests.\nSee id. at 336-37 (any advancement of religion as a result of exemption for religious\ngroups in Civil Rights Act of 1964 could not be “fairly attributed” to the government).\n        We conclude that the district’s application of state law and district policy to\ngrant parental requests for exemption will not result in any excessive entanglement.\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fBecause the record shows that the district grants all parental exemption requests and\nroutinely provides alternative instruction, its policy actually “promotes less, rather than\nmore,” involvement with religion because the district avoids considering parents’\nmotivations--including religious motivations--for requesting exemptions. See Clayton,\n884 F.2d at 379; Good News/Good Sports Club, 28 F.3d at 1510 (no excessive\nentanglement where, in applying open-access school use policy, school would not have\nto distinguish among types of groups wanting to use school). The teachers have altered\ntheir teaching methods only to the extent necessary to accommodate the parental\nexemption requests, as they would any exemption request. See Agostini, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">338583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20 (“Entanglement must be ‘excessive’ before it runs afoul of the\nEstablishment Clause.”); Wolman, 433 U.S. at 248 (“It can hardly be said that the\nsupervision of public employees performing public functions on public property creates\nan excessive entanglement between church and state.”); cf. Mueller, 463 U.S. at 403\n(no excessive entanglement from requirement that state officials examine textbooks to\ndetermine if they qualify for tax deduction so that deductions for sectarian books could\nbe disallowed).\n\n       In conclusion, neither the decision to open the Vesta school nor the district’s\napplication of the exemption policies violates the Lemon test. Both actions had a\nsecular purpose and did not have the primary effect of advancing religion or endorsing\nthe Brethren’s religious beliefs. Cf.

In that case, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional\na special state statute which created a school district for a village defined exclusively\nalong religious lines. See id., 512 U.S. at 693. The “fundamental source of\nconstitutional concern” in Kiryas Joel was that the legislature had not exercised its\n\n                                           -13-\n\fpower in a manner neutral to religion. See id. at 703. The Court was concerned that\n“[b]ecause the religious community of Kiryas Joel did not receive its new governmental\nauthority simply as one of many communities eligible for equal treatment under a\ngeneral law, we have no assurance that the next similarly situated group seeking a\nschool district of its own will receive one.” Id. (footnote omitted). This lack of\nneutrality forced the Court to conclude that the creation of the school district violated\nthe Establishment Clause. See id. at 704-05. Further, the legislation could not be\nsaved by viewing it as an accommodation of religion because the “proposed\naccommodation singles out a particular religious sect for special treatment,” violating\nthe principle of “neutrality as among religions.” Id. at 706-07.\n\n         This case is not Kiryas Joel. As we discussed earlier, the record does not\nsupport Stark’s and Neely’s contention that the district has taken special actions to\nwrongly benefit the Brethren, and the fact that the district’s actions coincide with the\ndesires of certain parents does not mean that the Establishment Clause has been\nviolated. See Clayton by Clayton, 884 F.2d at 380.7 The district here decided, for\nsecular reasons, to open a public school in a building in which a public school had\npreviously been located, a school that is open to all students regardless of religious\naffiliation. The district grants the requests of all parents for exemptions regardless of\nreligious affiliation.\n\n        The extension of a benefit through the neutral application of state law and the\ndistrict’s policy to allow parental requests for exemption from curriculum--even if those\nrequests are motivated by the religious reasons of the parents and the honoring of the\nrequests accommodates those religious beliefs--does not violate the Establishment\nClause. The Supreme Court has said:\n\n\n      7\n        There has been no delegation of political power to the Brethren community in\nthis case. Cf. Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S. at 697-702 (plurality opinion) (delegation of\npolitical power to group chosen by religious criteria).\n\n                                          -14-\n\f-15-\n\f       A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor in upholding\n       governmental programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack is their\n       neutrality towards religion. . . . We have held that the guarantee of\n       neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following\n       neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients\n       whose idealogies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and\n       diverse.\n\nRosenberger v.

The endorsement test has been thus\nexplained:\n\n      [T]he Establishment Clause “prohibits government from making\n      adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person’s standing in the\n      political community.” The government violates this prohibition if it\n      endorses or disapproves of religion. “Endorsement sends a message to\n      nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political\n      community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are\n      insiders, favored members of the political community.”\n\nId. at 625 (O’Connor, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (quoting\nLynch, 465 U.S. at 687-88 (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n       As we have discussed, the district has acted neutrally in this case towards the\ncitizens of the district regarding the decision to open the school in Vesta and in\napplying the exemption policy. Thus, the district has not made anyone’s adherence to\nreligion relevant to their standing in the community and consequently has not endorsed\nreligion or a set of religious beliefs.\n\n      In sum, the district’s actions in this case have not violated the Establishment\nClause.\n\n                              Minnesota Constitution\n\n      We must also consider how the district’s actions fare under the Minnesota\nConstitution, for the “limitations contained in the Minnesota Constitution are\nsubstantially more restrictive than those imposed by U.S. Const.

App. 1993).\n\n       As shown above, no religious instruction takes place at the Vesta school, and\nthere is no expenditure of public funds in support of the teaching or promulgating of\nreligious beliefs. Accordingly, we conclude that no violation of the state constitution\nhas occurred.\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n       The injunction is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court with\ndirections to dismiss the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fMURPHY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n        Because I believe that the establishment by the public school district of this\nspecial school in Vesta for children of the Brethren goes beyond what is permitted by\nthe first amendment to the United States Constitution, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The district entered into a contractual arrangement with the religious group\nknown as the Brethren to operate a special public school in Vesta tailored to meet the\ngroup's religious concerns. Before 1984 the district operated two elementary schools:\none in Wabasso and one fourteen miles away in Vesta. After the school in Vesta was\nclosed for economic reasons, children of the Brethren either attended the regular public\nelementary school in Wabasso or were homeschooled. Various accommodations were\nmade at Wabasso to respect the religious beliefs of the Brethren, such as providing\nseparate tables for their children at lunch and excusing them from activities that\ninvolved technological devices. Their opposition to the use of technology includes any\nuse of television, radio, audio and video recordings, computers, or movies.\n\n       During 1992-93, the Brethren proposed a joint venture with the school district\nto reopen the elementary school in Vesta and this proposal was approved at a meeting\nof the school board in February 1993. The minutes of the meeting and\ncontemporaneous newspaper accounts indicate that the school was identified with the\nBrethren. One such news story stated in part:\n\n            The Wabasso Board of Education has reached an agreement with\n      the Vesta Brethren to proceed with plans for a K-6 elementary school at\n      Vesta this fall.\n\n       ....\n\n            If it is legally possible to establish this school, it would be operated\n      without the assistance of modern technology such as computers, and\n\n                                          -20-\n\f       video and audio equipment. The reasoning behind this is that the\n       Brethren’s religious beliefs prohibit them from using such items, and this\n       has created a conflict in trying to send their children to the public school\n       in Wabasso, which uses such teaching tools and methods.\n\n             To eliminate the need to remove these children from the public\n       school environment and teach them at home, the Brethren made the\n       proposal for a second school in Vesta last year.\n\nVicki L. Gerdes, \"Agreement is Reached on Proposed School in Vesta,\" Redwood\nGazette, June 17, 1993.\n\n       On October 12, 1993, the Brethren, the school district, and Lloyd Paskewitz\nentered into a formal written agreement to operate a public elementary school in Vesta.8\nPaskewitz had previously purchased the Vesta school building, and the building was\nmade available under the agreement for the district to use free of charge. Paskewitz\nand the Brethren also agreed to be responsible for all maintenance, security, taxes, and\ninsurance. In return the district would provide a teacher and educational materials and\nlimit the use of technology. Section 6 of the Agreement provides:\n\n       The School District shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law and\n       rules and regulations adopted by the School Board of the School District,\n       limit the use of technology such as television, radio, audio and/or video\n       recordings, computers and movies in the classrooms at the school\n       provided for herein.\n\nSections 8 and 9 indicate that the district envisioned a different set of academic\nofferings at the Vesta school than at the public school in Wabasso. These sections\n\n       8\n         The majority finds \"little significance\" in the fact that the Brethren were party\nto the lease, but the group's inclusion is significant in light of the district's claim that it\ndid not take into account the religious background or beliefs of those who requested\nexemptions from the standard curricula.\n\n                                             -21-\n\freserve to the district the right to provide special education, health, music, physical\neducation classes, and hot lunches at the Wabasso elementary school for any students\nat Vesta who might want to participate in these normally available programs which\nwould not be offered at Vesta because of the preferences of the Brethren.\n\n       The Brethren were actively involved in other ways in the reopening of the Vesta\nschool. Lloyd Paskewitz and several other members of the Brethren participated in the\ninterviews conducted to select a teacher for the new school. It is undisputed that it was\nunprecedented to have non-district employees present at such interviews. On June 1,\n1993, Lloyd Paskewitz provided Superintendent Bates with a list of 19 children who\nplanned to attend the school in Vesta, and only these children eventually enrolled in the\nschool.\n\n       There are significant differences between the curricula offered at Vesta and\nWabasso. Although the official curricula adopted for the Vesta school calls for at least\none half hour of computer lab each week and district officials claim computer\ntechnology is available at Vesta, computer training has never been offered. Other\nforms of technology to which the Brethren object, such as television, video players, and\nfilms, have not been used at Vesta, although they are regularly used at Wabasso. The\nhealth offerings at Vesta are also not the same as those offered at Wabasso. The drug\nawareness education programs used in the Wabasso school for kindergarten through\nsixth grade are not available at Vesta. Although the official curricula at Vesta requires\none half hour of physical education each day “with specialists,” it is presented in an\nunstructured manner by a parent volunteer who has no formal training in physical\neducation. At Wabasso it is taught in a structured manner by a physical education\nteacher. The Vesta curricula officially requires at least an hour of musical instruction\neach week, but the record does not indicate that music is actually offered. If a child at\nthe Vesta school wants such standard curricula offerings, he or she must make a special\nrequest and then commute thirty miles in the middle of the school day to Wabasso for\nhealth, physical education, or music classes.\n\n                                          -22-\n\f        The facts of this case show an abandonment of the principle of state neutrality\nin religious matters which underlies establishment clause jurisprudence.

An asserted motivation of\nreligious accommodation, even if justified by reference to a state statute, cannot shield\ngovernmental actions that otherwise violate the principle of neutrality embedded in the\nestablishment clause. See Kiryas Joel, 114 S. Ct. at 2493.9\n\n       Here the school district has done far more than grant individual exemptions to\naspects of the public school curricula under state law, for it has entered into a\ncontractual relationship with members of a religious group to tailor a school to their\npreferences. The district has agreed to limit the use of technology not for pedagogical\nreasons, but to match the tenets of a single religious group. It also modified the health,\nmusic, physical education, and computer curricula normally offered.

Stat. § 126.699 (1996) was not passed until May 1993.\n\n                                          -23-\n\fhealth, physical education, music, or computer offerings must make a special request\nand/or commute almost thirty miles during the school day to obtain such regular\neducational services at Wabasso. It is not surprising that non-Brethren children have\nnot enrolled at Vesta.\n\n        This case is similar to Kiryas Joel where the Supreme Court found that the\ncreation of a school district based on the religious affiliation of the community members\nwas unconstitutional because it impermissibly singled out a particular religious group\nfor special treatment. 114 S. Ct. at 2491. The village of Kiryas Joel had been\nestablished as an enclave for a particular sect of Hasidic Jews called the Satmars who,\nlike the Brethren, eschewed much of the modern world and maintained a very isolated\ncommunity. The Satmar children were normally educated in private religious schools\nin the village, but these parochial schools did not provide services for handicapped\nstudents as required by state law. The New York legislature created a special school\ndistrict that conformed to the boundaries of the village so that services for handicapped\nchildren could be provided in a way acceptable to the Satmars. Since the community\nof Kiryas Joel did not receive its benefit \"simply as one of many communities eligible\nfor equal treatment under a general law,\" there was no guarantee that the next religious\ncommunity desiring its own school district would be given one and the arrangement\nwas unconstitutional. Id.\n\n        Like the legislature in Kiryas Joel, the school district has singled out a particular\nreligious group for benefits by setting up a school the Brethren find acceptable in order\nto retain their participation in the public school system. There is no guarantee that the\nnext religious group in the district (or elsewhere in the state) could obtain a special\nschool for its members supported with a publicly funded teacher teaching a modified\ncurricula in accordance with their religious beliefs. The establishment of the school in\nVesta thus violates the principle of neutrality and \"crosses the line from permissible\naccommodation to impermissible establishment.\" Id.\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\f        The district argues it reopened the Vesta school to provide a better public\neducation by transporting fewer students from Vesta to Wabasso, reducing the class\nsize in Wabasso, and by lessening a space shortage there as well, but these purposes\ncould have been carried out by reopening the Vesta school as it had operated before\nwithout a special signed agreement with the Brethren. The only reason the Brethren\nare involved is that the district presumably could not afford to reopen the Vesta school\nwithout the financial assistance they provided directly in the agreement and indirectly\nby enrolling their children in the public school system. Even if the district was\nmotivated by improving the overall quality of education in its area, it established a\nschool in which the curricula conformed to the religious objections of the Brethren in\nexchange for financial assistance. This is not an acceptable secular purpose.

As the district court pointed out, the way in which\nthe school was reopened and operated created a perception in the community that the\nschool was really just for the children of the Brethren even though it was theoretically\nopen to all students. The effect of establishing the school was thus an endorsement of\nthe Brethren’s beliefs.\n\n                                          -25-\n\f        The majority relies on Clayton by Clayton v.

Clayton upheld a rule prohibiting\ndances at public schools where there was no evidence in the record to indicate why the\nrule had been passed. Id. at 378, 380. In contrast, the actions of the district regarding\nthe school in Vesta did not simply coincide with the beliefs of the Brethren. The record\nreflects direct involvement of the Brethren in organizing and financing the school. Mr.\nPaskewitz’s letter, the meetings of the school board, and the formal written agreement\nbetween the district and the Brethren, all indicate that but for the religious concerns and\nfinancial support of the Brethren, the school in Vesta would never have been reopened\nor operated in the current manner. Here there is far more than mere coincidence\nbetween the modifications of the Vesta school program and the beliefs of the Brethren.\n        The district contends the Vesta school does not advance religion because it is\nopen to all students and the same curricula available at Wabasso is available to Vesta\nstudents willing to bus to Wabasso for specific classes, but it is appropriate to look\nbeyond the theory to examine the practical reality of the situation.

The contemporaneous newspaper accounts indicate the Vesta school is\nconsidered by both Brethren and non-Brethren citizens to be a school for the Brethren\nchildren. The Vesta school creates the perception that the state has singled out the\nBrethren for special, preferential treatment by modifying the standard curricula to fit\ntheir religious objections.
