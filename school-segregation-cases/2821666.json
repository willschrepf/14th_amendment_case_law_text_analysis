Two sophisticated investors\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                              _____________\r<br>\r<br>            bought computer-lease  tax shelters.   The 1986  revisions to\r<br>\r<br>            the Tax  Code undercut  the economic  rationale for  such tax\r<br>\r<br>            shelters.    As  a  result,  the  seller  of  the   shelters,\r<br>\r<br>            Technology Finance  Group (\"TFG\"), later became insolvent and\r<br>\r<br>            violated  its  investment  contracts.     A  public  company,\r<br>\r<br>            Creative Resources,  Inc. (\"CRI\"),  acquired control  of TFG,\r<br>\r<br>            poured in money and attempted, unsuccessfully, to salvage the\r<br>\r<br>            company.  The two  investors, plaintiffs here, sued TFG,  its\r<br>\r<br>            new parent and two individuals, officers of the parent, inter\r                                                                    _____\r<br>\r<br>            alia,  for  TFG's breach  of  contract  on  a corporate  veil\r            ____\r<br>\r<br>            piercing theory.   The investors  obtained a jury  verdict of\r<br>\r<br>            $250,000.1  We  reverse and vacate  the verdict, finding  the\r<br>\r<br>            evidence   insufficient   to   meet   the   strict  standards\r<br>\r<br>            Massachusetts has set for piercing the corporate veil.\r<br>\r<br>            Facts\r            _____\r<br>\r<br>                      In  1986,  plaintiffs  Charles  Birbara  and  David\r<br>\r<br>            Massad  each purchased  a  one-half ownership  interest in  a\r<br>\r<br>            commercial  computer from  a  subsidiary of  TFG, a  Delaware\r<br>\r<br>            corporation that leased commercial equipment as tax shelters.\r<br>\r<br>            In addition, Massad purchased a  second computer from the TFG\r<br>\r<br>            affiliate.   These computers  were subject to  existing \"user\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            1.  With interest, this resulted  in an award of $427,945.21.\r<br>            The court  and jury rejected fraud,  conversion and deceptive\r<br>            trade practices claims  against the defendants.  TFG  has not\r<br>            appealed from the verdict against it.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            leases\"  with companies  that  had actual  possession of  the\r<br>\r<br>            computers,  as well  as to the  right of a  TFG subsidiary to\r<br>\r<br>            sell the computers when the leases expired.  TFG was required\r<br>\r<br>            to pay  plaintiffs the proceeds of these  sales, less certain\r<br>\r<br>            fees.  Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,\r<br>\r<br>            TFG  became  unable  to   market  its  equipment  leases  and\r<br>\r<br>            consequently could not  generate adequate operating  capital.\r<br>\r<br>            In an effort to return the company to firm financial footing,\r<br>\r<br>            Jerry Minsky,  TFG's then-president  and CEO,  who  is not  a\r<br>\r<br>            party  to this suit, decided that TFG would not pay investors\r<br>\r<br>            the proceeds  from the  sales of their  equipment but  rather\r<br>\r<br>            would retain  these funds,  thereby violating the  investment\r<br>\r<br>            contracts.\r<br>\r<br>                      TFG continued to face financial problems.  In 1989,\r<br>\r<br>            CRI, a  public Nevada  corporation which owned  several other\r<br>\r<br>            businesses,  acquired  complete  ownership  of  TFF, Inc.,  a\r<br>\r<br>            Delaware  corporation which  owned  all of  TFG's outstanding\r<br>\r<br>            common  stock.   CRI began  taking steps to  ameliorate TFG's\r<br>\r<br>            financial  problems.    Gordon Locke  and  Dennis Williamson,\r<br>\r<br>            members of  the CRI  Board of Directors'  Executive Committee\r<br>\r<br>            and  CRI's  only  preferred shareholders,  together  invested\r<br>\r<br>            $250,000 in CRI.   CRI, in turn, made interest  bearing loans\r<br>\r<br>            to TFG,  which were  properly documented  in the  accounts of\r<br>\r<br>            both companies.   Locke and Williamson  became executive vice\r<br>\r<br>            presidents of  TFG, for  which Williamson received  an annual\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            salary of  $206,250 and  a monthly automobile  allowance, and\r<br>\r<br>            for which Locke received  an annual salary of $187,500  and a\r<br>\r<br>            monthly  automobile allowance.    In addition,  TFG's by-laws\r<br>\r<br>            were amended to curtail the power of the CEO, Minsky.\r<br>\r<br>                      CRI  was  careful  to  observe  all  the  corporate\r<br>\r<br>            formalities  with respect  to  TFG.   The  two companies  had\r<br>\r<br>            different boards  of directors  and separate  board meetings.\r<br>\r<br>            Although, consistent with  good accounting practice, CRI  and\r<br>\r<br>            TFG  eventually had  consolidated financial  statements, each\r<br>\r<br>            kept its own financial records.\r<br>\r<br>                      The new  management  of  TFG  decided  to  continue\r<br>\r<br>            Minsky's policy of violating  contracts with TFG investors by\r<br>\r<br>            reselling  equipment  leases  without  paying  investors  the\r<br>\r<br>            proceeds, believing that this was the only way to continue to\r<br>\r<br>            improve  TFG's financial health as well  as to avoid favoring\r<br>\r<br>            investors whose equipment  had not been  sold before TFG  was\r<br>\r<br>            acquired  by CRI.   CRI,  however, did  begin the  process of\r<br>\r<br>            offering  to  all  of  the  investors  whose  contracts  were\r<br>\r<br>            violated a settlement package which included cash, notes, and\r<br>\r<br>            CRI stock.\r<br>\r<br>                      One  of  TFG's  numerous creditors  took  steps  to\r<br>\r<br>            attach a TFG  bank account in  Connecticut.  TFG  transferred\r<br>\r<br>            funds out  of this account  into a TFG account  in a Canadian\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -4-\r                                          4\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            bank in  order to meet  the payroll for TFG  employees.2  For\r<br>\r<br>            several  months in 1990, Locke  ran TFG's payroll  out of his\r<br>\r<br>            personal  attorney  operating account  in  New  York and  was\r<br>\r<br>            reimbursed  with funds  transferred out  of the  TFG Canadian\r<br>\r<br>            account.  Eventually,  in January  1991, CRI sold  TFG.   TFG\r<br>\r<br>            owed  CRI over one million dollars; this debt was forgiven at\r<br>\r<br>            the time TFG was sold.\r<br>\r<br>                      Neither of the plaintiffs in this case ever had any\r<br>\r<br>            direct  dealings  with  CRI,   Locke  or  Williamson.    Both\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs had a number of other tax shelter investments, and\r<br>\r<br>            relied on David Levinson, their financial advisor, as to this\r<br>\r<br>            investment.    Indeed, Massad  never  even  read the  initial\r<br>\r<br>            offering memorandum.   Levinson  first became aware  of TFG's\r<br>\r<br>            financial difficulties in February 1990, after calling TFG in\r<br>\r<br>            preparation  for a  meeting  with Birbara.   On  February 20,\r<br>\r<br>            Levinson spoke to Locke, who told  him that he was sure  that\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs' computers had been sold.  Although  Locke was not\r<br>\r<br>            familiar with plaintiffs' machines,  he indicated that all of\r<br>\r<br>            the  computers  had  been sold,  and  that  he  would try  to\r<br>\r<br>            determine exactly what had happened to plaintiffs' machines.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            2.  In  both of  his  depositions taken  before trial,  Locke\r<br>            testified that  it was his  best recollection that  the funds\r<br>            were transferred out of TFG's Connecticut  account into a CRI\r<br>            account in Canada.   However, at trial he testified  that his\r<br>            recollection  had been  incorrect  and bank  statements  were\r<br>            produced to substantiate his trial testimony.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -5-\r                                          5\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      Levinson conveyed this  information to  plaintiffs,\r<br>\r<br>            and in the next few days spoke to Locke or Williamson several\r<br>\r<br>            times in  an effort to find  out more.  Levinson  knew he was\r<br>\r<br>            speaking with Locke and Williamson in their capacities as TFG\r<br>\r<br>            officers  and was  not confused  about the  various corporate\r<br>\r<br>            relationships.   On  February 27,  1990, Williamson  informed\r<br>\r<br>            Levinson that  the computer  owned by plaintiffs  jointly had\r<br>\r<br>            been sold by prior  management in October 1989, and  the next\r<br>\r<br>            day, Levinson was told  that Massad's computer had also  been\r<br>\r<br>            sold in October 1989 by prior management.\r<br>\r<br>                      CRI, however, had taken control of TFG prior to the\r<br>\r<br>            sale  of the two computers,  and thus the  new management had\r<br>\r<br>            been   involved in these sales.   Moreover, the  bill of sale\r<br>\r<br>            for Massad's  computer dates  from late February  1990, after\r<br>\r<br>            Levinson's calls.  Defendants contend  that Massad's computer\r<br>\r<br>            was  actually  sold  in  November  1989  by  the  company  in\r<br>\r<br>            possession  (which  later  reimbursed  TFG),  and  that   the\r<br>\r<br>            February bill  of sale was  simply an accounting  between TFG\r<br>\r<br>            and  that other company.   Defendants assert that  this was a\r<br>\r<br>            common industry practice.  The jury would have been warranted\r<br>\r<br>            in disbelieving defendants' claim  that Massad's computer had\r<br>\r<br>            been sold in November 1989.\r<br>\r<br>                      Levinson's telephone calls prompted Locke  in early\r<br>\r<br>            March  to send  each  of the  plaintiffs the  settlement form\r<br>\r<br>            letter  on CRI  stationery  that he  was  in the  process  of\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -6-\r                                          6\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            sending out to  all TFG  investors.

At  the end of\r<br>                      June,  1989  management  changed.    This\r<br>                      Company, and  its subsidiary TFG,  is now\r<br>                      operated by new management.  We, the  new\r<br>                      management have reviewed TFG's  books and\r<br>                      records and concluded, to the best of our\r<br>                      knowledge, in relation  to the  equipment\r<br>                      owned   by   you,  that   TFG   owes  you\r<br>                      Additional Rent  .  . .  .   Regrettably,\r<br>                      over  the past 5  years, prior management\r<br>                      of TFG has not remitted sums to owners of\r<br>                      equipment   to   a   total    amount   of\r<br>                      approximately  $7  Million.   Further, we\r<br>                      concluded, upon review  of the  financial\r<br>                      statements of the Company  . . . that TFG\r<br>                      does not have the financial  resources to\r<br>                      repay these funds.\r<br>\r<br>                      . . . .\r<br>\r<br>                      Your  concern  and disappointment  at the\r<br>                      position in which you have been placed is\r<br>                      extremely understandable.  However, it is\r<br>                      most important that  you understand  that\r<br>                      the   management   responsible  for   the\r<br>                      decisions  not to  pay you  have resigned\r<br>                      and that  new management is  concerned to\r<br>                      provide  you  with  the maximum  economic\r<br>                      benefit possible under the circumstances.\r<br>\r<br>                      The jury would have  been warranted in finding that\r<br>\r<br>            the statement that former  management was responsible for the\r<br>\r<br>            sales  of  plaintiffs'  computers  was not  true.    However,\r<br>\r<br>            despite  the misrepresentation, plaintiffs  were not confused\r<br>\r<br>            about the  relationship between the  corporate entities,  nor\r<br>\r<br>            did  they take any action  in reliance on  the new management\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -7-\r                                          7\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            language  in  the letter.    Although the  majority  of TFG's\r<br>\r<br>            investors   accepted   the   standard   settlement   package,\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs declined to do so.\r<br>\r<br>            Procedural History\r            __________________\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs, who are Massachusetts  residents, filed\r<br>\r<br>            this diversity suit in the District of Massachusetts in 1990,\r<br>\r<br>            alleging breach  of contract,  common law  fraud, conversion,\r<br>\r<br>            interference  with contractual obligations,  and violation of\r<br>\r<br>            the  Massachusetts deceptive  trade practices  statute, Mass.\r<br>\r<br>            Gen.  L. ch. 93A,    2.  Aware  of TFG's precarious financial\r<br>\r<br>            condition, the plaintiffs brought  suit not only against TFG,\r<br>\r<br>            but also against CRI, Locke, and Williamson.\r<br>\r<br>                      At  the  close of  the  evidence,  the trial  judge\r<br>\r<br>            entered  a directed  verdict  against the  plaintiffs on  the\r<br>\r<br>            fraud claim concerning the computer they owned jointly.   The\r<br>\r<br>            defendants then  moved, pursuant to Rule  50(a), for judgment\r<br>\r<br>            as a matter  of law on various  grounds, including a lack  of\r<br>\r<br>            personal jurisdiction.  The district court denied the motion,\r<br>\r<br>            ruling that the personal  jurisdiction issue had been waived,\r<br>\r<br>            but  even  if  it  had not,  that  the  jury  could  find the\r<br>\r<br>            defendants had  sufficient contacts with Massachusetts  for a\r<br>\r<br>            proper exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The jury found for\r<br>\r<br>            the defendants  on the remaining fraud  and interference with\r<br>\r<br>            contractual relations  claims, but for the  plaintiffs on the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -8-\r                                          8\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            breach of contract claim.  The  trial judge reserved decision\r<br>\r<br>            on the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices claim.\r<br>\r<br>                      After  the  verdict,  defendants  again  moved  for\r<br>\r<br>            judgment as a  matter of law,  pursuant to Rule  50(b).   The\r<br>\r<br>            trial court denied  the motion.  At  the same time,  it ruled\r<br>\r<br>            that  the  defendants  had  not  violated  the  Massachusetts\r<br>\r<br>            deceptive trade practices statute,  finding that the decision\r<br>\r<br>            to  breach  the  contract  with the  plaintiffs  was  a valid\r<br>\r<br>            business judgment rather than  an attempt on the part  of the\r<br>\r<br>            defendants to line their pockets.\r<br>\r<br>            Personal Jurisdiction\r            _____________________\r<br>\r<br>                      The defendants  question whether there  is personal\r<br>\r<br>            jurisdiction  over  them  under the  Massachusetts  long  arm\r<br>\r<br>            statute, Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 233A,   3, and  the United States\r<br>\r<br>            Constitution.    The  district  court found  that  all  three\r<br>\r<br>            defendants   had  waived   their   objections   to   personal\r<br>\r<br>            jurisdiction  and that in any event, the jury could find that\r<br>\r<br>            the defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for\r<br>\r<br>            a  proper  exercise of  jurisdiction.   The  trial  judge was\r<br>\r<br>            plainly   correct   that   CRI  waived   any   objection   to\r<br>\r<br>            jurisdiction:  at  the  final pre-trial  conference,  defense\r<br>\r<br>            counsel  conceded  there  was  no jurisdictional  issue  with\r<br>\r<br>            respect  to CRI.  Because  parties are, as  a general matter,\r<br>\r<br>            bound by  the representations, concessions,  and stipulations\r<br>\r<br>            of  their attorneys,  United States  v.

Moreover, there\r<br>\r<br>            was insufficient competent evidence  of transfers of money in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -17-\r                                          17\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            the other direction, that is, from TFG to CRI.5   These loans\r<br>\r<br>            do not support the claim of confused intermingling.\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs'   argument   that  there   was  serious\r<br>\r<br>            confusion about  the manner  and  capacity in  which the  two\r<br>\r<br>            corporations and  their  representatives acted  is  similarly\r<br>\r<br>            unpersuasive.   There  is  no  evidence that  there  was  any\r<br>\r<br>            confusion  about on whose behalf a director was acting in any\r<br>\r<br>            given instance.  Locke and Williamson, in their capacities as\r<br>\r<br>            directors of both CRI and TFG, did sometimes act on behalf of\r<br>\r<br>            both corporations simultaneously, but  that is to be expected\r<br>\r<br>            when individuals serve as directors for both a parent and its\r<br>\r<br>            subsidiary.  It is also to be expected that when a subsidiary\r<br>\r<br>            company profits, the parent  company will as well.   That the\r<br>\r<br>            fortunes of CRI and TFG were  to some extent linked does not,\r<br>\r<br>            as  plaintiffs suggest,  militate  in favor  of piercing  the\r<br>\r<br>            corporate veil.\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs admitted they were not misled about  the\r<br>\r<br>            relationship  between TFG  and CRI.   Indeed, Massad  did not\r<br>\r<br>            even know that he had invested in TFG, let alone that CRI had\r<br>\r<br>            become its parent.   Plaintiffs neither knew nor  cared about\r<br>\r<br>            the relationship  between CRI and  TFG, but rather  relied on\r<br>\r<br>            their  financial  advisor,   Levinson,  who  understood   the\r<br>\r<br>            corporate relationship.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            5.

The 1986  revisions to\r<br>\r<br>            the Tax  Code undercut  the economic  rationale for  such tax\r<br>\r<br>            shelters.    As  a  result,  the  seller  of  the   shelters,\r<br>\r<br>            Technology Finance  Group (\"TFG\"), later became insolvent and\r<br>\r<br>            violated  its  investment  contracts.     A  public  company,\r<br>\r<br>            Creative Resources,  Inc. (\"CRI\"),  acquired control  of TFG,\r<br>\r<br>            poured in money and attempted, unsuccessfully, to salvage the\r<br>\r<br>            company.  The two  investors, plaintiffs here, sued TFG,  its\r<br>\r<br>            new parent and two individuals, officers of the parent, inter\r                                                                    _____\r<br>\r<br>            alia,  for  TFG's breach  of  contract  on  a corporate  veil\r            ____\r<br>\r<br>            piercing theory.   The investors  obtained a jury  verdict of\r<br>\r<br>            $250,000.1  We  reverse and vacate  the verdict, finding  the\r<br>\r<br>            evidence   insufficient   to   meet   the   strict  standards\r<br>\r<br>            Massachusetts has set for piercing the corporate veil.\r<br>\r<br>            Facts\r            _____\r<br>\r<br>                      In  1986,  plaintiffs  Charles  Birbara  and  David\r<br>\r<br>            Massad  each purchased  a  one-half ownership  interest in  a\r<br>\r<br>            commercial  computer from  a  subsidiary of  TFG, a  Delaware\r<br>\r<br>            corporation that leased commercial equipment as tax shelters.\r<br>\r<br>            In addition, Massad purchased a  second computer from the TFG\r<br>\r<br>            affiliate.   These computers  were subject to  existing \"user\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            1.  With interest, this resulted  in an award of $427,945.21.\r<br>            The court  and jury rejected fraud,  conversion and deceptive\r<br>            trade practices claims  against the defendants.  TFG  has not\r<br>            appealed from the verdict against it.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            leases\"  with companies  that  had actual  possession of  the\r<br>\r<br>            computers,  as well  as to the  right of a  TFG subsidiary to\r<br>\r<br>            sell the computers when the leases expired.  TFG was required\r<br>\r<br>            to pay  plaintiffs the proceeds of these  sales, less certain\r<br>\r<br>            fees.  Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,\r<br>\r<br>            TFG  became  unable  to   market  its  equipment  leases  and\r<br>\r<br>            consequently could not  generate adequate operating  capital.\r<br>\r<br>            In an effort to return the company to firm financial footing,\r<br>\r<br>            Jerry Minsky,  TFG's then-president  and CEO,  who  is not  a\r<br>\r<br>            party  to this suit, decided that TFG would not pay investors\r<br>\r<br>            the proceeds  from the  sales of their  equipment but  rather\r<br>\r<br>            would retain  these funds,  thereby violating the  investment\r<br>\r<br>            contracts.\r<br>\r<br>                      TFG continued to face financial problems.  In 1989,\r<br>\r<br>            CRI, a  public Nevada  corporation which owned  several other\r<br>\r<br>            businesses,  acquired  complete  ownership  of  TFF, Inc.,  a\r<br>\r<br>            Delaware  corporation which  owned  all of  TFG's outstanding\r<br>\r<br>            common  stock.   CRI began  taking steps to  ameliorate TFG's\r<br>\r<br>            financial  problems.    Gordon Locke  and  Dennis Williamson,\r<br>\r<br>            members of  the CRI  Board of Directors'  Executive Committee\r<br>\r<br>            and  CRI's  only  preferred shareholders,  together  invested\r<br>\r<br>            $250,000 in CRI.   CRI, in turn, made interest  bearing loans\r<br>\r<br>            to TFG,  which were  properly documented  in the  accounts of\r<br>\r<br>            both companies.   Locke and Williamson  became executive vice\r<br>\r<br>            presidents of  TFG, for  which Williamson received  an annual\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            salary of  $206,250 and  a monthly automobile  allowance, and\r<br>\r<br>            for which Locke received  an annual salary of $187,500  and a\r<br>\r<br>            monthly  automobile allowance.    In addition,  TFG's by-laws\r<br>\r<br>            were amended to curtail the power of the CEO, Minsky.\r<br>\r<br>                      CRI  was  careful  to  observe  all  the  corporate\r<br>\r<br>            formalities  with respect  to  TFG.   The  two companies  had\r<br>\r<br>            different boards  of directors  and separate  board meetings.\r<br>\r<br>            Although, consistent with  good accounting practice, CRI  and\r<br>\r<br>            TFG  eventually had  consolidated financial  statements, each\r<br>\r<br>            kept its own financial records.\r<br>\r<br>                      The new  management  of  TFG  decided  to  continue\r<br>\r<br>            Minsky's policy of violating  contracts with TFG investors by\r<br>\r<br>            reselling  equipment  leases  without  paying  investors  the\r<br>\r<br>            proceeds, believing that this was the only way to continue to\r<br>\r<br>            improve  TFG's financial health as well  as to avoid favoring\r<br>\r<br>            investors whose equipment  had not been  sold before TFG  was\r<br>\r<br>            acquired  by CRI.   CRI,  however, did  begin the  process of\r<br>\r<br>            offering  to  all  of  the  investors  whose  contracts  were\r<br>\r<br>            violated a settlement package which included cash, notes, and\r<br>\r<br>            CRI stock.\r<br>\r<br>                      One  of  TFG's  numerous creditors  took  steps  to\r<br>\r<br>            attach a TFG  bank account in  Connecticut.  TFG  transferred\r<br>\r<br>            funds out  of this account  into a TFG account  in a Canadian\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -4-\r                                          4\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            bank in  order to meet  the payroll for TFG  employees.2  For\r<br>\r<br>            several  months in 1990, Locke  ran TFG's payroll  out of his\r<br>\r<br>            personal  attorney  operating account  in  New  York and  was\r<br>\r<br>            reimbursed  with funds  transferred out  of the  TFG Canadian\r<br>\r<br>            account.  Eventually,  in January  1991, CRI sold  TFG.   TFG\r<br>\r<br>            owed  CRI over one million dollars; this debt was forgiven at\r<br>\r<br>            the time TFG was sold.\r<br>\r<br>                      Neither of the plaintiffs in this case ever had any\r<br>\r<br>            direct  dealings  with  CRI,   Locke  or  Williamson.    Both\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs had a number of other tax shelter investments, and\r<br>\r<br>            relied on David Levinson, their financial advisor, as to this\r<br>\r<br>            investment.    Indeed, Massad  never  even  read the  initial\r<br>\r<br>            offering memorandum.   Levinson  first became aware  of TFG's\r<br>\r<br>            financial difficulties in February 1990, after calling TFG in\r<br>\r<br>            preparation  for a  meeting  with Birbara.   On  February 20,\r<br>\r<br>            Levinson spoke to Locke, who told  him that he was sure  that\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs' computers had been sold.  Although  Locke was not\r<br>\r<br>            familiar with plaintiffs' machines,  he indicated that all of\r<br>\r<br>            the  computers  had  been sold,  and  that  he  would try  to\r<br>\r<br>            determine exactly what had happened to plaintiffs' machines.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            2.  In  both of  his  depositions taken  before trial,  Locke\r<br>            testified that  it was his  best recollection that  the funds\r<br>            were transferred out of TFG's Connecticut  account into a CRI\r<br>            account in Canada.   However, at trial he testified  that his\r<br>            recollection  had been  incorrect  and bank  statements  were\r<br>            produced to substantiate his trial testimony.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -5-\r                                          5\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      Levinson conveyed this  information to  plaintiffs,\r<br>\r<br>            and in the next few days spoke to Locke or Williamson several\r<br>\r<br>            times in  an effort to find  out more.  Levinson  knew he was\r<br>\r<br>            speaking with Locke and Williamson in their capacities as TFG\r<br>\r<br>            officers  and was  not confused  about the  various corporate\r<br>\r<br>            relationships.   On  February 27,  1990, Williamson  informed\r<br>\r<br>            Levinson that  the computer  owned by plaintiffs  jointly had\r<br>\r<br>            been sold by prior  management in October 1989, and  the next\r<br>\r<br>            day, Levinson was told  that Massad's computer had also  been\r<br>\r<br>            sold in October 1989 by prior management.\r<br>\r<br>                      CRI, however, had taken control of TFG prior to the\r<br>\r<br>            sale  of the two computers,  and thus the  new management had\r<br>\r<br>            been   involved in these sales.   Moreover, the  bill of sale\r<br>\r<br>            for Massad's  computer dates  from late February  1990, after\r<br>\r<br>            Levinson's calls.  Defendants contend  that Massad's computer\r<br>\r<br>            was  actually  sold  in  November  1989  by  the  company  in\r<br>\r<br>            possession  (which  later  reimbursed  TFG),  and  that   the\r<br>\r<br>            February bill  of sale was  simply an accounting  between TFG\r<br>\r<br>            and  that other company.   Defendants assert that  this was a\r<br>\r<br>            common industry practice.  The jury would have been warranted\r<br>\r<br>            in disbelieving defendants' claim  that Massad's computer had\r<br>\r<br>            been sold in November 1989.\r<br>\r<br>                      Levinson's telephone calls prompted Locke  in early\r<br>\r<br>            March  to send  each  of the  plaintiffs the  settlement form\r<br>\r<br>            letter  on CRI  stationery  that he  was  in the  process  of\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -6-\r                                          6\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            sending out to  all TFG  investors.  The  letter provided  in\r<br>\r<br>            relevant part:\r<br>\r<br>                      Early last year this company acquired all\r<br>                      the  stock  of Technology  Finance Group,\r<br>                      Inc. (\"TFG\") from which you purchased [an\r<br>                      interest]  in  equipment as  indicated in\r<br>                      the attached  Schedule A.  At  the end of\r<br>                      June,  1989  management  changed.    This\r<br>                      Company, and  its subsidiary TFG,  is now\r<br>                      operated by new management.  We, the  new\r<br>                      management have reviewed TFG's  books and\r<br>                      records and concluded, to the best of our\r<br>                      knowledge, in relation  to the  equipment\r<br>                      owned   by   you,  that   TFG   owes  you\r<br>                      Additional Rent  .  . .  .   Regrettably,\r<br>                      over  the past 5  years, prior management\r<br>                      of TFG has not remitted sums to owners of\r<br>                      equipment   to   a   total    amount   of\r<br>                      approximately  $7  Million.   Further, we\r<br>                      concluded, upon review  of the  financial\r<br>                      statements of the Company  . . . that TFG\r<br>                      does not have the financial  resources to\r<br>                      repay these funds.\r<br>\r<br>                      . . . .\r<br>\r<br>                      Your  concern  and disappointment  at the\r<br>                      position in which you have been placed is\r<br>                      extremely understandable.  However, it is\r<br>                      most important that  you understand  that\r<br>                      the   management   responsible  for   the\r<br>                      decisions  not to  pay you  have resigned\r<br>                      and that  new management is  concerned to\r<br>                      provide  you  with  the maximum  economic\r<br>                      benefit possible under the circumstances.\r<br>\r<br>                      The jury would have  been warranted in finding that\r<br>\r<br>            the statement that former  management was responsible for the\r<br>\r<br>            sales  of  plaintiffs'  computers  was not  true.    However,\r<br>\r<br>            despite  the misrepresentation, plaintiffs  were not confused\r<br>\r<br>            about the  relationship between the  corporate entities,  nor\r<br>\r<br>            did  they take any action  in reliance on  the new management\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -7-\r                                          7\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            language  in  the letter.    Although the  majority  of TFG's\r<br>\r<br>            investors   accepted   the   standard   settlement   package,\r<br>\r<br>            plaintiffs declined to do so.\r<br>\r<br>            Procedural History\r            __________________\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs, who are Massachusetts  residents, filed\r<br>\r<br>            this diversity suit in the District of Massachusetts in 1990,\r<br>\r<br>            alleging breach  of contract,  common law  fraud, conversion,\r<br>\r<br>            interference  with contractual obligations,  and violation of\r<br>\r<br>            the  Massachusetts deceptive  trade practices  statute, Mass.\r<br>\r<br>            Gen.  L. ch. 93A,    2.  Aware  of TFG's precarious financial\r<br>\r<br>            condition, the plaintiffs brought  suit not only against TFG,\r<br>\r<br>            but also against CRI, Locke, and Williamson.\r<br>\r<br>                      At  the  close of  the  evidence,  the trial  judge\r<br>\r<br>            entered  a directed  verdict  against the  plaintiffs on  the\r<br>\r<br>            fraud claim concerning the computer they owned jointly.   The\r<br>\r<br>            defendants then  moved, pursuant to Rule  50(a), for judgment\r<br>\r<br>            as a matter  of law on various  grounds, including a lack  of\r<br>\r<br>            personal jurisdiction.  The district court denied the motion,\r<br>\r<br>            ruling that the personal  jurisdiction issue had been waived,\r<br>\r<br>            but  even  if  it  had not,  that  the  jury  could  find the\r<br>\r<br>            defendants had  sufficient contacts with Massachusetts  for a\r<br>\r<br>            proper exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The jury found for\r<br>\r<br>            the defendants  on the remaining fraud  and interference with\r<br>\r<br>            contractual relations  claims, but for the  plaintiffs on the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -8-\r                                          8\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            breach of contract claim.  The  trial judge reserved decision\r<br>\r<br>            on the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices claim.\r<br>\r<br>                      After  the  verdict,  defendants  again  moved  for\r<br>\r<br>            judgment as a  matter of law,  pursuant to Rule  50(b).   The\r<br>\r<br>            trial court denied  the motion.  At  the same time,  it ruled\r<br>\r<br>            that  the  defendants  had  not  violated  the  Massachusetts\r<br>\r<br>            deceptive trade practices statute,  finding that the decision\r<br>\r<br>            to  breach  the  contract  with the  plaintiffs  was  a valid\r<br>\r<br>            business judgment rather than  an attempt on the part  of the\r<br>\r<br>            defendants to line their pockets.\r<br>\r<br>            Personal Jurisdiction\r            _____________________\r<br>\r<br>                      The defendants  question whether there  is personal\r<br>\r<br>            jurisdiction  over  them  under the  Massachusetts  long  arm\r<br>\r<br>            statute, Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 233A,   3, and  the United States\r<br>\r<br>            Constitution.    The  district  court found  that  all  three\r<br>\r<br>            defendants   had  waived   their   objections   to   personal\r<br>\r<br>            jurisdiction  and that in any event, the jury could find that\r<br>\r<br>            the defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts for\r<br>\r<br>            a  proper  exercise of  jurisdiction.   The  trial  judge was\r<br>\r<br>            plainly   correct   that   CRI  waived   any   objection   to\r<br>\r<br>            jurisdiction:  at  the  final pre-trial  conference,  defense\r<br>\r<br>            counsel  conceded  there  was  no jurisdictional  issue  with\r<br>\r<br>            respect  to CRI.  Because  parties are, as  a general matter,\r<br>\r<br>            bound by  the representations, concessions,  and stipulations\r<br>\r<br>            of  their attorneys,  United States  v.

That  CRI acquired ownership of TFF, Inc. and thus of TFG\r<br>            in 1989  while plaintiffs entered in their contracts with TFG\r<br>            several  years earlier  in 1986  does not  defeat plaintiffs'\r<br>            claim, because the actions leading to  the breach of contract\r<br>            occurred  in   1989  and  1990,   after  CRI  had   made  the\r<br>            acquisition.  Thus, this  case does not involve an  effort to\r<br>            hold  a  later  parent  responsible  for  the  pre-parenthood\r<br>\r<br>                                         -11-\r                                          11\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            of the stock  of TFF, Inc.,  which in turn  owned all of  the\r<br>\r<br>            common stock of TFG (but not its preferred stock).  Thus, CRI\r<br>\r<br>            was the parent once removed.\r<br>\r<br>                      To start,  CRI is a publicly traded,  not a closely\r<br>\r<br>            held  corporation.   Caselaw  and  precedent  elsewhere  draw\r<br>\r<br>            distinctions between  close and public corporations,  and the\r<br>\r<br>            cases where courts have allowed creditors to reach the assets\r<br>\r<br>            of   shareholders   have   almost   always   involved   close\r<br>\r<br>            corporations.

Massachusetts apparently\r<br>\r<br>            has  not yet  addressed the issue  of piercing  the corporate\r<br>\r<br>            veil of a public corporation.

For  several\r<br>\r<br>            months,  defendant Locke  ran TFG's  payroll out  of  his own\r<br>\r<br>            attorney operating account in New York because steps had been\r<br>\r<br>            taken  to  attach  TFG's  Connecticut  account.    Locke  was\r<br>\r<br>            reimbursed  with funds  transferred out  of the  TFG Canadian\r<br>\r<br>            account.   It is undisputed that the funds disbursed by Locke\r<br>\r<br>            and repaid by  TFG went  only to TFG  employees.   Plaintiffs\r<br>\r<br>            were unaware of the  transfers at the time and  the transfers\r<br>\r<br>            did  not affect  them.   This is  not the  sort of  \"confused\r<br>\r<br>            intermingling\"  we think  the Supreme  Judicial Court  had in\r<br>\r<br>            mind.\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs also argue  that confused  intermingling\r<br>\r<br>            was  evident from cash infusions  into TFG by  CRI, Locke and\r<br>\r<br>            Williamson.  However, all  the money transferred from  CRI to\r<br>\r<br>            TFG was in the form  of loans that were properly recorded  in\r<br>\r<br>            the financial records of  both corporations.  Moreover, there\r<br>\r<br>            was insufficient competent evidence  of transfers of money in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -17-\r                                          17\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            the other direction, that is, from TFG to CRI.5   These loans\r<br>\r<br>            do not support the claim of confused intermingling.\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs'   argument   that  there   was  serious\r<br>\r<br>            confusion about  the manner  and  capacity in  which the  two\r<br>\r<br>            corporations and  their  representatives acted  is  similarly\r<br>\r<br>            unpersuasive.   There  is  no  evidence that  there  was  any\r<br>\r<br>            confusion  about on whose behalf a director was acting in any\r<br>\r<br>            given instance.  Locke and Williamson, in their capacities as\r<br>\r<br>            directors of both CRI and TFG, did sometimes act on behalf of\r<br>\r<br>            both corporations simultaneously, but  that is to be expected\r<br>\r<br>            when individuals serve as directors for both a parent and its\r<br>\r<br>            subsidiary.  It is also to be expected that when a subsidiary\r<br>\r<br>            company profits, the parent  company will as well.   That the\r<br>\r<br>            fortunes of CRI and TFG were  to some extent linked does not,\r<br>\r<br>            as  plaintiffs suggest,  militate  in favor  of piercing  the\r<br>\r<br>            corporate veil.\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiffs admitted they were not misled about  the\r<br>\r<br>            relationship  between TFG  and CRI.   Indeed, Massad  did not\r<br>\r<br>            even know that he had invested in TFG, let alone that CRI had\r<br>\r<br>            become its parent.   Plaintiffs neither knew nor  cared about\r<br>\r<br>            the relationship  between CRI and  TFG, but rather  relied on\r<br>\r<br>            their  financial  advisor,   Levinson,  who  understood   the\r<br>\r<br>            corporate relationship.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                \r            ____________________\r<br>\r<br>            5.

Mere overlapping of boards does\r<br>\r<br>            not  meet the test of \"active and direct participation by the\r<br>\r<br>            representatives  of  one  corporation, apparently  exercising\r<br>\r<br>            some form of  pervasive control.\"   My Bread,  233 N.E.2d  at\r                                                ________\r<br>\r<br>            752.     Moreover,  plaintiffs   have  failed  to   show  any\r<br>\r<br>            \"fraudulent  or injurious  consequence of  the intercorporate\r<br>\r<br>            relationship.\"   Plaintiffs argue  that the settlement offers\r<br>\r<br>            were misleading and fraudulent, because defendants attributed\r<br>\r<br>            the  decision to  retain  investment returns  to TFG's  prior\r<br>\r<br>            management,  when  it  had  been  the  decision  of  the  new\r<br>\r<br>            management  to continue  the policy  of violating  investment\r<br>\r<br>            contracts.\r<br>\r<br>                      Even  assuming  this  misrepresentation might  have\r<br>\r<br>            supported  fraud  or  unfair  practices  claims  against  the\r<br>\r<br>            defendants  (claims the  jury  and court  here rejected),  we\r<br>\r<br>            think plaintiffs' argument misses  the point of the corporate\r<br>\r<br>            disregard  doctrine.    The phrase  \"fraudulent  or injurious\r<br>\r<br>            consequence\" is limited  in My  Bread by the  phrase \"of  the\r                                        _________\r<br>\r<br>            intercorporate relationship.\"  There  was no failure to \"make\r<br>\r<br>            clear which  corporation [was] taking action\"  or \"to observe\r<br>\r<br>            with care\" the corporate form.
