Jackson\nsued the defendants in their official and individual capacities. He alleged that\nhis suit arose out of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and that his\nconstitutional rights were violated when he was transferred to administrative\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-60393    Document: 00512225013     Page: 2   Date Filed: 04/30/2013\n\n                                 No. 12-60393\n\nsegregation at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) and exposed\nto tuberculosis in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights.\n      Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). “[T]he party moving for summary\njudgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, but\nneed not negate the elements of the nonmovant’s case.” Little v. Liquid Air\nCorp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted). If the movant meets this burden, the nonmovant must go\nbeyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.   Id.   This court “resolve[s] doubts in favor of the\nnonmoving party and make[s] all reasonable inferences in favor of that party.”\nDean v. City of Shreveport, 438 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir. 2006).\n      In his brief, Jackson fails to provide facts and argument challenging the\nmagistrate judge’s decision to dismiss Jackson’s claims regarding his removal\nfrom the general prison population under the ADA and the Due Process Clause\nfor failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the magistrate judge’s\ndetermination that Epps was entitled to summary judgment on Jackson’s claims\nagainst him in his official capacity, and the magistrate judge’s determination\nthat GEO was entitled to summary judgment because Jackson failed to allege\nit implemented an unconstitutional policy. Jackson has abandoned these claims\nby failing to brief them. See Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.\n1993).\n      Jackson argues that he had the right to be protected from disease and that\nthe defendants failed to attend to his medical needs when they did not remove\nhim from the cell where he was exposed to tuberculosis. Jackson testified that\nhe and other inmates were placed in crowded living conditions and that inmate\nDavis exhibited symptoms of coughing and vomiting before the defendants\nremoved him from “little seg.” He also testified, however, that after Davis was\n\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 12-60393    Document: 00512225013     Page: 3     Date Filed: 04/30/2013\n\n                                 No. 12-60393\n\ndiagnosed with tuberculosis, prison officials removed Davis from the unit where\nJackson and the other prisoners were housed and they did not see him again.\nJackson further testified that he and his fellow inmates were quarantined,\ntested, and medicated. In light of this testimony, Jackson fails to demonstrate\nthat the individual GEO defendants acted with deliberate indifference. Wilson\nv. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 297 (1991); see Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 847\n(1994); Gibbs v. Grimmette, 254 F.3d 545, 549-50 (5th Cir. 2001).\n      According to Jackson, “the MDOC defendants” had him transferred to the\nEMCF in retaliation for filing an ADA suit. Jackson cannot overcome summary\njudgment on his retaliation claim because he does not identify which of “the\nMDOC defendants” had the intent to retaliate against him or who among them\ncaused the transfer. See Jones v. Greninger, 188 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir. 1999).\nConclusory allegations of retaliation are not sufficient to withstand a proper\nmotion for dismissal of the claim. Jones, 188 F.3d at 325. Although Jackson\nidentifies the wardens as the responsible party, the magistrate judge dismissed\nthe claims against Wardens Grimes and Caskey as unexhausted, and Jackson\ndoes not brief this issue. See Yohey, 985 F.2d at 224-25.\n      In addition to assigning error to the magistrate judge’s summary judgment\ndismissal of his constitutional claims, Jackson complains that he was not\nallowed to conduct discovery. Our review of discovery decisions is for an abuse\nof discretion, and we will affirm such decisions unless they are arbitrary or\nclearly unreasonable. Moore v. Willis Indep. Sch. Dist., 233 F.3d 871, 876 (5th\nCir. 2000). Jackson has not made the required showing. Moore, 233 F.3d at 876.\n      Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\f",
