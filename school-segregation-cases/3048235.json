Jacobs (argued), Snell & Wilmer L.L.P., Tucson,\nArizona; Vaughn A. Crawford, Martha E. Gibbs, and\nBenjamin M. Mitsuda, Snell & Wilmer L.L.P., Phoenix,\nArizona, for Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge:\n\n    The Fair Housing Act (FHA) is one of the most important\npieces of legislation to be enacted by the Congress in the past\n60 years. It strikes at the heart of the persistent racism that so\ndeeply troubles our Nation. Here, we deal with one aspect of\nthat law: zoning or rezoning of land as it affects the\n\f4       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nconstruction of housing that may be affordable by significant\nnumbers of members of minority groups.\n\n    Plaintiffs, two real estate developers (“Developers”),\nbring this case against the City of Yuma, contending that the\nCity’s refusal to rezone land to permit higher-density\ndevelopment violated, among other things, the Equal\nProtection Clause of the United States Constitution and the\nfederal Fair Housing Act (FHA). In particular, Developers\nmaintain that the City’s refusal stemmed from intentional\ndiscrimination against Hispanics and created a disparate\nimpact because the denial disproportionately deprives\nHispanic residents of housing opportunities and perpetuates\nsegregation. The district court first dismissed Developers’\nEqual Protection and FHA disparate-treatment claims under\nRule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and denied\nDevelopers’ motion for leave to file a Second Amended\nComplaint. It then granted summary judgment in favor of the\nCity on Developers’ disparate-impact claim, rejecting both\ntheories on which Developers relied.\n\n     Taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true, we\nfirst hold that Developers presented plausible claims for relief\nfor disparate treatment under the FHA and under the Equal\nProtection Clause. The City Council denied Developers’\nrequest for rezoning despite the advice of its own experts to\nthe contrary and in the context of what a reasonable jury\ncould interpret as racially charged opposition by Yuma\nresidents. This was the only request for rezoning that the City\nhad denied in the last three years or of the last 76\napplications. We reverse the district court because it failed to\ngive sufficient weight to the City Council’s alleged\ncapitulation to the animus of the development’s opponents, in\nthe face of the City’s own expert’s recommendation to\n\f         AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                           5\n\napprove the request and its practice of generally granting\nthese requests. Given these circumstances, the complaint\npasses the plausibility bar. We remand to the district court on\nthese claims.\n\n    We also reverse and remand the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the City on Developers’\ndisparate-impact claim and vacate its denial of the second\nsummary judgment motion as moot. We reject the district\ncourt’s view that other similarly-priced and similarly-\nmodelled housing available elsewhere necessarily precluded\na finding that there was a disparate impact. We remand for\nthe district court to address the City’s second motion for\nsummary judgment in the first instance.1\n\n                          JURISDICTION\n\n   The district court had jurisdiction over Developers’\n§ 1983 claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 and over\nDevelopers’ FHA claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. See\nMunger v. City of Glasgow Police Dep’t, 227 F.3d 1082,\n1085 (9th Cir. 2000). We have jurisdiction over Developers’\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. See Budnick v. Town of\nCarefree, 518 F.3d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n                      LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n    Dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is\ninappropriate unless the complaint fails to “state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\n\n 1\n   In that motion, the City contends that Developers have failed to proffer\nstatistical evidence demonstrating a substantial disparate impact resulting\nfrom the zoning denial.\n\f6      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “When the district court\ndenies leave to amend [a complaint] because of futility of\namendment, we will uphold such denial if it is clear, upon de\nnovo review, that the complaint would not be saved by any\namendment.” Carvalho v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC,\n629 F.3d 876, 893 (9th Cir. 2010). A district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment is also reviewed de novo. Pac. Shores\nProps., LLC v. City of Newport Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1156\n(9th Cir. 2013).\n\n              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n    According to the complaint, Plaintiffs, Avenue 6E\nInvestments, LLC and Saguaro Desert Land, Inc. are business\nentities owned by members of the Hall family, who develop\nhousing in Yuma, Arizona. Through Developers and other\naffiliated companies, members of the Hall family have\ndeveloped various affordable and moderately priced housing\nprojects in Yuma. Thus, Developers are sometimes referred\nto as “Hall” or “Hall Construction.” Developers allege that\neven though the Hall family’s affiliated companies build a\nfull range of housing products, they nevertheless have a\nreputation as a developer of Hispanic neighborhoods based\nupon their development of several affordable housing projects\nin Yuma in which the majority of homes were sold to\nHispanics.\n\n    Avenue 6E owned 42 acres of undeveloped land in\nsoutheastern Yuma (the “Property”), and granted Saguaro an\noption to purchase the Property for the purpose of developing\na “moderately priced” housing project. As Developers state\nin their opening brief on appeal, their references to their\nproposed development as “affordable” and “moderately\npriced” are descriptive only and do not imply that such\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                7\n\nprojects are considered “affordable” as defined by the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nDevelopers allege that the City denied a requested zoning\nchange in September 2008 in response to animus by\nneighbors of the proposed development who wished to\nprevent the development of a heavily Hispanic neighborhood\nadjacent to their subdivisions, in which 75% of the population\nwas White.\n\n    Between 2002 and 2010, the City performed two\nanalyses—specifically, the Consolidated Plan and Analysis\nof Impediments to Fair Housing Choice for 2002, as well as\na 2007 version by the same name (respectively, the “2002\nAnalysis of Impediments” and the “2007 Analysis of\nImpediments”)—each showing that the Hispanic population\nin Yuma was concentrated in several areas in the northern,\nwestern, and central portions of the City. The analyses show\nthat substantially all of the available low- to moderate-income\nhousing was located in those areas, and that more than 75%\nof the households in that housing were Hispanic. The reports\nfound that, by contrast, Whites were concentrated in separate\nareas in the northwest and southeast of Yuma in which they\ncomprised more than 75% of the population. The Property is\non the western boundary of what was, at that time, one of the\nWhite-majority areas in the Southeast portion of Yuma.\n\n    The City’s General Plan prohibits actions promoting\nracial segregation, and its 2002 Analysis of Impediments\nrecognizes the need to encourage the development of more\naffordable housing choices to low- and moderate-income\ncitizens outside the areas with high concentrations of\nHispanic households. The 2002 Analysis warned, however,\nthat residents had used “NIMBY” (not-in-my-backyard)\narguments to block or delay several affordable housing\n\f8      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\ndevelopments; the Analysis thus recommended an\neducational campaign to promote acceptance of affordable\nhousing, lower-income neighborhoods, and cultural diversity.\nThe General Plan acknowledges that large-lot zoning raises\nhousing costs and impairs the availability of housing\naffordable to low- and moderate-income purchasers, and\nidentifies higher-density zoning as a means for the City to\nencourage desegregation. The 2002 General Plan noted\nwealth disparities within Yuma, stating that “Hispanic,\nAfrican American and Native American households are more\nlikely to have lower income and live below the poverty line.”\n\n    The City’s General Plan designates the Property for use\nas “Low Density Residential.” This designation encompasses\ntwo permissible zoning designations: “R-1-6” zoning, which\nallows development of a residential subdivision of houses\nplaced on 6,000 square foot lots, and “R-1-8” zoning, which\nrequires the use of at least 8,000 square foot lots. In 2006,\nDevelopers purchased the Property from KDC of Yuma, LLC\n(“KDC”), another housing developer, which had previously\nrezoned the Property from agricultural use to R-1-8. The\nProperty is bordered on the south by the 38-acre “Belleza\nSubdivision,” which consists of homes on lots exceeding\n9,000 square feet; on the north by the “Country Roads”\nrecreational village, consisting of 2,500 square foot lots\nlimited to persons age 55 and over; on the west by the 80-acre\n“Terra Bella Subdivision” owned by Perricone Development\nGroup II (“Perricone”), a developer of luxury homes; and to\nthe east by a parcel the City intends to use to expand a\nwastewater facility and a municipal park.\n\n   In 2008, Developers determined that development of the\nProperty with R-1-8 zoning was no longer financially feasible\ndue to the collapse of the housing market and a corresponding\n\f       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                9\n\ndifficulty in selling 8,000 square foot lots. They determined,\nhowever, that there existed a need in Yuma for more\naffordable housing, and designed a higher-density,\nmoderately priced housing project for the Property consistent\nwith the City’s General Plan and consisting of 6,000 square\nfoot lots. Developers subsequently applied to rezone the\nProperty from R-1-8 to R-1-6. The City’s staff and in-house\nplanning experts both recommended approval of the zoning\nrequest.\n\n     Subsequently, the City Planning and Zoning Commission\nheld a public hearing on Developers’ zoning application.\nSeveral homeowners from the Belleza Subdivision wrote\nletters or spoke at the hearing objecting that Developers\n“catered” to low- to moderate-income families. They\ncomplained that the people living in “the Hall\nneighborhoods” tended to have large households, use single-\nfamily homes as multi-family dwellings, allow unattended\nchildren to roam the streets, own numerous vehicles which\nthey parked in the streets and in their yards, lack pride of\nownership, and fail to maintain their residences. These\ncharacteristics, Developers allege, coincide with a\nstereotypical description of Yuma’s Hispanic neighborhoods.\nThe Commission voted unanimously to approve the rezoning\nrequest, noting that many subdivisions with small-sized lots\nhad previously been built adjacent to large-sized lot\nsubdivisions without incident. The rezoning request was then\nforwarded to the City Council with the recommendations of\nthe Planning Staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission\nthat the request be granted.\n\n   Prior to rendering its decision, the City Council received\ncomplaints from landowners near the Property commenting\non the fact that Developers build affordable housing and\n\f10     AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\ncriticizing the proposed development in terms Developers\nallege are well-known in Yuma as descriptive of Hispanic\nneighborhoods. One landowner complained that Developers’\nproposal would create “a low cost, high crime neighborhood.”\nThe City Council held a public hearing. Several landowners\nattending the hearing brought photographs of Developers’\nTrail Estate Subdivision, in which 77% of homebuyers were\nHispanic, which they identified as an “affordable housing\nproject.” One Belleza homeowner sent the following letter\nasking the City Council to deny Developers’ rezoning\nrequest:\n\n       We as well as many other families are very\n       aware of the type of ‘homes’ and\n       ‘neighborhoods’ the ‘Hall Construction’\n       company has built in the past. If any of the\n       council members are unaware of what I am\n       referring to, I urge them to please drive\n       through the many ‘Hall’ neighborhoods in\n       particular the ones with the comparable price\n       and square footage that the Halls have\n       proposed to build next to us. After doing so I\n       ask council members to please ask themselves\n       if they would want to live around these areas\n       after having paid such a significant amount\n       for their home. . . . From my first hand\n       experience in comparing these Hall\n       subdivisions with our subdivisions\n       particularly Kerley subdivision, it is evident\n       that the Hall subdivision has a higher rate of\n       unattended juveniles roaming the streets, as\n       well as domestic violence, theft, burglaries,\n       and criminal damage/vandalism to properties.\n       It was my experience that many owners of\n\f       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA               11\n\n       these homes left juveniles unattended as well\n       as many of these homes were not single\n       family dwellings like they were designated to\n       be and instead turned into multifamily\n       dwellings which in turn led to more\n       unattended juveniles and crime. . . . We find it\n       very disappointing that we have worked very\n       hard to keep out children out of areas like this,\n       as well as worked very hard to come up with\n       the funds in order to buy the home that we\n       live in. Now we are faced with the possibility\n       that once again the Hall Construction\n       company wants to add another one of these\n       ‘subdivisions’ in Yuma.\n\nAnother landowner sent a letter to the Council stating that:\n\n       According to the US Department of Justice,\n       households with incomes of less than $75,000\n       account for 91% of all crimes nationally as\n       well as 91% of all rape, murder, assault,\n       armed robbery, etc. The type of lots and\n       houses that Hall Construction is considering\n       will be catering to this group of people. What\n       will this cost the city and county of Yuma to\n       patrol this area and how many innocent\n       victims from Belleza, Terra Bella and Tillman\n       Estates will fall victim to a predator in this\n       91% demographic?\n\nA third landowner complained that graffiti is a problem in\nsmall-home subdivisions. One Councilmember described the\nHall Companies’ subdivisions as having cars parked on the\nstreets and in yards, and asked whether the garages\n\f12       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nenvisioned for the Property would be large enough to\naccommodate pickup trucks.\n\n    Developers proposed creating a “buffer” zone of 8,000\nsquare foot lots separating the Property from the Belleza and\nTerra Bella subdivisions, with 6,000 square foot lots placed\nbetween the buffer zone and the Country Roads RV park.\nOne landowner commented that Developers’ proposal would\ncreate a smooth transition in terms of lot size, but not of\n“ownership demographics.” Reacting to the criticism of\nDevelopers’ proposal, a City Council member stated that\nsubdivisions of different densities will inevitably abut each\nother, and voiced his concern that denying Developers’\napplication on the basis of the community’s concerns would\ncreate an “unsustainable precedent” for future zoning\ndecisions.2 At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council\ndenied Developers’ rezoning request.3 This rezoning request\nwas the only one of 76 applications considered by the City\nCouncil over the preceding three years that it had rejected.\n\n              PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    Developers commenced this action in February 2009,\nalleging a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and\n\n\n 2\n   Although the Second Amended Complaint identifies the speaker as the\nYuma Mayor, Developers state in their Opening Brief that the speaker was\nin fact a member of the City Council.\n 3\n   Although not relevant to the complaint (or motion to dismiss), the City\ndisputes Developers’ account and maintains that it denied the zoning\nrequest because property owners had relied upon the pre-existing R-1-8\nzoning designation and because Developers, rather than the City, rejected\na compromise buffer-zone plan.\n\f         AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                       13\n\nclaims of disparate impact and disparate treatment under the\nFair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. In early\n2010, the district court granted the City’s motion to dismiss\nDevelopers’ disparate-treatment claims under the Equal\nProtection Clause and the FHA,4 but denied the City’s motion\nas to Developers’ disparate-impact claim under the FHA.5\nLater that year, Developers filed a motion for leave to file a\nSecond Amended Complaint, which attempted, inter alia, to\nadd additional facts, including the fact that the Developers’\nrezoning request was the only one rejected out of 76 in the\npreceding three years. The district court denied this motion\nto amend on the ground that amendment would be futile.\n\n    After completing discovery on Developers’ remaining\nclaim, the disparate-impact claim, the City filed two motions\nfor summary judgment regarding that claim. The first motion\ncontended that Developers could not prove disparate impact\nbecause there was an adequate supply of similarly priced and\nmodelled housing in the Southeast quadrant of Yuma and that\n“on this separate and distinct basis alone” summary judgment\nshould be granted. In that motion, the City proffered no other\nreason for the grant of summary judgment. Four days later,\nthe City filed the second motion, in which it contended that\n(1) Developers’ had failed to show a disparate impact on\nHispanics resulting from the denial of the rezoning\n\n\n  4\n    We refer to both the claim for intentional discrimination under the\nEqual Protection Clause and the disparate-treatment claim under the FHA\nas “disparate-treatment claims” for ease of analysis.\n 5\n   The district court also dismissed Developers’ substantive due process\nclaims under the Federal and Arizona Constitutions as well as a claim\nunder Arizona Revised Statute § 9-452-01(F), which requires that\nrezoning ordinances conform to the adopted general plan of the\nmunicipality. Developers do not appeal the dismissal of these claims.\n\f14       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\napplication, and (2) the City denied the rezoning application\nfor legally sufficient reasons. The district court granted the\nCity’s first summary judgment motion,6 expressly stating that\nit did not reach the issues raised by the second motion, and\nthen denied the second motion as moot.7 It entered judgment,\nholding that the adequate supply of similarly-priced and\nmodelled housing in Southeast Yuma foreclosed any finding\nof disparate impact. Ave. 6E, 2013 WL 2455928, at *2, *7.\nThe district court also rejected Developers’ perpetuation-of-\nsegregation theory for its disparate-impact claim. It held that\nundisputed statistics showed that “the integrative effect of\nthat development . . . would not have been significant enough\nto support a disparate impact claim” based on the\nperpetuation-of-segregation theory. Id. at *7. Developers\ntimely appealed.\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\n     Developers challenge the district court’s dismissal of their\ndisparate-treatment claims and grant of the City’s first motion\nfor summary judgment on the disparate-impact claim.

Ct. at 2516 (quoting Report of\nthe National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders 1\n(Kerner Commission)). It took this “grim prophecy,” and the\nsocial unrest that gripped the country following the murder of\nDr. King, for Congress to act and pass the FHA. Id. at 2516,\n2525.\n\n    The FHA declares that “it is the policy of the United\nStates to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair\nhousing throughout the United States.” 42 U.S.C. § 3601. To\nachieve this goal, the FHA renders it unlawful to, among\nother things, “make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\n\f16      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nperson because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or\nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). As relevant to this\ncase, it provides several tools to do so.\n\n    First, and most obvious, it prohibits intentional\ndiscrimination—that is, disparate treatment. A private\ndeveloper or governmental body cannot refuse to sell or rent\nhousing to someone because of that person’s race, religion,\ngender, or other protected characteristic, nor can a\ngovernment zone land or refuse to zone land out of concern\nthat minorities would enter a neighborhood. See Pac. Shores\nProps., 730 F.3d at 1157 (noting that the FHA prohibits\ndiscriminatory zoning practices). If a governmental actor\nengages in this discrimination, such conduct also violates the\nEqual Protection Clause. Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977) (noting, in the context of\na zoning challenge, that “[w]hen there is a proof that a\ndiscriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor” in a\ngovernment decision, judicial deference to that decision is not\njustified under the Equal Protection Clause).\n\n    Given the long history and dire consequences of\ncontinuing housing discrimination and segregation, Congress\ndid not stop at prohibiting disparate treatment alone. Indeed,\nin enacting the FHA, Congress sought “to eradicate\ndiscriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s\neconomy.” Tex. Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. To this\nend, as the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, the FHA also\nencompasses a second distinct claim of discrimination,\ndisparate impact, that forbids actions by private or\ngovernmental bodies that create a discriminatory effect upon\na protected class or perpetuate housing segregation without\nany concomitant legitimate reason. Id. at 2522. Disparate\nimpact provides a remedy in two situations that disparate\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                17\n\ntreatment may not reach. First, “[i]t permits plaintiffs to\ncounteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that\nescape easy classification.” Id.; see also Huntington Branch,\nN.A.A.C.P. v. Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935 (2d Cir. 1988)\n(noting that “clever men may easily conceal their\nmotivations” and that disparate-impact analysis is needed\nbecause “[o]ften, such [facially neutral] rules bear no relation\nto discrimination upon passage, but develop into powerful\ndiscriminatory mechanisms when applied”).              Second,\ndisparate impact not only serves to uncover unconscious or\nconsciously hidden biases, but also targets “artificial,\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers” to minority housing and\nintegration that can occur through unthinking, even if not\nmalignant, policies of developers and governmental entities.\nTex. Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. In this way, disparate\nimpact “recognize[s] that the arbitrary quality of\nthoughtlessness can be as disastrous and unfair to private\nrights and the public interest as the perversity of a willful\nscheme.” United States v. City of Black Jack, Mo., 508 F.2d\n1179, 1185 (8th Cir. 1974).\n\n    Today, the policy to provide fair housing nationwide\nannounced in the FHA remains as important as ever.\n42 U.S.C. § 3601. While “many cities have become more\ndiverse” after “the passage of the [FHA] and against the\nbackdrop of disparate-impact liability in nearly every\njurisdiction,” Texas Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2525,\nhousing segregation both perpetuates and reflects this\ncountry’s basic problems regarding race relations:\neducational disparities, police-community relations, crime\nlevels, wealth inequality, and even access to basic needs such\nas clean water and clean air. In this country, the\nneighborhood in which a person is born or lives will still far\ntoo often determine his or her opportunity for success. As the\n\f18      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nSupreme Court recognized, the FHA must play a “continuing\nrole in moving the Nation toward a more integrated society”\nand a more just one. Id.\n\n    Given this context, we now turn to Developers’ claims in\nthis case.\n\n             II. Disparate-Treatment Claims\n\n    Developers first bring disparate-treatment claims under\nthe FHA and the Equal Protection Clause, alleging that the\nCity refused their request to rezone the Property because of\ndiscrimination or animus against Hispanics. The district\ncourt dismissed these claims and found the request for leave\nto amend futile, holding that Developers did not allege\nplausible claims for relief in the first or seconded amended\ncomplaints. Although Developers appeal both the dismissal\nof their first amended complaint and the district court’s denial\nof their motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,\nwe address only whether the second amended complaint\nstated a plausible claim for relief because the first and second\namended complaints were both rejected based on plausibility\nand because the second amended complaint would have\n“supersede[d] the original” if allowed. See Ramirez v. Cnty.\nof San Bernardino, 806 F.3d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir. 2015); see\nalso Dorf v. Bjorklund, 531 F. App’x 836, 837 (10th Cir.\n2013) (ruling only on motion for leave to amend when the\nplaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the first amended\ncomplaint and the denial for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint on the basis of futility). Because the second\namended complaint contains sufficient allegations that the\nCity’s decision was driven by animus to state a plausible\nclaim for relief, we hold that the amendment was not futile\nand reverse the dismissal of the disparate-treatment claims.\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                19\n\n    Arlington Heights governs our inquiry whether it is\nplausible that, in violation of the FHA and the Equal\nProtection Clause, an “invidious discriminatory purpose was\na motivating factor” behind the City’s decision to deny the\nzoning application. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266.\nUnder Arlington Heights, a plaintiff must “‘simply produce\ndirect or circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a\ndiscriminatory reason more likely that not motivated’ the\ndefendant and that the defendant’s actions adversely affected\nthe plaintiff in some way.” Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at\n1158 (quoting McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103,\n1122 (9th Cir. 2004)). “A plaintiff does not have to prove\nthat the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of the\nchallenged action, but only that it was a ‘motivating factor.’”\nArce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266). The court analyzes\nwhether a discriminatory purpose motivated the defendant by\nexamining the events leading up to the challenged decision\nand the legislative history behind it, the defendant’s departure\nfrom normal procedures or substantive conclusions, and the\nhistorical background of the decision and whether it creates\na disparate impact. Id. (citing Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n266–68, and Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at at 1158–59).\nThese elements are non-exhaustive, Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at 268; Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at 1159, and a\nplaintiff need not establish any particular element in order to\nprevail, see Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at 1156 (stating\nthat, for the purpose of summary judgment, “any indication\nof discriminatory motive may suffice to raise a question that\ncan only be resolved by a factfinder”). We examine each in\nturn.\n\f20      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\n A. Sequence of Events Leading Up to the Challenged\n        Decision and the Legislative History\n\n    The gravamen of Developers’ disparate-treatment claims\nis that the City discriminated against them by denying their\napplication in order to appease its constituents, despite\nknowing that opposition to the application was based largely\non racial animus, and despite the recommendations of its\nzoning commission and planning staff and its regular\npractice. Here, the allegations in the complaint are sufficient\nto raise these claims.\n\n    The presence of community animus can support a finding\nof discriminatory motives by government officials, even if the\nofficials do not personally hold such views. Innovative\nHealth Sys., Inc. v. City of White Plains, 117 F.3d 37, 49 (2d\nCir. 1997), superseded on other grounds as recognized in\nZervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2001);\nLeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 67 F.3d 412, 425 (2d Cir.\n1995) (plaintiff alleging a disparate-treatment claim under the\nFHA “can establish a prima facie case by showing that\nanimus against the protected group was a significant factor in\nthe position taken by the municipal decision-makers\nthemselves or by those to whom the decision-makers were\nknowingly responsive.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThis standard “recognize[s] the reality of such controversial\nproposals in the urban setting,” United States v. City of New\nOrleans, 2012 WL 6085081, at *9 (E.D. La. Dec. 6, 2012),\nin which council members may vote based on constituents\nconcerns about “an influx of undesirables” into the\nneighborhood. Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055,\n1066 (4th Cir. 1982).\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                 21\n\n     Neither Budnick nor Arlington Heights, which the City\ncites to support its position, holds otherwise. In Budnick, the\nplaintiff sought a special use permit to build a continuing-care\nretirement community and, only after the Town Council\ndenied his application, raised for the first time the contention\nthat the planned facility would serve disabled residents;\nplaintiff in his prior declarations had asserted that residents\nwould be limited to “healthy, active, independent seniors.”\nBudnick, 518 F.3d at 1112–13. This alone undercut any\nfinding of discriminatory intent by the Town Council, as the\nplaintiff failed to explain how the Town could have\ndiscriminated against residents it did not know would be\nhoused at the facility. Here, by contrast, Developers allege\nthat their reputation as developers of subdivisions favored by\nHispanics, and the general demographic trends suggesting\nthat the higher-density development they proposed would\nattract a greater number of Hispanic homebuyers, were\nknown prior to the denial of their application. Accordingly,\nhere, unlike in Budnick, community members’ opposition to\nDevelopers’ application, using language indicating animus\ntoward a protected class, provides circumstantial evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent by the City.\n\n     The facts of Arlington Heights likewise do not support\ndefendant’s argument. In that case, the Supreme Court\naffirmed the district court’s finding following a trial that,\nalthough some opponents of plaintiffs’ requested zoning\nchange might have been motivated by opposition to minority\ngroups, the evidence did not warrant the conclusion that this\nmotivated defendants. 429 U.S. at 269–70. Unlike this case,\nthe Supreme Court in Arlington Heights was required to\nreview the district court’s factual finding for clear error after\na trial, while here we must accept Developers’ allegations as\ntrue and review the district court’s order de novo. See\n\f22      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 566 (1985);\nNewark Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. City of Bayonne, N.J.,\n134 F.3d 113, 119–20 (3d Cir. 1998). Moreover, other facts\nnot similar to any before the district court on the present\nmotion to dismiss supported the district court’s factual\nfinding in Arlington Heights. For example, as the Supreme\nCourt noted, the area surrounding the site of the desired\nzoning change to permit high-density zoning had been zoned\nfor single-family homes for more than a decade, and the\nzoning change would have been contrary to a “buffer policy”\nconsistently applied in prior instances. 429 U.S. at 269.\nHere, by contrast, the R-1-6 zoning sought by Developers\nwas entirely consistent with the City’s General Plan.\n\n    Although the relevant cases clearly hold that a city’s\ndenial of a zoning change following discriminatory\nstatements by members of the public supports a claim of\ndiscriminatory intent, the question remains whether the\nstatements alleged in Developers’ Second Amended\nComplaint actually constituted animus. None of the alleged\nstatements expressly refers to race or national origin; rather,\nthey raise various concerns about issues including large\nfamilies, unattended children, parking, and crime. We have\nheld, however, that the use of “code words” may demonstrate\ndiscriminatory intent. Galdamez v. Potter, 415 F.3d 1015,\n1024 n.6 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing McGinest, 360 F.3d at 1117).\nIn McGinest, we adopted the reasoning of the Third Circuit’s\nopinion in Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d\n1074, 1083 (3d Cir. 1996). Considering comments that\nplaintiff, an African American, was a “drug dealer,” we\nquoted Aman at length:\n\n       [A] reasonable jury could conclude that the\n       intent to discriminate is implicit in these\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA               23\n\n       comments.       There are no talismanic\n       expressions which must be invoked as a\n       condition-precedent to the application of laws\n       designed to protect against discrimination.\n       The words themselves are only relevant for\n       what they reveal–the intent of the speaker. A\n       reasonable jury could find that statements like\n       the ones allegedly made in this case send a\n       clear message and carry the distinct tone of\n       racial motivations and implications. They\n       could be seen as conveying the message that\n       members of a particular race are disfavored\n       and that members of that race are, therefore,\n       not full and equal members of the workplace.\n\nMcGinest, 360 F.3d at 1117 (quoting Aman, 85 F.3d at 1083)\n(alteration in original). The McGinest court then held that\n“[t]he reference to [plaintiff, an African-American] as a ‘drug\ndealer’ might certainly be deemed to be a code word or\nphrase” demonstrating animus. Id.; see also Guimaraes v.\nSuperValu, Inc., 674 F.3d 962, 974 (8th Cir. 2012)\n(“[R]acially charged code words may provide evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent by sending a clear message and carrying\nthe distinct tone of racial motivations and implications.”)\n(quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original); Jenkins v.\nMethodist Hosps. of Dallas, 478 F.3d 255, 265 (5th Cir.\n2007) (citing Aman, 85 F.3d at 1083). Whether a code word\nevidences racial animus may depend upon factors including\nlocal custom and historical usage. Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,\n546 U.S. 454, 456 (2006). Although these cases involve\nemployment rather than housing discrimination, these lessons\nare equally applicable to both types of cases. See Texas Dep’t\nof Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522–23.\n\f24      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\n     Here, construing the allegations in the complaint in favor\nof plaintiffs as well as drawing all inferences in their favor,\nthe alleged statements by the neighborhood opposition\nsubmitted to city officials contained such code words\nconsisting of stereotypes of Hispanics that would be well-\nunderstood in Yuma. Neighbors expressed concern that the\ntype of people living in “the Hall neighborhoods” had large\nhouseholds and used single-family homes as multi-family\ndwellings. These people, neighbors complained, own\nnumerous vehicles which they park in the streets and yards,\nfail to maintain their residences, and lack pride of ownership.\nThey also allow unattended children to roam the streets (what\nsome may call letting children play in the neighborhood).\nSeveral landowners attending the public hearing even brought\npictures of another Hall subdivision, in which 77% of the\nhomebuyers are Hispanic, to exemplify the complaints they\nhad about the potential new development. See Greater New\nOrleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. St. Bernard Parish, 641 F.\nSupp. 2d 563, 571–72 (E.D. La. 2009) (repeated references to\nVillage Square, where Village Square was a local complex\nwith a significant black population, demonstrated racial\nanimus). After Developers presented their compromise plan\nto transition from the 8,000-foot lots down to 6,000-foot lots\nnear the RV park, another landowner noted that it would be\na smooth transition in terms of lot size, but not ownership\ndemographics, suggesting—at least to a reasonable juror—a\nchange in racial composition. In sum, landowners worried\nthat the type of people who live in “Hall neighborhoods”\ncreate a “low cost, high crime neighborhood” that these\nlandowners had worked hard “to keep our children out of.”\nSee id. (finding references to crime were “racially-loaded”);\nAtkins v. Robinson, 545 F. Supp. 852, 874 (E.D. Va. 1982)\n(reference to “an abundance of crime” “may be interpreted as\n[a] veiled reference[] to race”).\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                 25\n\n    Taken together, these allegations, along with the\nallegation that Developers are known to many as a developer\nof Hispanic neighborhoods on the basis of their housing\nprojects in Yuma, provide plausible circumstantial evidence\nthat community opposition to Developers’ proposed\ndevelopment was motivated in part by animus, and that the\nCity Council was fully aware of these concerns when it took\nthe highly unusual step of acceding to the opposition and\noverruling the recommendations of its zoning commission\nand planning staff.\n\n  B. City’s Departure from its Normal Procedures or\n               Substantive Conclusions\n\n    Developers also plausibly allege that the denial of their\nzoning application departed from the City’s normal\nprocedures. In denying the rezoning, the City Council’s\ndecision ran contrary to the unanimous recommendation\nprovided by the City’s Planning and Zoning Commission, as\nwell as the recommendation of City planning staff. A city’s\ndecision to disregard the zoning advice of its own experts can\nprovide evidence of discriminatory intent, particularly when,\nas here, that recommendation is consonant with the\nmunicipality’s general zoning requirements and plaintiffs\nproffer additional evidence of animus. See Innovative Health\nSys., 117 F.3d at 49 (affirming grant of preliminary injunction\nand stating that city’s zoning body “ignored the requirements\nof the ‘hospital or sanitaria’ classification and did not explain\nwhy it declined to follow the Corporation Counsel’s\nstraightforward analysis”); Sunrise Dev., Inc. v. Town of\nHuntington, N.Y., 62 F. Supp. 2d 762, 775, 776 (E.D.N.Y.\n1999) (concluding that Town’s disregard of its Citizen’s\nAdvisory Committee’s recommendation suggested that\n“defendants likely were swayed by the anti-disabled animus\n\f26     AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\npresent in the community”); Dews v. Town of Sunnyvale,\nTex., 109 F. Supp. 2d 526, 572 (N.D. Tex. 2000)\n(“[Defendant’s] history of ignoring the recommendations of\nits planners and proceeding in the face of sound legal and\nplanning advice” weighed towards finding of discriminatory\nintent); MHANY Mgmt. Inc. v. Cnty. of Nassau, 843 F. Supp.\n2d 287, 321–22 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (city’s decision to disregard\nits own consultant’s zoning recommendation and the\nCounty’s desires supported finding of discriminatory intent);\nbut cf. Hallmark Developers, 466 F.3d at 1285 (finding\nCounty Board’s decision to ignore recommendations of\napproval from its staff and planning bodies was not suspect\nbecause no larger context demonstrated racial animus).\nDevelopers’ allegation that the City’s prior zoning decisions\npermitted “many examples in Yuma where large lot\nexpensive subdivisions had been built next to moderately\npriced small lot housing subdivisions without problems”\nfurther underscores the inference that the decision to deny\nDevelopers’ application was contrary to normal procedures.\nFinally, this zoning request was the only request the City\nCouncil denied of the 76 considered over the three years\npreceding the Council’s decision. Drawing all reasonable\ninferences in Developers’ favor, the City’s singling out of\ntheir zoning request for denial supports Developers’\ncontention that the City had a discriminatory intent.\n\nC. Disparate Impact and the Historical Background of\n                    the Decision\n\n    The complaint’s statistics on the disparate impact caused\nby the decision and the historical background of the decision\nalso tend to make the disparate-treatment claims plausible.\n\f         AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                        27\n\n    Developers allege specific facts demonstrating city\nofficials’ awareness that the effect of their denial of\nDevelopers’ application would “bear[] more heavily on one\nrace than another” in light of historical patterns of segregation\nby race and class.8          Specifically, they allege facts\ndemonstrating that distinct areas of the city historically have\nbeen populated, respectively, by lower class Hispanics and\nmore affluent Whites. They point to the 2002 and 2007\nAnalyses of Impediments, each of which shows that\n“substantially all of the available low- to moderate-income\nhousing” in Yuma has historically been concentrated in three\nareas of the city in which more than 75% of the households\nare Hispanic, whereas Whites have been concentrated in two\nother areas in which the White population has been more than\n75%.9 They also allege facts contained in the City’s General\nPlan and the U.S. Census identifying a direct relationship\nbetween housing density and costs, and demonstrating a\n\n\n  8\n    Even though the proposed development would not have qualified as\n“affordable” under HUD regulations, alleged facts regarding the\ndistribution of affordable housing in Yuma’s Hispanic neighborhoods help\ndemonstrate general income stratification supporting the inference that\nHispanics in Yuma are generally less affluent than Whites and would be\nmore likely to purchase homes built on the smaller lots proposed by\nDevelopers.\n   9\n     Although not relevant to our consideration of the district court’s\ndismissal of the disparate-treatment claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), new\ndata developed during the summary judgment phase showed that this\npercentage has changed in Southeast Yuma as a whole, though not\nnecessarily in any particular part of that quadrant of the City. While the\nCity’s 2002 and 2007 Analysis of Impediments noted that Southeast Yuma\nhad a White population of 75%, the 2012 version of the same report shows\nthat the White population in that area as a whole decreased to between\n48% and 65% (meaning that the Hispanic population was likely between\n30% and 47%, with 5% being other).\n\f28      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nsignificant disparity (29%) between the median income of\nYuma households headed by Hispanics and Whites.\n\n    Based upon these facts, Developers assert that the City’s\ndenial of their application to build moderately priced housing\nwill have a disproportionate effect on Hispanics. Developers’\nallegations, accepted as true, support the inference that “the\n[City’s] decision does arguably bear more heavily on racial\nminorities.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 269. Drawing all\ninferences in Developers’ favor, these allegations\ndemonstrate a historical background of stratification by race\nand class, indicating the City’s denial of Developers’\napplication to build moderately priced housing will have a\ndisparate impact on Hispanics by denying them affordable\nopportunities to move into communities long dominated by\nmore affluent Whites.\n\n    Developers also allege facts suggesting a prior history of\nanimus in Yuma housing developments. Specifically, they\nallege facts reported in the 2002 Analysis of Impediments\ndemonstrating a history of NIMBY opposition to the\ndevelopment of affordable housing developments and\nappearing to link such opposition at least in part to animus,\nbecause the reports’ authors include among their\nrecommendations that the City collaborate on community\nevents celebrating cultural diversity. This further supports\nDevelopers’ claims that animus helped motivate the\ncommunity opposition leading to the City Council’s decision\nto deny their zoning application.\n\n    Citing the Seventh Circuit’s decision on remand in\nArlington Heights and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nHuntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P., the City argues that the facts\nbefore us fail to demonstrate an intent to discriminate because\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA               29\n\nthey fall short of the facts in cases finding an intent to\ndiscriminate in municipalities with a long history of\ncompletely barring certain types of housing or restricting its\ndevelopment to only certain locations. See Metro. Hous. Dev.\nCorp. v. Vill. of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1294 (7th\nCir. 1977); Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Huntington,\n844 F.2d 926, 928 (2d Cir. 1988). That the facts alleged here\nare not as egregious as the facts in other cases in which\nplaintiffs prevailed is of no consequence. Developers need\nnot demonstrate a complete absence of desired housing for\nHispanics to prevail; discriminatory zoning practices violate\nthe FHA even if they only “contribute to ‘mak[ing]\nunavailable or deny[ing] housing’” to protected individuals.\nPac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at 1157 (quoting City of\nEdmonds v. Wash. State Bldg. Code Council, 18 F.3d 802,\n805 (9th Cir. 1994) (alterations in original) (emphasis\nadded)). Moreover, at this stage of the proceedings all\ninferences must be drawn in the plaintiffs’ favor and those\ninferences alone are sufficient to preclude dismissal of the\nclaims regarding disparate treatment.\n\n                       D. Conclusion\n\n    After public hearings filled with what a reasonable jury\ncould interpret to be racially tinged code words, the City\nCouncil denied Developers’ rezoning request, overriding the\nunanimous vote of the planning commission and denying a\nrezoning request for the first time in three years. For the\nreasons explained above, we hold that Developers’ complaint\nsufficiently alleges claims of disparate treatment under the\nFHA and Equal Protection Clause. We hold that the claims\nof disparate treatment are, on the basis of the complaint\nbefore us, plausible and therefore reverse the district court’s\ndismissal of these claims.\n\f30        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\n                  III. Disparate-Impact Claim\n\n    Developers next assert that the district court erred in\ngranting the City’s first summary judgment motion as to the\nclaim that the denial of the zoning request caused a disparate\nimpact on Hispanics. The motion was granted on the sole\nground raised by the City: similarly-priced housing was\navailable elsewhere in Southeast Yuma; therefore, no\ndisparate impact could be established.10 We reject that\nground and hold that when a developer seeks to rezone land\nto permit the construction of housing that is more affordable,\na city cannot defeat a showing of disparate impact on a\nminority group by simply stating that other similarly-priced\nand similarly-modelled housing is available in the general\narea.11\n\n                                    A.\n\n   Developers presented a request to the City to change the\nzoning of their land from lower-density to higher-density\nhousing. They did so mainly for financial reasons—lower-\ndensity housing was not selling after a recession, and they\n\n  10\n     Alternative housing elsewhere in the area was the only ground on\nwhich the district court relied in granting summary judgment on this\nclaim. The Developers, however, had an additional claim of disparate\nimpact based on a perpetuation-of-segregation theory. As discussed\nbelow, the district court granted summary judgment on the perpetuation-\nof-segregation claim for the reason that undisputed statistics showed that\nthe denial of the zoning application would not have a significant\nsegregative effect on the neighborhood. We affirm that ruling, infra at 38.\n     11\n      We do not address arguments in the second summary judgment\nmotion, including the City’s contention that Developers have failed to\nproffer statistical evidence demonstrating a substantial disparate impact\nresulting from the zoning denial.\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA               31\n\nbelieved that higher-density units might sell more easily. The\nCity argued in its first summary judgment motion only that\nthe availability of similarly-priced and modelled housing in\nother parts of Southeast Yuma necessitated summary\njudgment in its favor. Developers’ statistics demonstrating\nthat Hispanics would be more likely to buy homes in the\nzoned area if the proposed higher-density zoning were\napproved were not at issue. The City, therefore, had a choice\nof two alternatives, each of which was permissible under its\nGeneral Plan; one would enable more minority group\nmembers to purchase homes in an area with a white majority\npopulation than would the other. It chose the other.\n\n    As noted above, in the 1960s and earlier, national, state,\nand local governments had explicit or implicit policies that\nprevented integration even when developers had an economic\nrationale for wanting to build more dense or more affordable\nhousing. In Texas Department of Housing, the Supreme\nCourt emphasized that disparate-impact liability was\ndesigned to reverse this pattern by allowing “private\ndevelopers to vindicate the FHA’s objectives and to protect\ntheir property rights by stopping municipalities from\nenforcing arbitrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances\nbarring the construction of certain types of housing units.”\n135 S. Ct. at 2522. Indeed, the wisdom of disparate-impact\nliability under the FHA is that it addresses local government’s\n(as well as other government’s) historical racism and the\ncontinuing persistence of housing segregation not by\ninterjecting racial quotas as the end goal of municipal zoning\ndecisions, but rather by ensuring that municipalities making\nsuch decisions will base them on legitimate objectives rather\nthan on discriminatory reasons, conscious or otherwise.\nMoreover, when such decisions may still cause a disparate\nimpact, the municipality and the developer are instructed to\n\f32       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nattempt to minimize that impact by determining whether there\nis an alternative that accommodates both the city’s legitimate\nobjective and the developer’s legitimate goals. See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.500 (describing this process under the FHA). Such a\nthoughtful consideration, under disparate-impact analysis, of\nhow a city’s legitimate rationales may be reconciled with the\ndesires of developers to build higher-density affordable\nhousing has helped to change the old patterns prevalent in the\n1960s and will continue to help produce a fairer and more just\nsociety.\n\n                                   B.\n\n    Adopting the district court’s holding, which it arrived at\nwithout the benefit of the Supreme Court’s decision in Texas\nDepartment of Housing, would prematurely cut short the\ncarefully constructed mode of analysis that the Court just\nrecently established. Relying on Hallmark Developers, Inc.\nv. Fulton County, 466 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir. 2006), a case\ndecided almost ten years before Texas Department of\nHousing, the district court held that an adequate supply of\ncomparable housing in a quadrant of the City in which the\nzone is located negated the possibility of any disparate impact\nfrom the City’s denial of Developers’ application.12\n\n    In Hallmark, a Georgia county denied the developer’s\napplication to rezone land to build a mixed-use development\nincluding affordable housing, and the developer sued.\n\n\n  12\n    We assume that the Eleventh Circuit, like the district court, would\nreach a different decision than it did in Hallmark with the benefit of the\nSupreme Court’s recent Texas Department of Housing decision. In fact,\nwe are not aware of any Eleventh Circuit case that has relied on\nHallmark’s rule on alternative housing since that decision.\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                33\n\n466 F.3d at 1279, 1282. The developer’s expert testified that\nthe denial of zoning that would have allowed the construction\nof lower-cost housing had a disparate impact on minorities\nbased on data of local home ownership and apartment rentals.\nId. at 1282. Despite these statistics, the Eleventh Circuit held\nthat the developer had failed to establish a disparate impact\nbecause there was an oversupply of homes in the developer’s\nprojected price range in the southern part of the county. Id.\nat 1287; see also Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton Cty.,\nGa., 386 F. Supp. 2d 1369, 1378 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (describing\nthe “South Fulton County” area). The court reasoned that\n“[i]f there is a glut in the market of homes in Hallmark’s\nprojected price range, the lack of Hallmark’s particular\ndevelopment is not likely to have an impact on anyone, let\nalone adversely affect one group disproportionately.” Id.\n\n    The district court adopted Hallmark’s reasoning, finding\nthat “it is undisputed there was a supply of R-1-6 lots and\naffordable to moderately priced homes available in the\nsoutheast portion of Yuma at the time of the zoning denial\nand a couple year[s] thereafter,” including some lots within\ntwo miles of the proposed development in the same price\nrange and featuring the same type of homes. Citing\nHallmark, the district court concluded that an adequate\nsupply of comparably-priced and similarly-modelled homes\nin the area—that is, Southeast Yuma—foreclosed the\npossibility of any adverse impact resulting from the City’s\ndenial of Developers’ zoning application, thereby precluding\nDevelopers from pursuing a disparate-impact claim.\n\n    We disagree. The availability of similar housing well\noutside of the zoned property does not affect the analysis\nwhether a city’s rejection of a zoning request caused a\ndisparate impact by preventing a higher percentage of\n\f34      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nminority group members from purchasing homes. See Texas\nDep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. In fact, the Hallmark\nreasoning would threaten the very purpose of the FHA. A\nlocal government could deny a developer’s request to\nconstruct higher-density housing that more members of\nminority groups could purchase, as long as there was other\nsimilarly-priced and modelled housing anywhere within a\nquadrant of a city or the southern or northern part of a county.\nIndeed, there is no necessary limit to the Hallmark theory that\nsimilarly-priced and modelled housing located elsewhere\nwould preclude a finding that zoning decisions had an\nadverse impact on members of minority groups. It would\npermit cities to block legitimate housing projects that have\nthe by-product of increasing integration simply by scouring\nlarge swaths of a city for housing in another part of town that\nis largely populated by minority residents, that does not\ncompare in any number of respects to the neighborhood in\nwhich the developer has sought rezoning, or that is, in fact,\nfar less desirable in general. The Hallmark rule ignores the\nfact that neighborhoods change from mile to mile, if not from\nblock to block, and thereby overlooks the potential for the\npurposeful creation of majority areas from which minorities\nmay be excluded or of minority areas with few, if any, white\nhomeowners. Such segregated areas, when based on\nconsciously or unconsciously biased decisions that\ndisproportionately, and needlessly, adversely affect\nminorities, are the antithesis of what the Fair Housing Act\nstands for. See Texas Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522.\n\n    Similar to the Eleventh Circuit’s designation of the entire\nsouthern part of a county as the relevant unit for determining\nwhether comparable housing existed, the district court here\nalso considered far too broad an area—an area covering an\nentire quadrant of the city of Yuma—when determining\n\f          AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                           35\n\nwhether comparable housing exists. For any family,\nincluding those of potential purchasers of homes in the\nproposed housing development, housing that is a fair distance\naway from where the family would otherwise choose to live\ncannot in all likelihood be described as comparable.13 In\nother words, minority families that might want to purchase\nhomes in the zoned area would almost certainly be adversely\naffected by the denial of the zoning application if the\nexistence of available housing in a distant neighborhood were\ndeemed dispositive.\n\n    Our rejection of the Hallmark rule does not mean that the\nexistence of available housing in close proximity is irrelevant\nto determining whether a plaintiff proves a disparate impact.\nIndeed, if a city shows that truly comparable housing is\navailable in close proximity to a proposed development, such\na showing would be a relevant factor in deciding whether its\nzoning decision had a disparate impact in that circumstance.\nTruly comparable housing, however, is not simply a question\nof price and model, but also of the factors that determine the\ndesirability of particular locations—factors such as similarly\nor better performing schools, comparable infrastructure,\nconvenience of public transportation, availability of amenities\n\n\n  13\n     The City contended at oral argument that such a rule is permissible\nbecause Developers conceded that any housing at the same price as the\nproposed development in the whole Southeast quadrant of Yuma would\nbe “similar housing.” Not so. Although Developers’ complaint and\nsummary judgment briefing noted that Southeast Yuma had been\nhistorically segregated, Developers do not assert that all housing in the\nsame price range in Southeast Yuma would be equivalent. In fact,\nDevelopers spent several pages of their summary judgment brief\nemphasizing that other available housing in Southeast Yuma that the\ndistrict court cited was, for example, in a “different, less desirable part of\nYuma.”\n\f36      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nsuch as public parks and community athletic facilities, access\nto grocery or drug stores, as well as equal or lower crime\nlevels. See Clark v. Universal Builders, Inc., 501 F.2d 324,\n335 (7th Cir. 1974) (finding homes comparable that “were\nlocated in close geographical proximity to plaintiffs’ homes\nand had similar communal amenities such as transportation,\nschools, churches, and quality of neighborhood”). Thus, in\norder to determine whether housing outside of the zoned area\nis comparable, we must determine not only the close\nproximity of such housing to that area but also the principal\ncharacteristics of the neighborhood that affect families’\neveryday lives.\n\n    Rejecting the Eleventh Circuit’s and the district court’s\napproach does not, as the district court contended,\n“effectively place an affirmative duty on governing bodies to\napprove all re-zoning applications wherein a developer\nsought to build housing within a particular price range.” In\naddition to mischaracterizing the Developers’ contention, this\nstatement misapprehends the applicable law. First, it may be\nthat Developers have, in fact, failed to show a disparate\nimpact on minorities resulting from denial of the rezoning\napplication—as noted, we remand to the district court to\nassess the arguments advanced by the City in the second\nmotion for summary judgment. Second, a developer’s ability\nto show disparate impact does not impose a duty on a\nmunicipality to approve all zoning applications in a particular\nprice range. Instead, as the Supreme Court made clear in\nTexas Department of Housing, such a showing merely\nrequires the city to demonstrate that the action that creates an\nadverse effect on minorities is supported by adequate\njustification. 135 S. Ct. at 2522 (“An important and\nappropriate means of ensuring that disparate-impact liability\nis properly limited is to give housing authorities and private\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                 37\n\ndevelopers leeway to state and explain the valid interest\nserved by their policies.”); see also 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)\n(setting forth burden-shifting framework for disparate-impact\nclaims under the FHA).\n\n    Indeed, municipalities that have good cause for denying\nzoning changes may do so, unless motivated by conscious or\nunconscious racial bias. When the developer shows by\nstatistical data that a zoning denial will have a disparate\nimpact on minorities, the city’s obligation is to establish a\nlegitimate and credible basis for its decision. This is not an\nunreasonable burden. In fact it is\n\n        a feature of the FHA’s programming, not a\n        bug. . . . We need not be concerned that this\n        approach is too expansive because the\n        establishment of a prima facie case, by itself,\n        is not enough to establish liability under the\n        FHA. It simply results in a more searching\n        inquiry into the defendant’s motivations—\n        precisely the sort of inquiry required to ensure\n        that the government does not deprive people\n        of housing “because of race.”\n\nMt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc. v. Twp. of Mount\nHolly, 658 F.3d 375, 385 (3d Cir. 2011); see also Graoch\nAssocs. # 33, L.P. v. Louisville/Jefferson Cty. Metro Human\nRel. Comm’n, 508 F.3d 366, 374 (6th Cir. 2007) (“Of course,\nnot every housing practice that has a disparate impact is\nillegal.”); Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 558 F.2d at 1290. In\nsome cases, nonetheless, an adjustment or accommodation\ncan still be made that will allow both interests to be satisfied.\nCf. 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(3).\n\f38      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\n    In sum, we decline to follow Hallmark and reject the\ndistrict court’s determination that the availability of similarly-\npriced and modelled housing in the same quadrant of the City\nas the zoned property prevents Developers from showing a\ndisparate impact. We therefore reverse in part the district\ncourt’s grant of the City’s first motion for summary judgment\nand vacate its decision that the second motion is moot. On\nremand, the district court may consider the second motion.\nThe parties may, of course, amend their claims as to this\nmotion so as to take into account this opinion and the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Texas Department of Housing as\nwell as any statistical data or other law that may be relevant,\nincluding additional data regarding comparable housing in\nclose proximity to the proposed development.\n\n    Finally, Developers also raised a separate perpetuation-of-\nsegregation claim of disparate impact. We agree with the\ndistrict court that they failed to set forth sufficient facts for\nany such claim. The district court need not address it on\nremand.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s\ndismissal of the Developers’ disparate-treatment claims under\nthe FHA and the Equal Protection Clause and its grant of the\nCity’s first summary judgment motion on the disparate-\nimpact on Hispanics claim. We remand the case to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion, including its consideration in the first instance of the\n\f       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA           39\n\narguments the City presents in its second summary judgment\nmotion, as that motion may be amended.\n\n  REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND\nREMANDED.\n\f",

The panel noted that the\nCity Council denied plaintiffs’ request for rezoning despite\nthe advice of its own experts to the contrary and in the\ncontext of what a reasonable jury could interpret as racially\ncharged opposition by Yuma residents.

It strikes at the heart of the persistent racism that so\ndeeply troubles our Nation. Here, we deal with one aspect of\nthat law: zoning or rezoning of land as it affects the\n\f4       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nconstruction of housing that may be affordable by significant\nnumbers of members of minority groups.\n\n    Plaintiffs, two real estate developers (“Developers”),\nbring this case against the City of Yuma, contending that the\nCity’s refusal to rezone land to permit higher-density\ndevelopment violated, among other things, the Equal\nProtection Clause of the United States Constitution and the\nfederal Fair Housing Act (FHA). In particular, Developers\nmaintain that the City’s refusal stemmed from intentional\ndiscrimination against Hispanics and created a disparate\nimpact because the denial disproportionately deprives\nHispanic residents of housing opportunities and perpetuates\nsegregation. The district court first dismissed Developers’\nEqual Protection and FHA disparate-treatment claims under\nRule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and denied\nDevelopers’ motion for leave to file a Second Amended\nComplaint. It then granted summary judgment in favor of the\nCity on Developers’ disparate-impact claim, rejecting both\ntheories on which Developers relied.\n\n     Taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true, we\nfirst hold that Developers presented plausible claims for relief\nfor disparate treatment under the FHA and under the Equal\nProtection Clause. The City Council denied Developers’\nrequest for rezoning despite the advice of its own experts to\nthe contrary and in the context of what a reasonable jury\ncould interpret as racially charged opposition by Yuma\nresidents. This was the only request for rezoning that the City\nhad denied in the last three years or of the last 76\napplications. We reverse the district court because it failed to\ngive sufficient weight to the City Council’s alleged\ncapitulation to the animus of the development’s opponents, in\nthe face of the City’s own expert’s recommendation to\n\f         AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                           5\n\napprove the request and its practice of generally granting\nthese requests. Given these circumstances, the complaint\npasses the plausibility bar. We remand to the district court on\nthese claims.\n\n    We also reverse and remand the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the City on Developers’\ndisparate-impact claim and vacate its denial of the second\nsummary judgment motion as moot. We reject the district\ncourt’s view that other similarly-priced and similarly-\nmodelled housing available elsewhere necessarily precluded\na finding that there was a disparate impact. We remand for\nthe district court to address the City’s second motion for\nsummary judgment in the first instance.1\n\n                          JURISDICTION\n\n   The district court had jurisdiction over Developers’\n§ 1983 claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 and over\nDevelopers’ FHA claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

Through Developers and other\naffiliated companies, members of the Hall family have\ndeveloped various affordable and moderately priced housing\nprojects in Yuma. Thus, Developers are sometimes referred\nto as “Hall” or “Hall Construction.” Developers allege that\neven though the Hall family’s affiliated companies build a\nfull range of housing products, they nevertheless have a\nreputation as a developer of Hispanic neighborhoods based\nupon their development of several affordable housing projects\nin Yuma in which the majority of homes were sold to\nHispanics.\n\n    Avenue 6E owned 42 acres of undeveloped land in\nsoutheastern Yuma (the “Property”), and granted Saguaro an\noption to purchase the Property for the purpose of developing\na “moderately priced” housing project. As Developers state\nin their opening brief on appeal, their references to their\nproposed development as “affordable” and “moderately\npriced” are descriptive only and do not imply that such\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                7\n\nprojects are considered “affordable” as defined by the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nDevelopers allege that the City denied a requested zoning\nchange in September 2008 in response to animus by\nneighbors of the proposed development who wished to\nprevent the development of a heavily Hispanic neighborhood\nadjacent to their subdivisions, in which 75% of the population\nwas White.\n\n    Between 2002 and 2010, the City performed two\nanalyses—specifically, the Consolidated Plan and Analysis\nof Impediments to Fair Housing Choice for 2002, as well as\na 2007 version by the same name (respectively, the “2002\nAnalysis of Impediments” and the “2007 Analysis of\nImpediments”)—each showing that the Hispanic population\nin Yuma was concentrated in several areas in the northern,\nwestern, and central portions of the City. The analyses show\nthat substantially all of the available low- to moderate-income\nhousing was located in those areas, and that more than 75%\nof the households in that housing were Hispanic. The reports\nfound that, by contrast, Whites were concentrated in separate\nareas in the northwest and southeast of Yuma in which they\ncomprised more than 75% of the population. The Property is\non the western boundary of what was, at that time, one of the\nWhite-majority areas in the Southeast portion of Yuma.\n\n    The City’s General Plan prohibits actions promoting\nracial segregation, and its 2002 Analysis of Impediments\nrecognizes the need to encourage the development of more\naffordable housing choices to low- and moderate-income\ncitizens outside the areas with high concentrations of\nHispanic households. The 2002 Analysis warned, however,\nthat residents had used “NIMBY” (not-in-my-backyard)\narguments to block or delay several affordable housing\n\f8      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\ndevelopments; the Analysis thus recommended an\neducational campaign to promote acceptance of affordable\nhousing, lower-income neighborhoods, and cultural diversity.\nThe General Plan acknowledges that large-lot zoning raises\nhousing costs and impairs the availability of housing\naffordable to low- and moderate-income purchasers, and\nidentifies higher-density zoning as a means for the City to\nencourage desegregation. The 2002 General Plan noted\nwealth disparities within Yuma, stating that “Hispanic,\nAfrican American and Native American households are more\nlikely to have lower income and live below the poverty line.”\n\n    The City’s General Plan designates the Property for use\nas “Low Density Residential.” This designation encompasses\ntwo permissible zoning designations: “R-1-6” zoning, which\nallows development of a residential subdivision of houses\nplaced on 6,000 square foot lots, and “R-1-8” zoning, which\nrequires the use of at least 8,000 square foot lots. In 2006,\nDevelopers purchased the Property from KDC of Yuma, LLC\n(“KDC”), another housing developer, which had previously\nrezoned the Property from agricultural use to R-1-8. The\nProperty is bordered on the south by the 38-acre “Belleza\nSubdivision,” which consists of homes on lots exceeding\n9,000 square feet; on the north by the “Country Roads”\nrecreational village, consisting of 2,500 square foot lots\nlimited to persons age 55 and over; on the west by the 80-acre\n“Terra Bella Subdivision” owned by Perricone Development\nGroup II (“Perricone”), a developer of luxury homes; and to\nthe east by a parcel the City intends to use to expand a\nwastewater facility and a municipal park.\n\n   In 2008, Developers determined that development of the\nProperty with R-1-8 zoning was no longer financially feasible\ndue to the collapse of the housing market and a corresponding\n\f       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                9\n\ndifficulty in selling 8,000 square foot lots. They determined,\nhowever, that there existed a need in Yuma for more\naffordable housing, and designed a higher-density,\nmoderately priced housing project for the Property consistent\nwith the City’s General Plan and consisting of 6,000 square\nfoot lots. Developers subsequently applied to rezone the\nProperty from R-1-8 to R-1-6. The City’s staff and in-house\nplanning experts both recommended approval of the zoning\nrequest.\n\n     Subsequently, the City Planning and Zoning Commission\nheld a public hearing on Developers’ zoning application.\nSeveral homeowners from the Belleza Subdivision wrote\nletters or spoke at the hearing objecting that Developers\n“catered” to low- to moderate-income families. They\ncomplained that the people living in “the Hall\nneighborhoods” tended to have large households, use single-\nfamily homes as multi-family dwellings, allow unattended\nchildren to roam the streets, own numerous vehicles which\nthey parked in the streets and in their yards, lack pride of\nownership, and fail to maintain their residences. These\ncharacteristics, Developers allege, coincide with a\nstereotypical description of Yuma’s Hispanic neighborhoods.\nThe Commission voted unanimously to approve the rezoning\nrequest, noting that many subdivisions with small-sized lots\nhad previously been built adjacent to large-sized lot\nsubdivisions without incident. The rezoning request was then\nforwarded to the City Council with the recommendations of\nthe Planning Staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission\nthat the request be granted.\n\n   Prior to rendering its decision, the City Council received\ncomplaints from landowners near the Property commenting\non the fact that Developers build affordable housing and\n\f10     AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\ncriticizing the proposed development in terms Developers\nallege are well-known in Yuma as descriptive of Hispanic\nneighborhoods. One landowner complained that Developers’\nproposal would create “a low cost, high crime neighborhood.”\nThe City Council held a public hearing. Several landowners\nattending the hearing brought photographs of Developers’\nTrail Estate Subdivision, in which 77% of homebuyers were\nHispanic, which they identified as an “affordable housing\nproject.” One Belleza homeowner sent the following letter\nasking the City Council to deny Developers’ rezoning\nrequest:\n\n       We as well as many other families are very\n       aware of the type of ‘homes’ and\n       ‘neighborhoods’ the ‘Hall Construction’\n       company has built in the past. If any of the\n       council members are unaware of what I am\n       referring to, I urge them to please drive\n       through the many ‘Hall’ neighborhoods in\n       particular the ones with the comparable price\n       and square footage that the Halls have\n       proposed to build next to us. After doing so I\n       ask council members to please ask themselves\n       if they would want to live around these areas\n       after having paid such a significant amount\n       for their home. . . . From my first hand\n       experience in comparing these Hall\n       subdivisions with our subdivisions\n       particularly Kerley subdivision, it is evident\n       that the Hall subdivision has a higher rate of\n       unattended juveniles roaming the streets, as\n       well as domestic violence, theft, burglaries,\n       and criminal damage/vandalism to properties.\n       It was my experience that many owners of\n\f       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA               11\n\n       these homes left juveniles unattended as well\n       as many of these homes were not single\n       family dwellings like they were designated to\n       be and instead turned into multifamily\n       dwellings which in turn led to more\n       unattended juveniles and crime. . . . We find it\n       very disappointing that we have worked very\n       hard to keep out children out of areas like this,\n       as well as worked very hard to come up with\n       the funds in order to buy the home that we\n       live in. Now we are faced with the possibility\n       that once again the Hall Construction\n       company wants to add another one of these\n       ‘subdivisions’ in Yuma.\n\nAnother landowner sent a letter to the Council stating that:\n\n       According to the US Department of Justice,\n       households with incomes of less than $75,000\n       account for 91% of all crimes nationally as\n       well as 91% of all rape, murder, assault,\n       armed robbery, etc. The type of lots and\n       houses that Hall Construction is considering\n       will be catering to this group of people. What\n       will this cost the city and county of Yuma to\n       patrol this area and how many innocent\n       victims from Belleza, Terra Bella and Tillman\n       Estates will fall victim to a predator in this\n       91% demographic?\n\nA third landowner complained that graffiti is a problem in\nsmall-home subdivisions. One Councilmember described the\nHall Companies’ subdivisions as having cars parked on the\nstreets and in yards, and asked whether the garages\n\f12       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nenvisioned for the Property would be large enough to\naccommodate pickup trucks.\n\n    Developers proposed creating a “buffer” zone of 8,000\nsquare foot lots separating the Property from the Belleza and\nTerra Bella subdivisions, with 6,000 square foot lots placed\nbetween the buffer zone and the Country Roads RV park.\nOne landowner commented that Developers’ proposal would\ncreate a smooth transition in terms of lot size, but not of\n“ownership demographics.” Reacting to the criticism of\nDevelopers’ proposal, a City Council member stated that\nsubdivisions of different densities will inevitably abut each\nother, and voiced his concern that denying Developers’\napplication on the basis of the community’s concerns would\ncreate an “unsustainable precedent” for future zoning\ndecisions.2 At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council\ndenied Developers’ rezoning request.3 This rezoning request\nwas the only one of 76 applications considered by the City\nCouncil over the preceding three years that it had rejected.\n\n              PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    Developers commenced this action in February 2009,\nalleging a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and\n\n\n 2\n   Although the Second Amended Complaint identifies the speaker as the\nYuma Mayor, Developers state in their Opening Brief that the speaker was\nin fact a member of the City Council.\n 3\n   Although not relevant to the complaint (or motion to dismiss), the City\ndisputes Developers’ account and maintains that it denied the zoning\nrequest because property owners had relied upon the pre-existing R-1-8\nzoning designation and because Developers, rather than the City, rejected\na compromise buffer-zone plan.\n\f         AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V.

In early\n2010, the district court granted the City’s motion to dismiss\nDevelopers’ disparate-treatment claims under the Equal\nProtection Clause and the FHA,4 but denied the City’s motion\nas to Developers’ disparate-impact claim under the FHA.5\nLater that year, Developers filed a motion for leave to file a\nSecond Amended Complaint, which attempted, inter alia, to\nadd additional facts, including the fact that the Developers’\nrezoning request was the only one rejected out of 76 in the\npreceding three years. The district court denied this motion\nto amend on the ground that amendment would be futile.\n\n    After completing discovery on Developers’ remaining\nclaim, the disparate-impact claim, the City filed two motions\nfor summary judgment regarding that claim. The first motion\ncontended that Developers could not prove disparate impact\nbecause there was an adequate supply of similarly priced and\nmodelled housing in the Southeast quadrant of Yuma and that\n“on this separate and distinct basis alone” summary judgment\nshould be granted. In that motion, the City proffered no other\nreason for the grant of summary judgment. Four days later,\nthe City filed the second motion, in which it contended that\n(1) Developers’ had failed to show a disparate impact on\nHispanics resulting from the denial of the rezoning\n\n\n  4\n    We refer to both the claim for intentional discrimination under the\nEqual Protection Clause and the disparate-treatment claim under the FHA\nas “disparate-treatment claims” for ease of analysis.\n 5\n   The district court also dismissed Developers’ substantive due process\nclaims under the Federal and Arizona Constitutions as well as a claim\nunder Arizona Revised Statute § 9-452-01(F), which requires that\nrezoning ordinances conform to the adopted general plan of the\nmunicipality. Developers do not appeal the dismissal of these claims.\n\f14       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V.

The district court granted the\nCity’s first summary judgment motion,6 expressly stating that\nit did not reach the issues raised by the second motion, and\nthen denied the second motion as moot.7 It entered judgment,\nholding that the adequate supply of similarly-priced and\nmodelled housing in Southeast Yuma foreclosed any finding\nof disparate impact.

By the mid-1960s, Congress had\naddressed discrimination in public accommodations and\nvoting through major legislation; yet, it had failed to tackle\ndiscrimination in housing, the area that determined millions\nof citizens’ daily life experiences, as well as who their\nneighbors would be, which schools their children would\nattend, and the general social environment in which they\nwould grow up or live. Combined with the advent of\nLevittown-like suburban developments across the country,\n“various practices . . . , sometimes with governmental\nsupport, . . . encourage[d] and maintain[ed] the separation of\nthe races,” including racially restrictive covenants,\nblockbusting, and redlining. Id. at 2515. Government policy,\nwhich promised not to change a neighborhood’s composition\nwhen constructing affordable housing, exacerbated the stark\nsegregation in America’s cities. Brief for Housing Scholars\nas Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents, Texas Dep’t of\nHous. (No. 13-1371), 9–16. Altogether, as the Kerner\nCommission warned, the nation was “moving towards two\nsocieties, one black, one white—separate and unequal.”\nTexas Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2516 (quoting Report of\nthe National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders 1\n(Kerner Commission)). It took this “grim prophecy,” and the\nsocial unrest that gripped the country following the murder of\nDr. King, for Congress to act and pass the FHA. Id. at 2516,\n2525.\n\n    The FHA declares that “it is the policy of the United\nStates to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair\nhousing throughout the United States.” 42 U.S.C. § 3601. To\nachieve this goal, the FHA renders it unlawful to, among\nother things, “make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\n\f16      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nperson because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or\nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). As relevant to this\ncase, it provides several tools to do so.\n\n    First, and most obvious, it prohibits intentional\ndiscrimination—that is, disparate treatment. A private\ndeveloper or governmental body cannot refuse to sell or rent\nhousing to someone because of that person’s race, religion,\ngender, or other protected characteristic, nor can a\ngovernment zone land or refuse to zone land out of concern\nthat minorities would enter a neighborhood. See Pac. Shores\nProps., 730 F.3d at 1157 (noting that the FHA prohibits\ndiscriminatory zoning practices). If a governmental actor\nengages in this discrimination, such conduct also violates the\nEqual Protection Clause. Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous.\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265–66 (1977) (noting, in the context of\na zoning challenge, that “[w]hen there is a proof that a\ndiscriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor” in a\ngovernment decision, judicial deference to that decision is not\njustified under the Equal Protection Clause).\n\n    Given the long history and dire consequences of\ncontinuing housing discrimination and segregation, Congress\ndid not stop at prohibiting disparate treatment alone. Indeed,\nin enacting the FHA, Congress sought “to eradicate\ndiscriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s\neconomy.” Tex. Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. To this\nend, as the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, the FHA also\nencompasses a second distinct claim of discrimination,\ndisparate impact, that forbids actions by private or\ngovernmental bodies that create a discriminatory effect upon\na protected class or perpetuate housing segregation without\nany concomitant legitimate reason. Id. at 2522. Disparate\nimpact provides a remedy in two situations that disparate\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                17\n\ntreatment may not reach. First, “[i]t permits plaintiffs to\ncounteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that\nescape easy classification.” Id.; see also Huntington Branch,\nN.A.A.C.P. v. Huntington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504640\"><a href=\"/opinion/504640/huntington-branch-national-association-for-the-advancement-of-colored/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (2d Cir. 1988)\n(noting that “clever men may easily conceal their\nmotivations” and that disparate-impact analysis is needed\nbecause “[o]ften, such [facially neutral] rules bear no relation\nto discrimination upon passage, but develop into powerful\ndiscriminatory mechanisms when applied”).              Second,\ndisparate impact not only serves to uncover unconscious or\nconsciously hidden biases, but also targets “artificial,\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers” to minority housing and\nintegration that can occur through unthinking, even if not\nmalignant, policies of developers and governmental entities.\nTex. Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. In this way, disparate\nimpact “recognize[s] that the arbitrary quality of\nthoughtlessness can be as disastrous and unfair to private\nrights and the public interest as the perversity of a willful\nscheme.” United States v. City of Black Jack, Mo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1179</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1185 (8th Cir. 1974).\n\n    Today, the policy to provide fair housing nationwide\nannounced in the FHA remains as important as ever.\n42 U.S.C. § 3601. While “many cities have become more\ndiverse” after “the passage of the [FHA] and against the\nbackdrop of disparate-impact liability in nearly every\njurisdiction,” Texas Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2525,\nhousing segregation both perpetuates and reflects this\ncountry’s basic problems regarding race relations:\neducational disparities, police-community relations, crime\nlevels, wealth inequality, and even access to basic needs such\nas clean water and clean air. In this country, the\nneighborhood in which a person is born or lives will still far\ntoo often determine his or her opportunity for success. As the\n\f18      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nSupreme Court recognized, the FHA must play a “continuing\nrole in moving the Nation toward a more integrated society”\nand a more just one. Id.\n\n    Given this context, we now turn to Developers’ claims in\nthis case.\n\n             II. Disparate-Treatment Claims\n\n    Developers first bring disparate-treatment claims under\nthe FHA and the Equal Protection Clause, alleging that the\nCity refused their request to rezone the Property because of\ndiscrimination or animus against Hispanics. The district\ncourt dismissed these claims and found the request for leave\nto amend futile, holding that Developers did not allege\nplausible claims for relief in the first or seconded amended\ncomplaints. Although Developers appeal both the dismissal\nof their first amended complaint and the district court’s denial\nof their motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,\nwe address only whether the second amended complaint\nstated a plausible claim for relief because the first and second\namended complaints were both rejected based on plausibility\nand because the second amended complaint would have\n“supersede[d] the original” if allowed. See Ramirez v. Cnty.\nof San Bernardino, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008 (9th Cir. 2015); see\nalso Dorf v.

App’x 836, 837 (10th Cir.\n2013) (ruling only on motion for leave to amend when the\nplaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the first amended\ncomplaint and the denial for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint on the basis of futility). Because the second\namended complaint contains sufficient allegations that the\nCity’s decision was driven by animus to state a plausible\nclaim for relief, we hold that the amendment was not futile\nand reverse the dismissal of the disparate-treatment claims.\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                19\n\n    Arlington Heights governs our inquiry whether it is\nplausible that, in violation of the FHA and the Equal\nProtection Clause, an “invidious discriminatory purpose was\na motivating factor” behind the City’s decision to deny the\nzoning application. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266.\nUnder Arlington Heights, a plaintiff must “‘simply produce\ndirect or circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a\ndiscriminatory reason more likely that not motivated’ the\ndefendant and that the defendant’s actions adversely affected\nthe plaintiff in some way.” Pac.

The court analyzes\nwhether a discriminatory purpose motivated the defendant by\nexamining the events leading up to the challenged decision\nand the legislative history behind it, the defendant’s departure\nfrom normal procedures or substantive conclusions, and the\nhistorical background of the decision and whether it creates\na disparate impact.

In Budnick, the\nplaintiff sought a special use permit to build a continuing-care\nretirement community and, only after the Town Council\ndenied his application, raised for the first time the contention\nthat the planned facility would serve disabled residents;\nplaintiff in his prior declarations had asserted that residents\nwould be limited to “healthy, active, independent seniors.”\nBudnick, 518 F.3d at 1112–13. This alone undercut any\nfinding of discriminatory intent by the Town Council, as the\nplaintiff failed to explain how the Town could have\ndiscriminated against residents it did not know would be\nhoused at the facility. Here, by contrast, Developers allege\nthat their reputation as developers of subdivisions favored by\nHispanics, and the general demographic trends suggesting\nthat the higher-density development they proposed would\nattract a greater number of Hispanic homebuyers, were\nknown prior to the denial of their application. Accordingly,\nhere, unlike in Budnick, community members’ opposition to\nDevelopers’ application, using language indicating animus\ntoward a protected class, provides circumstantial evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent by the City.\n\n     The facts of Arlington Heights likewise do not support\ndefendant’s argument. In that case, the Supreme Court\naffirmed the district court’s finding following a trial that,\nalthough some opponents of plaintiffs’ requested zoning\nchange might have been motivated by opposition to minority\ngroups, the evidence did not warrant the conclusion that this\nmotivated defendants. 429 U.S. at 269–70. Unlike this case,\nthe Supreme Court in Arlington Heights was required to\nreview the district court’s factual finding for clear error after\na trial, while here we must accept Developers’ allegations as\ntrue and review the district court’s order de novo.

Moreover, other facts\nnot similar to any before the district court on the present\nmotion to dismiss supported the district court’s factual\nfinding in Arlington Heights. For example, as the Supreme\nCourt noted, the area surrounding the site of the desired\nzoning change to permit high-density zoning had been zoned\nfor single-family homes for more than a decade, and the\nzoning change would have been contrary to a “buffer policy”\nconsistently applied in prior instances. 429 U.S. at 269.\nHere, by contrast, the R-1-6 zoning sought by Developers\nwas entirely consistent with the City’s General Plan.\n\n    Although the relevant cases clearly hold that a city’s\ndenial of a zoning change following discriminatory\nstatements by members of the public supports a claim of\ndiscriminatory intent, the question remains whether the\nstatements alleged in Developers’ Second Amended\nComplaint actually constituted animus. None of the alleged\nstatements expressly refers to race or national origin; rather,\nthey raise various concerns about issues including large\nfamilies, unattended children, parking, and crime. We have\nheld, however, that the use of “code words” may demonstrate\ndiscriminatory intent. Galdamez v.

CITY OF YUMA\n\n     Here, construing the allegations in the complaint in favor\nof plaintiffs as well as drawing all inferences in their favor,\nthe alleged statements by the neighborhood opposition\nsubmitted to city officials contained such code words\nconsisting of stereotypes of Hispanics that would be well-\nunderstood in Yuma. Neighbors expressed concern that the\ntype of people living in “the Hall neighborhoods” had large\nhouseholds and used single-family homes as multi-family\ndwellings. These people, neighbors complained, own\nnumerous vehicles which they park in the streets and yards,\nfail to maintain their residences, and lack pride of ownership.\nThey also allow unattended children to roam the streets (what\nsome may call letting children play in the neighborhood).\nSeveral landowners attending the public hearing even brought\npictures of another Hall subdivision, in which 77% of the\nhomebuyers are Hispanic, to exemplify the complaints they\nhad about the potential new development.

CITY OF YUMA                 25\n\n    Taken together, these allegations, along with the\nallegation that Developers are known to many as a developer\nof Hispanic neighborhoods on the basis of their housing\nprojects in Yuma, provide plausible circumstantial evidence\nthat community opposition to Developers’ proposed\ndevelopment was motivated in part by animus, and that the\nCity Council was fully aware of these concerns when it took\nthe highly unusual step of acceding to the opposition and\noverruling the recommendations of its zoning commission\nand planning staff.\n\n  B.

In denying the rezoning, the City Council’s\ndecision ran contrary to the unanimous recommendation\nprovided by the City’s Planning and Zoning Commission, as\nwell as the recommendation of City planning staff.

Drawing all reasonable\ninferences in Developers’ favor, the City’s singling out of\ntheir zoning request for denial supports Developers’\ncontention that the City had a discriminatory intent.\n\nC. Disparate Impact and the Historical Background of\n                    the Decision\n\n    The complaint’s statistics on the disparate impact caused\nby the decision and the historical background of the decision\nalso tend to make the disparate-treatment claims plausible.\n\f         AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                        27\n\n    Developers allege specific facts demonstrating city\nofficials’ awareness that the effect of their denial of\nDevelopers’ application would “bear[] more heavily on one\nrace than another” in light of historical patterns of segregation\nby race and class.8          Specifically, they allege facts\ndemonstrating that distinct areas of the city historically have\nbeen populated, respectively, by lower class Hispanics and\nmore affluent Whites. They point to the 2002 and 2007\nAnalyses of Impediments, each of which shows that\n“substantially all of the available low- to moderate-income\nhousing” in Yuma has historically been concentrated in three\nareas of the city in which more than 75% of the households\nare Hispanic, whereas Whites have been concentrated in two\nother areas in which the White population has been more than\n75%.9 They also allege facts contained in the City’s General\nPlan and the U.S. Census identifying a direct relationship\nbetween housing density and costs, and demonstrating a\n\n\n  8\n    Even though the proposed development would not have qualified as\n“affordable” under HUD regulations, alleged facts regarding the\ndistribution of affordable housing in Yuma’s Hispanic neighborhoods help\ndemonstrate general income stratification supporting the inference that\nHispanics in Yuma are generally less affluent than Whites and would be\nmore likely to purchase homes built on the smaller lots proposed by\nDevelopers.\n   9\n     Although not relevant to our consideration of the district court’s\ndismissal of the disparate-treatment claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), new\ndata developed during the summary judgment phase showed that this\npercentage has changed in Southeast Yuma as a whole, though not\nnecessarily in any particular part of that quadrant of the City. While the\nCity’s 2002 and 2007 Analysis of Impediments noted that Southeast Yuma\nhad a White population of 75%, the 2012 version of the same report shows\nthat the White population in that area as a whole decreased to between\n48% and 65% (meaning that the Hispanic population was likely between\n30% and 47%, with 5% being other).\n\f28      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nsignificant disparity (29%) between the median income of\nYuma households headed by Hispanics and Whites.\n\n    Based upon these facts, Developers assert that the City’s\ndenial of their application to build moderately priced housing\nwill have a disproportionate effect on Hispanics. Developers’\nallegations, accepted as true, support the inference that “the\n[City’s] decision does arguably bear more heavily on racial\nminorities.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 269. Drawing all\ninferences in Developers’ favor, these allegations\ndemonstrate a historical background of stratification by race\nand class, indicating the City’s denial of Developers’\napplication to build moderately priced housing will have a\ndisparate impact on Hispanics by denying them affordable\nopportunities to move into communities long dominated by\nmore affluent Whites.\n\n    Developers also allege facts suggesting a prior history of\nanimus in Yuma housing developments. Specifically, they\nallege facts reported in the 2002 Analysis of Impediments\ndemonstrating a history of NIMBY opposition to the\ndevelopment of affordable housing developments and\nappearing to link such opposition at least in part to animus,\nbecause the reports’ authors include among their\nrecommendations that the City collaborate on community\nevents celebrating cultural diversity. This further supports\nDevelopers’ claims that animus helped motivate the\ncommunity opposition leading to the City Council’s decision\nto deny their zoning application.\n\n    Citing the Seventh Circuit’s decision on remand in\nArlington Heights and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nHuntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P., the City argues that the facts\nbefore us fail to demonstrate an intent to discriminate because\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V.

Conclusion\n\n    After public hearings filled with what a reasonable jury\ncould interpret to be racially tinged code words, the City\nCouncil denied Developers’ rezoning request, overriding the\nunanimous vote of the planning commission and denying a\nrezoning request for the first time in three years. For the\nreasons explained above, we hold that Developers’ complaint\nsufficiently alleges claims of disparate treatment under the\nFHA and Equal Protection Clause. We hold that the claims\nof disparate treatment are, on the basis of the complaint\nbefore us, plausible and therefore reverse the district court’s\ndismissal of these claims.\n\f30        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\n                  III. Disparate-Impact Claim\n\n    Developers next assert that the district court erred in\ngranting the City’s first summary judgment motion as to the\nclaim that the denial of the zoning request caused a disparate\nimpact on Hispanics. The motion was granted on the sole\nground raised by the City: similarly-priced housing was\navailable elsewhere in Southeast Yuma; therefore, no\ndisparate impact could be established.10 We reject that\nground and hold that when a developer seeks to rezone land\nto permit the construction of housing that is more affordable,\na city cannot defeat a showing of disparate impact on a\nminority group by simply stating that other similarly-priced\nand similarly-modelled housing is available in the general\narea.11\n\n                                    A.\n\n   Developers presented a request to the City to change the\nzoning of their land from lower-density to higher-density\nhousing. They did so mainly for financial reasons—lower-\ndensity housing was not selling after a recession, and they\n\n  10\n     Alternative housing elsewhere in the area was the only ground on\nwhich the district court relied in granting summary judgment on this\nclaim. The Developers, however, had an additional claim of disparate\nimpact based on a perpetuation-of-segregation theory. As discussed\nbelow, the district court granted summary judgment on the perpetuation-\nof-segregation claim for the reason that undisputed statistics showed that\nthe denial of the zoning application would not have a significant\nsegregative effect on the neighborhood. We affirm that ruling, infra at 38.\n     11\n      We do not address arguments in the second summary judgment\nmotion, including the City’s contention that Developers have failed to\nproffer statistical evidence demonstrating a substantial disparate impact\nresulting from the zoning denial.\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA               31\n\nbelieved that higher-density units might sell more easily. The\nCity argued in its first summary judgment motion only that\nthe availability of similarly-priced and modelled housing in\nother parts of Southeast Yuma necessitated summary\njudgment in its favor. Developers’ statistics demonstrating\nthat Hispanics would be more likely to buy homes in the\nzoned area if the proposed higher-density zoning were\napproved were not at issue. The City, therefore, had a choice\nof two alternatives, each of which was permissible under its\nGeneral Plan; one would enable more minority group\nmembers to purchase homes in an area with a white majority\npopulation than would the other. It chose the other.\n\n    As noted above, in the 1960s and earlier, national, state,\nand local governments had explicit or implicit policies that\nprevented integration even when developers had an economic\nrationale for wanting to build more dense or more affordable\nhousing. In Texas Department of Housing, the Supreme\nCourt emphasized that disparate-impact liability was\ndesigned to reverse this pattern by allowing “private\ndevelopers to vindicate the FHA’s objectives and to protect\ntheir property rights by stopping municipalities from\nenforcing arbitrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances\nbarring the construction of certain types of housing units.”\n135 S. Ct. at 2522. Indeed, the wisdom of disparate-impact\nliability under the FHA is that it addresses local government’s\n(as well as other government’s) historical racism and the\ncontinuing persistence of housing segregation not by\ninterjecting racial quotas as the end goal of municipal zoning\ndecisions, but rather by ensuring that municipalities making\nsuch decisions will base them on legitimate objectives rather\nthan on discriminatory reasons, conscious or otherwise.\nMoreover, when such decisions may still cause a disparate\nimpact, the municipality and the developer are instructed to\n\f32       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nattempt to minimize that impact by determining whether there\nis an alternative that accommodates both the city’s legitimate\nobjective and the developer’s legitimate goals. See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.500 (describing this process under the FHA). Such a\nthoughtful consideration, under disparate-impact analysis, of\nhow a city’s legitimate rationales may be reconciled with the\ndesires of developers to build higher-density affordable\nhousing has helped to change the old patterns prevalent in the\n1960s and will continue to help produce a fairer and more just\nsociety.\n\n                                   B.\n\n    Adopting the district court’s holding, which it arrived at\nwithout the benefit of the Supreme Court’s decision in Texas\nDepartment of Housing, would prematurely cut short the\ncarefully constructed mode of analysis that the Court just\nrecently established.

The court reasoned that\n“[i]f there is a glut in the market of homes in Hallmark’s\nprojected price range, the lack of Hallmark’s particular\ndevelopment is not likely to have an impact on anyone, let\nalone adversely affect one group disproportionately.” Id.\n\n    The district court adopted Hallmark’s reasoning, finding\nthat “it is undisputed there was a supply of R-1-6 lots and\naffordable to moderately priced homes available in the\nsoutheast portion of Yuma at the time of the zoning denial\nand a couple year[s] thereafter,” including some lots within\ntwo miles of the proposed development in the same price\nrange and featuring the same type of homes. Citing\nHallmark, the district court concluded that an adequate\nsupply of comparably-priced and similarly-modelled homes\nin the area—that is, Southeast Yuma—foreclosed the\npossibility of any adverse impact resulting from the City’s\ndenial of Developers’ zoning application, thereby precluding\nDevelopers from pursuing a disparate-impact claim.\n\n    We disagree. The availability of similar housing well\noutside of the zoned property does not affect the analysis\nwhether a city’s rejection of a zoning request caused a\ndisparate impact by preventing a higher percentage of\n\f34      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nminority group members from purchasing homes. See Texas\nDep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522. In fact, the Hallmark\nreasoning would threaten the very purpose of the FHA. A\nlocal government could deny a developer’s request to\nconstruct higher-density housing that more members of\nminority groups could purchase, as long as there was other\nsimilarly-priced and modelled housing anywhere within a\nquadrant of a city or the southern or northern part of a county.\nIndeed, there is no necessary limit to the Hallmark theory that\nsimilarly-priced and modelled housing located elsewhere\nwould preclude a finding that zoning decisions had an\nadverse impact on members of minority groups. It would\npermit cities to block legitimate housing projects that have\nthe by-product of increasing integration simply by scouring\nlarge swaths of a city for housing in another part of town that\nis largely populated by minority residents, that does not\ncompare in any number of respects to the neighborhood in\nwhich the developer has sought rezoning, or that is, in fact,\nfar less desirable in general. The Hallmark rule ignores the\nfact that neighborhoods change from mile to mile, if not from\nblock to block, and thereby overlooks the potential for the\npurposeful creation of majority areas from which minorities\nmay be excluded or of minority areas with few, if any, white\nhomeowners. Such segregated areas, when based on\nconsciously or unconsciously biased decisions that\ndisproportionately, and needlessly, adversely affect\nminorities, are the antithesis of what the Fair Housing Act\nstands for. See Texas Dep’t of Hous., 135 S. Ct. at 2522.\n\n    Similar to the Eleventh Circuit’s designation of the entire\nsouthern part of a county as the relevant unit for determining\nwhether comparable housing existed, the district court here\nalso considered far too broad an area—an area covering an\nentire quadrant of the city of Yuma—when determining\n\f          AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                           35\n\nwhether comparable housing exists. For any family,\nincluding those of potential purchasers of homes in the\nproposed housing development, housing that is a fair distance\naway from where the family would otherwise choose to live\ncannot in all likelihood be described as comparable.13 In\nother words, minority families that might want to purchase\nhomes in the zoned area would almost certainly be adversely\naffected by the denial of the zoning application if the\nexistence of available housing in a distant neighborhood were\ndeemed dispositive.\n\n    Our rejection of the Hallmark rule does not mean that the\nexistence of available housing in close proximity is irrelevant\nto determining whether a plaintiff proves a disparate impact.\nIndeed, if a city shows that truly comparable housing is\navailable in close proximity to a proposed development, such\na showing would be a relevant factor in deciding whether its\nzoning decision had a disparate impact in that circumstance.\nTruly comparable housing, however, is not simply a question\nof price and model, but also of the factors that determine the\ndesirability of particular locations—factors such as similarly\nor better performing schools, comparable infrastructure,\nconvenience of public transportation, availability of amenities\n\n\n  13\n     The City contended at oral argument that such a rule is permissible\nbecause Developers conceded that any housing at the same price as the\nproposed development in the whole Southeast quadrant of Yuma would\nbe “similar housing.” Not so. Although Developers’ complaint and\nsummary judgment briefing noted that Southeast Yuma had been\nhistorically segregated, Developers do not assert that all housing in the\nsame price range in Southeast Yuma would be equivalent. In fact,\nDevelopers spent several pages of their summary judgment brief\nemphasizing that other available housing in Southeast Yuma that the\ndistrict court cited was, for example, in a “different, less desirable part of\nYuma.”\n\f36      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\nsuch as public parks and community athletic facilities, access\nto grocery or drug stores, as well as equal or lower crime\nlevels. See Clark v. Universal Builders, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321012\"><a href=\"/opinion/321012/sidney-clark-and-julia-clark-v-universal-builders-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n335 (7th Cir. 1974) (finding homes comparable that “were\nlocated in close geographical proximity to plaintiffs’ homes\nand had similar communal amenities such as transportation,\nschools, churches, and quality of neighborhood”). Thus, in\norder to determine whether housing outside of the zoned area\nis comparable, we must determine not only the close\nproximity of such housing to that area but also the principal\ncharacteristics of the neighborhood that affect families’\neveryday lives.\n\n    Rejecting the Eleventh Circuit’s and the district court’s\napproach does not, as the district court contended,\n“effectively place an affirmative duty on governing bodies to\napprove all re-zoning applications wherein a developer\nsought to build housing within a particular price range.” In\naddition to mischaracterizing the Developers’ contention, this\nstatement misapprehends the applicable law. First, it may be\nthat Developers have, in fact, failed to show a disparate\nimpact on minorities resulting from denial of the rezoning\napplication—as noted, we remand to the district court to\nassess the arguments advanced by the City in the second\nmotion for summary judgment. Second, a developer’s ability\nto show disparate impact does not impose a duty on a\nmunicipality to approve all zoning applications in a particular\nprice range. Instead, as the Supreme Court made clear in\nTexas Department of Housing, such a showing merely\nrequires the city to demonstrate that the action that creates an\nadverse effect on minorities is supported by adequate\njustification. 135 S. Ct. at 2522 (“An important and\nappropriate means of ensuring that disparate-impact liability\nis properly limited is to give housing authorities and private\n\f        AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA                 37\n\ndevelopers leeway to state and explain the valid interest\nserved by their policies.”); see also 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)\n(setting forth burden-shifting framework for disparate-impact\nclaims under the FHA).\n\n    Indeed, municipalities that have good cause for denying\nzoning changes may do so, unless motivated by conscious or\nunconscious racial bias. When the developer shows by\nstatistical data that a zoning denial will have a disparate\nimpact on minorities, the city’s obligation is to establish a\nlegitimate and credible basis for its decision. This is not an\nunreasonable burden. In fact it is\n\n        a feature of the FHA’s programming, not a\n        bug. . . . We need not be concerned that this\n        approach is too expansive because the\n        establishment of a prima facie case, by itself,\n        is not enough to establish liability under the\n        FHA. It simply results in a more searching\n        inquiry into the defendant’s motivations—\n        precisely the sort of inquiry required to ensure\n        that the government does not deprive people\n        of housing “because of race.”\n\nMt.

In\nsome cases, nonetheless, an adjustment or accommodation\ncan still be made that will allow both interests to be satisfied.\nCf. 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(3).\n\f38      AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA\n\n    In sum, we decline to follow Hallmark and reject the\ndistrict court’s determination that the availability of similarly-\npriced and modelled housing in the same quadrant of the City\nas the zoned property prevents Developers from showing a\ndisparate impact. We therefore reverse in part the district\ncourt’s grant of the City’s first motion for summary judgment\nand vacate its decision that the second motion is moot. On\nremand, the district court may consider the second motion.\nThe parties may, of course, amend their claims as to this\nmotion so as to take into account this opinion and the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Texas Department of Housing as\nwell as any statistical data or other law that may be relevant,\nincluding additional data regarding comparable housing in\nclose proximity to the proposed development.\n\n    Finally, Developers also raised a separate perpetuation-of-\nsegregation claim of disparate impact. We agree with the\ndistrict court that they failed to set forth sufficient facts for\nany such claim. The district court need not address it on\nremand.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s\ndismissal of the Developers’ disparate-treatment claims under\nthe FHA and the Equal Protection Clause and its grant of the\nCity’s first summary judgment motion on the disparate-\nimpact on Hispanics claim. We remand the case to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion, including its consideration in the first instance of the\n\f       AVENUE 6E INVESTMENTS V. CITY OF YUMA           39\n\narguments the City presents in its second summary judgment\nmotion, as that motion may be amended.\n\n  REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND\nREMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
