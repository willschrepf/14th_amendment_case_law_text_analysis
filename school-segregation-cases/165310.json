Civil Action No. 10-0561 (JDB)\n ERIC H. HOLDER, Jr., in his official\n capacity as Attorney General of the United\n States,\n\n        Defendant.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiffs, four private citizens and a private membership association, bring a facial\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973c, and the 2006 amendments to Section 5, 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b)-(d). Section 5, as amended,\n\nprevents certain \"covered\" jurisdictions from implementing any change to voting practices or\n\nprocedures unless and until the jurisdiction demonstrates to federal authorities that the change\n\n\"neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on\n\naccount of race or color.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a).\n\n       Plaintiffs are residents of Kinston, North Carolina. In November 2008, Kinston voters\n\nadopted a referendum that would have replaced the city's current partisan electoral system with a\n\nnonpartisan system, in which anyone could run for local office and no candidate would be\n\naffiliated with any political party on the ballot. See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 14-15. Because Kinston is a\n\ncovered jurisdiction under Section 5, it submitted its proposed voting change to the Attorney\n\nGeneral for \"preclearance\" (i.e., approval) under Section 5. The Attorney General declined to\n\n                                                 1\n\fpreclear the referendum on the ground that \"elimination of party affiliation on the ballot will\n\nlikely reduce the ability of blacks to elect candidates of choice.\" Id. ¶ 19. Kinston did not seek\n\nadministrative reconsideration of the Attorney General's objection, nor did it seek a declaratory\n\njudgment from this Court authorizing the proposed electoral change. In April 2010, however,\n\nplaintiffs, proponents of the nonpartisan-election referendum, filed this action. Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat Section 5, as reauthorized and as amended in 2006, exceeds Congress's enforcement\n\nauthority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments (Count I) and that the 2006\n\namendments to Section 5 violate the nondiscrimination guarantees of the Fifth, Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments (Count II). See id. ¶¶ 1, 33-34, 36-37.\n\n       On December 20, 2010, this Court granted defendant's Motion to Dismiss [Docket Entry\n\n11] on the ground that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims. See LaRoque v. Holder,\n\n755 F. Supp. 2d 156 (D.D.C. 2010) (\"LaRoque I\"). On July 8, 2011, the D.C. Circuit reversed,\n\nconcluding that plaintiffs had standing to bring Count I and directing this Court to consider the\n\nmerits of that claim. LaRoque v. Holder, 650 F.3d 777, 793, 796 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\"LaRoque\n\nII\"). The D.C. Circuit also directed this Court to consider whether plaintiffs had standing to\n\nbring Count II, and, if so, to resolve the merits of that claim. Id. at 795-96. Shortly after the\n\nD.C. Circuit's decision, this Court decided another challenge to Section 5 brought by Shelby\n\nCounty, Alabama, in an opinion that involved some of the same issues raised here. Shelby\n\nCnty., Ala. v. Holder, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, No. 10-651, 2011 WL 4375001 (D.D.C. Sept. 21,\n\n2011). This Court concluded in Shelby County that Congress did not exceed its enforcement\n\npowers in reauthorizing Section 5's preclearance procedure in 2006. That decision resolves part\n\nof plaintiffs' Count I claim here.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f        Two of plaintiffs' remaining contentions, however, raise significant issues that have not\n\nbeen addressed in any other decision on Section 5 and the Voting Rights Act. These claims\n\nrevolve around three amendments to Section 5 that Congress enacted in 2006. 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973c(b)-(d). The three amendments made two substantive changes to the standard applied in\n\ndeciding whether a voting practice or procedure should be precleared under Section 5. Plaintiffs\n\ncontend that the 2006 amendments exceed Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth\n\nand Fifteenth Amendments -- an argument no other challenger to the reauthorization of Section 5\n\nhas raised. Plaintiffs also contend that the amendments violate the equal protection component\n\nof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the federal government's equivalent of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This appears to be the first facial\n\nchallenge to a portion of Section 5 under equal protection principles. It is perhaps startling that\n\nplaintiffs claim that Section 5, a law \"[p]raised by some as the centerpiece of the most effective\n\ncivil rights legislation ever enacted,\" is actually racially discriminatory. See Shelby County,\n\n2011 WL 4375001, at *1. Nonetheless, plaintiffs argue that Congress, in its effort to counteract\n\nyears of discrimination against minority voters, has overreached and harmed the interests of\n\nwhite voters like plaintiffs.\n\n        These two challenges call for different analyses and implicate different sets of caselaw,\n\nbut both, at bottom, ask how urgent the need for Congressional legislation was in 2006 and how\n\nwell Congress crafted the challenged legislation. Guided by the abundant Congressional record\n\nand the Supreme Court's caselaw on Congress's enforcement powers and equal protection\n\nprinciples, this Court concludes that the 2006 amendments to Section 5 are a careful solution to a\n\nvitally important problem. It therefore holds that the amendments do not violate the Constitution\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fand that plaintiffs' facial challenges must be denied.\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n                               I. History of the Voting Rights Act\n\n       The history of the Voting Rights Act, and of Section 5 in particular, was discussed at\n\nlength in this Court's opinion in Shelby County. 2011 WL 4375001, at *2-15. That history need\n\nnot be repeated in full here, but a few important points bear emphasis. The Voting Rights Act\n\n(\"the Act\" or \"the VRA\") \"was designed by Congress to banish the blight of racial discrimination\n\nin voting.\" South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 308 (1966). The Act's core prohibition\n\nagainst racial discrimination in voting is contained in Section 2, which provides that \"[n]o voting\n\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\n\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement\n\nof the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973. Section 2 and many other provisions of the Voting Rights Act are permanent and apply\n\nnationwide.\n\n       In addition to the permanent, nationwide provisions, Sections 4(b) and 5 of Act impose\n\nadditional requirements on certain \"covered\" jurisdictions. Section 4(b) determines which\n\njurisdictions qualify as \"covered.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(b). Section 5 provides that a covered\n\njurisdiction cannot make any changes to its voting qualifications, standards, practices, or\n\nprocedures unless those changes are first \"submitted to and approved by a three-judge Federal\n\nDistrict Court in Washington, D.C., or the Attorney General.\" Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No.\n\nOne v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 2509 (2009) (\"Nw. Austin II\"); see 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a).\n\n\"Preclearance\" under Section 5 will only be granted if a jurisdiction can show that its proposed\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fvoting change \"neither 'has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right\n\nto vote on account of race or color.'\" Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2509 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973c(a)). Section 5 \"shift[s] the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil\n\nto its victims,\" Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 328, by requiring covered jurisdictions to show that\n\nchanges are not discriminatory before they are enacted.\n\n       Section 5 was originally scheduled to sunset after five years, but Congress reauthorized it\n\nin 1970 (for five years), 1975 (for seven years), 1982 (for twenty-five years), and 2006 (for\n\ntwenty-five years). Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2510. During the 2006 reauthorization,\n\nCongress enacted three amendments to Section 5 that made two substantive changes to the scope\n\nof the preclearance provision. Because of the importance of those changes to this litigation, the\n\nportion of the Shelby County opinion describing the 2006 amendments is repeated in full here.\n\n       In the amendment codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(c), Congress clarified its intent with\n\nrespect to the meaning of the word \"purpose\" in Section 5 in response to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, 528 U.S. 320 (2000) (\"Bossier II\"). Section 5,\n\nby its terms, only allows a voting change to be precleared if the change \"neither has the purpose\n\nnor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\"\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a). Prior to Bossier II, this provision was interpreted to bar preclearance\n\nof voting changes that either (1) were enacted with a discriminatory purpose; or (2) had a\n\ndiscriminatory, retrogressive effect -- i.e., changes that worsened the position of minority voters\n\nrelative to the status quo. See Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 324 (explaining that a redistricting plan\n\nonly has a prohibited discriminatory \"effect\" under Section 5 if it is retrogressive); Beer v.\n\nUnited States, 425 U.S. 130, 141 (1976) (noting that \"the purpose of s[ection] 5 has always been\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fto insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that would lead to a retrogression in\n\nthe position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise\"). In Bossier II, however, the Supreme Court -- for the first time -- held that the\n\n\"purpose\" prong of Section 5 only prohibits electoral changes that are enacted with a\n\ndiscriminatory and retrogressive purpose. See 528 U.S. at 341. In other words, after Bossier II,\n\na redistricting plan that was passed for purely discriminatory reasons (such as to purposefully\n\navoid the creation of a new majority-minority district), but that was not intended to make\n\nminority voters any worse off than they had been under the preexisting plan (which, say, had no\n\nmajority-minority districts), would not run afoul of Section 5's \"purpose\" prong. See id.\n\n(holding that Section 5 \"does not prohibit preclearance of a redistricting plan with a\n\ndiscriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose\").\n\n       Bossier II thus had the effect of reading the \"purpose\" prong \"almost entirely out of\n\nSection 5.\" See House Hearing, 109th Cong. 12 (Nov. 1, 2005) (prepared statement of Mark A.\n\nPosner).1 As was the case prior to Bossier II, if a jurisdiction enacted an electoral change that\n\nreduced the ability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice, the change would be\n\ndenied preclearance under Section 5's \"effects\" prong (because it would have a retrogressive\n\neffect). Under Bossier II, then, the \"purpose\" prong would only serve as an independent bar to\n\ndiscriminatory voting changes where a jurisdiction \"intend[ed] to cause retrogression, but then,\n\nsomehow, messe[d] up and enact[ed] a voting change that [did] not actually cause retrogression\n\nto occur (the so-called 'incompetent retrogressor').\" Id.\n\n\n       1\n          For readability, the Court will use this short form for the many legislative hearings\ncited throughout this opinion. An appendix to the opinion provides the full citation for each\nhearing, along with information on where to find electronic copies of the hearings.\n\n                                                  6\n\f        In 2006, the House Judiciary Committee explained that Bossier II's limitation of the\n\n\"purpose\" prong had been inconsistent with Congress's intent that Section 5 prevent not only\n\npurposefully retrogressive discriminatory voting changes, but also those \"[v]oting changes that\n\n'purposefully' keep minority groups 'in their place.'\" See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 68.\n\nAccordingly, as part of the 2006 Amendments, Congress restored the pre-Bossier II \"purpose\"\n\nstandard by adding a provision to the statute that defined \"purpose\" in Section 5 to mean \"any\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\" See Pub. L. No. 109-246, § 5(c), 120 Stat. 577, 581 (2006); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(c) (emphasis added).\n\n         In a similar vein, Congress also responded to the Supreme Court's decision in Georgia v.\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. 461 (2003), which had altered the preexisting standard for determining\n\nwhether a voting change had a prohibited retrogressive effect under Section 5's \"effects\" prong.\n\nPrior to Georgia v. Ashcroft, the standard for assessing whether an electoral change violated the\n\nSection 5 \"effects\" test was \"'whether the ability of minority groups to participate in the political\n\nprocess and to elect their choices to office is . . . diminished . . . by the change affecting voting.'\"\n\nBeer, 425 U.S. at 141(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-196, at 60) (emphasis omitted). In Georgia v.\n\nAshcroft, however, the Court endorsed a less rigid, \"totality of the circumstances\" analysis for\n\nexamining retrogressive effects, explaining that \"any assessment of the retrogression of a\n\nminority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise depends on an examination of all\n\nthe relevant circumstances, such as the ability of minority voters to elect their candidate of\n\nchoice, the extent of the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political process, and\n\nthe feasibility of creating a nonretrogressive plan.\" 539 U.S. at 479. In reauthorizing the Act in\n\n2006, Congress expressed concern that the Georgia v. Ashcroft framework had introduced\n\n\n                                                   7\n\f\"substantial uncertainty\" into the administration of a statute that was \"specifically intended to\n\nblock persistent and shifting efforts to limit the effectiveness of minority political participation.\"\n\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 70 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Hence, in an\n\nattempt to restore the simpler, \"ability to elect\" analysis articulated in Beer, see id. at 71,\n\nCongress added new language to the Act, stating that all voting changes that diminish the ability\n\nof minorities \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice\" should be denied preclearance under\n\nSection 5. See Pub. L. No. 109-246, §§ 5(b), (d), 120 Stat. at 581; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973c(b), (d).\n\n                                    II. Challenges to Section 5\n\n        Section 4(b)'s coverage formula and Section 5's preclearance regime have been\n\nrepeatedly upheld against constitutional challenges. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 337 (upholding\n\nSection 5 after 1965 authorization); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 183 (1980)\n\n(upholding Section 5 after 1975 reauthorization); Lopez v. Monterey Cnty., 525 U.S. 266, 282-\n\n83 (1999) (upholding Section 5 after 1982 reauthorization in narrow as-applied challenge). The\n\n2006 reauthorization drew another set of constitutional challenges. Only days after the\n\nreauthorization, a municipal utility district in Texas brought suit seeking to bail out of the Act's\n\nrequirements or to challenge Section 5 on its face as \"an unconstitutional overextension of\n\nCongress's enforcement power to remedy past violations of the Fifteenth Amendment.\" See Nw.\n\nMun. Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 573 F. Supp. 2d 221, 230 (D.D.C. 2008) (\"Nw. Austin I\"),\n\nrev'd and remanded, Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. 2504 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted); see also LaRoque I, 755 F. Supp. 2d at 161 n.2 (describing procedure by which a\n\njurisdiction may \"bail out\" of Section 5 and terminate its obligation to seek preclearance for\n\nelection changes). A three-judge panel of this court found that the utility district was not eligible\n\n\n                                                   8\n\ffor bailout and that Section 5 was constitutional. Nw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 283. The\n\nutility district appealed, and the Supreme Court reversed. Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2517.\n\n        The Supreme Court avoided the constitutional question by finding that the utility district\n\nwas statutorily eligible for bailout. Id. Although the Court therefore did not decide the\n\nconstitutional question, it noted that \"the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by\n\ncurrent needs.\" Id. at 2512. In light of the unquestioned improvement in minority voter\n\nregistration and turnout since the Act's passage in 1965, the Court warned that \"[t]he Act's\n\npreclearance requirements and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional questions.\" Id. at\n\n2513.\n\n        Ten months after the Supreme Court's decision in Northwest Austin, Shelby County,\n\nAlabama filed a lawsuit challenging Section 5 on its face as beyond Congress's powers to\n\nenforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. 2011 WL 4375001, at *16-18. This Court\n\nupheld the constitutionality of Section 5, see id. at *80, and that decision is currently on appeal\n\nto the D.C. Circuit.\n\n                                  III. Kinston, North Carolina\n\n        The plaintiffs in this case filed their complaint on April 7, 2010, a few weeks before\n\nShelby County was filed. See Compl. at 13. As described in this Court's previous opinion in\n\nthis case, see LaRoque I, 755 F. Supp. 2d at 156, the present action stems from an attempt by\n\nvoters in the city of Kinston, North Carolina to alter the partisan nature of Kinston's local\n\nelection system. See Compl. ¶ 1. Currently, a prospective candidate for political office in\n\nKinston must either be the winner of a party primary or an unaffiliated candidate who obtains a\n\nsufficient number of signatures to have his or her name placed on the ballot. See id. In\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fNovember 2008, Kinston voters -- by an almost 2 to 1 margin -- passed a referendum that would\n\nhave amended the Kinston city charter to allow for nonpartisan elections, under which any\n\nindividual would be allowed to run for local political office and no candidate would be affiliated\n\nwith any political party on the ballot. See id. ¶¶ 1, 14-15.\n\n       Kinston is a political subdivision of Lenoir County, North Carolina, which is a covered\n\njurisdiction, and hence Kinston, too, is subject to the provisions of Section 5. See Compl. ¶ 16;\n\n28 C.F.R. pt. 51, 30 Fed. Reg. 9897 (Aug. 7, 1965) (Section 5 coverage determination for Lenoir\n\nCounty, North Carolina); 28 C.F.R. § 51.6 (noting that \"all political subunits within a covered\n\njurisdiction . . . are subject to the requirement of section 5\"). Rather than seek bailout under\n\nSection 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act, or a declaratory judgment from a three-judge panel of this\n\nCourt authorizing its proposed electoral change, Kinston submitted the proposed change to the\n\nAttorney General for preclearance. See Compl. ¶ 16. On August 17, 2009, the Attorney General\n\nissued a letter objecting to Kinston's proposed system of nonpartisan elections, on the ground\n\nthat the \"elimination of party affiliation on the ballot will likely reduce the ability of blacks to\n\nelect candidates of choice.\" Def.'s Mem. in Opp. to Plfs.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Opp.\")\n\n[Docket Entry 55], Statement of Facts, Ex. 2, at 2 (objection letter). As the Attorney General\n\nexplained, minority-preferred candidates in Kinston tend to be Democrats. Id. Statistical\n\nanalysis showed that such minority-preferred candidates needed a small amount of white\n\ncrossover voting to be elected, but that most white voters -- even Democrats -- would vote for a\n\nwhite Republican over a black Democrat. Id. Some white Democrats, however, \"maintain[ed]\n\nstrong party allegiance and w[ould] continue to vote along party lines, regardless of the race of\n\nthe candidate,\" often by voting a straight Democratic ticket. Id. The Attorney General found\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fthat switching to a nonpartisan election system would eliminate minority-preferred candidates'\n\nability to \"appeal to [Democratic] party loyalty\" and to benefit from straight-ticket voting. Id.\n\nHence, \"[r]emoving the partisan cue in municipal elections will, in all likelihood, eliminate the\n\nsingle factor that allows black candidates to be elected to office.\" Id. The Attorney General\n\ntherefore refused to preclear the referendum. Id. at 3. On November 16, 2009, the Kinston City\n\nCouncil voted not to seek administrative reconsideration of the Attorney General's objection or a\n\nde novo review by this Court of Kinston's proposed change to nonpartisan elections. See Def.'s\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss [Docket 11], Ex. 1, Kinston City Council Meeting Minutes, at\n\n19.\n\n       Plaintiffs then filed this suit against the Attorney General. Plaintiffs are four2 Kinston\n\nresidents who are registered voters there, as well as a private membership association, the\n\nKinston Citizens for Non-Partisan Voting (\"KCNV\"), which is \"dedicated to eliminating the use\n\nof partisan affiliation in Kinston municipal elections.\" Compl. ¶¶ 2-7. The citizen-plaintiffs all\n\nallege that they either campaigned or voted for the November 2008 referendum.

Id. ¶¶ 1, 33-34,\n\n36-37. Although plaintiffs' complaint clearly raised as-applied claims, they insisted during the\n\nfirst motions hearing in this case that they were raising only facial challenges to the statute. See\n\nLaRoque I, 755 F. Supp. 2d at 162-63; see also LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 783.\n\n       Six African-American Kinston residents, along with the North Carolina State Conference\n\nof Branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, joined the case\n\nin August 2010 as intervenors in support of the Attorney General. See Order Granting Tyson, et\n\nal.'s Mot. to Intervene [Docket Entry 24]. On December 16, 2010, this Court granted the\n\ngovernment's Motion to Dismiss, and on December 20, 2010, the Court issued a memorandum\n\norder explaining that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this challenge. [Docket Entries 41, 42.]\n\nThe Court made separate findings as to the referendum proponents, prospective candidates, and\n\nvoters. First, the Court found that the weight of caselaw holds that referendum proponents do\n\nnot suffer a concrete injury that confers standing to sue when a later action allegedly nullifies the\n\neffect of their ballot initiative. LaRoque I, 759 F. Supp. 2d at 169-73. Second, the Court found\n\nthat whether the two proposed candidates would actually run was too speculative to support\n\nstanding. Id. at 173-75. It further found that the prospective candidates had no legally protected\n\ninterest in a nonpartisan electoral system because they did not allege that partisan electoral\n\nsystems were illegal. Id. at 175-80. Third, the Court found that the voters had alleged too\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fgeneral an injury to their associational rights to support standing, and that they were not\n\nprevented from supporting the candidates of their choice. Id. at 180-82. Finally, the Court found\n\nthat holding Section 5 unconstitutional would not revive the Kinston referendum, and that\n\nplaintiffs' claims were therefore not redressable. Id. at 182-83.\n\n       Plaintiffs appealed and the D.C. Circuit reversed. Treating plaintiffs' claims as purely\n\nfacial, the D.C. Circuit addressed only whether Nix, the prospective candidate, had standing.\n\n650 F.3d at 783. As relevant here, the D.C. Circuit examined the record and found that it was\n\nnot unduly speculative that Nix would run for office. Id. at 788-89. The D.C. Circuit further\n\nfound that the passage of the referendum had granted Nix a legally protected interest in a\n\nnonpartisan election system. Id. at 786. Finally, the court explained that if Section 5 were\n\nunconstitutional, the Attorney General's actions pursuit to it would be ultra vires and void. Id. at\n\n790-91. The Attorney General's objection to the referendum would therefore be void, and the\n\nreferendum would go into effect as if the objection had never happened. Id. Hence, the D.C.\n\nCircuit concluded that Nix had standing to pursue the Count I claim that the reauthorization of\n\nSection 5 exceeded Congress's enforcement powers. Id. at 792.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit declined, however, to decide whether any plaintiff had standing to bring\n\nCount II. Id. at 793-96. The court explained that Count II raised complex standing questions\n\nthat had not been fully briefed in either the district court or the court of appeals. Id. In\n\nparticular, Count II challenged only the amendments to Section 5, and it was unclear whether a\n\nfinding that the amendments were unconstitutional would revive the referendum. Id. at 794-95.\n\nThe court of appeals further questioned whether, given that plaintiffs' equal protection challenge\n\nwas only facial, plaintiffs had \"met the requirement that litigants claiming injury from a racial\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fclassification establish that they 'personally [have been] denied equal treatment by the\n\nchallenged discriminatory conduct.'\" Id. at 795 (quoting United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737,\n\n743-44 (1995)). The court stated that\n\n       [w]ithout meaningful briefing on these issues, we are hesitant to decide plaintiffs'\n       count-two standing. Of course, we could ask for additional briefing. But that\n       would take time, and as plaintiffs' repeated requests for us to expedite this\n       litigation so that it can be resolved before the November 2011 election indicate,\n       time is of the essence. Given this, and given that plaintiffs themselves\n       characterize count two as a fallback position, see Oral Arg. Tr. at 13:2-4, 15:11-\n       15 (characterizing count two as an “alternative claim[]” that plaintiffs brought in\n       case they lose on count one), we are reluctant to consume precious time resolving\n       plaintiffs' standing to bring count two -- time the district court could instead\n       devote to considering the merits of plaintiffs' principal argument, asserted in\n       count one, that Congress's 2006 reauthorization of section 5 exceeded its\n       Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment enforcement powers.\n\n650 F.3d at 796. Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit remanded to this Court to consider the merits of\n\nCount I and whether plaintiffs had standing to pursue Count II. Id.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n                                         I. OVERVIEW\n\n       Before addressing the merits of plaintiffs' claims, the Court must address one unusual and\n\nimportant issue that has arisen in this case. When this Court originally granted defendant's\n\nMotion to Dismiss, the Court read plaintiffs' complaint as arguing that Congress had exceeded its\n\nenforcement powers in reauthorizing Section 5 (Count I), and that the 2006 amendments to\n\nSection 5 violated equal protection principles (Count II). That is, the Court saw Count I as\n\nidentical to the facial challenge raised in Shelby County and Northwest Austin, whereas Count II\n\nraised a facial challenge to the amendments under a novel equal protection theory. The D.C.\n\nCircuit's decision indicates that the court of appeals understood plaintiffs' claims the same way.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit summarized plaintiffs' claims as follows: \"Count one of plaintiffs' complaint\n\n\n                                                14\n\fcontends that section 5, as reauthorized in 2006, exceeds Congress’s Fourteenth and Fifteenth\n\nAmendment enforcement powers. Count two contends that amendments made to section 5 in\n\n2006 erect a facially unconstitutional racial-preference scheme.\" LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 780.3\n\nThe D.C. Circuit's discussion of redressability further suggests that it read Count I as a challenge\n\nto all of Section 5 and Count II as a challenge to the amendments. In evaluating whether\n\nplaintiffs had standing to bring Count II, the D.C. Circuit observed that it was unclear \"what\n\nwould happen to the Kinston referendum and the Attorney General's decision to refuse\n\npreclearance\" if plaintiffs succeeded in having the amendments -- but not the general\n\npreclearance regime -- declared unconstitutional. Id. at 794. By contrast, the D.C. Circuit\n\napparently assumed that all of Section 5 would be struck down if plaintiffs succeeded on their\n\nCount I challenge. Compare id. at 791 with id. at 794-95.\n\n       After the remand, however, plaintiffs emphasized that their Count I claim actually had\n\ntwo subparts. See Mot. Hr'g Tr. [Docket Entry 66] 5:7-20, Oct. 26, 2011. The first part --\n\nwhich, for the moment, the Court will refer to as Count I-A -- claims that the reauthorization of\n\nSection 5's preclearance regime exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under the Fourteenth\n\nand Fifteenth Amendments. Compl. ¶¶ 33-34. Count I-A is therefore similar to the claim raised\n\nin Northwest Austin and Shelby County. But a second part, or Count I-B, claims that the\n\nenactment of the 2006 amendments exceeded Congress's enforcement authority even if the\n\ngeneral preclearance regime is constitutional. Compl. ¶ 34. This claim was not raised in either\n\n       3\n           See also id. at 783 (\"Count one alleges that in reauthorizing Section 5, Congress\nexceeded its power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments because the statute 'is\nnot a rational, congruent, or proportional means to enforce [those Amendments']\nnondiscrimination requirements.' Count two contends that as a result of the amendments\nCongress made to section 5 in 2006, the section 'violates the nondiscrimination requirements of\nthe Fifth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.'\" (quoting Compl. ¶¶ 34, 36)).\n\n                                                 15\n\fNorthwest Austin or Shelby County, and was not identified by either this Court or the D.C.\n\nCircuit in the prior decisions in this case. Finally, Count II claims that the 2006 amendments to\n\nSection 5 violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment, the federal government's equivalent of the Equal Protection Clause. Compl. ¶¶ 36-\n\n37.\n\n       The Court has reviewed plaintiffs' complaint, summary judgment motion, and opposition\n\nto the government's summary judgment motion. [Docket Entries 1, 23, 59]. The Court concludes\n\nthat plaintiffs have in fact raised their two-part claim in Count I throughout this litigation\n\n(although they have not always been particularly clear about the nature of the claim), despite the\n\nfact that this Court and the D.C. Circuit did not focus on Count I-B. The existence of Count I-B,\n\nhowever, leaves this Court in an odd position in two ways.\n\n       First, this Court, along with the three-judge court that decided Northwest Austin, has\n\nalready spent hundreds of pages opining that the reauthorization of the amended Section 5 was\n\nwithin Congress's enforcement powers. Although neither the Northwest Austin opinion nor the\n\nShelby County opinion focused on the amendments to Section 5, both of those opinions\n\nimplicitly found that the amendments -- an integral part of Section 5 as enacted in 2006 --\n\nrepresented a congruent and proportional, or rational, response to the problem of discrimination\n\nin voting. This Court will not revisit its conclusion in Shelby County that long-standing, state-\n\nsponsored, intentional discrimination in voting justified the reauthorization of Section 5's general\n\npreclearance procedure. Count I-A is therefore denied for the same reasons given in Shelby\n\nCounty. But the Court will not rely on its past implicit finding that the 2006 amendments\n\nrepresent a congruent and proportional response to the problem of voting discrimination. This\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fCourt therefore must decide whether specific evidence in the record before Congress justified the\n\nenactment of the 2006 amendments.\n\n       The second odd effect of this revised understanding of plaintiffs' claims is that the Court\n\nmust reconsider the issue of Count I standing. Count I-B raises distinct standing issues from\n\nCount I-A; indeed, for standing purposes, Count I-B is more like Count II than Count I-A.\n\nAlthough the D.C. Circuit's opinion directed this Court to address the merits of Count I, the D.C.\n\nCircuit apparently did not envision a Count I decision addressing the constitutionality of only the\n\namendments. And finding only the amendments unconstitutional under Count I would raise\n\nquite different standing issues from finding all of Section 5 unconstitutional, as the D.C. Circuit\n\npointed out in its discussion of Count II. See LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 794-95. Hence, although\n\nthe D.C. Circuit's mandate directs this Court to consider the merits of Count I, the opinion as a\n\nwhole leads this Court to believe that it must first address whether plaintiffs have standing on the\n\naspect of their Count I claim that challenges only the amendments.\n\n       This opinion will therefore proceed as follows. The Court will begin by discussing\n\nwhether plaintiffs have standing to bring Count I-B, their claim that the enactment of the\n\namendments to Section 5 in 2006 exceeded Congress's enforcement powers. The Court will also\n\nconsider whether Count I-B is unripe or moot. The Court will then address the merits of Count\n\nI-B, determining whether the amendments are proper enforcement legislation under the three-\n\npart test laid out in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997). Finally, the Court will\n\nturn to Count II, plaintiffs' claim that the amendments violate the equal protection principles of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. The Court will first consider whether plaintiffs have standing to bring the\n\nclaim, then whether the claim succeeds on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f                                            II. COUNT I\n\n                                            A. Standing\n\n        Article III of the U.S. Constitution \"limits the 'judicial power' of the United States to the\n\nresolution of 'cases' and 'controversies,'\" Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Am. United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982), and the doctrine of standing\n\nserves to identify those \"'Cases' and 'Controversies' that are of the justiciable sort referred to in\n\nArticle III,\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). \"As an aspect of\n\njusticiability, the standing question is whether the plaintiff has 'alleged such a personal stake in\n\nthe outcome of the controversy' as to warrant invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to\n\njustify exercise of the court's remedial powers on his behalf.\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n\n498-99 (1975) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)); see also Sierra Club v.\n\nMorton, 405 U.S. 727, 731-32 (1972).\n\n        To establish the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\" a plaintiff must allege\n\n(1) an \"injury in fact,\" defined as \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)\n\nconcrete and particularized,\" and (b) \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\"; (2) \"a\n\ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\"; and (3) a likelihood \"that\n\nthe injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). In order for an injury to be \"concrete and\n\nparticularized,\" it must \"affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,\" so a plaintiff must\n\ndo more than raise \"a generally available grievance about government -- claiming only harm to\n\nhis and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws.\" Id. at 561 n.1,\n\n573.\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       The injury, causation, and redressability requirements will be discussed in turn.\n\nFollowing the lead of the court of appeals, this Court will primarily address whether candidate\n\nJohn Nix has standing to bring this claim. LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 792.\n\n       1. Injury\n\n       The D.C. Circuit found that Nix was injured by the operation of Section 5's general\n\npreclearance procedure -- and the resultant suspension of the nonpartisan-election referendum --\n\nin two ways. First, in a system of nonpartisan elections, Nix \"could get his name on the general-\n\nelection ballot more cheaply and easily.\" LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 783. Under Kinston's current\n\nregime, he must either win a partisan primary or collect signatures from 4% of qualified voters to\n\nbe placed on the ballot; under a nonpartisan regime, he would only need to file a candidacy\n\nnotice and pay a filing fee. Id. at 783-84. Second, Nix's chances of winning the election would\n\n\"substantially improve\" if the referendum were precleared and nonpartisan elections went into\n\neffect, because \"Democratic candidates would lose the benefit of party-line straight-ticket voting\n\nand other strategic advantages stemming from their overwhelming registered-voter advantage.\"\n\nId. at 784 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the D.C. Circuit explained, Nix\n\nhas a legally protected interest in such competitive advantages because the nonpartisan election\n\nregime would have been enacted in Kinston but for Section 5, \"which he claims is\n\nunconstitutional and thus void.\" Id. at 786.\n\n       The Court finds that Nix's injury is identical whether the challenge is to the amendments\n\nor to the preclearance procedure in general. In either case, Nix alleges that the suspension of the\n\nreferendum denied him competitive advantages to which he had a legally protected right. The\n\nquestions of causation and redressability are more complex in a challenge to only the\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\famendments, but the question of injury is not.\n\n       2. Causation\n\n       The causation question is more difficult. In plaintiffs' general challenge to Section 5, it\n\nwas clear that the operation of the preclearance regime had caused the suspension of the\n\nreferendum, and hence had caused Nix's injury. In the challenge to the amendments, however,\n\ndefendant makes several arguments as to why the amendments did not cause the suspension of\n\nthe referendum, and hence did not cause Nix's competitive injuries.\n\n       Defendant argues first that the Department of Justice did not rely at all on subsection (c)\n\n-- the subsection that provides that \"[t]he term 'purpose' in subsections (a) and (b) of this section\n\nshall include any discriminatory purpose\" -- in refusing to preclear the referendum. Def.'s Opp.\n\nat 24. The Attorney General's objection letter, which focuses entirely on retrogressive effect and\n\nnever mentions discriminatory purpose, supports defendant's arguments. See Def.'s Opp.,\n\nStatement of Facts, Ex. 2 (objection letter). There is no indication in the record that the\n\nDepartment of Justice has ever claimed that a racially discriminatory purpose motivated the\n\nreferendum; indeed, the objection letter concedes that \"the motivating factor for this change may\n\nbe partisan.\" Id. Nor have plaintiffs offered any reason to believe that the Attorney General\n\nrelied on subsection (c) in denying preclearance to the referendum. Accordingly, the Court\n\nagrees with the government that subsection (c) did not cause plaintiffs' injuries, and plaintiffs\n\ntherefore do not have standing to challenge that provision.\n\n       Subsections (b) and (d), however, govern the \"effects\" prong of Section 5, and the\n\nAttorney General denied preclearance because of the referendum's retrogressive effects. See\n\nDef.'s Opp., Statement of Facts, Ex. 2 (objection letter). The government nonetheless contends\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fthat subsections (b) and (d) did not cause plaintiffs' injuries because their application is limited to\n\nthe districting context. Def.'s Opp. at 24-25. Based on the text of the statute, the Court\n\ndisagrees. Subsection (b) provides that: \"Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or\n\nstandard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose of or will have the\n\neffect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or color . .\n\n. to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the\n\nmeaning of subsection (a) of this section.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b). Subsection (d) explains that\n\n\"[t]he purpose of subsection (b) of this section is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect\n\ntheir preferred candidates of choice.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(d). Hence, by their terms, both\n\nsubsections apply to \"[a]ny voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or\n\nprocedure with respect to voting,\" and nothing in the text limits their application to districting.\n\n        The fact that subsections (b) and (d) were meant to overrule Ashcroft, a case about a\n\ndistricting plan, does not mean that their application is limited to districting. Indeed, although\n\nthe specific considerations outlined in Ashcroft apply most naturally in the districting context, its\n\nbroader holding -- that a totality of the circumstances test rather than a singular focus on\n\nminorities' ability to elect governs preclearance of voting changes -- could be and was applied to\n\nother types of voting procedure changes, including one quite similar to the referendum at issue\n\nhere. In 2004, the Charleston County Legislative Delegation to the South Carolina General\n\nAssembly attempted to change the nonpartisan elections for the Board of Trustees of the\n\nCharleston County School District to partisan elections. See Letter from R. Alexander Acosta,\n\nAssistant Attorney General, to C. Havird Jones, Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General (Feb. 26,\n\n2004). The Attorney General denied preclearance, finding that the change would diminish\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fminorities' ability to elect their candidates of choice. Id. at 2. In doing so, he specifically noted\n\nthat he was applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test under Ashcroft, and he considered,\n\namong other things, whether minority-preferred elected officials supported the change. Id. at 1-\n\n2. Hence, Ashcroft’s broad holding did apply to changes like those at issue here, and the\n\namendments partially overruling it do as well. Indeed, a comparison of the objection letter in\n\nthis case and the objection letter in the Charleston County School District case strongly suggests\n\nthat the Attorney General applied a different standard here than he did there. Compare id. with\n\nDef.'s Opp., Statement of Facts, Ex. 2 (objection letter).\n\n       This does not end the causation inquiry, however, because the question remains whether\n\nthe Attorney General would have come to the same ultimate conclusion under the\n\nAshcroft standard. If so, the amendments did not cause plaintiffs' injury. Neither party has made\n\nany serious effort to answer or analyze that question. Under the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nFederal Election Commission v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), however, the Court believes that\n\nplaintiffs succeed on the causation prong. In Akins, plaintiffs challenged the Federal Election\n\nCommission's (\"FEC\") determination that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\n\n(\"AIPAC\") did not have to follow certain registration and disclosure rules under the Federal\n\nElection Campaign Act (\"FECA\") because AIPAC's \"major purpose\" was not nominating or\n\nelecting political candidates. Id. at 14-18. Plaintiffs sued the FEC, arguing that the \"major\n\npurpose\" test misinterpreted FECA. The Supreme Court agreed that plaintiffs' inability to obtain\n\ninformation that would otherwise have been disclosed was a concrete, particularized injury. Id.\n\nat 20-21. The FEC argued, however, that plaintiffs did not have standing because FEC's alleged\n\nmisinterpretation of FECA might not have caused their injury, given that the FEC could have --\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fand, under the evidence in the record, likely would have -- exercised its discretion to exempt\n\nAIPAC from the FECA's requirements. See id. at 25. The Supreme Court nonetheless held that\n\nplaintiffs had standing. It explained:\n\n        [W]e cannot know that the FEC would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion\n        in this way. Agencies often have discretion about whether or not to take a\n        particular action. Yet those adversely affected by a discretionary agency decision\n        generally have standing to complain that the agency based its decision upon an\n        improper legal ground. If a reviewing court agrees that the agency misinterpreted\n        the law, it will set aside the agency's action and remand the case -- even though\n        the agency (like a new jury after a mistrial) might later, in the exercise of its\n        lawful discretion, reach the same result for a different reason. Thus respondents'\n        \"injury in fact\" is \"fairly traceable\" to the FEC's decision not to issue its\n        complaint, even though the FEC might reach the same result exercising its\n        discretionary powers lawfully.\n\nId. at 25 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Here, too, plaintiffs claim that the Attorney General employed the wrong legal standard -\n\n- namely, the allegedly unconstitutional preclearance standard in subsections (b) and (d) rather\n\nthan the test laid out in Ashcroft. The fact that the Attorney General could have reached the\n\nsame result under the correct standard, as the FEC could have \"reach[ed] the same result\n\nexercising its discretionary powers lawfully,\" does not negate causation under Akins. This case\n\nis not exactly like Akins – among other things, the Attorney General's \"discretion\" to make\n\npreclearance decisions is not as broad as the FEC's authority was under FECA – but the Court\n\nsees no reason that those differences dictate a different result here. Accordingly, under Akins,\n\nthe Court holds that plaintiffs have established that subsections (b) and (d) caused their injury.\n\n        3. Redressability\n\n        Plaintiffs offer various arguments for why their injury -- the postponement of the\n\nreferendum -- will be redressed if this Court finds the 2006 amendments unconstitutional. Their\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fprimary argument is that subsections (b), (c), and (d) cannot be severed from subsection (a),\n\nwhich contains the core preclearance provision. Consol. Reply Mem. in Supp. of Plfs.' Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. & in Opp. to Def.'s and Intervenors' Mot. for Summ. J. & Intervenors' Renewed Mot.\n\nto Dismiss (\"Plfs.' Opp.\") [Docket Entry 59] at 39-44. Hence, according to plaintiffs' theory,\n\nfinding that the amendments are unconstitutional would mean that all of Section 5 must be struck\n\nas unconstitutional. Id. And, as the D.C. Circuit explained, striking Section 5 as\n\nunconstitutional would revive the referendum. This is so because if \"Section 5 is\n\nunconstitutional, the Attorney General's actions pursuant to that unconstitutional statute would\n\nbe void.\" LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 791.\n\n       Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, the Court agrees with the government that the\n\namendments are severable from subsection (a)'s general preclearance provision. When possible,\n\ncourts sever unconstitutional portions of a statute rather than striking the whole statute. Free\n\nEnter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 130 S. Ct. 3138, 3161 (2010). Severance is\n\npossible when the remaining portion of the statue is \"(1) constitutionally valid, (2) capable of\n\nfunctioning independently, and (3) 'consistent with Congress' basic objectives in enacting the\n\nstatute.'\" Def.'s Opp. at 26 (quoting United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 258-259 (2005)).\n\n\"The presence of a severability clause, which expressly sets forth congressional intent that a\n\nstatute stand in the event one of its provisions is struck down, makes it extremely difficult for a\n\nparty to demonstrate inseverability.\" Consumer Energy Council v. Fed. Energy Regulatory\n\nComm'n, 673 F.2d 425, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n\n       All three conditions are met here. Subsection (a) is constitutionally valid and capable of\n\nfunctioning without the 2006 amendments. Other than one purely stylistic change, subsection\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f(a) is the version of Section 5 that was in effect before the 2006 amendments, and that version\n\nwas upheld against numerous constitutional challenges. See Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 337; City\n\nof Rome, 446 U.S. at 183; Lopez, 525 U.S. at 282-83; see generally Shelby County, 2011 WL\n\n4375001.\n\n       The presence of a severability clause demonstrates that severing the amendments would\n\nbe \"consistent with Congress' basic objectives in enacting the statute.\" The Voting Rights Act's\n\nseverability clause provides that\n\n       [i]f any provision of [the Voting Rights Act] or the application thereof to any\n       person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of [the Voting Rights Act]\n       and the application of the provision to other persons not similarly situated or to\n       other circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973p. Accordingly, it was Congress's considered judgment that Section 5 without\n\nthe Bossier II and Ashcroft \"fixes\" was better than no Section 5 at all. Plaintiffs argue that the\n\nseverability clause has been part of the Voting Rights Act since 1965, and thus cannot speak to\n\nthe 2006 Congress's intent. But this Court must presume that Congress was aware of the clause\n\nwhen it reauthorized and amended Section 5, and that it affirmatively intended the severability\n\nclause to apply to the amendments. See Koog v. United States, 79 F.3d 452, 463 n.12 (5th Cir.\n\n1996); see also Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 686 n.8 (1987) (noting that\n\nseverability clause applies to later provisions that amend a law). Moreover, nothing in the\n\nlegislative history suggests a reason to question this presumption. Certainly, several members of\n\nCongress made clear that they thought the Bossier II and Ashcroft fixes were important, but\n\nthere was no serious discussion of whether failing to reauthorize Section 5 at all was preferable\n\nto reauthorizing Section 5 as construed by those cases. See Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137,\n\n143-144 (1996) (statements indicating that Congress preferred complete statute do not\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fundermine case for severability because \"[t]his mode of analysis, if carried out in every case,\n\nwould operate to defeat every claim of severability\").\n\n       The Court therefore concludes that each of the amendments is severable from subsection\n\n(a), the general preclearance procedure. Hence, the Court rejects plaintiffs' primary\n\nredressability argument. The question then is whether there is any other reason that finding\n\nsubsections (b) and (d) unconstitutional would redress plaintiffs' injury. The Court finds that\n\nthere is such a reason.\n\n       First, the D.C. Circuit's opinion makes clear that the Attorney General's objection would\n\nbe nullified if the amendments were struck down as unconstitutional. The D.C. Circuit explained\n\nthat if all of Section 5 is unconstitutional, the Attorney General's actions pursuant to it would be\n\nvoid. LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 791. Similarly, if the amendments are unconstitutional, the\n\nAttorney General's actions pursuant to them would be void. Although subsection (a) contains\n\nthe actual preclearance procedure, the Attorney General's actions were indeed made \"pursuant\n\nto\" subsections (b) and (d) in addition to subsection (a), because subsections (b) and (d) now\n\ndefine the key terms in subsection (a).\n\n       The question then is what would happen to the Kinston referendum if the Attorney\n\nGeneral's original objection were nullified, but Section 5's general preclearance procedure\n\nremained in place. Because the D.C. Circuit considered only the situation where Section 5 was\n\nstruck down in its entirety, it did not provide guidance on this issue. Moreover, because this is a\n\nnovel situation, neither party has identified any case on point. As a matter of logic, however, it\n\nwould seem that the referendum would have to be precleared under the pre-2006 version of\n\nSection 5 before it could go into effect. Cf. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 490 (remanding to district\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fcourt to reconsider whether districting plan could be precleared in light of standard laid out by\n\nSupreme Court). Any other course of action would lead to the anomalous result that the Kinston\n\nreferendum -- unlike every other election law -- could go into effect without ever being\n\nprecleared. Moreover, contrary to the government's view, the Court does not believe that\n\nKinston would be able to make a discretionary decision not to seek such reconsideration of the\n\nreferendum. See United States' Resp. to Plfs.' Br. Regarding Suggestion of Mootness at 3-4\n\n[Docket Entry 69]. Preclearance of the Kinston referendum under the pre-2006 version of\n\nSection 5 would not be \"reconsideration\" as that term is usually used in this context. Rather, it\n\nwould be a routine action to seek preclearance of an election change that had not yet been\n\nthrough the (proper) process.\n\n       Assuming that the referendum would have to be precleared under the pre-2006 standard,\n\nthe final question is whether it would, in fact, be precleared under that standard. If it is clear that\n\nthe referendum would not be precleared under any standard, plaintiffs' claims are not redressable\n\nand they have no standing to challenge the 2006 amendments. As with the causation prong,\n\nneither party has analyzed this issue in any detail. But, again as with the causation prong, the\n\nCourt finds this question governed by Akins. After explaining that causation was not defeated\n\nsimply because an agency that \"based its decision upon an improper legal ground\" could reach\n\nthe same decision on a proper legal ground, the Supreme Court disposed of the \"redressability\"\n\nprong in a single sentence: \"For similar reasons, the courts in this case can redress respondents'\n\ninjury in fact.\" 524 U.S. at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as in Akins, the injury is\n\nredressable because the Attorney General will have to reconsider preclearance of the referendum\n\nunder the Ashcroft standard if plaintiffs succeed, even though the Attorney General \"might later,\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fin the exercise of [his] lawful discretion, reach the same result for a different reason.\" Id.; see\n\nalso Townes v. Jarvis, 577 F.3d 543, 546-48 (4th Cir. 2009) (relying on Akins to find that habeas\n\npetitioner could challenge Parole Board's decision that allegedly violated Due Process and Equal\n\nProtection Clauses, even though Board might deny parole even applying proper standard).\n\n       The Court therefore finds that Nix has standing to challenge subsections (b) and (d), but\n\nnot subsection (c).4 For the same reasons given in its first opinion in this case, see LaRoque I,\n\n755 F. Supp. 2d at 168-73, 180-82, the Court concludes that referendum proponents do not have\n\nstanding; that the voters' allegation that their associational rights are burdened is too generalized\n\nto support standing; and that the voters are not precluded from supporting their candidates of\n\nchoice. KCNV, however, does have standing to challenge subsections (b) and (d), because it has\n\nestablished that one of its \"members would otherwise have standing to sue in [his] own right\"\n\nand \"the interests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose.\" Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n\nv. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000).\n\n       4. Effect in this case\n\n       Finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing as to subsection (c), of course, means that\n\n\n\n       4\n         Plaintiffs might also have standing to challenge the amendments as part of their\nchallenge to the general preclearance regime (Count I-A), for which they have standing.\nLaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 792. That is, plaintiffs could argue that the enactment of the general\npreclearance regime exceeds Congress's enforcement power, and that the amendments are simply\nan aspect of Congress's overreach in reauthorizing Section 5. This formulation of their argument\nis academic as to subsections (b) and (d), but could change the outcome in subsection (c). As the\nCourt reads plaintiffs' papers, however, their argument is that even if the general preclearance\nmechanism is constitutional, the substantive standard laid out in subsections (b) through (d) is\nunconstitutional. See generally Plfs.' Opp. (devoting separate sections to Count I-A, Count I-B,\nand Count II); Plfs.' Notice of Filing, Ex. 1, at 2 [Docket Entry 36] (letter to Court describing\nclaims). Because plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of the amendments separately\nfrom the entire preclearance standard, they must establish standing for that challenge. See U.S.\nEcology, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 231 F.3d 20, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n                                                  28\n\fthis Court does not have jurisdiction to find that amendment constitutional or unconstitutional on\n\nthe merits. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 559-60. However, as the D.C. Circuit explained, time is of the\n\nessence in this case, and plaintiffs have already been through one appeal and remand. LaRoque\n\nII, 650 F.3d at 795. Solely in order to obviate any possible need for another remand, and in the\n\nunusual circumstances of this case, this Court will explain how it would rule on the merits of\n\nsubsection (c) if plaintiffs could establish standing on that claim. Should the D.C. Circuit\n\ndisagree with this Court's conclusion on standing, it will then be able to address the merits\n\nimmediately.\n\n                                           B. Ripeness\n\n       The Court declines the government's invitation to find that plaintiffs' challenge is not ripe\n\nfor review. This case is not like Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296 (1998), upon which the\n\ngovernment relies. There, the state of Texas made certain changes to its educational system that\n\nhad the potential to affect voting. Id. at 298-99. The Department of Justice found that the\n\nspecific changes at issue did not affect voting and did not require preclearance, but that \"under\n\ncertain foreseeable circumstances their implementation may\" require preclearance. Id. at 299.\n\nTexas sought a declaratory judgment that Section 5 did not apply. Id. The Supreme Court found\n\nthat Texas's claim was not ripe because a long sequence of events had to occur before the\n\npreclearance issue could arise, and it might never arise. Id. at 300. Moreover, Texas had asked\n\nthe Court to hold that it was impossible for the educational changes to affect voting, and the\n\nCourt explained that \"[w]e do not have sufficient confidence in our powers of imagination to\n\naffirm such a negative.\" Id. at 301. Moreover, because Texas was currently implementing the\n\neducational changes without any impediment, the Court found that Texas would suffer no\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fhardship by deferring review until it was clear that review would be necessary. Id. at 301-02.\n\n       Here, in contrast, the Attorney General has already objected to the referendum and\n\nthereby harmed Nix's interests. This is not a case about events that might never happen.\n\nMoreover, although the parties admittedly disagree about how the statute will be applied, the\n\nCourt finds that there is sufficient information to construe the statute and make a judgment as to\n\nits facial validly. That other parties could later bring as-applied claims does not mean this facial\n\nchallenge is not ripe.\n\n                                            C. Mootness\n\n       Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that Nix planned to run for Kinston city council in\n\nNovember 2011. That election occurred during the course of this litigation. Nix lost, coming in\n\nfourth out of six candidates running for three seats. Plfs.' Br. Regarding Suggestion of Mootness\n\nat 1 [Docket Entry 67]. Plaintiffs have, however, submitted a copy of Nix's campaign website, in\n\nwhich he promises to run again in the next election in November 2013. Id., Ex. C. Plaintiffs and\n\nthe government agree that the case is therefore not moot. Because election litigation frequently\n\noutlasts election cycles, Nix's injury is of the type that is \"capable of repetition, yet evading\n\nreview.\" LaRouche v. Fowler, 152 F.3d 974, 978-79 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also LaRoque II, 650\n\nF.3d at 788. Nix is likely -- indeed, nearly certain -- to suffer the same injury in his 2013 run for\n\nKinston city council. See LaRouche, 152 F.3d at 978-79. Accordingly, the Court finds that this\n\naction is not moot.\n\n                                             D. Merits\n\n       1.    Standard of Review\n\n       The parties dispute whether the claim that Congress exceeded its enforcement power in\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fenacting the amended Section 5 should be reviewed under the rationality standard set forth in\n\nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. at 324, or under the more rigorous test laid out in City of Boerne v. Flores,\n\n521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997). This Court considered the identical issue in Shelby County. See 2011\n\nWL 4375001, at *21-34. For the reasons given there, the Court will review plaintiffs' claims\n\nunder Boerne's \"congruence and proportionality\" test.\n\n       2.   The Scope of the Constitutional Right At Issue\n\n       In determining whether the 2006 amendments are within Congress's enforcement power,\n\nthe first step under Boerne is \"to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional\n\nright at issue.\" See Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365 (2001); see\n\nalso Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004). Where a statute is designed to protect a\n\nfundamental right or to prevent discrimination based on a suspect classification, it is \"easier for\n\nCongress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations,\" as required at the second step of\n\nthe Boerne analysis. See Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 736 (2003). In\n\nother words, Congress is more likely to be able to identify unconstitutional state action justifying\n\nremedial, prophylactic enforcement legislation when it seeks to protect against discrimination\n\nbased on a classification like gender, \"which triggers heightened scrutiny,\" see Hibbs, 538 U.S.\n\nat 736, than when it seeks to protect against discrimination based on a trait such as disability,\n\nwhich \"incurs only the minimum 'rational-basis' review,\" see Garrett, 531 U.S. at 366. This is\n\nbecause \"the heightened level of constitutional scrutiny\" that accompanies a suspect\n\nclassification or a fundamental right means that \"the historical problems\" identified by Congress\n\nwith respect to that class or right are more likely to amount to constitutional violations, and a\n\nhistory of constitutional violations is a necessary predicate for the enactment of remedial\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fenforcement legislation under the Reconstruction Amendments. See Mark A. Posner, Time is\n\nStill On its Side: Why Congressional Reauthorization of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act\n\nRepresents a Congruent and Proportional Response to Our Nation's History of Discrimination in\n\nVoting, 10 N.Y.U. J. LEGIS. & PUB. POL'Y 51, 87 (2006). Hence, \"the Court gives Congress\n\nsignificant leeway to craft broad remedial prohibitions when fundamental rights or protected\n\nclasses are at stake.\" Nw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 270.\n\n       The amendments to Section 5 protect two fundamental rights. First, they seek to protect\n\nthe right to vote -- a \"fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights,\" Yick\n\nWo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). Second, they protect against discrimination based on\n\nrace, \"the classification of which we have been the most suspect,\" see M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S.\n\n102, 135 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Because Section 5 protects two of the most crucial\n\nconstitutional rights, Congress's enforcement powers are at its peak when it legislates to ensure\n\nthat voting is free from racial discrimination. See Nathaniel Persily, The Promise and Pitfalls of\n\nthe New Voting Rights Act, 117 YALE L.J. 174, 176 (2007) (hereinafter Persily, Promise and\n\nPitfalls) (explaining that Congress \"acted at the apex of its power to enforce the guarantees of the\n\npost-Civil War Amendments\" when it enacted the Voting Rights Act). Just as in Hibbs and\n\nLane, then, it is \"easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations\"\n\njustifying the need for Section 5 than when Congress seeks to enforce rights subject to lesser\n\nlevels of constitutional review, since \"racial classifications and restrictions on the right to vote -\n\nlike gender discrimination (Hibbs) and access to the courts (Lane) - are 'presumptively invalid.'\"\n\nNw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 270 (quoting Hibbs, 538 U.S. at 736).\n\n       3. Evidence of Unconstitutional Discrimination in the Legislative Record and the\n        Congruence and Proportionality of Section 5\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f       Given this definition of \"the constitutional right at issue,\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365, the\n\nnext question is whether Congress identified \"a history and pattern\" of unconstitutional, state-\n\nsponsored voting discrimination that justified the 2006 amendments to Section 5. Id. at 368. If\n\nthe Court finds that Congress has identified such a pattern, it must then consider whether the\n\nchallenged law is congruent and proportional to the identified violations. Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n\n520, 530-32. In answering these second and third Boerne inquiries, the Court will consider\n\nsubsection (c) and subsections (b) and (d) separately. Before doing so, however, one general\n\nargument plaintiffs press throughout their briefs must be addressed.\n\n               1. The expansion of the preclearance standard\n\n       Plaintiffs vehemently argue that the amendments cannot be a congruent and proportional\n\nresponse to discrimination in voting, regardless of the evidence Congress amassed during the\n\n2006 reauthorization, because \"any 2006 expansion of the 1965 preclearance standard would be\n\nunconstitutional given the dramatic improvements in the covered jurisdictions.\" Plfs.' Opp. at\n\n33. Under their argument, there is a bright-line rule that any expansion of Section 5 is now per\n\nse unconstitutional under Boerne.\n\n       The Court rejects this simplistic argument for several reasons. First, even if the\n\namendments are an expansion of Section 5's preclearance standard, that does not ipso facto make\n\nthem unconstitutional. Congress has previously expanded substantive provisions of the Voting\n\nRights Act, even in the face of unquestionably improved voting conditions, without thereby\n\nrendering the VRA unconstitutional. In 1982, for instance, Congress significantly expanded the\n\nVRA by providing that acts related to voting that were discriminatory in effect, as well as those\n\nthat were discriminatory in purpose, violated Section 2 of the Act. Presumably employing\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fKatzenbach's rationality review, the Supreme Court summarily affirmed that the post-1982\n\nSection 2 was constitutional. Miss. Republican Exec. Comm. v. Brooks, 469 U.S. 1002, 1003\n\n(1984).\n\n          Plaintiffs' bright-line argument does not make sense even as a theoretical matter.\n\nCongress has amassed substantial evidence of discrimination in voting; it therefore has a range\n\nof options for remedial legislation that would be congruent and proportional to the problem. In\n\nevaluating the 2006 reauthorization, the question before this Court is whether the legislative\n\nresponse Congress chose is within that range, not where it falls in the range relative to past\n\nlegislation. See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530-32. So long as current needs justify the current\n\nlegislation, see Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2512, it does not matter whether Congress is\n\nlegislating more or less assertively than it has in the past. This is particularly true because\n\nSection 5 now responds primarily to \"second generation\" voting problems, rather than to the\n\n\"first generation\" problem of outright denials of the vote. House Hearing, 109th Cong. 1134\n\n(Oct. 18, 2005) (Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, eds., Quiet Revolution in the South:\n\nThe Impact of the Voting Rights Act 1965-1990 14 (Princeton University Press 1994)).\n\nCongress could reasonably decide that a different preclearance standard is necessary to respond\n\nto a different set of problems, and that decision would be acceptable so long as the remedy is\n\ncongruent and proportional to the problem. Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530-32.\n\n          Theoretical arguments aside, it is not at all clear that the 2006 amendments actually\n\nrepresent an expansion to Section 5's preclearance standard. As this Court explained in the\n\nShelby County decision, \"[i]n Bossier II . . . the Supreme Court -- for the first time -- held that\n\nthe 'purpose' prong of Section 5 only prohibits electoral changes that are enacted with a\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fdiscriminatory and retrogressive purpose.\" 2011 WL 4375001, at *10. Congress added\n\nsubsection (c) to Section 5 in order to \"restore[] the pre-Bossier II 'purpose' standard.\" Id. at\n\n*11. Similarly, \"the Supreme Court's decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461 (2003) . . .\n\nhad altered the preexisting standard for determining whether a voting change had a prohibited\n\nretrogressive effect under Section 5's 'effects' prong.\" Id. Congress therefore added subsections\n\n(b) and (d) \"in an attempt to restore the simpler, 'ability to elect' analysis articulated in\" prior\n\ncaselaw. Id. This Court's understanding of the amendments as restorative was echoed by many\n\nwitnesses during the 2005 and 2006 hearings. See, e.g., Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 182 (May\n\n9, 2006) (responses of Theodore M. Shaw to questions of Sens. Specter, Cornyn, Leahy,\n\nKennedy, and Schumer); Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 149 (May 9, 2006) (responses of Laughlin\n\nMcDonald to questions of Sens. Specter, Kennedy, Schumer and Cornyn); see also House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 59 (Nov. 1, 2005) (statement of Rep. John Conyers). While there was a\n\nless universal consensus that the Ashcroft \"fix\" was a simple return to the status quo ante than\n\nthere was for the Bossier II \"fix,\" see infra at 63-64, there was also no consensus that the\n\nAshcroft \"fix\" represented an expansion -- rather than a simple change -- to the preclearance\n\nstandard. Id.\n\n        In response to this record evidence, plaintiffs argue that \"'[a] judicial construction of a\n\nstatute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision\n\nof the case giving rise to that construction.'\" Plfs.' Opp. at 33 (quoting Rivers v. Roadway\n\nExpress, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312-13 (1994)). Plaintiffs contend that the Supreme Court's\n\ndecisions in Bossier II and Ashcroft necessarily establish what section 5 always meant, and that\n\nit is therefore impossible to read the 2006 amendments as anything other than an expansion to\n\n\n\n                                                   35\n\fSection 5's preclearance standard.\n\n       The general rule is, of course, that \"statutes operate only prospectively, while judicial\n\ndecisions operate retrospectively.\" United States v. Sec. Indus. Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 79 (1982).\n\nHence, a judicial decision establishes what a statute meant as well as what it means. But in this\n\ncontext, the Court does not believe that this general rule determines the constitutionality of the\n\n2006 amendments to Section 5. Rivers explained that Congress could legislatively overrule a\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court if Congress believed the decision to be in error. 511 U.S. at 313.\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court explained, Congress \"may even, within broad constitutional bounds,\n\nmake such a change retroactive and thereby undo what it perceives to be the undesirable past\n\nconsequences of a misinterpretation of its work product.\" Id. That is, Congress has the power to\n\nlegislatively overrule the Supreme Court's determination of what the statute meant as well as the\n\nCourt's determination of what the statute means.\n\n       Here, Congress made quite clear that it disagreed with the Supreme Court's determination\n\nof what Section 5 meant, although it chose not to throw state and local election systems into\n\nchaos by making the amendments apply retroactively. In the findings accompanying the\n\nreauthorized Section 5, Congress found that \"[t]he effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965 has been significantly weakened by the United States Supreme Court in Reno v. Bossier\n\nParish II and Georgia v. Ashcroft, which have misconstrued Congress' original intent in enacting\n\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 and narrowed the protections accorded by section 5 of such act.\"\n\nPub. L. 109-246, § 2(b)(6), 120 Stat. at 578; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 2. The\n\namendments in subsections (b) through (d) were enacted \"to (1) restore the original purpose to\n\nSection 5 with respect to intentionally discriminatory voting changes; and (2) clarify the types of\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fconduct that Section 5 was intended to prevent.\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 65. The\n\nauthoritative determination of whether those amendments are constitutional is, of course,\n\nreserved to the courts. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). But as a\n\nmatter of statutory construction, Congress made clear that the amendments represented a\n\nrestoration of the proper Section 5 standard, not an expansion.\n\n       Moreover, this Court would be hesitant to invalidate the amendments in the context of\n\nthe Boerne analysis solely on the basis of the rule cited in Rivers. Under Boerne, the Court not\n\nonly reviews the law Congress has enacted and whether Congress had rational reasons for doing\n\nso, but also undertakes an in-depth analysis of how Congress arrived at its legislative\n\nconclusions. Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530-32; see also Lane, 541 U.S. at 558-59 (2004) (Scalia, J.,\n\ndissenting) (\"Under [Boerne], the courts . . . must regularly check Congress's homework to make\n\nsure that it has identified sufficient constitutional violations to make its remedy congruent and\n\nproportional.\"). Such oversight of a co-equal branch is a delicate task. See id. at 558. Given\n\nthat virtually everyone who testified before Congress described Bossier II and Ashcroft as a\n\nchange from prior law -- at least as that law had been applied by courts and the Department of\n\nJustice -- this Court is reluctant to play \"gotcha\" with Congress and invalidate the amendments\n\non the ground that they could technically represent an expansion of the statute.\n\n               2. Subsection (c)\n\n       As previously explained, the second step of the Boerne analysis is to determine whether\n\nCongress identified \"a history and pattern\" of unconstitutional, state-sponsored voting\n\ndiscrimination that justified the 2006 amendments to Section 5. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 368.\n\nThe bulk of the opinion in Shelby County -- some seventy pages -- was devoted to reviewing\n\nwhat direct and circumstantial evidence of purposeful discrimination Congress had amassed.\n\n                                                37\n\f2011 WL 4375001, at *36-64. The Court will incorporate that discussion by reference rather\n\nthan repeating it here.\n\n       The specific issue raised by plaintiffs' challenge to subsection (c) is whether, given those\n\nfindings, the amendment is a congruent and proportional response to the pattern of identified\n\nunconstitutional behavior. To answer that question, the Court will focus on the evidence\n\nCongress amassed regarding why the amendment was necessary, i.e., why the Bossier II standard\n\ncould not respond to the problem of state-sponsored voting discrimination. Hence, keeping in\n\nmind the findings of purposeful discrimination discussed in Shelby County, the Court will turn\n\nto Congressional record evidence specific to the Bossier II amendment in subsection (c).\n\n       Congress heard the testimony of numerous witnesses on the need to overrule Bossier II.\n\nAs Debo Adegbile of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund explained, \"in a very complex area of\n\nlaw[,] the problem with Bossier Parish II is very understandable to everybody, whether they be a\n\nlawyer or not, a representative or not. The problem is that the Voting Rights Act was clearly\n\nintended to stop discrimination in voting. It was most certainly intended to stop intentional\n\ndiscrimination in voting, and it was a long history of intentional discrimination that gave rise to\n\nthe Voting Rights Act.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 38 (May 4, 2006) (statement of Debo P.\n\nAdegbile). Yet, under Bossier II, voting changes that purposefully discriminated on the basis of\n\nrace had to be precleared. See Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 341 (holding that Section 5 \"does not\n\nprohibit preclearance of a redistricting plan with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive\n\npurpose\"). Drew Days, a law professor and voting rights practitioner, testified that the Bossier II\n\nstandard \"permit[ted] absurd results\" and was \"basically at war with the spirit of Section 5 in that\n\nit places a burden on those that the Act was designed to protect.\" Senate Hearing, 109th Cong.\n\n57 (May 17, 2006) (responses of Drew S. Days III to questions of Sens. Cornyn, Coburn,\n\n                                                 38\n\fKennedy, Leahy, and Schumer).\n\n       Several witnesses explained that forcing minority voters to go to the time and expense of\n\nSection 2 litigation in cases where there appeared to be intentional discrimination was highly\n\nimpractical for two reasons. First, neither the \"small and underfinanced\" voting rights bar nor\n\nthe minority communities were in a position to bear the expense of frequent litigation under\n\nSection 2. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 95 (May 16, 2006) (responses of Pamela S. Karlan to\n\nquestions of Sens. Leahy, Kennedy, Kohl, Cornyn, and Coburn). Second, in the time it took to\n\nlitigate a section 2 case, candidates who benefitted from the intentionally discriminatory voting\n\nprocedures would already be incumbents and would have all the crucial advantages of\n\nincumbency in later elections. See, e.g., House Hearing, 109th Cong. 97 (Mar. 8, 2006)\n\n(statement of Joe Rogers); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 60 (Nov. 9, 2005) (statement of Rep.\n\nTyrone L. Brooks of Georgia General Assembly). Hence, moving a large number of voting\n\nrights issues from Section 5 to Section 2 ran counter to the goal of \"shift[ing] the advantage of\n\ntime and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims.\" Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 328.\n\n       Congress also heard evidence that Bossier II, left uncorrected, would indeed force\n\npreclearance of a large number of questionable practices that could only be remedied by time-\n\nconsuming, burdensome Section 2 litigation. Richard Valelly, a co-author of Peyton McCrary,\n\nChristopher Seaman & Richard Valelly, The End of Preclearance As We Knew It: How the\n\nSupreme Court Transformed Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 11 MICH. J. RACE & L. 275\n\n(2006) (hereinafter \"End of Preclearance\"), testified before the House about the study. House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 877-922 (Oct. 18, 2005) (statement of Richard M. Valelly). According to\n\nthe End of Preclearance study, 43% of all Section 5 objections in the 1990s were based solely on\n\ndiscriminatory intent, while another 31% of objections were based at least in part on\n\n                                                39\n\fdiscriminatory intent. See End of Preclearance 297 tbl. 2. Hence, \"the intent prong was\n\ninvolved in a remarkable 74 percent of all objections in that decade.\" Id. at 298. Purpose-based\n\nobjections were particularly prevalent in the redistricting context, where nearly 90% of the\n\nJustice Department's objections to post-1990 redistricting plans were based at least in part on\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Id. at 298 tbl. 3; see also House Hearing, 109th Cong. 13-16 (Nov. 1,\n\n2005) (Posner prepared statement).\n\n       According to the End of Preclearance study, these numbers changed remarkably after the\n\nSupreme Court decided Bossier II. From the time of the Supreme Court's decision in January\n\n2000 until the end of June 2004, the Department of Justice issued 43 total objections to voting\n\nchanges, compared to 250 objections in the equivalent period during the 1990s. End of\n\nPreclearance 313-14 & n.198. Strikingly, only two of those objections were based solely on\n\nintent; 13 were based on both intent and purpose. Id. Hence, from 1990-2000, 43% of\n\nobjections were based solely on purpose and 74% were based in part on purpose. In the four and\n\na half years after Bossier II, however, 4.7% of objections were based solely on purpose and\n\n30.2% were based in part on purpose. As one of the study authors summarized, the effect of\n\nBossier II was \"sort of like dropping off a cliff.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 879 (Oct. 18,\n\n2005) (Valelly statement).\n\n       There are, of course, at least two readings of this information. One reading is that the\n\nDepartment of Justice had successfully blocked many voting changes that were intended to\n\ndiscriminate against minorities in the 1990s, but that Bossier II prevented it from doing so in the\n\n2000s, thus allowing those changes to go into practice. Alternatively, some of the Supreme\n\nCourt's opinions have made clear that some members of the Court believe that the Department of\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fJustice inappropriately relied on the purpose prong to force redistricting jurisdictions to draw the\n\nmaximum possible number of majority-minority districts. See Miller v, Johnson, 515 U.S. 900,\n\n924-25 (1995); see also Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 911-13 (1996) (\"Shaw II\"). Hence, another\n\nreading of the End of Preclearance data is that the Department of Justice was indeed relying too\n\nheavily on the purpose prong and Bossier II had the salutary effect of forcing it to cease doing\n\nso.\n\n       Congress heard considerable testimony on this question. One witness explained that he\n\nwould address it because \"if the Department badly handled this authority in the past, one could\n\nask whether it is appropriate to again give the Department that authority in the future.\" House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 882 (Oct. 18, 2005) (Posner statement). After analysis of objections\n\ninterposed by the Department in the 1990s, he concluded that the Department of Justice had\n\ngenerally followed the standard laid out in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\n\nDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), in interposing objections based on discriminatory\n\npurpose. Id. at 883; see also House Hearing, 109 Cong. 17-18 (Nov. 1, 2005) (Posner prepared\n\nstatement). Another witness agreed that the Justice Department had properly used the \"objective\n\nand workable standard\" of Arlington Heights in deciding whether to preclear voting changes\n\nunder the purpose prong. Senate Hearing, 109 Cong. 174-75, 182 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw\n\nresponses). This Court agrees with those assessments. Although reasonable people could differ\n\non the correctness of some of the objections interposed by the Department in the 1980s and\n\n1990s, the Court finds that Congress amassed sufficient evidence in 2005 and 2006 to support\n\nthe conclusion that the Justice Department had largely used the purpose prong correctly before\n\nBossier II, and that Bossier II had forced preclearance of many intentionally discriminatory\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fvoting procedures that could only be remedied by time-consuming, expensive Section 2\n\nlitigation. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 66-68.\n\n       Congress also heard testimony about discriminatory voting changes that would have been\n\nprecleared had the Department of Justice followed the Bossier II standards since the inception of\n\nSection 5. The End of Preclearance authors pointed out that under the Bossier II standard,\n\nSection 5 would have been virtually useless when it was \"'needed most,'\" because in some places\n\n\"'historical discrimination had left the number of black voters at close to zero.'\" House Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 149 (Nov. 1, 2005) (draft of End of Preclearance) (quoting Bossier II, 528 U.S. at\n\n374 (Breyer, J., dissenting)); see also Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 94 (May 16, 2006) (Karlan\n\nresponses) (elaborating on the point). As one witness explained, \"[t]he Bossier II rule actually\n\nrewards the most intransigent perpetrators of discrimination, who after decades of exclusion of\n\nminority voters and candidates, may now be able to keep the political process closed on the\n\nground that they have not abandoned their discriminatory ways. In these circumstances, under\n\nthe reasoning of Bossier II, would-be violators are not diminishing political power or access but\n\nmerely maintaining an exclusionary status quo. This scenario may aptly be characterized as\n\nperversely paying dividends for past discrimination.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 43 (May 4,\n\n2006) (Adegbile prepared statement).\n\n       The record also contained evidence of specific discriminatory changes that would have\n\ngone into effect under the Bossier II standard. For instance, several witnesses pointed out that\n\nBossier II would have required preclearance of the infamous proposed 1981 congressional\n\nredistricting in Georgia. As described in Shelby County, 2011 WL 4375001, at *51, Georgia\n\nbegan its congressional redistricting process after the 1980 census showed that the state's ten\n\n\n\n                                                42\n\fexisting districts -- all of which were majority-white with the exception of the Fifth District --\n\nhad become severely malapportioned. Under the leadership of Joe Mack Wilson, Chair of the\n\nHouse Reapportionment Committee, Georgia created a redistricting plan that maintained its nine\n\nmajority-white districts, and split the large, contiguous black population of the Atlanta\n\nmetropolitan area between the Fourth and Fifth Districts, thereby ensuring that blacks would still\n\ncomprise a majority of the Fifth District, but would only constitute 46% of the registered voters\n\nthere. See Busbee v. Smith, 549 F. Supp. 494, 498-99 (D.D.C. 1982). Because Georgia's plan\n\nincreased the percentage of blacks in the Fifth District, however, it was not retrogressive, and\n\ntherefore \"technically . . . [did] not have a discriminatory effect, as that term has been construed\n\nunder the Voting Rights Act.\" Id. at 516.\n\n        A three-judge court in this district nonetheless denied preclearance to the plan based on\n\nits conclusion that the plan had been \"the product of purposeful racial discrimination.\" See id. at\n\n516-18. In reaching this determination, the court made an express finding that \"Representative\n\nJoe Mack Wilson is a racist.\" Id. at 500. The court cited Wilson's now-infamous statement that\n\nhe did not want to draw \"nigger districts,\" id. at 501, as well as testimony from other Georgia\n\nlegislators, who conceded that they, too, had intentionally sought to \"keep the Fifth District 'as\n\nwhite as possible . . . but just within the limits . . . to satisfy the Voting Rights Act . . . .'\" Id. at\n\n515 (internal citation omitted). As one state legislator explained, \"'the motivation of the House\n\nleadership' in creating the Fifth District . . . was to 'increase [the percentage of the black\n\npopulation] just enough to say they had increased it [and] so that it would look like they had\n\nincreased it, but they knew they had not increased it enough to elect a black.\" Id. (internal\n\ncitation omitted). Another state senator admitted that he had felt obliged to vote for the plan\n\n\n\n                                                     43\n\fbecause he \"'[didn't] want to have to go home and explain why I . . . was the leader in getting a\n\nblack elected to the United States Congress.'\" Id. at 514 (internal citation omitted). These\n\n\"[o]vert racial statements,\" together with Georgia's history of racial discrimination in voting, and\n\nthe absence of any legitimate non-racial reasons for the redistricting plan, convinced the three-\n\njudge court that the plan had been enacted with a discriminatory purpose, and hence had \"'no\n\nlegitimacy at all under our Constitution or under [Section 5].'\" Id. at 517 (quoting City of\n\nRichmond v. United States, 422 U.S. 358, 378-79 (1975)). Representative John Lewis was\n\nultimately elected from the effective majority-minority district preserved by the litigation. See\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 20 (Nov. 1, 2005) (statement of Brenda Wright). Under Bossier II,\n\nhowever, this discriminatory plan could only have been contested through Section 2 litigation.\n\n       Similarly, without the proposed amendment, the Justice Department would have had to\n\npreclear Bladen County, North Carolina's 1987 attempt to change its method of election for its\n\nboard of county commissioners from at-large elections to three double-member and one at-large\n\ndistrict. Although the Justice Department found that the change would not have a retrogressive\n\neffect, it nonetheless denied preclearance to the change based on its inability to conclude \"that\n\nthe proposed election system is free from discriminatory purpose.\" 2 House Hearing, Scope,\n\n109th Cong. 1761 (Oct. 25, 2005) (appendix to statement of Bradley J. Schlozman, Copies of\n\nObjection Letters, by State, from 1980 to October 17, 2006) (hereinafter, \"Schlozman\n\nAppendix\"). According to the Justice Department, the evidence presented by the county\n\ndemonstrated that \"the responsible public officials [had] desired to adopt a plan which would\n\nmaintain white political control to the maximum extent possible and thereby minimize the\n\nopportunity for effective political participation by black citizens.\" Id. at 1762. Indeed, the\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\fJustice Department explained, \"it appears that the board undertook extraordinary measures to\n\nadopt an election plan which minimizes minority voting strength.\" Id.\n\n       Finally, Congress heard direct evidence that some jurisdictions were looking to capitalize\n\non Bossier II and other cases to the disadvantage of minority voters. The testimony of Kent\n\nWillis, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia, provided a particularly\n\nstriking confirmation of this point. See House Hearing, 109th Cong. 894 (Oct. 18, 2005)\n\n(statement of Kent Willis). Willis explained that he had attended a 2002 redistricting meeting in\n\nFredricksburg, Virginia, where he lived. Id. The city had \"long had one African-American\n\nmajority district in its system,\" and African-Americans had historically been elected from that\n\ndistrict. Id. Willis testified that the discussion at the 2002 meeting \"was entirely about how do\n\nwe eliminate this district. And the instruction[] to the city attorney was, look at the recent\n\nSupreme Court case, you know, look at the cases that are taking place in the mid-'90s and early\n\n2000, and tell us if there is a way we can eliminate the African-American majority district.\" Id.\n\n       To summarize, Congress collected extensive evidence of purposefully discriminatory\n\nvoting changes that could or clearly would go into effect in the absence of the amendment in\n\nsubsection (c). It also heard testimony that leaving Bossier II intact would shift a great deal of\n\nvoting rights litigation from Section 5 to Section 2, and that such a shift would be a practical\n\ndisaster for minority voting rights. To correct these several problems, Congress amended section\n\n5 to specify that \"[t]he term 'purpose' in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall include any\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(c).\n\n       In light of the record before Congress, as well as the Supreme Court's caselaw defining\n\nand clarifying Congress's Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment enforcement powers, the Court\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fconcludes that Congress did not exceed its enforcement powers in enacting subsection (c). The\n\nSupreme Court's decision in United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006) illustrates why.\n\nThere, the plaintiff, a disabled inmate in a Georgia state jail, claimed that he was confined to a\n\ncell so small that he could not move his wheelchair and that he had to sit in his own bodily waste\n\nbecause prison officials refused to help him use the inaccessible toilets and showers. Id. at 156.\n\nHe argued that this treatment violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 12131\n\net seq. (\"ADA\"), and that Title II of the ADA abrogated Georgia's sovereign immunity. Id. The\n\nEleventh Circuit concluded that the ADA's attempted abrogation of Georgia's sovereign\n\nimmunity was invalid. Id. The Supreme Court reversed. Id. at 160. It first noted that if the\n\nplaintiff's allegations were true, his treatment likely constituted an independent Fourteenth\n\nAmendment violation (i.e., an Eighth Amendment violation incorporated against the states\n\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment) as well as a violation of the ADA. Id. at 157. The Court\n\nthen explained that, \"[w]hile the Members of this Court have disagreed regarding the scope of\n\nCongress's 'prophylactic' enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no one\n\ndoubts that § 5 grants Congress the power to 'enforce . . . the provisions' of the Amendment by\n\ncreating private remedies against the States for actual violations of those provisions.\" Id. at 158\n\n(internal citations omitted). Because the plaintiff claimed actual violations of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, Congress had broad remedial powers, including the usually disfavored power of\n\nabrogating a state's sovereign immunity. Id. at 158-59.\n\n       Here, subsection (c) forbids purposeful discrimination. By definition, purposeful\n\ndiscrimination by state actors on the basis of race violates the Constitution. U.S. CONST., amend.\n\nXIV; Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-41 (1976). Hence, the amendment to Section 5 in\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fsubsection (c) forbids only conduct that constitutes an actual Fourteenth Amendment violation,\n\nso Congress's enforcement powers are at their broadest. See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 158-59.\n\nSubsection (c) differs in just one way from a straightforward ban on unconstitutional conduct:\n\ninstead of putting the onus on the alleged victim to prove discrimination, the burden is shifted to\n\nthe state actor to prove the absence of discrimination. The Supreme Court has previously\n\napproved this burden-shifting procedure, see Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 334-35, and such burden-\n\nshifting seems far less intrusive than the abrogation of sovereign immunity approved in Georgia.\n\nSee 546 U.S. at 158-59. Given the substantial evidence that Congress amassed for the necessity\n\nof an amendment to Section 5, and the narrowness of the amendment Congress chose, the Court\n\nfinds that subsection (c) lies comfortably within Congress's enforcement powers.\n\n       In reality, the core of plaintiffs' challenge to subsection (c) is not about Congress's\n\nenforcement powers, but about the fear that the Department of Justice will use the purpose prong\n\nto extract its preferred results in the redistricting context. Plfs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. (\"Plfs.' MSJ\") at 28-30, 41-42; Plfs.' Opp. at 29-32. The witnesses who testified\n\nagainst the Bossier II \"fix\" were motivated by the same concern. See Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 11 (July 13, 2006) (statement of Michael Carvin); id. at 14 (statement of Abigail\n\nThernstrom); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 29-31 (Nov. 1, 2005) (statement of Roger Clegg).\n\nThe government argues in response that the Supreme Court's opinions in Miller and Shaw II\n\nmade clear that it may not so employ the purpose prong, and points to its regulations that\n\nunderscore the point. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 924-25; Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 911-13; see also 28\n\nC.F.R. § 51.54 (providing that Justice Department must use factors set forth in Village of\n\nArlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), in\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\fdetermining whether a voting change was motivated by discriminatory purpose); 28 C.F.R. §\n\n51.59(b) (providing that \"[a] jurisdiction's failure to adopt the maximum possible number of\n\nmajority-minority districts may not be the sole basis for determining that a jurisdiction was\n\nmotivated by a discriminatory purpose\"). Moreover, the government argues, neither plaintiffs\n\nnor the Congressional witnesses identified any instance of the Department of Justice's improper\n\nreliance on the purpose prong since Miller. Def.'s Opp. at 36-37. While it is true that the\n\nSupreme Court implicitly criticized the Justice Department for such behavior in 2000 in Bossier\n\nII, see 528 U.S. at 324, the objection that was the basis for that case was originally made in 1993,\n\ntwo years before Miller.\n\n       Whatever the merits of this concern, it is not the proper subject of a facial challenge to\n\nsubsection (c), and plaintiffs have made clear that they have disavowed their as-applied\n\nchallenge. \"In determining whether a law is facially invalid, we must be careful not to go\n\nbeyond the statute's facial requirements and speculate about hypothetical or imaginary cases.\"\n\nWash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449-50 (2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 22 (1960) (\"The delicate\n\npower of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference\n\nto hypothetical cases thus imagined.\"). Moreover, \"facial challenges threaten to short circuit the\n\ndemocratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being\n\nimplemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution. We must keep in mind that a ruling of\n\nunconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.\" Wash. State\n\nGrange, 552 U.S. at 451 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). That is particularly so\n\nwhere, as here, Congress has clearly undertaken its legislative task with great care. See Shelby\n\n\n\n                                                48\n\fCounty, 2011 WL 4375001, at *80.\n\n       If the Department of Justice employs subsection (c) to block unobjectionable voting\n\nprocedures, the affected jurisdiction will be entitled to bring an as-applied challenge to the\n\nstatute in a de novo proceeding in this district. LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 783 (citing City of Rome\n\nv. United States, 450 F. Supp. 378, 380-82 & n.3 (D.D.C. 1978)). But given the lack of any\n\ncurrent indication of such practices, this Court will not invalidate subsection (c) based on\n\nspeculation.\n\n               3. Subsections (b) and (d)\n\n       The challenge to subsections (b) and (d) revolves around the standard to be applied in\n\ndeciding whether to preclear districting and other changes that have the potential to dilute\n\nminority votes. It is therefore appropriate to repeat some of Shelby County's findings about\n\nintentionally discriminatory vote dilution.\n\n       The Congressional record contained significant evidence of intentionally dilutive actions\n\nin the districting context. For instance, Congress heard testimony about an episode in which\n\nMississippi state legislators opposed a redistricting plan that would have given African-\n\nAmericans an increased opportunity to elect representatives of their choice, referring to the plan\n\n\"on the House floor as the 'black plan' and privately as 'the n-plan.'\" S. Rep. No. 109-295, at 14.\n\nCongress also heard that during one round of redistricting, Georgia's Chair of its House\n\nReapportionment Committee told his colleagues in the Georgia legislature that he was uncertain\n\nas to the outcome of the state's redistricting process, \"because the Justice Department is trying to\n\nmake us draw nigger districts and I don't want to draw nigger districts.\" See Busbee, 549 F.\n\nSupp. at 501; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 67; House Hearing, 109th Cong. 54 (Nov. 9,\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f2005) (prepared statement of Laughlin McDonald).\n\n        Congress was also provided information that, in 2002, the Justice Department objected to\n\na redistricting plan proposed by the city of Albany, Georgia, based on the determination that\n\nAlbany had not \"carried its burden of showing that its proposed plan was not designed with the\n\nintent to limit and retrogress the increased black voting strength.\" See 1 House Hearing, Scope,\n\n109th Cong. 846 (Oct. 25, 2005) (Schlozman Appendix). The Justice Department examined\n\nAlbany's history of redistricting with respect to Ward 4, which, it found, revealed an \"intent to\n\nmaintain Ward 4 as a district that remains at the . . . level of 70 percent white, thus eliminating\n\nany ability of black voters to elect a candidate of choice in this district.\" Id. After the black\n\npopulation in Ward 4 doubled from 20% to 40% during the 1980s, Albany adopted a\n\nredistricting plan that reduced the Ward's population to 30% black. Then, after the black\n\npopulation in Ward 4 increased from 30% to almost 51% during the 1990s, the city sought\n\npreclearance for another redistricting plan that would have reduced the population in Ward 4 to\n\n30% black. Id. at 846-47. The Justice Department objected to the proposed plan, noting that\n\n\"implicit\" in the plan was \"an intent to limit black political strength in the city to no more than\n\nfour districts.\" Id. at 847.\n\n        Another intent-based objection was lodged against the 2001 redistricting plan proposed\n\nby Milden, Louisiana, in which the city \"explicitly decided to eliminate one of the three existing\n\nmajority minority districts,\" even though \"it was not compelled to redraw the district,\" and had\n\nbeen \"presented with an alternative that met all of its legitimate criteria while maintaining the\n\nminority community's electoral ability.\" Id. at 1150-52. The Justice Department interposed yet\n\nanother intent-based objection to a redistricting plan submitted by Sumter County, South\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fCarolina, that same year, after the county council \"explicitly decided to . . . eliminate one of the\n\nfour existing majority minority districts\" despite the fact that the district's elimination had been\n\n\"easily avoidable.\" See 2 House Hearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 2082-84 (Oct. 25, 2005)\n\n(Schlozman Appendix). In explaining the basis of its objection, the Justice Department noted\n\nthat the county had not been forced to redraw the district and that it had rejected an alternative,\n\nnon-retrogressive plan. Id. at 2083-84. Under the circumstances, the Justice Department was\n\nunable to conclude \"that the action in question was not motivated by a discriminatory intent to\n\nretrogress.\" Id. at 2084.\n\n       The record revealed many more similar instances. See, e.g., 1 House Hearing, Scope,\n\n109th Cong. 433 (Oct. 25, 2005) (Schlozman Appendix) (objecting to 1998 redistricting plan by\n\nTallapoosa County, Alabama, because \"the history of the instant redistricting process and its\n\nresults raise serious concerns that the county . . . purposely impaired the ability of black voters to\n\nelect a candidate of choice\"); id. at 412 (objecting to Greensboro, Alabama's 1993 redistricting\n\nplan on the ground that \"the opportunity for black voters to elect a representative of their choice .\n\n. . appears to have been constrained deliberately\"); id. at 1410 (objecting to Mississippi's 1991\n\nstatewide legislative redistricting plan where it appeared \"that the proposed plan is calculated not\n\nto provide black voters in the Delta with the equal opportunity for representation required by the\n\nVoting Rights Act\"); id. at 830 (objecting to 2000 redistricting plan for Webster County,\n\nGeorgia's board of education, where the plan was created shortly after the county had elected its\n\nfirst majority-black board, and the county's proffered reasons for the plan appeared to be \"merely\n\npretexts for intentionally decreasing the opportunity of minority voters to participate in the\n\nelectoral process\"); id. at 1611 (objecting to 1997 redistricting plan by Grenada, Mississippi,\n\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fbased on \"substantial direct and circumstantial evidence of discriminatory purpose\"); id. at 1516\n\n(refusing to withdraw objection to Greenville, Mississippi's 1991 redistricting plan, which\n\n\"appeared to have been motivated by a desire on the part of white city councilmembers to retain\n\nwhite control of the city's governing body,\" and explaining that since the plan's proposal, \"white\n\ncity officials [have] continue[d] to engage in race-based decisionmaking and to design schemes\n\nthe purpose of which is to avoid black control of city government\").\n\n       In addition to these examples, the legislative record included judicial decisions denying\n\npreclearance that relied on evidence of intentional discrimination. The 1990 redistricting in\n\nGeorgia -- in which Joe Mack Wilson, Chair of the state's House Reapportionment Committee,\n\nstated he did not want to draw \"nigger districts\" -- has already been discussed. In a more recent\n\ndeclaratory judgment action, the Louisiana House of Representatives sought preclearance for its\n\n2001 statewide redistricting plan, which eliminated a majority-black district in Orleans Parish,\n\nand failed to create a comparable district anywhere else in the state. See Nw. Austin I, 573 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 256; Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 28 (May 16, 2006) (responses of Theodore S.\n\nArrington to questions of Sens. Cornyn, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, and Kohl); Senate Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 152 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw responses); Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 42-44 (June 21,\n\n2006) (responses of Debo Adegbile to questions of Sens. Kennedy, Leahy, Cornyn, and Coburn).\n\nIn the course of defending their plan, Louisiana officials admitted that they had intentionally\n\n\"'obliterated'\" the majority-black district in order to achieve what they characterized as\n\n\"proportional\" representation for white voters in Orleans Parish. See Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J., La. House of Reps. v. Ashcroft, Civ. A. No. 02-62 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2003); see also\n\nSenate Hearing, 109th Cong. 43 (June 21, 2006) (Adegbile responses). But in selectively\n\n\n\n                                                 52\n\fapplying the theory of \"proportional representation\" to advantage only white voters in a\n\nparticular area of the state, Louisiana officials ignored the fact that it was the black population in\n\nOrleans Parish, not the white population, that had increased during the preceding decade. See\n\nSenate Hearing, 109th Cong. 28 (May 16, 2006) (Arrington responses). Moreover, the state\n\nmade no attempt to remedy blacks' statewide under-representation in proportion to their\n\npercentage of the population, despite its avowed desire to achieve proportional representation for\n\nwhite voters in a particular area of the state. See Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., La.\n\nHouse of Reps. v. Ashcroft, Civ. A. No. 02-62 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2003); Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 43 (June 21, 2006) (Adegbile responses); Nw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 256.\n\n       The Congressional record also contained many examples of changes to voting procedures\n\noutside the districting context that the Department of Justice found to be motivated by\n\nunconstitutional discriminatory purpose. For instance, an intent-based objection was interposed\n\nin response to Wilson County, North Carolina's 1986 change to its system for electing county\n\ncommissioners, in light of the Justice Department's determination that the county's method of\n\nelection had been purposefully \"designed and intended to limit the number of commissioners\n\nblack voters would be able to elect.\" 2 House Hearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 1731 (Schlozman\n\nAppendix). In the context of annexations, the Justice Department issued an objection in 1990 to\n\nthe decision by Monroe, Louisiana, to annex certain wards for the Monroe City Court,\n\nexplaining that the annexations would have reduced the black percentage of the City Court's\n\njurisdiction from 48.4% to 39.2%. 1 House Hearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 927 (Oct. 25, 2005)\n\n(Schlozman Appendix). The Justice Department also expressed concern regarding the timing of\n\nthe annexations, noting that one of the annexed wards \"had been eligible to be added to the City\n\n\n\n                                                  53\n\fCourt jurisdiction since at least 1970,\" but that there had been \"little or no interest in\n\nimplementing this change until immediately prior to the 1984 City Court primary election, which\n\nwe understand was marked by the presence of the first black candidate for the City Court.\" See\n\nid. 927-28; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 23. Similarly, the Justice Department in 1997\n\nobjected to the annexations proposed by the city of Webster, Texas, where \"the city's annexation\n\nchoices appear[ed] to have been tainted, if only in part, by an invidious racial purpose.\" 2 House\n\nHearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 2492 (Oct. 25, 2005) (Schlozman Appendix).\n\n       The Congressional record was thus replete with evidence of intentionally discriminatory\n\nvote dilution, particularly in the districting context. Keeping that evidence in mind, the Court\n\nwill now turn to consideration of the evidence Congress gathered about the possible\n\nconsequences of the Supreme Court's opinion in Georgia v. Ashcroft. But to begin with, a brief\n\nreview of the caselaw interpreting the \"effects\" prong of Section 5 is useful.\n\n       Section 5(a) provides that no change to voting procedures can be precleared if it \"will\n\nhave the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color[.]\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(a). The Supreme Court first addressed the meaning of \"the effect of denying or\n\nabridging the right to vote on account of race or color\" in Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130\n\n(1976). According to Beer, the purpose of Section 5 was to \"insure that no voting-procedure\n\nchanges would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities\n\nwith respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\" Id. at 141. The Beer Court\n\nadded that \"an ameliorative new legislative apportionment cannot violate § 5 unless the new\n\napportionment itself so discriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution.\"\n\nId. Under Beer, then, the effects prong of Section 5 was solely concerned with retrogression,\n\n\n\n                                                  54\n\fi.e., changes in voting practices or procedures that made the situation of minority voters worse.\n\n       The Beer standard was not so pellucid that it eliminated any possible questions about the\n\ninterpretation and application of the effects prong, but nonetheless, the Supreme Court did not\n\naddress the meaning of that prong again until Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461 (2003). There,\n\nthe Court considered in depth what it meant to make the situation of minority voters worse.\n\nAshcroft arose as a result of the 2000 redistricting in Georgia. Id. at 469. The Court explained\n\nthat \"a substantial majority of black voters in Georgia vote Democratic, [and] all elected black\n\nrepresentatives in the General Assembly are Democrats.\" Id. In the 2000 round of redistricting,\n\n\"[t]he goal of the Democratic leadership -- black and white -- was to maintain the number of\n\nmajority-minority districts and also increase the number of Democratic Senate seats.\" Id. To do\n\nso, the Democratic leadership agreed to a plan \"unpacking\" certain majority-minority districts\n\nwith very high concentrations of black voters. Id. at 469-71. Thus, the concentration of black\n\nvoters was reduced in some districts, and black voters -- a \"substantial majority\" of whom\n\nreliably voted Democratic -- were spread to other districts to increase Democratic candidates'\n\nchances of success. Id.\n\n       Instead of seeking administrative preclearance from the Attorney General, Georgia\n\ninstituted an action seeking judicial preclearance. Id. at 471. A three-judge panel denied\n\npreclearance on the grounds that the plan would \"diminish African American voting strength in\"\n\nthe unpacked districts, and that Georgia had \"failed to present any . . . evidence\" that the\n\nretrogression in those districts \"will be offset by gains in other districts.\" Georgia v. Ashcroft,\n\n195 F. Supp. 2d 25, 88 (D.D.C. 2002). Georgia appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nSee Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 475.\n\n\n\n                                                 55\n\f       The Supreme Court's task was to divine whether the districting plan, based on a complex\n\nmix of partisanship, incumbency protection, and compliance with the Voting Rights Act, \"'would\n\nlead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise\n\nof the electoral franchise.'\" 539 U.S. at 462 (quoting Beer, 425 U.S. at 141). In answering that\n\nquestion, the Supreme Court set out a lengthy \"totality of the circumstances\" test that courts\n\nevaluating retrogression should consider. 539 U.S. at 480-84. The Court emphasized that \"the\n\nability of a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice remains an integral feature in any § 5\n\nanalysis.\" Id. at 484. But, the Court said, it \"cannot be dispositive.\" Id. at 480. Rather,\n\n       [i]n order to maximize the electoral success of a minority group, a State may\n       choose to create a certain number of \"safe\" districts, in which it is highly likely\n       that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice.\n       Alternatively, a State may choose to create a greater number of districts in which\n       it is likely -- although perhaps not quite as likely as under the benchmark plan --\n       that minority voters will be able to elect candidates of their choice.\n           Section 5 does not dictate that a State must pick one of these methods of\n       redistricting over another. Either option will present the minority group with its\n       own array of electoral risks and benefits, and presents hard choices about what\n       would truly maximize minority electoral success.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In addition to the choice between fewer\n\ncompletely \"safe\" districts and more less safe districts, the Court wrote that the analysis should\n\ninclude whether a plan added or subtracted \"influence districts\" -- districts \"where minority\n\nvoters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not decisive,\n\nrole in the electoral process.\" Id. at 482. Finally, the Court added two additional considerations\n\nto its totality of the circumstances test: \"the comparative position of legislative leadership,\n\ninfluence, and power for representatives of the benchmark majority-minority districts\" and\n\nwhether minority-preferred representatives supported the plan. Id. at 483-84 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).\n\n\n                                                  56\n\f       Congress reacted to Ashcroft in 2006 by adding subsections (b) and (d) to Section 5.\n\nThose amendments provide that\n\n       (b) Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or\n       procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose of or will have the effect of\n       diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or\n       color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b (f)(2) of this\n       title, to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to\n       vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section.\n       ...\n       (d) The purpose of subsection (b) of this section is to protect the ability of such\n       citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b), (d). Hence, instead of allowing courts and the Department of Justice to\n\ntake into account a wide variety of potential indicators of minority voting effectiveness in\n\nconducting the preclearance analysis, Congress clarified that Section 5 is focused on minorities'\n\nability \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\" In the House Report accompanying the\n\nbill, Congress explained that the amendments were meant to return to the analysis articulated in\n\nBeer. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 71.\n\n       Unlike the debate over the Bossier II fix, which nearly all witnesses agreed was\n\nnecessary and appropriate, the Ashcroft fix was the subject of extended debate. A consistent\n\ntheme, however, was that the standard laid out in Ashcroft was impossibly challenging to\n\nadminister, particularly within the 60-day period in which the Department of Justice must make\n\npreclearance decisions. Witnesses called it \"an unworkable standard,\" Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 8 (May 16, 2006) (Arrington statement), \"subjective, abstract, and impressionistic,\" House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 49 (Nov. 9, 2005) (McDonald statement), \"amorphous [and] easily\n\nmanipulable . . . an open invitation to mischief . . . [and] poorly defined and virtually impossible\n\nto meaningfully administer.\" Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 39 (May 17, 2006) (Days responses).\n\n\n\n                                                 57\n\fRobert Kengle, the former Deputy Chief of the Voting Section of the Justice Department's Civil\n\nRights Division, testified that Ashcroft had \"introduced factors into the retrogression analysis\n\nthat make the Section 5 process more complicated and burdensome for everybody, not just for\n\nthe Department of Justice but for the jurisdictions that have to comply with it as well.\" House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 889 (Oct. 18, 2005) (statement of Robert A. Kengle). Kengle also worried\n\nthat Ashcroft would make preclearance decisions \"less predictable and more open to subjective\n\njudgments, individual preconceptions and even political biases.\" Id. A hearing in the House\n\nopened with the question, \"Georgia v. Ashcroft: can it be made workable?\" House Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 2 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Rep. Conyers statement).\n\n       Witnesses were particularly concerned about the introduction of \"influence\" districts into\n\nthe Section 5 calculus. \"Influence\" districts, as previously explained, are those where \"minority\n\nvoters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not decisive,\n\nrole in the electoral process.\" Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 482.5 Congressional witnesses testified that\n\na key problem with the Ashcroft opinion was the lack of a standard that would allow courts and\n\n       5\n           Influence districts contrast with majority-minority, crossover, and opportunity districts.\nThe meaning of those terms is subject to considerable debate. Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 235-\n37, 241-42. As used in this opinion, majority-minority districts are those where a minority group\nis able to elect its \"preferred candidates of choice\" without crossover voting from either white\nvoters or voters of a different minority group. See id. at 241-42 (discussing conceptual issues in\ndefining majority-minority districts). \"Crossover\" districts, sometimes called coalition districts,\nare those where minority voters can elect their candidates of choice with certain \"crossover\"\nvotes from white or other voters who support the minority group's candidates of choice. See\nBartlett v. Strickland, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1242-43 (2009) (discussing different types of districts).\n\"Crossover\" districts are different than influence districts because the minority voters are\nsufficiently numerous that they can choose the candidate, presumably because they form a\nmajority of voters in the primary elections, rather than choosing among white voters' candidates\nof choice. See id. at 1242; see also Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 236, 242-43. Finally, this Court\nwill use \"opportunity district\" as an all-purpose term for those jurisdictions where minority\nvoters can elect their candidates of choice. Both majority-minority districts and crossover\ndistricts are opportunity districts.\n\n                                                 58\n\fthe Justice Department to determine which districts were \"influence\" districts. Theodore Shaw\n\nexplained that \"[w]e don't know what 'influence districts' really mean[s].\" He asked:\n\n       How is influence effectively measured within DOJ’s sixty-day administrative\n       window? Does one look to roll call votes? Do those votes need to be on issues\n       that have a discernible race element or just a discernible position preferred by\n       minority group members? Is it enough if candidates for office campaign in\n       minority communities? Must influence be consistently in evidence or is\n       occasional influence sufficient?\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 13, 25 (Nov. 9, 2005) (statements of Theodore M. Shaw). Another\n\nwitness cited a study showing that a group's influence on a given legislator does not linearly\n\nincrease with the group's size, as one might expect, but rather has a \"curvi-linear relationship\" to\n\nthe group's size. House Hearing, 109th Cong. 57 (Nov. 9, 2005) (McDonald statement).\n\nMoreover, as Representative Feeney pointed out, all of these problems were compounded by the\n\nfact that what constituted an influence district would \"change from candidate to candidate and\n\ncycle to cycle and geographic area to geographic area.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 84 (Oct.\n\n25, 2005) (statement of Rep. Tom Feeney).\n\n       Several witnesses also testified that they were troubled by the fact that the Ashcroft\n\nopinion gave no guidance as to when and whether majority-minority districts or other\n\nopportunity districts could be traded for influence districts, and how many influence districts\n\nwould make up for the loss of an opportunity district. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 168 (May 9,\n\n2006) (Shaw responses); Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 116-17 (May 16, 2006) (responses of\n\nRichard H. Pildes to questions of Sens. Specter, Cornyn, Coburn, and Kohl); Senate Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 58-59 (May 17, 2006) (Days responses); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 139-40 &\n\nn.10 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 49-50 (May 4,\n\n2006) (Adegbile prepared statement). The lack of clarity about how to define influence districts,\n\n\n                                                 59\n\falong with the uncertainty about when influence districts could be traded for opportunity\n\ndistricts, combined to create what several witnesses saw as the most significant problem with\n\nAshcroft: the opinion might allow jurisdictions to substantially dilute minority voting strength\n\nunder the guise of creating more influence districts. In the most extreme scenario, a jurisdiction\n\ncould carve up every opportunity district into a series of influence districts where minorities\n\nmight actually have no influence at all. Such a result would give official legal cover to the\n\nblatant voting discrimination that Section 5 was designed to prevent, and would judicially\n\nsanction a return to the days of districts designed to spread minority voters as widely as possible.\n\nCf. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 84 (May 17, 2006) (responses of Armand Derfner to questions\n\nof Sens. Cornyn, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, and Schumer) (\"In this century, Mississippi’s\n\ncongressional district lines had been traditionally drawn from south to north, which meant that\n\nthe [largely black] Mississippi Delta was one congressional district. . . . [A]s soon as blacks\n\nstarted voting, and especially with the Voting Rights Act, . . . [Mississippi changed] the historic\n\npattern so that the new congressional lines went from east to west, thus fragmenting the black\n\npopulation in the Delta.\").\n\n       Even in less extreme scenarios, a jurisdiction could substantially dilute the voting power\n\nof minorities through substitution of influence districts for opportunity districts. See Senate\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 168-69 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw responses) (Ashcroft allows \"jurisdictions to\n\ncloak intentional discrimination under [its] intangible framework\"); House Hearing, 109th Cong.\n\n50 (Nov. 9, 2005) (McDonald statement) (\"The minority influence theory, moreover, is\n\nfrequently nothing more than a guise for diluting minority voting strength.\"); Senate Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 12 (May 17, 2006) (statement of Nathaniel Persily) (\"The risk of Georgia v.\n\n\n\n                                                 60\n\fAshcroft is that . . . under the cloak of influence districts, a jurisdiction would then break up a\n\ncohesive minority community into much smaller districts in which they really had no influence\n\nat all.\"). Professor Richard Pildes, who \"agree[d] with the Court on the Georgia facts\" and did\n\nnot support the \"fix,\" noted that even supporters of the Ashcroft decision were \"sometimes\n\nworried about the possible implications of the decision down the road,\" and thought that the\n\nhearings should clarify that a jurisdiction could not trade every opportunity district for influence\n\ndistricts. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 116-17 (May 16, 2006) (Pildes responses).\n\n       Congress also heard testimony about Ashcroft's holding that states are free to choose\n\namong the various ways of ensuring that minorities have an equal opportunity to participate\n\npolitically -- in other words, that states may choose between majority-minority districts,\n\ninfluence districts, crossover districts, and other types of participation. Robert Kengle, who\n\nagreed with parts of the Ashcroft decision and the theoretical importance of influence districts,\n\ntestified that he was \"quite uncomfortable with the notion that 'the State may choose . . . to risk\n\nhaving fewer minority representatives,' which strikes me as letting the fox guard the henhouse.\"\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 135, 139 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement) (quoting\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. at 464). The House Report reflected a specific Congressional finding that,\n\ngiven the record before Congress, covered jurisdictions should not be allowed unfettered\n\ndiscretion to choose among theories of representation. H.R. Rep. 109-478, at 70.\n\n       One final concern expressed by several witnesses was that consideration of influence\n\ndistricts would inject undue partisanship into the Voting Rights Act. Ashcroft itself, of course,\n\ngrew out of an attempt to maximize Democratic strength while complying with the Act. As one\n\nwitness bluntly summarized:\n\n\n\n                                                  61\n\f       [T]o the extent that I can imagine what measures would be used to determine\n       whether substantive representation or influence has been enhanced to prevent\n       retrogression, these measures amount to simply helping Democratic Party\n       candidates. In virtually every state legislature, in the Congress, and in many local\n       jurisdictions, minority representatives -- especially African Americans -- are\n       strongly allied with the Democratic Party. Helping Democratic Party candidates\n       would be argued to be equivalent to increasing minority voter influence and\n       helping minority substantive representation. In other words, influence districts, if\n       seen as a replacement for opportunities for minority voters to elect representatives\n       of their choice, would become simply a rationale for creating Democratic Party\n       gerrymanders.\n\nSenate Hearing, 109th Cong. 33 (May 16, 2006) (Arrington responses). But this was\n\nproblematic, because, as Theodore Shaw pointed out, \"a sustained identity between minority and\n\npartisan interests\" cannot always be assumed given that \"partisan links [may] weaken and shift,\n\nas they historically have done.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 26 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Shaw prepared\n\nstatement).\n\n       More broadly, Congress heard testimony that the Ashcroft standard too often subsumed\n\nthe goals of minority voters in favor of the goals of individual legislators and their political\n\nparties. For instance, the fact that minority legislators supported a given redistricting plan might\n\nmean that it protected their own districts, not that it was the best plan for minority voters. House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 22 (Oct. 25, 2005) (prepared statement of Robert Hunter). Asking judges\n\nor Justice Department attorneys to assess whether a given legislator had a sufficiently important\n\nleadership position -- and was likely to retain that leadership position after an election -- was\n\nseen as unrealistic. Id. at 25. Indeed, one of the Justice Department's rare attempts to apply the\n\nAshcroft standard before it was overturned was laid out in a 73-page memo that was later leaked,\n\nand voting rights scholars were highly critical of the Justice Department's efforts. See, e.g.,\n\nAbigail Thernstrom, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act: By Now, a Murky Mess, 5 GEO. J.L. &\n\n\n\n                                                  62\n\fPUB. POL'Y 41, 59-61 (2007) (\"Throughout the memo, the career attorneys attempted to read\n\npolitical tealeaves, predicting the race or political sympathies of candidates who would be\n\nelected from various districts under the new plan. It was a practice invited by the Ashcroft\n\nCourt, but . . . attorneys in Washington were (inevitably) not very good at it.\"). Summarizing the\n\nproblem, Robert Kengle testified:\n\n       Finally, in my view the Ashcroft decision makes its greatest departure from the\n       Supreme Court's other voting rights jurisprudence by introducing explicit partisan\n       calculations into the Section 5 review process. Creating influence and coalition\n       districts with partisan allies may in fact be the best way to maximize minority\n       voting strength in particular cases, and I think minority citizens and legislators\n       should be allowed considerable latitude to do so.\n          But to embody partisan calculations and tradeoffs into the Voting Rights Act\n       itself has not been well thought out and provides a means and motive not only to\n       politicize enforcement of Section 5, but also to undermine confidence that the Act\n       will be enforced in a way that transcends party politics.\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 143 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement). Condensing all of\n\nthese concerns, voting rights practitioner Debo Adegbile speculated that under the Ashcroft test,\n\nthe Section 5 analysis would become so complex that \"the statute will start to collapse of its own\n\nweight.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 58 (May 4, 2006) (Adegbile prepared statement).\n\n       To summarize, Congress gathered extensive evidence that discriminatory and dilutive\n\ntechniques remained a significant problem, and that the Ashcroft standard did not remedy -- and\n\ncould easily worsen -- the problem. Congress therefore chose to overrule Ashcroft with the\n\namendments codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973c(b) and (d). A striking feature of the Ashcroft \"fix,\"\n\nhowever, was the widespread uncertainty about what it meant. As one law professor put it,\n\n\"Congress did not so much reverse Ashcroft as remand it to the courts with equivocal\n\ninstructions.\" J. Morgan Kousser, The Strange, Ironic Career of Section 5 of the Voting Rights\n\nAct, 1965-2007, 86 TEX. L. REV. 667, 755 (2008). One of the effects of the amendments is\n\n\n                                                63\n\fundisputed: they made clear that influence districts could not be substituted for opportunity\n\ndistricts. Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 235-37, 247. What the amendments did not resolve,\n\nhowever, was whether crossover districts were protected from retrogression and what sort of\n\ntradeoffs between majority-minority and crossover districts were appropriate. Some witnesses\n\nconcluded that the Ashcroft fix was a simple return to the status quo ante, i.e., the Beer test,\n\nwhile others disagreed. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 149 (May 9, 2006) (responses of Laughlin\n\nMcDonald to questions of Sens. Specter, Kennedy, Schumer and Cornyn); Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 168-69 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw responses). But as Nathaniel Persily has explained, \"[t]he\n\nproblem is that there is disagreement about what the standard under Beer was.\" Persily, Promise\n\nand Pitfalls 234.\n\n       The text of Beer certainly does not answer questions about crossover districts and\n\ntradeoffs, and the Supreme Court had never attempted to clarify the issue until Ashcroft. Nor\n\ndoes the text of the amendments obviously answer that question. The House and Senate reports\n\nvividly illustrate the amendments' ambiguity. The House report provides that \"[v]oting changes\n\nthat leave a minority group less able to elect a preferred candidate of choice, either directly or\n\nwhen coalesced with other voters, cannot be precleared under Section 5.\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-\n\n478, at 71. Hence, according to the House report, crossover districts as well as majority-\n\nminority districts are protected under the amendments. The Senate report presents a truly bizarre\n\nsituation. The Senate unanimously voted to renew Section 5 on July 20, 2006. S. Rep. 109-295,\n\nat 54-55. A draft Senate report had been circulated, but instead of accepting it, the Republican\n\nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee produced their own report six days after the passage\n\nof the bill, over the vehement protests of the Democratic members of the Committee. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 64\n\fAccording to that Report, subsections (b) and (d) were intended only \"to protect naturally\n\noccurring majority-minority districts,\" not crossover districts. Id. at 19. Moreover, the\n\nRepublican Senate Report specifically stated that \"coalition or influence districts\" could never be\n\nsubstituted for naturally occurring majority-minority districts. Id. Although this Court will not\n\nrely on a one-party, post hoc report as evidence of what the amendments actually mean, the\n\nreport does reflect disagreement among members of Congress as to their meaning.\n\n        In the context of this facial challenge, then, the Court must construe the amendments,\n\nbearing in mind that they should not be found unconstitutional unless there is no plausible\n\nconstitutional construction. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr.\n\nTrades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988); David L. Franklin, Facial Challenges, Legislative\n\nPurpose, and the Commerce Clause, 92 IOWA L. REV. 41, 58 (2006) (a facial challenge asserts\n\nthat a statute is \"invalid on its face as written and authoritatively construed, when measured\n\nagainst the applicable substantive constitutional doctrine\"). The key interpretive question, as\n\npreviously explained, is whether the amendments permit the Section 5 analysis to include\n\ncrossover districts and whether they permit any tradeoffs between crossover and majority-\n\nminority districts. Looking solely to the text of the amendments, the Court believes that they\n\npermit both. Subsection (b) provides that \"Any [voting procedure] . . . that has the purpose of or\n\nwill have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of\n\nrace or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b). Subsection (d) further clarifies that \"[t]he purpose of subsection (b) of\n\nthis section is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(d). Nothing in the phrase \"elect their preferred candidates of choice\"\n\n\n\n                                                  65\n\fspecifies that voters must do so only from majority-minority districts.6\n\n        Influence districts do not fit within the terms of the amendments because voters who only\n\n\"influence\" an election are not able to choose, and then elect, the candidates who best represent\n\nthem. Instead, they can only choose between candidates preferred by other groups. In any\n\nevent, the legislative history makes overwhelmingly clear that influence districts are no longer a\n\nfactor in the Section 5 analysis under the amendments. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 70. In\n\ncrossover districts, however, minority voters form a sufficiently large percentage of the\n\nregistered voter population to select a \"preferred candidate of choice\" in the primary, and to elect\n\nthat preferred candidate -- with crossover voting from those who are not part of the minority\n\ngroup -- in the general election. See Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 236 (citing Bernard Grofman,\n\nLisa Handley & David Lubin, Drawing Effective Minority Districts: A Conceptual Framework\n\nand Some Empirical Evidence, 79 N.C. L. REV. 1383, 1407-09 (2001)). Hence, the Court finds\n\nthat crossover districts fit within the statutory scheme. Moreover, the Court sees nothing in the\n\ntext of the amendments that would prevent a certain amount of tradeoff between majority-\n\nminority districts and crossover districts, assuming that minority voters indeed have the ability to\n\nelect preferred candidates of their choice in the crossover districts.\n\n        But the amendments did more than just remove influence districts from the preclearance\n\nanalysis: they also affirmed that minorities' \"ability to elect,\" not the \"totality of the\n\n\n\n        6\n          This Court recognizes that this interpretation conflicts with the three-justice plurality's\nreading of a similar phrase in the Section 2 context in Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1243-45, although\nthe four justices in dissent agreed with this Court's reading. Id. at 1250. The plurality's opinion,\nhowever, was based on administrative and constitutional concerns rather than the text of the\nstatute. Id. at 1244-45, 1247-48. Moreover, the plurality explicitly held that its conclusion did\nnot apply in the Section 5 context. Id. at 1249; see also id. at 1258 (Souter, J., dissenting)\n(discussing Section 2 and Section 5).\n\n                                                   66\n\fcircumstances,\" is the critical issue in the preclearance of any proposed voting change. Hence,\n\ncourts and the Justice Department can no longer consider many of the factors that the Ashcroft\n\nCourt identified as relevant to the totality of the circumstances test. Specifically, the\n\npreclearance analysis can no longer consider minority-preferred politicians' views of the\n\nproposed change, nor can it consider whether the position or power of a particular minority-\n\npreferred politician could substitute in some way for the ability to elect. More generally, any\n\nfactor that is not related to minorities' \"ability to elect\" is off the table. This principle is not\n\nlimitless, of course: courts and the Justice Department are required to consider certain\n\nconstitutional mandates, including compliance with the one person one vote principle and equal\n\nprotection principles, and caselaw and history have established that the preclearance analysis\n\nincludes consideration of population growth and decline. Infra at 89-90. But the universe of\n\nrationales that can justify a change to voting procedures is now considerably smaller than it was\n\nunder Ashcroft.\n\n        The third and final question under Boerne is whether the amendments, so construed, are a\n\ncongruent and proportional response to the pattern of unconstitutional behavior that Congress\n\nidentified and the problems that Congress found infected the Ashcroft standard. It is important\n\nto keep in mind that plaintiffs' challenge here is only to the amendments; the Court has already\n\nfound that the general preclearance procedure is a congruent and proportional remedy to the\n\nunconstitutional behavior Congress identified. Shelby County, 2011 WL 4375001, at *80.\n\n        In this step of the Boerne analysis, the critical issue is whether Congress is enforcing the\n\nguarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, rather than attempting substantively to\n\nredefine those Amendments. Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519-20. That is, the question is whether the\n\n\n\n                                                   67\n\flaw can \"be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\" Id.\n\nat 532. Courts must afford Congress \"wide latitude\" in deciding what legislation will enforce,\n\nrather than define, a constitutional guarantee. Id. at 519-20. In conducting the third step of the\n\nBoerne analysis, the Supreme Court has been particularly cognizant of the federalism costs of\n\nthe challenged law. In Boerne itself, for instance, the Court found that RFRA exceeded\n\nCongress's enforcement power in part because it was \"a considerable congressional intrusion into\n\nthe States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of\n\ntheir citizens,\" and imposed \"a heavy litigation burden on the states.\" Id. at 534.\n\n       To discern whether subsections (b) and (d) can \"be understood as responsive to, or\n\ndesigned to prevent\" intentional voting discrimination, it is important to keep in mind two\n\nfoundational points about voting, and about districting in particular. First, \"voting is more than\n\nan atomistic exercise.\" Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 1048-49 (Souter, J., dissenting). Voting\n\ndistricts are explicitly designed to protect certain communities of interest, whether partisan,\n\nissue-oriented, or any of a number of other characteristics. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 916\n\n(\"traditional districting principles\" include \"respect for political subdivisions [and] communities\n\ndefined by actual shared interests\"); see also Pamela S. Karlan & Daryl J. Levinson, Why Voting\n\nis Different, 84 CAL. L. REV. 1201, 1204-08, 1271-19 (1996) (hereinafter Karlan & Levinson,\n\nWhy Voting is Different). If voting and representation were perceived as a purely \"atomistic\n\nexercise,\" districting could be reduced to no more than drawing districts of equal size. But, as\n\nthe thousands of pages of opinions addressing redistricting issues show, \"traditional districting\n\nprinciples\" are aimed at much more than numerical equivalence. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S.\n\n630, 647 (1993) (\"Shaw I\").\n\n\n\n                                                 68\n\f       The second foundational point is why racial groups are sometimes considered\n\n\"communities of interest\" that can be gathered into districts. Groups defined in part by race are\n\nconsidered communities of interests if, and only if, empirical evidence demonstrates that group\n\nmembers' voting behavior is similar. In other words, saying that members of a given racial\n\ngroup in a certain area currently vote alike is not a stereotype when it is a descriptive fact.\n\nKarlan & Levinson, Why Voting is Different 1204-08, 1217-18. The government may never, of\n\ncourse, engage in \"the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race,\n\nbecause of their race, think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same\n\ncandidates at the polls.\" Miller, 515 U.S. at 911-12 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). Nor may the government assume that minority groups that have voted alike in one\n\nelection will do so for all time. But when evidence demonstrates members of a racial minority in\n\na given place have found an \"efficacious political identity,\" League of United Latin American\n\nCitizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 435 (2006) (\"LULAC\"), an absolute mandate of federal\n\ngovernment colorblindness is perverse: it allows less colorblind State officials to intentionally\n\nfragment the minority group into several districts (or pack them into one district) to avoid the\n\nelection of candidates who represent the group's political identity. Cf. Parents Involved in Cmty.\n\nSchs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 788 (2007) (hereinafter \"Parents Involved\")\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"And, as an aspiration, Justice Harlan's axiom [that our Constitution\n\nis color-blind] must command our assent. In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot be a\n\nuniversal constitutional principle.\").\n\n       The record before Congress demonstrated, first, that certain racial groups in covered\n\njurisdictions had found \"efficacious political identit[ies].\" LULAC, 548 U.S. at 435. Second, it\n\n\n\n                                                  69\n\fdemonstrated extensive intentional attempts to fragment or pack potentially cohesive racial\n\nminorities to ensure that they could not elect representatives attuned to those political interests.\n\nWithout evidence of both of those points, Congress would not have been entitled to create a\n\nremedy as sweeping and race-conscious as the preclearance procedure. But given that record\n\nevidence, Congress had the ability under its Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment enforcement\n\nauthority to design legislation to \"respon[d] to . . . or . . . prevent [that] unconstitutional\n\nbehavior.\" Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532.\n\n        The unconstitutional behavior Congress was trying to prevent was intentional vote\n\ndilution aimed at making minority votes less effective. The legislation Congress designed\n\ndirectly responds to that problem by refusing preclearance to any voting change that\n\n\"diminish[es] the ability\" of such groups \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973c(b). The legislation is thus precisely congruent to the problem, because it forbids\n\nthe entire category of behavior Congress found to be problematic. But because it also forbids\n\nsome constitutional behavior -- voting changes that reduce minority voting effectiveness, but not\n\nfor intentionally discriminatory reasons -- the Court must consider whether it is proportional to\n\nthe problem.\n\n        In judging whether subsections (b) and (d) are a proportional response to the problem, the\n\nCourt emphasizes again that proportionality of the Ashcroft standard is not at issue. But, as this\n\nCourt has construed the statute, the differences between the standards in subsections (b) and (d)\n\nand in Ashcroft are relatively limited. In the districting context, the key difference is that\n\ninfluence districts are no longer part of the Section 5 calculus. But Congress heard considerable\n\ntestimony that including consideration of influence districts in the Section 5 analysis would have\n\n\n\n                                                  70\n\fhad deeply problematic results. Allowing tradeoffs between opportunity districts and influence\n\ndistricts would have created a means to cloak intentional discrimination -- that is, intentional\n\nfragmentation of politically cohesive groups -- under the guise of creating influence districts.\n\nMoreover, as discussed below, Congress had reason to be concerned that keeping influence\n\ndistricts as part of the Section 5 analysis would leave Section 5 vulnerable to an equal protection\n\nchallenge.\n\n       The amendments also eliminated consideration of the amorphous \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\" factors, including consideration of minority-preferred legislators' views of the\n\nproposed voting changes and consideration of the position of particular minority-preferred\n\npoliticians. But Congress heard testimony that integrating such factors into Section 5 would\n\nresult in a statute that was impossible for the Department of Justice to administer effectively\n\nwithin its sixty-day window. Moreover, Congress heard testimony that the results of the\n\npreclearance process would be increasingly partisan, subjective, and unpredictable, driving up\n\ncosts for both the federal government and the affected jurisdictions. This subjectivity and\n\nunpredictability was compounded by the fact that a \"totality of the circumstances\" test could\n\ninclude unspecified factors even beyond those mentioned in Ashcroft. Given the record\n\nevidence, it is quite understandable that Congress concluded that a totality of the circumstances\n\ntest could \"undermine confidence that the Act will be enforced in a way that transcends party\n\npolitics,\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 143 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement), and\n\ncould cause Section 5 to \"collapse of its own weight.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 58 (May 4,\n\n2006) (Adegbile statement).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 71\n\f        The standard laid out in subsections (b) and (d) also has several important limitations.\n\nSee Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533 (\"limitations\" including \"termination dates, geographic restrictions,\n\nor egregious predicates . . . tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate\n\nunder § 5\"). First, like the rest of Section 5, the amendments are temporally and geographically\n\nlimited: they will expire after twenty-five years (that is, two redistricting cycles), and they apply\n\nonly in certain jurisdictions. Shelby County, 2011 WL 4375001, at *72-74. In the vote dilution\n\ncontext, they also have an elegant, self-executing limitation. As this Court has previously\n\nexplained, a group defined by race can be considered a community of interest for voting\n\npurposes only when empirical evidence, rather than stereotypes, demonstrates that members of\n\nthe minority group vote alike. This critical fact is built in to the \"ability to elect\" test because, as\n\nracially polarized voting decreases, the number of districts affected by Section 5 decreases as\n\nwell. As racially polarized voting decreases, majority-minority districts can frequently be\n\nreplaced with crossover districts. See Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1254-55 (Souter, J., dissenting). If\n\nracially polarized voting disappeared entirely -- such that there is no correlation between race\n\nand voting -- it would be virtually impossible for a districting plan to be retrogressive under\n\nSection 5. Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 243. Hence, should racially polarized voting\n\nsubstantially diminish before twenty-five years have passed -- and with it, the ability (and\n\nmotivation) for legislators to draw dilutive districts -- Section 5 will play a dramatically smaller\n\nrole in state voting procedures even before it officially expires.\n\n        The final consideration under Boerne is the federalism costs the amendments in\n\nsubsections (b) and (d) exact, both in terms of \"congressional intrusion into the States' traditional\n\nprerogatives\" and pragmatic costs, such as litigation costs. 521 U.S. at 534. This Court\n\n\n\n                                                  72\n\frecognizes, of course, that the Voting Rights Act as a whole represents a considerable \"intrusion\n\ninto the States' traditional prerogatives.\" But, as explained in Shelby County, that intrusion is\n\njustified by the persistent, purposeful discrimination aimed at minorities attempting to exercise\n\ntheir core constitutional voting rights. 2011 WL 4375001, at *80. Hence, the only question\n\nhere is whether the amendments represent an intrusion beyond that imposed by the general\n\npreclearance regime.\n\n       In one sense, the federalism costs are greater under subsections (b) and (d) than they were\n\nunder Ashcroft because states have less latitude to choose among theories of representation and\n\npolitical participation. But, as this Court has construed the statute, Congress narrowed the states'\n\nlatitude only as much as necessary to accomplish its goal. States may still draw either crossover\n\nor majority-minority districts, and some tradeoff between them is appropriate. See Bartlett, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 1254-55 (Souter, J., dissenting) (recognizing in Section 2 context that \"crossover\n\ndistricts ha[ve] the value of giving States greater flexibility to draw districting plans with a fair\n\nnumber of minority-opportunity districts\"). Moreover, because influence districts are no longer\n\nprotected from retrogression, states have substantially more freedom to redraw district lines in\n\ndistricts that do not qualify as opportunity districts. In terms of pragmatic costs, subsections (b)\n\nand (d) almost certainly work in the states' favor. The complexity of the test outlined in Ashcroft\n\nwould likely have led to very difficult preclearance decisions and extraordinarily complex\n\nlitigation. By returning to a test that is substantially closer to the familiar Beer test, Congress\n\nreduced the complexity and costs of the preclearance process.\n\n       The amendments in subsections (b) and (d) sweep broadly, and they admittedly capture a\n\ncertain amount of behavior that is constitutional. But, as the Court has previously found, the\n\n\n\n                                                  73\n\fretrogression principle itself is justified by the evidence of persistent, intentional discrimination\n\nthat Congress amassed. The amendments' modification to the Beer and Ashcroft tests was\n\nnecessary to avoid giving cover to intentional discrimination and to prevent an administrability\n\nnightmare that would itself harm covered jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Court concludes that\n\nsubsections (b) and (d)'s modifications to the Beer and Ashcroft tests represent a congruent and\n\nproportional response to the problem of intentionally discriminatory dilutive techniques. Hence,\n\nthey survive plaintiffs' constitutional challenge.\n\n                                          III. COUNT II\n\n                                            A. Standing\n\n       The Court now turns to Count II of plaintiffs' complaint, which is similar to Count I's\n\nchallenge to the amendments in several ways. Both counts assert that the amendments are\n\nunconstitutional, but they rest on different theories: Count I claims that the amendments exceed\n\nCongress's enforcement powers, while Count II claims that they violate equal protection\n\nprinciples.7 Accordingly, the standing analysis for the two claims is in some respects similar.\n\nFor the same reasons discussed in part II.A, the Court finds that plaintiffs have standing to bring\n\ntheir challenge to subsections (b) and (d). Nix was injured because a referendum from which he\n\nwould have benefitted was suspended due to the operation of an allegedly unconstitutional law.\n\nUnder Akins, he has shown causation and redressability as to subsections (b) and (d). However,\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the amendments violate the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is substantively identical\nto the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). The Fifth Amendment applies against the federal government,\nwhile the Fourteenth Amendment applies against the states.\n\n                                                  74\n\ffor the reasons given in part II.A, Nix does not have standing to bring an equal protection\n\nchallenge to subsection (c).\n\n       The D.C. Circuit directed this Court to consider several questions about plaintiffs' Count\n\nII standing on remand. See LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 794-96. The Court has addressed most of\n\nthose issues in the discussion of Count I, but one additional point must be addressed here. The\n\nD.C. Circuit asked whether, given that plaintiffs' equal protection challenge is only facial,\n\nplaintiffs have \"met the requirement that litigants claiming injury from a racial classification\n\nestablish that they 'personally [have been] denied equal treatment by the challenged\n\ndiscriminatory conduct.'\" Id. at 795 (quoting United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 743-44\n\n(1995)). This Court does not believe that Hays presents an obstacle for plaintiffs here.\n\nExplaining why requires reviewing one branch of the Supreme Court's equal protection\n\njurisprudence.\n\n       The Hays plaintiffs brought a claim under Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 652, which allows voters\n\nwho live in districts allegedly drawn with excessive attention to race to bring an equal protection\n\nchallenge. A Shaw claim is not a vote dilution claim, but rather the \"analytically distinct claim\"\n\nthat a voter experiences a stigmatic harm when she is placed into a district because of her race.\n\nId.; see also Miller, 515 U.S. at 911-913. The plaintiffs in Hays attempted to bring a Shaw\n\nchallenge to the creation of a district in which they did not live. 515 U.S. at 739. The Supreme\n\nCourt found that they did not have standing. The Court explained that the Shaw I plaintiffs had\n\nstanding because they had suffered a particularized stigmatic injury, but that the Hays plaintiffs\n\nhad not suffered any such stigmatic injury because they did not allege that they themselves had\n\nbeen placed into a particular district because of their race. Id. at 744-45.\n\n\n\n                                                 75\n\f       Like the plaintiffs in Hays, the plaintiffs here have not been personally subjected to a\n\nracial classification; hence, they cannot claim a stigmatic equal protection injury under Shaw.\n\nBut that does not defeat standing, because this Court's conclusion that plaintiffs have standing to\n\nbring this challenge rests on an entirely different conception of their injury. Plaintiffs' injury is\n\nnot that they are subjected to a racial classification that creates either concrete or stigmatic\n\nharms, but that a law that allegedly violates equal protection principles denied them the benefit\n\nof the nonpartisan voting referendum. While this is not a \"personal[] deni[al] [of] equal\n\ntreatment,\" Hays, 515 U.S. at 744 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), as would be\n\nrequired for a plaintiff bringing a Shaw claim, it is a concrete, particularized injury, and that is\n\nwhat is required under the Supreme Court's standing jurisprudence. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\n\n       Plaintiffs have also offered another, wholly different standing analysis for Count II.\n\nBecause plaintiffs' alternative argument would establish standing to bring their subsection (c)\n\nclaim, which they do not otherwise have, the Court must consider that argument as well. Citing\n\nNortheastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America v. City of\n\nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656 (1993), plaintiffs argue that their injury-in-fact is \"the denial of equal\n\ntreatment that exists because election changes supported by Plaintiffs and other non-minorities in\n\nKinston cannot become law without satisfying those amendments' minority-preferences.\" Plfs.'\n\nOpp. at 35. Or, as they phrase it elsewhere in their briefs, \"wholly apart from the referendum,\n\nPlaintiffs have standing as non-minority voters in Kinston who seek to ensure that beneficial\n\nlocal laws need not run the gauntlet of unconstitutional minority-preferences contained in the\n\n2006 amendments to Section 5.\" Plfs.' Opp. at 37.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  76\n\f       In Jacksonville, the plaintiff brought a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to a city\n\nordinance that required that 5% of the amount spent on city contracts be set aside for businesses\n\nwith at least 51% female or minority ownership. 508 U.S. at 658, 661. The plaintiff was an\n\norganization of business owners, most of whose businesses did not qualify for the 5% set-aside.\n\nId. at 658. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the organization lacked standing because it\n\ncould not point to specific contracts its members would have been awarded in the absence of the\n\nset-aside program. Id. at 660. The Supreme Court disagreed:\n\n       When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of\n       one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member\n       of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would\n       have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing. The\n       \"injury in fact\" in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal\n       treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to\n       obtain the benefit.\n\nId. at 666. The Supreme Court identified the core equal protection injury as \"the inability to\n\ncompete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract.\" Id. Here,\n\nplaintiffs allege that the 2006 amendments to Section 5 function as a \"discriminatory barrier\"\n\nthat prevents them from competing equally with minorities in the advancement of \"beneficial\n\nlocal laws\" like the referendum. Plfs.' Opp. at 37. They contend that it is therefore irrelevant\n\nwhether they would have obtained the benefit -- enactment of the referendum -- but for the\n\ndiscriminatory barrier.\n\n       But one difference between this case and Jacksonville is immediately apparent. In\n\nJacksonville, it was \"more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it [wa]s for\n\nmembers of another group.\" Id. at 666. That is, a white business owner in Jacksonville could\n\ncompete for only 95% of the city contract dollars, while a minority business owner could\n\n\n\n                                                77\n\fcompete for 100% of those dollars. Id. at 658-61. Therefore, white business owners were\n\ntreated differently than were black business owners in Jacksonville solely because of the color of\n\ntheir skin. That is not at all true here, because white supporters of the nonpartisan referendum\n\nare in exactly the same position as black supporters of the referendum. The Justice Department's\n\npreclearance letter focused solely on the referendum's ultimate effects, not on whether white or\n\nblack citizens proposed and supported it.8 Plaintiffs do not claim that the Justice Department\n\nrelied on their race at any point in the decision whether to preclear the referendum; indeed, all\n\nindications are that the Attorney General would have made the same decision if plaintiffs were\n\nminorities. A black Republican or nonpartisan candidate who stood to benefit from the\n\nreferendum would be precisely as frustrated as Nix is.\n\n       Plaintiffs' argument that white voters have standing to challenge the amendments because\n\nthe Voting Rights Act was meant to benefit minorities is unpersuasive. See Mot. Hr'g Tr.\n\n[Docket Entry 66] 22:18-23, 23:3-11, Oct. 26, 2011. The Supreme Court made clear in Shaw I\n\nthat both white voters and minority voters could bring a claim of a racial classification injury\n\ncaused by the operation of the Voting Rights Act. Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 652 (holding that \"white\n\nvoters . . . or voters of any other race\" could bring claim of stigmatic equal protection injury).\n\nWhether the Voting Rights Act and Section 5 were intended to benefit white or minority voters\n\nwas irrelevant. That question is similarly irrelevant here.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          Ironically, that statement might not be true if the Ashcroft standard were still in place.\nWhen the Justice Department applied Ashcroft to evaluate the switch from nonpartisan to\npartisan elections in the Charleston County School Board, the Department did consider how\nblack representatives and other community members viewed the proposed change. See Letter\nfrom R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant Attorney General, to C. Havird Jones, Jr., Senior Assistant\nAttorney General (Feb. 26, 2004).\n\n                                                 78\n\f        Unlike the Jacksonville plaintiff, the plaintiffs here have not shown that the government\n\nclassified them based on the color of their skin. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 666; see also Townes,\n\n577 F.3d at 546, 548, 550-51 (allowing black habeas petitioner to rely on Jacksonville for\n\nstanding because he alleged that white inmate had been treated differently). And unlike the\n\nShaw I plaintiffs, they do not claim any stigmatic injury. Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 652. The only\n\nconcrete way in which the amendments injured plaintiffs was in suspending the referendum, and,\n\nas explained, only subsections (b) and (d) caused that injury. The Court therefore concludes\n\nagain that plaintiffs lack standing to bring their challenge to subsection (c). Nonetheless, for the\n\nreasons explained earlier, the Court will proceed to set forth how it would analyze plaintiffs'\n\nCount II claim as to subsection (c) if plaintiffs had standing to pursue that claim.\n\n                                      B. Standard of Review\n\n        The baseline standard of review in racial classification cases is well established: racial\n\nclassifications, whether employed by the federal government or a state or local government, are\n\nreviewed under strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995).\n\nAlthough there are two reasons that principle might not apply here, the Court concludes that it\n\nshould apply strict scrutiny to plaintiffs' claims.\n\n        The first reason that strict scrutiny might not apply is that the amendments to Section 5\n\nare, on their face, race-neutral. They provide only that no voting changes that \"ha[ve] the\n\npurpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States\n\non account of race or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice\" can be precleared.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b). Unlike, say, a set-aside for businesses owned by minorities, the\n\namendments make no textual distinction between white and minority voters. Still, it is clear\n\n\n\n                                                  79\n\fbeyond peradventure that the purpose of Section 5 and the 2006 amendments is to protect\n\nminority voting rights, and that they are applied to do so. See Def.'s Opp. at 12 (\"In any event, it\n\nhas been clear since at least 1976 . . . that Section 5 is not race-neutral.\"). Laws \"neutral on their\n\nface but 'unexplainable on grounds other than race'\" are analyzed under strict scrutiny. Miller,\n\n515 U.S. at 905 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266). That principle governs here.\n\n       The second reason strict scrutiny might not apply is that, as the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized, voting regulations -- particularly in the context of districting -- are different than\n\nother government actions. While most government actions should be wholly colorblind, a\n\nlegislature \"always is aware of race when it draws district lines, just as it is aware of age,\n\neconomic status, religious and political persuasion, and a variety of other demographic factors.\"\n\nShaw I, 509 U.S. at 646. Hence, districting based in part on governmental \"aware[ness] of race\"\n\nis not always reviewed under strict scrutiny. See id. The Supreme Court's caselaw on how far\n\nthis principle extends is extremely fractured. Some members of the Court have endorsed the\n\nproposition that intentional creation of majority-minority districts is a form of mere racial\n\nawareness, not racial classification, while others have disagreed or refused to take a position on\n\nthat question. See Vera, 517 U.S. at 958 (plurality opinion) (intentional creation of majority-\n\nminority districts can be mere racial awareness that does not require strict scrutiny); id. at 996\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (declining to take a position); id. at 999 (Thomas and Scalia, JJ.,\n\nconcurring in judgment) (finding that strict scrutiny applies to all intentional creation of\n\nmajority-minority districts); id. at 1003-04 (Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., dissenting)\n\n(finding that strict scrutiny did not apply to majority-minority districts before the Court); id. at\n\n\n\n\n                                                  80\n\f1045-46 (Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., dissenting) (rejecting Shaw I's strict scrutiny\n\nframework).\n\n        It might be possible to describe Section 5 and the 2006 amendments as mere federal\n\n\"awareness\" of how race functions in the context of voting laws. If intentional creation of\n\nmajority-minority districts is sometimes a function of racial awareness rather than racial\n\nclassification, then Section 5 -- a law that creates certain rules and limitations for districting and\n\nother voting regulations -- may be as well. As explained, the Supreme Court's caselaw on when\n\nstrict scrutiny applies to state action in drawing districts is severely splintered, and it is unclear\n\nwhether it would apply at all in the context of the federal government's enactment of Section 5.\n\nBecause translating the Shaw/Vera caselaw into this context is so unwieldy, the Court will\n\npresume that the usual equal protection principles apply rather than the unique exception in the\n\ndistricting context. Accordingly, the Court will apply strict scrutiny to plaintiffs' equal\n\nprotection challenge. Hence, the government must show that the use of race in the 2006\n\namendments is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve a \"compelling\" government interest. Parents\n\nInvolved, 551 U.S. at 720 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n                                              C. Merits\n\n        1. Subsection (c)\n\n        The constitutionality of subsection (c) is largely resolved by the Court's discussion of\n\nsubsection (c) with respect to Count I. As explained there, all that Congress has forbidden in\n\nsubsection (c) is purposefully discriminatory actions that dilute the voting power of minorities.\n\nAs this simply repeats the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment, it cannot also violate the\n\nEqual Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-\n\n\n\n                                                   81\n\f41 (1976) (explaining that intentional discrimination by government actors violates the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (explaining that\n\n\"[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       Here, as in Count I, plaintiffs' real concern is that the Department of Justice will use\n\nsubsection (c) as a sword rather than a shield. But the Supreme Court made clear in Miller and\n\nShaw II that doing so would be unlawful. Miller, 515 U.S. at 924-25; Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 911-\n\n13. Plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence that the Department of Justice has employed the\n\n\"purpose\" prong inappropriately after the 1990s round of districting, and the Court will not\n\npresume that the Department will violate the law. See Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 679\n\n(1971). If that presumption proves wrong, an as-applied challenge may be brought in the\n\nappropriate case.\n\n       2. Subsections (b) and (d)\n\n       There are two reasons that the amendments in subsections (b) and (d) could raise equal\n\nprotection concerns. First, there is the possibility that the amendments function as a \"facial\n\nquota-preference for minorities,\" as plaintiffs put it. Plfs.' Opp. at 24. As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained in other contexts, quotas and rigid minority-preference schemes violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause. See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 258, 269 n.18, 271-72 (2003)\n\n(citing Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978)).\n\n       More abstractly, there is the possibility that subsections (b) and (d) mandate excessive\n\ngovernmental race consciousness in violation of equal protection principles. A plurality of the\n\nSupreme Court raised this possibility in a discussion of the necessary prerequisites for bringing a\n\n\n\n                                                82\n\fSection 2 claim in LULAC, where plaintiffs brought a Section 2 claim in response to a\n\nredistricting plan that, among other things, redrew what had been an African-American influence\n\ndistrict. 548 U.S. at 445-46. Writing for three members of the Court, Justice Kennedy explained\n\nthat the fact \"[t]hat African-Americans had influence in the district does not suffice to state a § 2\n\nclaim in these cases. . . . If § 2 were interpreted to protect this kind of influence, it would\n\nunnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional\n\nquestions.\" Id. (citing Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 491 (Kennedy, J., concurring)). Justice Kennedy\n\nhad expressed similar concerns in his separate concurrence in Ashcroft:\n\n        As is evident from the Court's accurate description of the facts in this case, race\n        was a predominant factor in drawing the lines of Georgia's State Senate\n        redistricting map. If the Court's statement of facts had been written as the preface\n        to consideration of a challenge brought under the Equal Protection Clause or\n        under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a reader of the opinion would have\n        had sound reason to conclude that the challenge would succeed. Race cannot be\n        the predominant factor in redistricting under our decision in Miller v. Johnson,\n        515 U.S. 900 (1995). Yet considerations of race that would doom a redistricting\n        plan under the Fourteenth Amendment or § 2 seem to be what save it under § 5.\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. at 491 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Although neither Justice Kennedy's\n\nconcurrence nor the plurality decision in LULAC spelled out the details of the equal protection\n\nissue, the concern appears to be that excessive consideration of race by the federal government\n\nmay cause the sort of stigmatic harms discussed in Shaw I and Miller.\n\n        In evaluating whether subsections (b) and (d) violate equal protection principles, a key\n\npoint to keep in mind is the narrowness of plaintiffs' challenge. Count II challenges only the\n\n2006 amendments to Section 5. It does not argue that the entire non-retrogression principle is\n\ninvalid, only that Ashcroft's refinement of that principle is constitutionally indispensable. See\n\nLaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 794 (\"Significantly, plaintiffs do not contest the constitutionality of the\n\n\n\n                                                  83\n\fpre-2006 preclearance standards articulated in Georgia v. Ashcroft and Bossier Parish.\"). That\n\nis, plaintiffs contend that the retrogression principle complies with the equal protection\n\ncomponent of the Fifth Amendment only if, as Ashcroft decreed, (1) states may trade influence\n\ndistricts for opportunity districts and (2) courts and the Justice Department can take into account\n\nother jurisdiction-specific factors, such as minority-preferred legislators' views of proposed\n\nvoting changes, in making preclearance decisions. While plaintiffs' briefing on this argument is\n\ncursory, see Plfs.' MSJ at 44-45, their argument is presumably that the Ashcroft standard is a\n\nnarrowly tailored response to the government's compelling interest, but that subsections (b) and\n\n(d) are not.\n\n        Given that plaintiffs do not challenge the general retrogression principle, they may have\n\nconceded that the government indeed has a compelling interest in remedying discrimination in\n\nvoting. But even if plaintiffs do not concede that point, the Court would conclude that Congress\n\ndoes in fact have such a compelling interest. Congress has identified historical and ongoing\n\nintentional discrimination that strikes at the heart of two of the most important rights protected\n\nby the Constitution -- the right to vote and the right to be free from governmental discrimination\n\nbased on race. Congress heard testimony in 2005 and 2006 that intentionally dilutive techniques\n\nhave been used as long as minorities have been able to vote. Witness testimony and other record\n\nevidence indicated that discriminatory, dilutive efforts are ongoing in covered jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover, Congress received evidence that such efforts would increase in the absence of Section\n\n5's deterrent effect.\n\n        The Supreme Court has recognized that \"remedying the effects of past intentional\n\ndiscrimination\" can be a compelling interest. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 720 (citing Freeman\n\n\n\n                                                 84\n\fv. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992)). This recognition has been particularly clear in the school\n\ndesegregation cases that followed in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483\n\n(1954), and the Court finds that those cases provide important guidance here. In Swann v.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 25 (1971), the Supreme Court approved\n\nthe use of \"mathematical ratios\" for student body racial composition \"as a starting point in the\n\nprocess of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement.\" In explaining why limited\n\nuse of such ratios was appropriate under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court said:\n\n       Absent a constitutional violation there would be no basis for judicially ordering\n       assignment on a racial basis. All things being equal, with no history of\n       discrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their\n       homes. But all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately\n       constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation. The remedy for such\n       segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in\n       some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and\n       inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments\n       are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.\n\nId. at 28. The Court also noted that facially \"'racially neutral' assignment plans proposed by\n\nschool authorities . . . may be inadequate\" to remedy the problems caused by past segregation.\n\nId. These observations assist the analysis in the voting rights context.\n\n       The Supreme Court has also held that racial classifications can be used to remedy past\n\ndiscrimination outside the school desegregation context. In United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S.\n\n149, 163, 166 (1987), for example, every member of the Court agreed that racial classifications\n\ncould sometimes be used to remedy past discrimination, and a majority of the Court approved a\n\nrule that a state agency that had systematically excluded blacks from promotion had to award\n\n50% of promotions to qualified black candidates until the agency developed an acceptable\n\nalternative plan. In Adarand v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 237, 243, 269 (1995), seven members of the\n\n\n\n                                                85\n\fCourt concluded that racial classifications could be used to remedy past discrimination, and the\n\nCourt remanded to the lower court to decide whether a particular federal preference program for\n\nminority subcontractors was appropriate.\n\n       The Supreme Court has, however, limited in several ways the government's ability to use\n\nracial classifications even as a remedy. Mere invocation of the word \"remedial\" cannot justify\n\nany use of racial classifications that the government desires. See Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at\n\n720-21. For instance, a school district that has never imposed de jure segregation, or that has\n\nachieved unitary status, cannot invoke remedial justifications for classifying students by race.\n\nId. Moreover, as Swann recognized, \"there are limits\" to the use of racial classifications even to\n\nremedy de jure segregation. 402 U.S. at 28. The Swann Court explained that if \"we were to read\n\nthe holding of the District Court [mandating certain actions to desegregate schools] to require, as\n\na matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that\n\napproach would be disapproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" Id. Justice Kennedy,\n\nconcurring in Parents Involved, repeated the same points: \"The Court has allowed school\n\ndistricts to remedy their prior de jure segregation by classifying individual students based on\n\ntheir race. . . . The remedy, though, was limited in time and limited to the wrong.\" 551 U.S. at\n\n796 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n       The Supreme Court has also ensured that remedial race-conscious measures are closely\n\ntied to the harms caused by discrimination by requiring express findings of official\n\ndiscrimination before allowing state and local governments to use race-conscious remedies. See,\n\ne.g., City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 489 (1989). In the case of such use of\n\nrace-conscious remedies by the federal government, the Court has \"recognized the special\n\n\n\n                                                 86\n\fcompetence of Congress to make findings with respect to the effects of identified past\n\ndiscrimination and its discretionary authority to take appropriate remedial measures.\" Regents of\n\nthe Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 302 n.41 (1978); see also Adarand, 515 U.S. at 230-31\n\n(noting that application of strict scrutiny to Congress's use of racial classifications does not\n\npreclude some deference to Congress's exercise of its enforcement authority). The Supreme\n\nCourt has also suggested, however, that Congress is not obliged to make such findings, as state\n\nand local governments are, because the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments enlarge its power\n\nrather than restricting it. See J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 490; but see Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n\n224, 226-31; see also id. at 264-65 (Souter, J., dissenting). Justice Scalia, concurring in J.A.\n\nCroson Co., elaborated on that point: \"[I]t is one thing to permit racially based conduct by the\n\nFederal Government -- whose legislative powers on their face were explicitly enhanced by the\n\nFourteenth Amendment -- and quite another to permit it by the precise entities against whose\n\nconduct in matters of race that Amendment was specifically directed.\" Id. at 521-22 (internal\n\ncitations omitted). Justice Scalia also pointed out that \"a sound distinction between federal and\n\nstate (or local) action based upon race rests not only upon the substance of the Civil War\n\nAmendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory,\" because \"[t]he struggle for\n\nracial justice has historically been a struggle by the national society against oppression in the\n\nindividual States . . . . And the struggle retains that character in modern times.\" Id. at 522.\n\n       Even under the limitations the Supreme Court has imposed on the remedial use of race,\n\nthe Court concludes that Congress has a compelling interest here in remedying prior state- and\n\nlocal government-sponsored racial discrimination -- and, even more importantly, in preventing\n\nthe ongoing discriminatory efforts Congress identified. Intentional vote dilution, like school\n\n\n\n                                                  87\n\fsegregation, is one of the most pernicious forms of de jure discrimination against minorities, and\n\nCongress is entitled to remedy any \"harm that is traceable to\" that intentional discrimination.\n\nParents Involved, 551 U.S. at 721. Identifying the harm \"traceable to\" discrimination is, of\n\ncourse, more complicated in the voting context than in the de jure school segregation context, as\n\njurisdictions do not generally openly announce voting discrimination in the same way that school\n\nsegregation was announced. But Congress compiled an extensive legislative record that tied the\n\nremedies to areas of de jure discrimination in voting; it also relied on past legislative records\n\nfinding intentional discrimination in covered jurisdictions. In doing so, Congress exercised its\n\n\"special competence . . . to make findings with respect to the effects of identified past\n\ndiscrimination\" and its latitude \"to take appropriate remedial measures.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 302\n\nn.41.\n\n        \"All things being equal, with no history of discrimination,\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 28,\n\nCongress would have no interest in such supervision of state voting procedures. \"But all things\n\nare not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial\n\nsegregation.\" Id. In light of the extensive record compiled by Congress in 2005 and 2006, the\n\nCourt finds that Congress has a compelling interest in crafting a remedy to address past and\n\nongoing discrimination in voting.\n\n        The remaining question is whether the amendments contained in subsections (b) and (d)\n\nare sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieving Congress's interests without unnecessary reliance\n\non racial classifications. It bears repeating that plaintiffs have not challenged Ashcroft's\n\ninterpretation of the retrogression standard, so the question before the Court is whether the\n\nmodification of the Ashcroft standard in subsections (b) and (d) -- eliminating consideration of\n\n\n\n                                                 88\n\finfluence districts and other factors unrelated to minorities' \"ability to elect\" -- dooms the\n\namendments on narrow tailoring grounds. The Court finds that it does not. Plaintiffs' primary\n\ncomplaint is that the amendments create an inflexible quota, but the Court is not persuaded that\n\nsubsections (b) and (d) make the Section 5 analysis less flexible. It is true that states can no\n\nlonger substitute influence districts for opportunity districts, but there is no longer any concern\n\nthat influence districts will be protected from retrogression and frozen in place. See LULAC,\n\n548 U.S. at 446; see also, e.g., Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 56, 101(May 16, 2006) (witnesses\n\nagreeing that influence districts need not be protected from retrogression under the new\n\nstandard); Thernstrom, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 5 GEO. J.L. & PUB. POL'Y at 71.\n\n       Even if the amendments do make Section 5 less flexible, they still do not create the facial\n\nquota of which plaintiffs complain. As defendant points out, subsections (b) and (d) did not\n\noverturn the prior Section 5 caselaw that provided that there could not be an \"utterly inflexible\n\nprohibition on retrogression.\" Def.'s Opp. at 39 (citing City of Richmond v. United States, 422\n\nU.S. 358, 370-72 (1975)). Even before Ashcroft, the Department had stated that it did not\n\n\"require the reflexive imposition of objections in total disregard of the circumstances involved or\n\nthe legitimate justifications in support of changes that incidentally may be less favorable to\n\nminority voters.\" Revision of Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 of the Voting\n\nRights Act of 1965, 52 Fed. Reg. 486, 488 (Jan. 6, 1987)). In its current regulations, the Justice\n\nDepartment has similarly acknowledged that it must consider \"the extent to which a reasonable\n\nand legitimate justification for the change exists.\" 28 C.F.R. § 51.57(a). Recent guidelines\n\nissued by the Department state that retrogression may be \"unavoidable\" due to \"shifts in\n\npopulation or other significant changes since the last redistricting (e.g., residential segregation\n\n\n\n                                                 89\n\fand demographic distribution of the population within the jurisdiction, the physical geography of\n\nthe jurisdiction, the jurisdiction's historical redistricting practices, political boundaries, such as\n\ncities or counties, and/or state redistricting requirements).\" Guidance Concerning Redistricting\n\nUnder Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7470, at 7472 (Feb. 9, 2011). In such\n\nsituations, retrogressive plans may be precleared when the jurisdiction demonstrates that \"a\n\nless-retrogressive plan cannot reasonably be drawn.\" Id. Finally, retrogressive plans must be\n\nprecleared when avoiding retrogression would require a district to violate Shaw I and Miller. Id.\n\nHence, whatever race-consciousness is mandated by subsections (b) and (d) resembles the\n\nflexible mathematical ratios approved in Swann more than it resembles an inflexible quota. See\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 25. Certainly, the standard laid out in subsections (b) and (d) is more\n\nflexible than the 50% promotion rule approved in Paradise. See 480 U.S. at 163-64.\n\n        Statutes may be invalidated on tailoring grounds when the challengers can suggest a\n\nnarrower alternative that would be successful in curing the identified problem. See United States\n\nv. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000). Other than pointing to the Ashcroft\n\nstandard, plaintiffs here have not attempted to do so. But Congress justifiably decided that\n\nAshcroft's interpretation of the effects prong would not remedy the problems of intentional vote\n\ndilution that it identified. As the record before Congress confirmed, Ashcroft gave jurisdictions\n\ngreater leeway to disguise intentional discrimination and it created significant administrability,\n\nsubjectivity, and partisanship problems. Hence, Ashcroft -- whether it was more or less narrow\n\nthan subsections (b) and (d) -- was not \"tailored\" to achieve Congress's ends. Plaintiffs' failure to\n\noffer hypothetical alternative amendments that would cure the Ashcroft problems but be\n\nnarrower than (b) and (d) may reflect the difficulty of imagining what such amendments would\n\n\n\n                                                   90\n\fbe. As previously explained, the 2006 amendments respond to specific problems in the Ashcroft\n\nholding in a relatively discrete way, so there is not much ground between the Ashcroft standard\n\nthat is acceptable to plaintiffs and the amendments that they challenge. The Court therefore\n\nfinds that the 2006 amendments in subsections (b) and (d) are narrowly tailored to respond to the\n\nhistorical and ongoing problems of voting discrimination identified by Congress.\n\n       As to the second basis for an equal protection challenge -- that race is \"infuse[d] . . . into\n\nvirtually every redistricting,\" LULAC, 548 U.S. at 446 -- the amendments are actually an\n\nimprovement over the Ashcroft standard. Under Ashcroft, states might have had to protect\n\ninfluence districts from retrogression in the same way that opportunity districts were protected.\n\nSection 5's non-retrogression principle would thus have come into play in every influence district\n\nas well as every opportunity district. Given how many districts could conceivably be defined as\n\ninfluence districts, race could truly have been infused into \"virtually every redistricting.\"\n\nMoreover, under the Ashcroft standard, the Justice Department would have had to obtain the\n\nviews of minority voters and minority-preferred candidates on any proposed election change -- a\n\nconsiderably broader and more unwieldy undertaking than the purpose or effects test, and one\n\nthat would have required an even more racially-inflected view of elections. See supra note 8\n\n(citing Letter from R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant Attorney General, to C. Havird Jones, Jr.,\n\nSenior Assistant Attorney General (Feb. 26, 2004)).\n\n       For the reasons previously explained, the Court does not believe that an explicitly racial\n\nproblem can be resolved with no reference to race. To that extent, then, race must be infused\n\ninto at least some redistricting processes for the duration of the amended Section 5. Cf. Swann,\n\n402 U.S. at 28 (remedying de jure segregation may be \"administratively awkward, inconvenient,\n\n\n\n                                                 91\n\fand even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and\n\ninconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being\n\nmade to eliminate\" the vestiges of segregation). But Congress restricted the scope of the racial\n\ninquiry when it enacted the 2006 amendments contained in subsection (b) and (d), while at the\n\nsame time tailoring the amendments to respond as effectively as possible to the problems of\n\nracial discrimination in voting. The Court finds that doing so was not a violation of equal\n\nprotection.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       This Court explained in Shelby County that Congress, the \"coequal and representative\n\nbranch of our Government,\" has the preeminent constitutional role under the Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments in determining the legislation needed to enforce those Amendments'\n\nguarantees. See Shelby County, 2011 WL 4375001, at *80; Walters v. National Ass'n of\n\nRadiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 319 (1985); see also Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2513.\n\nCongress emphatically determined that the amendments were indeed necessary to enforce the\n\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments' guarantees: the amended Section 5 passed by a vote of\n\n390 to 33 in the House and 98 to 0 in the Senate. See 152 Cong. Rec. S8012 (daily ed. July 20,\n\n2006); 152 Cong. Rec. H5143-5207 (daily ed. July 13, 2006). And, as the Court found with\n\nrespect to the challenge to the reauthorization of the preclearance regime as a whole, Congress\n\ncarefully and extensively justified its decisions to amend the statute to overturn or modify two\n\nSupreme Court decisions interpreting Section 5. This Court declines to overturn that careful,\n\nwell-supported judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                92\n\f       For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment,\n\nand grant the motions for summary judgment filed by the Attorney General and the defendant-\n\nintervenors. A separate order has been filed on this date.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    /s/\n                                                            JOHN D.

HOLDER, Jr., in his official\n capacity as Attorney General of the United\n States,\n\n        Defendant.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiffs, four private citizens and a private membership association, bring a facial\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973c, and the 2006 amendments to Section 5, 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b)-(d). Section 5, as amended,\n\nprevents certain \"covered\" jurisdictions from implementing any change to voting practices or\n\nprocedures unless and until the jurisdiction demonstrates to federal authorities that the change\n\n\"neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on\n\naccount of race or color.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a).\n\n       Plaintiffs are residents of Kinston, North Carolina. In November 2008, Kinston voters\n\nadopted a referendum that would have replaced the city's current partisan electoral system with a\n\nnonpartisan system, in which anyone could run for local office and no candidate would be\n\naffiliated with any political party on the ballot. See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 14-15. Because Kinston is a\n\ncovered jurisdiction under Section 5, it submitted its proposed voting change to the Attorney\n\nGeneral for \"preclearance\" (i.e., approval) under Section 5. The Attorney General declined to\n\n                                                 1\n\fpreclear the referendum on the ground that \"elimination of party affiliation on the ballot will\n\nlikely reduce the ability of blacks to elect candidates of choice.\" Id. ¶ 19. Kinston did not seek\n\nadministrative reconsideration of the Attorney General's objection, nor did it seek a declaratory\n\njudgment from this Court authorizing the proposed electoral change. In April 2010, however,\n\nplaintiffs, proponents of the nonpartisan-election referendum, filed this action. Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat Section 5, as reauthorized and as amended in 2006, exceeds Congress's enforcement\n\nauthority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments (Count I) and that the 2006\n\namendments to Section 5 violate the nondiscrimination guarantees of the Fifth, Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments (Count II). See id. ¶¶ 1, 33-34, 36-37.\n\n       On December 20, 2010, this Court granted defendant's Motion to Dismiss [Docket Entry\n\n11] on the ground that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims. See LaRoque v. Holder,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2470781\"><a href=\"/opinion/2470781/laroque-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Circuit reversed,\n\nconcluding that plaintiffs had standing to bring Count I and directing this Court to consider the\n\nmerits of that claim. LaRoque v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"220587\"><a href=\"/opinion/220587/laroque-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793, 796 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (\"LaRoque\n\nII\"). The D.C. Circuit also directed this Court to consider whether plaintiffs had standing to\n\nbring Count II, and, if so, to resolve the merits of that claim. Id. at 795-96. Shortly after the\n\nD.C. Circuit's decision, this Court decided another challenge to Section 5 brought by Shelby\n\nCounty, Alabama, in an opinion that involved some of the same issues raised here. Shelby\n\nCnty., Ala. v. Holder, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, No. 10-651, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. Sept. 21,\n\n2011). This Court concluded in Shelby County that Congress did not exceed its enforcement\n\npowers in reauthorizing Section 5's preclearance procedure in 2006. That decision resolves part\n\nof plaintiffs' Count I claim here.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f        Two of plaintiffs' remaining contentions, however, raise significant issues that have not\n\nbeen addressed in any other decision on Section 5 and the Voting Rights Act. These claims\n\nrevolve around three amendments to Section 5 that Congress enacted in 2006. 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973c(b)-(d). The three amendments made two substantive changes to the standard applied in\n\ndeciding whether a voting practice or procedure should be precleared under Section 5. Plaintiffs\n\ncontend that the 2006 amendments exceed Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth\n\nand Fifteenth Amendments -- an argument no other challenger to the reauthorization of Section 5\n\nhas raised. Plaintiffs also contend that the amendments violate the equal protection component\n\nof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the federal government's equivalent of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This appears to be the first facial\n\nchallenge to a portion of Section 5 under equal protection principles. It is perhaps startling that\n\nplaintiffs claim that Section 5, a law \"[p]raised by some as the centerpiece of the most effective\n\ncivil rights legislation ever enacted,\" is actually racially discriminatory. See Shelby County,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. Nonetheless, plaintiffs argue that Congress, in its effort to counteract\n\nyears of discrimination against minority voters, has overreached and harmed the interests of\n\nwhite voters like plaintiffs.\n\n        These two challenges call for different analyses and implicate different sets of caselaw,\n\nbut both, at bottom, ask how urgent the need for Congressional legislation was in 2006 and how\n\nwell Congress crafted the challenged legislation. Guided by the abundant Congressional record\n\nand the Supreme Court's caselaw on Congress's enforcement powers and equal protection\n\nprinciples, this Court concludes that the 2006 amendments to Section 5 are a careful solution to a\n\nvitally important problem. It therefore holds that the amendments do not violate the Constitution\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fand that plaintiffs' facial challenges must be denied.\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n                               I. History of the Voting Rights Act\n\n       The history of the Voting Rights Act, and of Section 5 in particular, was discussed at\n\nlength in this Court's opinion in Shelby County. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2-15. That history need\n\nnot be repeated in full here, but a few important points bear emphasis. The Voting Rights Act\n\n(\"the Act\" or \"the VRA\") \"was designed by Congress to banish the blight of racial discrimination\n\nin voting.\" South Carolina v. Katzenbach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107182\"><a href=\"/opinion/107182/south-carolina-v-katzenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (1966). The Act's core prohibition\n\nagainst racial discrimination in voting is contained in Section 2, which provides that \"[n]o voting\n\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\n\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement\n\nof the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973. Section 2 and many other provisions of the Voting Rights Act are permanent and apply\n\nnationwide.\n\n       In addition to the permanent, nationwide provisions, Sections 4(b) and 5 of Act impose\n\nadditional requirements on certain \"covered\" jurisdictions. Section 4(b) determines which\n\njurisdictions qualify as \"covered.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(b). Section 5 provides that a covered\n\njurisdiction cannot make any changes to its voting qualifications, standards, practices, or\n\nprocedures unless those changes are first \"submitted to and approved by a three-judge Federal\n\nDistrict Court in Washington, D.C., or the Attorney General.\" Nw.

Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2509 (quoting 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1973c(a)). Section 5 \"shift[s] the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil\n\nto its victims,\" Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 328, by requiring covered jurisdictions to show that\n\nchanges are not discriminatory before they are enacted.\n\n       Section 5 was originally scheduled to sunset after five years, but Congress reauthorized it\n\nin 1970 (for five years), 1975 (for seven years), 1982 (for twenty-five years), and 2006 (for\n\ntwenty-five years). Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2510. During the 2006 reauthorization,\n\nCongress enacted three amendments to Section 5 that made two substantive changes to the scope\n\nof the preclearance provision. Because of the importance of those changes to this litigation, the\n\nportion of the Shelby County opinion describing the 2006 amendments is repeated in full here.\n\n       In the amendment codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(c), Congress clarified its intent with\n\nrespect to the meaning of the word \"purpose\" in Section 5 in response to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118334\"><a href=\"/opinion/118334/reno-v-bossier-parish-school-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000) (\"Bossier II\"). Section 5,\n\nby its terms, only allows a voting change to be precleared if the change \"neither has the purpose\n\nnor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\"\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a). Prior to Bossier II, this provision was interpreted to bar preclearance\n\nof voting changes that either (1) were enacted with a discriminatory purpose; or (2) had a\n\ndiscriminatory, retrogressive effect -- i.e., changes that worsened the position of minority voters\n\nrelative to the status quo. See Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 324 (explaining that a redistricting plan\n\nonly has a prohibited discriminatory \"effect\" under Section 5 if it is retrogressive); Beer v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109418\"><a href=\"/opinion/109418/beer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (1976) (noting that \"the purpose of s[ection] 5 has always been\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fto insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that would lead to a retrogression in\n\nthe position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise\"). In Bossier II, however, the Supreme Court -- for the first time -- held that the\n\n\"purpose\" prong of Section 5 only prohibits electoral changes that are enacted with a\n\ndiscriminatory and retrogressive purpose. See 528 U.S. at 341. In other words, after Bossier II,\n\na redistricting plan that was passed for purely discriminatory reasons (such as to purposefully\n\navoid the creation of a new majority-minority district), but that was not intended to make\n\nminority voters any worse off than they had been under the preexisting plan (which, say, had no\n\nmajority-minority districts), would not run afoul of Section 5's \"purpose\" prong. See id.\n\n(holding that Section 5 \"does not prohibit preclearance of a redistricting plan with a\n\ndiscriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose\").\n\n       Bossier II thus had the effect of reading the \"purpose\" prong \"almost entirely out of\n\nSection 5.\" See House Hearing, 109th Cong. 12 (Nov. 1, 2005) (prepared statement of Mark A.\n\nPosner).1 As was the case prior to Bossier II, if a jurisdiction enacted an electoral change that\n\nreduced the ability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice, the change would be\n\ndenied preclearance under Section 5's \"effects\" prong (because it would have a retrogressive\n\neffect). Under Bossier II, then, the \"purpose\" prong would only serve as an independent bar to\n\ndiscriminatory voting changes where a jurisdiction \"intend[ed] to cause retrogression, but then,\n\nsomehow, messe[d] up and enact[ed] a voting change that [did] not actually cause retrogression\n\nto occur (the so-called 'incompetent retrogressor').\" Id.\n\n\n       1\n          For readability, the Court will use this short form for the many legislative hearings\ncited throughout this opinion. An appendix to the opinion provides the full citation for each\nhearing, along with information on where to find electronic copies of the hearings.\n\n                                                  6\n\f        In 2006, the House Judiciary Committee explained that Bossier II's limitation of the\n\n\"purpose\" prong had been inconsistent with Congress's intent that Section 5 prevent not only\n\npurposefully retrogressive discriminatory voting changes, but also those \"[v]oting changes that\n\n'purposefully' keep minority groups 'in their place.'\" See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 68.\n\nAccordingly, as part of the 2006 Amendments, Congress restored the pre-Bossier II \"purpose\"\n\nstandard by adding a provision to the statute that defined \"purpose\" in Section 5 to mean \"any\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\" See Pub. L. No. 109-246, § 5(c), 120 Stat. 577, 581 (2006); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(c) (emphasis added).\n\n         In a similar vein, Congress also responded to the Supreme Court's decision in Georgia v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130158\"><a href=\"/opinion/130158/georgia-v-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), which had altered the preexisting standard for determining\n\nwhether a voting change had a prohibited retrogressive effect under Section 5's \"effects\" prong.\n\nPrior to Georgia v. Ashcroft, the standard for assessing whether an electoral change violated the\n\nSection 5 \"effects\" test was \"'whether the ability of minority groups to participate in the political\n\nprocess and to elect their choices to office is . . . diminished . . . by the change affecting voting.'\"\n\nBeer, 425 U.S. at 141(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-196, at 60) (emphasis omitted). In Georgia v.\n\nAshcroft, however, the Court endorsed a less rigid, \"totality of the circumstances\" analysis for\n\nexamining retrogressive effects, explaining that \"any assessment of the retrogression of a\n\nminority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise depends on an examination of all\n\nthe relevant circumstances, such as the ability of minority voters to elect their candidate of\n\nchoice, the extent of the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political process, and\n\nthe feasibility of creating a nonretrogressive plan.\" 539 U.S. at 479. In reauthorizing the Act in\n\n2006, Congress expressed concern that the Georgia v. Ashcroft framework had introduced\n\n\n                                                   7\n\f\"substantial uncertainty\" into the administration of a statute that was \"specifically intended to\n\nblock persistent and shifting efforts to limit the effectiveness of minority political participation.\"\n\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 70 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Hence, in an\n\nattempt to restore the simpler, \"ability to elect\" analysis articulated in Beer, see id. at 71,\n\nCongress added new language to the Act, stating that all voting changes that diminish the ability\n\nof minorities \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice\" should be denied preclearance under\n\nSection 5. See Pub. L. No. 109-246, §§ 5(b), (d), 120 Stat. at 581; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973c(b), (d).\n\n                                    II.

Kinston, North Carolina\n\n        The plaintiffs in this case filed their complaint on April 7, 2010, a few weeks before\n\nShelby County was filed. See Compl. at 13. As described in this Court's previous opinion in\n\nthis case, see LaRoque I, 755 F. Supp. 2d at 156, the present action stems from an attempt by\n\nvoters in the city of Kinston, North Carolina to alter the partisan nature of Kinston's local\n\nelection system. See Compl. ¶ 1. Currently, a prospective candidate for political office in\n\nKinston must either be the winner of a party primary or an unaffiliated candidate who obtains a\n\nsufficient number of signatures to have his or her name placed on the ballot. See id. In\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fNovember 2008, Kinston voters -- by an almost 2 to 1 margin -- passed a referendum that would\n\nhave amended the Kinston city charter to allow for nonpartisan elections, under which any\n\nindividual would be allowed to run for local political office and no candidate would be affiliated\n\nwith any political party on the ballot. See id. ¶¶ 1, 14-15.\n\n       Kinston is a political subdivision of Lenoir County, North Carolina, which is a covered\n\njurisdiction, and hence Kinston, too, is subject to the provisions of Section 5. See Compl. ¶ 16;\n\n28 C.F.R. pt. 51, 30 Fed. Reg. 9897 (Aug. 7, 1965) (Section 5 coverage determination for Lenoir\n\nCounty, North Carolina); 28 C.F.R. § 51.6 (noting that \"all political subunits within a covered\n\njurisdiction . . . are subject to the requirement of section 5\"). Rather than seek bailout under\n\nSection 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act, or a declaratory judgment from a three-judge panel of this\n\nCourt authorizing its proposed electoral change, Kinston submitted the proposed change to the\n\nAttorney General for preclearance. See Compl. ¶ 16. On August 17, 2009, the Attorney General\n\nissued a letter objecting to Kinston's proposed system of nonpartisan elections, on the ground\n\nthat the \"elimination of party affiliation on the ballot will likely reduce the ability of blacks to\n\nelect candidates of choice.\" Def.'s Mem. in Opp. to Plfs.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Opp.\")\n\n[Docket Entry 55], Statement of Facts, Ex. 2, at 2 (objection letter). As the Attorney General\n\nexplained, minority-preferred candidates in Kinston tend to be Democrats. Id. Statistical\n\nanalysis showed that such minority-preferred candidates needed a small amount of white\n\ncrossover voting to be elected, but that most white voters -- even Democrats -- would vote for a\n\nwhite Republican over a black Democrat. Id. Some white Democrats, however, \"maintain[ed]\n\nstrong party allegiance and w[ould] continue to vote along party lines, regardless of the race of\n\nthe candidate,\" often by voting a straight Democratic ticket. Id. The Attorney General found\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fthat switching to a nonpartisan election system would eliminate minority-preferred candidates'\n\nability to \"appeal to [Democratic] party loyalty\" and to benefit from straight-ticket voting. Id.\n\nHence, \"[r]emoving the partisan cue in municipal elections will, in all likelihood, eliminate the\n\nsingle factor that allows black candidates to be elected to office.\" Id. The Attorney General\n\ntherefore refused to preclear the referendum. Id. at 3. On November 16, 2009, the Kinston City\n\nCouncil voted not to seek administrative reconsideration of the Attorney General's objection or a\n\nde novo review by this Court of Kinston's proposed change to nonpartisan elections. See Def.'s\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss [Docket 11], Ex. 1, Kinston City Council Meeting Minutes, at\n\n19.\n\n       Plaintiffs then filed this suit against the Attorney General. Plaintiffs are four2 Kinston\n\nresidents who are registered voters there, as well as a private membership association, the\n\nKinston Citizens for Non-Partisan Voting (\"KCNV\"), which is \"dedicated to eliminating the use\n\nof partisan affiliation in Kinston municipal elections.\" Compl. ¶¶ 2-7. The citizen-plaintiffs all\n\nallege that they either campaigned or voted for the November 2008 referendum. See id. ¶¶ 2-6.\n\nTwo of the five claimed that they intended to run for election to the Kinston City Council in\n\nNovember 2011; one of those later dropped out of the race. Id. ¶¶ 3-4; Plfs.' Notice of Filing at 1\n\n[Docket Entry 57]. The remaining candidate, John Nix, alleges that as a registered Republican\n\nvoter running for office in a predominantly Democratic jurisdiction he has \"a direct interest\" in\n\nrunning \"on a ballot where he is unaffiliated with any party, against opponents similarly\n\nunaffiliated, and without the preliminary need to either run in a party primary or obtain sufficient\n\nsignatures to obtain access to the ballot as a candidate.\" Compl. ¶ 3. All plaintiffs allege that the\n\n       2\n         The complaint lists five citizen plaintiffs, but plaintiff Lee Raynor died on February 20,\n2011. Plfs.' Notice of Filing at 1 [Docket Entry 57].\n\n                                                 11\n\fAttorney General's \"denial of Section 5 preclearance . . . completely nullified all of Plaintiffs'\n\nefforts in support of the referendum.\" Id. ¶ 29. Plaintiffs further allege that Congress exceeded\n\nits enforcement power in reauthorizing Section 5; that Congress exceeded its enforcement power\n\nin enacting the amendments to Section 5 in 2006; and that the 2006 amendments violate the\n\nequal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Id. ¶¶ 1, 33-34,\n\n36-37. Although plaintiffs' complaint clearly raised as-applied claims, they insisted during the\n\nfirst motions hearing in this case that they were raising only facial challenges to the statute. See\n\nLaRoque I, 755 F. Supp. 2d at 162-63; see also LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 783.\n\n       Six African-American Kinston residents, along with the North Carolina State Conference\n\nof Branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, joined the case\n\nin August 2010 as intervenors in support of the Attorney General. See Order Granting Tyson, et\n\nal.'s Mot. to Intervene [Docket Entry 24]. On December 16, 2010, this Court granted the\n\ngovernment's Motion to Dismiss, and on December 20, 2010, the Court issued a memorandum\n\norder explaining that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this challenge. [Docket Entries 41, 42.]\n\nThe Court made separate findings as to the referendum proponents, prospective candidates, and\n\nvoters. First, the Court found that the weight of caselaw holds that referendum proponents do\n\nnot suffer a concrete injury that confers standing to sue when a later action allegedly nullifies the\n\neffect of their ballot initiative. LaRoque I, 759 F. Supp. 2d at 169-73. Second, the Court found\n\nthat whether the two proposed candidates would actually run was too speculative to support\n\nstanding. Id. at 173-75. It further found that the prospective candidates had no legally protected\n\ninterest in a nonpartisan electoral system because they did not allege that partisan electoral\n\nsystems were illegal. Id. at 175-80. Third, the Court found that the voters had alleged too\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fgeneral an injury to their associational rights to support standing, and that they were not\n\nprevented from supporting the candidates of their choice. Id. at 180-82. Finally, the Court found\n\nthat holding Section 5 unconstitutional would not revive the Kinston referendum, and that\n\nplaintiffs' claims were therefore not redressable. Id. at 182-83.\n\n       Plaintiffs appealed and the D.C. Circuit reversed. Treating plaintiffs' claims as purely\n\nfacial, the D.C. Circuit addressed only whether Nix, the prospective candidate, had standing.\n\n650 F.3d at 783. As relevant here, the D.C. Circuit examined the record and found that it was\n\nnot unduly speculative that Nix would run for office. Id. at 788-89. The D.C. Circuit further\n\nfound that the passage of the referendum had granted Nix a legally protected interest in a\n\nnonpartisan election system. Id. at 786. Finally, the court explained that if Section 5 were\n\nunconstitutional, the Attorney General's actions pursuit to it would be ultra vires and void. Id. at\n\n790-91. The Attorney General's objection to the referendum would therefore be void, and the\n\nreferendum would go into effect as if the objection had never happened. Id. Hence, the D.C.\n\nCircuit concluded that Nix had standing to pursue the Count I claim that the reauthorization of\n\nSection 5 exceeded Congress's enforcement powers. Id. at 792.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit declined, however, to decide whether any plaintiff had standing to bring\n\nCount II. Id. at 793-96. The court explained that Count II raised complex standing questions\n\nthat had not been fully briefed in either the district court or the court of appeals. Id. In\n\nparticular, Count II challenged only the amendments to Section 5, and it was unclear whether a\n\nfinding that the amendments were unconstitutional would revive the referendum. Id. at 794-95.\n\nThe court of appeals further questioned whether, given that plaintiffs' equal protection challenge\n\nwas only facial, plaintiffs had \"met the requirement that litigants claiming injury from a racial\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fclassification establish that they 'personally [have been] denied equal treatment by the\n\nchallenged discriminatory conduct.'\" Id. at 795 (quoting United States v. Hays, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117965\"><a href=\"/opinion/117965/united-states-v-hays/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n743-44 (1995)). The court stated that\n\n       [w]ithout meaningful briefing on these issues, we are hesitant to decide plaintiffs'\n       count-two standing. Of course, we could ask for additional briefing. But that\n       would take time, and as plaintiffs' repeated requests for us to expedite this\n       litigation so that it can be resolved before the November 2011 election indicate,\n       time is of the essence. Given this, and given that plaintiffs themselves\n       characterize count two as a fallback position, see Oral Arg. Tr. at 13:2-4, 15:11-\n       15 (characterizing count two as an “alternative claim[]” that plaintiffs brought in\n       case they lose on count one), we are reluctant to consume precious time resolving\n       plaintiffs' standing to bring count two -- time the district court could instead\n       devote to considering the merits of plaintiffs' principal argument, asserted in\n       count one, that Congress's 2006 reauthorization of section 5 exceeded its\n       Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment enforcement powers.\n\n650 F.3d at 796. Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit remanded to this Court to consider the merits of\n\nCount I and whether plaintiffs had standing to pursue Count II. Id.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n                                         I. OVERVIEW\n\n       Before addressing the merits of plaintiffs' claims, the Court must address one unusual and\n\nimportant issue that has arisen in this case. When this Court originally granted defendant's\n\nMotion to Dismiss, the Court read plaintiffs' complaint as arguing that Congress had exceeded its\n\nenforcement powers in reauthorizing Section 5 (Count I), and that the 2006 amendments to\n\nSection 5 violated equal protection principles (Count II). That is, the Court saw Count I as\n\nidentical to the facial challenge raised in Shelby County and Northwest Austin, whereas Count II\n\nraised a facial challenge to the amendments under a novel equal protection theory. The D.C.\n\nCircuit's decision indicates that the court of appeals understood plaintiffs' claims the same way.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit summarized plaintiffs' claims as follows: \"Count one of plaintiffs' complaint\n\n\n                                                14\n\fcontends that section 5, as reauthorized in 2006, exceeds Congress’s Fourteenth and Fifteenth\n\nAmendment enforcement powers. Count two contends that amendments made to section 5 in\n\n2006 erect a facially unconstitutional racial-preference scheme.\" LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 780.3\n\nThe D.C. Circuit's discussion of redressability further suggests that it read Count I as a challenge\n\nto all of Section 5 and Count II as a challenge to the amendments. In evaluating whether\n\nplaintiffs had standing to bring Count II, the D.C. Circuit observed that it was unclear \"what\n\nwould happen to the Kinston referendum and the Attorney General's decision to refuse\n\npreclearance\" if plaintiffs succeeded in having the amendments -- but not the general\n\npreclearance regime -- declared unconstitutional. Id. at 794. By contrast, the D.C. Circuit\n\napparently assumed that all of Section 5 would be struck down if plaintiffs succeeded on their\n\nCount I challenge. Compare id. at 791 with id. at 794-95.\n\n       After the remand, however, plaintiffs emphasized that their Count I claim actually had\n\ntwo subparts. See Mot. Hr'g Tr. [Docket Entry 66] 5:7-20, Oct. 26, 2011. The first part --\n\nwhich, for the moment, the Court will refer to as Count I-A -- claims that the reauthorization of\n\nSection 5's preclearance regime exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under the Fourteenth\n\nand Fifteenth Amendments. Compl. ¶¶ 33-34. Count I-A is therefore similar to the claim raised\n\nin Northwest Austin and Shelby County. But a second part, or Count I-B, claims that the\n\nenactment of the 2006 amendments exceeded Congress's enforcement authority even if the\n\ngeneral preclearance regime is constitutional. Compl. ¶ 34. This claim was not raised in either\n\n       3\n           See also id. at 783 (\"Count one alleges that in reauthorizing Section 5, Congress\nexceeded its power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments because the statute 'is\nnot a rational, congruent, or proportional means to enforce [those Amendments']\nnondiscrimination requirements.' Count two contends that as a result of the amendments\nCongress made to section 5 in 2006, the section 'violates the nondiscrimination requirements of\nthe Fifth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.'\" (quoting Compl. ¶¶ 34, 36)).\n\n                                                 15\n\fNorthwest Austin or Shelby County, and was not identified by either this Court or the D.C.\n\nCircuit in the prior decisions in this case. Finally, Count II claims that the 2006 amendments to\n\nSection 5 violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment, the federal government's equivalent of the Equal Protection Clause. Compl. ¶¶ 36-\n\n37.\n\n       The Court has reviewed plaintiffs' complaint, summary judgment motion, and opposition\n\nto the government's summary judgment motion. [Docket Entries 1, 23, 59]. The Court concludes\n\nthat plaintiffs have in fact raised their two-part claim in Count I throughout this litigation\n\n(although they have not always been particularly clear about the nature of the claim), despite the\n\nfact that this Court and the D.C. Circuit did not focus on Count I-B. The existence of Count I-B,\n\nhowever, leaves this Court in an odd position in two ways.\n\n       First, this Court, along with the three-judge court that decided Northwest Austin, has\n\nalready spent hundreds of pages opining that the reauthorization of the amended Section 5 was\n\nwithin Congress's enforcement powers. Although neither the Northwest Austin opinion nor the\n\nShelby County opinion focused on the amendments to Section 5, both of those opinions\n\nimplicitly found that the amendments -- an integral part of Section 5 as enacted in 2006 --\n\nrepresented a congruent and proportional, or rational, response to the problem of discrimination\n\nin voting. This Court will not revisit its conclusion in Shelby County that long-standing, state-\n\nsponsored, intentional discrimination in voting justified the reauthorization of Section 5's general\n\npreclearance procedure. Count I-A is therefore denied for the same reasons given in Shelby\n\nCounty. But the Court will not rely on its past implicit finding that the 2006 amendments\n\nrepresent a congruent and proportional response to the problem of voting discrimination. This\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fCourt therefore must decide whether specific evidence in the record before Congress justified the\n\nenactment of the 2006 amendments.\n\n       The second odd effect of this revised understanding of plaintiffs' claims is that the Court\n\nmust reconsider the issue of Count I standing. Count I-B raises distinct standing issues from\n\nCount I-A; indeed, for standing purposes, Count I-B is more like Count II than Count I-A.\n\nAlthough the D.C. Circuit's opinion directed this Court to address the merits of Count I, the D.C.\n\nCircuit apparently did not envision a Count I decision addressing the constitutionality of only the\n\namendments. And finding only the amendments unconstitutional under Count I would raise\n\nquite different standing issues from finding all of Section 5 unconstitutional, as the D.C. Circuit\n\npointed out in its discussion of Count II. See LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 794-95. Hence, although\n\nthe D.C. Circuit's mandate directs this Court to consider the merits of Count I, the opinion as a\n\nwhole leads this Court to believe that it must first address whether plaintiffs have standing on the\n\naspect of their Count I claim that challenges only the amendments.\n\n       This opinion will therefore proceed as follows. The Court will begin by discussing\n\nwhether plaintiffs have standing to bring Count I-B, their claim that the enactment of the\n\namendments to Section 5 in 2006 exceeded Congress's enforcement powers. The Court will also\n\nconsider whether Count I-B is unripe or moot. The Court will then address the merits of Count\n\nI-B, determining whether the amendments are proper enforcement legislation under the three-\n\npart test laid out in City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520 (1997). Finally, the Court will\n\nturn to Count II, plaintiffs' claim that the amendments violate the equal protection principles of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. The Court will first consider whether plaintiffs have standing to bring the\n\nclaim, then whether the claim succeeds on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f                                            II.

In order for an injury to be \"concrete and\n\nparticularized,\" it must \"affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,\" so a plaintiff must\n\ndo more than raise \"a generally available grievance about government -- claiming only harm to\n\nhis and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws.\" Id. at 561 n.1,\n\n573.\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       The injury, causation, and redressability requirements will be discussed in turn.\n\nFollowing the lead of the court of appeals, this Court will primarily address whether candidate\n\nJohn Nix has standing to bring this claim. LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 792.\n\n       1. Injury\n\n       The D.C. Circuit found that Nix was injured by the operation of Section 5's general\n\npreclearance procedure -- and the resultant suspension of the nonpartisan-election referendum --\n\nin two ways. First, in a system of nonpartisan elections, Nix \"could get his name on the general-\n\nelection ballot more cheaply and easily.\" LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 783. Under Kinston's current\n\nregime, he must either win a partisan primary or collect signatures from 4% of qualified voters to\n\nbe placed on the ballot; under a nonpartisan regime, he would only need to file a candidacy\n\nnotice and pay a filing fee. Id. at 783-84. Second, Nix's chances of winning the election would\n\n\"substantially improve\" if the referendum were precleared and nonpartisan elections went into\n\neffect, because \"Democratic candidates would lose the benefit of party-line straight-ticket voting\n\nand other strategic advantages stemming from their overwhelming registered-voter advantage.\"\n\nId. at 784 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the D.C. Circuit explained, Nix\n\nhas a legally protected interest in such competitive advantages because the nonpartisan election\n\nregime would have been enacted in Kinston but for Section 5, \"which he claims is\n\nunconstitutional and thus void.\" Id. at 786.\n\n       The Court finds that Nix's injury is identical whether the challenge is to the amendments\n\nor to the preclearance procedure in general. In either case, Nix alleges that the suspension of the\n\nreferendum denied him competitive advantages to which he had a legally protected right. The\n\nquestions of causation and redressability are more complex in a challenge to only the\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\famendments, but the question of injury is not.\n\n       2. Causation\n\n       The causation question is more difficult. In plaintiffs' general challenge to Section 5, it\n\nwas clear that the operation of the preclearance regime had caused the suspension of the\n\nreferendum, and hence had caused Nix's injury. In the challenge to the amendments, however,\n\ndefendant makes several arguments as to why the amendments did not cause the suspension of\n\nthe referendum, and hence did not cause Nix's competitive injuries.\n\n       Defendant argues first that the Department of Justice did not rely at all on subsection (c)\n\n-- the subsection that provides that \"[t]he term 'purpose' in subsections (a) and (b) of this section\n\nshall include any discriminatory purpose\" -- in refusing to preclear the referendum. Def.'s Opp.\n\nat 24. The Attorney General's objection letter, which focuses entirely on retrogressive effect and\n\nnever mentions discriminatory purpose, supports defendant's arguments. See Def.'s Opp.,\n\nStatement of Facts, Ex. 2 (objection letter). There is no indication in the record that the\n\nDepartment of Justice has ever claimed that a racially discriminatory purpose motivated the\n\nreferendum; indeed, the objection letter concedes that \"the motivating factor for this change may\n\nbe partisan.\" Id. Nor have plaintiffs offered any reason to believe that the Attorney General\n\nrelied on subsection (c) in denying preclearance to the referendum. Accordingly, the Court\n\nagrees with the government that subsection (c) did not cause plaintiffs' injuries, and plaintiffs\n\ntherefore do not have standing to challenge that provision.\n\n       Subsections (b) and (d), however, govern the \"effects\" prong of Section 5, and the\n\nAttorney General denied preclearance because of the referendum's retrogressive effects. See\n\nDef.'s Opp., Statement of Facts, Ex. 2 (objection letter). The government nonetheless contends\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fthat subsections (b) and (d) did not cause plaintiffs' injuries because their application is limited to\n\nthe districting context. Def.'s Opp. at 24-25. Based on the text of the statute, the Court\n\ndisagrees. Subsection (b) provides that: \"Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or\n\nstandard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose of or will have the\n\neffect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or color . .\n\n. to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the\n\nmeaning of subsection (a) of this section.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b). Subsection (d) explains that\n\n\"[t]he purpose of subsection (b) of this section is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect\n\ntheir preferred candidates of choice.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(d). Hence, by their terms, both\n\nsubsections apply to \"[a]ny voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or\n\nprocedure with respect to voting,\" and nothing in the text limits their application to districting.\n\n        The fact that subsections (b) and (d) were meant to overrule Ashcroft, a case about a\n\ndistricting plan, does not mean that their application is limited to districting. Indeed, although\n\nthe specific considerations outlined in Ashcroft apply most naturally in the districting context, its\n\nbroader holding -- that a totality of the circumstances test rather than a singular focus on\n\nminorities' ability to elect governs preclearance of voting changes -- could be and was applied to\n\nother types of voting procedure changes, including one quite similar to the referendum at issue\n\nhere. In 2004, the Charleston County Legislative Delegation to the South Carolina General\n\nAssembly attempted to change the nonpartisan elections for the Board of Trustees of the\n\nCharleston County School District to partisan elections. See Letter from R. Alexander Acosta,\n\nAssistant Attorney General, to C. Havird Jones, Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General (Feb. 26,\n\n2004). The Attorney General denied preclearance, finding that the change would diminish\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fminorities' ability to elect their candidates of choice. Id. at 2. In doing so, he specifically noted\n\nthat he was applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test under Ashcroft, and he considered,\n\namong other things, whether minority-preferred elected officials supported the change. Id. at 1-\n\n2. Hence, Ashcroft’s broad holding did apply to changes like those at issue here, and the\n\namendments partially overruling it do as well. Indeed, a comparison of the objection letter in\n\nthis case and the objection letter in the Charleston County School District case strongly suggests\n\nthat the Attorney General applied a different standard here than he did there. Compare id. with\n\nDef.'s Opp., Statement of Facts, Ex. 2 (objection letter).\n\n       This does not end the causation inquiry, however, because the question remains whether\n\nthe Attorney General would have come to the same ultimate conclusion under the\n\nAshcroft standard. If so, the amendments did not cause plaintiffs' injury. Neither party has made\n\nany serious effort to answer or analyze that question. Under the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nFederal Election Commission v.

In Akins, plaintiffs challenged the Federal Election\n\nCommission's (\"FEC\") determination that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\n\n(\"AIPAC\") did not have to follow certain registration and disclosure rules under the Federal\n\nElection Campaign Act (\"FECA\") because AIPAC's \"major purpose\" was not nominating or\n\nelecting political candidates. Id. at 14-18. Plaintiffs sued the FEC, arguing that the \"major\n\npurpose\" test misinterpreted FECA. The Supreme Court agreed that plaintiffs' inability to obtain\n\ninformation that would otherwise have been disclosed was a concrete, particularized injury. Id.\n\nat 20-21. The FEC argued, however, that plaintiffs did not have standing because FEC's alleged\n\nmisinterpretation of FECA might not have caused their injury, given that the FEC could have --\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fand, under the evidence in the record, likely would have -- exercised its discretion to exempt\n\nAIPAC from the FECA's requirements. See id. at 25. The Supreme Court nonetheless held that\n\nplaintiffs had standing. It explained:\n\n        [W]e cannot know that the FEC would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion\n        in this way. Agencies often have discretion about whether or not to take a\n        particular action. Yet those adversely affected by a discretionary agency decision\n        generally have standing to complain that the agency based its decision upon an\n        improper legal ground. If a reviewing court agrees that the agency misinterpreted\n        the law, it will set aside the agency's action and remand the case -- even though\n        the agency (like a new jury after a mistrial) might later, in the exercise of its\n        lawful discretion, reach the same result for a different reason. Thus respondents'\n        \"injury in fact\" is \"fairly traceable\" to the FEC's decision not to issue its\n        complaint, even though the FEC might reach the same result exercising its\n        discretionary powers lawfully.\n\nId. at 25 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Here, too, plaintiffs claim that the Attorney General employed the wrong legal standard -\n\n- namely, the allegedly unconstitutional preclearance standard in subsections (b) and (d) rather\n\nthan the test laid out in Ashcroft. The fact that the Attorney General could have reached the\n\nsame result under the correct standard, as the FEC could have \"reach[ed] the same result\n\nexercising its discretionary powers lawfully,\" does not negate causation under Akins. This case\n\nis not exactly like Akins – among other things, the Attorney General's \"discretion\" to make\n\npreclearance decisions is not as broad as the FEC's authority was under FECA – but the Court\n\nsees no reason that those differences dictate a different result here. Accordingly, under Akins,\n\nthe Court holds that plaintiffs have established that subsections (b) and (d) caused their injury.\n\n        3. Redressability\n\n        Plaintiffs offer various arguments for why their injury -- the postponement of the\n\nreferendum -- will be redressed if this Court finds the 2006 amendments unconstitutional. Their\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fprimary argument is that subsections (b), (c), and (d) cannot be severed from subsection (a),\n\nwhich contains the core preclearance provision.

Opp.\") [Docket Entry 59] at 39-44. Hence, according to plaintiffs' theory,\n\nfinding that the amendments are unconstitutional would mean that all of Section 5 must be struck\n\nas unconstitutional. Id. And, as the D.C. Circuit explained, striking Section 5 as\n\nunconstitutional would revive the referendum. This is so because if \"Section 5 is\n\nunconstitutional, the Attorney General's actions pursuant to that unconstitutional statute would\n\nbe void.\" LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 791.\n\n       Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, the Court agrees with the government that the\n\namendments are severable from subsection (a)'s general preclearance provision. When possible,\n\ncourts sever unconstitutional portions of a statute rather than striking the whole statute. Free\n\nEnter. Fund v. Pub. Co.

Accordingly, it was Congress's considered judgment that Section 5 without\n\nthe Bossier II and Ashcroft \"fixes\" was better than no Section 5 at all. Plaintiffs argue that the\n\nseverability clause has been part of the Voting Rights Act since 1965, and thus cannot speak to\n\nthe 2006 Congress's intent. But this Court must presume that Congress was aware of the clause\n\nwhen it reauthorized and amended Section 5, and that it affirmatively intended the severability\n\nclause to apply to the amendments. See Koog v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714975\"><a href=\"/opinion/714975/jr-koog-sheriff-val-verde-county-texas-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463 n.12 (5th Cir.\n\n1996); see also Alaska Airlines, Inc. v.

Moreover, nothing in the\n\nlegislative history suggests a reason to question this presumption. Certainly, several members of\n\nCongress made clear that they thought the Bossier II and Ashcroft fixes were important, but\n\nthere was no serious discussion of whether failing to reauthorize Section 5 at all was preferable\n\nto reauthorizing Section 5 as construed by those cases. See Leavitt v. Jane L., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118046\"><a href=\"/opinion/118046/leavitt-v-jane-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n143-144 (1996) (statements indicating that Congress preferred complete statute do not\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fundermine case for severability because \"[t]his mode of analysis, if carried out in every case,\n\nwould operate to defeat every claim of severability\").\n\n       The Court therefore concludes that each of the amendments is severable from subsection\n\n(a), the general preclearance procedure. Hence, the Court rejects plaintiffs' primary\n\nredressability argument. The question then is whether there is any other reason that finding\n\nsubsections (b) and (d) unconstitutional would redress plaintiffs' injury. The Court finds that\n\nthere is such a reason.\n\n       First, the D.C. Circuit's opinion makes clear that the Attorney General's objection would\n\nbe nullified if the amendments were struck down as unconstitutional. The D.C. Circuit explained\n\nthat if all of Section 5 is unconstitutional, the Attorney General's actions pursuant to it would be\n\nvoid. LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 791. Similarly, if the amendments are unconstitutional, the\n\nAttorney General's actions pursuant to them would be void. Although subsection (a) contains\n\nthe actual preclearance procedure, the Attorney General's actions were indeed made \"pursuant\n\nto\" subsections (b) and (d) in addition to subsection (a), because subsections (b) and (d) now\n\ndefine the key terms in subsection (a).\n\n       The question then is what would happen to the Kinston referendum if the Attorney\n\nGeneral's original objection were nullified, but Section 5's general preclearance procedure\n\nremained in place. Because the D.C. Circuit considered only the situation where Section 5 was\n\nstruck down in its entirety, it did not provide guidance on this issue. Moreover, because this is a\n\nnovel situation, neither party has identified any case on point. As a matter of logic, however, it\n\nwould seem that the referendum would have to be precleared under the pre-2006 version of\n\nSection 5 before it could go into effect. Cf. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 490 (remanding to district\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fcourt to reconsider whether districting plan could be precleared in light of standard laid out by\n\nSupreme Court). Any other course of action would lead to the anomalous result that the Kinston\n\nreferendum -- unlike every other election law -- could go into effect without ever being\n\nprecleared. Moreover, contrary to the government's view, the Court does not believe that\n\nKinston would be able to make a discretionary decision not to seek such reconsideration of the\n\nreferendum. See United States' Resp. to Plfs.' Br. Regarding Suggestion of Mootness at 3-4\n\n[Docket Entry 69]. Preclearance of the Kinston referendum under the pre-2006 version of\n\nSection 5 would not be \"reconsideration\" as that term is usually used in this context. Rather, it\n\nwould be a routine action to seek preclearance of an election change that had not yet been\n\nthrough the (proper) process.\n\n       Assuming that the referendum would have to be precleared under the pre-2006 standard,\n\nthe final question is whether it would, in fact, be precleared under that standard. If it is clear that\n\nthe referendum would not be precleared under any standard, plaintiffs' claims are not redressable\n\nand they have no standing to challenge the 2006 amendments. As with the causation prong,\n\nneither party has analyzed this issue in any detail. But, again as with the causation prong, the\n\nCourt finds this question governed by Akins. After explaining that causation was not defeated\n\nsimply because an agency that \"based its decision upon an improper legal ground\" could reach\n\nthe same decision on a proper legal ground, the Supreme Court disposed of the \"redressability\"\n\nprong in a single sentence: \"For similar reasons, the courts in this case can redress respondents'\n\ninjury in fact.\" 524 U.S. at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as in Akins, the injury is\n\nredressable because the Attorney General will have to reconsider preclearance of the referendum\n\nunder the Ashcroft standard if plaintiffs succeed, even though the Attorney General \"might later,\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fin the exercise of [his] lawful discretion, reach the same result for a different reason.\" Id.; see\n\nalso Townes v.

Supp. 2d at 168-73, 180-82, the Court concludes that referendum proponents do not have\n\nstanding; that the voters' allegation that their associational rights are burdened is too generalized\n\nto support standing; and that the voters are not precluded from supporting their candidates of\n\nchoice. KCNV, however, does have standing to challenge subsections (b) and (d), because it has\n\nestablished that one of its \"members would otherwise have standing to sue in [his] own right\"\n\nand \"the interests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose.\" Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n\nv.

Effect in this case\n\n       Finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing as to subsection (c), of course, means that\n\n\n\n       4\n         Plaintiffs might also have standing to challenge the amendments as part of their\nchallenge to the general preclearance regime (Count I-A), for which they have standing.\nLaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 792. That is, plaintiffs could argue that the enactment of the general\npreclearance regime exceeds Congress's enforcement power, and that the amendments are simply\nan aspect of Congress's overreach in reauthorizing Section 5. This formulation of their argument\nis academic as to subsections (b) and (d), but could change the outcome in subsection (c). As the\nCourt reads plaintiffs' papers, however, their argument is that even if the general preclearance\nmechanism is constitutional, the substantive standard laid out in subsections (b) through (d) is\nunconstitutional. See generally Plfs.' Opp. (devoting separate sections to Count I-A, Count I-B,\nand Count II); Plfs.' Notice of Filing, Ex. 1, at 2 [Docket Entry 36] (letter to Court describing\nclaims). Because plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality of the amendments separately\nfrom the entire preclearance standard, they must establish standing for that challenge. See U.S.\nEcology, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (D.C.

See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 559-60. However, as the D.C. Circuit explained, time is of the\n\nessence in this case, and plaintiffs have already been through one appeal and remand. LaRoque\n\nII, 650 F.3d at 795. Solely in order to obviate any possible need for another remand, and in the\n\nunusual circumstances of this case, this Court will explain how it would rule on the merits of\n\nsubsection (c) if plaintiffs could establish standing on that claim. Should the D.C. Circuit\n\ndisagree with this Court's conclusion on standing, it will then be able to address the merits\n\nimmediately.\n\n                                           B. Ripeness\n\n       The Court declines the government's invitation to find that plaintiffs' challenge is not ripe\n\nfor review. This case is not like Texas v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118190\"><a href=\"/opinion/118190/texas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), upon which the\n\ngovernment relies. There, the state of Texas made certain changes to its educational system that\n\nhad the potential to affect voting. Id. at 298-99. The Department of Justice found that the\n\nspecific changes at issue did not affect voting and did not require preclearance, but that \"under\n\ncertain foreseeable circumstances their implementation may\" require preclearance. Id. at 299.\n\nTexas sought a declaratory judgment that Section 5 did not apply. Id. The Supreme Court found\n\nthat Texas's claim was not ripe because a long sequence of events had to occur before the\n\npreclearance issue could arise, and it might never arise. Id. at 300. Moreover, Texas had asked\n\nthe Court to hold that it was impossible for the educational changes to affect voting, and the\n\nCourt explained that \"[w]e do not have sufficient confidence in our powers of imagination to\n\naffirm such a negative.\" Id. at 301. Moreover, because Texas was currently implementing the\n\neducational changes without any impediment, the Court found that Texas would suffer no\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fhardship by deferring review until it was clear that review would be necessary. Id. at 301-02.\n\n       Here, in contrast, the Attorney General has already objected to the referendum and\n\nthereby harmed Nix's interests. This is not a case about events that might never happen.\n\nMoreover, although the parties admittedly disagree about how the statute will be applied, the\n\nCourt finds that there is sufficient information to construe the statute and make a judgment as to\n\nits facial validly. That other parties could later bring as-applied claims does not mean this facial\n\nchallenge is not ripe.\n\n                                            C. Mootness\n\n       Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that Nix planned to run for Kinston city council in\n\nNovember 2011. That election occurred during the course of this litigation. Nix lost, coming in\n\nfourth out of six candidates running for three seats. Plfs.' Br. Regarding Suggestion of Mootness\n\nat 1 [Docket Entry 67]. Plaintiffs have, however, submitted a copy of Nix's campaign website, in\n\nwhich he promises to run again in the next election in November 2013. Id., Ex. C. Plaintiffs and\n\nthe government agree that the case is therefore not moot. Because election litigation frequently\n\noutlasts election cycles, Nix's injury is of the type that is \"capable of repetition, yet evading\n\nreview.\" LaRouche v. Fowler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 978-79 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also LaRoque II, 650\n\nF.3d at 788. Nix is likely -- indeed, nearly certain -- to suffer the same injury in his 2013 run for\n\nKinston city council. See LaRouche, 152 F.3d at 978-79. Accordingly, the Court finds that this\n\naction is not moot.\n\n                                             D. Merits\n\n       1.    Standard of Review\n\n       The parties dispute whether the claim that Congress exceeded its enforcement power in\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fenacting the amended Section 5 should be reviewed under the rationality standard set forth in\n\nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. at 324, or under the more rigorous test laid out in City of Boerne v.

For the reasons given there, the Court will review plaintiffs' claims\n\nunder Boerne's \"congruence and proportionality\" test.\n\n       2.   The Scope of the Constitutional Right At Issue\n\n       In determining whether the 2006 amendments are within Congress's enforcement power,\n\nthe first step under Boerne is \"to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional\n\nright at issue.\" See Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365 (2001); see\n\nalso Tennessee v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (2004). Where a statute is designed to protect a\n\nfundamental right or to prevent discrimination based on a suspect classification, it is \"easier for\n\nCongress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations,\" as required at the second step of\n\nthe Boerne analysis. See Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127926\"><a href=\"/opinion/127926/nevada-department-of-human-resources-v-hibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (2003). In\n\nother words, Congress is more likely to be able to identify unconstitutional state action justifying\n\nremedial, prophylactic enforcement legislation when it seeks to protect against discrimination\n\nbased on a classification like gender, \"which triggers heightened scrutiny,\" see Hibbs, 538 U.S.\n\nat 736, than when it seeks to protect against discrimination based on a trait such as disability,\n\nwhich \"incurs only the minimum 'rational-basis' review,\" see Garrett, 531 U.S. at 366. This is\n\nbecause \"the heightened level of constitutional scrutiny\" that accompanies a suspect\n\nclassification or a fundamental right means that \"the historical problems\" identified by Congress\n\nwith respect to that class or right are more likely to amount to constitutional violations, and a\n\nhistory of constitutional violations is a necessary predicate for the enactment of remedial\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fenforcement legislation under the Reconstruction Amendments. See Mark A. Posner, Time is\n\nStill On its Side: Why Congressional Reauthorization of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act\n\nRepresents a Congruent and Proportional Response to Our Nation's History of Discrimination in\n\nVoting, 10 N.Y.U. J. LEGIS. & PUB. POL'Y 51, 87 (2006). Hence, \"the Court gives Congress\n\nsignificant leeway to craft broad remedial prohibitions when fundamental rights or protected\n\nclasses are at stake.\" Nw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 270.\n\n       The amendments to Section 5 protect two fundamental rights. First, they seek to protect\n\nthe right to vote -- a \"fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights,\" Yick\n\nWo v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (1886). Second, they protect against discrimination based on\n\nrace, \"the classification of which we have been the most suspect,\" see M.L.B. v.

Because Section 5 protects two of the most crucial\n\nconstitutional rights, Congress's enforcement powers are at its peak when it legislates to ensure\n\nthat voting is free from racial discrimination. See Nathaniel Persily, The Promise and Pitfalls of\n\nthe New Voting Rights Act, 117 YALE L.J. 174, 176 (2007) (hereinafter Persily, Promise and\n\nPitfalls) (explaining that Congress \"acted at the apex of its power to enforce the guarantees of the\n\npost-Civil War Amendments\" when it enacted the Voting Rights Act). Just as in Hibbs and\n\nLane, then, it is \"easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations\"\n\njustifying the need for Section 5 than when Congress seeks to enforce rights subject to lesser\n\nlevels of constitutional review, since \"racial classifications and restrictions on the right to vote -\n\nlike gender discrimination (Hibbs) and access to the courts (Lane) - are 'presumptively invalid.'\"\n\nNw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 270 (quoting Hibbs, 538 U.S. at 736).\n\n       3. Evidence of Unconstitutional Discrimination in the Legislative Record and the\n        Congruence and Proportionality of Section 5\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f       Given this definition of \"the constitutional right at issue,\" Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365, the\n\nnext question is whether Congress identified \"a history and pattern\" of unconstitutional, state-\n\nsponsored voting discrimination that justified the 2006 amendments to Section 5. Id. at 368. If\n\nthe Court finds that Congress has identified such a pattern, it must then consider whether the\n\nchallenged law is congruent and proportional to the identified violations. Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n\n520, 530-32. In answering these second and third Boerne inquiries, the Court will consider\n\nsubsection (c) and subsections (b) and (d) separately. Before doing so, however, one general\n\nargument plaintiffs press throughout their briefs must be addressed.\n\n               1. The expansion of the preclearance standard\n\n       Plaintiffs vehemently argue that the amendments cannot be a congruent and proportional\n\nresponse to discrimination in voting, regardless of the evidence Congress amassed during the\n\n2006 reauthorization, because \"any 2006 expansion of the 1965 preclearance standard would be\n\nunconstitutional given the dramatic improvements in the covered jurisdictions.\" Plfs.' Opp. at\n\n33. Under their argument, there is a bright-line rule that any expansion of Section 5 is now per\n\nse unconstitutional under Boerne.\n\n       The Court rejects this simplistic argument for several reasons. First, even if the\n\namendments are an expansion of Section 5's preclearance standard, that does not ipso facto make\n\nthem unconstitutional. Congress has previously expanded substantive provisions of the Voting\n\nRights Act, even in the face of unquestionably improved voting conditions, without thereby\n\nrendering the VRA unconstitutional. In 1982, for instance, Congress significantly expanded the\n\nVRA by providing that acts related to voting that were discriminatory in effect, as well as those\n\nthat were discriminatory in purpose, violated Section 2 of the Act. Presumably employing\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fKatzenbach's rationality review, the Supreme Court summarily affirmed that the post-1982\n\nSection 2 was constitutional. Miss. Republican Exec. Comm. v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111325\"><a href=\"/opinion/111325/mississippi-republican-executive-committee-v-owen-h-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1003\n\n(1984).\n\n          Plaintiffs' bright-line argument does not make sense even as a theoretical matter.\n\nCongress has amassed substantial evidence of discrimination in voting; it therefore has a range\n\nof options for remedial legislation that would be congruent and proportional to the problem. In\n\nevaluating the 2006 reauthorization, the question before this Court is whether the legislative\n\nresponse Congress chose is within that range, not where it falls in the range relative to past\n\nlegislation. See Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530-32. So long as current needs justify the current\n\nlegislation, see Nw. Austin II, 129 S. Ct. at 2512, it does not matter whether Congress is\n\nlegislating more or less assertively than it has in the past. This is particularly true because\n\nSection 5 now responds primarily to \"second generation\" voting problems, rather than to the\n\n\"first generation\" problem of outright denials of the vote. House Hearing, 109th Cong. 1134\n\n(Oct. 18, 2005) (Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, eds., Quiet Revolution in the South:\n\nThe Impact of the Voting Rights Act 1965-1990 14 (Princeton University Press 1994)).\n\nCongress could reasonably decide that a different preclearance standard is necessary to respond\n\nto a different set of problems, and that decision would be acceptable so long as the remedy is\n\ncongruent and proportional to the problem. Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530-32.\n\n          Theoretical arguments aside, it is not at all clear that the 2006 amendments actually\n\nrepresent an expansion to Section 5's preclearance standard. As this Court explained in the\n\nShelby County decision, \"[i]n Bossier II . . . the Supreme Court -- for the first time -- held that\n\nthe 'purpose' prong of Section 5 only prohibits electoral changes that are enacted with a\n\n\n\n                                                  34\n\fdiscriminatory and retrogressive purpose.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10. Congress added\n\nsubsection (c) to Section 5 in order to \"restore[] the pre-Bossier II 'purpose' standard.\" Id. at\n\n*11. Similarly, \"the Supreme Court's decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130158\"><a href=\"/opinion/130158/georgia-v-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003) . . .\n\nhad altered the preexisting standard for determining whether a voting change had a prohibited\n\nretrogressive effect under Section 5's 'effects' prong.\" Id. Congress therefore added subsections\n\n(b) and (d) \"in an attempt to restore the simpler, 'ability to elect' analysis articulated in\" prior\n\ncaselaw. Id. This Court's understanding of the amendments as restorative was echoed by many\n\nwitnesses during the 2005 and 2006 hearings. See, e.g., Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 182 (May\n\n9, 2006) (responses of Theodore M. Shaw to questions of Sens. Specter, Cornyn, Leahy,\n\nKennedy, and Schumer); Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 149 (May 9, 2006) (responses of Laughlin\n\nMcDonald to questions of Sens. Specter, Kennedy, Schumer and Cornyn); see also House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 59 (Nov. 1, 2005) (statement of Rep. John Conyers). While there was a\n\nless universal consensus that the Ashcroft \"fix\" was a simple return to the status quo ante than\n\nthere was for the Bossier II \"fix,\" see infra at 63-64, there was also no consensus that the\n\nAshcroft \"fix\" represented an expansion -- rather than a simple change -- to the preclearance\n\nstandard. Id.\n\n        In response to this record evidence, plaintiffs argue that \"'[a] judicial construction of a\n\nstatute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision\n\nof the case giving rise to that construction.'\" Plfs.' Opp. at 33 (quoting Rivers v. Roadway\n\nExpress, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117842\"><a href=\"/opinion/117842/rivers-v-roadway-express-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312-13 (1994)). Plaintiffs contend that the Supreme Court's\n\ndecisions in Bossier II and Ashcroft necessarily establish what section 5 always meant, and that\n\nit is therefore impossible to read the 2006 amendments as anything other than an expansion to\n\n\n\n                                                   35\n\fSection 5's preclearance standard.\n\n       The general rule is, of course, that \"statutes operate only prospectively, while judicial\n\ndecisions operate retrospectively.\" United States v. Sec. Indus. Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110811\"><a href=\"/opinion/110811/united-states-v-security-industrial-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (1982).\n\nHence, a judicial decision establishes what a statute meant as well as what it means. But in this\n\ncontext, the Court does not believe that this general rule determines the constitutionality of the\n\n2006 amendments to Section 5. Rivers explained that Congress could legislatively overrule a\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court if Congress believed the decision to be in error. 511 U.S. at 313.\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court explained, Congress \"may even, within broad constitutional bounds,\n\nmake such a change retroactive and thereby undo what it perceives to be the undesirable past\n\nconsequences of a misinterpretation of its work product.\" Id. That is, Congress has the power to\n\nlegislatively overrule the Supreme Court's determination of what the statute meant as well as the\n\nCourt's determination of what the statute means.\n\n       Here, Congress made quite clear that it disagreed with the Supreme Court's determination\n\nof what Section 5 meant, although it chose not to throw state and local election systems into\n\nchaos by making the amendments apply retroactively. In the findings accompanying the\n\nreauthorized Section 5, Congress found that \"[t]he effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965 has been significantly weakened by the United States Supreme Court in Reno v. Bossier\n\nParish II and Georgia v. Ashcroft, which have misconstrued Congress' original intent in enacting\n\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 and narrowed the protections accorded by section 5 of such act.\"\n\nPub. L. 109-246, § 2(b)(6), 120 Stat. at 578; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 2. The\n\namendments in subsections (b) through (d) were enacted \"to (1) restore the original purpose to\n\nSection 5 with respect to intentionally discriminatory voting changes; and (2) clarify the types of\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fconduct that Section 5 was intended to prevent.\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 65. The\n\nauthoritative determination of whether those amendments are constitutional is, of course,\n\nreserved to the courts. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). But as a\n\nmatter of statutory construction, Congress made clear that the amendments represented a\n\nrestoration of the proper Section 5 standard, not an expansion.\n\n       Moreover, this Court would be hesitant to invalidate the amendments in the context of\n\nthe Boerne analysis solely on the basis of the rule cited in Rivers. Under Boerne, the Court not\n\nonly reviews the law Congress has enacted and whether Congress had rational reasons for doing\n\nso, but also undertakes an in-depth analysis of how Congress arrived at its legislative\n\nconclusions. Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530-32; see also Lane, 541 U.S. at 558-59 (2004) (Scalia, J.,\n\ndissenting) (\"Under [Boerne], the courts . . . must regularly check Congress's homework to make\n\nsure that it has identified sufficient constitutional violations to make its remedy congruent and\n\nproportional.\"). Such oversight of a co-equal branch is a delicate task. See id. at 558. Given\n\nthat virtually everyone who testified before Congress described Bossier II and Ashcroft as a\n\nchange from prior law -- at least as that law had been applied by courts and the Department of\n\nJustice -- this Court is reluctant to play \"gotcha\" with Congress and invalidate the amendments\n\non the ground that they could technically represent an expansion of the statute.\n\n               2. Subsection (c)\n\n       As previously explained, the second step of the Boerne analysis is to determine whether\n\nCongress identified \"a history and pattern\" of unconstitutional, state-sponsored voting\n\ndiscrimination that justified the 2006 amendments to Section 5. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 368.\n\nThe bulk of the opinion in Shelby County -- some seventy pages -- was devoted to reviewing\n\nwhat direct and circumstantial evidence of purposeful discrimination Congress had amassed.\n\n                                                37\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *36-64. The Court will incorporate that discussion by reference rather\n\nthan repeating it here.\n\n       The specific issue raised by plaintiffs' challenge to subsection (c) is whether, given those\n\nfindings, the amendment is a congruent and proportional response to the pattern of identified\n\nunconstitutional behavior. To answer that question, the Court will focus on the evidence\n\nCongress amassed regarding why the amendment was necessary, i.e., why the Bossier II standard\n\ncould not respond to the problem of state-sponsored voting discrimination. Hence, keeping in\n\nmind the findings of purposeful discrimination discussed in Shelby County, the Court will turn\n\nto Congressional record evidence specific to the Bossier II amendment in subsection (c).\n\n       Congress heard the testimony of numerous witnesses on the need to overrule Bossier II.\n\nAs Debo Adegbile of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund explained, \"in a very complex area of\n\nlaw[,] the problem with Bossier Parish II is very understandable to everybody, whether they be a\n\nlawyer or not, a representative or not. The problem is that the Voting Rights Act was clearly\n\nintended to stop discrimination in voting. It was most certainly intended to stop intentional\n\ndiscrimination in voting, and it was a long history of intentional discrimination that gave rise to\n\nthe Voting Rights Act.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 38 (May 4, 2006) (statement of Debo P.\n\nAdegbile). Yet, under Bossier II, voting changes that purposefully discriminated on the basis of\n\nrace had to be precleared. See Bossier II, 528 U.S. at 341 (holding that Section 5 \"does not\n\nprohibit preclearance of a redistricting plan with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive\n\npurpose\"). Drew Days, a law professor and voting rights practitioner, testified that the Bossier II\n\nstandard \"permit[ted] absurd results\" and was \"basically at war with the spirit of Section 5 in that\n\nit places a burden on those that the Act was designed to protect.\" Senate Hearing, 109th Cong.\n\n57 (May 17, 2006) (responses of Drew S. Days III to questions of Sens. Cornyn, Coburn,\n\n                                                 38\n\fKennedy, Leahy, and Schumer).\n\n       Several witnesses explained that forcing minority voters to go to the time and expense of\n\nSection 2 litigation in cases where there appeared to be intentional discrimination was highly\n\nimpractical for two reasons. First, neither the \"small and underfinanced\" voting rights bar nor\n\nthe minority communities were in a position to bear the expense of frequent litigation under\n\nSection 2. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 95 (May 16, 2006) (responses of Pamela S. Karlan to\n\nquestions of Sens. Leahy, Kennedy, Kohl, Cornyn, and Coburn). Second, in the time it took to\n\nlitigate a section 2 case, candidates who benefitted from the intentionally discriminatory voting\n\nprocedures would already be incumbents and would have all the crucial advantages of\n\nincumbency in later elections. See, e.g., House Hearing, 109th Cong. 97 (Mar. 8, 2006)\n\n(statement of Joe Rogers); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 60 (Nov. 9, 2005) (statement of Rep.\n\nTyrone L. Brooks of Georgia General Assembly). Hence, moving a large number of voting\n\nrights issues from Section 5 to Section 2 ran counter to the goal of \"shift[ing] the advantage of\n\ntime and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims.\" Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 328.\n\n       Congress also heard evidence that Bossier II, left uncorrected, would indeed force\n\npreclearance of a large number of questionable practices that could only be remedied by time-\n\nconsuming, burdensome Section 2 litigation. Richard Valelly, a co-author of Peyton McCrary,\n\nChristopher Seaman & Richard Valelly, The End of Preclearance As We Knew It: How the\n\nSupreme Court Transformed Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 11 MICH. J. RACE & L. 275\n\n(2006) (hereinafter \"End of Preclearance\"), testified before the House about the study. House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 877-922 (Oct. 18, 2005) (statement of Richard M. Valelly). According to\n\nthe End of Preclearance study, 43% of all Section 5 objections in the 1990s were based solely on\n\ndiscriminatory intent, while another 31% of objections were based at least in part on\n\n                                                39\n\fdiscriminatory intent. See End of Preclearance 297 tbl. 2. Hence, \"the intent prong was\n\ninvolved in a remarkable 74 percent of all objections in that decade.\" Id. at 298. Purpose-based\n\nobjections were particularly prevalent in the redistricting context, where nearly 90% of the\n\nJustice Department's objections to post-1990 redistricting plans were based at least in part on\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Id. at 298 tbl. 3; see also House Hearing, 109th Cong. 13-16 (Nov. 1,\n\n2005) (Posner prepared statement).\n\n       According to the End of Preclearance study, these numbers changed remarkably after the\n\nSupreme Court decided Bossier II. From the time of the Supreme Court's decision in January\n\n2000 until the end of June 2004, the Department of Justice issued 43 total objections to voting\n\nchanges, compared to 250 objections in the equivalent period during the 1990s. End of\n\nPreclearance 313-14 & n.198. Strikingly, only two of those objections were based solely on\n\nintent; 13 were based on both intent and purpose. Id. Hence, from 1990-2000, 43% of\n\nobjections were based solely on purpose and 74% were based in part on purpose. In the four and\n\na half years after Bossier II, however, 4.7% of objections were based solely on purpose and\n\n30.2% were based in part on purpose. As one of the study authors summarized, the effect of\n\nBossier II was \"sort of like dropping off a cliff.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 879 (Oct. 18,\n\n2005) (Valelly statement).\n\n       There are, of course, at least two readings of this information. One reading is that the\n\nDepartment of Justice had successfully blocked many voting changes that were intended to\n\ndiscriminate against minorities in the 1990s, but that Bossier II prevented it from doing so in the\n\n2000s, thus allowing those changes to go into practice. Alternatively, some of the Supreme\n\nCourt's opinions have made clear that some members of the Court believe that the Department of\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\fJustice inappropriately relied on the purpose prong to force redistricting jurisdictions to draw the\n\nmaximum possible number of majority-minority districts. See Miller v, Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n924-25 (1995); see also Shaw v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911-13 (1996) (\"Shaw II\"). Hence, another\n\nreading of the End of Preclearance data is that the Department of Justice was indeed relying too\n\nheavily on the purpose prong and Bossier II had the salutary effect of forcing it to cease doing\n\nso.\n\n       Congress heard considerable testimony on this question. One witness explained that he\n\nwould address it because \"if the Department badly handled this authority in the past, one could\n\nask whether it is appropriate to again give the Department that authority in the future.\" House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 882 (Oct. 18, 2005) (Posner statement). After analysis of objections\n\ninterposed by the Department in the 1990s, he concluded that the Department of Justice had\n\ngenerally followed the standard laid out in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\n\nDevelopment Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977), in interposing objections based on discriminatory\n\npurpose. Id. at 883; see also House Hearing, 109 Cong. 17-18 (Nov. 1, 2005) (Posner prepared\n\nstatement). Another witness agreed that the Justice Department had properly used the \"objective\n\nand workable standard\" of Arlington Heights in deciding whether to preclear voting changes\n\nunder the purpose prong. Senate Hearing, 109 Cong. 174-75, 182 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw\n\nresponses). This Court agrees with those assessments. Although reasonable people could differ\n\non the correctness of some of the objections interposed by the Department in the 1980s and\n\n1990s, the Court finds that Congress amassed sufficient evidence in 2005 and 2006 to support\n\nthe conclusion that the Justice Department had largely used the purpose prong correctly before\n\nBossier II, and that Bossier II had forced preclearance of many intentionally discriminatory\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fvoting procedures that could only be remedied by time-consuming, expensive Section 2\n\nlitigation. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 66-68.\n\n       Congress also heard testimony about discriminatory voting changes that would have been\n\nprecleared had the Department of Justice followed the Bossier II standards since the inception of\n\nSection 5. The End of Preclearance authors pointed out that under the Bossier II standard,\n\nSection 5 would have been virtually useless when it was \"'needed most,'\" because in some places\n\n\"'historical discrimination had left the number of black voters at close to zero.'\" House Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 149 (Nov. 1, 2005) (draft of End of Preclearance) (quoting Bossier II, 528 U.S. at\n\n374 (Breyer, J., dissenting)); see also Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 94 (May 16, 2006) (Karlan\n\nresponses) (elaborating on the point). As one witness explained, \"[t]he Bossier II rule actually\n\nrewards the most intransigent perpetrators of discrimination, who after decades of exclusion of\n\nminority voters and candidates, may now be able to keep the political process closed on the\n\nground that they have not abandoned their discriminatory ways. In these circumstances, under\n\nthe reasoning of Bossier II, would-be violators are not diminishing political power or access but\n\nmerely maintaining an exclusionary status quo. This scenario may aptly be characterized as\n\nperversely paying dividends for past discrimination.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 43 (May 4,\n\n2006) (Adegbile prepared statement).\n\n       The record also contained evidence of specific discriminatory changes that would have\n\ngone into effect under the Bossier II standard. For instance, several witnesses pointed out that\n\nBossier II would have required preclearance of the infamous proposed 1981 congressional\n\nredistricting in Georgia. As described in Shelby County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *51, Georgia\n\nbegan its congressional redistricting process after the 1980 census showed that the state's ten\n\n\n\n                                                42\n\fexisting districts -- all of which were majority-white with the exception of the Fifth District --\n\nhad become severely malapportioned. Under the leadership of Joe Mack Wilson, Chair of the\n\nHouse Reapportionment Committee, Georgia created a redistricting plan that maintained its nine\n\nmajority-white districts, and split the large, contiguous black population of the Atlanta\n\nmetropolitan area between the Fourth and Fifth Districts, thereby ensuring that blacks would still\n\ncomprise a majority of the Fifth District, but would only constitute 46% of the registered voters\n\nthere. See Busbee v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1791783\"><a href=\"/opinion/1791783/busbee-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Because Georgia's plan\n\nincreased the percentage of blacks in the Fifth District, however, it was not retrogressive, and\n\ntherefore \"technically . . .

In reaching this determination, the court made an express finding that \"Representative\n\nJoe Mack Wilson is a racist.\" Id. at 500. The court cited Wilson's now-infamous statement that\n\nhe did not want to draw \"nigger districts,\" id. at 501, as well as testimony from other Georgia\n\nlegislators, who conceded that they, too, had intentionally sought to \"keep the Fifth District 'as\n\nwhite as possible . . . but just within the limits . . . to satisfy the Voting Rights Act . . . .'\" Id. at\n\n515 (internal citation omitted). As one state legislator explained, \"'the motivation of the House\n\nleadership' in creating the Fifth District . . . was to 'increase [the percentage of the black\n\npopulation] just enough to say they had increased it [and] so that it would look like they had\n\nincreased it, but they knew they had not increased it enough to elect a black.\" Id. (internal\n\ncitation omitted). Another state senator admitted that he had felt obliged to vote for the plan\n\n\n\n                                                     43\n\fbecause he \"'[didn't] want to have to go home and explain why I . . . was the leader in getting a\n\nblack elected to the United States Congress.'\" Id. at 514 (internal citation omitted). These\n\n\"[o]vert racial statements,\" together with Georgia's history of racial discrimination in voting, and\n\nthe absence of any legitimate non-racial reasons for the redistricting plan, convinced the three-\n\njudge court that the plan had been enacted with a discriminatory purpose, and hence had \"'no\n\nlegitimacy at all under our Constitution or under [Section 5].'\" Id. at 517 (quoting City of\n\nRichmond v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109297\"><a href=\"/opinion/109297/richmond-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378-79 (1975)). Representative John Lewis was\n\nultimately elected from the effective majority-minority district preserved by the litigation. See\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 20 (Nov. 1, 2005) (statement of Brenda Wright). Under Bossier II,\n\nhowever, this discriminatory plan could only have been contested through Section 2 litigation.\n\n       Similarly, without the proposed amendment, the Justice Department would have had to\n\npreclear Bladen County, North Carolina's 1987 attempt to change its method of election for its\n\nboard of county commissioners from at-large elections to three double-member and one at-large\n\ndistrict. Although the Justice Department found that the change would not have a retrogressive\n\neffect, it nonetheless denied preclearance to the change based on its inability to conclude \"that\n\nthe proposed election system is free from discriminatory purpose.\" 2 House Hearing, Scope,\n\n109th Cong. 1761 (Oct. 25, 2005) (appendix to statement of Bradley J. Schlozman, Copies of\n\nObjection Letters, by State, from 1980 to October 17, 2006) (hereinafter, \"Schlozman\n\nAppendix\"). According to the Justice Department, the evidence presented by the county\n\ndemonstrated that \"the responsible public officials [had] desired to adopt a plan which would\n\nmaintain white political control to the maximum extent possible and thereby minimize the\n\nopportunity for effective political participation by black citizens.\" Id. at 1762. Indeed, the\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\fJustice Department explained, \"it appears that the board undertook extraordinary measures to\n\nadopt an election plan which minimizes minority voting strength.\" Id.\n\n       Finally, Congress heard direct evidence that some jurisdictions were looking to capitalize\n\non Bossier II and other cases to the disadvantage of minority voters. The testimony of Kent\n\nWillis, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia, provided a particularly\n\nstriking confirmation of this point. See House Hearing, 109th Cong. 894 (Oct. 18, 2005)\n\n(statement of Kent Willis). Willis explained that he had attended a 2002 redistricting meeting in\n\nFredricksburg, Virginia, where he lived. Id. The city had \"long had one African-American\n\nmajority district in its system,\" and African-Americans had historically been elected from that\n\ndistrict. Id. Willis testified that the discussion at the 2002 meeting \"was entirely about how do\n\nwe eliminate this district. And the instruction[] to the city attorney was, look at the recent\n\nSupreme Court case, you know, look at the cases that are taking place in the mid-'90s and early\n\n2000, and tell us if there is a way we can eliminate the African-American majority district.\" Id.\n\n       To summarize, Congress collected extensive evidence of purposefully discriminatory\n\nvoting changes that could or clearly would go into effect in the absence of the amendment in\n\nsubsection (c). It also heard testimony that leaving Bossier II intact would shift a great deal of\n\nvoting rights litigation from Section 5 to Section 2, and that such a shift would be a practical\n\ndisaster for minority voting rights. To correct these several problems, Congress amended section\n\n5 to specify that \"[t]he term 'purpose' in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall include any\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(c).\n\n       In light of the record before Congress, as well as the Supreme Court's caselaw defining\n\nand clarifying Congress's Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment enforcement powers, the Court\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fconcludes that Congress did not exceed its enforcement powers in enacting subsection (c). The\n\nSupreme Court's decision in United States v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145697\"><a href=\"/opinion/145697/united-states-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006) illustrates why.\n\nThere, the plaintiff, a disabled inmate in a Georgia state jail, claimed that he was confined to a\n\ncell so small that he could not move his wheelchair and that he had to sit in his own bodily waste\n\nbecause prison officials refused to help him use the inaccessible toilets and showers. Id. at 156.\n\nHe argued that this treatment violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 12131\n\net seq. (\"ADA\"), and that Title II of the ADA abrogated Georgia's sovereign immunity. Id. The\n\nEleventh Circuit concluded that the ADA's attempted abrogation of Georgia's sovereign\n\nimmunity was invalid. Id. The Supreme Court reversed. Id. at 160. It first noted that if the\n\nplaintiff's allegations were true, his treatment likely constituted an independent Fourteenth\n\nAmendment violation (i.e., an Eighth Amendment violation incorporated against the states\n\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment) as well as a violation of the ADA. Id. at 157. The Court\n\nthen explained that, \"[w]hile the Members of this Court have disagreed regarding the scope of\n\nCongress's 'prophylactic' enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no one\n\ndoubts that § 5 grants Congress the power to 'enforce . . . the provisions' of the Amendment by\n\ncreating private remedies against the States for actual violations of those provisions.\" Id. at 158\n\n(internal citations omitted). Because the plaintiff claimed actual violations of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, Congress had broad remedial powers, including the usually disfavored power of\n\nabrogating a state's sovereign immunity. Id. at 158-59.\n\n       Here, subsection (c) forbids purposeful discrimination. By definition, purposeful\n\ndiscrimination by state actors on the basis of race violates the Constitution.

Hence, the amendment to Section 5 in\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\fsubsection (c) forbids only conduct that constitutes an actual Fourteenth Amendment violation,\n\nso Congress's enforcement powers are at their broadest. See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 158-59.\n\nSubsection (c) differs in just one way from a straightforward ban on unconstitutional conduct:\n\ninstead of putting the onus on the alleged victim to prove discrimination, the burden is shifted to\n\nthe state actor to prove the absence of discrimination. The Supreme Court has previously\n\napproved this burden-shifting procedure, see Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 334-35, and such burden-\n\nshifting seems far less intrusive than the abrogation of sovereign immunity approved in Georgia.\n\nSee 546 U.S. at 158-59. Given the substantial evidence that Congress amassed for the necessity\n\nof an amendment to Section 5, and the narrowness of the amendment Congress chose, the Court\n\nfinds that subsection (c) lies comfortably within Congress's enforcement powers.\n\n       In reality, the core of plaintiffs' challenge to subsection (c) is not about Congress's\n\nenforcement powers, but about the fear that the Department of Justice will use the purpose prong\n\nto extract its preferred results in the redistricting context. Plfs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. (\"Plfs.' MSJ\") at 28-30, 41-42; Plfs.' Opp. at 29-32. The witnesses who testified\n\nagainst the Bossier II \"fix\" were motivated by the same concern. See Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 11 (July 13, 2006) (statement of Michael Carvin); id. at 14 (statement of Abigail\n\nThernstrom); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 29-31 (Nov. 1, 2005) (statement of Roger Clegg).\n\nThe government argues in response that the Supreme Court's opinions in Miller and Shaw II\n\nmade clear that it may not so employ the purpose prong, and points to its regulations that\n\nunderscore the point.

Moreover, the government argues, neither plaintiffs\n\nnor the Congressional witnesses identified any instance of the Department of Justice's improper\n\nreliance on the purpose prong since Miller.

While it is true that the\n\nSupreme Court implicitly criticized the Justice Department for such behavior in 2000 in Bossier\n\nII, see 528 U.S. at 324, the objection that was the basis for that case was originally made in 1993,\n\ntwo years before Miller.\n\n       Whatever the merits of this concern, it is not the proper subject of a facial challenge to\n\nsubsection (c), and plaintiffs have made clear that they have disavowed their as-applied\n\nchallenge. \"In determining whether a law is facially invalid, we must be careful not to go\n\nbeyond the statute's facial requirements and speculate about hypothetical or imaginary cases.\"\n\nWash.

But given the lack of any\n\ncurrent indication of such practices, this Court will not invalidate subsection (c) based on\n\nspeculation.\n\n               3. Subsections (b) and (d)\n\n       The challenge to subsections (b) and (d) revolves around the standard to be applied in\n\ndeciding whether to preclear districting and other changes that have the potential to dilute\n\nminority votes. It is therefore appropriate to repeat some of Shelby County's findings about\n\nintentionally discriminatory vote dilution.\n\n       The Congressional record contained significant evidence of intentionally dilutive actions\n\nin the districting context. For instance, Congress heard testimony about an episode in which\n\nMississippi state legislators opposed a redistricting plan that would have given African-\n\nAmericans an increased opportunity to elect representatives of their choice, referring to the plan\n\n\"on the House floor as the 'black plan' and privately as 'the n-plan.'\" S. Rep. No. 109-295, at 14.\n\nCongress also heard that during one round of redistricting, Georgia's Chair of its House\n\nReapportionment Committee told his colleagues in the Georgia legislature that he was uncertain\n\nas to the outcome of the state's redistricting process, \"because the Justice Department is trying to\n\nmake us draw nigger districts and I don't want to draw nigger districts.\" See Busbee, 549 F.\n\nSupp. at 501; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 67; House Hearing, 109th Cong. 54 (Nov. 9,\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f2005) (prepared statement of Laughlin McDonald).\n\n        Congress was also provided information that, in 2002, the Justice Department objected to\n\na redistricting plan proposed by the city of Albany, Georgia, based on the determination that\n\nAlbany had not \"carried its burden of showing that its proposed plan was not designed with the\n\nintent to limit and retrogress the increased black voting strength.\" See 1 House Hearing, Scope,\n\n109th Cong. 846 (Oct. 25, 2005) (Schlozman Appendix). The Justice Department examined\n\nAlbany's history of redistricting with respect to Ward 4, which, it found, revealed an \"intent to\n\nmaintain Ward 4 as a district that remains at the . . . level of 70 percent white, thus eliminating\n\nany ability of black voters to elect a candidate of choice in this district.\" Id. After the black\n\npopulation in Ward 4 doubled from 20% to 40% during the 1980s, Albany adopted a\n\nredistricting plan that reduced the Ward's population to 30% black. Then, after the black\n\npopulation in Ward 4 increased from 30% to almost 51% during the 1990s, the city sought\n\npreclearance for another redistricting plan that would have reduced the population in Ward 4 to\n\n30% black. Id. at 846-47. The Justice Department objected to the proposed plan, noting that\n\n\"implicit\" in the plan was \"an intent to limit black political strength in the city to no more than\n\nfour districts.\" Id. at 847.\n\n        Another intent-based objection was lodged against the 2001 redistricting plan proposed\n\nby Milden, Louisiana, in which the city \"explicitly decided to eliminate one of the three existing\n\nmajority minority districts,\" even though \"it was not compelled to redraw the district,\" and had\n\nbeen \"presented with an alternative that met all of its legitimate criteria while maintaining the\n\nminority community's electoral ability.\" Id. at 1150-52. The Justice Department interposed yet\n\nanother intent-based objection to a redistricting plan submitted by Sumter County, South\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fCarolina, that same year, after the county council \"explicitly decided to . . . eliminate one of the\n\nfour existing majority minority districts\" despite the fact that the district's elimination had been\n\n\"easily avoidable.\" See 2 House Hearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 2082-84 (Oct. 25, 2005)\n\n(Schlozman Appendix). In explaining the basis of its objection, the Justice Department noted\n\nthat the county had not been forced to redraw the district and that it had rejected an alternative,\n\nnon-retrogressive plan. Id. at 2083-84. Under the circumstances, the Justice Department was\n\nunable to conclude \"that the action in question was not motivated by a discriminatory intent to\n\nretrogress.\" Id. at 2084.\n\n       The record revealed many more similar instances. See, e.g., 1 House Hearing, Scope,\n\n109th Cong. 433 (Oct. 25, 2005) (Schlozman Appendix) (objecting to 1998 redistricting plan by\n\nTallapoosa County, Alabama, because \"the history of the instant redistricting process and its\n\nresults raise serious concerns that the county . . . purposely impaired the ability of black voters to\n\nelect a candidate of choice\"); id. at 412 (objecting to Greensboro, Alabama's 1993 redistricting\n\nplan on the ground that \"the opportunity for black voters to elect a representative of their choice .\n\n. . appears to have been constrained deliberately\"); id. at 1410 (objecting to Mississippi's 1991\n\nstatewide legislative redistricting plan where it appeared \"that the proposed plan is calculated not\n\nto provide black voters in the Delta with the equal opportunity for representation required by the\n\nVoting Rights Act\"); id. at 830 (objecting to 2000 redistricting plan for Webster County,\n\nGeorgia's board of education, where the plan was created shortly after the county had elected its\n\nfirst majority-black board, and the county's proffered reasons for the plan appeared to be \"merely\n\npretexts for intentionally decreasing the opportunity of minority voters to participate in the\n\nelectoral process\"); id. at 1611 (objecting to 1997 redistricting plan by Grenada, Mississippi,\n\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fbased on \"substantial direct and circumstantial evidence of discriminatory purpose\"); id. at 1516\n\n(refusing to withdraw objection to Greenville, Mississippi's 1991 redistricting plan, which\n\n\"appeared to have been motivated by a desire on the part of white city councilmembers to retain\n\nwhite control of the city's governing body,\" and explaining that since the plan's proposal, \"white\n\ncity officials [have] continue[d] to engage in race-based decisionmaking and to design schemes\n\nthe purpose of which is to avoid black control of city government\").\n\n       In addition to these examples, the legislative record included judicial decisions denying\n\npreclearance that relied on evidence of intentional discrimination. The 1990 redistricting in\n\nGeorgia -- in which Joe Mack Wilson, Chair of the state's House Reapportionment Committee,\n\nstated he did not want to draw \"nigger districts\" -- has already been discussed. In a more recent\n\ndeclaratory judgment action, the Louisiana House of Representatives sought preclearance for its\n\n2001 statewide redistricting plan, which eliminated a majority-black district in Orleans Parish,\n\nand failed to create a comparable district anywhere else in the state. See Nw. Austin I, 573 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 256; Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 28 (May 16, 2006) (responses of Theodore S.\n\nArrington to questions of Sens. Cornyn, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, and Kohl); Senate Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 152 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw responses); Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 42-44 (June 21,\n\n2006) (responses of Debo Adegbile to questions of Sens. Kennedy, Leahy, Cornyn, and Coburn).\n\nIn the course of defending their plan, Louisiana officials admitted that they had intentionally\n\n\"'obliterated'\" the majority-black district in order to achieve what they characterized as\n\n\"proportional\" representation for white voters in Orleans Parish. See Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J., La. House of Reps. v. Ashcroft, Civ. A. No. 02-62 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2003); see also\n\nSenate Hearing, 109th Cong. 43 (June 21, 2006) (Adegbile responses). But in selectively\n\n\n\n                                                 52\n\fapplying the theory of \"proportional representation\" to advantage only white voters in a\n\nparticular area of the state, Louisiana officials ignored the fact that it was the black population in\n\nOrleans Parish, not the white population, that had increased during the preceding decade. See\n\nSenate Hearing, 109th Cong. 28 (May 16, 2006) (Arrington responses). Moreover, the state\n\nmade no attempt to remedy blacks' statewide under-representation in proportion to their\n\npercentage of the population, despite its avowed desire to achieve proportional representation for\n\nwhite voters in a particular area of the state. See Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., La.\n\nHouse of Reps. v. Ashcroft, Civ. A. No. 02-62 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2003); Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 43 (June 21, 2006) (Adegbile responses); Nw. Austin I, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 256.\n\n       The Congressional record also contained many examples of changes to voting procedures\n\noutside the districting context that the Department of Justice found to be motivated by\n\nunconstitutional discriminatory purpose. For instance, an intent-based objection was interposed\n\nin response to Wilson County, North Carolina's 1986 change to its system for electing county\n\ncommissioners, in light of the Justice Department's determination that the county's method of\n\nelection had been purposefully \"designed and intended to limit the number of commissioners\n\nblack voters would be able to elect.\" 2 House Hearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 1731 (Schlozman\n\nAppendix). In the context of annexations, the Justice Department issued an objection in 1990 to\n\nthe decision by Monroe, Louisiana, to annex certain wards for the Monroe City Court,\n\nexplaining that the annexations would have reduced the black percentage of the City Court's\n\njurisdiction from 48.4% to 39.2%. 1 House Hearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 927 (Oct. 25, 2005)\n\n(Schlozman Appendix). The Justice Department also expressed concern regarding the timing of\n\nthe annexations, noting that one of the annexed wards \"had been eligible to be added to the City\n\n\n\n                                                  53\n\fCourt jurisdiction since at least 1970,\" but that there had been \"little or no interest in\n\nimplementing this change until immediately prior to the 1984 City Court primary election, which\n\nwe understand was marked by the presence of the first black candidate for the City Court.\" See\n\nid. 927-28; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 23. Similarly, the Justice Department in 1997\n\nobjected to the annexations proposed by the city of Webster, Texas, where \"the city's annexation\n\nchoices appear[ed] to have been tainted, if only in part, by an invidious racial purpose.\" 2 House\n\nHearing, Scope, 109th Cong. 2492 (Oct. 25, 2005) (Schlozman Appendix).\n\n       The Congressional record was thus replete with evidence of intentionally discriminatory\n\nvote dilution, particularly in the districting context. Keeping that evidence in mind, the Court\n\nwill now turn to consideration of the evidence Congress gathered about the possible\n\nconsequences of the Supreme Court's opinion in Georgia v. Ashcroft. But to begin with, a brief\n\nreview of the caselaw interpreting the \"effects\" prong of Section 5 is useful.\n\n       Section 5(a) provides that no change to voting procedures can be precleared if it \"will\n\nhave the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color[.]\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(a).

According to Beer, the purpose of Section 5 was to \"insure that no voting-procedure\n\nchanges would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities\n\nwith respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\" Id. at 141. The Beer Court\n\nadded that \"an ameliorative new legislative apportionment cannot violate § 5 unless the new\n\napportionment itself so discriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution.\"\n\nId. Under Beer, then, the effects prong of Section 5 was solely concerned with retrogression,\n\n\n\n                                                  54\n\fi.e., changes in voting practices or procedures that made the situation of minority voters worse.\n\n       The Beer standard was not so pellucid that it eliminated any possible questions about the\n\ninterpretation and application of the effects prong, but nonetheless, the Supreme Court did not\n\naddress the meaning of that prong again until Georgia v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130158\"><a href=\"/opinion/130158/georgia-v-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003). There,\n\nthe Court considered in depth what it meant to make the situation of minority voters worse.\n\nAshcroft arose as a result of the 2000 redistricting in Georgia. Id. at 469. The Court explained\n\nthat \"a substantial majority of black voters in Georgia vote Democratic, [and] all elected black\n\nrepresentatives in the General Assembly are Democrats.\" Id. In the 2000 round of redistricting,\n\n\"[t]he goal of the Democratic leadership -- black and white -- was to maintain the number of\n\nmajority-minority districts and also increase the number of Democratic Senate seats.\" Id. To do\n\nso, the Democratic leadership agreed to a plan \"unpacking\" certain majority-minority districts\n\nwith very high concentrations of black voters. Id. at 469-71. Thus, the concentration of black\n\nvoters was reduced in some districts, and black voters -- a \"substantial majority\" of whom\n\nreliably voted Democratic -- were spread to other districts to increase Democratic candidates'\n\nchances of success. Id.\n\n       Instead of seeking administrative preclearance from the Attorney General, Georgia\n\ninstituted an action seeking judicial preclearance. Id. at 471. A three-judge panel denied\n\npreclearance on the grounds that the plan would \"diminish African American voting strength in\"\n\nthe unpacked districts, and that Georgia had \"failed to present any . . . evidence\" that the\n\nretrogression in those districts \"will be offset by gains in other districts.\" Georgia v. Ashcroft,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2485427\"><a href=\"/opinion/2485427/georgia-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (D.D.C. 2002). Georgia appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nSee Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 475.\n\n\n\n                                                 55\n\f       The Supreme Court's task was to divine whether the districting plan, based on a complex\n\nmix of partisanship, incumbency protection, and compliance with the Voting Rights Act, \"'would\n\nlead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise\n\nof the electoral franchise.'\" 539 U.S. at 462 (quoting Beer, 425 U.S. at 141). In answering that\n\nquestion, the Supreme Court set out a lengthy \"totality of the circumstances\" test that courts\n\nevaluating retrogression should consider. 539 U.S. at 480-84. The Court emphasized that \"the\n\nability of a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice remains an integral feature in any § 5\n\nanalysis.\" Id. at 484. But, the Court said, it \"cannot be dispositive.\" Id. at 480. Rather,\n\n       [i]n order to maximize the electoral success of a minority group, a State may\n       choose to create a certain number of \"safe\" districts, in which it is highly likely\n       that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice.\n       Alternatively, a State may choose to create a greater number of districts in which\n       it is likely -- although perhaps not quite as likely as under the benchmark plan --\n       that minority voters will be able to elect candidates of their choice.\n           Section 5 does not dictate that a State must pick one of these methods of\n       redistricting over another. Either option will present the minority group with its\n       own array of electoral risks and benefits, and presents hard choices about what\n       would truly maximize minority electoral success.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In addition to the choice between fewer\n\ncompletely \"safe\" districts and more less safe districts, the Court wrote that the analysis should\n\ninclude whether a plan added or subtracted \"influence districts\" -- districts \"where minority\n\nvoters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not decisive,\n\nrole in the electoral process.\" Id. at 482. Finally, the Court added two additional considerations\n\nto its totality of the circumstances test: \"the comparative position of legislative leadership,\n\ninfluence, and power for representatives of the benchmark majority-minority districts\" and\n\nwhether minority-preferred representatives supported the plan. Id. at 483-84 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).\n\n\n                                                  56\n\f       Congress reacted to Ashcroft in 2006 by adding subsections (b) and (d) to Section 5.\n\nThose amendments provide that\n\n       (b) Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or\n       procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose of or will have the effect of\n       diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or\n       color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b (f)(2) of this\n       title, to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to\n       vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section.\n       ...\n       (d) The purpose of subsection (b) of this section is to protect the ability of such\n       citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b), (d). Hence, instead of allowing courts and the Department of Justice to\n\ntake into account a wide variety of potential indicators of minority voting effectiveness in\n\nconducting the preclearance analysis, Congress clarified that Section 5 is focused on minorities'\n\nability \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\" In the House Report accompanying the\n\nbill, Congress explained that the amendments were meant to return to the analysis articulated in\n\nBeer. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 71.\n\n       Unlike the debate over the Bossier II fix, which nearly all witnesses agreed was\n\nnecessary and appropriate, the Ashcroft fix was the subject of extended debate. A consistent\n\ntheme, however, was that the standard laid out in Ashcroft was impossibly challenging to\n\nadminister, particularly within the 60-day period in which the Department of Justice must make\n\npreclearance decisions. Witnesses called it \"an unworkable standard,\" Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 8 (May 16, 2006) (Arrington statement), \"subjective, abstract, and impressionistic,\" House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 49 (Nov. 9, 2005) (McDonald statement), \"amorphous [and] easily\n\nmanipulable . . . an open invitation to mischief . . . [and] poorly defined and virtually impossible\n\nto meaningfully administer.\" Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 39 (May 17, 2006) (Days responses).\n\n\n\n                                                 57\n\fRobert Kengle, the former Deputy Chief of the Voting Section of the Justice Department's Civil\n\nRights Division, testified that Ashcroft had \"introduced factors into the retrogression analysis\n\nthat make the Section 5 process more complicated and burdensome for everybody, not just for\n\nthe Department of Justice but for the jurisdictions that have to comply with it as well.\" House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 889 (Oct. 18, 2005) (statement of Robert A. Kengle). Kengle also worried\n\nthat Ashcroft would make preclearance decisions \"less predictable and more open to subjective\n\njudgments, individual preconceptions and even political biases.\" Id. A hearing in the House\n\nopened with the question, \"Georgia v. Ashcroft: can it be made workable?\" House Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 2 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Rep. Conyers statement).\n\n       Witnesses were particularly concerned about the introduction of \"influence\" districts into\n\nthe Section 5 calculus. \"Influence\" districts, as previously explained, are those where \"minority\n\nvoters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not decisive,\n\nrole in the electoral process.\" Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 482.5 Congressional witnesses testified that\n\na key problem with the Ashcroft opinion was the lack of a standard that would allow courts and\n\n       5\n           Influence districts contrast with majority-minority, crossover, and opportunity districts.\nThe meaning of those terms is subject to considerable debate. Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 235-\n37, 241-42. As used in this opinion, majority-minority districts are those where a minority group\nis able to elect its \"preferred candidates of choice\" without crossover voting from either white\nvoters or voters of a different minority group. See id. at 241-42 (discussing conceptual issues in\ndefining majority-minority districts). \"Crossover\" districts, sometimes called coalition districts,\nare those where minority voters can elect their candidates of choice with certain \"crossover\"\nvotes from white or other voters who support the minority group's candidates of choice. See\nBartlett v. Strickland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145901\"><a href=\"/opinion/145901/bartlett-v-strickland/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1242-43 (2009) (discussing different types of districts).\n\"Crossover\" districts are different than influence districts because the minority voters are\nsufficiently numerous that they can choose the candidate, presumably because they form a\nmajority of voters in the primary elections, rather than choosing among white voters' candidates\nof choice. See id. at 1242; see also Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 236, 242-43. Finally, this Court\nwill use \"opportunity district\" as an all-purpose term for those jurisdictions where minority\nvoters can elect their candidates of choice. Both majority-minority districts and crossover\ndistricts are opportunity districts.\n\n                                                 58\n\fthe Justice Department to determine which districts were \"influence\" districts. Theodore Shaw\n\nexplained that \"[w]e don't know what 'influence districts' really mean[s].\" He asked:\n\n       How is influence effectively measured within DOJ’s sixty-day administrative\n       window? Does one look to roll call votes? Do those votes need to be on issues\n       that have a discernible race element or just a discernible position preferred by\n       minority group members? Is it enough if candidates for office campaign in\n       minority communities? Must influence be consistently in evidence or is\n       occasional influence sufficient?\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 13, 25 (Nov. 9, 2005) (statements of Theodore M. Shaw). Another\n\nwitness cited a study showing that a group's influence on a given legislator does not linearly\n\nincrease with the group's size, as one might expect, but rather has a \"curvi-linear relationship\" to\n\nthe group's size. House Hearing, 109th Cong. 57 (Nov. 9, 2005) (McDonald statement).\n\nMoreover, as Representative Feeney pointed out, all of these problems were compounded by the\n\nfact that what constituted an influence district would \"change from candidate to candidate and\n\ncycle to cycle and geographic area to geographic area.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 84 (Oct.\n\n25, 2005) (statement of Rep. Tom Feeney).\n\n       Several witnesses also testified that they were troubled by the fact that the Ashcroft\n\nopinion gave no guidance as to when and whether majority-minority districts or other\n\nopportunity districts could be traded for influence districts, and how many influence districts\n\nwould make up for the loss of an opportunity district. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 168 (May 9,\n\n2006) (Shaw responses); Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 116-17 (May 16, 2006) (responses of\n\nRichard H. Pildes to questions of Sens. Specter, Cornyn, Coburn, and Kohl); Senate Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 58-59 (May 17, 2006) (Days responses); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 139-40 &\n\nn.10 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement); House Hearing, 109th Cong. 49-50 (May 4,\n\n2006) (Adegbile prepared statement). The lack of clarity about how to define influence districts,\n\n\n                                                 59\n\falong with the uncertainty about when influence districts could be traded for opportunity\n\ndistricts, combined to create what several witnesses saw as the most significant problem with\n\nAshcroft: the opinion might allow jurisdictions to substantially dilute minority voting strength\n\nunder the guise of creating more influence districts. In the most extreme scenario, a jurisdiction\n\ncould carve up every opportunity district into a series of influence districts where minorities\n\nmight actually have no influence at all. Such a result would give official legal cover to the\n\nblatant voting discrimination that Section 5 was designed to prevent, and would judicially\n\nsanction a return to the days of districts designed to spread minority voters as widely as possible.\n\nCf. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 84 (May 17, 2006) (responses of Armand Derfner to questions\n\nof Sens. Cornyn, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, and Schumer) (\"In this century, Mississippi’s\n\ncongressional district lines had been traditionally drawn from south to north, which meant that\n\nthe [largely black] Mississippi Delta was one congressional district. . . . [A]s soon as blacks\n\nstarted voting, and especially with the Voting Rights Act, . . . [Mississippi changed] the historic\n\npattern so that the new congressional lines went from east to west, thus fragmenting the black\n\npopulation in the Delta.\").\n\n       Even in less extreme scenarios, a jurisdiction could substantially dilute the voting power\n\nof minorities through substitution of influence districts for opportunity districts. See Senate\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 168-69 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw responses) (Ashcroft allows \"jurisdictions to\n\ncloak intentional discrimination under [its] intangible framework\"); House Hearing, 109th Cong.\n\n50 (Nov. 9, 2005) (McDonald statement) (\"The minority influence theory, moreover, is\n\nfrequently nothing more than a guise for diluting minority voting strength.\"); Senate Hearing,\n\n109th Cong. 12 (May 17, 2006) (statement of Nathaniel Persily) (\"The risk of Georgia v.\n\n\n\n                                                 60\n\fAshcroft is that . . . under the cloak of influence districts, a jurisdiction would then break up a\n\ncohesive minority community into much smaller districts in which they really had no influence\n\nat all.\"). Professor Richard Pildes, who \"agree[d] with the Court on the Georgia facts\" and did\n\nnot support the \"fix,\" noted that even supporters of the Ashcroft decision were \"sometimes\n\nworried about the possible implications of the decision down the road,\" and thought that the\n\nhearings should clarify that a jurisdiction could not trade every opportunity district for influence\n\ndistricts. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 116-17 (May 16, 2006) (Pildes responses).\n\n       Congress also heard testimony about Ashcroft's holding that states are free to choose\n\namong the various ways of ensuring that minorities have an equal opportunity to participate\n\npolitically -- in other words, that states may choose between majority-minority districts,\n\ninfluence districts, crossover districts, and other types of participation. Robert Kengle, who\n\nagreed with parts of the Ashcroft decision and the theoretical importance of influence districts,\n\ntestified that he was \"quite uncomfortable with the notion that 'the State may choose . . . to risk\n\nhaving fewer minority representatives,' which strikes me as letting the fox guard the henhouse.\"\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 135, 139 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement) (quoting\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. at 464). The House Report reflected a specific Congressional finding that,\n\ngiven the record before Congress, covered jurisdictions should not be allowed unfettered\n\ndiscretion to choose among theories of representation. H.R. Rep. 109-478, at 70.\n\n       One final concern expressed by several witnesses was that consideration of influence\n\ndistricts would inject undue partisanship into the Voting Rights Act. Ashcroft itself, of course,\n\ngrew out of an attempt to maximize Democratic strength while complying with the Act. As one\n\nwitness bluntly summarized:\n\n\n\n                                                  61\n\f       [T]o the extent that I can imagine what measures would be used to determine\n       whether substantive representation or influence has been enhanced to prevent\n       retrogression, these measures amount to simply helping Democratic Party\n       candidates. In virtually every state legislature, in the Congress, and in many local\n       jurisdictions, minority representatives -- especially African Americans -- are\n       strongly allied with the Democratic Party. Helping Democratic Party candidates\n       would be argued to be equivalent to increasing minority voter influence and\n       helping minority substantive representation. In other words, influence districts, if\n       seen as a replacement for opportunities for minority voters to elect representatives\n       of their choice, would become simply a rationale for creating Democratic Party\n       gerrymanders.\n\nSenate Hearing, 109th Cong. 33 (May 16, 2006) (Arrington responses). But this was\n\nproblematic, because, as Theodore Shaw pointed out, \"a sustained identity between minority and\n\npartisan interests\" cannot always be assumed given that \"partisan links [may] weaken and shift,\n\nas they historically have done.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 26 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Shaw prepared\n\nstatement).\n\n       More broadly, Congress heard testimony that the Ashcroft standard too often subsumed\n\nthe goals of minority voters in favor of the goals of individual legislators and their political\n\nparties. For instance, the fact that minority legislators supported a given redistricting plan might\n\nmean that it protected their own districts, not that it was the best plan for minority voters. House\n\nHearing, 109th Cong. 22 (Oct. 25, 2005) (prepared statement of Robert Hunter). Asking judges\n\nor Justice Department attorneys to assess whether a given legislator had a sufficiently important\n\nleadership position -- and was likely to retain that leadership position after an election -- was\n\nseen as unrealistic. Id. at 25. Indeed, one of the Justice Department's rare attempts to apply the\n\nAshcroft standard before it was overturned was laid out in a 73-page memo that was later leaked,\n\nand voting rights scholars were highly critical of the Justice Department's efforts. See, e.g.,\n\nAbigail Thernstrom, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act: By Now, a Murky Mess, 5 GEO. J.L. &\n\n\n\n                                                  62\n\fPUB. POL'Y 41, 59-61 (2007) (\"Throughout the memo, the career attorneys attempted to read\n\npolitical tealeaves, predicting the race or political sympathies of candidates who would be\n\nelected from various districts under the new plan. It was a practice invited by the Ashcroft\n\nCourt, but . . . attorneys in Washington were (inevitably) not very good at it.\"). Summarizing the\n\nproblem, Robert Kengle testified:\n\n       Finally, in my view the Ashcroft decision makes its greatest departure from the\n       Supreme Court's other voting rights jurisprudence by introducing explicit partisan\n       calculations into the Section 5 review process. Creating influence and coalition\n       districts with partisan allies may in fact be the best way to maximize minority\n       voting strength in particular cases, and I think minority citizens and legislators\n       should be allowed considerable latitude to do so.\n          But to embody partisan calculations and tradeoffs into the Voting Rights Act\n       itself has not been well thought out and provides a means and motive not only to\n       politicize enforcement of Section 5, but also to undermine confidence that the Act\n       will be enforced in a way that transcends party politics.\n\nHouse Hearing, 109th Cong. 143 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement). Condensing all of\n\nthese concerns, voting rights practitioner Debo Adegbile speculated that under the Ashcroft test,\n\nthe Section 5 analysis would become so complex that \"the statute will start to collapse of its own\n\nweight.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 58 (May 4, 2006) (Adegbile prepared statement).\n\n       To summarize, Congress gathered extensive evidence that discriminatory and dilutive\n\ntechniques remained a significant problem, and that the Ashcroft standard did not remedy -- and\n\ncould easily worsen -- the problem. Congress therefore chose to overrule Ashcroft with the\n\namendments codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973c(b) and (d). A striking feature of the Ashcroft \"fix,\"\n\nhowever, was the widespread uncertainty about what it meant. As one law professor put it,\n\n\"Congress did not so much reverse Ashcroft as remand it to the courts with equivocal\n\ninstructions.\" J. Morgan Kousser, The Strange, Ironic Career of Section 5 of the Voting Rights\n\nAct, 1965-2007, 86 TEX. L. REV. 667, 755 (2008). One of the effects of the amendments is\n\n\n                                                63\n\fundisputed: they made clear that influence districts could not be substituted for opportunity\n\ndistricts. Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 235-37, 247. What the amendments did not resolve,\n\nhowever, was whether crossover districts were protected from retrogression and what sort of\n\ntradeoffs between majority-minority and crossover districts were appropriate. Some witnesses\n\nconcluded that the Ashcroft fix was a simple return to the status quo ante, i.e., the Beer test,\n\nwhile others disagreed. Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 149 (May 9, 2006) (responses of Laughlin\n\nMcDonald to questions of Sens. Specter, Kennedy, Schumer and Cornyn); Senate Hearing, 109th\n\nCong. 168-69 (May 9, 2006) (Shaw responses). But as Nathaniel Persily has explained, \"[t]he\n\nproblem is that there is disagreement about what the standard under Beer was.\" Persily, Promise\n\nand Pitfalls 234.\n\n       The text of Beer certainly does not answer questions about crossover districts and\n\ntradeoffs, and the Supreme Court had never attempted to clarify the issue until Ashcroft. Nor\n\ndoes the text of the amendments obviously answer that question. The House and Senate reports\n\nvividly illustrate the amendments' ambiguity. The House report provides that \"[v]oting changes\n\nthat leave a minority group less able to elect a preferred candidate of choice, either directly or\n\nwhen coalesced with other voters, cannot be precleared under Section 5.\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-\n\n478, at 71. Hence, according to the House report, crossover districts as well as majority-\n\nminority districts are protected under the amendments. The Senate report presents a truly bizarre\n\nsituation. The Senate unanimously voted to renew Section 5 on July 20, 2006. S. Rep. 109-295,\n\nat 54-55. A draft Senate report had been circulated, but instead of accepting it, the Republican\n\nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee produced their own report six days after the passage\n\nof the bill, over the vehement protests of the Democratic members of the Committee. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 64\n\fAccording to that Report, subsections (b) and (d) were intended only \"to protect naturally\n\noccurring majority-minority districts,\" not crossover districts. Id. at 19. Moreover, the\n\nRepublican Senate Report specifically stated that \"coalition or influence districts\" could never be\n\nsubstituted for naturally occurring majority-minority districts. Id. Although this Court will not\n\nrely on a one-party, post hoc report as evidence of what the amendments actually mean, the\n\nreport does reflect disagreement among members of Congress as to their meaning.\n\n        In the context of this facial challenge, then, the Court must construe the amendments,\n\nbearing in mind that they should not be found unconstitutional unless there is no plausible\n\nconstitutional construction.

Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr.\n\nTrades Council, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112042\"><a href=\"/opinion/112042/edward-j-debartolo-corp-v-florida-gulf-coast-building-constr-trades/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1988); David L.

The key interpretive question, as\n\npreviously explained, is whether the amendments permit the Section 5 analysis to include\n\ncrossover districts and whether they permit any tradeoffs between crossover and majority-\n\nminority districts. Looking solely to the text of the amendments, the Court believes that they\n\npermit both. Subsection (b) provides that \"Any [voting procedure] . . . that has the purpose of or\n\nwill have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of\n\nrace or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b).

Instead, they can only choose between candidates preferred by other groups. In any\n\nevent, the legislative history makes overwhelmingly clear that influence districts are no longer a\n\nfactor in the Section 5 analysis under the amendments. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-478, at 70. In\n\ncrossover districts, however, minority voters form a sufficiently large percentage of the\n\nregistered voter population to select a \"preferred candidate of choice\" in the primary, and to elect\n\nthat preferred candidate -- with crossover voting from those who are not part of the minority\n\ngroup -- in the general election. See Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 236 (citing Bernard Grofman,\n\nLisa Handley & David Lubin, Drawing Effective Minority Districts: A Conceptual Framework\n\nand Some Empirical Evidence, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. REV. 1383, 1407-09 (2001)). Hence, the Court finds\n\nthat crossover districts fit within the statutory scheme. Moreover, the Court sees nothing in the\n\ntext of the amendments that would prevent a certain amount of tradeoff between majority-\n\nminority districts and crossover districts, assuming that minority voters indeed have the ability to\n\nelect preferred candidates of their choice in the crossover districts.\n\n        But the amendments did more than just remove influence districts from the preclearance\n\nanalysis: they also affirmed that minorities' \"ability to elect,\" not the \"totality of the\n\n\n\n        6\n          This Court recognizes that this interpretation conflicts with the three-justice plurality's\nreading of a similar phrase in the Section 2 context in Bartlett, 129 S.

Hence,\n\ncourts and the Justice Department can no longer consider many of the factors that the Ashcroft\n\nCourt identified as relevant to the totality of the circumstances test. Specifically, the\n\npreclearance analysis can no longer consider minority-preferred politicians' views of the\n\nproposed change, nor can it consider whether the position or power of a particular minority-\n\npreferred politician could substitute in some way for the ability to elect. More generally, any\n\nfactor that is not related to minorities' \"ability to elect\" is off the table. This principle is not\n\nlimitless, of course: courts and the Justice Department are required to consider certain\n\nconstitutional mandates, including compliance with the one person one vote principle and equal\n\nprotection principles, and caselaw and history have established that the preclearance analysis\n\nincludes consideration of population growth and decline. Infra at 89-90. But the universe of\n\nrationales that can justify a change to voting procedures is now considerably smaller than it was\n\nunder Ashcroft.\n\n        The third and final question under Boerne is whether the amendments, so construed, are a\n\ncongruent and proportional response to the pattern of unconstitutional behavior that Congress\n\nidentified and the problems that Congress found infected the Ashcroft standard. It is important\n\nto keep in mind that plaintiffs' challenge here is only to the amendments; the Court has already\n\nfound that the general preclearance procedure is a congruent and proportional remedy to the\n\nunconstitutional behavior Congress identified.

Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519-20. That is, the question is whether the\n\n\n\n                                                   67\n\flaw can \"be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\" Id.\n\nat 532. Courts must afford Congress \"wide latitude\" in deciding what legislation will enforce,\n\nrather than define, a constitutional guarantee. Id. at 519-20. In conducting the third step of the\n\nBoerne analysis, the Supreme Court has been particularly cognizant of the federalism costs of\n\nthe challenged law. In Boerne itself, for instance, the Court found that RFRA exceeded\n\nCongress's enforcement power in part because it was \"a considerable congressional intrusion into\n\nthe States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of\n\ntheir citizens,\" and imposed \"a heavy litigation burden on the states.\" Id. at 534.\n\n       To discern whether subsections (b) and (d) can \"be understood as responsive to, or\n\ndesigned to prevent\" intentional voting discrimination, it is important to keep in mind two\n\nfoundational points about voting, and about districting in particular. First, \"voting is more than\n\nan atomistic exercise.\" Bush v. Vera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118040\"><a href=\"/opinion/118040/bush-v-vera/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048-49 (Souter, J., dissenting). Voting\n\ndistricts are explicitly designed to protect certain communities of interest, whether partisan,\n\nissue-oriented, or any of a number of other characteristics.

Karlan & Daryl J. Levinson, Why Voting\n\nis Different, 84 CAL. L. REV. 1201, 1204-08, 1271-19 (1996) (hereinafter Karlan & Levinson,\n\nWhy Voting is Different). If voting and representation were perceived as a purely \"atomistic\n\nexercise,\" districting could be reduced to no more than drawing districts of equal size. But, as\n\nthe thousands of pages of opinions addressing redistricting issues show, \"traditional districting\n\nprinciples\" are aimed at much more than numerical equivalence. See Shaw v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647 (1993) (\"Shaw I\").\n\n\n\n                                                 68\n\f       The second foundational point is why racial groups are sometimes considered\n\n\"communities of interest\" that can be gathered into districts. Groups defined in part by race are\n\nconsidered communities of interests if, and only if, empirical evidence demonstrates that group\n\nmembers' voting behavior is similar. In other words, saying that members of a given racial\n\ngroup in a certain area currently vote alike is not a stereotype when it is a descriptive fact.\n\nKarlan & Levinson, Why Voting is Different 1204-08, 1217-18.

In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot be a\n\nuniversal constitutional principle.\").\n\n       The record before Congress demonstrated, first, that certain racial groups in covered\n\njurisdictions had found \"efficacious political identit[ies].\" LULAC, 548 U.S. at 435. Second, it\n\n\n\n                                                  69\n\fdemonstrated extensive intentional attempts to fragment or pack potentially cohesive racial\n\nminorities to ensure that they could not elect representatives attuned to those political interests.\n\nWithout evidence of both of those points, Congress would not have been entitled to create a\n\nremedy as sweeping and race-conscious as the preclearance procedure. But given that record\n\nevidence, Congress had the ability under its Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment enforcement\n\nauthority to design legislation to \"respon[d] to . . . or . . . prevent [that] unconstitutional\n\nbehavior.\" Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532.\n\n        The unconstitutional behavior Congress was trying to prevent was intentional vote\n\ndilution aimed at making minority votes less effective. The legislation Congress designed\n\ndirectly responds to that problem by refusing preclearance to any voting change that\n\n\"diminish[es] the ability\" of such groups \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973c(b). The legislation is thus precisely congruent to the problem, because it forbids\n\nthe entire category of behavior Congress found to be problematic. But because it also forbids\n\nsome constitutional behavior -- voting changes that reduce minority voting effectiveness, but not\n\nfor intentionally discriminatory reasons -- the Court must consider whether it is proportional to\n\nthe problem.\n\n        In judging whether subsections (b) and (d) are a proportional response to the problem, the\n\nCourt emphasizes again that proportionality of the Ashcroft standard is not at issue. But, as this\n\nCourt has construed the statute, the differences between the standards in subsections (b) and (d)\n\nand in Ashcroft are relatively limited. In the districting context, the key difference is that\n\ninfluence districts are no longer part of the Section 5 calculus. But Congress heard considerable\n\ntestimony that including consideration of influence districts in the Section 5 analysis would have\n\n\n\n                                                  70\n\fhad deeply problematic results. Allowing tradeoffs between opportunity districts and influence\n\ndistricts would have created a means to cloak intentional discrimination -- that is, intentional\n\nfragmentation of politically cohesive groups -- under the guise of creating influence districts.\n\nMoreover, as discussed below, Congress had reason to be concerned that keeping influence\n\ndistricts as part of the Section 5 analysis would leave Section 5 vulnerable to an equal protection\n\nchallenge.\n\n       The amendments also eliminated consideration of the amorphous \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\" factors, including consideration of minority-preferred legislators' views of the\n\nproposed voting changes and consideration of the position of particular minority-preferred\n\npoliticians. But Congress heard testimony that integrating such factors into Section 5 would\n\nresult in a statute that was impossible for the Department of Justice to administer effectively\n\nwithin its sixty-day window. Moreover, Congress heard testimony that the results of the\n\npreclearance process would be increasingly partisan, subjective, and unpredictable, driving up\n\ncosts for both the federal government and the affected jurisdictions. This subjectivity and\n\nunpredictability was compounded by the fact that a \"totality of the circumstances\" test could\n\ninclude unspecified factors even beyond those mentioned in Ashcroft. Given the record\n\nevidence, it is quite understandable that Congress concluded that a totality of the circumstances\n\ntest could \"undermine confidence that the Act will be enforced in a way that transcends party\n\npolitics,\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 143 (Nov. 9, 2005) (Kengle prepared statement), and\n\ncould cause Section 5 to \"collapse of its own weight.\" House Hearing, 109th Cong. 58 (May 4,\n\n2006) (Adegbile statement).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 71\n\f        The standard laid out in subsections (b) and (d) also has several important limitations.\n\nSee Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533 (\"limitations\" including \"termination dates, geographic restrictions,\n\nor egregious predicates . . . tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate\n\nunder § 5\"). First, like the rest of Section 5, the amendments are temporally and geographically\n\nlimited: they will expire after twenty-five years (that is, two redistricting cycles), and they apply\n\nonly in certain jurisdictions. Shelby County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *72-74. In the vote dilution\n\ncontext, they also have an elegant, self-executing limitation. As this Court has previously\n\nexplained, a group defined by race can be considered a community of interest for voting\n\npurposes only when empirical evidence, rather than stereotypes, demonstrates that members of\n\nthe minority group vote alike. This critical fact is built in to the \"ability to elect\" test because, as\n\nracially polarized voting decreases, the number of districts affected by Section 5 decreases as\n\nwell. As racially polarized voting decreases, majority-minority districts can frequently be\n\nreplaced with crossover districts. See Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1254-55 (Souter, J., dissenting). If\n\nracially polarized voting disappeared entirely -- such that there is no correlation between race\n\nand voting -- it would be virtually impossible for a districting plan to be retrogressive under\n\nSection 5. Persily, Promise and Pitfalls 243. Hence, should racially polarized voting\n\nsubstantially diminish before twenty-five years have passed -- and with it, the ability (and\n\nmotivation) for legislators to draw dilutive districts -- Section 5 will play a dramatically smaller\n\nrole in state voting procedures even before it officially expires.\n\n        The final consideration under Boerne is the federalism costs the amendments in\n\nsubsections (b) and (d) exact, both in terms of \"congressional intrusion into the States' traditional\n\nprerogatives\" and pragmatic costs, such as litigation costs. 521 U.S. at 534. This Court\n\n\n\n                                                  72\n\frecognizes, of course, that the Voting Rights Act as a whole represents a considerable \"intrusion\n\ninto the States' traditional prerogatives.\" But, as explained in Shelby County, that intrusion is\n\njustified by the persistent, purposeful discrimination aimed at minorities attempting to exercise\n\ntheir core constitutional voting rights. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4375001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *80. Hence, the only question\n\nhere is whether the amendments represent an intrusion beyond that imposed by the general\n\npreclearance regime.\n\n       In one sense, the federalism costs are greater under subsections (b) and (d) than they were\n\nunder Ashcroft because states have less latitude to choose among theories of representation and\n\npolitical participation. But, as this Court has construed the statute, Congress narrowed the states'\n\nlatitude only as much as necessary to accomplish its goal. States may still draw either crossover\n\nor majority-minority districts, and some tradeoff between them is appropriate. See Bartlett, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 1254-55 (Souter, J., dissenting) (recognizing in Section 2 context that \"crossover\n\ndistricts ha[ve] the value of giving States greater flexibility to draw districting plans with a fair\n\nnumber of minority-opportunity districts\"). Moreover, because influence districts are no longer\n\nprotected from retrogression, states have substantially more freedom to redraw district lines in\n\ndistricts that do not qualify as opportunity districts. In terms of pragmatic costs, subsections (b)\n\nand (d) almost certainly work in the states' favor. The complexity of the test outlined in Ashcroft\n\nwould likely have led to very difficult preclearance decisions and extraordinarily complex\n\nlitigation. By returning to a test that is substantially closer to the familiar Beer test, Congress\n\nreduced the complexity and costs of the preclearance process.\n\n       The amendments in subsections (b) and (d) sweep broadly, and they admittedly capture a\n\ncertain amount of behavior that is constitutional. But, as the Court has previously found, the\n\n\n\n                                                  73\n\fretrogression principle itself is justified by the evidence of persistent, intentional discrimination\n\nthat Congress amassed. The amendments' modification to the Beer and Ashcroft tests was\n\nnecessary to avoid giving cover to intentional discrimination and to prevent an administrability\n\nnightmare that would itself harm covered jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Court concludes that\n\nsubsections (b) and (d)'s modifications to the Beer and Ashcroft tests represent a congruent and\n\nproportional response to the problem of intentionally discriminatory dilutive techniques. Hence,\n\nthey survive plaintiffs' constitutional challenge.\n\n                                          III. COUNT II\n\n                                            A. Standing\n\n       The Court now turns to Count II of plaintiffs' complaint, which is similar to Count I's\n\nchallenge to the amendments in several ways. Both counts assert that the amendments are\n\nunconstitutional, but they rest on different theories: Count I claims that the amendments exceed\n\nCongress's enforcement powers, while Count II claims that they violate equal protection\n\nprinciples.7 Accordingly, the standing analysis for the two claims is in some respects similar.\n\nFor the same reasons discussed in part II.A, the Court finds that plaintiffs have standing to bring\n\ntheir challenge to subsections (b) and (d). Nix was injured because a referendum from which he\n\nwould have benefitted was suspended due to the operation of an allegedly unconstitutional law.\n\nUnder Akins, he has shown causation and redressability as to subsections (b) and (d). However,\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the amendments violate the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is substantively identical\nto the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (1995). The Fifth Amendment applies against the federal government,\nwhile the Fourteenth Amendment applies against the states.\n\n                                                  74\n\ffor the reasons given in part II.A, Nix does not have standing to bring an equal protection\n\nchallenge to subsection (c).\n\n       The D.C. Circuit directed this Court to consider several questions about plaintiffs' Count\n\nII standing on remand. See LaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 794-96. The Court has addressed most of\n\nthose issues in the discussion of Count I, but one additional point must be addressed here. The\n\nD.C. Circuit asked whether, given that plaintiffs' equal protection challenge is only facial,\n\nplaintiffs have \"met the requirement that litigants claiming injury from a racial classification\n\nestablish that they 'personally [have been] denied equal treatment by the challenged\n\ndiscriminatory conduct.'\" Id. at 795 (quoting United States v. Hays, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117965\"><a href=\"/opinion/117965/united-states-v-hays/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 743-44\n\n(1995)). This Court does not believe that Hays presents an obstacle for plaintiffs here.\n\nExplaining why requires reviewing one branch of the Supreme Court's equal protection\n\njurisprudence.\n\n       The Hays plaintiffs brought a claim under Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 652, which allows voters\n\nwho live in districts allegedly drawn with excessive attention to race to bring an equal protection\n\nchallenge. A Shaw claim is not a vote dilution claim, but rather the \"analytically distinct claim\"\n\nthat a voter experiences a stigmatic harm when she is placed into a district because of her race.\n\nId.; see also Miller, 515 U.S. at 911-913. The plaintiffs in Hays attempted to bring a Shaw\n\nchallenge to the creation of a district in which they did not live. 515 U.S. at 739. The Supreme\n\nCourt found that they did not have standing. The Court explained that the Shaw I plaintiffs had\n\nstanding because they had suffered a particularized stigmatic injury, but that the Hays plaintiffs\n\nhad not suffered any such stigmatic injury because they did not allege that they themselves had\n\nbeen placed into a particular district because of their race. Id. at 744-45.\n\n\n\n                                                 75\n\f       Like the plaintiffs in Hays, the plaintiffs here have not been personally subjected to a\n\nracial classification; hence, they cannot claim a stigmatic equal protection injury under Shaw.\n\nBut that does not defeat standing, because this Court's conclusion that plaintiffs have standing to\n\nbring this challenge rests on an entirely different conception of their injury. Plaintiffs' injury is\n\nnot that they are subjected to a racial classification that creates either concrete or stigmatic\n\nharms, but that a law that allegedly violates equal protection principles denied them the benefit\n\nof the nonpartisan voting referendum. While this is not a \"personal[] deni[al] [of] equal\n\ntreatment,\" Hays, 515 U.S. at 744 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), as would be\n\nrequired for a plaintiff bringing a Shaw claim, it is a concrete, particularized injury, and that is\n\nwhat is required under the Supreme Court's standing jurisprudence. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\n\n       Plaintiffs have also offered another, wholly different standing analysis for Count II.\n\nBecause plaintiffs' alternative argument would establish standing to bring their subsection (c)\n\nclaim, which they do not otherwise have, the Court must consider that argument as well. Citing\n\nNortheastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America v. City of\n\nJacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), plaintiffs argue that their injury-in-fact is \"the denial of equal\n\ntreatment that exists because election changes supported by Plaintiffs and other non-minorities in\n\nKinston cannot become law without satisfying those amendments' minority-preferences.\" Plfs.'\n\nOpp. at 35.

The plaintiff was an\n\norganization of business owners, most of whose businesses did not qualify for the 5% set-aside.\n\nId. at 658. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the organization lacked standing because it\n\ncould not point to specific contracts its members would have been awarded in the absence of the\n\nset-aside program. Id. at 660. The Supreme Court disagreed:\n\n       When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of\n       one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member\n       of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would\n       have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing. The\n       \"injury in fact\" in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal\n       treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to\n       obtain the benefit.\n\nId. at 666. The Supreme Court identified the core equal protection injury as \"the inability to\n\ncompete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract.\" Id. Here,\n\nplaintiffs allege that the 2006 amendments to Section 5 function as a \"discriminatory barrier\"\n\nthat prevents them from competing equally with minorities in the advancement of \"beneficial\n\nlocal laws\" like the referendum. Plfs.' Opp. at 37. They contend that it is therefore irrelevant\n\nwhether they would have obtained the benefit -- enactment of the referendum -- but for the\n\ndiscriminatory barrier.\n\n       But one difference between this case and Jacksonville is immediately apparent. In\n\nJacksonville, it was \"more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it [wa]s for\n\nmembers of another group.\" Id. at 666. That is, a white business owner in Jacksonville could\n\ncompete for only 95% of the city contract dollars, while a minority business owner could\n\n\n\n                                                77\n\fcompete for 100% of those dollars. Id. at 658-61. Therefore, white business owners were\n\ntreated differently than were black business owners in Jacksonville solely because of the color of\n\ntheir skin. That is not at all true here, because white supporters of the nonpartisan referendum\n\nare in exactly the same position as black supporters of the referendum. The Justice Department's\n\npreclearance letter focused solely on the referendum's ultimate effects, not on whether white or\n\nblack citizens proposed and supported it.8 Plaintiffs do not claim that the Justice Department\n\nrelied on their race at any point in the decision whether to preclear the referendum; indeed, all\n\nindications are that the Attorney General would have made the same decision if plaintiffs were\n\nminorities. A black Republican or nonpartisan candidate who stood to benefit from the\n\nreferendum would be precisely as frustrated as Nix is.\n\n       Plaintiffs' argument that white voters have standing to challenge the amendments because\n\nthe Voting Rights Act was meant to benefit minorities is unpersuasive. See Mot. Hr'g Tr.\n\n[Docket Entry 66] 22:18-23, 23:3-11, Oct. 26, 2011. The Supreme Court made clear in Shaw I\n\nthat both white voters and minority voters could bring a claim of a racial classification injury\n\ncaused by the operation of the Voting Rights Act. Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 652 (holding that \"white\n\nvoters . . . or voters of any other race\" could bring claim of stigmatic equal protection injury).\n\nWhether the Voting Rights Act and Section 5 were intended to benefit white or minority voters\n\nwas irrelevant. That question is similarly irrelevant here.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          Ironically, that statement might not be true if the Ashcroft standard were still in place.\nWhen the Justice Department applied Ashcroft to evaluate the switch from nonpartisan to\npartisan elections in the Charleston County School Board, the Department did consider how\nblack representatives and other community members viewed the proposed change. See Letter\nfrom R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant Attorney General, to C. Havird Jones, Jr., Senior Assistant\nAttorney General (Feb. 26, 2004).\n\n                                                 78\n\f        Unlike the Jacksonville plaintiff, the plaintiffs here have not shown that the government\n\nclassified them based on the color of their skin. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 666; see also Townes,\n\n577 F.3d at 546, 548, 550-51 (allowing black habeas petitioner to rely on Jacksonville for\n\nstanding because he alleged that white inmate had been treated differently). And unlike the\n\nShaw I plaintiffs, they do not claim any stigmatic injury. Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 652. The only\n\nconcrete way in which the amendments injured plaintiffs was in suspending the referendum, and,\n\nas explained, only subsections (b) and (d) caused that injury. The Court therefore concludes\n\nagain that plaintiffs lack standing to bring their challenge to subsection (c). Nonetheless, for the\n\nreasons explained earlier, the Court will proceed to set forth how it would analyze plaintiffs'\n\nCount II claim as to subsection (c) if plaintiffs had standing to pursue that claim.\n\n                                      B. Standard of Review\n\n        The baseline standard of review in racial classification cases is well established: racial\n\nclassifications, whether employed by the federal government or a state or local government, are\n\nreviewed under strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (1995).\n\nAlthough there are two reasons that principle might not apply here, the Court concludes that it\n\nshould apply strict scrutiny to plaintiffs' claims.\n\n        The first reason that strict scrutiny might not apply is that the amendments to Section 5\n\nare, on their face, race-neutral. They provide only that no voting changes that \"ha[ve] the\n\npurpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States\n\non account of race or color . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice\" can be precleared.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b). Unlike, say, a set-aside for businesses owned by minorities, the\n\namendments make no textual distinction between white and minority voters. Still, it is clear\n\n\n\n                                                  79\n\fbeyond peradventure that the purpose of Section 5 and the 2006 amendments is to protect\n\nminority voting rights, and that they are applied to do so. See Def.'s Opp. at 12 (\"In any event, it\n\nhas been clear since at least 1976 . . . that Section 5 is not race-neutral.\"). Laws \"neutral on their\n\nface but 'unexplainable on grounds other than race'\" are analyzed under strict scrutiny. Miller,\n\n515 U.S. at 905 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266). That principle governs here.\n\n       The second reason strict scrutiny might not apply is that, as the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized, voting regulations -- particularly in the context of districting -- are different than\n\nother government actions. While most government actions should be wholly colorblind, a\n\nlegislature \"always is aware of race when it draws district lines, just as it is aware of age,\n\neconomic status, religious and political persuasion, and a variety of other demographic factors.\"\n\nShaw I, 509 U.S. at 646. Hence, districting based in part on governmental \"aware[ness] of race\"\n\nis not always reviewed under strict scrutiny. See id. The Supreme Court's caselaw on how far\n\nthis principle extends is extremely fractured. Some members of the Court have endorsed the\n\nproposition that intentional creation of majority-minority districts is a form of mere racial\n\nawareness, not racial classification, while others have disagreed or refused to take a position on\n\nthat question. See Vera, 517 U.S. at 958 (plurality opinion) (intentional creation of majority-\n\nminority districts can be mere racial awareness that does not require strict scrutiny); id. at 996\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (declining to take a position); id. at 999 (Thomas and Scalia, JJ.,\n\nconcurring in judgment) (finding that strict scrutiny applies to all intentional creation of\n\nmajority-minority districts); id. at 1003-04 (Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., dissenting)\n\n(finding that strict scrutiny did not apply to majority-minority districts before the Court); id. at\n\n\n\n\n                                                  80\n\f1045-46 (Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., dissenting) (rejecting Shaw I's strict scrutiny\n\nframework).\n\n        It might be possible to describe Section 5 and the 2006 amendments as mere federal\n\n\"awareness\" of how race functions in the context of voting laws. If intentional creation of\n\nmajority-minority districts is sometimes a function of racial awareness rather than racial\n\nclassification, then Section 5 -- a law that creates certain rules and limitations for districting and\n\nother voting regulations -- may be as well. As explained, the Supreme Court's caselaw on when\n\nstrict scrutiny applies to state action in drawing districts is severely splintered, and it is unclear\n\nwhether it would apply at all in the context of the federal government's enactment of Section 5.\n\nBecause translating the Shaw/Vera caselaw into this context is so unwieldy, the Court will\n\npresume that the usual equal protection principles apply rather than the unique exception in the\n\ndistricting context. Accordingly, the Court will apply strict scrutiny to plaintiffs' equal\n\nprotection challenge. Hence, the government must show that the use of race in the 2006\n\namendments is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve a \"compelling\" government interest.

Subsection (c)\n\n        The constitutionality of subsection (c) is largely resolved by the Court's discussion of\n\nsubsection (c) with respect to Count I. As explained there, all that Congress has forbidden in\n\nsubsection (c) is purposefully discriminatory actions that dilute the voting power of minorities.\n\nAs this simply repeats the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment, it cannot also violate the\n\nEqual Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. Washington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239-\n\n\n\n                                                   81\n\f41 (1976) (explaining that intentional discrimination by government actors violates the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (explaining that\n\n\"[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       Here, as in Count I, plaintiffs' real concern is that the Department of Justice will use\n\nsubsection (c) as a sword rather than a shield. But the Supreme Court made clear in Miller and\n\nShaw II that doing so would be unlawful. Miller, 515 U.S. at 924-25; Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 911-\n\n13. Plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence that the Department of Justice has employed the\n\n\"purpose\" prong inappropriately after the 1990s round of districting, and the Court will not\n\npresume that the Department will violate the law. See Tilton v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108381\"><a href=\"/opinion/108381/tilton-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 679\n\n(1971). If that presumption proves wrong, an as-applied challenge may be brought in the\n\nappropriate case.\n\n       2. Subsections (b) and (d)\n\n       There are two reasons that the amendments in subsections (b) and (d) could raise equal\n\nprotection concerns. First, there is the possibility that the amendments function as a \"facial\n\nquota-preference for minorities,\" as plaintiffs put it. Plfs.' Opp. at 24. As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained in other contexts, quotas and rigid minority-preference schemes violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause. See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258, 269 n.18, 271-72 (2003)\n\n(citing Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.

A plurality of the\n\nSupreme Court raised this possibility in a discussion of the necessary prerequisites for bringing a\n\n\n\n                                                82\n\fSection 2 claim in LULAC, where plaintiffs brought a Section 2 claim in response to a\n\nredistricting plan that, among other things, redrew what had been an African-American influence\n\ndistrict. 548 U.S. at 445-46. Writing for three members of the Court, Justice Kennedy explained\n\nthat the fact \"[t]hat African-Americans had influence in the district does not suffice to state a § 2\n\nclaim in these cases. . . . If § 2 were interpreted to protect this kind of influence, it would\n\nunnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional\n\nquestions.\" Id. (citing Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 491 (Kennedy, J., concurring)). Justice Kennedy\n\nhad expressed similar concerns in his separate concurrence in Ashcroft:\n\n        As is evident from the Court's accurate description of the facts in this case, race\n        was a predominant factor in drawing the lines of Georgia's State Senate\n        redistricting map. If the Court's statement of facts had been written as the preface\n        to consideration of a challenge brought under the Equal Protection Clause or\n        under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a reader of the opinion would have\n        had sound reason to conclude that the challenge would succeed. Race cannot be\n        the predominant factor in redistricting under our decision in Miller v. Johnson,\n        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). Yet considerations of race that would doom a redistricting\n        plan under the Fourteenth Amendment or § 2 seem to be what save it under § 5.\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. at 491 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Although neither Justice Kennedy's\n\nconcurrence nor the plurality decision in LULAC spelled out the details of the equal protection\n\nissue, the concern appears to be that excessive consideration of race by the federal government\n\nmay cause the sort of stigmatic harms discussed in Shaw I and Miller.\n\n        In evaluating whether subsections (b) and (d) violate equal protection principles, a key\n\npoint to keep in mind is the narrowness of plaintiffs' challenge. Count II challenges only the\n\n2006 amendments to Section 5. It does not argue that the entire non-retrogression principle is\n\ninvalid, only that Ashcroft's refinement of that principle is constitutionally indispensable. See\n\nLaRoque II, 650 F.3d at 794 (\"Significantly, plaintiffs do not contest the constitutionality of the\n\n\n\n                                                  83\n\fpre-2006 preclearance standards articulated in Georgia v. Ashcroft and Bossier Parish.\"). That\n\nis, plaintiffs contend that the retrogression principle complies with the equal protection\n\ncomponent of the Fifth Amendment only if, as Ashcroft decreed, (1) states may trade influence\n\ndistricts for opportunity districts and (2) courts and the Justice Department can take into account\n\nother jurisdiction-specific factors, such as minority-preferred legislators' views of proposed\n\nvoting changes, in making preclearance decisions. While plaintiffs' briefing on this argument is\n\ncursory, see Plfs.' MSJ at 44-45, their argument is presumably that the Ashcroft standard is a\n\nnarrowly tailored response to the government's compelling interest, but that subsections (b) and\n\n(d) are not.\n\n        Given that plaintiffs do not challenge the general retrogression principle, they may have\n\nconceded that the government indeed has a compelling interest in remedying discrimination in\n\nvoting. But even if plaintiffs do not concede that point, the Court would conclude that Congress\n\ndoes in fact have such a compelling interest. Congress has identified historical and ongoing\n\nintentional discrimination that strikes at the heart of two of the most important rights protected\n\nby the Constitution -- the right to vote and the right to be free from governmental discrimination\n\nbased on race. Congress heard testimony in 2005 and 2006 that intentionally dilutive techniques\n\nhave been used as long as minorities have been able to vote. Witness testimony and other record\n\nevidence indicated that discriminatory, dilutive efforts are ongoing in covered jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover, Congress received evidence that such efforts would increase in the absence of Section\n\n5's deterrent effect.\n\n        The Supreme Court has recognized that \"remedying the effects of past intentional\n\ndiscrimination\" can be a compelling interest. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 720 (citing Freeman\n\n\n\n                                                 84\n\fv.

All things being equal, with no history of\n       discrimination, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their\n       homes. But all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately\n       constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation. The remedy for such\n       segregation may be administratively awkward, inconvenient, and even bizarre in\n       some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and\n       inconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments\n       are being made to eliminate the dual school systems.\n\nId. at 28. The Court also noted that facially \"'racially neutral' assignment plans proposed by\n\nschool authorities . . . may be inadequate\" to remedy the problems caused by past segregation.\n\nId. These observations assist the analysis in the voting rights context.\n\n       The Supreme Court has also held that racial classifications can be used to remedy past\n\ndiscrimination outside the school desegregation context. In United States v. Paradise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163, 166 (1987), for example, every member of the Court agreed that racial classifications\n\ncould sometimes be used to remedy past discrimination, and a majority of the Court approved a\n\nrule that a state agency that had systematically excluded blacks from promotion had to award\n\n50% of promotions to qualified black candidates until the agency developed an acceptable\n\nalternative plan. In Adarand v.

Mere invocation of the word \"remedial\" cannot justify\n\nany use of racial classifications that the government desires. See Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at\n\n720-21. For instance, a school district that has never imposed de jure segregation, or that has\n\nachieved unitary status, cannot invoke remedial justifications for classifying students by race.\n\nId. Moreover, as Swann recognized, \"there are limits\" to the use of racial classifications even to\n\nremedy de jure segregation. 402 U.S. at 28. The Swann Court explained that if \"we were to read\n\nthe holding of the District Court [mandating certain actions to desegregate schools] to require, as\n\na matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that\n\napproach would be disapproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" Id. Justice Kennedy,\n\nconcurring in Parents Involved, repeated the same points: \"The Court has allowed school\n\ndistricts to remedy their prior de jure segregation by classifying individual students based on\n\ntheir race. . . . The remedy, though, was limited in time and limited to the wrong.\" 551 U.S. at\n\n796 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n       The Supreme Court has also ensured that remedial race-conscious measures are closely\n\ntied to the harms caused by discrimination by requiring express findings of official\n\ndiscrimination before allowing state and local governments to use race-conscious remedies. See,\n\ne.g., City of Richmond v. J.A.

The Supreme\n\nCourt has also suggested, however, that Congress is not obliged to make such findings, as state\n\nand local governments are, because the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments enlarge its power\n\nrather than restricting it. See J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 490; but see Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n\n224, 226-31; see also id. at 264-65 (Souter, J., dissenting). Justice Scalia, concurring in J.A.\n\nCroson Co., elaborated on that point: \"[I]t is one thing to permit racially based conduct by the\n\nFederal Government -- whose legislative powers on their face were explicitly enhanced by the\n\nFourteenth Amendment -- and quite another to permit it by the precise entities against whose\n\nconduct in matters of race that Amendment was specifically directed.\" Id. at 521-22 (internal\n\ncitations omitted). Justice Scalia also pointed out that \"a sound distinction between federal and\n\nstate (or local) action based upon race rests not only upon the substance of the Civil War\n\nAmendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory,\" because \"[t]he struggle for\n\nracial justice has historically been a struggle by the national society against oppression in the\n\nindividual States . . . . And the struggle retains that character in modern times.\" Id. at 522.\n\n       Even under the limitations the Supreme Court has imposed on the remedial use of race,\n\nthe Court concludes that Congress has a compelling interest here in remedying prior state- and\n\nlocal government-sponsored racial discrimination -- and, even more importantly, in preventing\n\nthe ongoing discriminatory efforts Congress identified. Intentional vote dilution, like school\n\n\n\n                                                  87\n\fsegregation, is one of the most pernicious forms of de jure discrimination against minorities, and\n\nCongress is entitled to remedy any \"harm that is traceable to\" that intentional discrimination.\n\nParents Involved, 551 U.S. at 721. Identifying the harm \"traceable to\" discrimination is, of\n\ncourse, more complicated in the voting context than in the de jure school segregation context, as\n\njurisdictions do not generally openly announce voting discrimination in the same way that school\n\nsegregation was announced. But Congress compiled an extensive legislative record that tied the\n\nremedies to areas of de jure discrimination in voting; it also relied on past legislative records\n\nfinding intentional discrimination in covered jurisdictions. In doing so, Congress exercised its\n\n\"special competence . . . to make findings with respect to the effects of identified past\n\ndiscrimination\" and its latitude \"to take appropriate remedial measures.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 302\n\nn.41.\n\n        \"All things being equal, with no history of discrimination,\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 28,\n\nCongress would have no interest in such supervision of state voting procedures. \"But all things\n\nare not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial\n\nsegregation.\" Id. In light of the extensive record compiled by Congress in 2005 and 2006, the\n\nCourt finds that Congress has a compelling interest in crafting a remedy to address past and\n\nongoing discrimination in voting.\n\n        The remaining question is whether the amendments contained in subsections (b) and (d)\n\nare sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieving Congress's interests without unnecessary reliance\n\non racial classifications. It bears repeating that plaintiffs have not challenged Ashcroft's\n\ninterpretation of the retrogression standard, so the question before the Court is whether the\n\nmodification of the Ashcroft standard in subsections (b) and (d) -- eliminating consideration of\n\n\n\n                                                 88\n\finfluence districts and other factors unrelated to minorities' \"ability to elect\" -- dooms the\n\namendments on narrow tailoring grounds. The Court finds that it does not. Plaintiffs' primary\n\ncomplaint is that the amendments create an inflexible quota, but the Court is not persuaded that\n\nsubsections (b) and (d) make the Section 5 analysis less flexible. It is true that states can no\n\nlonger substitute influence districts for opportunity districts, but there is no longer any concern\n\nthat influence districts will be protected from retrogression and frozen in place. See LULAC,\n\n548 U.S. at 446; see also, e.g., Senate Hearing, 109th Cong. 56, 101(May 16, 2006) (witnesses\n\nagreeing that influence districts need not be protected from retrogression under the new\n\nstandard); Thernstrom, Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 5 GEO. J.L. & PUB. POL'Y at 71.\n\n       Even if the amendments do make Section 5 less flexible, they still do not create the facial\n\nquota of which plaintiffs complain. As defendant points out, subsections (b) and (d) did not\n\noverturn the prior Section 5 caselaw that provided that there could not be an \"utterly inflexible\n\nprohibition on retrogression.\" Def.'s Opp. at 39 (citing City of Richmond v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109297\"><a href=\"/opinion/109297/richmond-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370-72 (1975)). Even before Ashcroft, the Department had stated that it did not\n\n\"require the reflexive imposition of objections in total disregard of the circumstances involved or\n\nthe legitimate justifications in support of changes that incidentally may be less favorable to\n\nminority voters.\" Revision of Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 of the Voting\n\nRights Act of 1965, 52 Fed. Reg. 486, 488 (Jan. 6, 1987)). In its current regulations, the Justice\n\nDepartment has similarly acknowledged that it must consider \"the extent to which a reasonable\n\nand legitimate justification for the change exists.\" 28 C.F.R. § 51.57(a). Recent guidelines\n\nissued by the Department state that retrogression may be \"unavoidable\" due to \"shifts in\n\npopulation or other significant changes since the last redistricting (e.g., residential segregation\n\n\n\n                                                 89\n\fand demographic distribution of the population within the jurisdiction, the physical geography of\n\nthe jurisdiction, the jurisdiction's historical redistricting practices, political boundaries, such as\n\ncities or counties, and/or state redistricting requirements).\" Guidance Concerning Redistricting\n\nUnder Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7470, at 7472 (Feb. 9, 2011). In such\n\nsituations, retrogressive plans may be precleared when the jurisdiction demonstrates that \"a\n\nless-retrogressive plan cannot reasonably be drawn.\" Id. Finally, retrogressive plans must be\n\nprecleared when avoiding retrogression would require a district to violate Shaw I and Miller. Id.\n\nHence, whatever race-consciousness is mandated by subsections (b) and (d) resembles the\n\nflexible mathematical ratios approved in Swann more than it resembles an inflexible quota. See\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 25. Certainly, the standard laid out in subsections (b) and (d) is more\n\nflexible than the 50% promotion rule approved in Paradise. See 480 U.S. at 163-64.\n\n        Statutes may be invalidated on tailoring grounds when the challengers can suggest a\n\nnarrower alternative that would be successful in curing the identified problem. See United States\n\nv. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118369\"><a href=\"/opinion/118369/united-states-v-playboy-entertainment-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813 (2000). Other than pointing to the Ashcroft\n\nstandard, plaintiffs here have not attempted to do so. But Congress justifiably decided that\n\nAshcroft's interpretation of the effects prong would not remedy the problems of intentional vote\n\ndilution that it identified. As the record before Congress confirmed, Ashcroft gave jurisdictions\n\ngreater leeway to disguise intentional discrimination and it created significant administrability,\n\nsubjectivity, and partisanship problems. Hence, Ashcroft -- whether it was more or less narrow\n\nthan subsections (b) and (d) -- was not \"tailored\" to achieve Congress's ends. Plaintiffs' failure to\n\noffer hypothetical alternative amendments that would cure the Ashcroft problems but be\n\nnarrower than (b) and (d) may reflect the difficulty of imagining what such amendments would\n\n\n\n                                                   90\n\fbe. As previously explained, the 2006 amendments respond to specific problems in the Ashcroft\n\nholding in a relatively discrete way, so there is not much ground between the Ashcroft standard\n\nthat is acceptable to plaintiffs and the amendments that they challenge. The Court therefore\n\nfinds that the 2006 amendments in subsections (b) and (d) are narrowly tailored to respond to the\n\nhistorical and ongoing problems of voting discrimination identified by Congress.\n\n       As to the second basis for an equal protection challenge -- that race is \"infuse[d] . . . into\n\nvirtually every redistricting,\" LULAC, 548 U.S. at 446 -- the amendments are actually an\n\nimprovement over the Ashcroft standard. Under Ashcroft, states might have had to protect\n\ninfluence districts from retrogression in the same way that opportunity districts were protected.\n\nSection 5's non-retrogression principle would thus have come into play in every influence district\n\nas well as every opportunity district. Given how many districts could conceivably be defined as\n\ninfluence districts, race could truly have been infused into \"virtually every redistricting.\"\n\nMoreover, under the Ashcroft standard, the Justice Department would have had to obtain the\n\nviews of minority voters and minority-preferred candidates on any proposed election change -- a\n\nconsiderably broader and more unwieldy undertaking than the purpose or effects test, and one\n\nthat would have required an even more racially-inflected view of elections. See supra note 8\n\n(citing Letter from R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant Attorney General, to C. Havird Jones, Jr.,\n\nSenior Assistant Attorney General (Feb. 26, 2004)).\n\n       For the reasons previously explained, the Court does not believe that an explicitly racial\n\nproblem can be resolved with no reference to race. To that extent, then, race must be infused\n\ninto at least some redistricting processes for the duration of the amended Section 5. Cf. Swann,\n\n402 U.S. at 28 (remedying de jure segregation may be \"administratively awkward, inconvenient,\n\n\n\n                                                 91\n\fand even bizarre in some situations and may impose burdens on some; but all awkwardness and\n\ninconvenience cannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial adjustments are being\n\nmade to eliminate\" the vestiges of segregation). But Congress restricted the scope of the racial\n\ninquiry when it enacted the 2006 amendments contained in subsection (b) and (d), while at the\n\nsame time tailoring the amendments to respond as effectively as possible to the problems of\n\nracial discrimination in voting. The Court finds that doing so was not a violation of equal\n\nprotection.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       This Court explained in Shelby County that Congress, the \"coequal and representative\n\nbranch of our Government,\" has the preeminent constitutional role under the Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments in determining the legislation needed to enforce those Amendments'\n\nguarantees.

Austin II, 129 S.

See 152 Cong. Rec. S8012 (daily ed. July 20,\n\n2006); 152 Cong. Rec. H5143-5207 (daily ed. July 13, 2006). And, as the Court found with\n\nrespect to the challenge to the reauthorization of the preclearance regime as a whole, Congress\n\ncarefully and extensively justified its decisions to amend the statute to overturn or modify two\n\nSupreme Court decisions interpreting Section 5. This Court declines to overturn that careful,\n\nwell-supported judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                92\n\f       For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment,\n\nand grant the motions for summary judgment filed by the Attorney General and the defendant-\n\nintervenors.
