BATCHELDER, Chief Judge. In 1992, a Tennessee jury convicted\nPetitioner-Appellant Henry Hodges of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\fNo. 09-5021       Hodges v. Colson                                                 Page 2\n\n\nThe state courts upheld the conviction and sentence on appeal and denied Hodges’s\npetition for post-conviction relief. Hodges then petitioned for federal habeas relief,\nwhich the district court denied. Hodges now appeals that denial to this court. For the\nfollowing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Hodges’s habeas petition.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the facts of this case as follows:\n\n       The defendant, Henry Eugene Hodges, entered a guilty plea and was\n       convicted of premeditated first-degree murder. Thereafter, the penalty\n       phase of the trial commenced. The State presented proof of the\n       circumstances of the offense through the testimony of Trina Brown, the\n       defendant’s fifteen-year-old girlfriend. Brown testified that one week\n       before the murder she and the twenty-four-year-old defendant, who were\n       living with the defendant’s brother in Smyrna, Tennessee, decided to\n       move to Florida. To get money for the move, Hodges, a male\n       homosexual prostitute, told Brown that he would rob and kill the next\n       person who propositioned him. Hodges discussed with Brown how the\n       crimes would be carried out. Hodges repeated these statements on May\n       14, 1990, the day of this murder.\n       On the night of May 14, Brown and Hodges went to Centennial Park in\n       Nashville. When the victim, Ronald Bassett, approached, Hodges talked\n       with him, and they left together in the victim’s vehicle and went to the\n       victim’s residence at 3133A, Parthenon Avenue, across from Centennial\n       Park. Ten or fifteen minutes later, Hodges returned to the park on foot,\n       and along with Brown, drove back to the victim’s residence in his own\n       car. Hodges told Brown to lie down in the backseat of the car so no one\n       could see her. When they arrived at the victim’s residence, Hodges told\n       Brown to wait in the car. After an unspecified period of time, Hodges\n       returned to the car, wearing gloves, and asked Brown to come into the\n       house. Brown testified that when she arrived, Bassett was lying face\n       down on the bed in his bedroom with a pillow over his head. Hodges had\n       bound his feet together with duct tape and had handcuffed his hands.\n       While Bassett lay helplessly, Brown and the defendant ransacked the\n       house searching for items of value. After obtaining the personal\n       identification number for the victim’s automatic teller card, Brown and\n       the defendant “took a break,” drank a coke, and discussed whether to kill\n       Bassett. Brown testified that she told Hodges to kill Bassett to prevent\n       their arrest. Hodges then went into the bedroom and, ignoring the\n       victim’s pleas not to kill him, strangled Bassett to death with a nylon\n\fNo. 09-5021      Hodges v. Colson                                                   Page 3\n\n\n      rope. Brown testified that she heard Bassett moan and make a choking\n      sound and that it took about five minutes for Bassett to die.\n      In an attempt to remove any fingerprints, the defendant wiped off various\n      items in the residence. After turning the air conditioner in Bassett’s\n      bedroom on high to prevent discovery of the body, Hodges and Brown\n      left the victim’s residence, taking the victim’s automobile and several\n      items of personal property, including jewelry, a gun, and a VCR. After\n      using Bassett’s automatic teller card to withdraw the twenty-four-hour\n      maximum of four hundred dollars from his account, the pair returned to\n      the house of the defendant’s brother and went to bed. The next day,\n      having learned that the victim’s body had been discovered, Brown and\n      the defendant abandoned the victim’s car in rural Rutherford County and\n      drove to Georgia in their own car. They were eventually arrested in\n      North Carolina. Items of the victim’s personal property were found in\n      their possession at this time. Also, the defendant’s fingerprints were\n      found on items inside Bassett’s home, and Brown had been photographed\n      withdrawing money with Bassett’s automatic teller card.\n      Testifying for the State at the sentencing hearing, Dr. Charles Harlan, the\n      chief medical examiner for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson\n      County, confirmed that Bassett had died from ligature strangulation. Dr.\n      Harlan opined that Bassett would have remained alive and conscious for\n      at least three and perhaps as long as five minutes during the\n      strangulation. Harlan also found abrasions on the victim’s wrists\n      consistent with handcuffs.\n      The State proved that the defendant had been convicted of armed\n      robbery, attempted kidnaping and robbery in Hamilton County in 1984.\n      The State also established that the defendant had been convicted of\n      murder in Fulton County, Georgia, in July 1990. The record reveals that\n      the Georgia killing occurred when the defendant and Brown arrived in\n      Atlanta after murdering Bassett. Hodges made arrangements with a man\n      to engage in homosexual acts for an agreed price. Hodges accompanied\n      the man to his motel room, but when the man was unable to pay the\n      agreed price, Hodges murdered him.\n      In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of\n      his mother, his brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist.\n      This proof showed that the defendant was the next to youngest of his\n      mother’s five sons. His mother and father were not married. His father\n      was actually married to another woman, but engaged in what one of the\n      witnesses described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother\n      for eighteen years. The defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother\n      and was strict with the defendant’s brothers, three of whom were the\n      children of another man. The defendant, however, was his father’s\n\fNo. 09-5021      Hodges v. Colson                                                  Page 4\n\n\n      favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties forced the family to move\n      about frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family only\n      sporadically.\n      The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until\n      he was twelve years old. At that time, he began to associate with older\n      boys, sniff glue and gasoline, be truant from school, and run away from\n      home. He also engaged in sexual activities with his younger brother and\n      attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He became involved\n      with the juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in\n      Chattanooga.\n      Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that\n      a catalyst and major contributing cause of his delinquent and later\n      criminal behavior was his rape and sexual abuse by a stranger when he\n      was twelve years old. According to the defendant, he accepted a\n      stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from\n      his home on Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges\n      home, the stranger drove Hodges to his home and raped him. Fearing\n      rejection by his homophobic father and driven by guilt, the defendant\n      told no one of this incident until he was arrested in 1990.\n      Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an\n      antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and substance\n      (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated by a subconscious desire for\n      revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was twelve,\n      coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was\n      engaged in homosexual prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic]\n      sister-in-law shortly before the killing that he was a homosexual\n      prostitute. The defense also introduced testimony that Brown dominated\n      and manipulated the defendant.\n      In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and\n      Dr. Leonard Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the\n      defendant and concluded that he suffered from an antisocial personality\n      disorder. They described persons with this disorder as having “no\n      conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest and\n      untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and\n      . . . willing to use any means to get what they want, no matter who it\n      hurts.” While acknowledging the complicated factors involved in\n      antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts discounted the\n      singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in\n      causing the defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the\n      defendant “was in complete control of his behavior” and not suffering\n      from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                                    Page 5\n\n\n       Based on the evidence presented, the jury determined that the State had\n       proven the existence of three aggravating circumstances beyond a\n       reasonable doubt: (1) “[t]he defendant was previously convicted of one\n       or more felonies, other than the present charge whose statutory elements\n       involve the use of violence to the person;” (2) “[t]he murder was\n       especially heinous, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or serious\n       physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death;” and (3) “[t]he\n       murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in committing,\n       or was an accomplice in the commission of, or attempting to\n       commit, or fleeing after committing a robbery.” Tenn. Code Ann.\n       § 39–13–204(i)(2); (i)(5) and (i)(7) (1991 Repl.). In addition, the jury\n       found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating\n       circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and, as a result, sentenced the\n       defendant to death by electrocution. The trial court entered a judgment\n       in accordance with the jury’s verdict and the Court of Criminal Appeals\n       affirmed. After reviewing the record and considering the errors alleged\n       by the defendant, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and Court of\n       Criminal Appeals.\n\nTennessee v. Hodges, 944 S.W.2d 346, 349–51 (Tenn. 1997) (footnotes omitted).\n\n                             PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Hodges was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in January\n1992. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence\nin 1995. Tennessee v. Hodges, No. 01-C-01-9212-CR00382, 1995 WL 301443 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. May 18, 1995). The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed in 1997. Hodges,\n944 S.W.2d 346.\n\n       Hodges filed a petition for post-conviction relief in December 1997, and the trial\ncourt denied relief in February 1999. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\naffirmed that decision in 2000. Hodges v. Tennessee, No. M1999-00516-CCA-R3-PD,\n2000 WL 1562865 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 20, 2000). The Tennessee Supreme Court\ndenied an application for permission to appeal in March 2001.\n\n       Hodges filed a petition to proceed in forma pauperis in federal district court in\nMay 2001, a provisional petition for a writ of habeas corpus in July 2001, and an\namended petition in March 2002. Hodges raised 32 claims and subclaims in his\namended habeas petition. The district court granted some of Hodges’s discovery\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 6\n\n\nrequests, denied others, and denied Hodges’s request for an evidentiary hearing. In\nMarch 2008, the district court denied Hodges’s habeas petition. Hodges applied for a\nCertificate of Appealability (“COA”), and the district court granted a COA as to all\nclaims.\n\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          This court reviews de novo a district court’s legal conclusions and mixed\nquestions of law and fact, and reviews its factual findings for clear error. Lucas v.\nO’Dea, 179 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir. 1999). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act (“AEDPA”), a district court may not grant a habeas petition with respect to\nany claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state courts unless the adjudication\nresulted in a decision that: (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based\non an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the\nstate courts. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Under the “contrary to” clause, a federal habeas court\nmay grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by\nthe Supreme Court on a question of law, or if the state court decides a case differently\nthan the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412–13 (2000). Under the “unreasonable application” clause, a\nfederal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing\nlegal principle from the Supreme Court’s decisions but unreasonably applies that\nprinciple to the facts of the petitioner’s case. Id. To obtain habeas relief, “a state\nprisoner must show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in federal\ncourt was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”\nHarrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 786–87 (2011).\n\n          To analyze whether a state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established Supreme Court precedent, courts look only to the\nholdings of the Supreme Court’s decisions as of the time of the relevant state court\ndecision. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 71–72 (2003). Courts consider lower court\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 7\n\n\ndecisions to the extent they shed light on the analysis of Supreme Court holdings to\ndetermine whether a legal principle had been clearly established. Hill v. Hofbauer,\n337 F.3d 706, 716 (6th Cir. 2003). Finally, the state court’s factual findings are\npresumed correct unless rebutted by the habeas petitioner by clear and convincing\nevidence. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); McAdoo v. Elo, 365 F.3d 487, 493–94 (6th Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n         Before this court, Hodges raises four issues: (1) whether the state courts\nreasonably applied federal law in determining that certain restrictions imposed on voir\ndire by the trial court did not interfere with Hodges’s constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial trial; (2) whether the district court properly denied Hodges’s requests for\ndiscovery, an evidentiary hearing, and habeas relief on a claim of juror misconduct;\n(3) whether the state courts reasonably applied federal law in determining that Hodges’s\ntrial counsel were not ineffective for advising Hodges to plead guilty to murder and\naggravated robbery; and (4) whether the district court properly denied an evidentiary\nhearing and habeas relief on Hodges’s claims of incompetency at trial and ineffective\nassistance of counsel at sentencing. Hodges failed to brief the remaining claims for\nwhich the district court granted a COA and, therefore, has waived them. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 28(a)(9)(A); Landrum v. Mitchell, 625 F.3d 905, 913 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\nI.       Restrictions on Voir Dire\n\n         Hodges alleges that he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury when the\ntrial court refused to allow his attorneys to ask prospective jurors whether they could\nconsider a life sentence for a defendant with a prior conviction for murder. Specifically,\ndefense counsel repeatedly attempted to ask the following question or a variation\nthereof: “Could you impose a life sentence for somebody who has been convicted of\nfirst degree murder twice?” The trial court repeatedly sustained the prosecution’s\nobjections to the question.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                                 Page 8\n\n\n       Hodges raised this claim on direct appeal. The Tennessee Court of Criminal\nAppeals rejected it, finding that each juror was asked and allowed to answer questions\nabout whether he could follow the law, consider a life sentence, and weigh the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances. Hodges, 1995 WL 301443, at *8. The court\nalso found that a prospective juror could not answer the question “without knowing more\nabout the facts surrounding the case,” and that the question impermissibly sought “to\nobtain a pledge from the prospective juror.” Id. The district court found that the state\ncourt’s decision was not an unreasonable application of federal law, agreeing with the\nstate appellate court that Hodges’s questions improperly sought to commit the jurors to\nan opinion before hearing all of the evidence.\n\n       The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a trial by an impartial\njury. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 726–27 (1992). An adequate voir dire to identify\nunqualified jurors is integral to that right. Id. at 729; Dennis v. Mitchell, 354 F.3d 511,\n523–24 (6th Cir. 2003). A state court’s refusal to pose “constitutionally compelled”\nquestions merits habeas relief. Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 425–26 (1991).\nQuestions are constitutionally compelled only if “the trial court’s failure to ask these\nquestions . . . render[s] the defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair.” Id.\n\n       Hodges relies primarily on Morgan in support of his position. In Morgan, the\ntrial court did not permit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors the following\nquestion: “If you found [the defendant] guilty, would you automatically vote to impose\nthe death penalty no matter what the facts are?” Morgan, 504 U.S. at 723. The Supreme\nCourt held that general questions about following the law were not enough and that it\nwas error to exclude a more specific question tailored to identify jurors “who would\nalways impose death following conviction [of a capital offense].” Id. at 733, 735\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ determination that the trial court’s\nrestrictions on voir dire were permissible was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable\napplication of federal law. The trial court allowed defense counsel to ask the Morgan\nquestion, i.e., whether there was an aggravating circumstance that would cause her\n\fNo. 09-5021             Hodges v. Colson                                                             Page 9\n\n\nautomatically to impose the death penalty. In fact, the trial court went beyond that and\nalso allowed defense counsel to ask prospective jurors whether they could impose a life\nsentence on a defendant who had a prior conviction for a violent felony.1 Only when\ndefense counsel sought to get even more specific—asking whether a prospective juror\ncould impose a life sentence on a defendant who had a prior first-degree murder\nconviction—did the trial court restrict questioning.\n\n         This circuit has held that voir dire questions about how a potential juror would\nvote if given specific examples of aggravating or mitigating evidence are not\nconstitutionally compelled under Morgan. In Dennis, 354 F.3d at 523, the petitioner\nalleged that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by refusing to permit him to\nask prospective jurors about specific mitigating factors, including age, lack of prior\ncriminal history, and environment. We held that the Ohio Supreme Court’s conclusion\nthat the trial court allowed adequate questioning was “not an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the record” and was not “contrary to United States Supreme Court\nprecedent.” Id. at 525. We noted that the trial court had allowed the petitioner’s counsel\nto ask prospective jurors about mitigating factors in general: whether or not they could\nconsider mitigating factors and return a life sentence; whether they could follow the law;\nand whether any of the jury panel had strong feelings about psychological evidence\nconcerning upbringing, discipline, and lack of discipline. Id. at 524–26.\n\n         Similarly, in Bedford v. Collins, 567 F.3d 225 (6th Cir. 2009), we rejected the\npetitioner’s claim that the trial court improperly limited the scope of voir dire by\nprohibiting counsel from asking questions that sought to elicit prospective jurors’ views\non the petitioner’s specific case. We noted that the trial court “drew the line at questions\n\n\n         1\n            In one instance, defense counsel asked if a prospective juror could consider mitigating evidence\nfor a defendant who had been previously convicted of a violent felony (as opposed to a previous conviction\nfor first-degree murder). The juror answered “[p]robably not” and was subsequently excluded for cause.\nHodges claims the exclusion of this juror “proves the fundamental unfairness of the trial court’s restrictions\n[on voir dire].” Pet.’s Br. at 69. We disagree for at least two reasons. First, the question posed to that\njuror contemplated a conviction for any violent felony, which is different from a question asking about a\nspecific violent felony actually at issue in the trial (e.g., first-degree murder). Second, the trial court’s\nexclusion of that juror on the basis of her answer to that specific question does nothing whatsoever to\nsuggest that the trial court was constitutionally compelled to allow the excluded questions, which focused\non first-degree murder, not violent felonies in general. Accordingly, despite Hodges’s vehement\narguments to the contrary, the exclusion of that juror does not provide compelling support for his position.\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 10\n\n\nthat sought to elicit the jurors’ views on [the petitioner’s] specific case—but many\njudges understandably (and properly) would do the same thing to prevent the lawyers\nfrom previewing their case through voir dire.” Id. at 232 (emphasis added). Ultimately\nwe concluded that the restrictions on voir dire “did not render the process fundamentally\nunfair.    [The restrictions] reflect instead a reasonable effort to enable adequate\nexploration of juror biases (on the one hand) while preventing counsel from extracting\ncommitments from individual jurors as to the way they would vote (on the other).” Id.\n(citing Dennis, 354 F.3d at 523–25).\n\n          Other circuits agree that Morgan does not compel a trial court to allow questions\nabout how a potential juror would vote if given specific examples of aggravating or\nmitigating evidence. See Richmond v. Polk, 375 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2004); United States\nv. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1207 (10th Cir. 1998) (“When a defendant seeks to ask a\njuror to speculate or precommit on how that juror might vote based on any particular\nfacts, the question strays beyond the purpose and protection of Morgan.”). In Richmond,\nthe Fourth Circuit addressed a claim functionally identical to the one presented here by\nHodges. There, the defendant sought to ask potential jurors “if . . . knowing that [the\ndefendant] had a previous first-degree murder conviction, they could still consider\nmitigating circumstances . . . in determining what their ultimate recommendation as to\nlife or death is going to be.” Richmond, 375 F.3d at 316. The trial court denied\ncounsel’s request to ask the question “on the basis that it was a ‘stakeout’ question aimed\nat determining what prospective jurors would do if presented with a certain state of\nevidence.” Id. The North Carolina Supreme Court agreed and affirmed. Id. at 329–30.\nThe Fourth Circuit held that the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision “was neither\ncontrary to nor an unreasonable application of Morgan.” Id. at 330 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It reasoned:\n\n          Morgan does not require that a capital defendant be allowed to determine\n          at voir dire what a prospective juror’s sentencing decision will be if\n          presented with a specific state of evidence or circumstances. Rather,\n          Morgan requires that a capital defendant be afforded an adequate\n          opportunity at voir dire to identify prospective jurors who, even prior to\n          the State’s case in chief, have predetermined to impose the death penalty.\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 11\n\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and formatting omitted).\n\n        We agree with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Richmond, and we hereby\nreaffirm our own holdings in Dennis and Bedford. Trial courts have “a great deal” of\ndiscretion in conducting voir dire. Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729. Morgan simply does not\nrequire a trial court to permit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors how they would\nvote assuming the existence of particular mitigating or aggravating circumstances, which\nis essentially what defense counsel sought to do here.            Morgan allows for the\nidentification and exclusion of jurors who are biased for or against the death penalty\nbefore being presented with any evidence and would always vote in accordance with\ntheir biases without regard to the particular facts of the particular case. Id. at 733 (“Were\nvoir dire not available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner’s challenge for cause\nagainst those prospective jurors who would always impose death following conviction,\nhis right not to be tried by such jurors would be rendered . . . nugatory.”) (emphasis in\noriginal)). When defense counsel asks questions about the specific aggravating and/or\nmitigating factors actually at issue in a case, defense counsel is no longer attempting to\nidentify members of the venire who would always vote for the death penalty; rather,\ndefense counsel is attempting to preview how prospective jurors will vote given the\nspecific facts of the individual case, and Morgan does not require a trial court to allow\nsuch previews.\n\n        Here, defense counsel was permitted to ask the Morgan question and was even\npermitted to go beyond that and ask questions such as whether a juror could impose a\nlife sentence on a defendant with previous violent-felony convictions. That was easily\nsufficient to comply with Morgan’s requirement that a capital defendant be allowed to\nidentify prospective jurors who would “always” vote for death. See id. The trial court\nexcluded only questions concerning specific aggravating factors actually at issue in the\ncase (namely, a previous conviction for first-degree murder). Accordingly, the decision\nof the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirming the trial court’s restrictions on\nvoir dire was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law, and\nHodges is not entitled to habeas relief on this claim.\n\fNo. 09-5021             Hodges v. Colson                                                            Page 12\n\n\nII.      Juror Misconduct\n\n         Hodges claims that his death sentence violates his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights because juror Leroy Thompson engaged in misconduct by allegedly\nmisinforming the trial court that he would be able to sit on the jury but then voting for\nthe death penalty only because he was in pain due to arthritis and wanted to end\ndeliberations. Hodges included Thompson’s alleged misconduct as a ground for his\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing. Hodges concedes that he never raised this matter in\nthe state courts and that it is therefore procedurally defaulted, but he contends that he can\nestablish cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default.\n\n         Whether a petitioner’s federal habeas claim is barred by procedural default is a\nquestion that we review de novo.2 Abela v. Martin, 380 F.3d 915, 922 (6th Cir. 2004).\n“[S]tate prisoners must give the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any\nconstitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State’s established appellate\nreview process.” O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). When a petitioner\nhas failed to present the grounds to the state courts and no state remedy remains\navailable, his grounds are procedurally defaulted. Id. at 847–48. “[T]he exhaustion\ndoctrine requires the petitioner to present the same claim under the same theory to the\nstate courts before raising it on federal habeas review.” Hicks v. Straub, 377 F.3d 538,\n552–53 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner will not be\nallowed to present claims never before presented in the state courts unless he can show\ncause to excuse his failure to present the claims and actual prejudice to his defense at\ntrial or on appeal. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). The only exception\nis if review is needed to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, such as when the\npetitioner submits new evidence showing that a constitutional violation has probably\n\n\n\n         2\n          We recognize that the district court did not discuss whether this claim was procedurally\ndefaulted because it found that Leroy Thompson did not serve on the jury. That finding was clearly\nerroneous; Leroy Thompson’s name appears on the verdict form. The district court’s failure to discuss\nprocedural default of this claim does not prohibit this court from considering it, cf. Elzy v. United States,\n205 F.3d 882, 886 (6th Cir. 2000) (“we nonetheless may raise [the issue of procedural default] sua\nsponte”), particularly in light of the fact that the State argued that the claim was procedurally defaulted in\nboth the district court and in this court.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 13\n\n\nresulted in a conviction of one who is actually innocent. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S.\n478, 495–96 (1986).\n\n       Hodges concedes that he never presented this particular claim to the state courts.\nHe did challenge Thompson for cause on the basis that Thompson was incompetent and\nunable to understand the proceedings, but he never “presente[ed] the same claim under\nthe same theory to the state courts” that he presents here. See Hicks, 377 F.3d at 553.\n\n       Hodges no longer has any state court remedies to exhaust. Under Tennessee’s\npost-conviction law, a prisoner challenging a conviction may file only one petition\nattacking a single judgment. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-102(c). A prisoner may file a\nmotion to reopen his first post-conviction petition only if his claim stems from a newly\nestablished constitutional right that applies retroactively, relies on scientific evidence\nthat he is actually innocent, or involves a sentence enhanced because of a previous\nconviction that has been declared invalid. Fletcher v. Tennessee, 951 S.W.2d 378,\n380–81 (Tenn. 1997) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-217(a) (1996 Supp.)). Hodges’s\njuror misconduct claim does not fall within any of these exceptions. Because he failed\nto present the claim to the state courts and no state court remedies remain available, the\nclaim is procedurally defaulted. See O’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 848.\n\n       At the district court, Hodges argued that various causes could excuse his\nprocedural default, including ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, ineffective\nassistance of post-conviction counsel, reliance on Thompson’s responses in voir dire,\nand Hodges’s inability to locate Thompson before the post-conviction evidentiary\nhearing. Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute cause for a procedural default.\nSee Carrier, 477 U.S. at 492. However, “an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\nasserted as cause for the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally\ndefaulted.” Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 453 (2000). In post-conviction\nproceedings, Hodges raised a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\nregarding Thompson’s competence. He did not claim that appellate counsel were\nineffective for failing to raise the claim that Thompson engaged in misconduct.\n\fNo. 09-5021            Hodges v. Colson                                                            Page 14\n\n\nAccordingly, Hodges cannot rely on ineffective assistance of counsel to establish cause\nto excuse his procedural default.\n\n         Nor can Hodges rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to\nestablish cause to excuse his default, even if this holding is not so clear-cut as it once\nwould have been. Historically, the federal courts have held that there is no constitutional\nright to an attorney in post-conviction proceedings, and that ineffective assistance of\npost-conviction counsel therefore cannot establish cause for procedural default.\nSee Carpenter, 529 U.S. at 450–53; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752; Landrum, 625 F.3d at\n919. But the Supreme Court recently held in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012),\nthat there is a “narrow exception” to Coleman: “Inadequate assistance of counsel at\ninitial review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a procedural default of a\nclaim of ineffective assistance at trial.”                Id. at 1315 (emphasis added).                This\n“equitable”—as opposed to constitutional—exception is premised on Coleman itself, a\ncase in which the Court declined to address the situation in which “state collateral review\nis the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.” Coleman,\n501 U.S. at 755. The Martinez Court held that in such situations ineffective assistance\nof post-conviction counsel may be raised as cause to excuse procedural default because\n“the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s direct appeal\nas to the ineffective assistance claim.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1317.\n\n         The Court in Martinez purported to craft a narrow exception3 to Coleman. We\nwill assume that the Supreme Court meant exactly what it wrote: “Coleman held that\nan attorney’s negligence in a postconviction proceeding does not establish cause, and\nthis remains true except as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel at trial.” Id. at 1316 (emphasis added). The Supreme\nCourt further insisted:\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           We are reminded of one jurist’s statement, made in a different context, that “[e]xceptions to\ncategorical rules, once created, are difficult to cabin; the logic of the new rule, like water, finds its own\nlevel, and it’s hard to keep it from covering far more than anticipated.” United States v. Alvarez, 638 F.3d\n666, 667 (9th Cir. 2011) (Kozinsky, C.J., concurring).\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 15\n\n\n       The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances\n       recognized here. The holding in this case does not concern attorney\n       errors in other kinds of proceedings, including appeals from\n       initial-review collateral proceedings, second or successive collateral\n       proceedings, and petitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate\n       courts. It does not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond\n       the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of\n       ineffective assistance at trial, even though that initial-review collateral\n       proceeding may be deficient for other reasons. In addition, the limited\n       nature of the qualification to Coleman adopted here reflects the\n       importance of the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel and\n       Arizona’s decision to bar defendants from raising ineffective-assistance\n       claims on direct appeal. Our holding here addresses only the\n       constitutional claims presented in this case, where the State barred the\n       defendant from raising the claims on direct appeal.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted; emphases added).\n\n       We will address Hodges’s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a\ndifferent section, but here he claims ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as\ncause to excuse default of his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for\nfailure to raise the juror misconduct issue on direct appeal. Under Martinez’s\nunambiguous holding our previous understanding of Coleman in this regard is still the\nlaw—ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel cannot supply cause for\nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See, e.g.,\nLandrum, 625 F.3d at 919. Moreover, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(i) bars a claim of ineffective\nassistance of post-conviction counsel as a separate ground for relief, see Martinez,\n132 S. Ct. at 1320, and Hodges has not presented any evidence to justify review of his\nclaim in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at\n495–96.\n\n       Additionally, Hodges cannot rely on statements made by Thompson at voir dire\nor difficulties in locating Thompson during state post-conviction proceedings to establish\ncause. Thompson discussed his pain-causing arthritis at voir dire on January 27, 1992.\nThe verdict form is dated January 30, 1992. Hodges filed his petition for state post-\nconviction relief on December 11, 1997. He first attempted to locate Thompson in or\naround June 1998. Hodges gives no explanation whatsoever as to why nearly six-and-a-\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 16\n\n\nhalf years elapsed between his conviction and his first attempt to locate Thompson.\nMoreover, Hodges gives no explanation as to why or how he was able to locate\nThompson for the federal habeas proceeding but not for the state post-conviction\nproceeding.\n\n          “[T]he existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on\nwhether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense\nimpeded counsel’s efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.” Carrier, 477 U.S.\nat 479. For nearly six-and-a-half years, Hodges was aware that Thompson had arthritis\nand may have been in pain during jury deliberations but failed to seek him out. The fact\nthat Hodges did not even attempt to locate Thompson until it was nearly too late, and\nthen could not find him in time to present his testimony to the state court, is not an\nobjective factor external to the defense sufficient to establish cause to excuse procedural\ndefault.\n\n          Finally, Hodges has not presented any evidence that review of this claim is\nnecessary in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See id. at 495–96.\nThis exception has been applied only when a habeas petitioner has demonstrated that he\nis actually innocent. See Carter v. Mitchell, 443 F.3d 517, 538 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing\nCarrier, 477 U.S. at 496). Hodges has not presented new evidence of his innocence nor\nhas he even argued that he is actually innocent.\n\n          Accordingly, Hodges is unable to establish the cause necessary to excuse his\nprocedural default of this claim. It was therefore appropriate for the district court to\ndeny both an evidentiary hearing and habeas relief on this claim because the claim is\nbarred.\n\nIII.      Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Plea Phase\n\n          Hodges argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by advising him\nto plead guilty; that because of their deficient performance, his guilty plea was neither\nknowing, voluntary, nor intelligent; and that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s\nperformance. Hodges claims that his lawyers mistakenly believed that his pleading\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 17\n\n\nguilty would prohibit the state from introducing any evidence relating to the facts of the\nmurder; that his lawyers forgot that if he pled guilty to the aggravated robbery charge,\nHodges would immediately become death eligible; and that he would not have pled\nguilty if his lawyers had given him accurate information.\n\n       Hodges failed to appeal the plea-invalidity claim to the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals, and referred to it only in the final page of his brief without citing to\nthe record or any legal authority. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals considered\nthe issue waived and declined to address it, relying on Tenn. Crim. App. R. 10(b) and\nTenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7). See Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *32. To the extent that\nit is a separate claim, the plea-invalidity claim is procedurally defaulted.\nSee Middlebrooks v. Bell, 619 F.3d 526, 535–36 (6th Cir. 2010). Hodges cannot rely on\nineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to excuse the default; neither has he\npresented any evidence to justify review of his claim in order to prevent a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96. Accordingly, the plea-\ninvalidity claim is barred, and this court will review only the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.\n\n       Hodges raised the ineffective assistance claim in his state post-conviction\npetition. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing and took testimony from Hodges’s\ntrial counsel. Hodges v. Tennessee, No. M1999-00516-CCA-R3-PD, 2000 WL 1562865,\nat *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 20, 2000). The Court of Criminal Appeals summarized\nthe evidence presented as follows:\n\n       At the post-conviction hearing, Dawson [defense counsel at trial]\n       testified that the decision to enter a guilty plea was made the weekend\n       prior to trial when it was determined that “there was no way we were\n       going to convince anybody that Mr. Hodges didn't kill the victim in this\n       matter.” He explained that, at that time, the defense team believed that\n       by entering a plea during the guilt phase of the trial, they would gain\n       credibility with the jury for the sentencing phase. The defense team also\n       hoped to surprise the State by entering the plea. In essence, the defense\n       team intended to disrupt the bifurcated nature of the trial, thereby\n       precluding the State from introducing evidence during the penalty phase\n       which the State had planned to introduce at the guilt phase.\n       Notwithstanding this reasoning, Dawson admitted that, although the\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                            Page 18\n\n\n       proof was overwhelming, in hindsight, they should have proceeded to\n       trial so that they could have begun introduction of their mitigation\n       theories. Michael Terry [defense counsel at trial] corroborated Dawson's\n       testimony regarding the appellant's guilty plea. He explained that the\n       plea was supposed to be “a demonstration of remorse for the jury.”\n       However, he agrees that the decision was a mistake and that they should\n       have at a least “pitched a fight.” [Hodges] did not testify at the\n       post-conviction hearing.\n\nId. The trial court held that counsel made an informed tactical decision to advise Hodges\nto plead guilty. Id.\n\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed that decision. It cited Hill\nv. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985), for the proposition that the two-prong standard from\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), applies to ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims arising out of guilty plea proceedings. Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at\n*19–20. The court concluded that the advice to plead guilty was not “outside the range\nof competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.” Id. at *20. The court noted\nthe overwhelming evidence of guilt, the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency, the\nreasonable belief that the jury would view the guilty plea as an expression of remorse,\nand the elimination of the presentation to the jury of all of the evidence available of\nHodges’s guilt. Id. at *19.\n\n       The district court held that the state court’s conclusion that Hodges’s counsel\nmade a strategic decision to advise him to plead guilty was not unreasonable. The court\nnoted that Hodges’s counsel had done substantial work on the case before advising him\nto plead guilty; that counsel were experienced, aware of the state’s proof and the\nelements of the offenses charged; had the aid of three experts; and were impaired by\nHodges’s public statements admitting to several murders. The district court also found\nthat Hodges did not establish prejudice because Hodges did not testify at his post-\nconviction hearing and thus did not say that he would not have pled guilty but for the\nadvice of counsel.\n\n       After a careful review of the record, we agree with the district court. The state\ncourt’s determination that defense counsel’s performance was not deficient was not\n\fNo. 09-5021           Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 19\n\n\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. Moreover, even if we were\nto find deficient performance, Hodges has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the\nperformance.4\n\n        To establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Hodges must show that (1)\nhis counsel’s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced\nthe defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687–88. An attorney’s performance is deficient if\nit is objectively unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. Id. at 688. “[A]\ncourt must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the\npresumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered\nsound trial strategy.” Id. at 689. The test for prejudice is whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings\nwould have been different. Id. at 694. To show prejudice in the guilty-plea context, a\ndefendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors,\nhe would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.”\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59. “[W]here the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise the\ndefendant of a potential affirmative defense to the crime charged, the resolution of the\n‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely on whether the affirmative defense likely would\nhave succeeded at trial.” Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court has recently noted that “[e]stablishing that a state court’s\napplication of Strickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult.”\nHarrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 788 (2011). “The standards created by Strickland\nand § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is\ndoubly so.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Therefore, “[w]hen\n§ 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The\n\n\n\n        4\n          We note that two recent Supreme Court cases—Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376 (2012), and\nMissouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012)—recognizing a Sixth Amendment right to effective\nrepresentation during plea-deal negotiations are not implicated here. The record does not reflect that\nHodges was offered any plea deal, so the existing legal standard under Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\n52 (1985), and its progeny remains the law.\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 20\n\n\nquestion is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s\ndeferential standard.” Id.\n\n        A.      Performance\n\n        Using the “doubly” deferential standards of § 2254(d) and Strickland, we\nconclude that the state court’s determination that defense counsel’s performance was not\ndeficient was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law. Trial\ncounsel advised Hodges to plead guilty because of the overwhelming evidence of his\nguilt, to give the defense credibility, to limit the proof the prosecution could present, and\nto show Hodges’s remorse.\n\n        The Supreme Court has explicitly approved using the American Bar Association\n(“ABA”) Guidelines on attorney performance in effect at the time of a defendant’s trial\nas “guides to determining what is reasonable” performance by counsel. See, e.g., Padilla\nv. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 1482 (2010). However, “ABA Guidelines are not\n‘inexorable commands’; rather, they are ‘only guides to what reasonableness means, not\nits definition.’” Post v. Bradshaw, 621 F.3d 406, 418 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bobby v.\nVan Hook, 130 S. Ct. 13, 17 (2009)) (some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        The ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of Hodges’s trial contemplated\nnegotiated guilty pleas only where the defendant is assured of a sentence less than death.\nABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty\nCases (“ABA Guidelines”), § 11.6.1 (1989). “If no written guarantee can be obtained\nthat death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely\nreluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.” Id. § 11.6.3 cmt.\n\n        Courts also find that a defendant has little to gain from pleading guilty in a\ncapital case, even when the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. “[P]leading guilty [in a\ncapital case] without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence\nholds little if any benefit for the defendant.” Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 191 n.6\n(2004) (citing ABA Guidelines § 10.9.2 cmt. (rev.ed. 2003)). The Nixon Court noted\nthat pleading guilty “increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 21\n\n\nevidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime\nare fresh in the jurors’ minds as they deliberate on the sentence.” Id. Nevertheless, the\nCourt concluded that “counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress\nthe jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.” Id. at 192\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       This court has also recently decided a similar, but distinguishable, case. In Post,\n621 F.3d at 415–18, a pre-Richter case, we addressed whether trial counsel’s advice to\nenter a no-contest plea and to submit the penalty phase to a three-judge panel rather than\na jury was objectively reasonable under Strickland. Using de novo review, we\nconcluded that the defendant’s weak mitigation case made the decision reasonable,\nnoting that “[the defendant’s] counsel were between a rock and a hard place in\ndetermining the best way to spare him a death sentence, given the overwhelming\nevidence of his guilt, his numerous confessions, and his refusal to plead guilty.” Id at\n418. We held that although the no-contest plea resulted in the defendant’s being\n“sentenced by judges, not jurors, and by three persons rather than twelve,” the strategy\nwas professionally reasonable because the sentencing judges could have viewed the no-\ncontest plea as a mitigating factor (although ultimately they did not). Id. at 417.\n\n       Trial counsel’s advice to plead guilty here was questionable. Defense counsel\nhoped that Hodges’s pleading guilty would accomplish the following:               (1) gain\ncredibility with the jury, (2) demonstrate Hodges’s remorse, (3) limit the evidence\npresented to the jury, and (4) surprise the prosecution and thereby limit the effectiveness\nof its penalty case. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals noted that although the\ngoals of counsel were reasonable, Hodges “ultimately gained nothing by pleading\nguilty.” Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *20. For example, despite counsel’s attempt to\nlimit the evidence presented to the jury, a vast majority of what they hoped to keep out\nwas allowed in. Trina Brown testified that Hodges planned to rob and kill the next\nperson who propositioned him, and that he discussed how to carry out the crimes. She\nalso told the jury that Hodges bound the victim’s hands and feet and that, after she and\nHodges ransacked the victim’s apartment, Hodges strangled the victim, who was\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 22\n\n\nbegging for his life. Hodges, 944 S.W.2d at 349. Police officers testified that the\nvictim’s belongings were found in Hodges’s possession when he was arrested, that\nHodges’s fingerprints were found in the victim’s home, and that Brown was\nphotographed using the victim’s ATM card. Id. at 350.\n\n        Defense counsel did successfully limit the prosecution’s cross-examination of\nHodges; the State was permitted to ask questions only about his personal history, and not\nabout the circumstances of the offense. Id. at 350 n.6. However, the same result could\nhave been achieved by putting on a reasonable doubt defense and having Hodges testify\nonly during the sentencing hearing. This is also true of defense counsel’s goals of\ngaining credibility with the jury and showing remorse.\n\n        Moreover, defense attorney Dawson testified in the state post-conviction\nproceeding that the defense team “never sat down and did an analysis of what are the\nbenefits of going to trial, what are the deficits and where did that lead us.” He also\ntestified that when the defense team advised Hodges to plead guilty, he had “totally\nforgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated robbery; a conviction on\nthat count constituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase.\n\n        However, trial counsel also acknowledged that the evidence of Hodges’s guilt\nwas overwhelming. As counsel explained during the state post-conviction proceeding,\ndespite their advice that he should not speak with reporters, Hodges participated in a pre-\ntrial television series in which he gave interviews “describing himself as a serial killer.”\nAttorney Dawson described the difficulties that arose from representing such a client:\n“We had a client that was confessing to the public on eight murders. And he had written\nto the court; he had written to the prosecutor, a confession to the case that we had to try.\nIt looked pretty dismal.” Trial counsel summarized the evidence against Hodges:\nHodges made inculpatory statements to police, prosecutors, the trial court, and television\nreporters; his fingerprints were at the scene of the crime; he had items from the victim’s\nhouse with him when he was arrested; Trina Brown gave a statement implicating him;\nthere were photos of Brown using the victim’s bank card; and Brown’s fingerprints were\non the victim’s card.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 23\n\n\n        The defense team talked to Hodges about the decision to plead guilty and\nreviewed the guilty plea form with him. Hodges thanked his attorneys for their work and\nnever complained about their representation.\n\n        If it were our task to determine whether trial counsel’s performance was deficient\nbecause they advised Hodges to plead guilty, the decision would be a more difficult one.\nThe ABA Guidelines at the time of the plea contemplated guilty pleas in capital cases\nonly in exchange for a guarantee from the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.\nHere, no such exchange was made, and Hodges gained little—if anything—from his\nplea.\n\n        However, the “ABA Guidelines are not inexorable commands,” Post, 621 F.3d\nat 418 (internal quotation marks omitted), and our task is not to determine whether trial\ncounsel’s performance was deficient. Rather, we must determine “whether there is any\nreasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Richter,\n131 S. Ct. at 788 (emphasis added). And here, as identified by the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals, there is a reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s\ndeferential standard. Although not directly on point, the considerations in this case are\nsimilar to those faced by this court in Post: “[C]ounsel were between a rock and a hard\nplace in determining the best way to spare [the defendant] a death sentence, given the\noverwhelming evidence of his guilt, [and] his numerous confessions.” 621 F.3d at 418.\nAnd in Post, we found that counsel’s actions were reasonable under a de novo standard\nof review, id., which is far less stringent than the “doubly” deferential standard that we\nmust apply here, see Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. Although there is some evidence that\ncounsel here failed to appreciate fully the impact of their decision, that is not material\nto the issue before us: whether there is “any reasonable argument” that counsel’s\nrecommendation to plead guilty satisfies Strickland. As the Supreme Court has stated,\n“[C]ounsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his\ncandor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 192.\n\n        Ultimately, the state court that addressed this issue concluded that, “[a]lthough\ndefense counsel’s strategy for avoiding the death penalty was thwarted, the decision to\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 24\n\n\npursue that particular strategy cannot be deemed incompetent.” Hodges, 2000 WL\n1562865, at *20. Under the doubly deferential standard imposed by § 2254(d) and\nStrickland, we simply cannot say that conclusion is contrary to or involves an\nunreasonable application of federal law.\n\n       B.      Prejudice\n\n       Even if we did find that the state court’s decision on trial counsel’s performance\nwas unreasonable, we could not grant relief because Hodges has failed to establish\nprejudice. As noted above, to show prejudice in the guilty-plea context, a defendant\n“must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would\nnot have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.” Hill, 474\nU.S. at 59.\n\n       Because the state courts found that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient,\nthe state courts did not address the prejudice prong of the Strickland inquiry. We have\npreviously held that where a state court addresses only the performance prong of the\nStrickland inquiry, this court will review the prejudice prong de novo. See Morales v.\nMitchell, 507 F.3d 916, 935 (6th Cir. 2007). However, the Supreme Court’s decision in\nRichter requires us to apply AEDPA deference to our review of the prejudice prong even\nwhere—as here—the state court reviewed only the performance prong.\n\n       In Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 784, the Supreme Court stated,\n\n       Where a state court’s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the\n       habeas petitioner’s burden still must be met by showing there was no\n       reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief. This is so whether or\n       not the state court reveals which of the elements in a multipart claim it\n       found insufficient, for § 2254(d) applies when a “claim,” not a\n       component of one, has been adjudicated.\n\n(emphasis added). The Court went on to say, “[w]hen a federal claim has been presented\nto a state court and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed that the state\ncourt adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law\nprocedural principles to the contrary.” Id. at 784–85. Here, the state court did address\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 25\n\n\nHodges’s ineffective assistance of counsel “claim,” so AEDPA deference applies to the\nentire claim regardless of whether the state court explicitly addressed every\n“component” (i.e., the prejudice prong) of that claim. See id at 784.\n\n       Moreover, as a matter of logic, a finding that counsel’s performance was not\ndeficient implicitly, but unequivocally, encompasses a finding that the performance did\nnot prejudice the defendant. Indeed, it would be nonsensical to argue that a performance\ndeemed to be constitutionally sufficient nevertheless prejudiced the defendant. It must\nbe assumed that a state court’s decision that performance was not deficient includes a\ndecision that the performance was not prejudicial. Richter explicitly holds that a state\ncourt decision is entitled to AEDPA deference, even if the state court has not given\nreasons for that decision, “in the absence of any indication” that state-law procedural\nprinciples were responsible for the state court’s decision. Id. at 785.\n\n       Here, the state court adjudicated Hodges’s ineffective assistance claim, and there\nwas no indication that state-law procedural principles were responsible for the state\ncourt’s decision.   Accordingly, we must review the entire claim under AEDPA\ndeference, including the prejudice prong. Our task is therefore to determine whether\nthere was “[any] reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.” Id. at 784.\n\n       We find that there was. In Hill, 474 U.S. at 59, the Supreme Court held that in\nthe context of a challenge to a guilty plea, to establish prejudice a defendant need only\nshow that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel’s errors, he would\nnot have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.” The Court went on\nto give two examples. First, it noted that where the alleged error involves failure to\ninvestigate or discover exculpatory information, “the determination of whether the error\n‘prejudiced’ the defendant . . . will depend in large part on a prediction whether the\nevidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.” Id. Second, it noted that\nwhere the alleged error involves a failure to advise the defendant of possible affirmative\ndefenses, “the resolution of the ‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely on whether the\naffirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.” Id. It is therefore clear that\nin determining whether a defendant has shown prejudice, a court must predict whether\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 26\n\n\ncorrection of the deficient performance might have enabled the defendant to succeed at\ntrial. “[T]hese predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be\nmade objectively, without regard for the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.”\nId. at 59–60.\n\n       This court has previously noted that “testimony, though self-serving, may be\nenough by itself to satisfy the prejudice prong.” Miller v. Straub, 299 F.3d 570, 581 (6th\nCir. 2002). In Miller, the defendants testified at a hearing that they entered their guilty\npleas with hesitation and would not have pled guilty but for counsel’s advice. Id. The\ncourt also noted that one of the defendants presented, in the form of testimony from his\ntrial counsel, “additional evidence that, with competent assistance, he would have pled\nnot guilty.” Id. at 582. Trial counsel testified that the defendant “pled guilty only\nreluctantly,” and the court concluded that “the fact that [trial counsel] had to prevail\nupon [the defendant] to plead guilty tends to corroborate [the defendant’s] testimony that\nhe would have pled not guilty.” Id. The court concluded that the defendants’\n“testimony, along with reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances of this\ncase,” established prejudice under Hill. Id. at 583.\n\n       In Hodges’s case, particularly under the doubly deferential standards of AEDPA\nand Strickland, we cannot conclude that Hodges has established a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s advice, he would not have pled guilty. In fact, the only evidence\nconcerning this issue appears in Hodges’s Verified Amended Petition for Post\nConviction Relief filed on March 24, 1998. There, notably, Hodges did not say that had\nhe had better advice he would not have pled guilty. Rather, his statement was:\n\n       Had trial counsel performed the above investigations and informed\n       Petitioner of the result of those investigations, and had counsel timely\n       communicated with Petitioner and given him the above advice, a\n       reasonable probability exists that Petitioner would not have pleaded\n       guilty to all counts in the indictment, but, rather, would have insisted on\n       going to trial.\n\fNo. 09-5021            Hodges v. Colson                                                           Page 27\n\n\nAt the end of the document, Hodges’s signature appears, verifying that the “foregoing\nallegations of fact are true and correct to the best of [his] information and belief.”5\n\n         In contrast to the defendants in Miller, Hodges has never personally testified\nabout his decision to plead guilty and whether he would have pled not guilty but for the\nadvice of counsel. Moreover, unlike in Miller, where “reasonable inferences from the\nfacts and circumstances” of the case suggested that the defendants would not have pled\nguilty but for advice of counsel, no such inferences exist here. To the contrary, any\ninferences that can be made make it clear that Hodges would have pled guilty regardless\nof what his counsel recommended. Leading up to trial, Hodges embraced his guilt. For\ninstance, against the advice of counsel, he participated in a pre-trial television series in\nwhich he gave interviews “describing himself as a serial killer.” Hodges also implicated\nhimself in letters to the court and prosecutor. Those simply are not the actions of a\ndefendant hoping to avoid a guilty plea, nor do they help establish a reasonable\nprobability that Hodges would have pled not guilty if so advised by counsel.\n\n         Furthermore, Hill instructs us to examine how competent counsel might have\ninfluenced the outcome of a hypothetical trial, see 474 U.S. at 59–60, and there is\nvirtually no chance that Hodges could have avoided convictions by proceeding to trial.\nAs has been discussed repeatedly, the evidence against Hodges was overwhelming, and\nhe only made the situation worse by corresponding with reporters, the court, and the\nprosecutor against the advice of his counsel. Similarly, we have no evidence or reason\nto believe that the penalty phase of trial would have proceeded differently had there first\nbeen a full guilt phase.\n\n         A self-serving statement, couched in exactly the terms of the Supreme Court’s\nstandard, and filed as a required part of Hodges’s verified petition for post-conviction\nrelief, cannot establish a reasonable probability that Hodges would have pled not guilty\nbut for the advice of counsel, where all objective evidence points unequivocally to the\ncontrary. Accordingly, it is clear that the state court had a reasonable basis for denying\n\n         5\n         We note that the verification oath and signature is required of all post-conviction petitions filed\nin Tennessee. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-204(e) (1997).\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 28\n\n\nrelief on this claim. Hodges is not entitled to relief on his claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel at the plea phase.\n\nIV.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Sentencing Phase & Incompetency at\n        Trial\n\n        Hodges argues that the district court erred when it denied him an evidentiary\nhearing on his claims that he was incompetent at trial and that his trial counsel were\nineffective at sentencing. He also argues that the district court erred when it denied his\ncompetency and ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the merits.\n\n        Hodges failed to present his claim of incompetency at trial to the state courts, and\nhe no longer has any state court remedies to exhaust. See Fletcher v. Tennessee,\n951 S.W.2d 378, 380–81 (Tenn. 1997) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-217(a) (1996\nSupp.)). The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted.\n\n        Hodges argues that substantive competency claims cannot be procedurally\ndefaulted, citing cases from the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits. See Battle v. United States,\n419 F.3d 1292, 1298 (11th Cir. 2005); Walker v. Gibson, 228 F.3d 1217, 1229 (10th Cir.\n2000); Adams v. Wainwright, 764 F.2d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir. 1985). However, neither\nthe Supreme Court nor this court has adopted such a rule, and we decline to do so here.\nAs the Ninth Circuit noted in LaFlamme v. Hubbard, No. 97-16973, 2000 WL 757525,\nat *2 (9th Cir. Mar. 16, 2000), those courts that have held that substantive competency\nclaims cannot be procedurally defaulted appear to have conflated the distinct concepts\nof waiver and procedural default. Although it is true that substantive competency claims\ncannot be waived, Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 384 (1966) (“it is contradictory to\nargue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly or intelligently ‘waive’\nhis right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial”), they can be\nprocedurally defaulted. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that, “unlike waiver, the\nprocedural default rule does not rely on the petitioner’s voluntary abandonment of a\nknown right, but only on the fact that the claim was rejected by the state court on\nindependent and adequate state grounds.” LaFlamme, 2000 WL 757525, at *2 (internal\nquotation marks and formatting omitted). We hereby hold that substantive competency\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 29\n\n\nclaims are subject to the same rules of procedural default as all other claims that may be\npresented on habeas.\n\n        Hodges also cannot rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to\nexcuse the default. As we mentioned, the Supreme Court’s decision in Martinez puts yet\nanother wrinkle in the crushed velvet that is federal habeas corpus jurisprudence, but the\nMartinez rule is not implicated here. Martinez held that where the state courts do not\npermit ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims to be brought on direct appeal but\nrequire they be brought on collateral attack, ineffective assistance of collateral counsel\ncan provide cause to excuse procedural default. See Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1315–16.\nBut Tennessee does not require prisoners to bring ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nclaims on collateral attack—prisoners may bring them on direct appeal. See State v.\nHoneycutt, 54 S.W.3d 762, 766 & n.6 (Tenn. 2001); State v. Anderson, 835 S.W.2d 600,\n607 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992); State v. Smith, 2011 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 830, at\n*33–35 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 14, 2011). Tennessee’s system does not implicate the\nsame concerns as those that triggered the rule in Martinez because in Tennessee a\ncollateral proceeding is not “the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim\nof ineffective assistance at trial.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1320. And in any event, here\nHodges did not default an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim; he defaulted his\nclaim that he was not competent to stand trial. Accordingly, the Coleman rule still\napplies, and ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel may not provide cause to\nexcuse default of his competency claim. Because Hodges has not presented any\nevidence to justify review of his claim in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of\njustice, see Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96, the substantive competency claim is barred, and\nwe will review the ineffective assistance claim only to the extent that it concerns failure\nto investigate and present additional mitigating evidence.\n\n        In his state post-conviction petition, Hodges claimed that trial counsel were\nineffective for failing to investigate and present additional mitigating evidence.\nAccording to Hodges, his counsel should have obtained prison records that showed he\ntold a doctor that he was raped as a boy and should have interviewed additional people\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                            Page 30\n\n\nwho were familiar with his background. Hodges also asserted that trial counsel failed\nto investigate evidence concerning the causes, effects, and treatment of substance abuse;\nfailed to adequately prepare him for his testimony; and failed to make effective use of\nexperts.      Hodges requested, and the trial court granted, $15,000 for mitigation\ninvestigation; but the trial court denied Hodges’s request for additional funds to hire a\ndrug and alcohol specialist, a mitigation specialist, and a fingerprint expert. At the\nevidentiary hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Hodges’s trial counsel, a\nclinical sociologist who helped prepare Hodges’s mitigation case, the Tennessee District\nPublic Defender’s Conference chief counsel, and a mitigation specialist retained for the\npost-conviction proceeding. Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *4–*12. The trial court\ndenied Hodges’s petition.\n\n         The appellate court affirmed, finding that Hodges had not presented any evidence\nin post-conviction proceedings that was substantially different from the proof introduced\nat the penalty phase. Id. at *27. The court found that the experts presented at the\npenalty phase, with one exception, were in possession of the same records about Hodges\nused by the post-conviction mitigation specialist, and that additional evidence from\nfurther mitigation investigation would have been cumulative to the evidence obtained\nby trial counsel before sentencing. Id. It stated, “[g]iven the records presently before\nthis court, we conclude that trial counsel adequately investigated the appellant’s\nbackground and presented a case in mitigation that was supported by the information\nintroduced.” Id. The appellate court also held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by denying Hodges the additional funds he requested because his post-\nconviction counsel were capable of presenting the available mitigation information\nwithout expert assistance. Id. at *29.\n\n         A.       Evidentiary Hearing\n\n         “This court reviews a district court’s decision whether to hold an evidentiary\nhearing for an abuse of discretion.” Vroman v. Brigano, 346 F.3d 598, 606 (6th Cir.\n2003).\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 31\n\n\n       Generally, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2) governs whether a district court should hold\nan evidentiary hearing in a habeas proceeding. Section 2254(e)(2) states that, with a few\nexceptions, “[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State\ncourt proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim.” Hodges\ndoes not argue that one of the exceptions applies; instead, he argues that he did not fail\nto develop the factual basis of his claim and is therefore entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n       We need not decide whether Hodges developed the factual basis of his claim in\nstate court because the Supreme Court’s decision in Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388\n(2011), prohibits us from considering new evidence in this case. The Court held that\n“review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.” Id. at 1398. It reasoned that the language of the\nstatute is “backward-looking” and “requires an examination of the state-court decision\nat the time it was made. It follows that the record under review is limited to the record\nin existence at that same time i.e., the record before the state court.” Id. The Court also\nnoted that its holding did not “render[] § 2254(e)(2) superfluous” because it “continues\nto have force where § 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief.” Id. at 1400–01.\n\n       Hodges’s ineffective assistance claim was brought under § 2254(d)(1), and it was\nadjudicated on the merits by the state courts. Pinholster therefore applies. It was a\nreasonable exercise of the district court’s discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing on\nthe claim, because any evidence introduced would be “irrelevant” and “have no bearing\non § 2254(d)(1) review” in any event. See id. at 1400.\n\n       B.      Ineffective Assistance\n\n       To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, Hodges\nmust show both that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. With respect to\nperformance, “counsel should be strongly presumed to have rendered adequate\nassistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional\njudgment.” Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1403. An attorney’s failure to reasonably\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 32\n\n\ninvestigate the defendant’s background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at\nsentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.\n510, 521–22 (2003). However, “Strickland does not require counsel to investigate every\nconceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to\nassist the defendant at sentencing.” Id. at 533. The court must consider not only the\nevidence known to counsel, but also whether that evidence “would lead a reasonable\nattorney to investigate further.” Id. at 527. “[I]f a habeas claim does not involve a\nfailure to investigate but, rather, petitioner’s dissatisfaction with the degree of his\nattorney’s investigation, the presumption of reasonableness imposed by Strickland will\nbe hard to overcome.” Campbell v. Coyle, 260 F.3d 531, 552 (6th Cir. 2001) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “[T]here is no prejudice when the new mitigating evidence\n‘would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented’ to the decisionmaker.”\nSears v. Upton, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 3266 (2010) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700).\n\n       “Establishing that a state court’s application of Strickland was unreasonable\nunder § 2254(d) is all the more difficult.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. “The standards\ncreated by Strickland and § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply\nin tandem, review is doubly so.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nTherefore, “[w]hen § 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s actions were\nreasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel\nsatisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Id.\n\n       The state court record supports the conclusion that Hodges’s trial counsel\nreasonably investigated Hodges’s background and presented mitigating evidence. The\nTennessee Supreme Court summarized the mitigation evidence presented at sentencing\nas follows:\n\n       In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of\n       his mother, his brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist.\n       This proof showed that the defendant was the next to youngest of his\n       mother’s five sons. His mother and father were not married. His father\n       was actually married to another woman, but engaged in what one of the\n       witnesses described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother\n       for eighteen years. The defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother\n\fNo. 09-5021      Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 33\n\n\n      and was strict with the defendant’s brothers, three of whom were the\n      children of another man. The defendant, however, was his father’s\n      favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties forced the family to move\n      about frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family only\n      sporadically.\n      The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until\n      he was twelve years old. At that time, he began to associate with older\n      boys, sniff glue and gasoline, be truant from school, and run away from\n      home. He also engaged in sexual activities with his younger brother and\n      attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He became involved\n      with the juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in\n      Chattanooga.\n      Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that\n      a catalyst and major contributing cause of his delinquent and later\n      criminal behavior was his rape and sexual abuse by a stranger when he\n      was twelve years old. According to the defendant, he accepted a\n      stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from\n      his home on Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges\n      home, the stranger drove Hodges to his home and raped him. Fearing\n      rejection by his homophobic father and driven by guilt, the defendant\n      told no one of this incident until he was arrested in 1990.\n      Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an\n      antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and substance\n      (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated by a subconscious desire for\n      revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was twelve,\n      coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was\n      engaged in homosexual prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic]\n      sister-in-law shortly before the killing that he was a homosexual\n      prostitute. The defense also introduced testimony that Brown dominated\n      and manipulated the defendant.\n      In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and\n      Dr. Leonard Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the\n      defendant and concluded that he suffered from an antisocial personality\n      disorder. They described persons with this disorder as having “no\n      conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest and\n      untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and\n      . . . willing to use any means to get what they want, no matter who it\n      hurts.” While acknowledging the complicated factors involved in\n      antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts discounted the\n      singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in\n      causing the defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 34\n\n\n       defendant “was in complete control of his behavior” and not suffering\n       from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\n\nHodges, 944 S.W.2d at 350–51. Because Hodges alleges that his trial counsel’s\nmitigation case overlooked significant aspects of his background, the mitigation\ntestimony merits more detailed attention.\n\n       Dr. Nurcombe, head of child psychiatry at Vanderbilt Medical School, testified\nthat he specialized in juvenile delinquency and the effects of sexual abuse, and that he\nhad examined at least 500 children. To assess Hodges, Dr. Nurcombe reviewed his\nschool records, legal records, mental health records, and the results of an investigation\nby a private investigation group concerning his family background. He also interviewed\nHodges for a total of nine hours on three occasions, and had a one-hour phone interview\nwith him.     The mental health records available to Dr. Nurcombe included five\npsychological tests from the age of twelve to late adolescence. He found no evidence\nthat Hodges was insane, but he did say that Hodges was not mentally healthy. He also\nsaid that Hodges suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and\nsubstance abuse.\n\n       In addition to Dr. Nurcombe, Hodges’s counsel presented six other witnesses at\nsentencing: Hodges’s mother, three of his brothers, a neighbor, and Hodges himself. The\ntestimony generally showed that Hodges had a difficult childhood in a low-income,\ndysfunctional family and that his behavior significantly worsened at the age of twelve,\naround the time he claims to have been raped. However, Hodges himself admitted that\nhis parents treated him well, and that his mother took him for mental health treatment\nmany times.\n\n       At the state post-conviction proceeding, Hodges presented additional testimony.\nHe presented the testimony of his trial counsel, each of whom explained that they did not\nsufficiently prepare for the sentencing phase of trial. He also presented the evidence of\nDr. Ann Charvet, a clinical sociologist, who explained that she did not think the\nmitigation information she had compiled was used properly by the defense team, but was\nunable to suggest any specific information that Dr. Nurcombe or other witnesses failed\n\fNo. 09-5021           Hodges v. Colson                                            Page 35\n\n\nto present to the jury. He presented the testimony of David Keefe, chief counsel of the\nTennessee District Public Defender’s Conference, who had reviewed Hodges’s counsel’s\nrepresentation and concluded that it was deficient. Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *10.\nAnd he presented the evidence of mitigation specialist Julie Hackenmiller, who holds\na masters degree in forensic psychology. She discussed mitigation themes that were not\ndeveloped at trial.\n\n       Although the evidence presented at the post-conviction proceeding shows that\ntrial counsel’s performance was not perfect, in light of the substantial and competent\nevidence produced at the penalty phase of Hodges’s trial, Hodges has not shown that the\nTennessee state court’s decision that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient was\nunreasonable. The burden of proof is on Hodges, Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398, and\nunder the “doubly deferential” standards imposed by § 2254(d) and Strickland, id. at\n1403, Hodges has not carried that burden. Here, Hodges’s counsel retained a mitigation\nspecialist and several experts. Defense counsel obtained most of Hodges’s available\nschool, medical, and juvenile records. Dr. Nurcombe used those records and his\ninterviews with Hodges to diagnose him, testify at length about his background, and link\nhis homosexual rape at age twelve and his exposure as a homosexual prostitute to his\ncrime. The testimony of Hodges’s family members was consistent with Dr. Nurcombe’s\ntestimony and conclusions. And in post-conviction proceedings, Hodges identified little\ninformation not considered by Dr. Nurcombe.\n\n       The circumstances of this case are similar to those considered by the Supreme\nCourt in Bobby v. Van Hook, 130 S. Ct. 13 (2009). There, the petitioner claimed that his\ncounsel were ineffective because their mitigation investigation was insufficient. Id. at\n18. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that although the petitioner was tried less\nthan three months after his indictment, trial counsel spoke with his parents, an aunt, and\na family friend; consulted with two expert witnesses; contacted the Veterans\nAdministration and sought medical records; and enlisted a mitigation specialist. Id.\nTrial counsel also presented evidence that the petitioner began drinking and using drugs\nas a child, witnessed his father abuse his mother, had violent fantasies, attempted suicide\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                  Page 36\n\n\nfive times, suffered from borderline personality disorder, consumed drugs and alcohol\non the day of the crime, and may have been motivated by a “homosexual panic.” Id. at\n18–19. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner’s argument that his counsel could\nhave found more mitigating evidence by interviewing other members of his extended\nfamily and a psychiatrist who once treated his mother:\n\n        [T]here comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can\n        reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and search for it\n        distractive from more important duties. . . . [I]t was not unreasonable for\n        [the petitioner’s] counsel not to identify and interview every other living\n        family member or every therapist who once treated his parents.\n\nId. at 19.\n\n        Here, given the mitigation evidence Hodges’s counsel gathered from his family\nand Dr. Nurcombe’s review of his background, it was reasonable for counsel not to\nidentify and interview more distant family members or review their mental health. And\nto the extent that Hodges argues that counsel were ineffective for relying on Dr.\nNurcombe, see Pet.’s Br. at 15 (describing Nurcombe as “a Court TV pundant [sic]”),\n112 (Nurcombe “fail[ed] to conduct the sort of thorough personal history that is\nnecessary to come to an accurate diagnosis”), his argument fails because Hodges has not\nshown that trial counsel had good reason to believe Dr. Nurcombe was incompetent, or,\nfor that matter, that he was incompetent.6 See Fautenberry v. Mitchell, 515 F.3d 614,\n625 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[The petitioner] has not shown that counsel had good reason to\nbelieve that [the expert] was incompetent, and we conclude that it was objectively\nreasonable for counsel to rely upon the doctor’s opinions and conclusions.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Lundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 772 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(counsel’s reliance on mental health experts was reasonable because petitioner presented\nno evidence that they were not competent); Clark v. Mitchell, 425 F.3d 270, 286 (6th\nCir. 2005) (counsel reasonably relied on the opinions of a psychologist and psychiatrist\nin not seeking additional testing).\n\n\n        6\n         Indeed, we believe that the record shows that Dr. Nurcombe’s theory and testimony were\ncompetent.\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 37\n\n\n        Where, as here, trial counsel puts on a reasonable mitigation case and presents\nnearly all of the same information as presented by the petitioner’s post-conviction\nexperts, we cannot find deficient performance. And we certainly cannot find that the\nstate court’s decision that trial counsels’ performance was not deficient was\nunreasonable. “As Strickland made clear, our role on habeas review is not to nitpick\ngratuitously counsel’s performance. After all, the constitutional right at issue here is\nultimately the right to a fair trial, not to perfect representation.” Smith v. Mitchell, 348\nF.3d 177, 206 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684).\n\n        Because we find that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient, we need not\naddress whether Hodges was prejudiced by that performance. Hodges is not entitled to\nhabeas relief on this claim.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Hodges’s\npetition for habeas relief.\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v.

Performance\n\n        The Supreme Court has explicitly approved using ABA Guidelines on attorney\nperformance in effect at the time of a defendant’s trial as “guides to determining what\nis reasonable” performance by counsel. Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S. Ct.\n1473, 1482 (2010); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU.S. 510, 524 (2003); see also Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4, 130 S. Ct. 13, 16 (2009)\n(per curiam). “ABA Guidelines are not ‘inexorable commands’; rather, they are ‘only\nguides to what reasonableness means, not its definition.’” Post v. Bradshaw, 621 F.3d\n406, 418 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bobby, 130 S. Ct. at 17) (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). As discussed by the majority, the 1989 ABA Guidelines for the\nAppointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases,1 which were in effect\nat the time of Hodges’s 1992 trial, disapprove entering a guilty plea in a capital case\nwithout the prosecution’s agreement not to seek the death penalty in exchange for the\nguilty plea. The Guidelines state that “[i]t is suggested that [pleading a client guilty and\nthen putting on a contested penalty hearing] is an effective strategy only when the\nattorney knows without any doubt that no death sentence will result. Any other\n‘strategy’ for entering a guilty plea is ill-advised and should be abandoned.” ABA\nGuidelines § 11.6.2 cmt. n.2 ) (emphasis in original) (quoting Dept. of Public Advocacy,\nKENTUCKY PUBLIC ADVOCATE DEATH PENALTY MANUAL, p. 328–333\n\n\n        1\n          ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel\ni n     D e a t h   P e n a l t y     C a s e s     ( 1 9 8 9 ) ,     a v a i l a b l e     a t :\nhttp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/DeathPenalty/RepresentationProject/PublicDoc\numents/1989Guidelines.authcheckdam.pdf\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 39\n\n\n(1983)). Further, “[i]f no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be\nimposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate\nin a waiver of the client’s trial rights.” Id. § 11.6.3 cmt.; see also id. § 11.6.2 cmt.\n(“Counsel should insist that no plea to an offense for which the death penalty can be\nimposed will be considered without a written guarantee, binding on the court or other\nfinal sentencer, that death will not be imposed.”).\n\n        “[I]n a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and\npenalty phases in determining how best to proceed.” Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175,\n192 (2004). Donald Dawson, one of Hodges’s trial attorneys, testified in the post-\nconviction proceeding in state trial court that the decision to have Hodges plead guilty\nwas made during the weekend prior to trial when the attorneys “sat down and pretty\nmuch saw the guilt-innocence phase as hopeless.” J.A. at 1745. The attorneys were\n“trying to figure out what was the way to limit the jurors[’] bad feelings about us [a]nd\n[we] thought that by pleading guilty, we could give the defense some credibility.” Id.\nat 1746; see also id. (“[W]e [thought we] could get the jury to sort of be thankful to us\nthat we didn’t make them sit through a guilt-innocence phase and we wouldn’t lose our\nown credibility by arguing the guilt or innocence and we would have a better chance to\nget a life verdict.”).\n\n        On its face, this appears to be the sort of strategic trial decision owed deference\nunder Strickland. However, Dawson also testified that the defense team did “[n]ot\nadequately” think through the decision to plead guilty: “we never sat down and did an\nanalysis of what are the benefits of going to trial, what are the deficits and where did that\nlead us.” Id. Dawson testified that at the time of trial, the defense team had not read\navailable literature setting out standards for adequate representation in capital cases. Id.\nat 1747. In particular, the attorneys were unfamiliar with “the advantages of putting [on]\na defense [in the guilt phase] consistent with your mitigation theory.” Id. They also\nfailed to appreciate the advantages of “hav[ing] the jury . . . have a chance to look at\nyour client longer and find him guilty[,] [a]nd then decide [‘]now that we find him\nguilty, let’s see . . . [w]hat is the proper sentencing[’].” This would allow the jury to not\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 40\n\n\nview the penalty phase as its only opportunity to pass judgment on the defendant’s\nactions. Id. at 1748; see also id. at 1841–43 (post-conviction hearing testimony of\nMichael Terry). The attorneys conducted no legal research into proper considerations\nin deciding whether to plead guilty, and did not weigh the possible benefits of putting\non a case at the guilt phase of trial. Id. at 1748–1751; see also id. at 1839 (testimony of\nMichael Terry).\n\n       Dawson also testified that nearly all of the evidence that he and the other\nattorneys hoped to keep out by pleading guilty came in anyway at the sentencing phase,\nas should have been clear from an analysis of Tennessee law. Id. at 1752–53. Finally,\nDawson stated that when he advised Hodges to plead guilty, the attorneys had “totally\nforgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated robbery, a conviction of\nwhich constituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase. Id. at\n1756–57. In fact, Dawson did not “recall having talked to Mr. Hodges at all about\npleading to the robbery.” Id. at 1757. Both Dawson and co-trial-counsel Michael Terry\nstated that pleading guilty was a mistake. Id. at 1755, 1762–63, 1842. Terry stated that\nhe “would not plead a capital defendant guilty again in any case.” Id. at 1842.\n\n       Additionally, in the post-conviction hearing, the court heard testimony from\nDavid Keefe, chief counsel for the capital division of the Tennessee District Public\nDefender’s Conference, who examined the conduct of Hodges’s trial counsel at the\nrequest of Hodges’s post-conviction attorneys. Keefe testified that he “believed the\ndecision to plead guilty was wrong and hastily made. He opined that, by pleading guilty,\nthe defense team confused the jury and lost an array of appellate issues.” Hodges,\n2000 WL 1562865, at *10. Thus, although the decision to plead guilty was indeed a\n“strategic” decision designed to curry favor with the jury and limit the prosecution’s\npresentation of evidence, it was not intelligently made based on a weighing of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of going to trial in the guilt phase, and was made without\nreference to secondary authorities providing standards for representation in death penalty\ncases. Further, the strategy was ill-designed to achieve one of its primary aims: limiting\npresentation of damaging evidence about the crime. Therefore, advising Hodges to\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 41\n\n\nplead guilty was inconsistent with the prevailing standard of competent representation\nin death penalty cases.\n\n        Post v. Bradshaw, 621 F.3d 406 (6th Cir. 2010), discussed by the majority, is\ndistinguishable. In Post, the defendant “refused to plead guilty, despite the State’s offer\nof a life sentence in return for a guilty plea.” Id. at 417. The case addressed the question\nwhether the decision to enter a no-contest plea and to submit the penalty phase to a\nthree-judge panel rather than a jury was objectively reasonable. The court concluded\nthat the defendant’s weak mitigation evidence made the attorneys’ decision to forgo the\nright to a penalty-phase jury reasonable. Id. The Post court thus stated that “Post’s\ncounsel were between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way to spare him\na death sentence, given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, his numerous\nconfessions, and his refusal to plead guilty.” Id. at 418. Although these considerations\nare similar to those facing Hodges’s attorneys, the Post decision does not suggest that\ndefense counsel failed to appreciate the import of their decision. Indeed, the opinion\nindicates that counsel weighed the pros and cons of pleading no contest and putting the\ncase before a three-judge panel instead of a jury. Id. Further, part of the rationale\nadvanced by the Post court in justifying counsel’s decision was that “[b]y pleading no\ncontest, [Post] would ‘avoid[ ] the ordeal’ of a guilt phase and have his sentence\n‘determined without the sentencing court hearing all of the adverse testimony that would\nbe produced at trial.’” Id. at 417 (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4–6.1\ncmt. (2d ed. 1980) (“The Defense Function”) (emphasis and third bracket added by\nPost)). Although Hodges’s defense team intended their decision to plead guilty to have\nthe same effect, in reality nearly all of the testimony that would have been introduced\nat trial was introduced during the penalty phase. The miscalculation was not a matter\nof a sound decision turning out to be a mistake in hindsight. Rather, the decision had no\nlegal support and was clearly a mistake in the first place. Hodges’s attorneys hoped that\npleading guilty would be a beneficial strategy, but had little sound reasoning behind this\nbelief. See Post, 621 F.3d at 428 (Cole, J., dissenting) (“I believe that the Constitution\nrequires attorneys to make strategic judgments based on something more concrete than\nunsubstantiated hope, especially when their client’s life hangs in the balance.”).\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                  Page 42\n\n\n        Nixon is also distinguishable. In Nixon, defense counsel was faced with\noverwhelming evidence of Nixon’s guilt. After a failed attempt to negotiate a guilty plea\nin exchange for the prosecutor dropping the death penalty, defense counsel “concluded\nthat the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in\nurging leniency during the penalty phase.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 181. Instead of advising\nhis client to enter a guilty plea, however, defense counsel decided to proceed to the guilt\nphase of trial, but to concede Nixon’s guilt to the jury. In opening statement, defense\ncounsel “acknowledged Nixon’s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.”\nId. at 182. The prosecution introduced extensive evidence of Nixon’s guilt during the\nguilt phase. Defense counsel “cross-examined [the prosecution’s] witnesses only when\nhe felt their statements needed clarification, . . . and he did not present a defense case.”\nId. at 183. He also objected to some evidence as unduly prejudicial. “In his closing\nargument, [defense counsel] again conceded Nixon’s guilt, and reminded the jury of the\nimportance of the penalty phase.” Id. (internal citation omitted). The jury found Nixon\nguilty, and the case proceeded to the penalty phase, at which defense counsel presented\ntestimony of a number of witnesses. Id. at 183–84. Importantly, “[t]he State presented\nlittle evidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence\nby reference.” Id. at 184.\n\n        The Nixon Court did not address the issue presented here. In fact, counsel in\nNixon did exactly what Hodges’s counsel now concede they should have done. In\napproving of Nixon’s attorney’s strategic decision, the Court discussed the downside to\npleading guilty in lieu of going to trial at the guilt phase:\n\n        As [defense counsel] determined here, pleading guilty without a\n        guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little\n        if any benefit for the defendant. See ABA Guidelines for the\n        Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty\n        Cases § 10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L.\n        Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (“If no written guarantee can be obtained that\n        death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be\n        extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.”).\n        Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the\n        likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt\n        during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 43\n\n\n       fresh in the jurors’ minds as they deliberate on the sentence. See [Gary]\n       Goodpaster, [The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death\n       Penalty Cases], 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 299, 331[,] 558–59, 560–61 [(1983)].\n\n543 U.S. at 191 n.6 (citation altered). Had Hodges’s counsel acted as Nixon’s did by\nproceeding to trial and acknowledging guilt rather than pleading guilty, there would have\nbeen no constitutionally deficient performance.\n\n       Addressing Hodges’s Strickland claim, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\nreasoned:\n\n       Although it is true that the appellant ultimately gained nothing by\n       pleading guilty, the record persuasively demonstrates that the appellant\n       had little to gain by insisting upon a trial. It is undisputed that the\n       evidence against the appellant was overwhelming and that his chances of\n       acquittal were virtually non-existent. Indeed, in advising the appellant,\n       defense counsel was faced with two options: plead not guilty to the\n       indictment and face a full trial; or plead guilty to the indictment and face\n       limited evidence in a sentencing hearing with an opportunity to trade on\n       his acceptance of his guilt and remorse. Confronted with the\n       overwhelming evidence of the appellant’s guilt, defense counsel advised\n       the appellant to plead guilty in the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency\n       during the sentencing phase. Defense counsel reasonably believed that\n       the jury would view the appellant’s guilty plea as an expression of\n       remorse warranting a less severe sentence than that imposed upon a\n       defendant who protests his innocence in the face of overwhelming\n       evidence of guilt. Moreover, by pleading guilty, the appellant eliminated\n       the presentation to the jury of all of the evidence available to establish\n       the appellant’s guilt of the murder. The hard callous facts behind the\n       offenses, in essence, were desensitized by avoiding the guilt phase. The\n       absence of an in-depth recitation of facts enabled the appellant to seek\n       some sympathy from the jury in the face of mitigating evidence.\n\nHodges v. State, 2000 WL 1562865, at *20 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000). The court\nreasonably pointed to Hodges’s counsel’s “hope of obtaining leniency during the\nsentencing phase” as a legitimate justification for pleading guilty. Id. However, the\nother reasons advanced in support of counsel’s decision lack support in the record. Most\nof the evidence of the circumstances of the murder was allowed in the penalty phase, and\nthe “hard callous facts behind the offense” were not “desensitized by avoiding the guilt\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 44\n\n\nphase.” Rather, those newly-presented facts were fresh in jurors’ minds when they\ndeliberated over imposition of the death penalty. As Gary Goodpaster observed:\n\n        [G]oing through a guilt phase trial helps to segregate and distance from\n        the sentencer the prosecution's strongest case against the defendant.\n        Were defendant simply to admit guilt and go straight to the penalty phase\n        trial, the prosecution at that time would undoubtedly present much of\n        what it otherwise would have presented during the guilt phase.\n\nGoodpaster, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 331. Hodges’s counsel did not consider the\nramifications of pleading guilty rather than proceeding to the guilt phase of the trial.\nMuch of the evidence they hoped to exclude was admissible under Tennessee law.\nCounsel admitted forgetting about the aggravated robbery charge, itself an aggravating\nfactor once Hodges pleaded guilty. Although I am mindful of the deference due to the\nstate court under AEDPA, I must conclude that the decision that counsel met minimum\nconstitutional standards involved an unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law.\n\n        B. Prejudice\n\n        In order to demonstrate prejudice, “the defendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty\nand would have insisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985).\n\n        The majority is correct that Hodges himself has never stated that, but for his\ncounsel’s deficient advice, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on\ngoing to trial. Additionally, Hodges’s habeas petition alleged that counsel’s advice to\nplead guilty constituted ineffective assistance, but did not specifically state that, had\ncounsel advised him otherwise, he would not have pleaded guilty. Hodges’s brief on\nappeal states simply that “where Mr. Hodges had nothing to gain by pleading guilty, he\ncertainly would not have entered a guilty plea if his lawyers had given him accurate\ninformation – in fact, had Mr. Hodges’s lawyers done their research, they wouldn’t have\nadvised Mr. Hodges to plead guilty at all.” (Opening Br. of Appellant 83.) However,\nthis is not the typical guilty plea case.\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 45\n\n\n        As the majority correctly notes, Hodges was not protesting his innocence leading\nup to trial. Rather, he had admitted his guilt in one or more television interviews and in\nletters to the prosecution and the trial court (against the advice of counsel). See J.A. at\n1704, 1786 (testimony of Donald Dawson). This certainly suggests that Hodges was\nready to plead guilty, and that he would have been convicted had he pleaded not guilty.\nThat, however, does not settle the issue. The issue here is not whether counsel were\ncompetent in their assessment and advice regarding the likelihood of conviction at trial,\nbut rather in advising that there were significant benefits to forgoing trial. See Griffin\nv. United States, 330 F.3d 733, 737 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that it is “easier to show\nprejudice in the guilty plea context” than in other contexts “because the claimant need\nonly show a reasonable probability that he would have pleaded differently”).\n\n        In Hill, the Court stated that “where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to\ninvestigate or discover potentially exculpatory evidence, the determination whether the\nerror ‘prejudiced’ the defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will\ndepend on the likelihood that discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to\nchange his recommendation as to the plea.” 474 U.S. at 59. Hodges’s claim here is not\nthat counsel failed to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory evidence that would\nhave led him to change his plea, so this language from Hill is not squarely on point.\nHodges’s claim is, however, that counsel failed to adequately consider the benefits of\ngoing to trial, and based their decision to advise him to plead guilty on an erroneous\nunderstanding of the consequences of a guilty plea at sentencing and insufficient legal\nresearch and investigation into the proper conduct of a capital case. This parallels the\nreasoning of Hill. Hodges’s two primary trial attorneys both testified that had they been\naware of the proper standards for death penalty representation and had they accurately\nconsidered the drawbacks to pleading guilty, they would have advised Hodges to go to\ntrial. J.A. at 1755, 1842. Thus, there is compelling evidence that counsel would have\n“changed [their] recommendation as to the plea.” Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\n\n        The ultimate question under Strickland and Hill is whether the defendant has\n“established the reasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 46\n\n\nhis counsel’s deficiency.” Premo v. Moore, 131 S. Ct. 733, 744 (2011) (emphasis\nadded). Although Hodges has not stated under oath that he would not have pleaded\nguilty if his counsel had advised against it, counsel’s testimony that they would have\nadvised him against pleading guilty establishes the requisite “reasonable probability” of\na different outcome. This is not a case where the decision to plead guilty or not guilty\nwas based on the likelihood of conviction versus acquittal. Rather, the choice was made\non the likely effect of the choice on the outcome of the penalty phase, and it is clear that\ncounsel’s advice in this regard was constitutionally ineffective. Had Hodges’s counsel\nadvised him to plead not guilty, there is no reason to think he would not have heeded\ntheir advice. His conduct during the penalty phase, including taking the stand to provide\ntestimony about his background in order to establish mitigating factors, demonstrates\nthat he preferred a sentence of life imprisonment over death. Had his counsel informed\nhim that the better strategy for achieving this outcome was to plead not guilty and go to\ntrial in the guilt phase, there is more than a reasonable probability that Hodges would\nhave taken their advice.\n\n        In sum, although the Supreme Court recently cautioned that “hindsight cannot\nsuffice for relief when counsel’s choices [to advise the defendant to plead guilty] were\nreasonable and legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would proceed,” and that\n“[t]here is a most substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffective assistance” in\nthat situation, Premo, 131 S. Ct. at 745, counsel’s choices here were based on\nunreasonable predictions about how the penalty phase would proceed, particularly about\nhow pleading guilty would affect the prosecution’s ability to present damaging evidence\nabout the details of the crime, and a complete failure to consider the benefits of going\nthrough the guilt phase. Further, Hodges has made an adequate showing of prejudice.\n\n        Because I conclude that the state court unreasonably applied Strickland, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III of the majority’s opinion and would grant Hodges’s\npetition for habeas corpus on this issue.\n\f",

BATCHELDER, Chief Judge. In 1992, a Tennessee jury convicted\nPetitioner-Appellant Henry Hodges of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\fNo. 09-5021       Hodges v. Colson                                                 Page 2\n\n\nThe state courts upheld the conviction and sentence on appeal and denied Hodges’s\npetition for post-conviction relief. Hodges then petitioned for federal habeas relief,\nwhich the district court denied. Hodges now appeals that denial to this court. For the\nfollowing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Hodges’s habeas petition.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the facts of this case as follows:\n\n       The defendant, Henry Eugene Hodges, entered a guilty plea and was\n       convicted of premeditated first-degree murder. Thereafter, the penalty\n       phase of the trial commenced. The State presented proof of the\n       circumstances of the offense through the testimony of Trina Brown, the\n       defendant’s fifteen-year-old girlfriend. Brown testified that one week\n       before the murder she and the twenty-four-year-old defendant, who were\n       living with the defendant’s brother in Smyrna, Tennessee, decided to\n       move to Florida. To get money for the move, Hodges, a male\n       homosexual prostitute, told Brown that he would rob and kill the next\n       person who propositioned him. Hodges discussed with Brown how the\n       crimes would be carried out. Hodges repeated these statements on May\n       14, 1990, the day of this murder.\n       On the night of May 14, Brown and Hodges went to Centennial Park in\n       Nashville. When the victim, Ronald Bassett, approached, Hodges talked\n       with him, and they left together in the victim’s vehicle and went to the\n       victim’s residence at 3133A, Parthenon Avenue, across from Centennial\n       Park. Ten or fifteen minutes later, Hodges returned to the park on foot,\n       and along with Brown, drove back to the victim’s residence in his own\n       car. Hodges told Brown to lie down in the backseat of the car so no one\n       could see her. When they arrived at the victim’s residence, Hodges told\n       Brown to wait in the car. After an unspecified period of time, Hodges\n       returned to the car, wearing gloves, and asked Brown to come into the\n       house. Brown testified that when she arrived, Bassett was lying face\n       down on the bed in his bedroom with a pillow over his head. Hodges had\n       bound his feet together with duct tape and had handcuffed his hands.\n       While Bassett lay helplessly, Brown and the defendant ransacked the\n       house searching for items of value. After obtaining the personal\n       identification number for the victim’s automatic teller card, Brown and\n       the defendant “took a break,” drank a coke, and discussed whether to kill\n       Bassett. Brown testified that she told Hodges to kill Bassett to prevent\n       their arrest. Hodges then went into the bedroom and, ignoring the\n       victim’s pleas not to kill him, strangled Bassett to death with a nylon\n\fNo. 09-5021      Hodges v. Colson                                                   Page 3\n\n\n      rope. Brown testified that she heard Bassett moan and make a choking\n      sound and that it took about five minutes for Bassett to die.\n      In an attempt to remove any fingerprints, the defendant wiped off various\n      items in the residence. After turning the air conditioner in Bassett’s\n      bedroom on high to prevent discovery of the body, Hodges and Brown\n      left the victim’s residence, taking the victim’s automobile and several\n      items of personal property, including jewelry, a gun, and a VCR. After\n      using Bassett’s automatic teller card to withdraw the twenty-four-hour\n      maximum of four hundred dollars from his account, the pair returned to\n      the house of the defendant’s brother and went to bed. The next day,\n      having learned that the victim’s body had been discovered, Brown and\n      the defendant abandoned the victim’s car in rural Rutherford County and\n      drove to Georgia in their own car. They were eventually arrested in\n      North Carolina. Items of the victim’s personal property were found in\n      their possession at this time. Also, the defendant’s fingerprints were\n      found on items inside Bassett’s home, and Brown had been photographed\n      withdrawing money with Bassett’s automatic teller card.\n      Testifying for the State at the sentencing hearing, Dr. Charles Harlan, the\n      chief medical examiner for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson\n      County, confirmed that Bassett had died from ligature strangulation. Dr.\n      Harlan opined that Bassett would have remained alive and conscious for\n      at least three and perhaps as long as five minutes during the\n      strangulation. Harlan also found abrasions on the victim’s wrists\n      consistent with handcuffs.\n      The State proved that the defendant had been convicted of armed\n      robbery, attempted kidnaping and robbery in Hamilton County in 1984.\n      The State also established that the defendant had been convicted of\n      murder in Fulton County, Georgia, in July 1990. The record reveals that\n      the Georgia killing occurred when the defendant and Brown arrived in\n      Atlanta after murdering Bassett. Hodges made arrangements with a man\n      to engage in homosexual acts for an agreed price. Hodges accompanied\n      the man to his motel room, but when the man was unable to pay the\n      agreed price, Hodges murdered him.\n      In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of\n      his mother, his brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist.\n      This proof showed that the defendant was the next to youngest of his\n      mother’s five sons. His mother and father were not married. His father\n      was actually married to another woman, but engaged in what one of the\n      witnesses described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother\n      for eighteen years. The defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother\n      and was strict with the defendant’s brothers, three of whom were the\n      children of another man. The defendant, however, was his father’s\n\fNo. 09-5021      Hodges v. Colson                                                  Page 4\n\n\n      favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties forced the family to move\n      about frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family only\n      sporadically.\n      The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until\n      he was twelve years old. At that time, he began to associate with older\n      boys, sniff glue and gasoline, be truant from school, and run away from\n      home. He also engaged in sexual activities with his younger brother and\n      attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He became involved\n      with the juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in\n      Chattanooga.\n      Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that\n      a catalyst and major contributing cause of his delinquent and later\n      criminal behavior was his rape and sexual abuse by a stranger when he\n      was twelve years old. According to the defendant, he accepted a\n      stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from\n      his home on Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges\n      home, the stranger drove Hodges to his home and raped him. Fearing\n      rejection by his homophobic father and driven by guilt, the defendant\n      told no one of this incident until he was arrested in 1990.\n      Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an\n      antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and substance\n      (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated by a subconscious desire for\n      revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was twelve,\n      coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was\n      engaged in homosexual prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic]\n      sister-in-law shortly before the killing that he was a homosexual\n      prostitute. The defense also introduced testimony that Brown dominated\n      and manipulated the defendant.\n      In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and\n      Dr. Leonard Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the\n      defendant and concluded that he suffered from an antisocial personality\n      disorder. They described persons with this disorder as having “no\n      conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest and\n      untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and\n      . . . willing to use any means to get what they want, no matter who it\n      hurts.” While acknowledging the complicated factors involved in\n      antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts discounted the\n      singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in\n      causing the defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the\n      defendant “was in complete control of his behavior” and not suffering\n      from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v.

Hodges failed to brief the remaining claims for\nwhich the district court granted a COA and, therefore, has waived them. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 28(a)(9)(A); Landrum v.

Restrictions on Voir Dire\n\n         Hodges alleges that he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury when the\ntrial court refused to allow his attorneys to ask prospective jurors whether they could\nconsider a life sentence for a defendant with a prior conviction for murder. Specifically,\ndefense counsel repeatedly attempted to ask the following question or a variation\nthereof: “Could you impose a life sentence for somebody who has been convicted of\nfirst degree murder twice?” The trial court repeatedly sustained the prosecution’s\nobjections to the question.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                                 Page 8\n\n\n       Hodges raised this claim on direct appeal. The Tennessee Court of Criminal\nAppeals rejected it, finding that each juror was asked and allowed to answer questions\nabout whether he could follow the law, consider a life sentence, and weigh the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">301443</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. The court\nalso found that a prospective juror could not answer the question “without knowing more\nabout the facts surrounding the case,” and that the question impermissibly sought “to\nobtain a pledge from the prospective juror.” Id. The district court found that the state\ncourt’s decision was not an unreasonable application of federal law, agreeing with the\nstate appellate court that Hodges’s questions improperly sought to commit the jurors to\nan opinion before hearing all of the evidence.\n\n       The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a trial by an impartial\njury.

A state court’s refusal to pose “constitutionally compelled”\nquestions merits habeas relief. Mu’Min v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112604\"><a href=\"/opinion/112604/mumin-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425–26 (1991).\nQuestions are constitutionally compelled only if “the trial court’s failure to ask these\nquestions . . . render[s] the defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair.” Id.\n\n       Hodges relies primarily on Morgan in support of his position. In Morgan, the\ntrial court did not permit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors the following\nquestion: “If you found [the defendant] guilty, would you automatically vote to impose\nthe death penalty no matter what the facts are?” Morgan, 504 U.S. at 723. The Supreme\nCourt held that general questions about following the law were not enough and that it\nwas error to exclude a more specific question tailored to identify jurors “who would\nalways impose death following conviction [of a capital offense].” Id. at 733, 735\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ determination that the trial court’s\nrestrictions on voir dire were permissible was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable\napplication of federal law. The trial court allowed defense counsel to ask the Morgan\nquestion, i.e., whether there was an aggravating circumstance that would cause her\n\fNo. 09-5021             Hodges v. Colson                                                             Page 9\n\n\nautomatically to impose the death penalty. In fact, the trial court went beyond that and\nalso allowed defense counsel to ask prospective jurors whether they could impose a life\nsentence on a defendant who had a prior conviction for a violent felony.1 Only when\ndefense counsel sought to get even more specific—asking whether a prospective juror\ncould impose a life sentence on a defendant who had a prior first-degree murder\nconviction—did the trial court restrict questioning.\n\n         This circuit has held that voir dire questions about how a potential juror would\nvote if given specific examples of aggravating or mitigating evidence are not\nconstitutionally compelled under Morgan. In Dennis, 354 F.3d at 523, the petitioner\nalleged that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by refusing to permit him to\nask prospective jurors about specific mitigating factors, including age, lack of prior\ncriminal history, and environment. We held that the Ohio Supreme Court’s conclusion\nthat the trial court allowed adequate questioning was “not an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the record” and was not “contrary to United States Supreme Court\nprecedent.” Id. at 525. We noted that the trial court had allowed the petitioner’s counsel\nto ask prospective jurors about mitigating factors in general: whether or not they could\nconsider mitigating factors and return a life sentence; whether they could follow the law;\nand whether any of the jury panel had strong feelings about psychological evidence\nconcerning upbringing, discipline, and lack of discipline. Id. at 524–26.\n\n         Similarly, in Bedford v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1208711\"><a href=\"/opinion/1208711/bedford-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2009), we rejected the\npetitioner’s claim that the trial court improperly limited the scope of voir dire by\nprohibiting counsel from asking questions that sought to elicit prospective jurors’ views\non the petitioner’s specific case. We noted that the trial court “drew the line at questions\n\n\n         1\n            In one instance, defense counsel asked if a prospective juror could consider mitigating evidence\nfor a defendant who had been previously convicted of a violent felony (as opposed to a previous conviction\nfor first-degree murder). The juror answered “[p]robably not” and was subsequently excluded for cause.\nHodges claims the exclusion of this juror “proves the fundamental unfairness of the trial court’s restrictions\n[on voir dire].” Pet.’s Br. at 69. We disagree for at least two reasons. First, the question posed to that\njuror contemplated a conviction for any violent felony, which is different from a question asking about a\nspecific violent felony actually at issue in the trial (e.g., first-degree murder). Second, the trial court’s\nexclusion of that juror on the basis of her answer to that specific question does nothing whatsoever to\nsuggest that the trial court was constitutionally compelled to allow the excluded questions, which focused\non first-degree murder, not violent felonies in general. Accordingly, despite Hodges’s vehement\narguments to the contrary, the exclusion of that juror does not provide compelling support for his position.\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 10\n\n\nthat sought to elicit the jurors’ views on [the petitioner’s] specific case—but many\njudges understandably (and properly) would do the same thing to prevent the lawyers\nfrom previewing their case through voir dire.” Id. at 232 (emphasis added). Ultimately\nwe concluded that the restrictions on voir dire “did not render the process fundamentally\nunfair.    [The restrictions] reflect instead a reasonable effort to enable adequate\nexploration of juror biases (on the one hand) while preventing counsel from extracting\ncommitments from individual jurors as to the way they would vote (on the other).” Id.\n(citing Dennis, 354 F.3d at 523–25).\n\n          Other circuits agree that Morgan does not compel a trial court to allow questions\nabout how a potential juror would vote if given specific examples of aggravating or\nmitigating evidence. See Richmond v. Polk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786902\"><a href=\"/opinion/786902/earl-richmond-jr-v-marvin-l-polk-warden-central-prison-raleigh/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2004); United States\nv.

In Richmond,\nthe Fourth Circuit addressed a claim functionally identical to the one presented here by\nHodges. There, the defendant sought to ask potential jurors “if . . . knowing that [the\ndefendant] had a previous first-degree murder conviction, they could still consider\nmitigating circumstances . . . in determining what their ultimate recommendation as to\nlife or death is going to be.” Richmond, 375 F.3d at 316. The trial court denied\ncounsel’s request to ask the question “on the basis that it was a ‘stakeout’ question aimed\nat determining what prospective jurors would do if presented with a certain state of\nevidence.” Id. The North Carolina Supreme Court agreed and affirmed. Id. at 329–30.\nThe Fourth Circuit held that the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision “was neither\ncontrary to nor an unreasonable application of Morgan.” Id. at 330 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It reasoned:\n\n          Morgan does not require that a capital defendant be allowed to determine\n          at voir dire what a prospective juror’s sentencing decision will be if\n          presented with a specific state of evidence or circumstances. Rather,\n          Morgan requires that a capital defendant be afforded an adequate\n          opportunity at voir dire to identify prospective jurors who, even prior to\n          the State’s case in chief, have predetermined to impose the death penalty.\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 11\n\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and formatting omitted).\n\n        We agree with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Richmond, and we hereby\nreaffirm our own holdings in Dennis and Bedford. Trial courts have “a great deal” of\ndiscretion in conducting voir dire. Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729. Morgan simply does not\nrequire a trial court to permit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors how they would\nvote assuming the existence of particular mitigating or aggravating circumstances, which\nis essentially what defense counsel sought to do here.            Morgan allows for the\nidentification and exclusion of jurors who are biased for or against the death penalty\nbefore being presented with any evidence and would always vote in accordance with\ntheir biases without regard to the particular facts of the particular case. Id. at 733 (“Were\nvoir dire not available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner’s challenge for cause\nagainst those prospective jurors who would always impose death following conviction,\nhis right not to be tried by such jurors would be rendered . . . nugatory.”) (emphasis in\noriginal)). When defense counsel asks questions about the specific aggravating and/or\nmitigating factors actually at issue in a case, defense counsel is no longer attempting to\nidentify members of the venire who would always vote for the death penalty; rather,\ndefense counsel is attempting to preview how prospective jurors will vote given the\nspecific facts of the individual case, and Morgan does not require a trial court to allow\nsuch previews.\n\n        Here, defense counsel was permitted to ask the Morgan question and was even\npermitted to go beyond that and ask questions such as whether a juror could impose a\nlife sentence on a defendant with previous violent-felony convictions. That was easily\nsufficient to comply with Morgan’s requirement that a capital defendant be allowed to\nidentify prospective jurors who would “always” vote for death. See id. The trial court\nexcluded only questions concerning specific aggravating factors actually at issue in the\ncase (namely, a previous conviction for first-degree murder). Accordingly, the decision\nof the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirming the trial court’s restrictions on\nvoir dire was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law, and\nHodges is not entitled to habeas relief on this claim.\n\fNo. 09-5021             Hodges v. Colson                                                            Page 12\n\n\nII.      Juror Misconduct\n\n         Hodges claims that his death sentence violates his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights because juror Leroy Thompson engaged in misconduct by allegedly\nmisinforming the trial court that he would be able to sit on the jury but then voting for\nthe death penalty only because he was in pain due to arthritis and wanted to end\ndeliberations. Hodges included Thompson’s alleged misconduct as a ground for his\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing. Hodges concedes that he never raised this matter in\nthe state courts and that it is therefore procedurally defaulted, but he contends that he can\nestablish cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default.\n\n         Whether a petitioner’s federal habeas claim is barred by procedural default is a\nquestion that we review de novo.2 Abela v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787456\"><a href=\"/opinion/787456/kevin-mark-abela-v-william-martin-director-michigan-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 922 (6th Cir. 2004).\n“[S]tate prisoners must give the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any\nconstitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State’s established appellate\nreview process.” O’Sullivan v.

See Hicks, 377 F.3d at 553.\n\n       Hodges no longer has any state court remedies to exhaust. Under Tennessee’s\npost-conviction law, a prisoner challenging a conviction may file only one petition\nattacking a single judgment. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-102(c). A prisoner may file a\nmotion to reopen his first post-conviction petition only if his claim stems from a newly\nestablished constitutional right that applies retroactively, relies on scientific evidence\nthat he is actually innocent, or involves a sentence enhanced because of a previous\nconviction that has been declared invalid. Fletcher v. Tennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060986\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060986/fletcher-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n380–81 (Tenn. 1997) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-217(a) (1996 Supp.)). Hodges’s\njuror misconduct claim does not fall within any of these exceptions. Because he failed\nto present the claim to the state courts and no state court remedies remain available, the\nclaim is procedurally defaulted. See O’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 848.\n\n       At the district court, Hodges argued that various causes could excuse his\nprocedural default, including ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, ineffective\nassistance of post-conviction counsel, reliance on Thompson’s responses in voir dire,\nand Hodges’s inability to locate Thompson before the post-conviction evidentiary\nhearing. Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute cause for a procedural default.\nSee Carrier, 477 U.S. at 492. However, “an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\nasserted as cause for the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally\ndefaulted.” Edwards v. Carpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118357\"><a href=\"/opinion/118357/edwards-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (2000). In post-conviction\nproceedings, Hodges raised a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\nregarding Thompson’s competence. He did not claim that appellate counsel were\nineffective for failing to raise the claim that Thompson engaged in misconduct.\n\fNo. 09-5021            Hodges v. Colson                                                            Page 14\n\n\nAccordingly, Hodges cannot rely on ineffective assistance of counsel to establish cause\nto excuse his procedural default.\n\n         Nor can Hodges rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to\nestablish cause to excuse his default, even if this holding is not so clear-cut as it once\nwould have been. Historically, the federal courts have held that there is no constitutional\nright to an attorney in post-conviction proceedings, and that ineffective assistance of\npost-conviction counsel therefore cannot establish cause for procedural default.\nSee Carpenter, 529 U.S. at 450–53; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752; Landrum, 625 F.3d at\n919. But the Supreme Court recently held in Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012),\nthat there is a “narrow exception” to Coleman: “Inadequate assistance of counsel at\ninitial review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a procedural default of a\nclaim of ineffective assistance at trial.”                Id. at 1315 (emphasis added).                This\n“equitable”—as opposed to constitutional—exception is premised on Coleman itself, a\ncase in which the Court declined to address the situation in which “state collateral review\nis the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.” Coleman,\n501 U.S. at 755. The Martinez Court held that in such situations ineffective assistance\nof post-conviction counsel may be raised as cause to excuse procedural default because\n“the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s direct appeal\nas to the ineffective assistance claim.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1317.\n\n         The Court in Martinez purported to craft a narrow exception3 to Coleman. We\nwill assume that the Supreme Court meant exactly what it wrote: “Coleman held that\nan attorney’s negligence in a postconviction proceeding does not establish cause, and\nthis remains true except as to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel at trial.” Id. at 1316 (emphasis added). The Supreme\nCourt further insisted:\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           We are reminded of one jurist’s statement, made in a different context, that “[e]xceptions to\ncategorical rules, once created, are difficult to cabin; the logic of the new rule, like water, finds its own\nlevel, and it’s hard to keep it from covering far more than anticipated.” United States v. Alvarez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667 (9th Cir. 2011) (Kozinsky, C.J., concurring).\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 15\n\n\n       The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances\n       recognized here. The holding in this case does not concern attorney\n       errors in other kinds of proceedings, including appeals from\n       initial-review collateral proceedings, second or successive collateral\n       proceedings, and petitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate\n       courts. It does not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond\n       the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of\n       ineffective assistance at trial, even though that initial-review collateral\n       proceeding may be deficient for other reasons. In addition, the limited\n       nature of the qualification to Coleman adopted here reflects the\n       importance of the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel and\n       Arizona’s decision to bar defendants from raising ineffective-assistance\n       claims on direct appeal. Our holding here addresses only the\n       constitutional claims presented in this case, where the State barred the\n       defendant from raising the claims on direct appeal.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted; emphases added).\n\n       We will address Hodges’s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a\ndifferent section, but here he claims ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as\ncause to excuse default of his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for\nfailure to raise the juror misconduct issue on direct appeal. Under Martinez’s\nunambiguous holding our previous understanding of Coleman in this regard is still the\nlaw—ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel cannot supply cause for\nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See, e.g.,\nLandrum, 625 F.3d at 919. Moreover, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(i) bars a claim of ineffective\nassistance of post-conviction counsel as a separate ground for relief, see Martinez,\n132 S. Ct. at 1320, and Hodges has not presented any evidence to justify review of his\nclaim in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at\n495–96.\n\n       Additionally, Hodges cannot rely on statements made by Thompson at voir dire\nor difficulties in locating Thompson during state post-conviction proceedings to establish\ncause. Thompson discussed his pain-causing arthritis at voir dire on January 27, 1992.\nThe verdict form is dated January 30, 1992. Hodges filed his petition for state post-\nconviction relief on December 11, 1997. He first attempted to locate Thompson in or\naround June 1998. Hodges gives no explanation whatsoever as to why nearly six-and-a-\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 16\n\n\nhalf years elapsed between his conviction and his first attempt to locate Thompson.\nMoreover, Hodges gives no explanation as to why or how he was able to locate\nThompson for the federal habeas proceeding but not for the state post-conviction\nproceeding.\n\n          “[T]he existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on\nwhether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense\nimpeded counsel’s efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.” Carrier, 477 U.S.\nat 479. For nearly six-and-a-half years, Hodges was aware that Thompson had arthritis\nand may have been in pain during jury deliberations but failed to seek him out. The fact\nthat Hodges did not even attempt to locate Thompson until it was nearly too late, and\nthen could not find him in time to present his testimony to the state court, is not an\nobjective factor external to the defense sufficient to establish cause to excuse procedural\ndefault.\n\n          Finally, Hodges has not presented any evidence that review of this claim is\nnecessary in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See id. at 495–96.\nThis exception has been applied only when a habeas petitioner has demonstrated that he\nis actually innocent. See Carter v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793892\"><a href=\"/opinion/793892/clarence-carter-v-betty-mitchell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing\nCarrier, 477 U.S. at 496). Hodges has not presented new evidence of his innocence nor\nhas he even argued that he is actually innocent.\n\n          Accordingly, Hodges is unable to establish the cause necessary to excuse his\nprocedural default of this claim. It was therefore appropriate for the district court to\ndeny both an evidentiary hearing and habeas relief on this claim because the claim is\nbarred.\n\nIII.      Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Plea Phase\n\n          Hodges argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by advising him\nto plead guilty; that because of their deficient performance, his guilty plea was neither\nknowing, voluntary, nor intelligent; and that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s\nperformance. Hodges claims that his lawyers mistakenly believed that his pleading\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 17\n\n\nguilty would prohibit the state from introducing any evidence relating to the facts of the\nmurder; that his lawyers forgot that if he pled guilty to the aggravated robbery charge,\nHodges would immediately become death eligible; and that he would not have pled\nguilty if his lawyers had given him accurate information.\n\n       Hodges failed to appeal the plea-invalidity claim to the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals, and referred to it only in the final page of his brief without citing to\nthe record or any legal authority. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals considered\nthe issue waived and declined to address it, relying on Tenn. Crim. App. R. 10(b) and\nTenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7). See Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *32. To the extent that\nit is a separate claim, the plea-invalidity claim is procedurally defaulted.\nSee Middlebrooks v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174527\"><a href=\"/opinion/174527/middlebrooks-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535–36 (6th Cir. 2010). Hodges cannot rely on\nineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to excuse the default; neither has he\npresented any evidence to justify review of his claim in order to prevent a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96. Accordingly, the plea-\ninvalidity claim is barred, and this court will review only the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.\n\n       Hodges raised the ineffective assistance claim in his state post-conviction\npetition. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing and took testimony from Hodges’s\ntrial counsel. Hodges v. Tennessee, No. M1999-00516-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 20, 2000). The Court of Criminal Appeals summarized\nthe evidence presented as follows:\n\n       At the post-conviction hearing, Dawson [defense counsel at trial]\n       testified that the decision to enter a guilty plea was made the weekend\n       prior to trial when it was determined that “there was no way we were\n       going to convince anybody that Mr. Hodges didn't kill the victim in this\n       matter.” He explained that, at that time, the defense team believed that\n       by entering a plea during the guilt phase of the trial, they would gain\n       credibility with the jury for the sentencing phase. The defense team also\n       hoped to surprise the State by entering the plea. In essence, the defense\n       team intended to disrupt the bifurcated nature of the trial, thereby\n       precluding the State from introducing evidence during the penalty phase\n       which the State had planned to introduce at the guilt phase.\n       Notwithstanding this reasoning, Dawson admitted that, although the\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                            Page 18\n\n\n       proof was overwhelming, in hindsight, they should have proceeded to\n       trial so that they could have begun introduction of their mitigation\n       theories. Michael Terry [defense counsel at trial] corroborated Dawson's\n       testimony regarding the appellant's guilty plea. He explained that the\n       plea was supposed to be “a demonstration of remorse for the jury.”\n       However, he agrees that the decision was a mistake and that they should\n       have at a least “pitched a fight.” [Hodges] did not testify at the\n       post-conviction hearing.\n\nId. The trial court held that counsel made an informed tactical decision to advise Hodges\nto plead guilty. Id.\n\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed that decision. It cited Hill\nv. Lockhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), for the proposition that the two-prong standard from\nStrickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), applies to ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims arising out of guilty plea proceedings. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*19–20. The court concluded that the advice to plead guilty was not “outside the range\nof competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.” Id. at *20. The court noted\nthe overwhelming evidence of guilt, the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency, the\nreasonable belief that the jury would view the guilty plea as an expression of remorse,\nand the elimination of the presentation to the jury of all of the evidence available of\nHodges’s guilt. Id. at *19.\n\n       The district court held that the state court’s conclusion that Hodges’s counsel\nmade a strategic decision to advise him to plead guilty was not unreasonable. The court\nnoted that Hodges’s counsel had done substantial work on the case before advising him\nto plead guilty; that counsel were experienced, aware of the state’s proof and the\nelements of the offenses charged; had the aid of three experts; and were impaired by\nHodges’s public statements admitting to several murders. The district court also found\nthat Hodges did not establish prejudice because Hodges did not testify at his post-\nconviction hearing and thus did not say that he would not have pled guilty but for the\nadvice of counsel.\n\n       After a careful review of the record, we agree with the district court. The state\ncourt’s determination that defense counsel’s performance was not deficient was not\n\fNo. 09-5021           Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 19\n\n\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. Moreover, even if we were\nto find deficient performance, Hodges has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the\nperformance.4\n\n        To establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Hodges must show that (1)\nhis counsel’s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced\nthe defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687–88. An attorney’s performance is deficient if\nit is objectively unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. Id. at 688. “[A]\ncourt must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the\npresumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered\nsound trial strategy.” Id. at 689. The test for prejudice is whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings\nwould have been different. Id. at 694. To show prejudice in the guilty-plea context, a\ndefendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors,\nhe would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.”\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59. “[W]here the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise the\ndefendant of a potential affirmative defense to the crime charged, the resolution of the\n‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely on whether the affirmative defense likely would\nhave succeeded at trial.” Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court has recently noted that “[e]stablishing that a state court’s\napplication of Strickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult.”\nHarrington v. Richter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182992\"><a href=\"/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788 (2011). “The standards created by Strickland\nand § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is\ndoubly so.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Therefore, “[w]hen\n§ 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The\n\n\n\n        4\n          We note that two recent Supreme Court cases—Lafler v. Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625833\"><a href=\"/opinion/625833/lafler-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Colson                                                Page 20\n\n\nquestion is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s\ndeferential standard.” Id.\n\n        A.      Performance\n\n        Using the “doubly” deferential standards of § 2254(d) and Strickland, we\nconclude that the state court’s determination that defense counsel’s performance was not\ndeficient was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law. Trial\ncounsel advised Hodges to plead guilty because of the overwhelming evidence of his\nguilt, to give the defense credibility, to limit the proof the prosecution could present, and\nto show Hodges’s remorse.\n\n        The Supreme Court has explicitly approved using the American Bar Association\n(“ABA”) Guidelines on attorney performance in effect at the time of a defendant’s trial\nas “guides to determining what is reasonable” performance by counsel. See, e.g., Padilla\nv. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1723/padilla-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, “ABA Guidelines are not\n‘inexorable commands’; rather, they are ‘only guides to what reasonableness means, not\nits definition.’” Post v. Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"175168\"><a href=\"/opinion/175168/post-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bobby v.\nVan Hook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (2009)) (some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        The ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of Hodges’s trial contemplated\nnegotiated guilty pleas only where the defendant is assured of a sentence less than death.\nABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty\nCases (“ABA Guidelines”), § 11.6.1 (1989). “If no written guarantee can be obtained\nthat death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely\nreluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.” Id. § 11.6.3 cmt.\n\n        Courts also find that a defendant has little to gain from pleading guilty in a\ncapital case, even when the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. “[P]leading guilty [in a\ncapital case] without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence\nholds little if any benefit for the defendant.” Florida v. Nixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 n.6\n(2004) (citing ABA Guidelines § 10.9.2 cmt. (rev.ed. 2003)). The Nixon Court noted\nthat pleading guilty “increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 21\n\n\nevidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime\nare fresh in the jurors’ minds as they deliberate on the sentence.” Id. Nevertheless, the\nCourt concluded that “counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress\nthe jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.” Id. at 192\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       This court has also recently decided a similar, but distinguishable, case. In Post,\n621 F.3d at 415–18, a pre-Richter case, we addressed whether trial counsel’s advice to\nenter a no-contest plea and to submit the penalty phase to a three-judge panel rather than\na jury was objectively reasonable under Strickland. Using de novo review, we\nconcluded that the defendant’s weak mitigation case made the decision reasonable,\nnoting that “[the defendant’s] counsel were between a rock and a hard place in\ndetermining the best way to spare him a death sentence, given the overwhelming\nevidence of his guilt, his numerous confessions, and his refusal to plead guilty.” Id at\n418. We held that although the no-contest plea resulted in the defendant’s being\n“sentenced by judges, not jurors, and by three persons rather than twelve,” the strategy\nwas professionally reasonable because the sentencing judges could have viewed the no-\ncontest plea as a mitigating factor (although ultimately they did not). Id. at 417.\n\n       Trial counsel’s advice to plead guilty here was questionable. Defense counsel\nhoped that Hodges’s pleading guilty would accomplish the following:               (1) gain\ncredibility with the jury, (2) demonstrate Hodges’s remorse, (3) limit the evidence\npresented to the jury, and (4) surprise the prosecution and thereby limit the effectiveness\nof its penalty case. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals noted that although the\ngoals of counsel were reasonable, Hodges “ultimately gained nothing by pleading\nguilty.” Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20. For example, despite counsel’s attempt to\nlimit the evidence presented to the jury, a vast majority of what they hoped to keep out\nwas allowed in. Trina Brown testified that Hodges planned to rob and kill the next\nperson who propositioned him, and that he discussed how to carry out the crimes. She\nalso told the jury that Hodges bound the victim’s hands and feet and that, after she and\nHodges ransacked the victim’s apartment, Hodges strangled the victim, who was\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 22\n\n\nbegging for his life. Hodges, 944 S.W.2d at 349. Police officers testified that the\nvictim’s belongings were found in Hodges’s possession when he was arrested, that\nHodges’s fingerprints were found in the victim’s home, and that Brown was\nphotographed using the victim’s ATM card. Id. at 350.\n\n        Defense counsel did successfully limit the prosecution’s cross-examination of\nHodges; the State was permitted to ask questions only about his personal history, and not\nabout the circumstances of the offense. Id. at 350 n.6. However, the same result could\nhave been achieved by putting on a reasonable doubt defense and having Hodges testify\nonly during the sentencing hearing. This is also true of defense counsel’s goals of\ngaining credibility with the jury and showing remorse.\n\n        Moreover, defense attorney Dawson testified in the state post-conviction\nproceeding that the defense team “never sat down and did an analysis of what are the\nbenefits of going to trial, what are the deficits and where did that lead us.” He also\ntestified that when the defense team advised Hodges to plead guilty, he had “totally\nforgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated robbery; a conviction on\nthat count constituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase.\n\n        However, trial counsel also acknowledged that the evidence of Hodges’s guilt\nwas overwhelming. As counsel explained during the state post-conviction proceeding,\ndespite their advice that he should not speak with reporters, Hodges participated in a pre-\ntrial television series in which he gave interviews “describing himself as a serial killer.”\nAttorney Dawson described the difficulties that arose from representing such a client:\n“We had a client that was confessing to the public on eight murders. And he had written\nto the court; he had written to the prosecutor, a confession to the case that we had to try.\nIt looked pretty dismal.” Trial counsel summarized the evidence against Hodges:\nHodges made inculpatory statements to police, prosecutors, the trial court, and television\nreporters; his fingerprints were at the scene of the crime; he had items from the victim’s\nhouse with him when he was arrested; Trina Brown gave a statement implicating him;\nthere were photos of Brown using the victim’s bank card; and Brown’s fingerprints were\non the victim’s card.\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 23\n\n\n        The defense team talked to Hodges about the decision to plead guilty and\nreviewed the guilty plea form with him. Hodges thanked his attorneys for their work and\nnever complained about their representation.\n\n        If it were our task to determine whether trial counsel’s performance was deficient\nbecause they advised Hodges to plead guilty, the decision would be a more difficult one.\nThe ABA Guidelines at the time of the plea contemplated guilty pleas in capital cases\nonly in exchange for a guarantee from the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.\nHere, no such exchange was made, and Hodges gained little—if anything—from his\nplea.\n\n        However, the “ABA Guidelines are not inexorable commands,” Post, 621 F.3d\nat 418 (internal quotation marks omitted), and our task is not to determine whether trial\ncounsel’s performance was deficient. Rather, we must determine “whether there is any\nreasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Richter,\n131 S. Ct. at 788 (emphasis added). And here, as identified by the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals, there is a reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s\ndeferential standard. Although not directly on point, the considerations in this case are\nsimilar to those faced by this court in Post: “[C]ounsel were between a rock and a hard\nplace in determining the best way to spare [the defendant] a death sentence, given the\noverwhelming evidence of his guilt, [and] his numerous confessions.” 621 F.3d at 418.\nAnd in Post, we found that counsel’s actions were reasonable under a de novo standard\nof review, id., which is far less stringent than the “doubly” deferential standard that we\nmust apply here, see Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. Although there is some evidence that\ncounsel here failed to appreciate fully the impact of their decision, that is not material\nto the issue before us: whether there is “any reasonable argument” that counsel’s\nrecommendation to plead guilty satisfies Strickland. As the Supreme Court has stated,\n“[C]ounsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his\ncandor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 192.\n\n        Ultimately, the state court that addressed this issue concluded that, “[a]lthough\ndefense counsel’s strategy for avoiding the death penalty was thwarted, the decision to\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 24\n\n\npursue that particular strategy cannot be deemed incompetent.” Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20. Under the doubly deferential standard imposed by § 2254(d) and\nStrickland, we simply cannot say that conclusion is contrary to or involves an\nunreasonable application of federal law.\n\n       B.      Prejudice\n\n       Even if we did find that the state court’s decision on trial counsel’s performance\nwas unreasonable, we could not grant relief because Hodges has failed to establish\nprejudice. As noted above, to show prejudice in the guilty-plea context, a defendant\n“must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would\nnot have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.” Hill, 474\nU.S. at 59.\n\n       Because the state courts found that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient,\nthe state courts did not address the prejudice prong of the Strickland inquiry. We have\npreviously held that where a state court addresses only the performance prong of the\nStrickland inquiry, this court will review the prejudice prong de novo. See Morales v.\nMitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435226/morales-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (6th Cir. 2007). However, the Supreme Court’s decision in\nRichter requires us to apply AEDPA deference to our review of the prejudice prong even\nwhere—as here—the state court reviewed only the performance prong.\n\n       In Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 784, the Supreme Court stated,\n\n       Where a state court’s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the\n       habeas petitioner’s burden still must be met by showing there was no\n       reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief. This is so whether or\n       not the state court reveals which of the elements in a multipart claim it\n       found insufficient, for § 2254(d) applies when a “claim,” not a\n       component of one, has been adjudicated.\n\n(emphasis added). The Court went on to say, “[w]hen a federal claim has been presented\nto a state court and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed that the state\ncourt adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law\nprocedural principles to the contrary.” Id. at 784–85. Here, the state court did address\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 25\n\n\nHodges’s ineffective assistance of counsel “claim,” so AEDPA deference applies to the\nentire claim regardless of whether the state court explicitly addressed every\n“component” (i.e., the prejudice prong) of that claim. See id at 784.\n\n       Moreover, as a matter of logic, a finding that counsel’s performance was not\ndeficient implicitly, but unequivocally, encompasses a finding that the performance did\nnot prejudice the defendant. Indeed, it would be nonsensical to argue that a performance\ndeemed to be constitutionally sufficient nevertheless prejudiced the defendant. It must\nbe assumed that a state court’s decision that performance was not deficient includes a\ndecision that the performance was not prejudicial. Richter explicitly holds that a state\ncourt decision is entitled to AEDPA deference, even if the state court has not given\nreasons for that decision, “in the absence of any indication” that state-law procedural\nprinciples were responsible for the state court’s decision. Id. at 785.\n\n       Here, the state court adjudicated Hodges’s ineffective assistance claim, and there\nwas no indication that state-law procedural principles were responsible for the state\ncourt’s decision.   Accordingly, we must review the entire claim under AEDPA\ndeference, including the prejudice prong. Our task is therefore to determine whether\nthere was “[any] reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.” Id. at 784.\n\n       We find that there was. In Hill, 474 U.S. at 59, the Supreme Court held that in\nthe context of a challenge to a guilty plea, to establish prejudice a defendant need only\nshow that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel’s errors, he would\nnot have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.” The Court went on\nto give two examples. First, it noted that where the alleged error involves failure to\ninvestigate or discover exculpatory information, “the determination of whether the error\n‘prejudiced’ the defendant . . . will depend in large part on a prediction whether the\nevidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.” Id. Second, it noted that\nwhere the alleged error involves a failure to advise the defendant of possible affirmative\ndefenses, “the resolution of the ‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely on whether the\naffirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.” Id. It is therefore clear that\nin determining whether a defendant has shown prejudice, a court must predict whether\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 26\n\n\ncorrection of the deficient performance might have enabled the defendant to succeed at\ntrial. “[T]hese predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be\nmade objectively, without regard for the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.”\nId. at 59–60.\n\n       This court has previously noted that “testimony, though self-serving, may be\nenough by itself to satisfy the prejudice prong.” Miller v. Straub, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778667\"><a href=\"/opinion/778667/cortez-miller-v-dennis-m-straub-warden-kermit-eldridge-haynes-v-luella/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (6th\nCir. 2002). In Miller, the defendants testified at a hearing that they entered their guilty\npleas with hesitation and would not have pled guilty but for counsel’s advice. Id. The\ncourt also noted that one of the defendants presented, in the form of testimony from his\ntrial counsel, “additional evidence that, with competent assistance, he would have pled\nnot guilty.” Id. at 582. Trial counsel testified that the defendant “pled guilty only\nreluctantly,” and the court concluded that “the fact that [trial counsel] had to prevail\nupon [the defendant] to plead guilty tends to corroborate [the defendant’s] testimony that\nhe would have pled not guilty.” Id. The court concluded that the defendants’\n“testimony, along with reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances of this\ncase,” established prejudice under Hill. Id. at 583.\n\n       In Hodges’s case, particularly under the doubly deferential standards of AEDPA\nand Strickland, we cannot conclude that Hodges has established a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s advice, he would not have pled guilty. In fact, the only evidence\nconcerning this issue appears in Hodges’s Verified Amended Petition for Post\nConviction Relief filed on March 24, 1998. There, notably, Hodges did not say that had\nhe had better advice he would not have pled guilty. Rather, his statement was:\n\n       Had trial counsel performed the above investigations and informed\n       Petitioner of the result of those investigations, and had counsel timely\n       communicated with Petitioner and given him the above advice, a\n       reasonable probability exists that Petitioner would not have pleaded\n       guilty to all counts in the indictment, but, rather, would have insisted on\n       going to trial.\n\fNo. 09-5021            Hodges v. Colson                                                           Page 27\n\n\nAt the end of the document, Hodges’s signature appears, verifying that the “foregoing\nallegations of fact are true and correct to the best of [his] information and belief.”5\n\n         In contrast to the defendants in Miller, Hodges has never personally testified\nabout his decision to plead guilty and whether he would have pled not guilty but for the\nadvice of counsel. Moreover, unlike in Miller, where “reasonable inferences from the\nfacts and circumstances” of the case suggested that the defendants would not have pled\nguilty but for advice of counsel, no such inferences exist here. To the contrary, any\ninferences that can be made make it clear that Hodges would have pled guilty regardless\nof what his counsel recommended. Leading up to trial, Hodges embraced his guilt. For\ninstance, against the advice of counsel, he participated in a pre-trial television series in\nwhich he gave interviews “describing himself as a serial killer.” Hodges also implicated\nhimself in letters to the court and prosecutor. Those simply are not the actions of a\ndefendant hoping to avoid a guilty plea, nor do they help establish a reasonable\nprobability that Hodges would have pled not guilty if so advised by counsel.\n\n         Furthermore, Hill instructs us to examine how competent counsel might have\ninfluenced the outcome of a hypothetical trial, see 474 U.S. at 59–60, and there is\nvirtually no chance that Hodges could have avoided convictions by proceeding to trial.\nAs has been discussed repeatedly, the evidence against Hodges was overwhelming, and\nhe only made the situation worse by corresponding with reporters, the court, and the\nprosecutor against the advice of his counsel. Similarly, we have no evidence or reason\nto believe that the penalty phase of trial would have proceeded differently had there first\nbeen a full guilt phase.\n\n         A self-serving statement, couched in exactly the terms of the Supreme Court’s\nstandard, and filed as a required part of Hodges’s verified petition for post-conviction\nrelief, cannot establish a reasonable probability that Hodges would have pled not guilty\nbut for the advice of counsel, where all objective evidence points unequivocally to the\ncontrary. Accordingly, it is clear that the state court had a reasonable basis for denying\n\n         5\n         We note that the verification oath and signature is required of all post-conviction petitions filed\nin Tennessee. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-204(e) (1997).\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                Page 28\n\n\nrelief on this claim. Hodges is not entitled to relief on his claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel at the plea phase.\n\nIV.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Sentencing Phase & Incompetency at\n        Trial\n\n        Hodges argues that the district court erred when it denied him an evidentiary\nhearing on his claims that he was incompetent at trial and that his trial counsel were\nineffective at sentencing. He also argues that the district court erred when it denied his\ncompetency and ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the merits.\n\n        Hodges failed to present his claim of incompetency at trial to the state courts, and\nhe no longer has any state court remedies to exhaust.

However, neither\nthe Supreme Court nor this court has adopted such a rule, and we decline to do so here.\nAs the Ninth Circuit noted in LaFlamme v.

Mar. 16, 2000), those courts that have held that substantive competency\nclaims cannot be procedurally defaulted appear to have conflated the distinct concepts\nof waiver and procedural default. Although it is true that substantive competency claims\ncannot be waived, Pate v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107184\"><a href=\"/opinion/107184/pate-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1966) (“it is contradictory to\nargue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly or intelligently ‘waive’\nhis right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial”), they can be\nprocedurally defaulted. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that, “unlike waiver, the\nprocedural default rule does not rely on the petitioner’s voluntary abandonment of a\nknown right, but only on the fact that the claim was rejected by the state court on\nindependent and adequate state grounds.” LaFlamme, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">757525</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (internal\nquotation marks and formatting omitted).

As we mentioned, the Supreme Court’s decision in Martinez puts yet\nanother wrinkle in the crushed velvet that is federal habeas corpus jurisprudence, but the\nMartinez rule is not implicated here. Martinez held that where the state courts do not\npermit ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims to be brought on direct appeal but\nrequire they be brought on collateral attack, ineffective assistance of collateral counsel\ncan provide cause to excuse procedural default. See Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1315–16.\nBut Tennessee does not require prisoners to bring ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nclaims on collateral attack—prisoners may bring them on direct appeal. See State v.\nHoneycutt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060440\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060440/state-v-honeycutt/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766 & n.6 (Tenn. 2001); State v.

Crim. App. 1992); State v. Smith, 2011 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 830, at\n*33–35 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 14, 2011). Tennessee’s system does not implicate the\nsame concerns as those that triggered the rule in Martinez because in Tennessee a\ncollateral proceeding is not “the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim\nof ineffective assistance at trial.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1320. And in any event, here\nHodges did not default an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim; he defaulted his\nclaim that he was not competent to stand trial. Accordingly, the Coleman rule still\napplies, and ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel may not provide cause to\nexcuse default of his competency claim. Because Hodges has not presented any\nevidence to justify review of his claim in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of\njustice, see Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96, the substantive competency claim is barred, and\nwe will review the ineffective assistance claim only to the extent that it concerns failure\nto investigate and present additional mitigating evidence.\n\n        In his state post-conviction petition, Hodges claimed that trial counsel were\nineffective for failing to investigate and present additional mitigating evidence.\nAccording to Hodges, his counsel should have obtained prison records that showed he\ntold a doctor that he was raped as a boy and should have interviewed additional people\n\fNo. 09-5021          Hodges v. Colson                                            Page 30\n\n\nwho were familiar with his background. Hodges also asserted that trial counsel failed\nto investigate evidence concerning the causes, effects, and treatment of substance abuse;\nfailed to adequately prepare him for his testimony; and failed to make effective use of\nexperts.      Hodges requested, and the trial court granted, $15,000 for mitigation\ninvestigation; but the trial court denied Hodges’s request for additional funds to hire a\ndrug and alcohol specialist, a mitigation specialist, and a fingerprint expert. At the\nevidentiary hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Hodges’s trial counsel, a\nclinical sociologist who helped prepare Hodges’s mitigation case, the Tennessee District\nPublic Defender’s Conference chief counsel, and a mitigation specialist retained for the\npost-conviction proceeding. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4–*12. The trial court\ndenied Hodges’s petition.\n\n         The appellate court affirmed, finding that Hodges had not presented any evidence\nin post-conviction proceedings that was substantially different from the proof introduced\nat the penalty phase. Id. at *27. The court found that the experts presented at the\npenalty phase, with one exception, were in possession of the same records about Hodges\nused by the post-conviction mitigation specialist, and that additional evidence from\nfurther mitigation investigation would have been cumulative to the evidence obtained\nby trial counsel before sentencing. Id. It stated, “[g]iven the records presently before\nthis court, we conclude that trial counsel adequately investigated the appellant’s\nbackground and presented a case in mitigation that was supported by the information\nintroduced.” Id. The appellate court also held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by denying Hodges the additional funds he requested because his post-\nconviction counsel were capable of presenting the available mitigation information\nwithout expert assistance.

Section 2254(e)(2) states that, with a few\nexceptions, “[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State\ncourt proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim.” Hodges\ndoes not argue that one of the exceptions applies; instead, he argues that he did not fail\nto develop the factual basis of his claim and is therefore entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n       We need not decide whether Hodges developed the factual basis of his claim in\nstate court because the Supreme Court’s decision in Cullen v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213842\"><a href=\"/opinion/213842/cullen-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court held that\n“review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.” Id. at 1398. It reasoned that the language of the\nstatute is “backward-looking” and “requires an examination of the state-court decision\nat the time it was made. It follows that the record under review is limited to the record\nin existence at that same time i.e., the record before the state court.” Id. The Court also\nnoted that its holding did not “render[] § 2254(e)(2) superfluous” because it “continues\nto have force where § 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief.” Id. at 1400–01.\n\n       Hodges’s ineffective assistance claim was brought under § 2254(d)(1), and it was\nadjudicated on the merits by the state courts. Pinholster therefore applies. It was a\nreasonable exercise of the district court’s discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing on\nthe claim, because any evidence introduced would be “irrelevant” and “have no bearing\non § 2254(d)(1) review” in any event. See id. at 1400.\n\n       B.      Ineffective Assistance\n\n       To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, Hodges\nmust show both that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense.

However, “Strickland does not require counsel to investigate every\nconceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to\nassist the defendant at sentencing.” Id. at 533. The court must consider not only the\nevidence known to counsel, but also whether that evidence “would lead a reasonable\nattorney to investigate further.” Id. at 527. “[I]f a habeas claim does not involve a\nfailure to investigate but, rather, petitioner’s dissatisfaction with the degree of his\nattorney’s investigation, the presumption of reasonableness imposed by Strickland will\nbe hard to overcome.” Campbell v.

The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel\nsatisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Id.\n\n       The state court record supports the conclusion that Hodges’s trial counsel\nreasonably investigated Hodges’s background and presented mitigating evidence. The\nTennessee Supreme Court summarized the mitigation evidence presented at sentencing\nas follows:\n\n       In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of\n       his mother, his brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist.\n       This proof showed that the defendant was the next to youngest of his\n       mother’s five sons. His mother and father were not married. His father\n       was actually married to another woman, but engaged in what one of the\n       witnesses described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother\n       for eighteen years. The defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother\n\fNo. 09-5021      Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 33\n\n\n      and was strict with the defendant’s brothers, three of whom were the\n      children of another man. The defendant, however, was his father’s\n      favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties forced the family to move\n      about frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family only\n      sporadically.\n      The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until\n      he was twelve years old. At that time, he began to associate with older\n      boys, sniff glue and gasoline, be truant from school, and run away from\n      home. He also engaged in sexual activities with his younger brother and\n      attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He became involved\n      with the juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in\n      Chattanooga.\n      Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that\n      a catalyst and major contributing cause of his delinquent and later\n      criminal behavior was his rape and sexual abuse by a stranger when he\n      was twelve years old. According to the defendant, he accepted a\n      stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from\n      his home on Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges\n      home, the stranger drove Hodges to his home and raped him. Fearing\n      rejection by his homophobic father and driven by guilt, the defendant\n      told no one of this incident until he was arrested in 1990.\n      Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an\n      antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and substance\n      (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated by a subconscious desire for\n      revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was twelve,\n      coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was\n      engaged in homosexual prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic]\n      sister-in-law shortly before the killing that he was a homosexual\n      prostitute. The defense also introduced testimony that Brown dominated\n      and manipulated the defendant.\n      In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and\n      Dr. Leonard Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the\n      defendant and concluded that he suffered from an antisocial personality\n      disorder. They described persons with this disorder as having “no\n      conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest and\n      untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and\n      . . . willing to use any means to get what they want, no matter who it\n      hurts.” While acknowledging the complicated factors involved in\n      antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts discounted the\n      singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in\n      causing the defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                              Page 34\n\n\n       defendant “was in complete control of his behavior” and not suffering\n       from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\n\nHodges, 944 S.W.2d at 350–51. Because Hodges alleges that his trial counsel’s\nmitigation case overlooked significant aspects of his background, the mitigation\ntestimony merits more detailed attention.\n\n       Dr. Nurcombe, head of child psychiatry at Vanderbilt Medical School, testified\nthat he specialized in juvenile delinquency and the effects of sexual abuse, and that he\nhad examined at least 500 children. To assess Hodges, Dr. Nurcombe reviewed his\nschool records, legal records, mental health records, and the results of an investigation\nby a private investigation group concerning his family background. He also interviewed\nHodges for a total of nine hours on three occasions, and had a one-hour phone interview\nwith him.     The mental health records available to Dr. Nurcombe included five\npsychological tests from the age of twelve to late adolescence. He found no evidence\nthat Hodges was insane, but he did say that Hodges was not mentally healthy. He also\nsaid that Hodges suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and\nsubstance abuse.\n\n       In addition to Dr. Nurcombe, Hodges’s counsel presented six other witnesses at\nsentencing: Hodges’s mother, three of his brothers, a neighbor, and Hodges himself. The\ntestimony generally showed that Hodges had a difficult childhood in a low-income,\ndysfunctional family and that his behavior significantly worsened at the age of twelve,\naround the time he claims to have been raped. However, Hodges himself admitted that\nhis parents treated him well, and that his mother took him for mental health treatment\nmany times.\n\n       At the state post-conviction proceeding, Hodges presented additional testimony.\nHe presented the testimony of his trial counsel, each of whom explained that they did not\nsufficiently prepare for the sentencing phase of trial. He also presented the evidence of\nDr. Ann Charvet, a clinical sociologist, who explained that she did not think the\nmitigation information she had compiled was used properly by the defense team, but was\nunable to suggest any specific information that Dr. Nurcombe or other witnesses failed\n\fNo. 09-5021           Hodges v. Colson                                            Page 35\n\n\nto present to the jury. He presented the testimony of David Keefe, chief counsel of the\nTennessee District Public Defender’s Conference, who had reviewed Hodges’s counsel’s\nrepresentation and concluded that it was deficient. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10.\nAnd he presented the evidence of mitigation specialist Julie Hackenmiller, who holds\na masters degree in forensic psychology. She discussed mitigation themes that were not\ndeveloped at trial.\n\n       Although the evidence presented at the post-conviction proceeding shows that\ntrial counsel’s performance was not perfect, in light of the substantial and competent\nevidence produced at the penalty phase of Hodges’s trial, Hodges has not shown that the\nTennessee state court’s decision that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient was\nunreasonable. The burden of proof is on Hodges, Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398, and\nunder the “doubly deferential” standards imposed by § 2254(d) and Strickland, id. at\n1403, Hodges has not carried that burden. Here, Hodges’s counsel retained a mitigation\nspecialist and several experts. Defense counsel obtained most of Hodges’s available\nschool, medical, and juvenile records. Dr. Nurcombe used those records and his\ninterviews with Hodges to diagnose him, testify at length about his background, and link\nhis homosexual rape at age twelve and his exposure as a homosexual prostitute to his\ncrime. The testimony of Hodges’s family members was consistent with Dr. Nurcombe’s\ntestimony and conclusions. And in post-conviction proceedings, Hodges identified little\ninformation not considered by Dr. Nurcombe.\n\n       The circumstances of this case are similar to those considered by the Supreme\nCourt in Bobby v. Van Hook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There, the petitioner claimed that his\ncounsel were ineffective because their mitigation investigation was insufficient. Id. at\n18. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that although the petitioner was tried less\nthan three months after his indictment, trial counsel spoke with his parents, an aunt, and\na family friend; consulted with two expert witnesses; contacted the Veterans\nAdministration and sought medical records; and enlisted a mitigation specialist. Id.\nTrial counsel also presented evidence that the petitioner began drinking and using drugs\nas a child, witnessed his father abuse his mother, had violent fantasies, attempted suicide\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v.

The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner’s argument that his counsel could\nhave found more mitigating evidence by interviewing other members of his extended\nfamily and a psychiatrist who once treated his mother:\n\n        [T]here comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can\n        reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and search for it\n        distractive from more important duties. . . . [I]t was not unreasonable for\n        [the petitioner’s] counsel not to identify and interview every other living\n        family member or every therapist who once treated his parents.\n\nId. at 19.\n\n        Here, given the mitigation evidence Hodges’s counsel gathered from his family\nand Dr. Nurcombe’s review of his background, it was reasonable for counsel not to\nidentify and interview more distant family members or review their mental health. And\nto the extent that Hodges argues that counsel were ineffective for relying on Dr.\nNurcombe, see Pet.’s Br. at 15 (describing Nurcombe as “a Court TV pundant [sic]”),\n112 (Nurcombe “fail[ed] to conduct the sort of thorough personal history that is\nnecessary to come to an accurate diagnosis”), his argument fails because Hodges has not\nshown that trial counsel had good reason to believe Dr. Nurcombe was incompetent, or,\nfor that matter, that he was incompetent.6 See Fautenberry v.

The Guidelines state that “[i]t is suggested that [pleading a client guilty and\nthen putting on a contested penalty hearing] is an effective strategy only when the\nattorney knows without any doubt that no death sentence will result.

Donald Dawson, one of Hodges’s trial attorneys, testified in the post-\nconviction proceeding in state trial court that the decision to have Hodges plead guilty\nwas made during the weekend prior to trial when the attorneys “sat down and pretty\nmuch saw the guilt-innocence phase as hopeless.” J.A. at 1745. The attorneys were\n“trying to figure out what was the way to limit the jurors[’] bad feelings about us [a]nd\n[we] thought that by pleading guilty, we could give the defense some credibility.” Id.\nat 1746; see also id. (“[W]e [thought we] could get the jury to sort of be thankful to us\nthat we didn’t make them sit through a guilt-innocence phase and we wouldn’t lose our\nown credibility by arguing the guilt or innocence and we would have a better chance to\nget a life verdict.”).\n\n        On its face, this appears to be the sort of strategic trial decision owed deference\nunder Strickland. However, Dawson also testified that the defense team did “[n]ot\nadequately” think through the decision to plead guilty: “we never sat down and did an\nanalysis of what are the benefits of going to trial, what are the deficits and where did that\nlead us.” Id. Dawson testified that at the time of trial, the defense team had not read\navailable literature setting out standards for adequate representation in capital cases. Id.\nat 1747. In particular, the attorneys were unfamiliar with “the advantages of putting [on]\na defense [in the guilt phase] consistent with your mitigation theory.” Id. They also\nfailed to appreciate the advantages of “hav[ing] the jury . . . have a chance to look at\nyour client longer and find him guilty[,] [a]nd then decide [‘]now that we find him\nguilty, let’s see . . . [w]hat is the proper sentencing[’].” This would allow the jury to not\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v.

Id. at 1748; see also id. at 1841–43 (post-conviction hearing testimony of\nMichael Terry). The attorneys conducted no legal research into proper considerations\nin deciding whether to plead guilty, and did not weigh the possible benefits of putting\non a case at the guilt phase of trial. Id. at 1748–1751; see also id. at 1839 (testimony of\nMichael Terry).\n\n       Dawson also testified that nearly all of the evidence that he and the other\nattorneys hoped to keep out by pleading guilty came in anyway at the sentencing phase,\nas should have been clear from an analysis of Tennessee law. Id. at 1752–53. Finally,\nDawson stated that when he advised Hodges to plead guilty, the attorneys had “totally\nforgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated robbery, a conviction of\nwhich constituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase. Id. at\n1756–57. In fact, Dawson did not “recall having talked to Mr. Hodges at all about\npleading to the robbery.” Id. at 1757. Both Dawson and co-trial-counsel Michael Terry\nstated that pleading guilty was a mistake. Id. at 1755, 1762–63, 1842. Terry stated that\nhe “would not plead a capital defendant guilty again in any case.” Id. at 1842.\n\n       Additionally, in the post-conviction hearing, the court heard testimony from\nDavid Keefe, chief counsel for the capital division of the Tennessee District Public\nDefender’s Conference, who examined the conduct of Hodges’s trial counsel at the\nrequest of Hodges’s post-conviction attorneys.

Thus, although the decision to plead guilty was indeed a\n“strategic” decision designed to curry favor with the jury and limit the prosecution’s\npresentation of evidence, it was not intelligently made based on a weighing of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of going to trial in the guilt phase, and was made without\nreference to secondary authorities providing standards for representation in death penalty\ncases. Further, the strategy was ill-designed to achieve one of its primary aims: limiting\npresentation of damaging evidence about the crime. Therefore, advising Hodges to\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 41\n\n\nplead guilty was inconsistent with the prevailing standard of competent representation\nin death penalty cases.\n\n        Post v. Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"175168\"><a href=\"/opinion/175168/post-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2010), discussed by the majority, is\ndistinguishable. In Post, the defendant “refused to plead guilty, despite the State’s offer\nof a life sentence in return for a guilty plea.” Id. at 417. The case addressed the question\nwhether the decision to enter a no-contest plea and to submit the penalty phase to a\nthree-judge panel rather than a jury was objectively reasonable. The court concluded\nthat the defendant’s weak mitigation evidence made the attorneys’ decision to forgo the\nright to a penalty-phase jury reasonable. Id. The Post court thus stated that “Post’s\ncounsel were between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way to spare him\na death sentence, given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, his numerous\nconfessions, and his refusal to plead guilty.” Id. at 418. Although these considerations\nare similar to those facing Hodges’s attorneys, the Post decision does not suggest that\ndefense counsel failed to appreciate the import of their decision. Indeed, the opinion\nindicates that counsel weighed the pros and cons of pleading no contest and putting the\ncase before a three-judge panel instead of a jury. Id. Further, part of the rationale\nadvanced by the Post court in justifying counsel’s decision was that “[b]y pleading no\ncontest, [Post] would ‘avoid[ ] the ordeal’ of a guilt phase and have his sentence\n‘determined without the sentencing court hearing all of the adverse testimony that would\nbe produced at trial.’” Id. at 417 (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4–6.1\ncmt. (2d ed. 1980) (“The Defense Function”) (emphasis and third bracket added by\nPost)). Although Hodges’s defense team intended their decision to plead guilty to have\nthe same effect, in reality nearly all of the testimony that would have been introduced\nat trial was introduced during the penalty phase. The miscalculation was not a matter\nof a sound decision turning out to be a mistake in hindsight. Rather, the decision had no\nlegal support and was clearly a mistake in the first place. Hodges’s attorneys hoped that\npleading guilty would be a beneficial strategy, but had little sound reasoning behind this\nbelief. See Post, 621 F.3d at 428 (Cole, J., dissenting) (“I believe that the Constitution\nrequires attorneys to make strategic judgments based on something more concrete than\nunsubstantiated hope, especially when their client’s life hangs in the balance.”).\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                                  Page 42\n\n\n        Nixon is also distinguishable. In Nixon, defense counsel was faced with\noverwhelming evidence of Nixon’s guilt. After a failed attempt to negotiate a guilty plea\nin exchange for the prosecutor dropping the death penalty, defense counsel “concluded\nthat the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in\nurging leniency during the penalty phase.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 181. Instead of advising\nhis client to enter a guilty plea, however, defense counsel decided to proceed to the guilt\nphase of trial, but to concede Nixon’s guilt to the jury. In opening statement, defense\ncounsel “acknowledged Nixon’s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.”\nId. at 182. The prosecution introduced extensive evidence of Nixon’s guilt during the\nguilt phase. Defense counsel “cross-examined [the prosecution’s] witnesses only when\nhe felt their statements needed clarification, . . . and he did not present a defense case.”\nId. at 183. He also objected to some evidence as unduly prejudicial. “In his closing\nargument, [defense counsel] again conceded Nixon’s guilt, and reminded the jury of the\nimportance of the penalty phase.” Id. (internal citation omitted). The jury found Nixon\nguilty, and the case proceeded to the penalty phase, at which defense counsel presented\ntestimony of a number of witnesses. Id. at 183–84. Importantly, “[t]he State presented\nlittle evidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence\nby reference.” Id. at 184.\n\n        The Nixon Court did not address the issue presented here. In fact, counsel in\nNixon did exactly what Hodges’s counsel now concede they should have done. In\napproving of Nixon’s attorney’s strategic decision, the Court discussed the downside to\npleading guilty in lieu of going to trial at the guilt phase:\n\n        As [defense counsel] determined here, pleading guilty without a\n        guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little\n        if any benefit for the defendant. See ABA Guidelines for the\n        Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty\n        Cases § 10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L.\n        Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (“If no written guarantee can be obtained that\n        death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be\n        extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.”).\n        Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the\n        likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt\n        during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are\n\fNo. 09-5021        Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 43\n\n\n       fresh in the jurors’ minds as they deliberate on the sentence. See [Gary]\n       Goodpaster, [The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death\n       Penalty Cases], 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 299, 331[,] 558–59, 560–61 [(1983)].\n\n543 U.S. at 191 n.6 (citation altered). Had Hodges’s counsel acted as Nixon’s did by\nproceeding to trial and acknowledging guilt rather than pleading guilty, there would have\nbeen no constitutionally deficient performance.\n\n       Addressing Hodges’s Strickland claim, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\nreasoned:\n\n       Although it is true that the appellant ultimately gained nothing by\n       pleading guilty, the record persuasively demonstrates that the appellant\n       had little to gain by insisting upon a trial. It is undisputed that the\n       evidence against the appellant was overwhelming and that his chances of\n       acquittal were virtually non-existent. Indeed, in advising the appellant,\n       defense counsel was faced with two options: plead not guilty to the\n       indictment and face a full trial; or plead guilty to the indictment and face\n       limited evidence in a sentencing hearing with an opportunity to trade on\n       his acceptance of his guilt and remorse. Confronted with the\n       overwhelming evidence of the appellant’s guilt, defense counsel advised\n       the appellant to plead guilty in the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency\n       during the sentencing phase. Defense counsel reasonably believed that\n       the jury would view the appellant’s guilty plea as an expression of\n       remorse warranting a less severe sentence than that imposed upon a\n       defendant who protests his innocence in the face of overwhelming\n       evidence of guilt. Moreover, by pleading guilty, the appellant eliminated\n       the presentation to the jury of all of the evidence available to establish\n       the appellant’s guilt of the murder. The hard callous facts behind the\n       offenses, in essence, were desensitized by avoiding the guilt phase. The\n       absence of an in-depth recitation of facts enabled the appellant to seek\n       some sympathy from the jury in the face of mitigating evidence.\n\nHodges v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000). The court\nreasonably pointed to Hodges’s counsel’s “hope of obtaining leniency during the\nsentencing phase” as a legitimate justification for pleading guilty. Id. However, the\nother reasons advanced in support of counsel’s decision lack support in the record. Most\nof the evidence of the circumstances of the murder was allowed in the penalty phase, and\nthe “hard callous facts behind the offense” were not “desensitized by avoiding the guilt\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                             Page 44\n\n\nphase.” Rather, those newly-presented facts were fresh in jurors’ minds when they\ndeliberated over imposition of the death penalty. As Gary Goodpaster observed:\n\n        [G]oing through a guilt phase trial helps to segregate and distance from\n        the sentencer the prosecution's strongest case against the defendant.\n        Were defendant simply to admit guilt and go straight to the penalty phase\n        trial, the prosecution at that time would undoubtedly present much of\n        what it otherwise would have presented during the guilt phase.\n\nGoodpaster, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 331. Hodges’s counsel did not consider the\nramifications of pleading guilty rather than proceeding to the guilt phase of the trial.\nMuch of the evidence they hoped to exclude was admissible under Tennessee law.\nCounsel admitted forgetting about the aggravated robbery charge, itself an aggravating\nfactor once Hodges pleaded guilty. Although I am mindful of the deference due to the\nstate court under AEDPA, I must conclude that the decision that counsel met minimum\nconstitutional standards involved an unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law.\n\n        B. Prejudice\n\n        In order to demonstrate prejudice, “the defendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty\nand would have insisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (1985).\n\n        The majority is correct that Hodges himself has never stated that, but for his\ncounsel’s deficient advice, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on\ngoing to trial. Additionally, Hodges’s habeas petition alleged that counsel’s advice to\nplead guilty constituted ineffective assistance, but did not specifically state that, had\ncounsel advised him otherwise, he would not have pleaded guilty. Hodges’s brief on\nappeal states simply that “where Mr. Hodges had nothing to gain by pleading guilty, he\ncertainly would not have entered a guilty plea if his lawyers had given him accurate\ninformation – in fact, had Mr. Hodges’s lawyers done their research, they wouldn’t have\nadvised Mr. Hodges to plead guilty at all.” (Opening Br. of Appellant 83.) However,\nthis is not the typical guilty plea case.\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 45\n\n\n        As the majority correctly notes, Hodges was not protesting his innocence leading\nup to trial. Rather, he had admitted his guilt in one or more television interviews and in\nletters to the prosecution and the trial court (against the advice of counsel). See J.A. at\n1704, 1786 (testimony of Donald Dawson). This certainly suggests that Hodges was\nready to plead guilty, and that he would have been convicted had he pleaded not guilty.\nThat, however, does not settle the issue. The issue here is not whether counsel were\ncompetent in their assessment and advice regarding the likelihood of conviction at trial,\nbut rather in advising that there were significant benefits to forgoing trial. See Griffin\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782125\"><a href=\"/opinion/782125/phillip-griffin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that it is “easier to show\nprejudice in the guilty plea context” than in other contexts “because the claimant need\nonly show a reasonable probability that he would have pleaded differently”).\n\n        In Hill, the Court stated that “where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to\ninvestigate or discover potentially exculpatory evidence, the determination whether the\nerror ‘prejudiced’ the defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will\ndepend on the likelihood that discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to\nchange his recommendation as to the plea.” 474 U.S. at 59. Hodges’s claim here is not\nthat counsel failed to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory evidence that would\nhave led him to change his plea, so this language from Hill is not squarely on point.\nHodges’s claim is, however, that counsel failed to adequately consider the benefits of\ngoing to trial, and based their decision to advise him to plead guilty on an erroneous\nunderstanding of the consequences of a guilty plea at sentencing and insufficient legal\nresearch and investigation into the proper conduct of a capital case. This parallels the\nreasoning of Hill. Hodges’s two primary trial attorneys both testified that had they been\naware of the proper standards for death penalty representation and had they accurately\nconsidered the drawbacks to pleading guilty, they would have advised Hodges to go to\ntrial. J.A. at 1755, 1842. Thus, there is compelling evidence that counsel would have\n“changed [their] recommendation as to the plea.” Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\n\n        The ultimate question under Strickland and Hill is whether the defendant has\n“established the reasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for\n\fNo. 09-5021         Hodges v. Colson                                               Page 46\n\n\nhis counsel’s deficiency.” Premo v. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182991\"><a href=\"/opinion/182991/premo-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (2011) (emphasis\nadded). Although Hodges has not stated under oath that he would not have pleaded\nguilty if his counsel had advised against it, counsel’s testimony that they would have\nadvised him against pleading guilty establishes the requisite “reasonable probability” of\na different outcome. This is not a case where the decision to plead guilty or not guilty\nwas based on the likelihood of conviction versus acquittal. Rather, the choice was made\non the likely effect of the choice on the outcome of the penalty phase, and it is clear that\ncounsel’s advice in this regard was constitutionally ineffective. Had Hodges’s counsel\nadvised him to plead not guilty, there is no reason to think he would not have heeded\ntheir advice. His conduct during the penalty phase, including taking the stand to provide\ntestimony about his background in order to establish mitigating factors, demonstrates\nthat he preferred a sentence of life imprisonment over death. Had his counsel informed\nhim that the better strategy for achieving this outcome was to plead not guilty and go to\ntrial in the guilt phase, there is more than a reasonable probability that Hodges would\nhave taken their advice.\n\n        In sum, although the Supreme Court recently cautioned that “hindsight cannot\nsuffice for relief when counsel’s choices [to advise the defendant to plead guilty] were\nreasonable and legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would proceed,” and that\n“[t]here is a most substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffective assistance” in\nthat situation, Premo, 131 S. Ct. at 745, counsel’s choices here were based on\nunreasonable predictions about how the penalty phase would proceed, particularly about\nhow pleading guilty would affect the prosecution’s ability to present damaging evidence\nabout the details of the crime, and a complete failure to consider the benefits of going\nthrough the guilt phase. Further, Hodges has made an adequate showing of prejudice.\n\n        Because I conclude that the state court unreasonably applied Strickland, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III of the majority’s opinion and would grant Hodges’s\npetition for habeas corpus on this issue.\n\f</pre>",
