Because the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of conclusively\n        establishing each element of their causes of action, the trial court\n        should not have rendered a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs............... xiii\n\n2.      Because there is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds\n        that are necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary\n        judgment, the trial court should not have rendered a summary\n        judgment for the Plaintiffs. .......................................................................... xiii\n\n3.      The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary\n        judgment for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Deed Without Warranty\n        did not convey ownership or that the Franks had no ownership interest\n        to convey to the Lances or that the Lances do not own the disputed\n        area or that the Deed Without Warranty is an invalid cloud and burden\n        on an easement. ............................................................................................ xiii\n\n4.      The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary\n        judgment for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Plaintiffs had an express\n        easement in the disputed area. ..................................................................... xiii\n\n5.      The trial court had no legal or factual basis to find that any element of\n        a Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Chapter 12 claim was conclusively\n        established.................................................................................................... xiii\n\n6.      The evidence does not support the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n        fees to either or both the Plaintiffs and BMA.............................................. xiii\n\n                                                          -iv-\n\f7.       The trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Plaintiffs and BMA is\n         neither equitable nor just. ............................................................................ xiii\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS ........................................................................................1\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ......................................................................11\n\nARGUMENT ...........................................................................................................12\nI.       The Plaintiffs had the burden to conclusively establish each element\n         of their causes of action. ............................................................................... 12\n\nII.      There is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds that are\n         necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary judgment. ........... 14\n\nIII.     Trespass to Try Title is the only procedural vehicle available for\n         determining title; the Declaratory Judgment Act will not support this\n         summary judgment order. ............................................................................. 16\n\nIV.      Only the grantor may seek to have a deed set aside. .................................... 18\nV.       The ownership of the disputed area remains disputed and as long as\n         that dispute remains, there can be no determination of title......................... 19\n\nVI.      The Spettle Deed is void because it does not contain the nucleus of a\n         valid description............................................................................................ 22\n\nVII. There can be no express easement based on language in a conveyance\n     that is not in the Plaintiffs’ chain of title. ..................................................... 23\n\nVIII. For a host of reasons, the Spettle Deed does not establish an express\n      easement in the lands conveyed to MVIC. ................................................... 25\n\n         i.       The language does not comply with the Statute of Frauds. ................26\n\n         ii.      There is no language creating a dominant and servient estate. ...........27\n\n         iii.     At best, the language creates a nontransferable license or\n                  easement in gross.................................................................................27\n\n         iv.      The language does not contain explicit terms of the easement. ..........28\n         v.       Rights under an express easement are not implied. ............................28\n\n\n\n                                                          -v-\n\f         vi.      None of Plaintiffs’ deeds contain any easement language..................29\n\nIX.      A deed cannot be a cloud on an easement. ................................................... 29\n\nX.       The Plaintiffs did not obtain a summary judgment on their CPRC\n         Chapter 12 claim, but there is no support for the favorable findings the\n         Plaintiffs received in the trial court’s summary judgment order. ................. 30\n\nXI.      There is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the fees\n         awarded to the Plaintiffs and BMA; nor is it equitable and just to\n         award them.................................................................................................... 31\n\nCONCLUSION ........................................................................................................37\nPRAYER ..................................................................................................................38\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE ................................................................................39\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE .......................................................................40\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nTab A             Amended Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nTab B             Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nTab C             Supplement to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nTab D             Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Severance, Attorney’s Fees, and Final\n                  Judgment\nTab E             Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees and Final Judgment\n\nTab F             Motion for New Trial of John A.

Plaintiffs sued Defendants under the Declaratory\n                            Judgments Act and Chapter 12 of the Civil Practice &\n                            Remedies Code to determine title, set aside a deed and\n                            establish an easement.

After judgment was entered, the\n                            Defendants filed a motion for new trial on the\n                            attorney’s fee award. CR 490-92. Tab F. The trial\n                            court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. CR\n                            514-16. Tab G.\n\nTrial court disposition.    The Honorable Keith Williams granted the motion for\n                            summary judgment (by an amended order) on June 11,\n                            2014. CR 412-14. Tab A. The Honorable M. Rex\n                            Emerson signed an order of severance on June 12,\n                            2014. CR 251-52. Tab D. The Amended Award of\n                            Attorney’s Fees and Final Judgment was signed by\n                            Judge Emerson on October 30, 2014. CR 505-06.

The Court should grant oral argument because\n\noral argument would significantly aid the Court in deciding this case. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 38.1(e), 39.1(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -xii-\n\f                            ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Because the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of conclusively establishing\n     each element of their causes of action, the trial court should not have\n     rendered a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs.\n\n2.   Because there is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds that are\n     necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary judgment, the trial\n     court should not have rendered a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs.\n\n3.   The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary judgment\n     for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Deed Without Warranty did not convey\n     ownership or that the Franks had no ownership interest to convey to the\n     Lances or that the Lances do not own the disputed area or that the Deed\n     Without Warranty is an invalid cloud and burden on an easement.\n\n4.   The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary judgment\n     for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Plaintiffs had an express easement in the\n     disputed area.\n\n5.   The trial court had no legal or factual basis to find that any element of a\n     Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Chapter 12 claim was conclusively\n     established.\n\n6.   The evidence does not support the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to\n     either or both the Plaintiffs and BMA.\n\n7.   The trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Plaintiffs and BMA is\n     neither equitable nor just.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -xiii-\n\fTO THE HONORABLE FOURTH COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Appellants, John A. Lance, Debra L. Lance, F.D. Franks and Helen Franks\n\n(referred to herein as “Defendants” or as “Lances” or as “Franks”), file this their\n\nBrief of Appellants, and respectfully show the Court as follows:\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      The Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment based on the Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act and Chapter 12 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\nThe Plaintiffs asserted that “[t]he testimony and documentary evidence presented\n\nto the Court at the temporary injunction held on July 16, 2012 establish the\n\nforegoing as a matter of law.” Tab B.\n\n      The Summary Judgment evidence before the trial court was expressed in the\n\nfollowing manner by the Plaintiffs: “The transcript of the hearing and the exhibits\n\nadmitted at the hearing are referenced and specified as evidence in support of this\n\nmotion.” Tab B.\n\n      In its supplement to their motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs\n\nattached the “sworn testimony given at the temporary injunction hearing held on\n\nJuly 16, 2012.” Tab C. The Plaintiffs stated that they were offering “this record\n\nin support of their motion for partial summary judgment.” Tab C. For some\n\nreason, the Plaintiffs never attached the exhibits from that hearing. Rather, the\n\nPlaintiffs simply stated that they “also offer the exhibits that were admitted at the\n\fhearing, which are currently in the possession of the court reporter.” Tab C.\n\n(emphasis supplied). The exhibits were never filed and are not contained in the\n\nsummary judgment record.\n\n      Accordingly, the Defendants will describe the facts that were addressed in\n\nthe hearing on the temporary injunction.\n\n      At the hearing, counsel for the Plaintiffs described the circumstances that\n\nbrought the parties to the trial court that day. Counsel described a dispute among\n\nthe neighbors in the Redus Point Subdivision on Medina Lake. The Plaintiffs are\n\nthe owners of Lots 1, 2 and 3. The Lances own Lot 8. CR 58.\n\n      The area below and to the side of Lot 8 is “a beachfront area, that’s below\n\nwhat’s called Elevation 1084. 1084 elevation is the approximate location—or\n\nelevation at the top of Medina Dam.” CR 58. Counsel for the Plaintiffs asserted\n\nthat elevation 1084 is the “dividing line between privately-owned property and\n\nproperty that’s owned by the water district, Bexar-Medina-Atascosa County Water\n\nImprovement District No. 1. The water district, BMA, owns everything below\n\nElevation 1084, and the private landowners own everything that’s above Elevation\n\n1084.” CR 58.1\n\n\n1\n      Plaintiffs’ counsel has taken the opposite position in a similar suit. CR 254, 274-\n      89 (“The land between elevations 1072 and 1084 is subject to occasional flooding.\n      Most of this land…is owned and controlled by private landowners, subject to\n      BMA’s right to flood the land in connection with its storage of water for irrigation\n      purposes.” CR 280).\n\n                                           -2-\n\f      Plaintiffs’ counsel further described to the trial court that when the Lances\n\nbought Lot 8 from the Franks, the Lances “also bought another piece of property,\n\n.282 acres below the 1084 line.” CR 60. Counsel’s complaint to the trial court\n\nwas that the Lances were claiming this area below elevation 1084 as their own.\n\nCR 60.\n\n      Counsel for the Defendants explained to the trial court that the Plaintiffs\n\nwant to “cross the street, come around behind my clients’ property, and they’re\n\nasking you for the right to maintain improvements there, put their boats there,\n\nparty, leave beer cans, do whatever it is that they want to on another side of—\n\nentire opposite side of this subdivision and peninsula.” CR 63. On the contrary,\n\nsaid counsel for the Defendants, the “Spettle deed was totally for the purpose for\n\nfolks to preserve those rights with respect to BMA.         That far predates the\n\nconveyance of these individual lots, which have no such reservation of rights.\n\nThere are no reservations of easement or anything of that sort in the lots\n\nconveyed—or in the deeds conveying these lots to the individual lot owners.” CR\n\n63-64.\n\n      Finally, Defendants’ counsel noted that “[w]hen the Lances bought the\n\nproperty from the Franks in 2011, they also obtained the quitclaim deed 2 to this\n\nproperty. The Lances took this dilapidated chain fence that was falling down in\n\n\n2\n      The Deed Without Warranty.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsome places and began erecting a new fence, a new fence that would actually\n\nimprove the value of the property, improve the aesthetic qualities of the\n\nneighborhood, and that’s when all of this became an issue.” CR 64.\n\n      Lemuel Sinclair, a land surveyor, testified at the hearing on behalf of the\n\nPlaintiffs. CR 67-88. Sinclair discussed the Spettle deed, a 1917 deed from\n\nTheresa Spettle to Medina Valley Irrigation Company, (MVIC, BMA’s\n\npredecessor). CR 69-71.\n\n      Sinclair also discussed a different and distinct deed, the Spettle Partition\n\ndeed. The land that this subdivision was built on in 1950 came from the lands\n\npartitioned to Mathilda Spettle Redus in 1917. CR 72-73. Sinclair testified that\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ lots, Lots 1, 2 and 3 in the subdivision, were successors in title to the\n\nlands partitioned to Spettle Redus. CR 73.\n\n      Spettle was asked his opinion as to whether the reservation contained in the\n\nSpettle deed to MVIC passed to subsequent owners such as the Plaintiffs. The trial\n\ncourt sustained the objection to this opinion. CR 74-75. Again, Sinclair was asked\n\nto confirm that “the owners of Lots 1, 2 and 3 have those three rights that were\n\nreserved in the Spettle deed because they are successors in title to the partition\n\nlands…” Again, the objection to that testimony was sustained. CR 76. There was\n\nno testimony presented on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      In discussing the Deed Without Warranty, Sinclair agreed that such a deed\n\nmeans that the grantor makes no promise of title to the grantee.\n\n             Q.    So the grantor, basically, doesn’t guarantee that\n                   they’re giving anything to the grantee, right?\n\n             A.    Right.\n\nCR 81.\n\n      On cross-examination, Sinclair admitted that there are houses on Medina\n\nLake below elevation 1084. CR 82. Sinclair also confirmed that the Plaintiffs\n\nhave lake access from their own property. CR 84-87.\n\n      Several of the Plaintiffs testified.     Gary Fest testified that the Lances’\n\nactivity in denying access to the .282-acre area interfered with the use of the dock.\n\nCR 91. Fest stated that the .282-acre area had been fenced since the 1970s, but that\n\nthis fence had become dilapidated and the neighbors were used to being able to get\n\nthrough the fence easily. The Lances were replacing that fence. CR 96. On cross-\n\nexamination, Fest said that although he was not claiming ownership of the .282-\n\nacre area, he believes he has access to any property below the 1084 line. CR 105,\n\n109-100.\n\n      Defendant, John A. Lance, testified that there had always been a clear fence\n\nand boundary line over the .282-acre area. CR 122-23. Once the Deed Without\n\nWarranty was filed, Lance paid taxes on this tract. CR 124-25. Lance testified\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat BMA did not own the property below elevation 1084, but only that the land\n\nbelow 1084 was subject to flooding. CR 127-130.\n\n      Defendant, F.D. Franks, testified that he and his wife had owned Lot 8 since\n\n1995. CR 133. Franks had been told by his predecessor, Prado, that the .282-acre\n\narea was Franks “to control.” CR 134. Prado gave him the key to the gate. CR\n\n135. On cross-examination, Franks described his reasoning for having the deed\n\nwithout warranty prepared. “A quitclaim deed has been done in several areas of\n\nMedina Lake on adjoining property below the 1084.” CR 138.\n\n            Q.     Mr. Franks, was it simply your intent to convey\n                   whatever rights you did own to the Lances?\n\n            A.     Yes, sir.\n            Q.     And you understand that there may be some\n                   dispute regarding property below the 1084 line?\n\n            A.     Yes, sir.\n            Q.     And that’s why quitclaim deeds were commonly\n                   used with respect to properties that fall below that\n                   line?\n\n            A.     Yes, sir.\n\nCR 139.\n\n      At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court noted that “[o]bviously,\n\nthere is going to need to be some other research, maybe some depositions taken as\n\nto whether or not the 1084 line is treated differently as shoreline property around\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe lake, but this is a hearing for temporary orders, temporary injunction.” CR\n\n140-41.\n\n      The trial judge, based on his prior experience in these Medina Lake disputes,\n\nnoted as well that\n\n             Obviously, there is inconsistency, and I know Mr. Miller\n             knows this because he’s been in court on Medina Lake\n             issues with me before, but there does not appear to be\n             consistency on the enforcement of shoreline rights.\n             There is a lot of metes and bounds disputes and issues,\n             and my guess is we can go around the boundary of\n             Medina Lake and find people who have done just what\n             the Lances have done and people who have done just like\n             the Plaintiffs have done.\n\nCR 142.\n\n      On January 16, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. CR 44-49. The following day, the Plaintiffs filed their supplement to\n\nthat motion attaching the reporter’s record from the hearing on the temporary\n\ninjunction, but not attaching the exhibits from the reporter’s record. CR 50-51.\n\n      On April 5, 2013, the Defendants filed their response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment subject to a previously filed motion to compel and motion to\n\ncontinue the summary judgment hearing. CR 167-181. On October 14, 2013, the\n\nHonorable Keith Williams signed the first order granting the motion for summary\n\njudgment in part. CR 182-84. In the initial order, Judge Williams found that BMA\n\nowned the land below elevation 1084 in fee. CR 182.\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      On November 20, 2013, the Defendants filed a motion for re-hearing of the\n\nsummary judgment motion. CR 185-229. With respect to the motion for re-\n\nhearing, on February 14, 2014, the Defendants filed a notice of intent to use\n\ndiscovery. CR 254-61. This evidence showed that the Plaintiffs had admitted in\n\ndiscovery responses that private property owners and BMA have ownership and/or\n\neasement rights in the area below elevation 1084. CR 256. Plaintiffs answered\n\ninterrogatories that formal legal title to the .282-acre area is “unclear.” CR 260.\n\nAlso on February 14, 2014, the Defendants filed a supplement to their motion for\n\nre-hearing. CR 262-405.\n\n      On April 22, 2014, the Defendants supplemented the motion for re-hearing\n\n(CR 406-411) and attached an affidavit from Mike Grogan, a professional land\n\nsurveyor. Grogan testified that he had reviewed the two Spettle deeds and found\n\nthat the chain of title of Redus Point subdivision goes back to the Spettle Partition\n\ndeed and not to the Spettle deed to Medina Valley Irrigation Company. Grogan\n\nalso found that “the Spettle Deed describes a 1,568.82 acre tract by metes and\n\nbounds, with no reference to the water line, flow-line or Medina Lake boundary\n\nline, and the Spettle Partition Deed does reference the water…” CR 409. Based\n\non the review of these deeds, it is Grogan’s “opinion that the title to land conveyed\n\nby the Spettle Partition Deed, based on the reference to ‘backwater’ or ‘flow-line’\n\nconveys land to the spillway elevation (BMA= 1072’, USGS –1064’) inasmuch\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fand [as] (sic) the Spettle Deed says the land will be used to ‘store water.’ And\n\nwater is stored behind the dam up to the spillway elevation.” CR 410.\n\n      Having considered this additional evidence, on June 14, 2014, the trial court\n\ndeleted its “declaration” 3, deleting the finding that the .282-acre area is owned in\n\nfee by BMA. CR 412-15.\n\n      The motion for entry of final judgment and the hearing on attorney’s fees\n\nwas conducted on September 17, 2014. RR 1. Before the hearing began, counsel\n\nfor Defendants objected to a hearing on BMA’s claim for fees because BMA did\n\nnot file a motion for summary judgment and had not been awarded any relief in the\n\nsummary judgment order. RR 6, 25-27. Defendants objected to the affidavit of\n\ncounsel for the Plaintiffs in that neither the Rogers affidavit or its supplement\n\ncomported with Section 18.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. RR 7-8.\n\nDefendants also objected to the Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with discovery\n\nrequests to produce their attorney contract and fee invoices. The fee invoices were\n\nreceived the day before the hearing rather than 30 days or more before the hearing.\n\nRR 8-11. All objections were overruled. RR 21.\n\n      Stephen Rogers, the attorney for the Plaintiffs, testified that reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees incurred by the Plaintiffs was $171,039.17 (RR 34) and\n\nthat 85% of that sum was attributable to services provided in procuring the\n\nsummary judgment order. RR 35-36. Rogers testified that the work necessary to\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fobtain the summary judgment order included responding to numerous special\n\nexceptions, an appeal on standing and a motion to disqualify counsel. These were\n\ntestified to as examples of the work that was necessary. RR 36-41.\n\n      On cross-examination, Rogers again testified that 85% of the fees were\n\n“attributable to the issues that were decided in the summary judgment and severed\n\ninto this case that we are here today on.” RR 41-44. Rogers admitted that\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims were based on law questions. RR 49-52.\n\n      Ed Hecker testified as the attorney for BMA. RR 64. Hecker redacted work\n\nhe perfomed on the Chapter 12 claims from work performed on the declaratory\n\njudgment action. RR 76-78. On cross-examination, Hecker acknowledged that the\n\nDefendants had not sued BMA (RR 79), and it was BMA that chose to file an\n\nintervention in the case. RR 82. Hecker admitted that the relief granted in the\n\nsummary judgment was based on the Plaintiffs’ motion, not based on any filing by\n\nBMA. RR 83-85. Hecker stated that some of his billing was responding to the\n\nDefendants’ motion for re-hearing of the initial summary judgment ruling. He\n\nconceded that the Defendants were successful on re-hearing.          The trial court\n\nreversed itself on the issue of BMA’s fee interest in the disputed .282-acre area.\n\nRR 86-89.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      This is an odd summary judgment. It is based on a very thin traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The summary judgment evidence consists of an\n\nearly temporary injunction hearing, at the conclusion of which the trial court\n\nremarked on the various fact questions that were presented.          The summary\n\njudgment motion references the deeds and other documents that were admitted at\n\nthe temporary injunction hearing. But those exhibits, including the deeds that form\n\nthe basis of the motion and resulting judgment, were never presented to the trial\n\ncourt as part of the summary judgment evidence. Those exhibits remained in the\n\npossession of the court reporter from the temporary injunction hearing. The deeds\n\nare not part of the summary judgment record.\n\n      The Plaintiffs sought to determine an issue of ownership without filing a\n\ntrespass to try title action. The Plaintiffs sought to set aside the subject “Deed\n\nWithout Warranty,” without filing a suit to set aside the deed. Tab I. But beyond\n\nthese procedural errors, the Plaintiffs failed to prove the issue of ownership as a\n\nmatter of law. The summary judgment evidence (the testimony elicited at the\n\ntemporary injunction hearing) does not establish title to the disputed area. Nor did\n\nthe trial court determine ownership. Indeed, the trial court struck through its\n\nownership finding. Tab A.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f      Nor can the summary judgment be affirmed based on findings of an express\n\neasement. The Deed from Spettle to MVIC (which contains the language relied on\n\nby Plaintiffs) is void for lack of a valid legal description. The Deed from Spettle to\n\nMVIC is not in Plaintiffs’ chain of title; hence as a stranger to that deed, the\n\nPlaintiffs cannot rely on anything contained, referenced, reserved or granted\n\ntherein. Aside from these dispositive principles, the language in the deed does not\n\ncreate an express easement because (1) the language does comply with the statute\n\nof frauds (there is no description of the easement’s location or degree of certainty\n\nsuch that it can be located on the ground); (2) no dominant or servient estate is\n\nidentified in the language; (3) the language is consistent with the creation of a\n\nlicense or an easement in gross; (4) nothing in the Spettle Deed mentions the right\n\nto cross over or linger on and the deed does not give any rights with regard to\n\nanybody else’s property; and, (5) the Plaintiffs’ own deeds are silent as to any\n\neasement rights.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\nI.    The Plaintiffs had the burden to conclusively establish each element of\n      their causes of action.\n\n      Appellate courts review a trial court’s decision to grant no evidence and\n\ntraditional motions for summary judgment de novo. Sudan v. Sudan, 199 S.W.3d\n\n291, 292 (Tex. 2006); Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661\n\n(Tex. 2005). Whether reviewing a traditional or no evidence summary judgment,\n\n                                        -12-\n\fcourts consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and\n\nresolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s favor. See Valence Operating, 164 S.W.3d\n\nat 661; Joe v. Two Thirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 156 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      The movant for summary judgment must show (1) there is no genuine issue\n\nof material fact and (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 166a(c); Amedisys, Inc. v. Kingwood Home Health Care, LLC, 437\n\nS.W.3d 507, 511 (Tex. 2014); Provident Life & Acc. Ins. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211,\n\n215-16 (Tex. 2003); M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d\n\n22, 23 (Tex. 2000). Even if the nonmovant does not file a response and the motion\n\nfor summary judgment is uncontroverted, the movant must still carry the burden of\n\nproof. City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.\n\n1979).\n\n      When, as here, plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their own causes\n\nof action, plaintiffs must prove they are entitled to summary judgment by\n\nestablishing each element of their respective claims as a matter of law. MMP, Ltd.\n\nv. Jones, 710 S.W.2d 59, 60 (Tex. 1986); Fry v. Commission for Lawyer\n\nDiscipline, 979 S.W.2d 331, 334 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, pet.\n\ndenied). If plaintiffs do not conclusively establish all the elements necessary to\n\ntheir causes of action, summary judgment is not proper. See e.g., Wesson v.\n\nJefferson S&L Ass’n, 641 S.W.2d 903, 906 (Tex. 1982) (because plaintiff did not\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fprove it was defendant’s duty to procure insurance, an essential element, summary\n\njudgment was improper).\n\nII.   There is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds that are\n      necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary judgment.\n\n      The Spettle Deed is not attached to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment or to any affidavit attached to Plaintiffs’ Motion. None of the deeds are\n\npart of the summary judgment record.\n\n      The trial court is charged only with the duty of considering the record as it\n\nproperly appears before the court at the time the summary judgment motion is\n\nheard. Trimble v. Gulf Paint & Battery, Inc., 728 S.W.2d 887, 888 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ). In Sorrells v. Giberson, 780 S.W.3d 936 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 1989, writ denied), the promissory note, like the deeds in this case,\n\nwas completely absent from the summary judgment record. The court held that the\n\ncomplete absence of the note from the summary judgment record could not serve\n\nas a basis for summary judgment. Id. at 937-38 (“Neither the trial court nor this\n\nCourt is free to speculate as to its contents”).\n\n      Cases like this one, where there is the complete absence of the summary\n\njudgment evidence, are distinguishable from cases where, for instance, the needed\n\ndocument is referenced in the summary judgment motion and is actually on file,\n\nalbeit attached to a different document. Segal v. Bock, 2011 WL 6306623 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] December 15, 2011, no pet.).\n\n                                          -14-\n\f      The court in Segal v. Bock explained the distinction thusly:\n\n             In Sorrels, the lender of a promissory note moved for\n             summary judgment against the borrower, but did not\n             attach the note to either the summary judgment motion or\n             any other properly filed instrument in the\n             record. [citation omitted]. The court held that, because\n             the note was completely absent from the record, it could\n             not serve as a basis for summary judgment and that the\n             borrower's failure to object was irrelevant to the issue of\n             sufficiency of summary judgment evidence. [citation\n             omitted]. The complete lack of evidence in Sorrels was\n             the substantive defect, however, not the failure to\n             physically attach it to the motion.\n\nId. at *5\n\n      Nor is this a case where a copy of the needed document is attached to an\n\naffidavit and the affiant avers that the copy is a true and correct copy. Zarges v.\n\nBevan, 652 S.W.2d 368, 369 (Tex. 1983). Here vital documents are missing from\n\nthe summary judgment record. The Plaintiffs want to establish rights under a deed,\n\nbut there is no evidence of the deed. The Plaintiffs want to void a quitclaim deed\n\n(the Deed Without Warranty), but there is no evidence of the quitclaim deed.\n\nThere is no evidence of the Spettle deed or the Spettle Partition deed.\n\n      The summary judgment motion is fatally defective because the deeds were\n\nnot attached or otherwise made a part of the summary judgment record. MBank\n\nBrenham, N.A. v. Barrera, 721 S.W.2d 840, 842 (Tex. 1986); See Noland v.\n\nAllstate Insurance Company, 429 S.W. 2d 653, 654 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1968, no writ) (absence from summary judgment record of entire insurance\n\n                                        -15-\n\fpolicy sued on prevented determination of the term “commercial automobile” and\n\nthus required reversal of the summary judgment).\n\nIII.   Trespass to Try Title is the only procedural vehicle available for\n       determining title; the Declaratory Judgment Act will not support this\n       summary judgment order.\n\n       The Plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory judgment on an issue of ownership\n\nthat can only be determined in a trespass to try title cause of action. A trespass to\n\ntry title claim is the method in Texas for adjudicating disputed claims of title to\n\nreal property. Archaelogical Conservancy v. Wilson Land and Cattle Co., 2010\n\nWL 1253576 at *4 (Tex. App.—Austin 2010, no writ) (mem. op.); see also MBM\n\nFin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669 and n. 48 (Tex.\n\n2009) (describing in dicta, property code’s trespass-to-try-title action as the\n\n“exclusive remedy” for adjudicating title disputes). Id.\n\n       “Any suit that involves a dispute over the title to land is, in effect, an action\n\nin trespass to try title, whatever its form and regardless of whether legal or\n\nequitable relief is sought.” Archaelogical Conservancy, 2010 WL 1253576 at *5.\n\nIn pursuit of a declaratory judgment, in Archaelogical Conservancy, the\n\nConservancy sought construction of the terms of a Gift Deed. The Conservancy\n\npresented the issue as whether it had violated the terms of a Gift Deed. If the\n\nConservancy had not violated the terms, then the reverter clause would not be\n\noperative and it would retain title to the disputed land. But the court held that\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fdeciding whether the terms of the Gift Deed had been complied with was not a\n\nseparate stand-alone controversy.        The Conservancy’s request for judicial\n\nconstruction of the Gift Deed’s reverter clause was, in essence, a means to\n\ndetermine title to the disputed property covered by the gift deed. The court held\n\nthat the Conservancy had to pursue its claims in a trespass to try title action.\n\n      Although the existence of another adequate remedy does not necessarily\n\npreclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate, the Act cannot be\n\ninvoked when it would interfere with some other exclusive remedy. MBM Fin.\n\nCorporation v. Woodlands Operating Co., L.P., 292 S.W.3d at 669; see, e.g.,\n\nMartin v. Amerman, 133 S.W.3d 262, 267 (Tex. 2004) (noting that the Property\n\nCode describes trespass-to-try-title actions as the method for determining title to\n\nreal property). The Texas Supreme Court has continually reaffirmed that trespass\n\nto try title is the exclusive method for determining title in Texas.\n\n      “Generally, a trespass to try title claim is the exclusive method in Texas for\n\nadjudicating disputed claims of title to real property. See TEX. PROP. CODE §\n\n22.001(a). “A trespass to try title action is the method of determining title to\n\nlands, tenements, or other real property.” Tex. Parks & Wildlife Dep’t v. Sawyer\n\nTrust, 354 S.W. 3d 384, 389 (Tex. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f      Any suit that involves a dispute over the title to land is, in effect, an action in\n\ntrespass to try title, whatever its form and regardless of whether legal or equitable\n\nrelief is sought. Archaeological Conservancy, 2010 WL 1253576 at *5.\n\nIV.   Only the grantor may seek to have a deed set aside.\n\n      To find title in a party other than the grantee, a court must first set aside the\n\ngrantee’s deed. Plaintiffs did not bring a suit to set aside the Deed Without\n\nWarranty from the Franks to the Lances. Tab I. They have not cleared the way\n\nfor a determination of title in BMA. Nor did the trial court find that BMA has title\n\nto the disputed area. The Deed Without Warranty has not been set aside and\n\nremains a valid deed.\n\n      More importantly, the Texas Supreme Court has made it clear that only the\n\ngrantor in a deed may seek to have it set aside. Plaintiffs cannot avoid this\n\nrequirement by asking the Court for a finding that the Deed Without Warranty\n\nconveyed no ownership interest without first challenging the validity of the Deed\n\nWithout Warranty.\n\n      Until there is a successful suit to set aside a deed, it is valid and represents\n\nprima facie evidence of title. Nobles v. Marcus, 533 S.W.2d 923, 926 (Tex. 1976).\n\nOnly the grantor has a right to seek to have a deed set aside for fraud. Id. at 927;\n\nLopez v. Morales, 2010 WL 3332318 at *3 (Tex. App.—San Antonio).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f      The Texas Supreme Court in Ford v. Exxon Mobil Chem. Co., 235 S.W.3d\n\n615, 618 (Tex. 2007) reaffirmed its holding that deeds are valid until set aside.\n\nThis Court has also addressed who may bring a cause of action for fraud in\n\nconnection with a deed. This Court held that where the complaining party was not\n\nthe grantor, he had no standing to pursue a claim in connection with the\n\ncomplained-of deed. Lopez, 2010 WL 3332318 at *4.\n\n      Under the trial court’s order, Plaintiffs can challenge anyone’s deed. Under\n\nthis order, Plaintiffs do not have to be the grantor in a deed to challenge a deed.\n\nAny person can challenge the deed of another property owner to have themselves\n\ndeclared owner. But Texas law does not allow a non-grantor to bring a cause of\n\naction to have a deed set aside. Plaintiffs are entitled to bring a claim for an\n\nexpress easement to the disputed tract, but they are not entitled to have the deed\n\nfrom the Franks to the Lances set aside. And until such a suit to set aside a deed is\n\nsuccessful, a declaration of title is unavailable.\n\nV.    The ownership of the disputed area remains disputed and as long as\n      that dispute remains, there can be no determination of title.\n\n      What facts were conclusively proved at the hearing on the temporary\n\ninjunction?\n\n      There was testimony that the Plaintiffs have constructed or placed their\n\npersonal property below elevation 1084 in an area of the lake that is partially\n\nenclosed with a fence constructed by the Defendants’ predecessor. There was\n\n                                          -19-\n\ftestimony that the Lances intended to replace the dilapidated fence and that doing\n\nso would effectively keep the Plaintiffs from making use of that area of the lake\n\nbelow elevation 1084.\n\n      There was testimony that the Plaintiffs have lake access from their own lots\n\nbut that access to the lake from their own lots is more difficult than from the\n\nDefendants’ lot. There was testimony that there is no lake to access from any lots\n\nbecause of the drought.\n\n      There was testimony from land surveyor, Lemuel Sinclair, Plaintiffs’ expert,\n\nthat described the parties’ subdivision as having originated from lands in a\n\npartition deed not from lands conveyed in the deed from Spettle to MVIC. Sinclair\n\nwas not permitted to testify as to whether, in his opinion, any reservations passed\n\nto subsequent owners such as the Plaintiffs.\n\n      Although there was a lot of lawyer talk about the Defendants’ inability to\n\nassert exclusive control to the area below elevation 1084, Sinclair testified that\n\nthere are a number of homes that have been built below elevation 1084 along\n\nMedina Lake’s (former) shoreline. The fact that property is being exclusively\n\ncontrolled by private property owners below elevation 1084, rather than by BMA,\n\nconflicts with the Plaintiffs’ testimony that they believe they have access to lake\n\nproperty at any location if the property is below elevation 1084. These facts also\n\ncorroborate Mr. Franks’ testimony that homes have been built below elevation\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f1084. Based on his own experience handling Medina Lake cases, Judge Williams\n\nalso appreciated that this was an ongoing, and not yet resolved, controversy.\n\n      Sinclair testified that the Deed Without Warranty, like a quitclaim deed,\n\nconveys no promise of title. Mr. Franks understood this definition and testified\n\nthat it was his intent to convey whatever rights, if any, he had to that area to the\n\nLances. Mr. Franks understood that that was a common practice at Medina Lake\n\nwith respect to properties that fall below elevation 1084.         Judge Williams\n\nacknowledged as much after the hearing.\n\n      It is obvious that a deed-without-warranty could not be intended to create an\n\nappearance of a conveyance of ownership because the very definition of a deed-\n\nwithout-warranty precludes such intent. And such a deed could not be used or\n\npresented with an intent to injure because, again, a deed-without-warranty is, by\n\ndefinition, not a statement that title is being promised.\n\n      Nothing was conclusively proven at the hearing on the issues of ownership\n\nto the disputed area or the easement rights of the Plaintiffs to the disputed area.\n\nJudge Williams acknowledged as much after the hearing. CR 67-142.\n\n      The hearing established nothing and the deeds are not part of the summary\n\njudgment record. Because the Plaintiffs failed to prove they were entitled to\n\nsummary judgment by establishing each element of their respective claims as a\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fmatter of law, this summary judgment must be reversed. MMP, Ltd. v. Jones, 710\n\nS.W.2d at 60; Wesson v. Jefferson S&L Ass’n, 641 S.W.2d at 906.\n\nVI.   The Spettle Deed is void because it does not contain the nucleus of a\n      valid description.\n\n      The validity of the 1917 deed from the Spettles to BMA, through which\n\nPlaintiffs claim an express easement, is controlled by the finding of this Court\n\nwhich construed another 1917 deed from the Spettles to BMA’s predecessor. The\n\nholding, in that opinion, is that the deed is void because the deed did not contain\n\n“….the nucleus of a valid description.” Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Counties Water\n\nImprovement District No. 1 v. Wallace, 619 S.W.2d 551, 554 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      In Wallace, the Fourth Court explained that:\n\n             [T]he Warranty Deed from Joseph F. Spettle, et al to The\n             Medina Valley Irrigation Company, dated January 18,\n             1917, and of record in Volume G-1, Pages 308-313,\n             Deed Records of Bandera County, Texas, which is an\n             indispensable link in Plaintiff's chain of title, is not\n             sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The beginning\n             point of such tract is described merely as “point ‘2’ ” and\n             there are no means or data contained in the description by\n             which such point may be located on the ground with\n             reasonable certainty. The remaining calls comprising the\n             description is for courses and distances without reference\n             to any objects, monuments or existing writings. None of\n             such calls can be located on the ground without reference\n             to the beginning point. Because of the insufficiency of\n             the field notes, the only descriptive data contained in the\n             Deed are that the tract contains 13.76 acres, more or less,\n             and is off the South side of Survey No. 288, E.\n\n                                        -22-\n\f             Pennington, in Bandera County, Texas. Such description\n             does not furnish within itself, or by reference to some\n             other existing writing, the means or data by which the\n             tract may be identified with reasonable certainty.\n             Because the Deed does not contain the nucleus of a\n             valid description, it is void.\n\nId. at 554 (emphasis supplied).\n\n      The description of land in the subject Spettle Deed to BMA employs an\n\nidentical technique and description as contained in the deed this Court found to be\n\nvoid. The description in the subject Spettle Deed to BMA used, as points of\n\nbeginning, “point 0,” “point 1,” “point 2,” etc. The remaining calls are for course\n\nand distances without references to any object, monuments or existing writings.\n\nAnd, like the previously adjudicated Spettle Deed, no calls for the Spettle Deed to\n\nBMA can be located on the ground without reference to the beginning point.\n\nVoiding this deed precludes the need to consider whether the language in the deed\n\ngives rise to an easement.\n\nVII. There can be no express easement based on language in a conveyance\n     that is not in the Plaintiffs’ chain of title.\n\n      A purchaser is bound by the terms of instruments in his chain of title.\n\nInwood N. Homeowners’ Assoc’n v. Harris, 736 S.W.2d 632, 635 (Tex. 1987)\n\nquoting Cooksey v. Sinder, 682 S.W.2d 252, 253 (Tex. 1984). “A purchaser is\n\nbound by every recital, reference and reservation contained in or fairly disclosed by\n\nany instrument which forms an essential link in the chain of title under which he\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fclaims.” Westland Oil Development Corp. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 637 S.W.2d 903, 908\n\n(Tex. 1982).     See also Williams v. Harris County Houston Ship Channel\n\nNavigation District, 99 S.W.2d 276 (Tex. 1936).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ chain of title goes back to the Spettle Partition deed, not the\n\nSpettle Deed that conveyed land to MVIC, BMA’s predecessor, as Plaintiffs’\n\nexpert testified at the Temporary Injunction hearing (CR 69-73) and as further\n\nexplained in Mike Grogan’s affidavit. (CR 409-10). Said Partition Deed contains\n\nno reference to any type of reservation, grant or license with regard to usage of\n\nwater, access to the Lake or any other such matter. There is nothing to support\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim to an express easement based on a deed which is not in their chain\n\nof title.\n\n       Focusing on the importance of a property owner seeking to claim rights of\n\nan express easement from an earlier document, Greenwood v. Lee, 420 S.W.3d\n\n106, 109 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2012, pet. denied) is instructive. In construing the\n\neasement rights of the current holder, the Amarillo court of appeals looked at a\n\n1964 document creating the express easement, and examined each conveyance in\n\nthe chain of title leading up to the current easement holder’s 2009 deed. Id. at 109-\n\n110.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f       Plaintiffs have identified no law to support their claim to an express\n\neasement based on language in a conveyance that is not in their chain of title. This\n\nis fatal to their claim of an express easement.\n\nVIII. For a host of reasons, the Spettle Deed does not establish an express\n      easement in the lands conveyed to MVIC.\n\n       The basic principles of contract construction and interpretation are applied\n\nwhen considering an express easement’s terms. Ferrara v. Moore, 318 S.W.3d\n\n487, 490 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2010, pet. denied).\n\n       “Where an easement is created by express grant or reservation, the extent of\n\nthe right acquired depends not upon user, as in the case of easements created by\n\nprescription, ... but upon the terms of the grant or reservation properly construed.”\n\nKearney & Son v. Fancher, 401 S.W.2d 897, 905 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth\n\n1966, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n       The language in the Spettle Deed on which Plaintiffs rely for their express\n\neasement is:\n\n               (a)   The right to use the waters in the reservoir for\n                     domestic purposes;\n               (b)   The right to use the waters in the reservoir for\n                     bathing, boating, fishing, and hunting; and,\n\n               (c)   The right to construct upon the edges of the\n                     reservoir at their own peril and expense and\n                     without any liability of the grantors for the\n                     destruction thereof by water or otherwise, such\n                     improvements as may be necessary and incident to\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\f                   the exercise of the privileges above reserved by the\n                   grantors, their heirs and assigns, which privileges\n                   are to be exercised by said parties only to the\n                   extent and in the proportion which the acreage\n                   above described bears to the total acreage under\n                   the flow line of said reservoir.\n\n      i.    The language does not comply with the Statute of Frauds.\n      The first deficiency in the above language creating an express easement is\n\nthat is does not comply with the statute of frauds. Express easements must comply\n\nwith the statute of frauds, which requires a description of the easement’s location.\n\nSeverance v. Patterson, 370 S.W.3d 705, 736 (Tex. 2012).\n\n      The description of an easement requires a sufficient degree of certainty such\n\nthat a surveyor can go upon the land and locate the easement from such\n\ndescription. Vrabel v. Donahoe Creek Watershed Authority, 545 S.W.53, 54 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—Austin 1977, no writ). If the easement does not sufficiently identify a\n\ndescription of its location, then it must fail and will be declared void. Id. The\n\nlanguage relied upon by Plaintiffs is devoid of any description as to where the\n\neasement lies. Worse, there is no description that would enable a surveyor to\n\nlocate the easement.\n\n      For the statute of frauds to be satisfied, the intent of the parties, the essential\n\nterms of the easement, and an adequate description of the easement’s location must\n\nbe apparent from the face of the document, without reference to extrinsic evidence.\n\nIf the court cannot determine these elements with reasonable certainty, then no\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fexpress easement is conveyed. Cummins v. Travis County Water Control and\n\nImprovement District No. 17, 175 S.W.3d 34, 51 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no\n\npet.).\n\n         The language relied upon by Plaintiffs in the Spettle deed is silent as to\n\nwhere the claimed easement is located. The language does not even attempt to\n\nlocate the easement to the degree where a surveyor could go upon the land and\n\nlocate the easement. For these reasons alone, Plaintiffs’ claim for an express\n\neasement fails.\n\n         ii.    There is no language creating a dominant and servient estate.\n         To create an express easement that runs with the land, “there must be a\n\ndominant estate and a servient estate….. This concept is in contrast to an easement\n\nin gross which attaches to an individual and is not dependent upon the existence of\n\na dominant estate in land. Alley v. Carleton, 29 Tex. 74 (1867).” Drye v. Eagle\n\nRock Ranch, Inc., 364 S.W.2d 196, 207 (Tex. 1962). The language relied upon by\n\nPlaintiffs contains no reference to a dominant or servient estate.\n\n         iii.   At best, the language creates a nontransferable license or\n                easement in gross.\n         The right to go upon the land of another for pleasure and recreation, such as\n\nsought in the subject suit, is most typically classified as either (1) a license, as a\n\nlicense to picnic or to hunt, or (2) an easement in gross, which is an interest in\n\nland, usually attached to a person but not attached or appurtenant to the land of the\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fowner of the right. Ordinarily licenses are revocable; and ordinarily, easements in\n\ngross are not transferable or assignable. Drye v. Eagle Rock Ranch, Inc. 364\n\nS.W.2d at 203 (Tex. 1963). The language relied upon by Plaintiffs creates a\n\nlicense or an easement in gross, not an easement appurtenant.\n\n      iv.    The language does not contain explicit terms of the easement.\n      An express easement must be explicit as to the essential terms of the\n\neasement, and an adequate description of the easement's location must be apparent\n\nfrom the face of the document. Cummins v. Travis County Water Control and\n\nImprovement District No. 17, 175 S.W.3d at 51.\n\n      In contrast, the trial court’s ruling simply states: “Plaintiffs own an express\n\neasement in the disputed area.” Perhaps, understandably, no mention is made of\n\nthe terms of the easement or its location since none of such is identified in the\n\npurported easement granting language in the Spettle deed.\n\n      v.     Rights under an express easement are not implied.\n      No rights under an express easement are implied. Coleman v. Forister, 514\n\nS.W.2d 899, 903 (Tex. 1974).        Therefore, since the language relied upon by\n\nPlaintiff is silent as to any rights to use, cross, recreate on or ingress and egress\n\nover any real property, no such rights may be implied. There is no support for the\n\ntrial court’s holding that Plaintiffs have an easement in the disputed area.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f      vi.    None of Plaintiffs’ deeds contain any easement language.\n      Critically, none of Plaintiffs’ deeds contain any easement language which\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court would find relevant. Drye v. Eagle Rock Ranch, Inc.,\n\n364 S.W.2d at 200-01 (“It is significant however, that none of the deeds purported\n\nto grant the purchaser any rights or easement over the ranch or over any property\n\noutside the purchaser’s own lot.”).\n\n      Any one of the above reasons defeats the Plaintiffs’ claim of an express\n\neasement. No construction of the language proferred by the Plaintiffs provides any\n\nassistance to their easement claim. Indeed, every construction fails. The Plaintiffs\n\nhave no claim of an express easement.\n\nIX.   A deed cannot be a cloud on an easement.\n\n      In addition to the errors of fact and law contained in the declarations in the\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment order, the order also contains its share of\n\nabsurdities. For instance, declaration 7 states: “The Deed Without Warranty is an\n\ninvalid cloud and burden on the easement rights of plaintiffs.” CR 413.\n\n      Defendants find no such cause of action in Texas jurisprudence. A cloud on\n\ntitle exists when an outstanding claim or encumbrance is shown, which on its face,\n\nif valid, would affect or impair the title to the owner of the property. Hahn v. Love,\n\n321 S.W.2d 517, 531 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). The\n\nPlaintiffs are not claiming to be the owners of the disputed area. If an easement is\n\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fvalid, it is irrelevant who owns the land. Because it is irrelevant who owns the\n\nland, there is no such thing as a deed causing an invalid cloud on an easement.\n\nX.    The Plaintiffs did not obtain a summary judgment on their CPRC\n      Chapter 12 claim, but there is no support for the favorable findings the\n      Plaintiffs received in the trial court’s summary judgment order.\n\n      “The party asserting a claim under Section 12.002 has the burden to prove\n\nthe requisite elements of the statute.” Aland v. Martin, 271 S.W.3d 424, 430 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2008, no pet.). The summary judgment order does not find for the\n\nPlaintiffs on every element of their Chapter 12 claim. CR 414. The order does not\n\nfind that the Defendants intended the Plaintiffs to suffer financial injury in\n\nviolation of CPRC Section 12.002(a)(3).        But there is also no support for\n\ndeclarations the judgment makes as to other elements of this claim. In the interest\n\nof judicial economy, this Court should make that determination now so that the\n\nDefendants, on remand, will not be met with having to defend a Chapter 12 claim.\n\n      The Plaintiffs do not own an express easement in the disputed area,\n\ntherefore, they do not have standing under CPRC Section 12.003(a)(8). But for the\n\nreasons discussed in Section IX of the Argument, even if the Plaintiffs did have an\n\nexpress easement, they would not have standing under Chapter 12. The Plaintiffs’\n\neasement rights cannot be impaired by any owner or by any deed. Who owns the\n\ndisputed area does not matter.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f      The trial court found that as a matter of law the Defendants intended to\n\ncreate the appearance of an actual conveyance of ownership in the disputed area.\n\nCR 414. But it is undisputed that the Deed Without Warranty, like a quitclaim\n\ndeed, makes no promise of title. That is definitional, not factual. The very nature\n\nof a deed without warranty negates the trial court’s finding. The Plaintiffs’ own\n\nexpert corroborates this understanding.\n\n             Q.       A deed without warranty means that the grantor\n                      makes no promise of title to the grantee, right?\n             A.       That’s right.\n             Q.       So the grantor, basically, doesn’t guarantee that\n                      they’re giving anything to the grantee, right?\n             A.       Right.\n\nCR 81.\n\n      Given that no promise or guarantee of ownership is being made, how can it\n\nbe that the Defendants intended to convey ownership as a matter of law? As noted\n\nby Judge Williams, he assumes many people along the Medina Lake shoreline\n\nhave done the same and there was testimony as well to this effect. CR 138-39,\n\n142. None of the trial court’s findings with regard to Chapter 12 were established\n\nas a matter of law.\n\nXI.   There is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the fees\n      awarded to the Plaintiffs and BMA; nor is it equitable and just to award\n      them.\n\n      On June 12, 2014, the trial court granted the Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nSeverance, Attorney’s Fees, and Final Judgment. Tab D. In that order, the trial\n\n                                          -31-\n\fcourt stated that the matters addressed in the Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion\n\nwere severed. The matters addressed in the summary judgment motion pertain\n\nsolely to the temporary injunction hearing.\n\n      The trial court also ordered that the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees\n\nconnected with the severed matter were to be set for a hearing. Tab D. Thus, the\n\nattorney’s fees that were subject to being awarded would be fees for professional\n\nservices connected with the preparation for and attendance at the temporary\n\ninjunction hearing and the preparation of the motion for summary judgment. All\n\nother issues, and the professional services the parties have required for those other\n\nissues, remain pending in the original cause number or were unnecessary for this\n\nsummary judgment proceeding.\n\n      The Supreme Court has described the proper analysis for awarding fees\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act. The Act entrusts attorney fee awards to the\n\ntrial court's sound discretion, subject to the requirements that any fees awarded be\n\nreasonable and necessary, which are matters of fact, and to the additional\n\nrequirements that fees be equitable and just, which are matters of law. It is an\n\nabuse of discretion for a trial court to rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without\n\nregard to guiding legal principles, e.g., Goode v. Shoukfeh, 943 S.W.2d 441, 446\n\n(Tex. 1997), or to rule without supporting evidence, Beaumont Bank v. Buller, 806\n\nS.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991). Therefore, in reviewing an attorney fee award under\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fthe Act, the court of appeals must determine whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by awarding fees when there was insufficient evidence that the fees were\n\nreasonable and necessary, or when the award was inequitable or unjust.\n\nUnreasonable fees cannot be awarded, even if the court believed them just, but the\n\ncourt may conclude that it is not equitable or just to award even reasonable and\n\nnecessary fees.    This multi-faceted review involving both evidentiary and\n\ndiscretionary matters is required by the language of the Act. Bocquet v. Herring,\n\n972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      Unlike CPRC Chapter 38, a party seeking to recovery attorney’s fees under\n\nChapter 37 enjoys neither a presumption of reasonableness nor the availability of\n\njudicial notice. Gorman v. Gorman, 966 S.W.2d 858, 867 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied). The Plaintiffs were required to prove that their fees\n\nwere reasonable and necessary for the matters for which the Plaintiffs obtained\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n      The test for legal sufficiency is “whether the evidence at trial would enable\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.” City of\n\nKeller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). Although appellate courts\n\nconsider the evidence in a light most favorable to challenged findings of fact,\n\nindulging every reasonable inference that supports them, reviewing courts may not\n\ndisregard evidence that allows only one inference. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d at 822.\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\f      When considering a factual sufficiency challenge, appellate courts consider\n\nand weigh all of the evidence, not just that evidence which supports the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment. Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406–07 (Tex.\n\n1998). The judgment is set aside only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at\n\n407; Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).\n\n      The summary judgment order served as the predicate for the subsequent\n\naward of attorney’s fees. Had there been no summary judgment, it is hard to\n\nimagine the Plaintiffs and BMA moving for their attorney’s fees. But in weighing\n\nall the evidence, this Court must look at the work that would have been necessary\n\nto develop the evidence that was used to support the Plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. The only evidence that was used was the reporter’s record\n\nfrom the hearing on the temporary injunction. The documents that would have\n\nbeen before the trial court on the motion for summary judgment had they been\n\nfiled, were, as Mr. Rogers testified, already in the possession of the Plaintiffs at the\n\ntime they filed suit.\n\n      Both the attorney for the Plaintiffs and the attorney for BMA acknowledged\n\nthe need to segregate their fees and both of them testified that they did so. Rogers\n\ntestified that 85% of his fees were for services related to the summary judgment\n\nissues. Hecker testified that he redacted any work he did related to claims under\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fCPRC Chapter 12. RR 76-78. But how can it be equitable and just for these\n\nparties to recover for the professional services of their attorneys that played no part\n\nin the motion for summary judgment?\n\n         The only services that would be reasonable and necessary would be the\n\nservices provided in developing the evidence and preparing for the temporary\n\ninjunction, the preparation of the motion and supplemental motion for summary\n\njudgment and the temporary injunction and summary judgment hearings\n\nthemselves. The motion for summary judgment is based solely on the temporary\n\ninjunction hearing. The fee statements and attorney testimony upon which the trial\n\ncourt based its award envelop a much larger litigation universe than the work that\n\nwas necessary for the motion for summary judgment.\n\n         In the case of BMA, the equities and justness of the fee award on its behalf\n\nare wholly lacking.      On numerous occasions, trial counsel for the Plaintiffs\n\nobjected to the trial court hearing testimony from counsel for BMA about BMA’s\n\nattorney’s fees. RR 6, 25-27. After all, BMA had chosen to intervene in the\n\nlawsuit. The Defendants had not sued BMA. RR 82. BMA was not yet a party at\n\nthe time of the temporary injunction hearing. BMA did not file the motion for\n\nsummary judgment that led to the summary judgment order and subsequent\n\nhearing on attorney’s fees. BMA, in fact, has yet to obtain any relief from the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\f      Even some of the issues subsumed within the summary judgment order\n\npertain to claims that cannot be brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act. The\n\nclaims to set aside the Deed Without Warranty and claims concerning the\n\nDefendants’ ownership can only be brought as a Trespass to Try Title. Attorney’s\n\nfees are not recoverable for a claim to quiet title. See, e.g., Florey v. Estate of\n\nMcConnell, 212 S.W.3d 439, 448 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied); Sani v.\n\nPowell, 153 S.W.3d 736, 745 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied); Southwest\n\nGuar. Trust Co. v. Hardy Road 13.4 Joint Venture, 981 S.W.2d 951, 957 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied).          A declaratory judgment claim\n\ncannot be used to recover attorney’s fees in a dispute governed by a trespass to try\n\ntitle claim for which attorney’s fees are not recoverable. Coinmatch Corp. v.\n\nAspenwood Apt. Corp., 417 S.W.3d 909, 926 (Tex. 2013); Meekins v. Wisnoski,\n\n404 S.W.3d 690, 701 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.); Basley v.\n\nAdoni Holdings, LLC, 373 S.W.3d 577, 587 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2012, no\n\npet.). As noted in an earlier section of this argument, a trespass to try title claim is\n\n“the method for determining title” to property, and a party may not proceed\n\nalternatively under the Declaratory Judgments Act to recover their attorney’s fees.\n\nCoinmatch Corp., 417 S.W.3d at 926.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      The Plaintiffs believe they have easement rights to the area below elevation\n\n1084 at Lot 8. Disputing the title to that area is unnecessary to the adjudication of\n\nthe asserted easement. Indeed, the Plaintiffs do not have standing to set aside the\n\ndeed between the Franks and the Lances. Issues of ownership are of no legal\n\nconsequence to a holder of easement rights. Unfortunately, the parties have had to\n\nengage in needless litigation because of the Plaintiffs’ insistence on asserting these\n\nirrelevant claims.\n\n      The relevant question is whether the Plaintiffs have easement rights, not who\n\nis the owner of the disputed area. BMA’s presence, therefore, is not needed nor\n\nwas it solicited. Again, it is unfortunate that the Defendants have had to expend\n\ntime and resources engaged in a dispute with BMA.\n\n      But the Defendants have shown that the Plaintiffs do not have easement\n\nrights because the relevant deed is void for lack of a valid legal description,\n\nbecause the relevant conveyance is not in the Plaintiffs’ chain of title and because\n\nthe language does not comply with the statute of frauds, does not create a dominant\n\nand servient estate, does not contain explicit terms of an easement and does not\n\ncontain easement language.\n\n      The attorney’s fees awarded to the Plaintiffs and BMA cannot be justified\n\neither based on a review of all of the evidence or as a matter of equity and justness.\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fThe summary judgment order itself is something less than a model of coherence\n\nwhen due consideration is given to the applicable law and facts. Nothing has been\n\nconclusively proven. The Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof and the\n\nsummary judgment order cannot stand.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      For all of these reasons, the Defendants pray that the summary judgment be\n\nreversed and rendered, or in the alternative, remanded, that the order awarding\n\nattorney’s fees, court costs and interest be reversed and rendered, or in the\n\nalternative, remanded, and that the Defendants have such other and further relief to\n\nwhich they are entitled at law or in equity.\n\n                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 Cynthia Cox Payne\n                                 Texas Bar No. 24001935\n                                 1118 Main Street\n                                 Bandera, Texas 78003\n                                 (830) 796-7030 – Phone\n                                 (830) 796-7945 – Fax\n                                 cpayne@paynelawfirm.net\n                                 /s/Dan Pozza\n                                 Dan Pozza\n                                 State Bar No. 16224800\n                                 239 East Commerce Street\n                                 San Antonio, Texas 78205\n                                 (210) 226-8888 – Phone\n                                 (210) 224-6373 – Fax\n                                 danpozza@yahoo.com\n                                 ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANTS\n                                 JOHN A.

On June 12, 2014, the\n\nHonorable Rex Emerson signed an order severing the matters addressed in the summary\n\njudgment order and the issue of attorney fees into a new cause number. On September 30, 2014,\n\nJudge Emerson signed a final judgment and award of attorney fees in the severed case, No.\n\nCV-12-0100209. The Defendants seek a new trial on the award of attorney fees,\n\n                                                 II.\n\n        The Court should grant a new trial because it erred by making the following rulings:\n\n                The Court erred in awarding $90,000 as attorney fees to the\n                Plaintiffs and against the Dcfondants and in awarding $31,025 as\n                attorney fees to Third Party BMA against the Defendants because\n                there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to support this award.\n                The evidence is insufficient to find that the amounts awarded are\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                                                                      Page 1\n\n\n\n                                                490\n\f                 reasonable or were necessary in the prosecution of this lawsuit.\n                 The conclusory nature of the evidence presented will not support\n                 the attorney fees award.\n\n                Similarly, there is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to suppott\n                the award of appellate attorney fees because the evidence\n                presented was conclusory and the award is speculative. The\n                evidence is insufficient to find that the amount of appellate\n                attorney fees awarded are reasonable or necessary.\n\n                The court erred in admitting, over proper objection, the\n                documentary and other evidence used by the Plaintiffs and BMA to\n                support the award of attorney fees.\n\n         For these reasons, the Defendants ask the Court to grant a new trial.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              Cynthia Cox Payne\n                                              Texas Bar No. 24001935\n                                              P.O.

Because the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of conclusively\n        establishing each element of their causes of action, the trial court\n        should not have rendered a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs............... xiii\n\n2.      Because there is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds\n        that are necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary\n        judgment, the trial court should not have rendered a summary\n        judgment for the Plaintiffs. .......................................................................... xiii\n\n3.      The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary\n        judgment for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Deed Without Warranty\n        did not convey ownership or that the Franks had no ownership interest\n        to convey to the Lances or that the Lances do not own the disputed\n        area or that the Deed Without Warranty is an invalid cloud and burden\n        on an easement. ............................................................................................ xiii\n\n4.      The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary\n        judgment for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Plaintiffs had an express\n        easement in the disputed area. ..................................................................... xiii\n\n5.      The trial court had no legal or factual basis to find that any element of\n        a Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Chapter 12 claim was conclusively\n        established.................................................................................................... xiii\n\n6.      The evidence does not support the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n        fees to either or both the Plaintiffs and BMA.............................................. xiii\n\n                                                          -iv-\n\f7.       The trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Plaintiffs and BMA is\n         neither equitable nor just. ............................................................................ xiii\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS ........................................................................................1\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT ......................................................................11\n\nARGUMENT ...........................................................................................................12\nI.       The Plaintiffs had the burden to conclusively establish each element\n         of their causes of action. ............................................................................... 12\n\nII.      There is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds that are\n         necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary judgment. ........... 14\n\nIII.     Trespass to Try Title is the only procedural vehicle available for\n         determining title; the Declaratory Judgment Act will not support this\n         summary judgment order. ............................................................................. 16\n\nIV.      Only the grantor may seek to have a deed set aside. .................................... 18\nV.       The ownership of the disputed area remains disputed and as long as\n         that dispute remains, there can be no determination of title......................... 19\n\nVI.      The Spettle Deed is void because it does not contain the nucleus of a\n         valid description............................................................................................ 22\n\nVII. There can be no express easement based on language in a conveyance\n     that is not in the Plaintiffs’ chain of title. ..................................................... 23\n\nVIII. For a host of reasons, the Spettle Deed does not establish an express\n      easement in the lands conveyed to MVIC. ................................................... 25\n\n         i.       The language does not comply with the Statute of Frauds. ................26\n\n         ii.      There is no language creating a dominant and servient estate. ...........27\n\n         iii.     At best, the language creates a nontransferable license or\n                  easement in gross.................................................................................27\n\n         iv.      The language does not contain explicit terms of the easement. ..........28\n         v.       Rights under an express easement are not implied. ............................28\n\n\n\n                                                          -v-\n\f         vi.      None of Plaintiffs’ deeds contain any easement language..................29\n\nIX.      A deed cannot be a cloud on an easement. ................................................... 29\n\nX.       The Plaintiffs did not obtain a summary judgment on their CPRC\n         Chapter 12 claim, but there is no support for the favorable findings the\n         Plaintiffs received in the trial court’s summary judgment order. ................. 30\n\nXI.      There is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the fees\n         awarded to the Plaintiffs and BMA; nor is it equitable and just to\n         award them.................................................................................................... 31\n\nCONCLUSION ........................................................................................................37\nPRAYER ..................................................................................................................38\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE ................................................................................39\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE .......................................................................40\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nTab A             Amended Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nTab B             Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nTab C             Supplement to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nTab D             Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Severance, Attorney’s Fees, and Final\n                  Judgment\nTab E             Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees and Final Judgment\n\nTab F             Motion for New Trial of John A.

Plaintiffs sued Defendants under the Declaratory\n                            Judgments Act and Chapter 12 of the Civil Practice &\n                            Remedies Code to determine title, set aside a deed and\n                            establish an easement.

After judgment was entered, the\n                            Defendants filed a motion for new trial on the\n                            attorney’s fee award. CR 490-92. Tab F. The trial\n                            court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. CR\n                            514-16. Tab G.\n\nTrial court disposition.    The Honorable Keith Williams granted the motion for\n                            summary judgment (by an amended order) on June 11,\n                            2014. CR 412-14. Tab A. The Honorable M. Rex\n                            Emerson signed an order of severance on June 12,\n                            2014. CR 251-52. Tab D. The Amended Award of\n                            Attorney’s Fees and Final Judgment was signed by\n                            Judge Emerson on October 30, 2014. CR 505-06.

The Court should grant oral argument because\n\noral argument would significantly aid the Court in deciding this case. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 38.1(e), 39.1(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -xii-\n\f                            ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.   Because the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of conclusively establishing\n     each element of their causes of action, the trial court should not have\n     rendered a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs.\n\n2.   Because there is no summary judgment evidence of any of the deeds that are\n     necessary to an adjudication of the motion for summary judgment, the trial\n     court should not have rendered a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs.\n\n3.   The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary judgment\n     for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Deed Without Warranty did not convey\n     ownership or that the Franks had no ownership interest to convey to the\n     Lances or that the Lances do not own the disputed area or that the Deed\n     Without Warranty is an invalid cloud and burden on an easement.\n\n4.   The trial court had no legal or factual basis to render a summary judgment\n     for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Plaintiffs had an express easement in the\n     disputed area.\n\n5.   The trial court had no legal or factual basis to find that any element of a\n     Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Chapter 12 claim was conclusively\n     established.\n\n6.   The evidence does not support the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to\n     either or both the Plaintiffs and BMA.\n\n7.   The trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Plaintiffs and BMA is\n     neither equitable nor just.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -xiii-\n\fTO THE HONORABLE FOURTH COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Appellants, John A. Lance, Debra L. Lance, F.D. Franks and Helen Franks\n\n(referred to herein as “Defendants” or as “Lances” or as “Franks”), file this their\n\nBrief of Appellants, and respectfully show the Court as follows:\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      The Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment based on the Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act and Chapter 12 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\nThe Plaintiffs asserted that “[t]he testimony and documentary evidence presented\n\nto the Court at the temporary injunction held on July 16, 2012 establish the\n\nforegoing as a matter of law.” Tab B.\n\n      The Summary Judgment evidence before the trial court was expressed in the\n\nfollowing manner by the Plaintiffs: “The transcript of the hearing and the exhibits\n\nadmitted at the hearing are referenced and specified as evidence in support of this\n\nmotion.” Tab B.\n\n      In its supplement to their motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs\n\nattached the “sworn testimony given at the temporary injunction hearing held on\n\nJuly 16, 2012.” Tab C. The Plaintiffs stated that they were offering “this record\n\nin support of their motion for partial summary judgment.” Tab C. For some\n\nreason, the Plaintiffs never attached the exhibits from that hearing. Rather, the\n\nPlaintiffs simply stated that they “also offer the exhibits that were admitted at the\n\fhearing, which are currently in the possession of the court reporter.” Tab C.\n\n(emphasis supplied). The exhibits were never filed and are not contained in the\n\nsummary judgment record.\n\n      Accordingly, the Defendants will describe the facts that were addressed in\n\nthe hearing on the temporary injunction.\n\n      At the hearing, counsel for the Plaintiffs described the circumstances that\n\nbrought the parties to the trial court that day. Counsel described a dispute among\n\nthe neighbors in the Redus Point Subdivision on Medina Lake. The Plaintiffs are\n\nthe owners of Lots 1, 2 and 3. The Lances own Lot 8. CR 58.\n\n      The area below and to the side of Lot 8 is “a beachfront area, that’s below\n\nwhat’s called Elevation 1084. 1084 elevation is the approximate location—or\n\nelevation at the top of Medina Dam.” CR 58. Counsel for the Plaintiffs asserted\n\nthat elevation 1084 is the “dividing line between privately-owned property and\n\nproperty that’s owned by the water district, Bexar-Medina-Atascosa County Water\n\nImprovement District No. 1. The water district, BMA, owns everything below\n\nElevation 1084, and the private landowners own everything that’s above Elevation\n\n1084.” CR 58.1\n\n\n1\n      Plaintiffs’ counsel has taken the opposite position in a similar suit. CR 254, 274-\n      89 (“The land between elevations 1072 and 1084 is subject to occasional flooding.\n      Most of this land…is owned and controlled by private landowners, subject to\n      BMA’s right to flood the land in connection with its storage of water for irrigation\n      purposes.” CR 280).\n\n                                           -2-\n\f      Plaintiffs’ counsel further described to the trial court that when the Lances\n\nbought Lot 8 from the Franks, the Lances “also bought another piece of property,\n\n.282 acres below the 1084 line.” CR 60. Counsel’s complaint to the trial court\n\nwas that the Lances were claiming this area below elevation 1084 as their own.\n\nCR 60.\n\n      Counsel for the Defendants explained to the trial court that the Plaintiffs\n\nwant to “cross the street, come around behind my clients’ property, and they’re\n\nasking you for the right to maintain improvements there, put their boats there,\n\nparty, leave beer cans, do whatever it is that they want to on another side of—\n\nentire opposite side of this subdivision and peninsula.” CR 63. On the contrary,\n\nsaid counsel for the Defendants, the “Spettle deed was totally for the purpose for\n\nfolks to preserve those rights with respect to BMA.         That far predates the\n\nconveyance of these individual lots, which have no such reservation of rights.\n\nThere are no reservations of easement or anything of that sort in the lots\n\nconveyed—or in the deeds conveying these lots to the individual lot owners.” CR\n\n63-64.\n\n      Finally, Defendants’ counsel noted that “[w]hen the Lances bought the\n\nproperty from the Franks in 2011, they also obtained the quitclaim deed 2 to this\n\nproperty. The Lances took this dilapidated chain fence that was falling down in\n\n\n2\n      The Deed Without Warranty.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsome places and began erecting a new fence, a new fence that would actually\n\nimprove the value of the property, improve the aesthetic qualities of the\n\nneighborhood, and that’s when all of this became an issue.” CR 64.\n\n      Lemuel Sinclair, a land surveyor, testified at the hearing on behalf of the\n\nPlaintiffs. CR 67-88. Sinclair discussed the Spettle deed, a 1917 deed from\n\nTheresa Spettle to Medina Valley Irrigation Company, (MVIC, BMA’s\n\npredecessor). CR 69-71.\n\n      Sinclair also discussed a different and distinct deed, the Spettle Partition\n\ndeed. The land that this subdivision was built on in 1950 came from the lands\n\npartitioned to Mathilda Spettle Redus in 1917. CR 72-73. Sinclair testified that\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ lots, Lots 1, 2 and 3 in the subdivision, were successors in title to the\n\nlands partitioned to Spettle Redus. CR 73.\n\n      Spettle was asked his opinion as to whether the reservation contained in the\n\nSpettle deed to MVIC passed to subsequent owners such as the Plaintiffs. The trial\n\ncourt sustained the objection to this opinion. CR 74-75. Again, Sinclair was asked\n\nto confirm that “the owners of Lots 1, 2 and 3 have those three rights that were\n\nreserved in the Spettle deed because they are successors in title to the partition\n\nlands…” Again, the objection to that testimony was sustained. CR 76. There was\n\nno testimony presented on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      In discussing the Deed Without Warranty, Sinclair agreed that such a deed\n\nmeans that the grantor makes no promise of title to the grantee.\n\n             Q.    So the grantor, basically, doesn’t guarantee that\n                   they’re giving anything to the grantee, right?\n\n             A.    Right.\n\nCR 81.\n\n      On cross-examination, Sinclair admitted that there are houses on Medina\n\nLake below elevation 1084. CR 82. Sinclair also confirmed that the Plaintiffs\n\nhave lake access from their own property. CR 84-87.\n\n      Several of the Plaintiffs testified.     Gary Fest testified that the Lances’\n\nactivity in denying access to the .282-acre area interfered with the use of the dock.\n\nCR 91. Fest stated that the .282-acre area had been fenced since the 1970s, but that\n\nthis fence had become dilapidated and the neighbors were used to being able to get\n\nthrough the fence easily. The Lances were replacing that fence. CR 96. On cross-\n\nexamination, Fest said that although he was not claiming ownership of the .282-\n\nacre area, he believes he has access to any property below the 1084 line. CR 105,\n\n109-100.\n\n      Defendant, John A. Lance, testified that there had always been a clear fence\n\nand boundary line over the .282-acre area. CR 122-23. Once the Deed Without\n\nWarranty was filed, Lance paid taxes on this tract. CR 124-25. Lance testified\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat BMA did not own the property below elevation 1084, but only that the land\n\nbelow 1084 was subject to flooding. CR 127-130.\n\n      Defendant, F.D. Franks, testified that he and his wife had owned Lot 8 since\n\n1995. CR 133. Franks had been told by his predecessor, Prado, that the .282-acre\n\narea was Franks “to control.” CR 134. Prado gave him the key to the gate. CR\n\n135. On cross-examination, Franks described his reasoning for having the deed\n\nwithout warranty prepared. “A quitclaim deed has been done in several areas of\n\nMedina Lake on adjoining property below the 1084.” CR 138.\n\n            Q.     Mr. Franks, was it simply your intent to convey\n                   whatever rights you did own to the Lances?\n\n            A.     Yes, sir.\n            Q.     And you understand that there may be some\n                   dispute regarding property below the 1084 line?\n\n            A.     Yes, sir.\n            Q.     And that’s why quitclaim deeds were commonly\n                   used with respect to properties that fall below that\n                   line?\n\n            A.     Yes, sir.\n\nCR 139.\n\n      At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court noted that “[o]bviously,\n\nthere is going to need to be some other research, maybe some depositions taken as\n\nto whether or not the 1084 line is treated differently as shoreline property around\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe lake, but this is a hearing for temporary orders, temporary injunction.” CR\n\n140-41.\n\n      The trial judge, based on his prior experience in these Medina Lake disputes,\n\nnoted as well that\n\n             Obviously, there is inconsistency, and I know Mr. Miller\n             knows this because he’s been in court on Medina Lake\n             issues with me before, but there does not appear to be\n             consistency on the enforcement of shoreline rights.\n             There is a lot of metes and bounds disputes and issues,\n             and my guess is we can go around the boundary of\n             Medina Lake and find people who have done just what\n             the Lances have done and people who have done just like\n             the Plaintiffs have done.\n\nCR 142.\n\n      On January 16, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. CR 44-49. The following day, the Plaintiffs filed their supplement to\n\nthat motion attaching the reporter’s record from the hearing on the temporary\n\ninjunction, but not attaching the exhibits from the reporter’s record. CR 50-51.\n\n      On April 5, 2013, the Defendants filed their response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment subject to a previously filed motion to compel and motion to\n\ncontinue the summary judgment hearing. CR 167-181. On October 14, 2013, the\n\nHonorable Keith Williams signed the first order granting the motion for summary\n\njudgment in part. CR 182-84. In the initial order, Judge Williams found that BMA\n\nowned the land below elevation 1084 in fee. CR 182.\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      On November 20, 2013, the Defendants filed a motion for re-hearing of the\n\nsummary judgment motion. CR 185-229. With respect to the motion for re-\n\nhearing, on February 14, 2014, the Defendants filed a notice of intent to use\n\ndiscovery. CR 254-61. This evidence showed that the Plaintiffs had admitted in\n\ndiscovery responses that private property owners and BMA have ownership and/or\n\neasement rights in the area below elevation 1084. CR 256. Plaintiffs answered\n\ninterrogatories that formal legal title to the .282-acre area is “unclear.” CR 260.\n\nAlso on February 14, 2014, the Defendants filed a supplement to their motion for\n\nre-hearing. CR 262-405.\n\n      On April 22, 2014, the Defendants supplemented the motion for re-hearing\n\n(CR 406-411) and attached an affidavit from Mike Grogan, a professional land\n\nsurveyor. Grogan testified that he had reviewed the two Spettle deeds and found\n\nthat the chain of title of Redus Point subdivision goes back to the Spettle Partition\n\ndeed and not to the Spettle deed to Medina Valley Irrigation Company. Grogan\n\nalso found that “the Spettle Deed describes a 1,568.82 acre tract by metes and\n\nbounds, with no reference to the water line, flow-line or Medina Lake boundary\n\nline, and the Spettle Partition Deed does reference the water…” CR 409. Based\n\non the review of these deeds, it is Grogan’s “opinion that the title to land conveyed\n\nby the Spettle Partition Deed, based on the reference to ‘backwater’ or ‘flow-line’\n\nconveys land to the spillway elevation (BMA= 1072’, USGS –1064’) inasmuch\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fand [as] (sic) the Spettle Deed says the land will be used to ‘store water.’ And\n\nwater is stored behind the dam up to the spillway elevation.” CR 410.\n\n      Having considered this additional evidence, on June 14, 2014, the trial court\n\ndeleted its “declaration” 3, deleting the finding that the .282-acre area is owned in\n\nfee by BMA. CR 412-15.\n\n      The motion for entry of final judgment and the hearing on attorney’s fees\n\nwas conducted on September 17, 2014. RR 1. Before the hearing began, counsel\n\nfor Defendants objected to a hearing on BMA’s claim for fees because BMA did\n\nnot file a motion for summary judgment and had not been awarded any relief in the\n\nsummary judgment order. RR 6, 25-27. Defendants objected to the affidavit of\n\ncounsel for the Plaintiffs in that neither the Rogers affidavit or its supplement\n\ncomported with Section 18.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. RR 7-8.\n\nDefendants also objected to the Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with discovery\n\nrequests to produce their attorney contract and fee invoices. The fee invoices were\n\nreceived the day before the hearing rather than 30 days or more before the hearing.\n\nRR 8-11. All objections were overruled. RR 21.\n\n      Stephen Rogers, the attorney for the Plaintiffs, testified that reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees incurred by the Plaintiffs was $171,039.17 (RR 34) and\n\nthat 85% of that sum was attributable to services provided in procuring the\n\nsummary judgment order. RR 35-36. Rogers testified that the work necessary to\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fobtain the summary judgment order included responding to numerous special\n\nexceptions, an appeal on standing and a motion to disqualify counsel. These were\n\ntestified to as examples of the work that was necessary. RR 36-41.\n\n      On cross-examination, Rogers again testified that 85% of the fees were\n\n“attributable to the issues that were decided in the summary judgment and severed\n\ninto this case that we are here today on.” RR 41-44. Rogers admitted that\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims were based on law questions. RR 49-52.\n\n      Ed Hecker testified as the attorney for BMA. RR 64. Hecker redacted work\n\nhe perfomed on the Chapter 12 claims from work performed on the declaratory\n\njudgment action. RR 76-78. On cross-examination, Hecker acknowledged that the\n\nDefendants had not sued BMA (RR 79), and it was BMA that chose to file an\n\nintervention in the case. RR 82. Hecker admitted that the relief granted in the\n\nsummary judgment was based on the Plaintiffs’ motion, not based on any filing by\n\nBMA. RR 83-85. Hecker stated that some of his billing was responding to the\n\nDefendants’ motion for re-hearing of the initial summary judgment ruling. He\n\nconceded that the Defendants were successful on re-hearing.          The trial court\n\nreversed itself on the issue of BMA’s fee interest in the disputed .282-acre area.\n\nRR 86-89.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      This is an odd summary judgment. It is based on a very thin traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The summary judgment evidence consists of an\n\nearly temporary injunction hearing, at the conclusion of which the trial court\n\nremarked on the various fact questions that were presented.          The summary\n\njudgment motion references the deeds and other documents that were admitted at\n\nthe temporary injunction hearing. But those exhibits, including the deeds that form\n\nthe basis of the motion and resulting judgment, were never presented to the trial\n\ncourt as part of the summary judgment evidence. Those exhibits remained in the\n\npossession of the court reporter from the temporary injunction hearing. The deeds\n\nare not part of the summary judgment record.\n\n      The Plaintiffs sought to determine an issue of ownership without filing a\n\ntrespass to try title action. The Plaintiffs sought to set aside the subject “Deed\n\nWithout Warranty,” without filing a suit to set aside the deed. Tab I. But beyond\n\nthese procedural errors, the Plaintiffs failed to prove the issue of ownership as a\n\nmatter of law. The summary judgment evidence (the testimony elicited at the\n\ntemporary injunction hearing) does not establish title to the disputed area. Nor did\n\nthe trial court determine ownership. Indeed, the trial court struck through its\n\nownership finding. Tab A.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f      Nor can the summary judgment be affirmed based on findings of an express\n\neasement. The Deed from Spettle to MVIC (which contains the language relied on\n\nby Plaintiffs) is void for lack of a valid legal description. The Deed from Spettle to\n\nMVIC is not in Plaintiffs’ chain of title; hence as a stranger to that deed, the\n\nPlaintiffs cannot rely on anything contained, referenced, reserved or granted\n\ntherein. Aside from these dispositive principles, the language in the deed does not\n\ncreate an express easement because (1) the language does comply with the statute\n\nof frauds (there is no description of the easement’s location or degree of certainty\n\nsuch that it can be located on the ground); (2) no dominant or servient estate is\n\nidentified in the language; (3) the language is consistent with the creation of a\n\nlicense or an easement in gross; (4) nothing in the Spettle Deed mentions the right\n\nto cross over or linger on and the deed does not give any rights with regard to\n\nanybody else’s property; and, (5) the Plaintiffs’ own deeds are silent as to any\n\neasement rights.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\nI.    The Plaintiffs had the burden to conclusively establish each element of\n      their causes of action.\n\n      Appellate courts review a trial court’s decision to grant no evidence and\n\ntraditional motions for summary judgment de novo.

Nor did the trial court find that BMA has title\n\nto the disputed area. The Deed Without Warranty has not been set aside and\n\nremains a valid deed.\n\n      More importantly, the Texas Supreme Court has made it clear that only the\n\ngrantor in a deed may seek to have it set aside.

This Court held that where the complaining party was not\n\nthe grantor, he had no standing to pursue a claim in connection with the\n\ncomplained-of deed. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3332318</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *4.\n\n      Under the trial court’s order, Plaintiffs can challenge anyone’s deed. Under\n\nthis order, Plaintiffs do not have to be the grantor in a deed to challenge a deed.\n\nAny person can challenge the deed of another property owner to have themselves\n\ndeclared owner. But Texas law does not allow a non-grantor to bring a cause of\n\naction to have a deed set aside. Plaintiffs are entitled to bring a claim for an\n\nexpress easement to the disputed tract, but they are not entitled to have the deed\n\nfrom the Franks to the Lances set aside. And until such a suit to set aside a deed is\n\nsuccessful, a declaration of title is unavailable.\n\nV.    The ownership of the disputed area remains disputed and as long as\n      that dispute remains, there can be no determination of title.\n\n      What facts were conclusively proved at the hearing on the temporary\n\ninjunction?\n\n      There was testimony that the Plaintiffs have constructed or placed their\n\npersonal property below elevation 1084 in an area of the lake that is partially\n\nenclosed with a fence constructed by the Defendants’ predecessor. There was\n\n                                          -19-\n\ftestimony that the Lances intended to replace the dilapidated fence and that doing\n\nso would effectively keep the Plaintiffs from making use of that area of the lake\n\nbelow elevation 1084.\n\n      There was testimony that the Plaintiffs have lake access from their own lots\n\nbut that access to the lake from their own lots is more difficult than from the\n\nDefendants’ lot. There was testimony that there is no lake to access from any lots\n\nbecause of the drought.\n\n      There was testimony from land surveyor, Lemuel Sinclair, Plaintiffs’ expert,\n\nthat described the parties’ subdivision as having originated from lands in a\n\npartition deed not from lands conveyed in the deed from Spettle to MVIC. Sinclair\n\nwas not permitted to testify as to whether, in his opinion, any reservations passed\n\nto subsequent owners such as the Plaintiffs.\n\n      Although there was a lot of lawyer talk about the Defendants’ inability to\n\nassert exclusive control to the area below elevation 1084, Sinclair testified that\n\nthere are a number of homes that have been built below elevation 1084 along\n\nMedina Lake’s (former) shoreline. The fact that property is being exclusively\n\ncontrolled by private property owners below elevation 1084, rather than by BMA,\n\nconflicts with the Plaintiffs’ testimony that they believe they have access to lake\n\nproperty at any location if the property is below elevation 1084. These facts also\n\ncorroborate Mr. Franks’ testimony that homes have been built below elevation\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f1084. Based on his own experience handling Medina Lake cases, Judge Williams\n\nalso appreciated that this was an ongoing, and not yet resolved, controversy.\n\n      Sinclair testified that the Deed Without Warranty, like a quitclaim deed,\n\nconveys no promise of title. Mr. Franks understood this definition and testified\n\nthat it was his intent to convey whatever rights, if any, he had to that area to the\n\nLances. Mr. Franks understood that that was a common practice at Medina Lake\n\nwith respect to properties that fall below elevation 1084.         Judge Williams\n\nacknowledged as much after the hearing.\n\n      It is obvious that a deed-without-warranty could not be intended to create an\n\nappearance of a conveyance of ownership because the very definition of a deed-\n\nwithout-warranty precludes such intent. And such a deed could not be used or\n\npresented with an intent to injure because, again, a deed-without-warranty is, by\n\ndefinition, not a statement that title is being promised.\n\n      Nothing was conclusively proven at the hearing on the issues of ownership\n\nto the disputed area or the easement rights of the Plaintiffs to the disputed area.\n\nJudge Williams acknowledged as much after the hearing. CR 67-142.\n\n      The hearing established nothing and the deeds are not part of the summary\n\njudgment record. Because the Plaintiffs failed to prove they were entitled to\n\nsummary judgment by establishing each element of their respective claims as a\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fmatter of law, this summary judgment must be reversed.

The Spettle Deed is void because it does not contain the nucleus of a\n      valid description.\n\n      The validity of the 1917 deed from the Spettles to BMA, through which\n\nPlaintiffs claim an express easement, is controlled by the finding of this Court\n\nwhich construed another 1917 deed from the Spettles to BMA’s predecessor. The\n\nholding, in that opinion, is that the deed is void because the deed did not contain\n\n“….the nucleus of a valid description.” Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Counties Water\n\nImprovement District No. 1 v. Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      In Wallace, the Fourth Court explained that:\n\n             [T]he Warranty Deed from Joseph F. Spettle, et al to The\n             Medina Valley Irrigation Company, dated January 18,\n             1917, and of record in Volume G-1, Pages 308-313,\n             Deed Records of Bandera County, Texas, which is an\n             indispensable link in Plaintiff's chain of title, is not\n             sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The beginning\n             point of such tract is described merely as “point ‘2’ ” and\n             there are no means or data contained in the description by\n             which such point may be located on the ground with\n             reasonable certainty. The remaining calls comprising the\n             description is for courses and distances without reference\n             to any objects, monuments or existing writings. None of\n             such calls can be located on the ground without reference\n             to the beginning point. Because of the insufficiency of\n             the field notes, the only descriptive data contained in the\n             Deed are that the tract contains 13.76 acres, more or less,\n             and is off the South side of Survey No. 288, E.\n\n                                        -22-\n\f             Pennington, in Bandera County, Texas. Such description\n             does not furnish within itself, or by reference to some\n             other existing writing, the means or data by which the\n             tract may be identified with reasonable certainty.\n             Because the Deed does not contain the nucleus of a\n             valid description, it is void.\n\nId. at 554 (emphasis supplied).\n\n      The description of land in the subject Spettle Deed to BMA employs an\n\nidentical technique and description as contained in the deed this Court found to be\n\nvoid. The description in the subject Spettle Deed to BMA used, as points of\n\nbeginning, “point 0,” “point 1,” “point 2,” etc. The remaining calls are for course\n\nand distances without references to any object, monuments or existing writings.\n\nAnd, like the previously adjudicated Spettle Deed, no calls for the Spettle Deed to\n\nBMA can be located on the ground without reference to the beginning point.\n\nVoiding this deed precludes the need to consider whether the language in the deed\n\ngives rise to an easement.\n\nVII. There can be no express easement based on language in a conveyance\n     that is not in the Plaintiffs’ chain of title.\n\n      A purchaser is bound by the terms of instruments in his chain of title.\n\nInwood N.

(CR 409-10). Said Partition Deed contains\n\nno reference to any type of reservation, grant or license with regard to usage of\n\nwater, access to the Lake or any other such matter. There is nothing to support\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim to an express easement based on a deed which is not in their chain\n\nof title.\n\n       Focusing on the importance of a property owner seeking to claim rights of\n\nan express easement from an earlier document, Greenwood v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2012, pet. denied) is instructive. In construing the\n\neasement rights of the current holder, the Amarillo court of appeals looked at a\n\n1964 document creating the express easement, and examined each conveyance in\n\nthe chain of title leading up to the current easement holder’s 2009 deed. Id. at 109-\n\n110.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f       Plaintiffs have identified no law to support their claim to an express\n\neasement based on language in a conveyance that is not in their chain of title. This\n\nis fatal to their claim of an express easement.\n\nVIII. For a host of reasons, the Spettle Deed does not establish an express\n      easement in the lands conveyed to MVIC.\n\n       The basic principles of contract construction and interpretation are applied\n\nwhen considering an express easement’s terms.

Civ. App.—Fort Worth\n\n1966, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n       The language in the Spettle Deed on which Plaintiffs rely for their express\n\neasement is:\n\n               (a)   The right to use the waters in the reservoir for\n                     domestic purposes;\n               (b)   The right to use the waters in the reservoir for\n                     bathing, boating, fishing, and hunting; and,\n\n               (c)   The right to construct upon the edges of the\n                     reservoir at their own peril and expense and\n                     without any liability of the grantors for the\n                     destruction thereof by water or otherwise, such\n                     improvements as may be necessary and incident to\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\f                   the exercise of the privileges above reserved by the\n                   grantors, their heirs and assigns, which privileges\n                   are to be exercised by said parties only to the\n                   extent and in the proportion which the acreage\n                   above described bears to the total acreage under\n                   the flow line of said reservoir.\n\n      i.    The language does not comply with the Statute of Frauds.\n      The first deficiency in the above language creating an express easement is\n\nthat is does not comply with the statute of frauds. Express easements must comply\n\nwith the statute of frauds, which requires a description of the easement’s location.\n\nSeverance v. Patterson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (Tex. 2012).\n\n      The description of an easement requires a sufficient degree of certainty such\n\nthat a surveyor can go upon the land and locate the easement from such\n\ndescription. Vrabel v. Donahoe Creek Watershed Authority, 545 S.W.53, 54 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—Austin 1977, no writ). If the easement does not sufficiently identify a\n\ndescription of its location, then it must fail and will be declared void. Id. The\n\nlanguage relied upon by Plaintiffs is devoid of any description as to where the\n\neasement lies. Worse, there is no description that would enable a surveyor to\n\nlocate the easement.\n\n      For the statute of frauds to be satisfied, the intent of the parties, the essential\n\nterms of the easement, and an adequate description of the easement’s location must\n\nbe apparent from the face of the document, without reference to extrinsic evidence.\n\nIf the court cannot determine these elements with reasonable certainty, then no\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fexpress easement is conveyed. Cummins v. Travis County Water Control and\n\nImprovement District No. 17, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1369812\"><a href=\"/opinion/1369812/cummins-v-travis-county-water-dist-no-17/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no\n\npet.).\n\n         The language relied upon by Plaintiffs in the Spettle deed is silent as to\n\nwhere the claimed easement is located. The language does not even attempt to\n\nlocate the easement to the degree where a surveyor could go upon the land and\n\nlocate the easement. For these reasons alone, Plaintiffs’ claim for an express\n\neasement fails.\n\n         ii.    There is no language creating a dominant and servient estate.\n         To create an express easement that runs with the land, “there must be a\n\ndominant estate and a servient estate….. This concept is in contrast to an easement\n\nin gross which attaches to an individual and is not dependent upon the existence of\n\na dominant estate in land. Alley v. Carleton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1867).” Drye v.

The language relied upon by\n\nPlaintiffs contains no reference to a dominant or servient estate.\n\n         iii.   At best, the language creates a nontransferable license or\n                easement in gross.\n         The right to go upon the land of another for pleasure and recreation, such as\n\nsought in the subject suit, is most typically classified as either (1) a license, as a\n\nlicense to picnic or to hunt, or (2) an easement in gross, which is an interest in\n\nland, usually attached to a person but not attached or appurtenant to the land of the\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fowner of the right. Ordinarily licenses are revocable; and ordinarily, easements in\n\ngross are not transferable or assignable. Drye v. Eagle Rock Ranch, Inc. 364\n\nS.W.2d at 203 (Tex. 1963). The language relied upon by Plaintiffs creates a\n\nlicense or an easement in gross, not an easement appurtenant.\n\n      iv.    The language does not contain explicit terms of the easement.\n      An express easement must be explicit as to the essential terms of the\n\neasement, and an adequate description of the easement's location must be apparent\n\nfrom the face of the document. Cummins v. Travis County Water Control and\n\nImprovement District No. 17, 175 S.W.3d at 51.\n\n      In contrast, the trial court’s ruling simply states: “Plaintiffs own an express\n\neasement in the disputed area.” Perhaps, understandably, no mention is made of\n\nthe terms of the easement or its location since none of such is identified in the\n\npurported easement granting language in the Spettle deed.\n\n      v.     Rights under an express easement are not implied.\n      No rights under an express easement are implied. Coleman v. Forister, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1661351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1661351/coleman-v-forister/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 903 (Tex. 1974).        Therefore, since the language relied upon by\n\nPlaintiff is silent as to any rights to use, cross, recreate on or ingress and egress\n\nover any real property, no such rights may be implied. There is no support for the\n\ntrial court’s holding that Plaintiffs have an easement in the disputed area.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f      vi.    None of Plaintiffs’ deeds contain any easement language.\n      Critically, none of Plaintiffs’ deeds contain any easement language which\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court would find relevant. Drye v. Eagle Rock Ranch, Inc.,\n\n364 S.W.2d at 200-01 (“It is significant however, that none of the deeds purported\n\nto grant the purchaser any rights or easement over the ranch or over any property\n\noutside the purchaser’s own lot.”).\n\n      Any one of the above reasons defeats the Plaintiffs’ claim of an express\n\neasement. No construction of the language proferred by the Plaintiffs provides any\n\nassistance to their easement claim. Indeed, every construction fails. The Plaintiffs\n\nhave no claim of an express easement.\n\nIX.   A deed cannot be a cloud on an easement.\n\n      In addition to the errors of fact and law contained in the declarations in the\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment order, the order also contains its share of\n\nabsurdities. For instance, declaration 7 states: “The Deed Without Warranty is an\n\ninvalid cloud and burden on the easement rights of plaintiffs.” CR 413.\n\n      Defendants find no such cause of action in Texas jurisprudence. A cloud on\n\ntitle exists when an outstanding claim or encumbrance is shown, which on its face,\n\nif valid, would affect or impair the title to the owner of the property. Hahn v. Love,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). The\n\nPlaintiffs are not claiming to be the owners of the disputed area. If an easement is\n\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fvalid, it is irrelevant who owns the land. Because it is irrelevant who owns the\n\nland, there is no such thing as a deed causing an invalid cloud on an easement.\n\nX.    The Plaintiffs did not obtain a summary judgment on their CPRC\n      Chapter 12 claim, but there is no support for the favorable findings the\n      Plaintiffs received in the trial court’s summary judgment order.\n\n      “The party asserting a claim under Section 12.002 has the burden to prove\n\nthe requisite elements of the statute.” Aland v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1765896\"><a href=\"/opinion/1765896/aland-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2008, no pet.). The summary judgment order does not find for the\n\nPlaintiffs on every element of their Chapter 12 claim. CR 414. The order does not\n\nfind that the Defendants intended the Plaintiffs to suffer financial injury in\n\nviolation of CPRC Section 12.002(a)(3).        But there is also no support for\n\ndeclarations the judgment makes as to other elements of this claim. In the interest\n\nof judicial economy, this Court should make that determination now so that the\n\nDefendants, on remand, will not be met with having to defend a Chapter 12 claim.\n\n      The Plaintiffs do not own an express easement in the disputed area,\n\ntherefore, they do not have standing under CPRC Section 12.003(a)(8). But for the\n\nreasons discussed in Section IX of the Argument, even if the Plaintiffs did have an\n\nexpress easement, they would not have standing under Chapter 12. The Plaintiffs’\n\neasement rights cannot be impaired by any owner or by any deed. Who owns the\n\ndisputed area does not matter.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f      The trial court found that as a matter of law the Defendants intended to\n\ncreate the appearance of an actual conveyance of ownership in the disputed area.\n\nCR 414. But it is undisputed that the Deed Without Warranty, like a quitclaim\n\ndeed, makes no promise of title. That is definitional, not factual. The very nature\n\nof a deed without warranty negates the trial court’s finding. The Plaintiffs’ own\n\nexpert corroborates this understanding.\n\n             Q.       A deed without warranty means that the grantor\n                      makes no promise of title to the grantee, right?\n             A.       That’s right.\n             Q.       So the grantor, basically, doesn’t guarantee that\n                      they’re giving anything to the grantee, right?\n             A.       Right.\n\nCR 81.\n\n      Given that no promise or guarantee of ownership is being made, how can it\n\nbe that the Defendants intended to convey ownership as a matter of law? As noted\n\nby Judge Williams, he assumes many people along the Medina Lake shoreline\n\nhave done the same and there was testimony as well to this effect. CR 138-39,\n\n142. None of the trial court’s findings with regard to Chapter 12 were established\n\nas a matter of law.\n\nXI.   There is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the fees\n      awarded to the Plaintiffs and BMA; nor is it equitable and just to award\n      them.\n\n      On June 12, 2014, the trial court granted the Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nSeverance, Attorney’s Fees, and Final Judgment. Tab D. In that order, the trial\n\n                                          -31-\n\fcourt stated that the matters addressed in the Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion\n\nwere severed. The matters addressed in the summary judgment motion pertain\n\nsolely to the temporary injunction hearing.\n\n      The trial court also ordered that the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees\n\nconnected with the severed matter were to be set for a hearing. Tab D. Thus, the\n\nattorney’s fees that were subject to being awarded would be fees for professional\n\nservices connected with the preparation for and attendance at the temporary\n\ninjunction hearing and the preparation of the motion for summary judgment. All\n\nother issues, and the professional services the parties have required for those other\n\nissues, remain pending in the original cause number or were unnecessary for this\n\nsummary judgment proceeding.\n\n      The Supreme Court has described the proper analysis for awarding fees\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act. The Act entrusts attorney fee awards to the\n\ntrial court's sound discretion, subject to the requirements that any fees awarded be\n\nreasonable and necessary, which are matters of fact, and to the additional\n\nrequirements that fees be equitable and just, which are matters of law. It is an\n\nabuse of discretion for a trial court to rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without\n\nregard to guiding legal principles, e.g., Goode v. Shoukfeh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788371\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788371/goode-v-shoukfeh/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 446\n\n(Tex. 1997), or to rule without supporting evidence, Beaumont Bank v.

Had there been no summary judgment, it is hard to\n\nimagine the Plaintiffs and BMA moving for their attorney’s fees. But in weighing\n\nall the evidence, this Court must look at the work that would have been necessary\n\nto develop the evidence that was used to support the Plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. The only evidence that was used was the reporter’s record\n\nfrom the hearing on the temporary injunction. The documents that would have\n\nbeen before the trial court on the motion for summary judgment had they been\n\nfiled, were, as Mr. Rogers testified, already in the possession of the Plaintiffs at the\n\ntime they filed suit.\n\n      Both the attorney for the Plaintiffs and the attorney for BMA acknowledged\n\nthe need to segregate their fees and both of them testified that they did so. Rogers\n\ntestified that 85% of his fees were for services related to the summary judgment\n\nissues. Hecker testified that he redacted any work he did related to claims under\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fCPRC Chapter 12. RR 76-78. But how can it be equitable and just for these\n\nparties to recover for the professional services of their attorneys that played no part\n\nin the motion for summary judgment?\n\n         The only services that would be reasonable and necessary would be the\n\nservices provided in developing the evidence and preparing for the temporary\n\ninjunction, the preparation of the motion and supplemental motion for summary\n\njudgment and the temporary injunction and summary judgment hearings\n\nthemselves. The motion for summary judgment is based solely on the temporary\n\ninjunction hearing. The fee statements and attorney testimony upon which the trial\n\ncourt based its award envelop a much larger litigation universe than the work that\n\nwas necessary for the motion for summary judgment.\n\n         In the case of BMA, the equities and justness of the fee award on its behalf\n\nare wholly lacking.      On numerous occasions, trial counsel for the Plaintiffs\n\nobjected to the trial court hearing testimony from counsel for BMA about BMA’s\n\nattorney’s fees. RR 6, 25-27. After all, BMA had chosen to intervene in the\n\nlawsuit. The Defendants had not sued BMA. RR 82. BMA was not yet a party at\n\nthe time of the temporary injunction hearing. BMA did not file the motion for\n\nsummary judgment that led to the summary judgment order and subsequent\n\nhearing on attorney’s fees. BMA, in fact, has yet to obtain any relief from the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\f      Even some of the issues subsumed within the summary judgment order\n\npertain to claims that cannot be brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act. The\n\nclaims to set aside the Deed Without Warranty and claims concerning the\n\nDefendants’ ownership can only be brought as a Trespass to Try Title. Attorney’s\n\nfees are not recoverable for a claim to quiet title. See, e.g., Florey v.

Disputing the title to that area is unnecessary to the adjudication of\n\nthe asserted easement. Indeed, the Plaintiffs do not have standing to set aside the\n\ndeed between the Franks and the Lances. Issues of ownership are of no legal\n\nconsequence to a holder of easement rights. Unfortunately, the parties have had to\n\nengage in needless litigation because of the Plaintiffs’ insistence on asserting these\n\nirrelevant claims.\n\n      The relevant question is whether the Plaintiffs have easement rights, not who\n\nis the owner of the disputed area. BMA’s presence, therefore, is not needed nor\n\nwas it solicited. Again, it is unfortunate that the Defendants have had to expend\n\ntime and resources engaged in a dispute with BMA.\n\n      But the Defendants have shown that the Plaintiffs do not have easement\n\nrights because the relevant deed is void for lack of a valid legal description,\n\nbecause the relevant conveyance is not in the Plaintiffs’ chain of title and because\n\nthe language does not comply with the statute of frauds, does not create a dominant\n\nand servient estate, does not contain explicit terms of an easement and does not\n\ncontain easement language.\n\n      The attorney’s fees awarded to the Plaintiffs and BMA cannot be justified\n\neither based on a review of all of the evidence or as a matter of equity and justness.\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fThe summary judgment order itself is something less than a model of coherence\n\nwhen due consideration is given to the applicable law and facts. Nothing has been\n\nconclusively proven. The Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof and the\n\nsummary judgment order cannot stand.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      For all of these reasons, the Defendants pray that the summary judgment be\n\nreversed and rendered, or in the alternative, remanded, that the order awarding\n\nattorney’s fees, court costs and interest be reversed and rendered, or in the\n\nalternative, remanded, and that the Defendants have such other and further relief to\n\nwhich they are entitled at law or in equity.\n\n                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                 Cynthia Cox Payne\n                                 Texas Bar No. 24001935\n                                 1118 Main Street\n                                 Bandera, Texas 78003\n                                 (830) 796-7030 – Phone\n                                 (830) 796-7945 – Fax\n                                 cpayne@paynelawfirm.net\n                                 /s/Dan Pozza\n                                 Dan Pozza\n                                 State Bar No. 16224800\n                                 239 East Commerce Street\n                                 San Antonio, Texas 78205\n                                 (210) 226-8888 – Phone\n                                 (210) 224-6373 – Fax\n                                 danpozza@yahoo.com\n                                 ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANTS\n                                 JOHN A.

The Defendants seek a new trial on the award of attorney fees,\n\n                                                 II.\n\n        The Court should grant a new trial because it erred by making the following rulings:\n\n                The Court erred in awarding $90,000 as attorney fees to the\n                Plaintiffs and against the Dcfondants and in awarding $31,025 as\n                attorney fees to Third Party BMA against the Defendants because\n                there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to support this award.\n                The evidence is insufficient to find that the amounts awarded are\n\n\nMotion for New Trial                                                                      Page 1\n\n\n\n                                                490\n\f                 reasonable or were necessary in the prosecution of this lawsuit.\n                 The conclusory nature of the evidence presented will not support\n                 the attorney fees award.\n\n                Similarly, there is no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to suppott\n                the award of appellate attorney fees because the evidence\n                presented was conclusory and the award is speculative. The\n                evidence is insufficient to find that the amount of appellate\n                attorney fees awarded are reasonable or necessary.\n\n                The court erred in admitting, over proper objection, the\n                documentary and other evidence used by the Plaintiffs and BMA to\n                support the award of attorney fees.\n\n         For these reasons, the Defendants ask the Court to grant a new trial.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              Cynthia Cox Payne\n                                              Texas Bar No. 24001935\n                                              P.O.
