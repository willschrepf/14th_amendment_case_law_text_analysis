More than\n13 years later, defendant Michael Frank Goodwin was arrested in Orange County for the\nmurders. After the Orange County prosecution was dismissed for improper venue,\ndefendant was prosecuted in Los Angeles County, and in January 2007, a jury convicted\nhim of the first degree murder of both victims, and found true special allegations of\nmultiple murders and that the murders were committed by means of lying in wait.\n       The prosecution adduced evidence of bitter lawsuits between defendant and\nMr. Thompson over business matters in the three years preceding the murders, lawsuits\nthat ended badly for defendant. Many witnesses testified to defendant’s expressed hatred\nof Mr. Thompson and defendant’s numerous threats, repeated to many witnesses over a\nlengthy period of time, that he intended to kill Mr. Thompson and hurt his family. There\nwas eyewitness testimony placing defendant, with binoculars, in a car (with another\nunidentified man) parked in the Thompson neighborhood a few days before the murders.\nAnd there was evidence defendant and his wife liquidated assets and left the country on a\nnewly purchased yacht five months after the murders.\n       The defense case challenged the eyewitness identification of the man in the parked\ncar and tried to prove the murders were the result of a robbery gone wrong rather than a\ncontract “hit,” and that investigators made numerous errors and improperly focused their\nefforts on defendant rather than undertaking an unbiased search for the truth.\n       Defendant challenges his convictions on many grounds. He contends the case\nshould have been dismissed, or the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office should have\nbeen recused, or the two prosecutors should have been removed, because of the seizure,\nretention and review of attorney-client privileged documents.\n       He contends the evidence was insufficient for conviction, claiming the eyewitness\nidentification of defendant as the man in the parked car was not credible evidence of a\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fconnection between defendant and the killers or of any agreement to murder the\nThompsons.\n       He contends the long delay in prosecuting him was unjustified and prejudicial,\nviolating his state and federal constitutional rights to due process of law.\n       He asserts a possible Pitchess1 violation.\n       He asserts error in the admission of expert testimony on financial transactions that\noccurred after Mickey Thompson won a large judgment against defendant.\n       He asserts the trial court improperly admitted evidence that Mr. Thompson\nexpressed fear of defendant, evidence of defendant’s bad character, and evidence of\nMr. Thompson’s good character.\n       He contends the trial court erred in excluding evidence, including evidence of\npotential third party culpability; evidence that Mickey Thompson had purchased a large\nquantity of gold just before the murders; and evidence that another individual had failed\nthree polygraph examinations but nevertheless investigators failed to pursue him as a\nsuspect.\n       He asserts error in giving a conspiracy instruction; error in instructing the jury it\ncould consider a witness’s level of certainty when evaluating eyewitness identification;\nand error in instructing the jury it could consider defendant’s departure from the country\non a yacht five months after the murders as evidence of flight and consciousness of guilt.\n       He asserts multiple forms of prosecutorial misconduct.\n       He contends dismissal is required because of outrageous government conduct\n“from the beginning of the investigation to verdict,” claiming among other things that\nMickey Thompson’s sister, Collene Campbell, improperly influenced the investigation\nthrough her personal connections with the Orange County District Attorney.\n       And he asserts reversal is required based on the cumulative effect of multiple\nerrors in the case.\n\n\n\n1      Pitchess v. Superior Court (1974) 11 Cal.3d 531 (Pitchess).\n\n                                              3\n\f      Our review of the record discloses no prejudicial error, and we affirm the\njudgment.\n                                        FACTS\n1. Background\n      Mickey Thompson was a well-known race car driver who set a land speed record\nin his youth. By the 1980’s, Mr. Thompson was running a successful sports promotion\ncompany that sponsored indoor stadium races, principally with off-road, four-wheeled\nvehicles. Defendant ran a similar business, Stadium Motor Sports Corporation,\npromoting stadium motorcycle racing. In 1984, the two men entered into a business\nventure together to promote stadium motor sports events. The deal involved a stock\ntransfer agreement with the parties combining their businesses and sharing profits and\nlosses, 70 percent to defendant and 30 percent to Mr. Thompson.\n      Within months, the business relationship deteriorated. Defendant refused to\nadvance monies for an event according to the 70/30 formula, and then claimed\nMr. Thompson had defaulted, entitling him (defendant) to take over Mr. Thompson’s\ncompany.2 Mr. Thompson sued defendant and his company in October 1984. In\nFebruary 1986, the trial court entered judgment for Mr. Thompson totaling over $790,000\nin damages, prejudgment interest and attorney fees.\n      In the years after the litigation began, Mr. Thompson continued to successfully\npromote motor sports events in various arenas, while defendant’s business suffered.\nDefendant had originated the idea of staging motorcycle events at the stadium in\nAnaheim, and had done so successfully for years. But after 1987, Gregory Smith, the\n\n2       Charles Stewart Linkletter, who worked for defendant in 1984 while the business\nventure with Mr. Thompson was being negotiated, overheard a conversation between\ndefendant and another executive of defendant’s company while driving them to\ndefendant’s Laguna office. Mr. Linkletter described the conversation as a 45-minute\ndiatribe by defendant to the effect that “he was going to screw Mickey out of his\nbusiness” and “rip him off.” Then defendant told Mr. Linkletter, “Stew, if you ever say a\nword about this conversation to anybody, I will fucking kill you.” A few days or weeks\nlater, Mr. Linkletter drove from Laguna to the Thompson residence to get\nMr. Thompson’s signature on a contract.\n\n                                            4\n\fAnaheim Stadium executive director, stopped doing business with defendant and hired\nMr. Thompson and another company to produce all of Anaheim’s motor sports events,\nincluding the event defendant previously produced. (One of several reasons for the\nchange was that defendant’s company was in bankruptcy.) Defendant was very upset\nwhen he received the news that his proposal for those events had been rejected in favor of\nMr. Thompson. Anaheim Stadium executives announced the change at a press\nconference in August 1987, and the events held in January 1988 were very successful.\n       Defendant had held an exclusive contract for motor sports events at the Rose Bowl\nin 1985 and 1986, but the Pasadena City Council selected Mr. Thompson’s company to\nhold an event in May 1987, which also made defendant very angry. Mr. Thompson was\nalso selected to run an event in the summer of 1988, but the murders prevented that.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson’s vigorous attempts to collect on his judgment against\ndefendant were largely unsuccessful. Mr. Thompson’s lawyers prevented defendant from\nusing private sureties to satisfy the appellate bond requirement, but were not able to find\nany assets, which appeared to have been transferred. In September 1986, defendant\nchanged the name of his company and filed for bankruptcy protection. In November\n1986, defendant filed for personal bankruptcy.\n       Mr. Thompson’s lawyer, Philip Bartinetti, described the litigation as one of “the\nmost vigorously contested I’ve ever been involved in.” Another of Mr. Thompson’s\nlawyers, who was responsible for attempting to collect the judgment, described the\nlitigation as “absolutely beyond a doubt the most bitter and contentiously fought lawsuit\nI’ve ever been involved in.”\n       The judgment for Mr. Thompson was affirmed on appeal and the Supreme Court\ndenied review on January 29, 1988, a few months before the murders. In another lawsuit\ndefendant filed in Orange County against Mr. Thompson and his company, the court\nordered summary judgment in favor Mr. Thompson on March 2, 1988, about two weeks\nbefore the murders.\n       After the bankruptcy filings in September and November 1986, Mr. Thompson\nhad wanted to settle the matter, and there were extensive settlement negotiations.\n\n                                             5\n\fApparent deals were reached a dozen times, but then defendant “would change something\nat the last minute and it would fall apart.” Mr. Thompson’s lawyer concluded defendant\nwas not negotiating in good faith.\n       After the bankruptcy filing of defendant’s company, now named Entertainment\nSpecialties, Inc. (ESI), the bankruptcy examiner recommended appointment of a trustee\nfor ESI. Jeffrey Coyne was appointed trustee in late June 1987. He discovered “there\nwas no operating company to run,” as “the operating part of the company had been sold\nby E.S.I.” to a company named Supercross, Inc. (SXI), a company owned and operated\nby defendant’s wife and a man named Charles Clayton. When he examined the books\nand the transfer to SXI, Mr. Coyne found “lots of gaping holes” and determined that\nmuch of what he saw in ESI and the transfer to SXI “was all done for the purpose of\nmoving the business without paying the creditors,” the most vocal and the most interested\nof whom was Mr. Thompson. Mr. Coyne discovered that SXI was in default on\npayments to ESI for assets transferred to SXI, and believed the activity of defendant, his\nwife, ESI and SXI to be fraud affecting Mr. Thompson’s rights as a creditor, as ESI’s\nprimary assets had been shifted away.\n       Mr. Coyne took steps to recover the assets, and SXI eventually paid $385,000 of\nthe outstanding $500,000 owed. Mr. Coyne pursued recovery of the remaining amount\nand refused to acquiesce in defendant’s efforts to have various bankruptcy estate assets\npaid to his wife and parents. At a meeting a few weeks before the murders, defendant,\ntrembling and in a “black rage,” approached within inches of Mr. Coyne’s face and said,\n“You better lighten up or things will get bad,” and “If you fuck up my life, I’ll fuck up\nyours.” Describing his experience with the ESI bankruptcy, Mr. Coyne said it was “the\nhighest level I had ever seen of acrimony, anger, intensity, resentment and rage.”\n2. Defendant’s Threats Against Mr. Thompson\n       We summarize now the evidence of the multiple occasions on which defendant\nexpressed his hatred of Mr. Thompson and his intent to kill him during the years\npreceding the murders.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       a. William and Nina Wilson\n       In January or February 1988, William and Nina Wilson hosted dinner at their\nhome for defendant and his wife. (Mr. Wilson was general manager of Jack Murphy\nStadium in San Diego, and had also managed the Rose Bowl; he had worked with both\nMr. Thompson and defendant on various motor sports promotions.) When Mr. Wilson\nasked defendant how he was doing, defendant replied, “Terrible.” Defendant was angry\nand said: “Fucking Thompson is killing me. He’s taking everything I’ve got. He’s\ndestroying me. I’m going to take him out.” When Mr. Wilson responded, “Nobody wins\nthat one. Mickey’s dead and you’re in prison,” defendant replied, “Oh, no,” and “I’m too\nsmart for that. They’ll never catch me.” Nina Wilson heard the conversation and\ncorroborated her husband’s account, saying that defendant said, “I just hate him,” and\nrepeated, “I’m going to take him out.” Both the Wilsons believed defendant was serious.\nMr. Wilson was “very upset” and Ms. Wilson was “shock[ed].” When he saw how\nshocked the Wilsons were, defendant said, “Well, you know I’m just kidding. I could\nnever do anything like that.”\n       b. Gregory Smith\n       Mr. Smith, the Anaheim Stadium executive, was subpoenaed to testify at a\nbankruptcy court hearing in 1987. This was at a time when decisions were being made or\nhad recently been made about the award of the Anaheim motorcycle event to\nMr. Thompson. Mr. Smith was sitting at the back of the courtroom before the hearing\nwhen defendant sat down behind him and said, “You don’t know what you’re doing to\nme. You’ll be sorry for this. I’ll be back.” Mr. Smith considered defendant’s statement\nthreatening. He had had several conversations with defendant before, and in every one,\ndefendant was “unhappy” and “mad that we would consider not having him come back\nand put on the supercross event.” Defendant was “confrontational and very, very upset,”\nbut the courtroom conversation “was the first where I considered it threatening when I\nwas being told that I would regret this decision.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       c. Scott Hernandez\n       Scott Hernandez worked for defendant’s company from the spring of 1985 to late\n1987, when defendant closed the office. The office walls were thin, and the offices of\ndefendant and Mr. Hernandez shared a wall, so Mr. Hernandez could overhear\ndiscussions in defendant’s adjoining office. In late 1987, Mickey Thompson’s name\ncame up frequently and was a source of tension in the office. “When Mickey Thompson\nwas brought up by [defendant], it was usually in a rageful manner. Not geared towards\nthe office personnel, but him expressing his anger and frustration . . . .”\n       On one occasion, Mr. Hernandez heard defendant on the telephone with his\nattorneys in the Thompson case, and then heard a ruckus that “sounded like books flying,\nhitting the wall, and [defendant] going into a rage.” Mr. Hernandez heard defendant say,\n“I’ll kill that mother fucker. I’ll kill that mother fucker.” Mr. Hernandez described\ndefendant’s voice level as “in anger, just livid anger.” (In 2002, Mr. Hernandez told a\ndetective that this incident occurred in February or March 1987, rather than late 1987.)\n       d. Cheryl Sarantis\n       Cheryl Sarantis was an employee of defendant’s company in 1986 and 1987, until\nthe office closed, working on advertising and marketing. She heard defendant “ranting\nand raving” about Mr. Thompson on a regular basis, every day that defendant was in the\noffice. On one occasion, she heard lamps crashing against the wall of the conference\nroom, followed by defendant’s ranting and raving about Mr. Thompson. She also\nrecalled defendant saying that he “was going to destroy Mickey Thompson.” (When\npolice interviewed Ms. Sarantis, she said the word “destroy” was her characterization of\nwhat defendant said, and not a direct quote from defendant.)\n       e. Kathy Weese\n       Kathy Weese, who was then known as Kathy Johnson, worked for defendant for\nsix to eight months as a secretary in 1986. She often answered the telephone when\nMickey Thompson called. Defendant and Mr. Thompson “were always talking about the\nmoney situation.” On one occasion, Mr. Thompson phoned defendant, and Ms. Weese\noverheard defendant say, twice, “I’m going to take you out.” The two continued to\n\n                                              8\n\fargue, and Ms. Weese heard defendant say, “It would cost me $500 and a motor vehicle\nto have you taken out and I will take you out.” (Ms. Weese did not tell police about that\nstatement when she was interviewed in 1997, but the detective who interviewed her heard\nMs. Weese testify to the same effect at a preliminary hearing in Orange County in\n2002.)3\n       f. Barron Wehinger\n       Barron Wehinger, 16 years old in the fall of 1984, lived with his stepfather, Tom\nVillelli, in Durango, Colorado. Defendant visited the Durango residence, and discussed\nwith Mr. Villelli his “court battle” with Mr. Thompson. Mr. Wehinger heard defendant\ntell his stepfather, “I’ll kill him.” According to Mr. Wehinger, defendant said he was\ngoing to kill Mr. Thompson “[i]f he [defendant] lost his power to run the superbowl of\nmotorcross, his million-dollar-a-year income.” Mr. Wehinger heard defendant say, “I can\nget it done for 50 grand.” Mr. Villelli replied, “I could get it done for 20 grand,” and\ndefendant said, “I don’t want to get you involved, Tom.” Mr. Wehinger explained all this\nwas vivid in his memory because, around the same time, defendant had visited and\noffered to help Mr. Wehinger and his brother with their motocross careers, and “[w]hen\nsomebody offers you a chance to ride superbowl of motorcross, you listen to every word\nthey say, and when I heard that, I’ll never forget it.”\n       Mr. Wehinger did not mention anything about the $50,000 when he testified at the\npreliminary hearing in this case, and he never mentioned anything about a hit man to the\npolice or to the prosecutor. In his previous testimony, Mr. Wehinger said that the only\nthing he heard defendant say was “he [(defendant)] would have him [(Mr. Thompson)]\n\n\n\n\n3      Ms. Weese had a criminal history. She used aliases and had several theft-related\nconvictions. She had walked away from a Colorado halfway house (because she was\nbeaten and her daughter was attacked) to come to Los Angeles. Defendant had\nMs. Weese arrested, claiming she embezzled money. She was acquitted of that charge,\nbut spent eight months in custody awaiting trial and later was sent back to Colorado to\ncomplete her sentence there. She told police, “If I can help you get this guy, I’ll do\nanything,” and referred to defendant as a “son of a bitch.”\n\n                                              9\n\ftaken care of if he lost.” In 2003, Mr. Wehinger told police he heard defendant talking in\nlate 1987, or perhaps 60 or 90 days before the murders, rather than in 1984.\n        g. Penn Weldon\n        In November or December 1987, Penn Weldon, a private investigator, met\ndefendant to discuss possible investigative work for defendant. Defendant was “very\nupset and angry” during the hour-long meeting, and said he had been “fucked royally” by\nMickey Thompson; that he was so angry he had recently thrown a chair through the\nwindow of his house; and “that Mickey had ruined his life and he wanted to get even with\nhim.” Defendant wanted Mr. Weldon to investigate Mr. Thompson’s attorney, Philip\nBartinetti, and place listening devices in Mr. Bartinetti’s home and cars. Mr. Weldon\nrefused to do that, but agreed to and did perform other investigative actions relating to\nMr. Bartinetti.\n        h. Karen Dragutin\n        In the months preceding the murders, Karen Dragutin was at a Laguna Beach\nrestaurant with a man who knew defendant very well, and they were joined by defendant\nand his wife. Defendant’s jovial attitude changed when the conversation turned to\nlawyers and lawsuits and Mickey Thompson. Defendant became angry, said he “was\ngetting screwed by the lawyers”; “[t]he only way to get out of the mess was to take care\nof Mickey Thompson”; and “the only way he was going to get out of it is if Mickey\nThompson died.” Ms. Dragutin also testified defendant “was talking about a boat and\ngoing to Bermuda. And it was still in the context of that conversation. So my conclusion\nwas he was going away.” Defendant’s statement about the boat and going to Bermuda\n“was in the same part of the conversation as the taking care of this mess and Mickey had\nto die . . . .”\n        i. Gregory Keay\n        Gregory Keay was defendant’s cousin. At a family gathering two or three months\nbefore the murders, defendant said that “Mickey was out to get all of his money and\nbefore that would happen, he would have him wasted.” (When police interviewed\nMr. Keay in 1997, Mr. Keay did not use the term “wasted”; he told the detective that\n\n                                             10\n\fdefendant said, “That partner of mine is rubbing me the wrong way, he won’t be rubbing\nme much longer.”)\n       j. Dale Newman\n       In the fall of 1987, Dale Newman and a friend flew to Mexico to go diving, and\nmet defendant, who sent a 60-foot boat to the beach to pick them up. That evening, they\nwere on the bridge deck with defendant and his wife. Mr. Newman overheard defendant\nand his wife commiserating over a legal matter. Mr. Newman did not recall his exact\nwords, but defendant told his wife, in a threatening tone, in effect “that nothing bad was\ngoing to happen because he was going to take care of the party involved.”\n       k. John Williams\n       John Williams was a deputy marshal in Orange County from 1986 through 1988.\nHe was assigned to levy on defendant’s Mercedes automobile in connection with\nlitigation involving Mickey Thompson. He went to defendant’s residence and, in the\ncourse of the removal of the Mercedes, defendant said, “Mickey Thompson is fucking\ndead. He doesn’t know who he’s fucking with.” Both defendant and his wife used an\nextraordinary amount of “vicious language” about Mr. Thompson, and both repeated that\nMr. Thompson “was going to have something happen to him.” Mr. Williams reported the\nincident to his supervisor, and telephoned Mr. Thompson’s attorney to report the\nsuccessful levy and the threatening comments.\n       Mr. Williams testified that the incident occurred about three months before the\nThompson murders, but documentation showed a writ to levy was issued on June 4,\n1986; a levy worksheet was dated June 11, 1986; and a receipt for the towing service\nused for the defendant’s car was dated August 14, 1986. Mr. Williams, when shown\nthese documents, continued to insist the incident did not occur in August 1986. (After\nthe bankruptcies were filed in September and November 1986, Mr. Thompson would\nhave been unable to levy on the Mercedes, and in January 1988, defendant surrendered\nhis Mercedes to a representative of the bankruptcy trustee without incident.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f       l. Nancy Lucia\n       Nancy Lucia (formerly Wilkinson) worked for the Thompsons on weekends for\nseveral years and was a personal friend of Trudy Thompson’s. Ms. Lucia came to the\nThompsons’ home in the fall of 1987 to show Trudy Thompson her wedding\nphotographs. While they were in an upstairs room looking at the photographs, Mickey\nThompson came upstairs, out of breath and frantic. He was “almost kind of yelling,\nsaying ‘[c]lose the window. Close the drapes. [Defendant] could have a sniper out there\nright now.” The drapes were open at the time.\n       m. Joel Weissler\n       Joel Weissler was the Thompsons’ nephew. He met defendant in 1984 or 1985, at\na race promoted by his uncle, where the Thompsons introduced defendant as their “new\npartner.” Mr. Weissler talked with defendant for about five minutes, and remained in his\ncompany for the four-hour racing event. Mr. Weissler also spoke briefly to defendant at\na later event.\n       In late 1987 or early 1988, Mr. Weissler overheard defendant on the telephone.\nMr. Weissler was talking on the telephone with Trudy Thompson, and could hear Mickey\nThompson in the background, speaking with defendant on another phone line.\nMr. Weissler heard defendant say, in a loud, threatening tone, “You will never see a cent\nof it. I’m going to hurt you and your family.” Mr. Thompson responded, “Leave my\nfamily out of it.”\n       About a month later, Mr. Weissler was visiting the Thompsons’ home. He saw\nMickey Thompson and heard defendant’s voice on the speakerphone, saying: “You and\nyour family won’t see a penny of this. I’ll get you. I’m going to hurt you,” and “I’m\ngoing to hurt your family.” Mr. Thompson was very agitated and repeatedly said, “You\nstay away from me. You stay away from my family.”\n       At the time of the Thompsons’ funeral, Mr. Weissler told a detective he had heard\ndefendant make threats, but he was not asked for any details about the threats. In August\n1991, he and an uncle went to a police station in Los Angeles and met with the police to\nfind out what was going on with the investigation, as they were “impatient for something\n\n                                           12\n\fto happen.” When Mr. Weissler was asked whether he mentioned the phone\nconversations he had heard to the police at the August 1991 meeting, he said he did not\nrecall and he thought what he had to say was very redundant.\n       n. Lance Johnson\n       Lance Johnson was a friend and neighbor of the Thompsons. Years after the\nmurders, he was at the Santa Ana federal courthouse with Mickey Thompson’s sister,\nCollene Campbell. Defendant walked by, and Mr. Johnson heard him whisper to\nMs. Campbell, “You’re going to get yours, bitch.”4\n3. The Setting for the Murders and Other Pre-murder Facts\n       The Thompsons lived on Woodlyn Lane in a hilly neighborhood in “horse\ncountry,” with an irregular network of streets and private lanes or roads where “people\nget lost all the time.” Several driveways led out of the Thompson property, one of them\nto Woodlyn Lane, which was electronically gated. There was a locked gate between\nWoodlyn Lane and Royal Oaks, and a bike path below Royal Oaks. The home was also\naccessible via Mt. Olive Drive.\n       Ronald and Tonyia Stevens lived on Mt. Olive Drive. Several days before the\nmurders, near midday, as Mr. Stevens drove past the horse corral next to his home, he\nnoticed a car parked on the wrong side of the street. The person in the driver’s seat was\nlooking through binoculars in the direction of the nearby grammar school. Mr. Stevens\npulled into his driveway at the far end of the corral. His wife and daughter were there,\nand they told him the people in the car had been there for five or ten minutes.\nMr. Stevens asked his wife to call the police and walked through the corral to investigate.\nHe approached from behind the car, a blue-green, rusted and dirty 1970’s Chevy station\nwagon with Arizona plates.\n\n\n\n4       At defendant’s trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. Johnson if he recalled telling the\npolice that the words he heard defendant say were, “I’m going to get you, too.”\nMr. Johnson said it was “a very threatening remark to Collene Campbell,” but he did not\nrecall stating those words to the police.\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       From a distance of eight feet, Mr. Stevens saw two men in the car. The one in the\ndriver’s seat, a large man with “light-ish reddish hair,” wearing a cap on the back portion\nof his head, was holding binoculars. Mr. Stevens looked at the driver’s face for about a\nminute, mostly from his left profile; he “wanted to see who it was,” because “the person\ndidn’t belong there looking towards the school.” As Mr. Stevens approached, the driver\nturned around and looked directly at him, and then drove away. Mr. Stevens made a\nmental note of the driver’s face and tried to remember it. He also wrote down the license\nplate of the car on a business card. (Mr. Stevens told police that he was only able to view\nthe driver from the side; at trial he was asked if he remembered telling the detective that\nhe had only gotten within 15 or 20 feet of the driver, but he did not recall saying that. He\nalso did not remember telling the detective he was not sure which man had the\nbinoculars.)\n       Tonyia Stevens also saw the men in the car, “an old clunker station wagon with\nArizona plates,” two or three days before the murder, between noon and 3:00 p.m. She\nwas driving her daughter home from school, and turned left into her driveway. As she\npassed the car, she looked directly at the men and got a face-on view of the driver, who\nwas just putting down binoculars. She and her daughter went into the house and talked\nabout whether to call the police, because that type of car was out of place in the area, and\nshe was concerned about child abduction. Then her husband arrived, told Ms. Stevens to\ncall the police, and went back outside. Ms. Stevens followed him through the corral\ntoward the car. She came within 10 or 15 feet of the car, and saw the driver’s face when\nhe looked in her direction. After the driver sped away, Ms. Stevens called the sheriff’s\ndepartment from a telephone in the garage to report the suspicious-looking car; she\nwanted the police to know “in case anything happens that we have information.”\n       Mr. Stevens said that, even with binoculars, the Thompson residence and Woodlyn\nLane would not have been visible from the car’s location.\n       Kathy Weese later testified that while she was working for defendant’s company,\non one occasion she saw a station wagon in the parking lot, an older station wagon with\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fout-of-state plates, that had never been in the parking lot before and that she never saw\nagain.\n4. The Murders\n         The prosecution sought to show that Mickey Thompson was executed after\nwatching in horror as the same gunman first put a bullet through his wife’s head, and that\nthis was exactly how defendant wanted it to happen. The evidence was as follows.\n         a. Allison Triarsi – the witness to the murders\n         Fourteen-year-old Allison Triarsi witnessed the murders. The Thompson home\nwas across the street from and down the hill below the Triarsi residence. At 6:00 a.m. on\nthe day of the murders, Miss Triarsi was taking a shower and heard “horrible shrieks and\na lot of screaming” from a high-pitched voice. She also heard multiple gunshots. Her\nmother came in, grabbed her, and pushed her to the floor of the dining room. It had floor\nto ceiling windows, so she could see everything that happened in front of the Thompson\nhome.\n         Miss Triarsi saw Mickey Thompson toward the top of the Thompson driveway, by\nthe garage door. The Thompson minivan was in the driveway with the doors open.\nTrudy Thompson was towards the bottom of the downward sloping driveway. There was\na man with Mr. Thompson who “had a gun and was directing him and making him go in\ncertain directions.” Miss Triarsi heard Mr. Thompson say, over and over, “Please don’t\nkill my wife,” a statement that was directed to another man “at the bottom of the\ndriveway who had a gun and coming towards Trudy.” Mr. Thompson “was extremely\nagitated in his actions. He was moving in an agitated way. He was pleading for Trudy’s\nlife. He was very upset. The man was holding the gun directing the gun at him.”\nMr. Thompson was limping and “holding his body in different locations at different\ntimes,” “trying to stand, but he was struggling to do that.” It appeared Mr. Thompson\nwas trying to go to his wife, and the gunman was “hold[ing] him at bay with an\noutstretched hand with the gun in his hand.”\n         While Mickey Thompson was pleading with the gunman, Trudy Thompson was\non her knees at the bottom of the driveway with her hands “up and out to try to protect\n\n                                            15\n\fherself.” She said, “Please, please don’t kill me.” The gunman closest to Trudy\nThompson walked up close to her and was standing over her. Up to this point,\nMiss Triarsi had not seen anyone shoot a gun. The gunman near Trudy then shot her in\nthe head. She fell to the ground and did not move. Miss Triarsi did not remember what\nthe gunman who shot Trudy did next, “because the next thing I remember Mickey is\ngetting shot.”\n       Miss Triarsi saw Mr. Thompson trying to move toward his wife, “extremely upset;\nscreaming; crying,” and “[h]e ended up getting shot several times next.” “He was shot in\nthe direction of his torso/chest. I remember him grabbing his leg.” Miss Triarsi ran\noutside down the driveway, because she thought Trudy might still be alive. Miss Triarsi\nran to her, but Trudy Thompson never moved and had blood all over her head. Miss\nTriarsi wanted to go to Mickey Thompson, but then she “started to hear more gunshots.”\nShe was “very scared,” and hopped over a stone wall, ducked and waited there. Her\nmother realized where she had gone and was halfway down the driveway, running\ntowards her, when the gunshots rang out. When the police arrived, “we were still\nhiding.” Miss Triarsi never went up to the top of the driveway where Mr. Thompson was\nlying. She did not see either of the gunmen escaping, but she heard a clicking noise, like\na 10-speed bike with thin wheels. The sound came from the direction of the back way\nout of the Thompson property, and grew fainter and fainter.\n       b. Lance Johnson – the witness to the escape\n       A neighbor of the Thompsons, Lance Johnson, was wakened by five or\nsix gunshots. He ran to the window, and after 15 to 20 seconds of silence, he heard\nMickey Thompson loudly screaming, several times, “Please do not hurt my wife.” Then,\nhe heard another series of gunshots, followed by silence. He got out his gun, went to one\nof his front windows, and saw two African-American males riding bicycles (English\nracer bikes) down one of several driveways leading out of the Thompson property, this\none leading to the Thompsons’ barn and Woodlyn Lane. As they started down Woodlyn\nLane in front of his home, he yelled for them to stop, but they did not look in his\ndirection. He then fired a shot at them, but they just pedaled faster. One of them had a\n\n                                             16\n\fsmall bag (about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide) that “went up to a drawstring, . . .\nmore or less pear-shaped,” slung over his shoulder.\n       c. Other witnesses to the escape\n       Wilma Johnson was driving eastbound along Royal Oaks Drive North, at about\n6:00 a.m., and saw two men with bicycles run in front of her van near the intersection\nwith Woodlyn Lane, causing her to brake suddenly. She saw one of them very clearly, a\n“tallish” black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt. They were on foot, pushing 10-speed\nbikes that looked new and shiny, and running diagonally across the street. They\ndisappeared through a break in the fence toward the bicycle path that ran parallel to\nRoyal Oaks on the other side of the fence.\n       Claudette Freidinger was driving through Bradbury, “around 6:00-ish” in the\nmorning, on her way home from taking her son to work. She stopped at an intersection\non Royal Oaks. She saw two black men on good bicycles headed toward her, one with a\nhood and one without, “really, really barreling through the intersection” without stopping\nat the four-way stop. One of them looked in her direction. They were headed\nsouthbound, toward the freeway. (When police interviewed her, Ms. Freidinger said her\nson began work at 7:00 a.m., and expressed doubt about the involvement of the person\nshe saw based on the timing.)\n       d. The escape route\n       The escape route down the back side of the Thompson property to Woodlyn Lane\nwas “a very narrow declining paved road” that “curved and kind of wound” downhill,\nleading to an electronically controlled gate at Woodlyn Lane, and then to Royal Oaks.\nA bicycle would be the perfect vehicle for that road, because “two cars passing each other\nwould have great difficulty.” The gate was electronic, but could be easily opened\nmanually by applying pressure to one of the supporting arms. From there, at Woodlyn\nand Royal Oaks, a bicyclist would be able to pass through a break in the wooden fence\nbordering Royal Oaks, to the running and bike path below. The bike path intersected\nMt. Olive, a few blocks from access to the freeway.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       e. The murder scene and initial investigation\n       When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Trudy Thompson’s body at\nthe base of the steep, downward sloping driveway, and Mickey Thompson’s body toward\nthe top of the driveway, close to the garage door. Both had fatal gunshot wounds to the\nhead, as well as gunshot wounds to their bodies. Trudy Thompson would have been\nvisible to and within speaking distance of Mickey Thompson. A van appeared to have\nreversed into a retaining wall; its door was open, shattered glass from the driver’s door\nwas on the ground, and there was a bullet hole in the windshield.\n       When criminalist Elizabeth Devine arrived a few hours later, she saw money and\njewelry in plain view on the van’s seat. She found shoe prints in several locations, some\nof them from an area where miniature orange trees were planted; she also found freshly\ncut orange peels in the same area. Deputy Sheriff Linda Arthur photographed a stun gun\nthat was in the driveway.5\n       There was a wallet in Mickey Thompson’s pocket with hundreds of dollars in\ncash. Trudy Thompson was wearing high-value gold and diamond jewelry, and there\nwas $3,700 in cash inside her purse in the van. There was no indication of any attempt to\nremove property from either of the Thompsons, no sign of forced entry to the house, and\nthe house alarm was armed and had not been set off. The garage door was closed. There\nwas a safe inside the garage, but no indication it had been tampered with.\n       Detective Reynold Verdugo found expended bullet projectiles and casings at\nvarious locations at the scene, as well as two live rounds. Criminalist Manuel Munoz\ndetermined that all of the expended cartridge casings from the scene were 9-millimeter\nLuger caliber, and two firearms were used. Four expended casings and two live rounds\nwere from the same weapon; the other four expended casings were from a second\nweapon. Two expended bullets removed from Trudy Thompson’s body, one removed\nfrom the van’s passenger door, and one found under Mickey Thompson’s head, were\n\n5     Kathy Weese later testified that she saw a stun gun in a box in a storage area of\ndefendant’s Laguna Beach residence while she was house-sitting there in 1986.\n\n\n                                            18\n\ffired from the same weapon. The others, found inside the garage, near the garage, to the\nleft of Mickey Thompson’s body and inside the van on the driver’s side, were from the\nsecond weapon.\n        Mickey Thompson suffered seven gunshot wounds, three to his stomach, one to\nhis hip, two to the back of his hand, and one to his head, behind his right ear. Trudy\nThompson suffered two gunshot wounds, one to her lower stomach, likely inflicted first,\nwhich could have occurred while she was sitting in the van, and one to the back of her\nhead.\n5. Defendant’s Actions Before and After the Murders: the Yacht and the Gold\n        In December 1987, Diane Goodwin, defendant’s wife, indicated to a bank\nrepresentative that she was in the process of deciding on the purchase of a yacht. In\nJanuary 1988, Ms. Goodwin entered into a purchase agreement with Fraser Yachts for a\n$400,000 yacht, and wrote a check serving as an earnest money deposit for the purchase.\nA boat loan for Ms. Goodwin was approved on March 9, 1988. A seller’s closing\nstatement for the yacht was dated April 28, 1988, and a certificate of ownership dated\nMay 3, 1988, showed Ms. Goodwin as the owner of the yacht, named “Believe,” with a\nmortgage of $200,000 encumbering the yacht.\n        In May 1988, a coin dealer engaged in two transactions he said were with\ndefendant. He believed his initial contact with defendant was by telephone. He sold, in\nthe two transactions, almost $350,000 in gold coins, paid for by cashier’s checks signed\nby defendant’s wife.\n        On June 27, 1988, defendant brought the 57-foot yacht named Believe to a marina\nin South Carolina, managed by Victor Utsey, for installation of bilge pumps and radio\nequipment. The yacht was in the marina for about six weeks. After that outfitting, the\nyacht would have been capable of sailing offshore, such as to the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, or to the Bahamas and South America. The yacht was large enough for\ntransatlantic sail or anywhere in the world, if defendant had the capacity to produce\npotable water, and it was small enough to sail into small waterways and inlets.\nTwo people could live on the boat for an extended period of time. On the second or third\n\n                                            19\n\fday of August, defendant unexpectedly asked Mr. Utsey to expedite the work. Mr. Utsey\ndid so, and defendant sailed away from the marina.\n       In May 1991, a boat surveyor named Frank Magee was retained by Maryland\nNational Bank to repossess defendant’s yacht. He spent three to four weeks in\nGuatemala searching for it. During that time, he had a phone conversation with\ndefendant, who told him “he would never find his boat.” Mr. Magee located the yacht\nand defendant on the Dulce River in Guatemala, and repossessed the yacht for the bank.\n6. The Investigation and Arrest\n       Detective Michael Griggs of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department was\ninitially in charge of the murder investigation. He retired in January 1992. (One of\ndefendant’s claims is that Detective Griggs’s investigation was “derailed” by interference\nfrom Mickey Thompson’s sister.) Sergeant John Yarborough of the “unsolved” unit led\nthe investigation after Detective Griggs retired, and in 1995, Detective Mark Lillienfeld\nwas assigned to take over the investigation.\n       In 1997, Detective Lillienfeld participated in the production of an “America’s\nMost Wanted” show, hoping to identify the two actual perpetrators of the murders. (The\ndetective was also aware that an “Unsolved Mysteries” episode about the murders had\naired in 1988 and several times since then.) At various times in his investigation of\ndefendant, Detective Lillienfeld sought assistance from the DEA, the FBI, Customs, and\nother law enforcement agencies; sought and received authorization for a wiretap of\ndefendant’s telephones; and put defendant under physical surveillance.\n       In 1998, Detective Lillienfeld attended a meeting with the sheriff and the then-\ndistrict attorney, Gil Garcetti. Mr. Garcetti rejected the case against defendant as having\ninsufficient evidence for a successful prosecution. (Goodwin v. Superior Court (Apr. 23,\n2004, G031285) [nonpub. opn.].)\n       In 1999, defendant had a conversation with Randy Garell, the owner of a store\nspecializing in firearms and outdoor apparel and equipment. The two men knew each\nother from an earlier business relationship. Defendant came to Mr. Garell’s shop, and\nwanted to know how guns were traced; Mr. Garell told him. (Defendant told Mr. Garell\n\n                                               20\n\fhe was trying to investigate the Thompson case because he was a suspect, and defendant\n“may have” also said that the detective (presumably Detective Lillienfeld) “was saying\nsome things that were not true about weapons [defendant] may have owned.”) Then, in\nearly 2000, defendant came to the store again and asked if stun guns were traceable.\nMr. Garell said stun guns were not traceable, and did not fall under the same restrictions\nas guns.\n       Detective Lillienfeld also interviewed Gail Moreau-Hunter in March 1999.\nMs. Moreau-Hunter lived with defendant in Colorado in 1991 and 1992. Ms. Moreau-\nHunter told Detective Lillienfeld “she was privy to a conversation in which [defendant]\ntook responsibility for the murders,” but subsequently told the detective that defendant\n“never actually took credit for the crime but merely left that impression with her.”\n(Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285, at p. 9.) (Ms. Moreau-Hunter testified at\nthe preliminary hearing in Los Angeles – but not at trial – that sometime in 1992,\ndefendant showed her a tape of an “Unsolved Mysteries” episode reenacting the\nThompson murders and said, “Look what I’ve done and I got away with it,” and “I hired\ntwo black teenagers to carry out the assassinations.”)\n       In early 2001, Detective Lillienfeld interviewed Ronald and Tonyia Stevens for\nthe first time. They gave the detective the information about the man with binoculars\nparked in front of their house a few days before the murders, as described in part 3, ante.\n(Mr. Stevens had called the police several times, not long after the murders, saying he\nthought he had some information about the Thompson murders; he was told a detective\nwould call him back, but no one ever did.)\n       In March 2001, Mr. Stevens viewed a photographic lineup, or “six-pack.” He had\ndescribed the man with binoculars as “a big man with reddish colored hair and a ruddy\ncomplexion.” He later testified that he saw the person who had been in the car in front of\nhis house in the six-pack. He and his wife were asked to view a live lineup, separately,\nand both of them identified the defendant.\n       In December 2001, Detective Lillienfeld obtained a search warrant for defendant’s\nhome, seizing thousands of documents. Defendant was arrested and charged by the\n\n                                             21\n\fOrange County District Attorney with the 1988 murders and with conspiracy to commit\nmurder.\n       On April 23, 2004, the Court of Appeal issued a writ ordering the trial court to\ndismiss the case for lack of venue.6 The court “emphasize[d] that any new evidence, not\npreviously considered by the Los Angeles District Attorney prior to its rejection of the\ncase, can – and should be – given to the Los Angeles District Attorney for\nreconsideration of that decision, or to the Office of the Attorney General for its review\nand consideration.” (Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285, at p. 34.)\n       The Los Angeles District Attorney charged defendant with the murders, and after\na six-day preliminary hearing in October 2004, defendant was held to answer and\narraigned on October 28, 2004.\n7. The Trial\n       The trial court denied successive motions to dismiss the case, to recuse the Los\nAngeles District Attorney’s office, and to remove the two prosecutors handling the case –\nas delineated in detail post in connection with defendant’s contention these rulings were\nerroneous. Trial began in October 2006.\n       In addition to the facts already described, other evidence was adduced as follows.\n       a. Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony on financial records\n       Karen Stephens-Kingdon was a certified public accountant, an investigative\nauditor for the Orange County District Attorney’s office, and a certified fraud examiner\nand internal auditor. She had previously testified as an expert forensic accountant or\ninvestigative auditor. In early 1992, she was asked to look at the financial records of\ndefendant and his wife to determine “the source of assets and funds and the ultimate\n\n\n6      Defendant had previously sought a writ, after denial of his motion to recuse the\nOrange County District Attorney, alleging a conflict of interest due to that official’s\npersonal relationship with Mickey Thompson’s sister. The Court of Appeal denied that\npetition, allowing defendant “to pursue his assertion that Orange County lacked any\ndisinterested purpose in prosecution.” (Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285, at\npp. 2-3.)\n\n\n                                             22\n\fdisposition of those assets and funds.” She examined thousands of documents from\n1986, 1987 and 1988, and found evidence that funds that had been in defendant’s name\n“ended up in Diane Goodwin’s name.”\n       Ms. Stephens-Kingdon testified that while the yacht Diane Goodwin purchased\nwas in her name, it was “purchased with funds that had been commingled for so many\nyears that this boat purchase was for both Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin.” The Goodwins’\nresidence in Laguna Beach, which they purchased and lived in together, appeared to have\nbeen purchased with commingled assets, and was liquidated (converted into cash or other\nliquid assets) in 1988.\n       Ms. Stephens-Kingdon testified in particular about two investments – JGA\nWhitehawk and Desert Investors – that were in the name of Diane Goodwin in 1988.\nMs. Goodwin put what Ms. Stephens-Kingdon considered to be “commingled funds” of\nboth the Goodwins into those investments in her own name. Then, there was a\ndistribution from JGA Whitehawk to Diane Goodwin for $365,000 on May 6, 1988, and\na few days later, a portion of those funds was used to purchase $275,000 in gold coins,\nand $10,000 was wired offshore. Similarly, $215,000 was distributed from Desert\nInvestors to Diane Goodwin in May 1988; she transferred $140,000 to an account\noffshore and purchased $75,000 in gold coins.\n       In short, “funds that were originally commingled and invested end[ed] up going\noffshore or to purchase gold coins, cash or traveler’s checks.” Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s\nopinion was based on early tax returns, the home in both the Goodwins’ names that was\nliquidated in 1988, and financial and banking records “that were in both of their names\nand then the records show that it all funnels into Diane Goodwin’s name and then . . . the\nfunds go offshore.” She also based her opinion in part on correspondence purporting to\nbe from defendant. One of the letters stated defendant “was handling the entire [Desert\nInvestors] transaction and not to discuss it with Diane because he was handling it” (even\nthough the entirety of the Desert Investors account was in Diane Goodwin’s name);\nanother said certain items should be put in Diane Goodwin’s name because of the\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fThompson issue. (This testimony was admitted only to show the basis for Ms. Stephens-\nKingdon’s opinion.)\n       Ms. Stephens-Kingdon also reviewed bank statements showing that on or about\nMarch 16, 1988 (the date of the murders), there was a $20,000 withdrawal from Diane\nGoodwin’s account, likely as a cashier’s check or cash as there was no personal check.\nMs. Stephens-Kingdon was unable to trace that money; the bank “had no supporting\ndocuments for their record.”\n       b. Evidence of a robbery motive for the murders\n       The defense adduced evidence intended to suggest a robbery motive for the\nmurders. Eric Miller, a friend of Mickey Thompson’s, was with Mr. Thompson the night\nbefore the murders. Mr. Thompson was talking to Lee Haslam about investments.\nSheriff’s Detective Rene Laporte interviewed Mr. Miller about a month after the murders,\nand took notes of the interview. According to those notes (Detective Laporte had no\nindependent recollection of the interview), Mr. Miller told the deputy that “he heard\nMickey Thompson say he had taken possession of a valuable item and named . . . a\nspecific dollar amount.” Counsel asked if Mr. Miller “actually use[d] the words ‘taken\npossession,’ ” and Detective Laporte said, “Yes.” (On cross-examination, he testified his\nnotes were a paraphrasing of the conversation with Mr. Miller.) The notes became part\nof a report that was given to Detective Griggs, who was then managing the investigation.\nDetective Laporte did not, and was not directed to, look into Mr. Thompson’s financial\nrecords to see if he could match up the dollar amount specified with any sort of deposit or\noutgoing notation in those records.\n       Sandra Johnson (Lance Johnson’s wife) saw the two “very dark” men riding\nracing bikes down Woodlyn Lane, and told police that one of them “was carrying a white\ncanvas bag, shopping bag size.” At trial, Ms. Johnson described the bag as “[a] small like\ndrawstring bag,” “10, 12 inches,” “not a great big backpack, but something smaller.”\nRobert Wiborg, a coin dealer, testified that coins shipped via Brinks come in sealed\ncanvas bags, generally white, that look like a regular bank bag and usually have a metal\nseal on the top.\n\n                                            24\n\f       A few weeks after the murders, Detective Gerald Jansen met Mickey Thompson’s\nsister, Collene Campbell, and a locksmith at the Thompson home. Ms. Campbell had\nasked Detective Jansen to accompany her while she had a locksmith break into the safes\nin the Thompson home, so that the deputy could note what was in the safes. The\ndetective’s notes referred to damage to the safe in the garage; he wrote: “ ‘bolt bar bent.\nFresh marks on the locking wheel. Safe empty.’ ” His notes did not indicate whether the\nlocksmith created the damage or pointed it out to Detective Jansen, but he testified that\n“to the best of my recollection, it was after he had opened the safe, that’s the way the safe\nlooked.” He said that if the damage he noted had been there when he arrived, he would\nnot have had the safe opened, and “would have called somebody out to look at it.”\nDetective Jansen would make such notes “[s]o that if somebody says we damaged it more\nthan we actually did to open it, I could say how much we damaged it.” The safe in the\nbedroom closet contained jewelry and two envelopes of money.\n       c. The expert on eyewitness identifications\n       The defense presented testimony from an expert on eyewitness identification,\nDr. Kathy Pezdek. She described the factors that influence the accuracy of eyewitness\nidentifications. Dr. Pezdek opined that a 13-year delay between seeing an individual and\nidentifying him “alone would render such an identification extremely dubious,” and\nindeed that the probability of correctly identifying a person, seen one time very briefly,\nafter 11 months (much less 13 years) is zero. Dr. Pezdek also testified about suggestive\nlineup and identification procedures, as well as the relationship between the accuracy of\nan identification and the confidence of the witness in making it.\n       d. The defense’s firearms expert\n       The firearms expert for the defense, Jacobus Swanepoel, examined the ballistics\nevidence and visited the crime scene. He determined the expended casings came from\ntwo different firearms, but could not make that determination with respect to the fired\nbullets. Based on the placement of expended cartridge cases in relation to expended\nbullets, Mr. Swanepoel opined that both guns were fired at both victims, and Mickey\nThompson likely received his fatal head wound while he was lying down.\n\n                                             25\n\f       e. Investigation deficiencies and inconsistencies\n       The defense produced evidence purporting to show deficiencies in the\ninvestigation of the murders, as well as evidence of inconsistencies between the\ntestimony witnesses gave in court and their previous statements to police investigators.\n              i. Investigative deficiencies\n       Detective Griggs, the lead investigator until January 1992, obtained defendant’s\ntelephone records and set up a database, but did not do the same thing for Mickey\nThompson’s telephones (and neither did Detective Lillienfeld). Detective Griggs did no\nfinancial investigation into defendant or Mickey Thompson or any Thompson family\nmember or employee. Detective Lillienfeld did not attempt to get financial or telephone\nrecords of individuals employed in the Thompson home.\n       There were notes in the original investigation about Arizona license plates on a car\nrelated to a suspect other than defendant. Even after Ronald and Tonyia Stevens told him\nabout the Arizona license plate on the car in front of their house, Detective Lillienfeld did\nnot run the Arizona license plate noted in the investigative file through the computer\nsystem, to find out if that license plate number was associated with a station wagon.\n       Over the years, Detective Lillienfeld was privy to clues involving black men as\nsuspected shooters, but he never showed any photographs of African-American men to\nany witnesses in the case. A hair was removed from the stun gun found at the crime\nscene, but Detective Lillienfeld did not ask for DNA testing on it, nor did he submit the\nfingernail clippings and scrapings taken from the Thompsons for testing. (The defense\neventually tested these items.)\n              ii. Witness inconsistencies\n       In addition to inconsistencies already noted, there were others.\n       When Detective Lillienfeld first interviewed Allison Triarsi in 1997, she told him\nthat she thought the shooter could have been a white man; that she believed her\nrecollection was influenced by her mother; that it was possible Trudy Thompson was shot\nwhile she (Allison) was running down her driveway; and that she had talked to a school\npsychologist about the incident.\n\n                                              26\n\f       When Detective Lillienfeld first interviewed Tonyia Stevens in 2001, she said she\ncould not recall whether or not the car she saw parked in front of her home a few days\nbefore the murders was occupied. She did not tell him that the person she saw in the car\nreminded her of a childhood friend (as she did when she testified in court), and his report\nof her interview took up “maybe two paragraphs.”\n       Deputy Sheriff John Rodriguez, the first officer to arrive on the scene, interviewed\nLance Johnson (who saw the two black men leaving the scene) an hour or so after the\nmurders. Mr. Johnson told him he was awakened by gunshots and “about the same time”\nheard Mickey Thompson screaming to the effect of “ ‘[d]on’t hurt his wife,’ or ‘help,’\nscreaming for help.” Mr. Johnson told Deputy Rodriguez that the shooting stopped and\nthen a few moments later there were several more shots, after which he went outside and\nsaw the bicyclists escaping. Detective Laporte interviewed Mr. Johnson that day, and\nstated in his notes that Mr. Johnson “said he wasn’t sure whether he heard the gunshots\nfirst or the yelling first.”\n8. The Verdicts\n       The jury convicted defendant of both counts of first degree murder on January 7,\n2007, also finding the lying in wait and multiple murder allegations true. The trial court\nimposed consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole, and made other orders\nnot at issue on this appeal.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       We address the issues in the order presented in defendant’s opening brief.7\n\n\n7       After filing his opening brief, defendant requested judicial notice be taken of\n(1) the transcript of the preliminary hearing held in Orange County in 2002; (2) the\ndocket and unpublished decision in Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285; (3) the\ndocket in People v. Dimascio (case No. G005903) (a case in which Mickey Thompson\ntestified (see pt. 9, post)); and (4) the grand jury testimony of Detective Lillienfeld. We\ntake judicial notice of item (2), the docket and unpublished opinion in Goodwin v.\nSuperior Court, as the trial court expressly referred to it in denying defendant’s request\nfor dismissal based on the delay in prosecuting defendant. We otherwise deny\ndefendant’s request. As to item (3), there is no dispute over the fact that Mickey\nThompson testified in the case, so judicial notice accomplishes nothing. As for the grand\n\n                                            27\n\f1. The Dismissal and Recusal Claims\n       Defendant first contends the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the case, to\nrecuse the district attorney’s office, and to remove the individual prosecutors. These\ncontentions are grounded on the seizure, retention and review of hundreds of attorney-\nclient privileged documents. We find no error in the trial court’s rulings.\n       a. The factual and procedural background\n       On December 13, 2001, police executed a search warrant for defendant’s home in\nOrange County, seizing thousands of documents filling more than 120 bankers boxes.\nOn December 26, 2001, defendant’s then-attorney, Jeffrey Benice, wrote to the Orange\nCounty prosecutor telling him the boxes of documents and computers seized contained\nattorney-client privileged documents, and demanding appointment of a special master to\nprotect defendant’s privilege. The prosecutor declined, observing a special master was\nrequired only when a search warrant sought documents in the possession or control of an\n\n\njury and preliminary hearing transcripts, defendant contends they “are relevant to the\nissues of prosecutorial and police misconduct, . . . presentation of false evidence\nmanufactured by Detective Lillienfeld, and violation of [defendant’s] Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel and attorney-client privilege by both the [Orange County District\nAttorney] and the [Los Angeles District Attorney],” and “contain admissions by\nDetective Lillienfeld, testimony contradicting his trial testimony and testimony\ncontradicting the positions taken by the [Los Angeles District Attorney] at trial.” (See\npts. 1 & 16, post.) If indeed they are relevant, they should have been presented to the\ntrial court in the first instance, and they were not. Defendant’s contention that the trial\ncourt “examined and considered” the grand jury and preliminary hearing transcripts “and\nmade rulings, thus taking judicial notice of them” is not supported by the record. There is\nnothing in the record to show the trial court “examined” these transcripts; there are\nmerely occasional arguments by counsel or testimony referring to the preliminary\nhearing, or to testimony given at that hearing. “Reviewing courts generally do not take\njudicial notice of evidence not presented to the trial court. Rather, normally ‘when\nreviewing the correctness of a trial court’s judgment, an appellate court will consider only\nmatters which were part of the record at the time the judgment was entered.’ [Citation.]”\n(Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 444, fn. 3; People v.\nPreslie (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 486, 492 [“as a general rule the court should not take such\nnotice if, upon examination of the entire record, it appears that the matter has not been\npresented to and considered by the trial court in the first instance”].) That is the case\nhere.\n\n                                             28\n\fattorney. According to defendant, the documents were held by the Orange County\nprosecutors for several months, copied and then most of them were returned to defendant.\n       More than two years later, after the Court of Appeal found venue was improper in\nOrange County, the copies of the seized documents were forwarded to the Los Angeles\nDistrict Attorney’s office. Defendant’s former counsel did not inform his trial counsel of\nthe attorney-client privilege issue, and his trial counsel did not discover it until she\nreviewed the seized documents provided to her in discovery.\n       The documents seized (copies of which were later reviewed by a special master\nappointed by the trial court, as described post) included some 475 pages (by the\nprosecution’s count) that were ultimately found to be attorney-client privileged\ndocuments. The trial court agreed the material was privileged: “It is information\ncommunicated to and from [defendant’s] lawyers; it’s information [defendant] has\ncommunicated to his lawyers in letters back. It does involve his strategies and his\npotential defenses to the charges.”\n       Defendant made a series of motions seeking a remedy for the invasion of\ndefendant’s attorney-client privilege.\n              i. The first motion to dismiss\n       On December 9, 2004, defendant moved to dismiss the case, claiming intentional\nviolation of defendant’s attorney client privilege and citing the power of the court arising\nfrom the due process clause to dismiss a case for outrageous conduct. Defendant claimed\nthat “[f]ew, if any” of the thousands of documents seized were named in the search\nwarrant, and submitted a sampling under seal of 35 documents that were obviously\nprivileged.\n       The motion asserted the authorities were aware when they executed the search\nwarrant that many of the documents in defendant’s home office were privileged\ndocuments. (Defendant told Detective Lillienfeld so when the detective served him with\na grand jury subpoena in March 2001, and defendant posted signs on his office door.)\nThe motion also asserted that Detective Lillienfeld procured the services of Thurston\nMichael (Butch) Jones, who was working as an office assistant for defendant and later for\n\n                                              29\n\fattorney Benice, to provide daily updates “on activities relating to [defendant’s]\npreparation of his defense,” including “reporting on issues he had learned during\nattorney/client conferences.”\n       At the hearing on March 17, 2005, the court stated, as to the 35 samples submitted,\n“I can’t find any evidentiary value to those documents,” and noted that no evidence\npresented at the preliminary hearing came from those documents. The court posed the\npertinent question as whether the Los Angeles District Attorney had evidence that came\nfrom potentially privileged information. The prosecutor made no objection to a court\norder precluding the prosecutor from presenting any evidence derived from potentially\nprivileged communications.\n       Defendant orally requested recusal of the prosecutor as an alternative to dismissal,\narguing that the first time the Los Angeles prosecutors saw an obviously privileged\ndocument, they were obliged to “close the book and to give it to the court, all\n40,000 pages,” and seek appointment of a special master. The court rejected this notion,\nobserving that “the Orange County D.A.’s office probably should have [done something]\nand they didn’t,” but the Los Angeles prosecutor was not made aware of the objections\nthat had been made in Orange County after the seizure, and had no obligation “three or\nfour years after the fact to then bring to the court’s attention the fact that there might be\nsome privileged material.”\n       The court thus denied the motion to dismiss and the recusal request. But, since\nthere were hundreds of other privileged documents, the court ruled the defense could\npresent those to the court under seal, for review by the court or a special master. This\nwould ultimately provide the court with a means of enforcing its tentative remedy: that\nno evidence derived from potentially privileged documents could be used. The court also\nconcluded a hearing would be necessary on the claim that Detective Lillienfeld had\ninterfered with attorney-client privilege by using Butch Jones to report on information\nobtained in attorney-client conferences.\n\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\f              ii. The second set of motions\n       On April 7, 2005, defendant filed motions under seal, including a motion to\ndismiss for egregious governmental misconduct; a motion to recuse the district attorney’s\noffice based on due process, “the inherent conflict of interest created by the review of”\nattorney-client privileged documents, and violation of defendant’s Fourth, Fourteenth,\nFifth and Sixth Amendment rights; and a motion for the return of illegally seized\ndocuments under Penal Code section 1538.5. The court held numerous hearings, with the\nfollowing results.\n       On April 27 and May 16, 2005, the court took testimony from Detective\nLillienfeld, Michael (Butch) Jones, and Attorney Jeffrey Benice with respect to\ndefendant’s claim that the case should be dismissed because Detective Lillienfeld used\nMr. Jones to obtain attorney-client privileged information. The trial court denied that\nbasis for defendant’s motion to dismiss, finding based on the testimony “no intentional\ninterference with the attorney/client privilege . . . .” Mr. Jones “did some running for\nMr. Benice; he did some copying for Mr. Benice and [defendant]. He may have looked\nat some files and obtained some information.” But the court declined to categorize the\nrelationship “as one that is covered by the attorney/client relationship,” and saw no\n“intentional act on the part of law enforcement to interfere with the attorney/client\nprivilege or to obtain privileged material.” “I agree that perhaps there was a question that\ncould have been asked or should have been asked. But that in no way causes me concern\nsuch that I should find the sanction an appropriate remedy, particularly a dismissal.”\n       On May 26, 2005, the Attorney General filed its opposition to defendant’s motion\nto recuse the district attorney’s office, including a declaration from prosecutor Alan\nJackson. Mr. Jackson stated he was the only current employee of the district attorney’s\noffice who had reviewed the material obtained through the search warrant. He stated\nthat, to the extent any document he reviewed was protected by attorney-client privilege,\nhe had not disclosed it to anyone else, nor would he do so in the future. He further stated\nno decisions were made, influenced, affected or impacted by the office’s possession of\nany privileged document; the office had not and would not use any privileged\n\n                                             31\n\finformation; all evidence introduced at trial would be derived from independent sources;\nall pretrial and trial strategy had been and would be based on independent sources; “and\nnothing obtained has had or will have any effect whatsoever on the decisions about the\nscope and nature of the investigation and prosecution, about what witnesses to call (and\nin what order), about what questions to ask (and in what order), about what lines of\ndefense to anticipate in presenting the case-in-chief, and about what to save for possible\nrebuttal.”\n       On June 2, 2005, the court denied defendant’s motion for recusal of the district\nattorney’s office and prosecutors Alan Jackson and Pat Dixon. (The recusal motion was\nbased on the district attorney having seen both privileged documents and documents\nasserted to be beyond the scope of the search warrant.) The court denied the motion\nwithout prejudice, finding no showing of a conflict that would deprive defendant of a fair\ntrial. “The only thing I can say is that the People are in possession of privileged material,\nthat they have agreed . . . not to use . . . in any way and not to use any evidence obtained\nas a result of that material in the trial.” The court said that “if circumstances change, or if\nother facts are developed . . . I’m sure [the defense will] renew that motion and possibly\neven [the] motion to dismiss, but at this point I’m going to deny the [Penal Code section\n1424 (section 1424)] recusal motion.” (Under section 1424, a motion to disqualify a\ndistrict attorney “may not be granted unless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest\nexists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial.”) The\ncourt also observed, as to the section 1538.5 motion for return of property, that the\ndefense had shown there were some materials that were “technically outside the scope of\nthe warrant,” shifting the burden to the prosecution. The court decided to appoint a\nspecial master to determine which documents were privileged and which were beyond the\nscope of the warrant.\n       On January 25, 2006, the defense again moved, under seal, to dismiss the charges\nbased on egregious governmental misconduct, or in the alternative to recuse the entire\ndistrict attorney’s office, or to remove the individual prosecutors. The defense provided a\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\fdetailed analysis of the privileged materials and why the case should be dismissed based\non the prosecutor’s access to the privileged documents.\n       On February 6, 2006, the trial court again refused to recuse the entire district\nattorney’s office, finding “that it wasn’t this D.A.’s office that committed this egregious\nmisconduct,” and the defense had not presented enough “to show that the entire D.A.’s\noffice needs to be recused in this matter . . . .” The court observed it had reviewed the\nprivileged material the special master had segregated. The court reiterated that “I don’t\nbelieve under any scenario we are going to get to a recusal of the entire D.A.’s office,”\nbut that a hearing should be held on the possible recusal of the two prosecutors. (The\nprosecutor had had no access to the sealed pleadings, and no opportunity to respond to\nthe defense claim that the prosecution’s theory of the case was altered in light of the\nprivileged information.) The court also reiterated its finding that “I don’t think that we\nhave egregious misconduct on the part of this prosecutorial agency such that the court\nwould have to dismiss the case as a sanction,” and indicated that “in a perfect world,\nperhaps [prosecutor Jackson] should step aside.”\n       At a hearing on February 15, 2006, on the recusal issue, prosecutor Jackson\nreported that his office declined the court’s suggestion he step aside. The court found no\ndisabling conflict of interest under section 1424, but believed it had “the inherent\nauthority to disqualify a prosecutor who has been tainted by attorney/client privilege\nmaterial.” The court decided prosecutor Jackson should review the privileged documents\ncited and analyzed in the defendant’s recusal request, so that he would have the\nopportunity to demonstrate that the privileged material had already been disclosed to\nothers such that the court could find a waiver of the privilege.\n       The prosecutor then filed, for a hearing on March 6, 2006, a detailed analysis of\nthe documents the special master concluded were privileged, arguing that “defendant has\nnot, and cannot, establish that he has suffered any prejudice as a result of [Deputy District\nAttorney] Alan Jackson’s review of the claimed privileged documents.” The prosecutor\ndescribed the documents and categorized them as either (1) documents with no facial\nindication that they were protected communications; (2) nonprejudicial as not pertaining\n\n                                             33\n\fto the Thompson murders; or (3) documents to which waiver applied because the subject\nmatter had been published in alternate, unprivileged sources. The prosecutor attached\nvarious publications, including a transcribed interview from “America’s Most Wanted,”\nas well as defendant’s memorandum to the producers of that television show, and\nconcluded defendant “has systematically published in almost every media forum\navailable his thoughts, theories, defenses, excuses, accusations, analyses and beliefs\nsurrounding the Thompson murders.”\n       At the March 6 hearing, the court expressed doubt that it had inherent authority to\nrecuse the district attorney (as opposed to authority under section 1424), and ruled:\n“[G]iven what the People have presented to the court by way of, No. 1, that there was a\nwaiver; No. 2, the issue of the documents being irrelevant and third argument that there\nwas no prejudice, . . . I think the People’s response addresses the court’s concerns and I\ndon’t know at this point that I’m prepared to go any further assuming I have inherent\nauthority to recuse the DA to enforce the order that I made earlier. I am not prepared to\ngo that way.” And, “even assuming I do [have inherent authority], . . . there has been no\nsubstantial showing of prejudice which would warrant the court taking that next step\n[removing prosecutor Jackson]. I think the remedy that I imposed earlier in these\nproceedings is adequate.” And, “I think I can guarantee that the attorney-client\nprivileged material is not used.” “I am basically saying that based on what I have now,\nall of the available information to me including now all of the information that I have\nseen that is in the public domain — let me put it that way. Not that it is not privileged,\nbut it is information in the public domain and so based upon all of the available\ninformation that I have as of this moment, I am not prepared to take a step that I think is a\ndrastic step that does implicate separation of powers arguments and is a remedy that I\nwould have been prepared to utilize in the appropriate case. This is not the appropriate\ncase given all of the available information I have before me and so that is where I am at.”\n              iii. The motion to exclude witnesses’ testimony\n       In May 2006, defendant filed a motion to exclude the trial testimony of\n12 witnesses, including Phillip Bartinetti, Dolores Cordell, Jeffrey Coyne, and Karen\n\n                                             34\n\fStephens-Kingdon – and in the alternative, again renewed its recusal and removal\nmotions. The named witnesses were the “financial witnesses,” and defendant argued that\n“by calling the financial witnesses, the prosecutors would be changing theories of the\ncase based upon the content of [defendant’s] privileged documents [(the ones that\npertained to the ‘federal fraud litigation’)].” (In 1993, defendant was charged in federal\ncourt with bankruptcy and loan fraud, and was ultimately convicted of making false\nstatements to a financial institution. According to defendant, some of the named\nwitnesses “were part of the driving force behind [defendant’s] prosecution for federal\ncrimes relating to his bankruptcy,” and they “will be the prosecutor’s main witnesses to\ntry to establish ‘motive’ for these murders.”) “The blueprint of his defense to the\nfinancial allegations has been exposed. His thought processes and conduct relating to his\nhandling of the civil judgment and bankruptcy have been exposed. His right to testify on\nhis own behalf has been compromised as he is now going to have to face a prosecutor\nwho is armed with information that he received outside the bounds of the rules governing\nfair trials.”\n        The prosecutor challenged the defense to point to “anything that establishes that\nthe defendant has suffered a prejudice so bad that he cannot receive a fair trial if I call\nany of those witnesses who deal with his financial status.”\n        The court heard and denied defendant’s motion on June 20, 2006. The court\npointed out its earlier order on the prosecutor’s obligation not to use any privileged\nmaterial or any material derived from it. “So I assume that that order has been taken\nseriously by the People. I assume that the People are calling witnesses that they were\nplanning on calling all along. And that they did not obtain any new information from\ntheir accidental review of the privileged material. So correct me if I’m wrong on that.”\n        The court concluded: “I think that the People’s position has actually a great deal\nof merit based on what I have reviewed and what I ruled on in the previous litigation in\nterms of whether or not they are able to comply with my order. I think they are. And the\nremedy was that they were not permitted to use evidence obtained from the privileged\nmaterial. And they say they are not. [¶] And I guess until we get to a point during trial\n\n                                              35\n\fwhere the defense wants to renew their motion based on testimony, I don’t know what\nelse I can do pretrial in that regard. I mean it’s an unfortunate situation I think we all\nagree. But we really kind of resolved this issue before. And I don’t think there is any\nneed for any additional sanction. Because that’s what is being requested here is that the\ncourt exclude testimony. [¶] The court will not exclude testimony that’s otherwise\nrelevant at this trial. And it does appear that the financial motive is the motive in this\ncase. And the court doesn’t believe that there has been a sufficient showing to warrant\nthe recusal of these prosecutors from this case. But, again, the court has the ability to\nmonitor and enforce the court’s previous order. And that will be done.”\n       b. The law\n       We begin our discussion of the legal basis for rejecting defendant’s dismissal and\nrecusal claims with a few prefatory comments. We share the trial court’s recognition that\ncertain of the conduct that occurred in Orange County in connection with defendant’s\nattorney-client privileged documents appeared to have been, in the trial court’s words,\n“egregious misconduct.” We do not condone or countenance those actions. But\nestablished principles of law govern our review of claims that a criminal proceeding\nshould be dismissed or prosecutors recused on that account.\n       As our narration of the proceedings in the trial court shows, the court took great\ncare in its assessment of the circumstances surrounding the seizure, retention and review\nof the privileged documents, entertaining renewed motions, engaging a special master,\nand holding multiple hearings as the defense developed its evidence and theories. The\ntrial court gave meticulous attention to the evidence and arguments presented. In so\ndoing, it plainly appreciated the gravity of the underlying invasion of defendant’s\nattorney-client privilege, and showed skepticism about claims of prosecutorial ignorance\nof privileged matters. We have done so as well in our independent review of the record.\nBut in the end, we cannot gainsay the trial court’s conclusions that “it wasn’t this D.A.’s\noffice that committed this egregious misconduct,” and that the necessary showing of\nprejudice to defendant’s right to a fair trial was absent.\n       We turn to our discussion of defendant’s several different but related claims.\n\n                                              36\n\f              i. Dismissal for outrageous governmental misconduct\n       Defendant contends the case should have been dismissed based on outrageous\ngovernmental misconduct that violated his due process rights. He asserts the district\nattorney was accountable for “the outrageous misconduct of the investigators and the\nprosecutors, both in Orange County and in Los Angeles,” and the trial court erred in\nconsidering only the Los Angeles prosecutor’s conduct. Specifically, defendant asserts\nthe district attorney was responsible for the conduct of Detective Lillienfeld of the Los\nAngeles Sheriff’s Department, who headed the search team that seized the documents in\nOrange County and who “could not have missed the sign on [defendant’s] home office\ndoor asserting attorney-client privilege and directing police to his attorney . . . .”\nDefendant argues that, just as the prosecutor is responsible for any nondisclosure of\nfavorable evidence under Brady v. Maryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83 (Brady), including\nevidence known to anyone acting on the government’s behalf, the prosecutor here is\npresumed to be responsible for the violation of defendant’s attorney-client privilege,\nwhether committed by government agents from Orange County or Los Angeles. And,\ndefendant says, dismissal is required whether or not he can demonstrate prejudice.\n       Defendant is mistaken on all counts.\n       First, we note the standard of review. “The determination of whether the\ngovernment engaged in outrageous conduct in violation of defendant’s due process rights\nis a mixed question.” (People v. Uribe (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 836, 857 (Uribe).) A\ndeferential standard of review applies to the factual determination of whether and to what\nextent misconduct occurred. (Id. at pp. 857-858.) Whether the governmental conduct\n“constitutes outrageous conduct in the constitutional sense of violating defendant’s due\nprocess rights” is primarily a legal question. (Id. at p. 858 [“the trial court’s finding that\nthe governmental conduct was outrageous in violation of defendant’s due process rights\nthereby warranting dismissal is subject to independent review”].)\n       Second, where a defendant seeks dismissal for outrageous governmental acts,\n“a showing of prejudice to defendant’s right to a fair trial [is] required and . . . the\nabsence of such a showing preclude[s] dismissal as a sanction for prosecutorial\n\n                                               37\n\fmisconduct.” (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 861; id. at p. 865 [prosecutor’s\nmisconduct “was certainly conscience-shocking in the sense that it involved false\ntestimony by a prosecutor in a formal criminal proceeding,” but “it did not involve ‘brutal\nand . . . offensive’ conduct employed to obtain a conviction”; the defendant “was not\nentitled to dismissal for outrageous governmental conduct shocking the conscience in\nviolation of substantive due process”]; see also United States v. Morrison (1981)\n449 U.S. 361, 367, 362, 365-366 (Morrison) [the high court, while “not condon[ing] the\negregious behavior of the Government agents” – who met with the defendant without the\npermission or knowledge of her counsel, disparaged her counsel and told her she would\nface a stiff jail term if she did not cooperate – concluded that dismissal of the indictment\nwas “inappropriate where the violation . . . has had no adverse impact upon the criminal\nproceedings”; “absent demonstrable prejudice, or substantial threat thereof, dismissal of\nthe indictment is plainly inappropriate, even though the violation may have been\ndeliberate”].)\n       In this case, the trial court found there was no “egregious misconduct” by the Los\nAngeles prosecutors in the first place. Specifically, the court found that “it wasn’t this\nD.A.’s office that committed this egregious misconduct,” and that the Los Angeles\nprosecutor was not made aware of the objections that had been made in Orange County\nafter the seizure, and so had no obligation “three or four years after the fact to then bring\nto the court’s attention the fact that there might be some privileged material.”\nSubstantial evidence supported the trial court’s findings.\n       It was undisputed that the Los Angeles District Attorney had nothing to do with\nthe search of defendant’s home. There was no evidence that prosecutors Jackson or\nDixon relied on any privileged materials to make any decision in the trial of the case (and\nthere was evidence otherwise, in the form of Mr. Jackson’s declaration). Mr. Jackson\nalso told the court at a hearing: “I looked at tons of stuff, and I don’t remember looking\nat any attorney/client privilege stuff until [defense counsel] gave it to me. And it’s only\nthe items she’s given to me. I have not gone back and filtered through 60-odd boxes or\n40-odd boxes of stuff to look for other things.”\n\n                                             38\n\f       The trial court later reviewed the privileged material the special master had\nsegregated, and reiterated its earlier finding of no egregious misconduct by the\nprosecutors. Still later, the court repeated that once the case came to Los Angeles, there\nhad been no misconduct on the part of the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office.\nDefendant identified no privileged document relied on by the prosecutors to his prejudice\n(or at all), either at trial or on appeal.\n       Defendant is left to argue that the prosecutor may be taxed, for purposes of a claim\nof outrageous governmental misconduct, with actions taken or not taken by the Orange\nCounty prosecutor’s office. There is no pertinent authority for that notion, and we reject\nit. Defendant cites Brady and its progeny for the principle that the prosecutor is\nresponsible for disclosing evidence favorable to the defense, and that duty includes the\n“duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government’s\nbehalf in the case.” (Kyles v. Whitley (1995) 514 U.S. 419, 437; In re Brown (1998)\n17 Cal.4th 873, 879 (Brown) [courts have focused on the “ ‘ “ ‘prosecution team,’ ” ’ ”\nand “any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government’s behalf is\nimputed to the prosecution”].)\n       But the legal authorities on outrageous government misconduct do not employ the\n“prosecution team” principle, nor is there reason to do so. A Brady violation can be\nremedied only by providing the defense with the exculpatory material. Without the\n“prosecution team” principle, the prosecutor could “ ‘ “avoid disclosure of evidence by\nthe simple expedient of leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another\nagency while utilizing his access to it in preparing his case for trial,” [citation].’\n[Citations.]” (Brown, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 879.)\n       That principle has no logical application in the context of an outrageous\nmisconduct claim. Case authority likewise supports the conclusion that a prosecutor is\nnot chargeable with the outrageous misconduct of another agency. (See People v. Shrier\n(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 400, 405, 417 (Shrier) [dismissal was too drastic a remedy where\nlaw enforcement agents intentionally eavesdropped on attorney-client privileged\ncommunications; “[e]xclusion of overheard communications and any derivative evidence\n\n                                               39\n\fflowing therefrom” was the appropriate remedy; the prosecutor “was unaware of the\neavesdropping plan”]; Boulas v. Superior Court (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 422, 432\n(Boulas) [“There is no suggestion in [Morrison, supra, 449 U.S. 361] that the\nprosecutor’s office participated in the decision of the police officers to speak with the\ndefendant outside of the presence of her attorney. In contrast, the record before this court\ncontains substantial evidence of such participation on the part of a deputy district\nattorney.”].)\n       Defendant points out that the detective who headed the search team in Orange\nCounty was a member of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, and he “led the charge\nthat resulted in the wholesale seizure” of attorney-client privileged documents. But the\ntrial court expressly found the search warrant was properly executed. And while\ndefendant broadly claims the prosecutor’s “seizure, retention and review of the privileged\nmaterial” requires dismissal, he presents no argument supported by legal authorities for\nthe proposition that the warrant was improperly executed in the first instance.\n       Even if we were to hold the Los Angeles prosecutors responsible for all that went\nbefore, it would avail defendant nothing. “[A] showing of prejudice to defendant’s right\nto a fair trial [is] required” to sustain a due process claim of outrageous government\nconduct requiring dismissal. (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 861.) Defendant cites\nseveral California cases where dismissal of charges was upheld or required based on\nflagrant interference in defendant’s attorney-client relationship. But in all of them, not\nonly was the prosecutor complicit in an intentional interference between attorney and\nclient, but prejudice appeared on the face of the matter.\n       Neither factor applies here. In Boulas, for example, law enforcement officers,\nwith the tacit approval of the prosecutor, undermined the defendant’s relationship with\nhis attorney by telling the defendant that he had to fire his attorney and retain another\nattorney in order to secure a plea bargain. (Boulas, supra, 188 Cal.App.3d at p. 427.)\n“We find it to be beyond [peradventure] that the . . . course of conduct undertaken by law\nenforcement officials actively caused irremediable harm to Boulas’s relationship with his\nattorney and was, therefore, improper.” (Id. at p. 433.) Boulas points out that the high\n\n                                             40\n\fcourt in Morrison, which found dismissal an improper remedy in that case, “did not rule\nout the possibility of ordering the dismissal of a case upon a proper showing of\nprejudice.”8 (Boulas, at p. 431.) But there was no such showing here.\n       Defendant argues that prejudice may be presumed where the privileged documents\nto which the prosecutor has access “contain details of the defendant’s trial strategy,”\nciting federal cases where government informants participated in attorney-client\nconferences and provided the prosecution with confidential information about the\ndefense’s strategy or position. (E.g., United States v. Levy (3d Cir. 1978) 577 F.2d 200,\n208 (Levy) [actual disclosure of defense strategy occurred; “[w]here there is a knowing\ninvasion of the attorney-client relationship and where confidential information is\ndisclosed to the government, we think that there are overwhelming considerations\nmilitating against a standard which tests the sixth amendment violation by weighing how\nprejudicial to the defense the disclosure is”].)\n       The federal cases do not assist defendant. First, we need not follow federal\nauthorities other than the high court.9 Second, in this case the trial court did not find any\n\n\n8       See also Barber v. Municipal Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 742. There, an undercover\npolice officer posing as a codefendant attended confidential attorney-client conferences\nwith the other defendants (the district attorney knew he was a police officer and did not\ninform defense counsel). This was a violation of the right to counsel, and there was\nprejudice: “there was evidence that since the disclosure of [the officer’s] undercover\nrole, [the other defendants] had become reluctant to cooperate fully with their attorney.”\n(Id. at p. 755.) Dismissal was the appropriate remedy: “Whether or not the prosecution\nhas directly gained any confidential information which may be subject to suppression, the\nprosecution in this case has been aided by its agent’s conduct. [Codefendants] have been\nprejudiced in their ability to prepare their defense. They no longer feel they can freely,\ncandidly, and with complete confidence discuss their case with their attorney.” (Id. at\np. 756.)\n\n9      In any event, those authorities are split on the question whether a deliberate\nattempt by the government to obtain defense strategy information or to otherwise\ninterfere with the attorney-defendant relationship through the use of an undercover agent\nconstitutes a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment. (See United States v. Danielson\n(9th Cir. 2003) 325 F.3d 1054, 1070-1071, discussing cases; see also United States v.\nGlover (9th Cir. 1979) 596 F.2d 857, 863-864 & fn. 10 [government agent’s “attempt to\n\n                                              41\n\fdeliberate intrusion or “knowing invasion” by the Los Angeles prosecutor in the attorney-\nclient relationship, instead finding “they did not obtain any new information from their\naccidental review of the privileged material.” Third, defendant fails to identify in his\nopening brief any defense “strategy or position” that was revealed in the privileged\ndocuments. By contrast, in Levy the court specifically identified the defense strategy\nlearned by the prosecutor.10\n       Here, instead of pointing to any defense trial strategy or tactics that were revealed\nin the privileged materials, defendant argues the trial court’s remedy – the order not to\nuse privileged information at trial – was “impossible to enforce,” and it was “unrealistic\nto believe” the prosecutors did not use privileged information to their advantage.\nDefendant points to “between 150 and 200 pages” of privileged documents relating to\ndefendant’s federal criminal case (not to the murders). That case involved alleged\nbankruptcy fraud, and at the murder trial, the prosecutors called witnesses who testified,\nas mentioned previously, about transactions undertaken to move defendant’s business\nassets without paying the creditors, the transfer of assets to defendant’s wife, and so on.\nDefendant cites the testimony of these witnesses as showing “at least one critical instance\nof actual prejudice,” claiming the prosecutors used the privileged communications that\n\ninterfere with the attorney-client relationship, as reprehensible as it was,” did not amount\nto a constitutional violation of the right to counsel; “the existence or nonexistence of\nprejudicial evidence derived from an alleged interference with the attorney-client\nrelationship is relevant in determining if the defendant has been denied the right to\ncounsel”].)\n\n10      In Levy, the government learned that the defense intended to dispute the credibility\nof the government’s key witnesses, and “thereby necessarily became privy to the fact that\nthis was the only likely defense strategy that the prosecution had to anticipate.” (Levy,\nsupra, 577 F.2d at p. 208.) The government witnesses were two black men who claimed\nto be present at a private club where drug transactions took place, and “[t]he defense\nstrategy obviously would be to discredit the black witnesses by attempting to establish\nthat blacks were never admitted to that private club. The government’s knowledge of this\nplanned strategy would permit it not only to anticipate and counter such an attack on its\nwitnesses’ credibility, but also to select jurors who would be more receptive to the\ntestimony of black witnesses against white ethnic defendants.” (Ibid.)\n\n\n                                             42\n\fpertained to the federal criminal proceedings “in formulating the prosecution’s case for\nmotive,” and “chang[ed] theories of the case based upon the content of [defendant’s]\nprivileged documents.” (The Orange County prosecutors charged defendant with\nconspiracy and murder for financial gain, and defendant claims, without citing to any\nparticular documents, that his communications with his lawyer exposed the fallacy in the\nnotion that defendant stood to gain financially from Mr. Thompson’s death.)\n       But this is pure speculation. Defense counsel admitted below that “I can’t say\nwhether [the prosecutors] read these documents and therefore changed their mind. I can’t\nsay if they just are a little bit more on the ball than the district attorneys in Orange\nCounty. I can say that the appearance of impropriety is large.” Speculation, without\nreference to any supporting evidence, does not suffice, and it seems obvious the question\nof financial gain or its absence could be investigated and determined without regard to\nprivileged communications. Defendant points to nothing to show the prosecutors used\nany privileged document, or evidence derived from a privileged document, and the\nprosecutor avers none of the documents were used to make any prosecutorial decision.\nAs for the financial witnesses, they were intimately involved in the bankruptcy litigation,\nthus accounting for their trial testimony. There was no showing they were privy to any\nprivileged documents, and defendant does not attempt to trace any testimony to a\nprivileged source. Dismissal cannot be based on unsupported speculation.11\n\n\n\n11     Defendant also cites a Connecticut opinion, State v. Lenarz (2011) 301 Conn. 417,\nwhere the court “conclude[d] generally that prejudice may be presumed when the\nprosecutor has invaded the attorney-client privilege by reading privileged materials\ncontaining trial strategy, regardless of whether the invasion of the attorney-client\nprivilege was intentional,” and the state may rebut that presumption by clear and\nconvincing evidence. (Id. at p. 425.) California cases do not so hold, and in any event, in\nLenarz, the court found both that the privileged materials “contained a detailed, explicit\nroad map of the defendant’s trial strategy” (id. at p. 451); “the defendant was prejudiced\nby the prosecutor’s intrusion into the privileged communications” (id. at p. 442); and the\nstate had the burden to prove that any prejudice could be cured by a less drastic remedy\nthan dismissal (id. at pp. 443-444), which it could not do in that case (id. at p. 445). No\nsimilar findings were made, or could have been made, here.\n\n                                              43\n\f       Defendant also cites Morrow v. Superior Court (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1252\n(Morrow). There, the court held: “Where a prosecutor orchestrates courtroom\neavesdropping on a privileged attorney-client communication and the witnesses thereto\ninvoke the privilege against self-incrimination, the prosecution may not successfully\noppose a motion to dismiss on the ground that no prejudice has been shown.” (Id. at\np. 1258.) In those circumstances, “the court’s conscience is shocked and dismissal is the\nappropriate remedy. Even when the issue is narrowed to a Sixth Amendment violation,\ndismissal is still appropriate because here there is a ‘substantial threat of demonstrable\nprejudice’ as a matter of law.” (Id. at p. 1251, citing Morrison, supra, 449 U.S. at\np. 365.) This case bears no comparison to Morrow; here, the prosecutor engaged in no\nmisconduct, and indeed demonstrated to the satisfaction of the trial court that nothing in\nthe privileged materials was or would be used to the prejudice of defendant. (See Shrier,\nsupra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 405, 417 [exclusion of overheard communications and any\nderivative evidence was the appropriate remedy for eavesdropping on attorney-client\ncommunications where prosecutor was unaware of the eavesdropping plan].)\n       In sum, substantial evidence supported the trial court’s conclusion that the\nprosecutors here engaged in no misconduct, and that in any event their review of\nattorney-client privileged material did not result in the prejudice to defendant that is\nnecessary to justify the sanction of dismissal. Our independent review of the record\nconfirms the absence of any “outrageous conduct in the constitutional sense of violating\ndefendant’s due process rights . . . .” (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 858.) And\nthere was no showing of any use of privileged documents or information derived from\nthem by the prosecutors in trying the case. In short, the required showing of prejudice to\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial was absent and precluded dismissal. (Id. at p. 861.) As\nthe high court said in Morrison, “[c]ases involving Sixth Amendment deprivations are\nsubject to the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the\nconstitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests,”\nand “[o]ur approach has thus been to identify and then neutralize the taint by tailoring\nrelief appropriate in the circumstances to assure the defendant the effective assistance of\n\n                                             44\n\fcounsel and a fair trial.” (Morrison, supra, 449 U.S. at pp. 364, 365.) That is exactly\nwhat the trial court did here.\n               ii. Recusal issues\n         Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motions to recuse the Los\nAngeles District Attorney’s office, or to remove prosecutors Jackson and Dixon from\ndefendant’s prosecution. We review this claim “only for an abuse of discretion.”\n(Hariguchi v. Superior Court (2008) 43 Cal.4th 706, 711-712, fns. omitted (Hariguchi)\n[“The trial court’s findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence, its conclusions\nof law are reviewed de novo, and its application of the law to the facts is reversible only\nif arbitrary and capricious.”].) We find no abuse of discretion.\n         Under section 1424, a motion to disqualify a district attorney “may not be granted\nunless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely\nthat the defendant would receive a fair trial.” (Id., subd. (a)(1).) Section 1424 establishes\n“a two-part test: (i) is there a conflict of interest?; and (ii) is the conflict so severe as to\ndisqualify the district attorney from acting? Thus, while a ‘conflict’ exists whenever\nthere is a ‘reasonable possibility that the DA’s office may not exercise its discretionary\nfunction in an evenhanded manner,’ the conflict is disabling only if it is ‘so grave as to\nrender it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nEubanks (1996) 14 Cal.4th 580, 594, 583-584 (Eubanks) [substantial financial assistance\nvictim provided to district attorney’s office resulted in a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest].) “The statute demands a showing of a real, not merely apparent, potential for\nunfair treatment, and further requires that that potential ‘rise to the level of a likelihood of\nunfairness.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Vasquez (2006) 39 Cal.4th 47, 56 (Vasquez).) The\ndefendant “bear[s] the burden of demonstrating a genuine conflict; in the absence of any\nsuch conflict, a trial court should not interfere with the People’s prerogative to select who\nis to represent them.” (Hariguchi, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 709.)\n         We have already recited at length, in connection with defendant’s dismissal\narguments, the relevant facts. Those facts lead to the same result: no error by the trial\ncourt.\n\n                                                45\n\f       Here, the trial court repeatedly found that no conflict existed. In June 2005: “The\nonly thing I can say is that the People are in possession of privileged material, that . . .\nthey agreed not to use that material in any way and not to use any evidence obtained as a\nresult of that material in the trial,” and “there is no showing that the defendant would\nreceive anything other than a fair trial based on the possession of this information.” In\nFebruary 2006: “But I am convinced of what I said a month ago. I don’t believe this is a\n[section] 1424 situation.” In March 2006: “This is not a [section] 1424 situation in my\nopinion and I think I have been consistent in saying that.”\n       Defendant fails entirely to identify any conflict of interest, merely repeating his\nclaim that the “prosecution team intentionally and illegally invaded the defense team” by\nseizing and reviewing privileged communications and “us[ing] them to form their\ntheories of the case.” First, as we have seen, that is not a proper characterization of the\nprosecutor’s conduct; the prosecutor saw privileged communications, but his conduct was\nnot intentional, and he did not “use them to form [the prosecution’s] theories of the case.”\nAs the Supreme Court has said, “[t]he trial court was entitled to credit [the prosecutor],\nand his statements constitute substantial evidence.” (Hollywood v. Superior Court (2008)\n43 Cal.4th 721, 730 (Hollywood).) Second, defendant showed no conflict of interest – no\n“ ‘reasonable possibility that the DA’s office may not exercise its discretionary function\nin an evenhanded manner.’ [Citation.]” (Eubanks, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 594.)\n       Vasquez explains the point: public prosecutors “are required to exercise their\ndiscretionary functions “ ‘ “with the highest degree of integrity and impartiality.” ’\n[Citation.] Impartiality, in this context, means . . . that the prosecutor is ‘expected to\nexercise his or her discretionary functions in the interests of the People at large, and not\nunder the influence or control of an interested individual.’ [Citation.]” (Vasquez, supra,\n39 Cal.4th at p. 55 [because of a close family relationship between longtime employees\nof the prosecutor’s office and the defendant, there was a “ ‘reasonable possibility that the\nDA’s office may not exercise its discretionary function in an evenhanded manner’ ”]; see\nalso Hollywood, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 731 [trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding no cognizable conflict of interest under section 1424, where prosecutor disclosed\n\n                                              46\n\fcase files to filmmaker and acted as a consultant on a movie about the defendant’s life\nand alleged crimes; “[w]hile in the abstract it is conceivable a fear of criminal sanctions\nmight alter how [the prosecutor] handled this case, the trial court found [the prosecutor]\ncredible and concluded the possibility that confidential documents might have been\ndisclosed inadvertently would not prevent [the prosecutor] from acting fairly toward [the\ndefendant]”; that conclusion “does not appear arbitrary or capricious and is supported by\nsubstantial evidence”].)\n       Defendant cannot explain how the prosecutor’s exposure to privileged materials\ncreated a conflict of interest such that the prosecutor might not exercise his discretionary\nfunctions in an evenhanded manner. As Hollywood tells us, “section 1424 does not exist\nas a free-form vehicle through which to express judicial condemnation of distasteful, or\neven improper, prosecutorial actions. [S]ection 1424 offers no relief for actions simply\nbecause they appear, or are, improper. [Citations.] The Legislature has closely defined\nthe limits of judicial authority to recuse prosecutors, and we must observe them. . . .\nA defendant must identify, and a court must find some conflict of interest that renders it\nunlikely the defendant will receive a fair trial.” (Hollywood, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 735,\nfn. omitted.) The trial court found none here, and we can find no abuse of its discretion\nin that finding.\n       Defendant next argues that, apart from Penal Code section 1424, the court had\ninherent power under Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(4) to remove\nprosecutors Jackson and Dixon. Under that statute, every court has the power to “compel\nobedience to its judgments, orders, and process,” and to “control in furtherance of justice,\nthe conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected\nwith a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto.” (Code Civ.\nProc., § 128, subd. (a)(4)&(5).) But section 1424 now specifies the requirements for\ndisqualification, and it was enacted in response to the case which established that\nsection 128 gives the court power to remove a prosecutor. (People v. Superior Court\n(Greer) (1977) 19 Cal.3d 255, 269 [concluding, before the enactment of section 1424,\nthat “a trial judge may exercise his power to disqualify a district attorney from\n\n                                             47\n\fparticipating in the prosecution of a criminal charge when the judge determines that the\nattorney suffers from a conflict of interest which might prejudice him against the accused\nand thereby affect, or appear to affect, his ability to impartially perform the discretionary\nfunctions of his office”]; see Eubanks, supra, 14 Cal.4th at pp. 590-591 [section 1424\nallows disqualification “only when a conflict ‘render[s] it unlikely that the defendant\nwould receive a fair trial,’ [citation] whereas Greer allowed disqualification even when\nthe conflict might merely ‘appear to affect’ the prosecutor’s fairness”].) But the point is\nthat “a conflict of interest which might prejudice [the prosecutor] against the accused”\n(Eubanks, at p. 591) is required for recusal, and there was no such conflict in this case.\n       Even in a case where the circumstances present a conflict of interest, the conflict\nwould be disabling only if it makes it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.\n(Eubanks, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 594.) That returns us to the point we have already\ndecided in connection with defendant’s claim the trial court should have dismissed the\ncase for outrageous government misconduct: There was no showing of prejudice to\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial, so any conflict of interest that might be identified under\nsection 1424 would not render it “ ‘unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.’\n[Citation.]” (Eubanks, at p. 594; see also People v. Griffin (2004) 33 Cal.4th 536, 570,\nfn. 15 [“Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's\nmotion for an order recusing the district attorney’s office for a conflict of interest, we\nreject as well defendant’s claim that the trial court’s asserted error violated his rights\nunder the United States Constitution, specifically . . . the due process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.”].) In short, there was no error in the court’s refusal to recuse\nthe prosecutors.\n       Finally, defendant makes one other point. He contends the right to counsel is\nviolated when a state agent is present at attorney-client conferences, and that Detective\nLillienfeld obtained privileged information by “using someone from the defense camp as\na spy for several weeks,” and “knew Butch Jones was providing him information\nMr. Jones had gleaned from his presence at attorney-client conferences.” In this\nargument, defendant fails to acknowledge that the court took testimony from defendant’s\n\n                                              48\n\fthen-lawyer (Jeffrey Benice), from Detective Lillienfeld, and from Mr. Jones, and found\notherwise.\n       Specifically, the court found there was no “intentional act on the part of law\nenforcement to interfere with the attorney/client privilege or to obtain privileged\nmaterial.” “There may have been some relationship that existed between Mr. Jones and\nMr. Benice, but I can’t say that Detective Lillienfeld attempted to intentionally obtain\nprivileged information from that relationship by virtue of his contact with Mr. Jones.”\nDetective Lillienfeld testified that Mr. Jones told him on one occasion that defendant was\ngoing to meet with Mr. Benice on defense strategy, but he never indicated that he\n(Mr. Jones) attended any such meeting, and “the contents of that meeting” were never\nsupplied to Detective Lillienfeld. Mr. Jones also told the detective, who confirmed the\ninformation, that defendant, not Mr. Benice, paid Mr. Jones, whose job was as a runner, a\nmessenger, and a researcher for defendant. Mr. Benice testified that, at defendant’s\nsuggestion, he paid Mr. Jones once or twice to review and obtain documents from case\nfiles concerning Mickey Thompson’s estate, but Mr. Jones did no substantive legal work\nfor him, and he did not invite Mr. Jones into strategy meetings. And Mr. Jones testified\nthat he never supplied Detective Lillienfeld with information he gleaned from meetings\nwith defendant and Mr. Benice.\n       In short, substantial evidence supported the trial court’s finding that there was no\nintentional interference with the attorney-client relationship through the use of Mr. Jones\nas an informer – in contrast to both cases defendant cites. (See Barber, supra, 24 Cal.3d\nat p. 755 [finding a violation of the right to counsel and prejudice from the violation; see\nfn. 8, ante] and Morrow, supra, 30 Cal.App.4th at p. 1258 [prosecutor orchestrated\ncourtroom eavesdropping on attorney-client communication]; see also Weatherford v.\nBursey (1977) 429 U.S. 545, 558 [“unless [undercover agent] communicated the\nsubstance of the [attorney-client] conversations and thereby created at least a realistic\npossibility of injury to [the defendant] or benefit to the State, there can be no Sixth\nAmendment violation”; “[t]here being no tainted evidence . . . , no communication of\n\n\n\n                                              49\n\fdefense strategy to the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion by [undercover agent],\nthere was no violation of the Sixth Amendment”].)\n       In the end, defendant’s argument is that “the record cannot fully disclose the\nextent to which [prosecutorial] decisions were affected – whether consciously or\nsubconsciously – by the privileged information they reviewed,” and so there was\nstructural error requiring reversal of the judgment. Defendant made the same argument\nto the trial court: “Every decision that they’re [(the prosecutors)] going to make cannot\nbe said to now not be derived from the reading of those documents,” and “[t]here is\nsimply no way for anyone to know what parts of the case that form Mr. Jackson’s\nthoughts on prosecution were derived from these letters.” That is simply not the law.\n       There was no error in the trial court’s denial of defendant’s motions to dismiss or\nto recuse the prosecutors.\n2. The Insufficient Evidence Claim\n       Defendant claims the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. This\nargument includes two principle components: first, that there was no evidence of any\nassociation or agreement between defendant and the killers (and hence “no corpus\n[delicti] to prove a conspiracy”) and second, the eyewitness identification testimony of\nRonald and Tonyia Stevens was not “substantial, credible evidence [defendant] engaged\nin a conspiracy to murder the Thompsons.” Defendant is mistaken.\n       “When the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction is challenged on\nappeal, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to\ndetermine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\nfrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. [Citation.] ‘Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion\ndo not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge\nor jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon\nwhich a determination depends.’ [Citation.] Unless it describes facts or events that are\nphysically impossible or inherently improbable, the testimony of a single witness is\nsufficient to support a conviction.” (People v. Elliott (2012) 53 Cal.4th 535, 585\n\n                                              50\n\f(Elliott).) So, “ ‘if the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we must accord due\ndeference to the trier of fact and not substitute our evaluation of a witness’s credibility for\nthat of the fact finder. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Ochoa (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199,\n1206 (Ochoa).)\n       As a preliminary matter, we note defendant’s claim there was “no corpus [delicti]\nto prove a conspiracy” is simply inapt. Defendant was not charged with conspiracy. He\nwas charged with murder. To convict a defendant of a crime, the prosecutor must prove\nthat a crime – “the corpus delicti or body of the crime” – actually occurred, and the\nprosecutor may not rely exclusively on the defendant’s extrajudicial statements to do so.\n(People v. Alvarez (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1164-1165 (Alvarez).) As the facts we have\nrecited show, the occurrence of the crimes with which defendant was charged – multiple\nmurders committed by means of lying in wait – is not open to question.\n       Conspiracy was merely one of the theories of liability by which the prosecution\nsought to establish that defendant was responsible for those crimes. There is no support\nin the authorities or in logic for the proposition that the corpus delicti rule may be applied\nto a theory of liability. The rule “is intended to ensure that one will not be falsely\nconvicted, by his or her untested words alone, of a crime that never happened.” (Alvarez,\nsupra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1169.) The two charged murders happened – and once there is\nindependent evidence of a crime, “the defendant’s extrajudicial statements may then be\nconsidered for their full value to strengthen the case on all issues.” (Id. at p. 1171.) That\nis so here.\n       And so we turn to the substance of defendant’s claim: whether there was\ninsufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant conspired to kill\nthe Thompsons. A conspiracy is an agreement to commit the crime, and the essence of\ndefendant’s claim is that there was no evidence of any association with, or agreement\nwith, the unknown killers to commit the murders – the sine qua non of conspiracy. He\npoints out that a legal inference cannot flow from the nonexistence of a fact, and may not\nbe based on suspicion or conjecture or guesswork. (People v. Stein (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d\n235, 239.)\n\n                                              51\n\f       We do not agree there was no evidence of an agreement to murder the Thompsons.\nCertainly there was no direct evidence of defendant’s association or agreement with the\nactual killers. But a conspiracy “ ‘may be proved by indirect evidence and inferences\njustified by the circumstances. [Citations.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. Hardeman (1966)\n244 Cal.App.2d 1, 41; People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1135 [“Evidence is\nsufficient to prove a conspiracy to commit a crime ‘if it supports an inference that the\nparties positively or tacitly came to a mutual understanding to commit a crime.\n[Citation.] The existence of a conspiracy may be inferred from the conduct, relationship,\ninterests, and activities of the alleged conspirators before and during the alleged\nconspiracy.”].)\n       Here, the circumstances fully justified the inference that defendant conspired with\nthe shooters. While defendant tells us what evidence was absent (such as evidence of\npayments to the shooters, telephone records, witnesses to defendant’s solicitation of the\nmurders, meetings or talks with the shooters), he ignores the evidence that was adduced.\nThe Thompsons were killed in a carefully planned operation for which there was no\nrobbery or other motive (ante, pp. 15-19). Defendant was present in the neighborhood\nwith binoculars and another person a few days before the murders (ante, pp. 13-14). The\nshooters knew where and when to find the Thompsons, how to get to their house, and\nhow best to escape the scene (ante, pp. 16-18). Defendant repeatedly threatened to kill\nMickey Thompson and hurt his family (ante, pp. 6-13) and indeed made statements to\ntwo witnesses about the cost involved in having Mr. Thompson killed (ante, pp. 8-9), and\ntold others he was too smart to get caught (ante, p. 7). These facts were placed in\nevidence, and the jury could properly infer from them that defendant agreed with the\nshooters to commit the murders.\n       To this, defendant’s answer is to characterize defendant’s presence near the\nThompson home as a “highly speculative ‘fact’ ” that was “not sufficient,” even if the\nStevenses’ eyewitness identifications were credible, which he claims they were not.\nNeither of these arguments assists defendant. He says his presence in the neighborhood\nshortly before the murders “is simply too tenuous and speculative” to support a finding of\n\n                                             52\n\fan agreement to commit murder. In the abstract and without any other evidence,\ndefendant might be right – but there was other evidence (delineated in the preceding\nparagraph), and defendant ignores it. As the jury was instructed, properly, the “formation\nand existence of a conspiracy may be inferred from all circumstances tending to show the\ncommon intent . . . .”12\n       At its core, defendant’s argument is that the eyewitness testimony of Ronald and\nTonyia Stevens is not substantial, credible evidence, and without it he cannot be\nconnected to the murders. We disagree with defendant’s premise.\n       Defendant recites at length various inconsistencies between the Stevenses’\ntestimony at trial and their testimony at the preliminary hearing and interviews with the\npolice. (These inconsistencies include statements about the race of the passenger in the\ncar with defendant, how far away Mr. Stevens was when he saw defendant, for how long\nand at what angle he saw defendant, and so on.) Defendant challenges the photographic\nand live lineup procedures as “suggestive and unreliable.” He points out that in the\nphotos, there was only one man “that had any sort of pock marks.” He says Mr. Stevens\nadmitted on cross-examination that he had pointed to three different photos, saying “this\ntype of nose” and “that type of hair” and “this type of complexion,” and that\nDetective Lillienfeld posed the question, “Yeah, but the guy you saw in the wagon that\n\n\n\n\n12       Defendant relies on United States v. Todd (8th Cir. 1981) 657 F.2d 212, where the\ndefendant’s conviction for murder was affirmed but his conviction for conspiracy to\nmurder was reversed. The only evidence of conspiracy to murder was that all the\nprincipals (defendant, his alleged coconspirators, and the victim) were members of the\nsame basic training company at Ft. Leonard Wood, and defendant said he and his alleged\ncoconspirators intended to rob the victim. The court held it was improper to convict\ndefendant of conspiracy to murder based on an assumption that they also intended to\nmurder the victim so he would not identify them after the robbery. (Id. at p. 217\n[“Although the government is allowed to prove an agreement by circumstantial evidence,\n. . . here there is only speculation and inference.”].) We fail to see any favorable\ncomparison between the evidence in this case, where defendant stated his intent to kill\nMr. Thompson and discussed hiring someone to do so, and the speculation in Todd.\n\n\n                                            53\n\fday that most resembles who in this photo array now?” rather than admonishing\nMr. Stevens that the suspect might or might not be in the photo array.\n       Mr. Stevens viewed a live lineup five months later, where defendant was the only\nperson whose photo was also in the photographic lineup, and the only person with pock-\nmarked skin. (Tonyia Stevens also viewed that lineup, separately, and identified\ndefendant. She had seen defendant on a newscast (footage of four to six men walking out\nof a courtroom, with no mention of defendant’s name) and recognized him as the person\nshe saw in the car before the murders; at the time, she told her husband she was sure he\nwould remember him too.) Defendant also cites numerous cases and studies discussing\nthe unreliability of eyewitness identifications and suggested reforms in identification\nprocedures. And he cites the many other factors that reduce the reliability of\nidentifications: lapse of time (13 years), limited opportunity to observe, intervening\ninfluences affecting memory (such as reenactments of the crime on television), and so on.\n       Nonetheless, Mr. and Ms. Stevens did in fact testify that it was defendant they saw\nwith binoculars in an old station wagon with Arizona license plates parked near their\nhome a few days before the murders. And Kathy Weese offered some corroboration\nwhen she testified that while she was working for defendant’s company, on one occasion\nshe saw an older station wagon with out-of-state plates in the parking lot; it had never\nbeen there before and she never saw it again. The jury heard all this evidence, including\nall the inconsistencies defendant cites, and also heard testimony from defendant’s expert\nwitness on eyewitness identifications, explaining all the factors supporting the\nunreliability of identifications made under the circumstances existing in this case. The\njury also heard defendant’s arguments about the unreliability of the Stevenses’\nidentifications. It was for them to decide whether or not they believed the Stevenses’\ntestimony.\n       In his reply brief, defendant contends the issue is “not about reassessing witness\ncredibility,” but about the “inherent unreliability of eyewitness identifications obtained\nunder circumstances that corrupt human memory,” as shown in the studies he cites\n(studies not presented to the trial court). But we are bound by the law as stated by the\n\n                                             54\n\fSupreme Court, and that court has expressly rejected claims that eyewitness testimony\nwas unreliable “because the witnesses’ initial descriptions of the perpetrator were\ninconsistent and because the identification testimony was tainted by suggestive lineups\nand photo arrays, and by the passage of time.” (Elliott, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 585\n[“Inconsistencies in [the witnesses’] initial descriptions of the perpetrator and any\nsuggestiveness in the lineups or photo arrays they were shown are matters affecting the\nwitnesses’ credibility, which is for the jury to resolve.”]; see also In re Gustavo M. (1989)\n214 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1497 [“when the circumstances surrounding the identification and\nits weight are explored at length at trial, where eyewitness identification is believed by\nthe trier of fact, that determination is binding on the reviewing court”].) In short, we\nnecessarily decline defendant’s invitation to hold as a matter of law that the Stevenses’\nidentifications were unreliable.\n       In sum, though the jury could have disbelieved the Stevenses’ testimony, for all\nthe reasons defendant presented to it, the jury chose to believe them. Their testimony\nconstitutes substantial evidence, and it was not the only evidence connecting defendant to\nthe crime, as we have already pointed out; there was evidence of a carefully planned and\ncoordinated execution and escape that required research and reconnaissance, defendant’s\nrepeated statements of intent to kill Mickey Thompson and hurt his family, and\nstatements about the cost of having Mr. Thompson killed. From all this evidence, the\njury could reasonably infer an agreement by defendant with the shooters to commit the\nmurders.\n       Finally, we note that, in his motion for a new trial, defendant presented an\naffidavit from the jury foreperson, saying, among other things, that he was initially\nreluctant to vote for conviction because of no evidence “connecting [defendant] to the\nactual killers, even though most of the other evidence pointed towards guilt”; that the\nconspiracy instruction allowed the jury to infer from “all of the other incriminating\nevidence” that defendant wanted Mickey Thompson dead “and could have hired the\nkillers to commit the crime even though no evidence of a connection between the\nconspirators was presented”; and, since the jury concluded it was reasonable to believe\n\n                                             55\n\fdefendant “could have been responsible,” “we felt we reconciled that lack of connection\nto the killers by applying the instruction on conspiracy, which allowed us to infer that\nconnection.”\n       We may not consider these statements (which in any event appear merely to\nreflect defendant’s mistaken notion that a direct – rather than circumstantial – link\nbetween defendant and the actual killers must be shown). Under Evidence Code\nsection 1150, “[n]o evidence is admissible . . . concerning the mental processes by which\n[the verdict] was determined.” (Id., subd. (a); see People v. Gonzales (2012) 54 Cal.4th\n1234, 1281 [“The jurors’ statements about the mental processes by which that verdict was\nreached were expressly barred by . . . section 1150.”].) The trial court, we note,\nnevertheless considered the foreperson’s declaration, saying it “tend[ed] to agree that . . .\nprobably a portion of it got into what is prohibited by [section] 1150,” but “I’m\nconsidering that declaration and accepting it at face value.” Nonetheless, the trial court\nconcluded that, while “this was a circumstantial evidence case with nothing – no direct\nevidence to connect [defendant], . . . the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming.”\nWe agree.\n3. The Delay in Prosecution\n       Defendant was arrested on December 13, 2001, for murders that occurred in\nMarch 1988, and his preliminary hearing in Los Angeles occurred in October 2004. In\nJanuary 2006, defendant filed a motion to dismiss because of the lengthy delay, and\nasked the court to defer ruling on the motion until completion of the trial. The trial court\ndid so, and ultimately denied the motion.\n       Defendant contends on appeal the delay in prosecuting him was unjustified and\nprejudicial: that the evidence offered at the trial in 2006 was “essentially identical to\nwhat the [Los Angeles District Attorney] could have mustered for trial soon after the\nkillings in 1988,” and in the interim, “the defense evidence faded away almost\ncompletely.” We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\ndefendant’s motion.\n\n\n\n                                             56\n\f          a. The governing principles\n          The pertinent legal principles are these. The due process clauses of the federal and\nCalifornia Constitutions “protect a defendant from the prejudicial effects of lengthy,\nunjustified delay between the commission of a crime and the defendant’s arrest and\ncharging.” (People v. Cowan (2010) 50 Cal.4th 401, 430 (Cowan).) “ ‘ “[T]he right of\ndue process protects a criminal defendant’s interest in fair adjudication by preventing\nunjustified delays that weaken the defense through the dimming of memories, the death\nor disappearance of witnesses, and the loss or destruction of material physical evidence.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) “ ‘ “A defendant seeking to dismiss a charge on this\nground must demonstrate prejudice arising from the delay. The prosecution may offer\njustification for the delay, and the court considering a motion to dismiss balances the\nharm to the defendant against the justification for the delay.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(Ibid.)\n          “Prejudice may be shown by ‘ “loss of material witnesses due to lapse of time\n[citation] or loss of evidence because of fading memory attributable to the delay.” ’ ”\n(Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 430.) While “the federal constitutional standard for what\nconstitutes sufficient justification for delay is unclear [citation], we have noted that ‘the\nlaw under the California Constitution is at least as favorable for defendant in this regard’\nas federal law [citation].”13 (Id. at pp. 430-431.)\n          “Under the California standard, ‘negligent, as well as purposeful, delay in bringing\ncharges may, when accompanied by a showing of prejudice, violate due process. This\ndoes not mean, however, that whether the delay was purposeful or negligent is\nirrelevant.’ [Citation.] Rather, ‘whether the delay was negligent or purposeful is relevant\n\n13      In People v. Nelson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1242 (Nelson), the court discussed the\nfederal standard at some length. Nelson observed that the high court has said that “ ‘the\nFifth Amendment requires the dismissal of an indictment, even if it is brought within the\nstatute of limitations, if the defendant can prove that the Government’s delay in bringing\nthe indictment was a deliberate device to gain an advantage over him and that it caused\nhim actual prejudice in presenting his defense,’ ” but that some of the high court’s earlier\ncases “suggest the test might be somewhat less onerous.” (Id. at pp. 1253-1254.)\n\n\n                                               57\n\fto the balancing process. Purposeful delay to gain an advantage is totally unjustified, and\na relatively weak showing of prejudice would suffice to tip the scales towards finding a\ndue process violation. If the delay was merely negligent, a greater showing of prejudice\nwould be required to establish a due process violation.’ [Citation.] The justification for\nthe delay is strong when there is ‘investigative delay, nothing else.’ [Citation.]” (Cowan,\nsupra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 431.)\n       “We review for abuse of discretion a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for\nprejudicial prearrest delay [citation], and defer to any underlying factual findings if\nsubstantial evidence supports them [citation].”14 (Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 431.)\n       b. The trial court’s ruling\n       Defendant’s position is that the trial court erred in finding justification for the\ndelay, and in addition that the court “skipped the third step – balancing prejudice against\nthe prosecutor’s justification – altogether.” Thus, defendant contends, because the\nprosecutor’s showing of justification was “insubstantial,” if defendant showed “even\nminimal prejudice, the trial judge’s error in not undertaking the required weighing\nrequires reversal.”\n       We do not agree with either point in defendant’s analysis. To begin, we describe\nthe court’s ruling in some detail. We then review defendant’s claims of prejudice (pt. c.,\npost) and the prosecutor’s justification (pt. d., post), and conclude there was no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court’s refusal to dismiss the case for prearrest delay.15\n\n14     Defendant compares this case to People v. Cromer (2001) 24 Cal.4th 889 and\nconcludes we must employ de novo review. Cromer was not a case of prearrest delay. In\nCromer, the court held that appellate courts “should independently review a trial court’s\ndetermination that the prosecution’s failed efforts to locate an absent witness are\nsufficient to justify an exception to the defendant’s constitutionally guaranteed right of\nconfrontation at trial.” (Id. at p. 901.) Cowan was decided years after Cromer, and its\nstatement of the standard of review on a motion to dismiss for prearrest delay could not\nbe clearer.\n\n15     Defendant says he was “substantially handicapped” in preparing and arguing the\nprearrest delay issue in the trial court, because the court refused to order daily transcripts.\nHe does not, however, identify any evidence in the record that he did not bring to the trial\n\n                                              58\n\f          Some of the trial court’s comments suggest its belief that a legitimate reason for\nthe delay in prosecution would be dispositive, without regard to defendant’s showing of\nprejudice. But the court did in fact find prejudice to defendant (and to the prosecution, as\nwell) from the delay, and a fair reading of its analysis shows an implicit, if not explicit,\nbalancing of the prejudice against the justification.\n          After first correctly rejecting the prosecutor’s contention that a defendant must\nshow intentional delay by the government, this is what the trial court said: “[T]o prevail\non due process grounds . . . the defense has to show some actual prejudice by the delay.\n[¶] Once the defendant shows some actual prejudice, . . . the burden shifts and the court\nhas to find that there was no legitimate reason for the delay.” The court then said that the\nsecond question was the easiest to answer, and it would answer that first: “There appears\nto me to be ample reason why this case took so long to result in an arrest of\n[defendant]. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . [S]imply based on the evidence that I heard at this trial,\nthere were new witnesses that came forward in 2001. It appears that . . . Ron and\nTonyia Stevens made an identification in 2001 and although they attempted to contact\nlaw enforcement before, the fact of the matter is that the identification was not made until\n2001.” The judge also mentioned Gail Moreau-Hunter’s information, presented at the\npreliminary hearing but not at trial, that defendant made a statement to her “where he at\nthe very least suggested that he was responsible for the murders.” The court observed\nthat when the new information – the identifications and Ms. Moreau-Hunter’s statements\n– was obtained in 2001, the sheriff’s department did not delay in presenting the case for\nfiling.\n          The court then said: “There were ample reasons for the delay. And I think that, in\nand of itself, is dispositive, I will be honest with you. I think that the court doesn’t have\nto even address the first question [prejudice]. [¶] But for purposes of this record, let me\ngo ahead and attempt to at least clarify what I think the standard is. I don’t know that\n\n\ncourt’s attention, or that he was unable to bring to the court's attention because he did not\nhave daily transcripts.\n\n\n                                               59\n\fthere is any authority for the proposition that the court has to assume that every witness\nthat was unavailable for the trial would have presented testimony favorable to the\naccused. [¶] . . . [¶] . . . I don’t know that any of the evidence that was not presented\nbecause of the delay would have been beneficial to the defendant. But what I can say is\nthat the evidence that was presented at the trial by the prosecution was certainly hindered\nby the delay.” (Boldface & italics added.)\n       The court noted the case was aggressively defended, with the defense doing an\n“excellent job in presenting to the jury . . . the problems inherent in a lot of the testimony\npresented by the People. [¶] And those problems were in large part due to a lack of\nrecollection; a lack of physical evidence that may have existed in this case. So the\nbottom line I think it’s fair to say the delay did not just prejudice – potentially prejudice\nthe defense. The delay prejudiced I think both sides in this case. And that’s unfortunate.\nBut I’m not going to assume that every witness that wasn’t called would have testified\nfavorably . . . for [defendant]. [¶] However, even . . . if I make that assumption, I then\nget to that second question: was there a legitimate reason for the delay? Whereby the\nanswer is yes. [¶] So no matter how I look at it, given the legal standard that I believe\napplies on this case, I have made inquiry into whether or not there was prejudice. I agree\nthere was prejudice, but there was a legitimate reason for the delay.”\n       The court pointed out that the Court of Appeal in Orange County, when it ruled\nvenue was not proper there, “did point out this new evidence that was presented or\ndiscovered,” and “practically begged Los Angeles to take another look at this case.” The\ncourt continued: “I think there was ongoing investigation. I know that Detective\nLillienfeld took over the case and pursued the case. And I can’t fault anyone for the fact\nthat it took so long to actually get enough evidence to file the case. And at the behest of\nthe Court of Appeal that’s what the L.A. County District Attorney did. [¶] So given all\nof that, I do not believe that there has been anything that rises to the level of due process\nviolation here. . . . [F]rom what I can glean from the cases that have been cited, the due\nprocess violation has not been established.”\n\n\n\n                                               60\n\f       It thus appears that the court, while not expressly balancing the prejudice to\ndefendant against the justification for the delay, implicitly did just that: The court plainly\nconcluded it could not fault anyone for the length of time that elapsed in the investigation\nbefore the authorities charged defendant. And the court further concluded, correctly, that\nit would be wrong to assume that every unavailable witness would have provided\ntestimony favorable to defendant. Indeed, the court went so far as to observe that “I don’t\nknow that any of the evidence that was not presented because of the delay would have\nbeen beneficial to the defendant.” (Italics added.) Based on these findings by the court,\nthe balancing of prejudice against justification could have only one result.\n       And so, the question for us is whether the trial court abused its discretion in\nmaking those findings and concluding there was no due process violation. We think not,\nand turn first to defendant’s showing of prejudice.\n       c. Defendant’s claims of prejudice\n       Defendant asserts prejudice from the loss of material witnesses, loss of\ndocumentary evidence, and witnesses’ failing memories. We address his claims of\nprejudice in the order he has raised them. Our conclusion is that, as the trial court found,\ndefendant demonstrated some prejudice, sufficient to require justification by the\nprosecution for the delay, but the demonstrated prejudice was, on the whole, minimal.\n              i. The Arizona license plate number\n       Defendant first claims prejudice from the loss of the Arizona license plate number\nof the car in which Mr. Stevens saw defendant a few days before the murders.\nMr. Stevens made a note of the license plate number, but by the time defendant was\narrested, he could no longer find it. Defendant asserts the license plate number would\nhave “exonerated” him, or “at the very least would have confirmed he had no connection\nwith the station wagon the Stevenses described.” That is pure speculation. (See People\nv. Morris (1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 38 [finding no abuse of discretion where, among other\nthings, the defendant’s “claim that his own memory had faded was speculative at best”],\ndisapproved on another point in In re Sassounian (1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 543, fn. 5; People\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\fv. Hartman (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 572, 579 (Hartman) [“A defendant must show actual\nprejudice based on the facts of the case.”].)16\n              ii. Defendant’s alibi evidence and the Stevenses’ memories\n       Defendant contends if the investigators had interviewed the Stevenses in 1988,\n“there would have been fewer influences distorting the Stevenses’ memories, and\n[defendant] would have been in a position to present an alibi.” He says that by the time\nof the trial, the Stevenses could not pinpoint the date they saw him parked in front of their\nhouse, and defendant’s “1988 day-timers and personal notes were lost, depriving him of\nhis opportunity to prove alibi.” Similarly, defendant could have established his alibi by\nproducing credit card and financial receipts, but by the time he was charged, these\ndocuments had already been destroyed in the normal course of business. Defendant says\nthese records would also have demonstrated a consistent spending pattern during the\nweeks prior to and after the murders.\n       This lost evidence too is speculative. As for the Stevenses’ memories, defendant\nhad a full opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses on this point and did so; their\n“distort[ed]” memories were fully explored at trial and any prejudice could at most be\n\n16      The Hartman case illustrates a showing of “actual prejudice based on the facts of\nthe case.” (Hartman, supra, 170 Cal.App.3d at p. 579.) There, the medical examiner at\nthe original autopsy found death by natural causes. A year later, an independent\npathologist concluded the death stemmed from a homicide, although the actual cause of\ndeath could not be determined, and the several experts hired by the victim’s widow\nexpressed new but conflicting interpretations of the cause of death. Finally, “six years\nafter the second autopsy . . . and without the discovery of any new or additional evidence\nsince then,” the defendant was charged with murder. By then, both the medical examiner\nand the supervisor who supported his finding had died, and were thus unable to explain\nthe medical examiner’s findings at trial, or to rebut the implication by other witnesses\nthat he had been negligent. In addition, the victim’s brain had been misplaced after the\ninitial autopsy, and the heart had disappeared after the second autopsy, making it\nimpossible to resolve the medical inconsistencies among the experts at trial. The court\nfound actual, substantial prejudice to the defendant, and the five-and a-half-year delay in\nprosecution after the new expert evidence became available “was without any\njustification whatever.” (Id. at p. 583.) As will become apparent, this is not a\ncomparable case, in terms of either prejudice or justification.\n\n\n                                             62\n\fminimal. And with respect to the lost alibi evidence – daytimers, personal notes, credit\ncard receipts and so on – defendant had every incentive to preserve that information. As\nhe told the trial court below, he “was a named suspect within hours of the murder.” (See\nCowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 432 [rejecting the defendant’s argument that, 10 years\nlater, he could not identify alibi witnesses or recall what he was doing during the first few\nweeks of September 1984; “defendant was aware by at least February 1985 . . . that he\nwas a suspect in the . . . murders”; he “therefore had an incentive to record any\nexculpatory information he had regarding his whereabouts, . . . or the identity of alibi\nwitnesses”].)\n                iii. Information about improper influences on Detective Griggs’s\n                     investigation\n\n       Defendant contends that Mr. Thompson’s sister, Collene Campbell, improperly\ninfluenced and interfered with Detective Griggs’s investigation of other viable suspects,\nfrom the time of the murders until the detective retired in 1992. By the time defendant\nlearned of this alleged interference, most of the information in Detective Griggs’s\npersonnel file had been destroyed (further to the internal policy of the Los Angeles\nCounty Employees Retirement Association (LACERA)), and Detective Griggs was\nuncooperative. Once again, defendant only speculates that the file contained relevant\ndocuments, the destruction of which was “extremely prejudicial” to him. In any event,\ndefendant did not make this claim in his motion to the trial court, and cannot do so for the\nfirst time on appeal. (People v. Accredited Surety & Casualty Co. (2004) 132\nCal.App.4th 1134, 1146 [appellant is precluded from raising a new theory for the first\ntime in its appeal].)\n                iv. Telephone records\n       Kathy Weese and Joel Weissler testified about threats defendant made over the\ntelephone, including when Mr. Thompson called defendant’s office. By the time\ndefendant was charged, the telephone companies had purged records, so that the defense\ncould not obtain telephone records for the homes and offices of defendant,\nMr. Thompson and Mr. Weissler. Again, we have only speculation; there is no reason to\n\n                                             63\n\fassume these telephone records would have contradicted, rather than substantiated, the\nwitnesses’ testimony. “To avoid murder charges due to delay, the defendant must\naffirmatively show prejudice.” (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1250.)\n               v. John Williams’s testimony about towing defendant’s Mercedes\n       Mr. Williams testified to defendant’s threats on Mr. Thompson’s life that occurred\nwhen Mr. Williams seized defendant’s Mercedes to collect on Mr. Thompson’s\njudgment. The documentation, including Mr. Williams’s notes of the altercation, were\npurged, so defendant could not impeach Mr. Williams with his own notes (to establish\nthat the incident occurred in 1986, rather than shortly before the murders in 1988, and to\nestablish that no altercation was noted). But defendant was able to produce other,\nundisputed evidence that the towing occurred in 1986 (a receipt from the towing\ncompany and other documentation). Mr. Williams was thoroughly cross-examined and\nimpeached with the documents on the issue of when the levy occurred, so the purged\nnotes would have been cumulative – and defendant’s claim that those notes did not\nmention an altercation is complete speculation. So any prejudice from loss of the notes\nwas minimal.\n               vi. Lawyers’ records\n       Fee details and records kept by Mr. Thompson’s lawyers and lawyers for the\nbankruptcy estate were no longer available by the time defendant was charged. These\nrecords allegedly would have shown whether or not the meeting Mr. Coyne testified to,\nduring which defendant threatened Mr. Coyne, actually took place and whether defendant\nwas present. The fee details about phone calls “could have been used to impeach the\nwitnesses who testified about outbursts heard after calls they assumed to be between\nGoodwin and his own or Thompson’s attorneys.” Once again, defendant offers no reason\nto assume these records would contradict, rather than substantiate, the witnesses’\ntestimony.\n               vii. Locksmith records\n       Detective Jansen testified that to the best of his recollection, the damages to the\nsafe in the Thompsons’ garage, mentioned in his notes, was created by the locksmith\n\n                                             64\n\fwhen he opened the safe, rather than pointed out by the locksmith before he opened the\nsafe. By the time of trial, defendant was unable to impeach Detective Jansen with the\nlocksmith’s records – which “presumably . . . would have noted the date of service and\nany damage the company had caused to a private individual’s safe.” This, too, is only\nspeculation – both as to whether and how long any such records are kept and as to what\nthey would have shown – not an affirmative showing of prejudice.\n                    viii. Allison Triarsi’s diary\n       At the preliminary hearing in 2004, Miss Triarsi, the only eyewitness to the\nkillings, testified that she kept a journal when she was very young “and wrote down the\nspecific events which I ended up showing to a psychiatrist where I documented what I\nhad seen.” She said she had not located her journal when she first talked to Detective\nLillienfeld in 1997, but had located it later, “I don’t know, five years ago.” She said her\njournal “gave me the evidence in my mind that these are the things that I saw.” She\ntestified the journal was at her parents’ home, and the defense subpoenaed the diary after\nthe preliminary hearing, but her mother told the defense she did not have it and had not\nseen it in years.\n       Defendant contends the loss of the diary was “extremely prejudicial,” as the diary\n“likely effectively superseded her memory of the events themselves”; because of the\nprosecutor’s delay, defendant was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Miss\nTriarsi using the diary, which “was crucial to his defense.”17 Defendant fails to identify\nany respect in which the diary might have been “crucial to his defense.” At trial,\ndefendant’s counsel elicited that Miss Triarsi told Detective Lillienfeld in 1997 that “one\nor the other of the killers could have been white,” whereas at trial she testified she did not\nknow the race of the gunmen.\n       Again, any prejudice from loss of the diary appears quite speculative. The race of\nthe killers was established with the testimony of other witnesses. Defendant relies on\n\n17     Defendant also claims that records from Miss Triarsi’s school counselor were\nunavailable, and “might have shown Allison to be fantasizing,” but his citations to the\nrecord do not show any attempt in the trial court to obtain these records.\n\n                                                    65\n\fRoss v. United States (D.C. Cir. 1965) 349 F.2d 210, 213-214 (Ross), where the court\nfound a delay in prosecution prejudicial. There, the sole witness to a drug transaction\nwas the undercover drug purchaser, who had no personal recollection of the transaction\nand testified based entirely on his notebook recording his drug transactions. The court\nfound a purposeful seven-month delay between offense and arrest, a plausible claim by\nthe defendant of inability to recall or reconstruct the events on the day of the offense, and\na trial in which the entire case consisted of one witness’s recollection refreshed by his\nnotebook. (Id. at pp. 212, 215.) That is nothing like this case, where Miss Triarsi had an\nindependent memory of the shooting, and others testified to hearing the same screams\nfrom the victims and to seeing the shooters as they escaped. (Cf. Harrison v. United\nStates (D.C. 1987) 528 A.2d 1238, 1240-1241 [observing that precedential value of Ross\nwas questionable in view of more recent authority].) In short, again there is only\nspeculation that the diary might have contained something with which to impeach Miss\nTriarsi’s eyewitness account of the murders.\n              ix. Evidence of Mickey Thompson’s gold purchase\n       According to the investigative notes of Detective Rene Laporte, Eric Miller, a\nfriend of Mickey Thompson’s, told police that the night before the murders, he heard\nMickey Thompson say he had taken possession of $250,000 in gold. (The jury was told\n“a valuable item” in “a specific dollar amount,” rather than $250,000 in gold.) According\nto counsel, federal law at the time required registration of such an acquisition with the\nInternal Revenue Service, but those records were purged in 1995 and unavailable to the\ndefense. Defendant argues that if he had been prosecuted in a timely fashion, he would\nhave had an opportunity to prove, in connection with his theory the murders occurred\nduring a robbery, that Mr. Thompson purchased gold and it was unaccounted for after the\nmurders.\n       This lost evidence might conceivably have been relevant. But there was no basis\nto believe that any gold Mr. Thompson might have purchased had been delivered to his\nresidence, no suggestion how the shooters would have found out about Mr. Thompson’s\ngold purchase, and no evidence of forced entry into the Thompson residence. So, while\n\n                                             66\n\fthe possible evidence of a gold purchase may have been relevant, the prejudice arising\nfrom its absence appears minimal.\n              x. Unavailability of witnesses\n       Defendant identifies several witnesses, dead or otherwise unavailable by the time\nof trial, who might have provided relevant evidence, as follows.\n                     A. Unidentified people involved in the Joey Hunter investigation\n       A man named Joey Hunter was seen by several witnesses “hitchhiking frantically\nwith a bicycle at a bus stop,” about two and a half miles from the crime scene and less\nthan an hour after the murders. The original investigators followed up and arrested\nMr. Hunter, who failed polygraph tests regarding his involvement in the Thompson\nmurders. Defendant says Joey Hunter “suddenly and inexplicably ceased to be a\nsuspect,” and by the time of defendant’s prosecution, “people who were involved in the\nJoey Hunter investigation had died.” (The Joey Hunter evidence was proffered by the\ndefense (and excluded by the trial court) to establish that someone other than defendant\narranged the murders (see pt. 9, post).)\n       This contention was not raised in the trial court, and therefore cannot be raised on\nappeal. In any event, defendant does not specify the nature of the testimony these\nunidentified individuals would have given if they had been available as witnesses, instead\nmerely asking us to assume that an investigative decision not to pursue Mr. Hunter as a\nsuspect was based on something other than lack of evidence. This is unvarnished\nspeculation, and does not show prejudice.\n                     B. Yacht broker William Redfield\n       Mr. Redfield assisted defendant’s wife in her search for a yacht and, according to\ndefendant, would have testified she began searching months before the murders, and was\nexpecting a distribution of JGA/Whitehawk funds that would cover all her expenses.\nMr. Redfield would also have testified to the structure of the payments for the deposit on\nthe boat, thereby explaining the prosecution’s attempt to allege that $20,000 was not\naccounted for. (Defendant provides no citation to the record for this last point, but\napparently is referring to testimony from Karen Stephens-Kingdon, who testified about\n\n                                             67\n\fMs. Goodwin’s withdrawal of $20,000 from her account on March 16, 1988;\nMs. Kingdon-Stephens could not trace this money, and testified it was likely a cashier’s\ncheck or cash. Defendant pointed out that the yacht deposit consisted of checks for\n$11,000 and $20,000.)\n       This testimony is again hypothetical, but assuming its substance, it would have\nbeen relevant to the defense. Its absence, however, appears only marginally prejudicial.\nThe parties stipulated to testimony from a bank employee that a letter from Diane\nGoodwin dated December 24, 1987, months before the murders, stated she was in the\nprocess of deciding which yacht she was interested in purchasing. And the point about\nexpected distribution of JGA/Whitehawk funds to cover the yacht purchase has little\nsignificance, as the point of Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony was that the\nJGA/Whitehawk investment was funded by assets belonging to defendant and\nMs. Goodwin, not Ms. Goodwin alone. So overall, any prejudice was not substantial.\n                     C. Sable Reeves, the Thompsons’ housekeeper\n       According to defendant, witnesses testified the Thompsons left for work together\nevery morning. (Defendant does not cite this testimony, and we have not found it,\neither.) Ms. Reeves, however, told police the Thompsons rarely drove in the same car to\nwork together, Trudy Thompson was often at home alone when she arrived, and\nMr. Thompson usually had already gone to work by 6:00 a.m. Ms. Reeves would also\nhave been able to testify about whether valuables were missing.\n       We consider this testimony inconsequential. Even if Mr. Thompson typically left\nfor work earlier than he did on the day of the murders, there is nothing to show the killers\nwere not lying in wait at that earlier time. Nor is there anything to contradict the\nprosecution argument that the timing of the shooting was inconsistent with a typical\nresidential burglary, where the perpetrators tend to choose times when the residents are\nlikely to be absent. And hypothetical testimony about “whether valuables were missing”\nis completely speculative.\n\n\n\n\n                                             68\n\f                     D. Tom Villelli\n       Mr. Villelli was Baron Wehinger’s stepfather. Mr. Wehinger testified, for the first\ntime at trial, that Mr. Villelli and defendant discussed the price of hit men in 1984. In his\npreliminary hearing testimony, Mr. Wehinger did not mention the discussion of the price\nof hit men; he simply testified that he overheard defendant saying that “he would have\nMickey Thompson taken care of if he lost his court battles with him.” He also said this\noccurred two or three months before the murders, but then on cross-examination, when\nasked if the conversation occurred in 1987, said “I believe so,” and then when asked, “Or\n’86?” Mr. Wehinger answered, “’86, it had to be earlier, yeah.”\n       Defendant says that “Wehinger never indicated before trial the conversation had\noccurred in 1984 and [defendant] and Villelli discussed the price of hit men.” Defendant\nsays he was prepared to impeach Mr. Wehinger on his preliminary hearing testimony,\nbecause defendant was in the Bahamas during Christmas of 1987, but “by the time the\ndefense became aware Wehinger was claiming Villelli had discussed hit men with\n[defendant], Villelli was very near death and unable to testify to rebut this claim.”\n       Again, this is hypothetical testimony; we do not know whether Mr. Villelli would\nhave rebutted or substantiated Mr. Wehinger’s testimony. If we assume Mr. Villelli\nwould have contradicted Mr. Wehinger, the loss of this testimony would prejudice\ndefendant. But, after Mr. Wehinger’s uncertainty at the preliminary hearing as to when\nthe conversation occurred, defendant certainly could not count on impeaching\nMr. Wehinger at trial with his Bahamas alibi for Christmas of 1987. So after the\npreliminary hearing in 2004, defendant had every incentive to interview Mr. Villelli, both\nabout the date and the nature of the conversation, and apparently failed to do so. Given\nthe speculative nature of Mr. Villelli’s lost testimony, and the other extensive evidence of\ndefendant’s threats (such as Gregory Keay’s testimony that defendant said “he would\nhave [Mr. Thompson] wasted”), defendant was not unduly prejudiced by Mr. Villelli’s\nunavailability.\n\n\n\n\n                                             69\n\f                     E. Gregory Keay’s mother (defendant’s aunt)\n       As just noted, Gregory Keay testified to a threat defendant made at a family\ngathering two or three months before the murders, to have Mickey Thompson “wasted.”\nDorothy Keay “could have testified to the date the gathering occurred, her son’s lack of\ncredibility and his bias against [defendant].” Again, this is nothing more than\nspeculation, not an affirmative showing of prejudice\n                     F. Charles Clayton\n       Mr. Clayton was defendant’s friend and financial advisor and, defendant says,\n“would have testified [defendant] always intended to pay the Thompson judgment . . . .”\nMr. Clayton also structured the yacht purchase and could have testified to the\ncircumstances surrounding the purchase and the couple’s plans to live on the\nJGA/Whitehawk distributions.\n       Defendant does not tell us when Mr. Clayton died or why the information he had\nabout the yacht purchase would not be available from other sources. Moreover, his\ntestimony about defendant’s intent to pay off the Thompson judgment based on any\nfinancial planning the two may have done together would be inconsequential, in light of\nthe evidence from Dolores Cordell that defendant did indeed repeatedly express his\nwillingness to accept settlement terms, only to renege at the last minute. Accordingly,\nany prejudice defendant suffered from the unavailability of Mr. Clayton’s testimony was\nminimal.\n                     G. Anne Clark\n       Ms. Clark was a close friend of the Thompsons. After the murders, on\nFebruary 15, 1989, she called into a television show that solicited tips about the murder.\nThe “clue sheet” stated she “want[ed] to know why they didn’t mention the drug deal.\nMickey’s sister [Collene] knew about a drug deal. [Mickey Thompson] had asked\n[Ms. Clark] to give him one million dollars. She does not know what for. Sheriff took\nover call.” (The clue sheet also says, “cleared” and “no new info.”) Detective Lillienfeld\ninterviewed Ms. Clark in May 2002, and the report of the interview did not mention the\n\n\n\n                                            70\n\fcall to the tip line. When defendant sought to interview Ms. Clark, “her dementia was so\nadvanced she no longer recognized anyone.”\n       We fail to see any basis to conclude Ms. Clark had any information helpful to the\ndefense; no prejudice was shown.\n                     H. Frank Gullett\n       According to defendant, Joey Hunter confessed his involvement in the murders to\nFrank Gullet, while they were both in jail after Mr. Hunter’s arrest in late April 1988,\nwhen Mr. Hunter was a suspect in the murders. (Defendant does not cite to it, but we\nfound in the record a search warrant affidavit that recounts a police interview with Frank\nGullet, in which Mr. Gullet said that he asked Mr. Hunter if he was actually involved in\nthe murders and Mr. Hunter stated, “ ‘Yes, but they can’t prove it . . . .’ ”) If he had been\nalive at the time of trial, defendant says, Mr. Gullet “could have provided valuable\ntestimony about Hunter’s confession that would have supported [defendant’s] attempt to\npresent third party culpability evidence to the jury and impeached the investigation.”\n       Defendant does not say what this “valuable testimony about Hunter’s confession”\nwas, or how it would support his attempt to present third party culpability evidence. (The\ntrial court properly excluded defendant’s third party culpability evidence (as we discuss\nin pt. 9, post), and indicated that “there is no evidence that Joey Hunter has any\nconnection with this case.”) Defendant has not shown prejudice from the loss of\nMr. Gullet’s testimony.\n              xi. Memory loss of trial witnesses\n       Defendant cites the trial testimony of 12 witnesses who he contends “suffered\nmemory distortion and loss prejudicial to defendant,” forgetting details, including\nspecific words defendant spoke and dates threats were allegedly made. These were as\nfollows:\n       Dale Newman could not recall the exact words of the threat he overheard, and a\npolice report was used to refresh his recollection. (Defendant tried to impeach his\ntestimony that the threat occurred in the fall of 1987 by showing him a police report\nstating he said it happened in July 1986, but Mr. Newman insisted that he “certainly did\n\n                                             71\n\fnot” say that, and “[t]hat would have to be a typo on [the detective’s] part or whatever,”\nand “[r]egardless it was not correct.”)\n       Bill Wilson could not remember to whom he spoke when he first called the police\nwith information about the murders, and could not remember when defendant and\nMr. Thompson became business partners. Nina Wilson could not remember the precise\ndate of the dinner party at which defendant threatened Mickey Thompson, or why they\nhad invited the Goodwins, or whether Detective Lillienfeld was the first detective she\nspoke to about the case.\n       Karen Dragutin could not remember which detective she spoke to in 1989, or\ndetails concerning television broadcasts about the murder and rewards offered, or the date\nor other details of the dinner at which she heard defendant threaten Mickey Thompson.\n       Baron Wehinger and Gregory Keay could not recall the dates of the threats they\nheard, so defendant could not investigate or impeach them and could not establish his\nwhereabouts or find witnesses to testify the conversations never occurred.\n       Dolores Cordell, Jeffrey Coyne, and Karen Stephens-Kingdon all said “I don’t\nrecall” to various questions, the materiality of which defendant does not explain; he\nmerely claims their failure to recall “would not have withstood scrutiny had the case been\nbrought in 1989 or 1990.” (Defendant’s assertion that the prosecutors presented expert\nopinion on his financial wrongdoing “without regard to the facts” and “knew the original\ndocuments supplying the basis for these opinions were lost or destroyed years ago” is\nentirely unsupported by the record.)\n       Penn Weldon could not remember precisely when his conversation with defendant\noccurred, and he no longer had his appointment book.\n       Defendant also asserts that the passage of time and outside influences “no doubt”\naffected Allison Triarsi’s memory of the incident, and that Detective Griggs could not\nrecall the details of interviews that would have contradicted prosecution witnesses,\n“including [Detectives] Verdugo and Jansen,” and was unable to authenticate his notes.\nAs to Detective Griggs, defendant provides no information about or citations to the\nrecord explaining these asserted contradictions, and merely complains that Detective\n\n                                            72\n\fGriggs did not recall entering the Thompson home to determine whether personal\nproperty was missing, and that Detective Verdugo was permitted to testify no property\nwas missing despite the absence of his original notes on that issue.\n       Many of the memory lapses just described were inconsequential. All of them are\nspeculative, in the sense that we are asked to assume that had memories been sharper, the\ntestimony would have been more favorable – rather than more damning – to defendant.\nThis falls far short of the affirmative showing of prejudice necessary to avoid murder\ncharges. (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1250.)\n       In sum, for the reasons we have given, we cannot characterize the loss of\nwitnesses, and the loss of evidence due to fading memory, in this case as more than\nminimally prejudicial to the defense. Almost all of the lost evidence or testimony\ndefendant cites demonstrates only the potential for prejudice, rather than actual prejudice,\nand the trial court correctly concluded that it would be improper simply to assume the\ncited evidence would have been favorable to defendant.\n       d. The justification for the delay\n       The prosecutor’s justification for the delay, certainly in the abstract, is strong. The\nstate did not amass the necessary evidence for a successful prosecution until 2001, when\nthe police learned that Ronald and Tonyia Stevens had seen defendant in the\nneighborhood with binoculars a few days before the murders. In the end, the question\nwhether the 13-year delay in prosecution violated defendant’s due process rights turns on\nwhether there was malfeasance or negligence in the state’s failure to obtain that evidence\nsooner. As Cowan tells us, a weak showing of prejudice would tip the scales toward a\ndue process violation if the delay was purposeful, but “[i]f the delay was merely\nnegligent,” a greater showing of prejudice would be required to establish a violation.\n(Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 431.)\n       Here, the trial court concluded that it could not “fault anyone for the fact that it\ntook so long to actually get enough evidence to file the case.” Defendant contends\notherwise, saying that the prosecution had “constructive knowledge” of the Stevenses’\n\n\n\n                                              73\n\finformation in 1988. This is because the Stevenses called the police several times, telling\nthem they had possible information about the murders. Specifically:\n       On the day the Stevenses saw the car parked outside their home, Tonyia Stevens\ncalled the Temple City Sheriff’s Department and reported a suspicious looking car,\ntelling the police “ ‘I just want you to know in case anything happens that we have\ninformation.’ ” A couple of weeks after the murders, a uniformed policeman at a\nroadblock stopped Tonyia Stevens and asked her if she had any information. She\ntestified: “And I said, ‘yes, I do’ and I told him. He says, ‘Have you told the police?’\nand I said, ‘Yes.’ He says ‘Okay, go on then.’ ” Ronald Stevens said he tried to report\nthe incident to the police, “either three or four times, not long after the murder.” After\ntalking to a friend, he called the Duarte Sheriff’s Department, at about 9:00 p.m., and told\nthe person who answered the phone that he thought he had some information on the\nThompson murder. Mr. Stevens was told a detective would call him, but no one did. A\ncouple of weeks later, Mr. Stevens called the Temple City Sheriff’s Department “and left\nanother message. Same thing.” In addition, Mr. Stevens said: “I think there was one or\ntwo other times that I called because I just, you know, tried to call someone. But I don’t\nremember the dates or times.”\n       Despite these efforts by the Stevenses in 1988 to report their information, no\ninvestigator contacted Mr. Stevens about the incident until 2001. Defendant contends the\ninformation was not “new” in 2001; “investigators had it in 1988 and ignored it”; and the\ninformation “is imputed to the prosecution,” citing Kyles, supra, 514 U.S. at page 438.\nKyles is inapposite. There, the court was discussing exculpatory evidence withheld by\nthe government, and stated the well-established proposition that, under Brady, “the\nindividual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others\nacting on the government’s behalf in the case, including the police.” (Kyles, at p. 437.)\nHere, we do not have a Brady question of disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Moreover,\nthe police did not in fact obtain the Stevenses’ information until 2001, so it can hardly be\n“imputed to the prosecution” as of 1988.\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\f       We do not know how or why the Stevenses messages to the police went astray, but\nthey did. This is certainly not “malfeasance.” It was an error, but we cannot necessarily\ncharacterize it as negligence. This was not a situation where the investigators received\ninformation that the Stevenses saw defendant at the scene, or had the license plate\nnumber of a suspicious vehicle, and then failed to follow up. Instead, unidentified police\npersonnel apparently did not pass on telephone messages about information possibly\nrelating to the murders. In a more perfect world, the investigators would have had the\ninformation sooner, but in fact they did not. So in the absence of a showing of prejudice\nconsiderably more significant than we have seen, the justification for the delay in\nprosecution – that the police did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute defendant until\n2001 – plainly outweighs the prejudice. (See Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 436 [finding\nno evidence of negligence; “[r]ather, at worst the . . . Sheriff’s Department simply erred\nwhen it failed to determine before 1994 that defendant’s fingerprints matched the [crime]\nscene latent prints”].)\n       Defendant’s other attacks on the investigation fare no better. He asserts that\n“discovery and testimony at trial indicate investigators did nothing during the periods\n1990 through 1992, 1992 through 1995, and 1996 through 1997.” But he cites nothing in\nthe record to support this assertion, other than defense counsel’s own argument to the\ntrial court. And Detective Lillienfeld testified that Sergeant Yarborough of the cold case\nunit had the lead on the investigation after Detective Griggs retired. (See Cowan, supra,\n50 Cal.4th at pp. 428, 436 [no active investigation from 1987 to 1994; court rejected\ndefendant’s claim the investigation was dormant during that period, as there was\ntestimony that the supervisor of the unit was responsible for the case after the assigned\ndetective left in 1987; “we will not second-guess the department’s decision to allocate its\nresources in this manner”].)\n       Defendant also claims – citing only counsel’s affidavit “on information and belief”\nseeking discovery of Detective Griggs’s personnel file – that Detective Griggs did not\nfocus on leads he should have followed. But counsel’s declaration is not evidence of\nmalfeasance or negligence. Nor is defendant’s assertion that in 1988, four detectives\n\n                                            75\n\fwere re-assigned to other matters due to staffing requirements. (See Nelson, supra, 43\nCal.4th at p. 1256 [“[a] court may not find negligence by second-guessing how the state\nallocates its resources”].)18\n       Finally, defendant also argues that Gail Moreau-Hunter’s information – that\ndefendant had in effect confessed his responsibility for the murders – was not “new” in\n1999, when Detective Lillienfeld located and interviewed her; that Ms. Moreau-Hunter\n“confirmed an interview” in January 1993 (the nature of which is not specified in\ndefendant’s brief or in the record); and that in any event Ms. Moreau-Hunter was\n“delusional.” We need not linger long on these points, since Ms. Moreau-Hunter did not\ntestify at trial, and it was the Stevenses’ evidence that enabled the prosecutors to file the\ncase. In any event, there is no evidence of police negligence in respect of Ms. Moreau-\nHunter’s testimony and, in the absence of any evidence of negligence or malfeasance, we\nwill not second-guess the conduct of the investigation (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\np. 1256) based on speculation that somehow the police could have elicited the\ninformation from Ms. Moreau-Hunter earlier. The fact is, as the Court of Appeal in\nOrange County pointed out, these were new developments in the case.\n\n\n\n\n18     Defendant also characterizes Detective Lillienfeld’s investigation as “grossly\nnegligent.” The investigative files he reviewed from 1988 contained an Arizona license\nplate number for a car which, defense counsel told the trial court, was parked in the\ndriveway of a drug dealer (seven miles from the Thompson home) associated with Joey\nHunter (who was then being investigated in connection with the murders). Defendant\ncomplains that, after the Stevenses told him the car in front of their house had an Arizona\nlicense plate, Detective Lillienfeld did not try to determine the make and model of the car\nthat had been parked in the drug dealer’s driveway. We fail to see the significance of this\nclaim, as Joey Hunter had long since been abandoned as a suspect. To the extent\ndefendant’s claim is that Joey Hunter should have continued to be a suspect, there is no\nbasis to suggest that is so. (See Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1256 [“A court may not\nfind negligence by second-guessing . . . how law enforcement agencies could have\ninvestigated a given case.”].) And Detective Lillienfeld did attempt to trace the vehicle\nparked outside the Stevenses home, but could not find a vehicle that matched the best\ndescription he had (a 1973 Chevrolet Malibu nine-passenger station wagon).\n\n\n                                              76\n\f       e. Summary\n       While most of defendant’s claimed losses of evidence are speculative, we cannot\ndefinitively say that the passage of time resulted in no prejudice to defendant. But “[t]o\navoid murder charges due to delay, the defendant must affirmatively show prejudice.”\n(Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1250.) Defendant’s affirmative showing of prejudice was\nminimal. And we can definitively say – despite defendant’s claims the delay in\nprosecution was “intentional” and “the real purpose . . . was to weaken [defendant’s]\nability to defend himself” – that there is not the slightest evidence of a deliberate delay to\ngain a tactical advantage. (See id. at p. 1256 [“ ‘Investigative delay is fundamentally\nunlike delay undertaken by the government solely to gain tactical advantage over an\naccused because investigative delay is not so one-sided. A prosecutor abides by\nelementary standards of fair play and decency by refusing to seek indictments until he or\nshe is completely satisfied the defendant should be prosecuted and the office of the\nprosecutor will be able to promptly establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’ ”].)\n       There is no doubt that 13 years is a long prearrest delay, but it was not a\npurposeful one. The bottom line is that the prosecutors concluded they did not have\nenough evidence to convict defendant until 2001. This is a strong justification for the\nprearrest delay. Errors in an investigation do not always amount to negligence, and they\ndid not here. “It is not enough for a defendant to argue that if the prosecutorial agencies\nhad made his or her case a higher priority or had done things a bit differently they would\nhave solved the case sooner.” (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1256-1257.)\n       The court’s summary in Cowan is apt in this case: “[T]he investigation of the . . .\nmurders was not perfect; no investigation is. Like the trial court, however, we find no\nevidence that law enforcement or the prosecution deliberately delayed the investigation in\norder to gain a tactical advantage over defendant. Nor do we find evidence of\nnegligence. Rather, at worst the . . . Sheriff’s Department simply erred . . . . That being\nthe case, balancing defendant’s weak showing of prejudice against the strong justification\nfor the delay [citation], we find no due process violation. Accordingly, the trial court did\n\n\n\n                                              77\n\fnot abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s . . . motion[] to dismiss due to\nprearrest delay.” (Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 436.)\n4. The Pitchess/Brady issue\n       Before the trial, defendant filed several motions seeking information from\nDetective Griggs’s personnel file, under Pitchess, supra, 11 Cal.3d 531 and Brady, supra,\n373 U.S. 83.\n       Under Pitchess procedures, on a showing of good cause, a criminal defendant is\nentitled to material information contained in confidential personnel records of a police\nofficer. If good cause is shown, the trial court must review the requested records in\ncamera to determine what information, if any, should be disclosed. (People v. Mooc\n(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1226 (Mooc).) Under Brady, the prosecution is required to\ndisclose favorable evidence to the defense.\n       Here, the defense sought material from Detective Griggs’s personnel files,\nparticularly information relating to his disability retirement, psychiatric evaluations and\nthe like, as well as any other exculpatory or impeaching material within the meaning of\nBrady. The defense theory was that Detective Griggs was incapable of conducting a fair,\ncompetent and unbiased investigation; that his deficient investigation ignored other viable\nleads and suspects, particularly Joey Hunter; that there were complaints from Collene\nCampbell about his job performance; that all this led to a stress-related early retirement,\nand the disability he claimed substantially affected his judgment and credibility. The\ndefense sought personnel files from both the sheriff’s department and LACERA for the\nretired detective.\n       We need not describe the multiple motions and arguments on the Pitchess and\nBrady theories relating to discovery of Detective Griggs’s personnel file. In the end, on\nMay 23, 2006, the trial court ordered the sheriff’s department and LACERA to produce\nany documents in the personnel files referring to the Mickey Thompson investigation for\nin camera review. Counsel for LACERA had brought LACERA’s records, and left them\nwith the court for in camera review, with a hearing scheduled for June 7, 2006.\n\n\n\n                                              78\n\f(LACERA had destroyed all its files except for those relied on in granting Detective\nGriggs’s disability retirement.)\n       On June 7, 2006, the court announced it had reviewed the entire file from\nLACERA, “and paper clipped and put post-its on the portions that I feel should be\ndisclosed.” That package was identified as “Court’s Exhibit 1, LACERA\nPitchess/Brady,” and preserved for appellate review.\n       Also on June 7, 2006, the court briefly reviewed the personnel file materials\nprovided by the sheriff’s department, and observed it appeared there was nothing to be\ndisclosed. But, to be certain, the court directed the custodian and her counsel to cull the\nfile to eliminate material pertaining to the period before the murders, and to return with\nthe remaining material for the court’s in camera review. On June 16, 2006, the sheriff’s\ndepartment brought the personnel records for the period March 16, 1988, to March 23,\n1993, and the court ordered certain of the documents disclosed to the defense, staying its\norder until June 29, 2006, to permit the sheriff’s department to decide whether to seek\nwrit review. Apparently no writ was sought.\n       The parties agree that this court should independently review the sealed transcripts\nof the hearings and related sealed personnel files, to ascertain whether the trial court\nproperly exercised its discretion in identifying discoverable information. We have\nreviewed the sealed transcript of the in camera hearing at which the trial court described,\non the record, the items in Detective Griggs’s personnel file produced by the sheriff’s\ndepartment, and find no abuse of discretion. (See People v. Prince (2007) 40 Cal.4th\n1179, 1285-1286 [trial court directed that personnel file not be copied and inserted into\nthe record, “but the court adequately stated for the record the contents of that file,” citing\nMooc, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1229, for the principle that “in some circumstances it\nsuffices for the court to ‘state for the record what documents it examined’ ”].) We have\nlikewise reviewed the in camera transcript and the confidential documents produced by\nLACERA and preserved for appellate review, and again find no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              79\n\f5. Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s Expert Testimony\n       We have described Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony in part 7.a., ante, of the\nfacts. In a nutshell, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon looked at thousands of financial records to\ndetermine the source and ultimate disposition of certain assets and funds, and opined, for\nexample, that the yacht Diane Goodwin purchased in her own name was bought with\nfunds that had been commingled for years, and that “funds that were originally\ncommingled and invested end[ed] up going offshore or to purchase gold coins, cash or\ntraveler’s checks.”\n       On appeal, defendant contends Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony was\ninadmissible, principally because the testimony could not assist the jury in its fact finding\nand on relevance grounds. Defendant made the same arguments, unsuccessfully, at the\npreliminary hearing and when he moved under Penal Code section 995 to set aside the\ninformation after the preliminary hearing.19 None of them has merit.\n       An expert may offer an opinion on “a subject that is sufficiently beyond common\nexperience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.” (Evid. Code,\n§ 801, subd. (a); People v. Mayfield (1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 766.) An expert is qualified\nif he or she “ ‘has sufficient skill or experience in the field so that his [or her] testimony\n\n\n19     Respondent contends defendant did not object at trial to the expert’s testimony on\nthe ground she was not qualified as an expert, and therefore forfeited those objections on\nappeal. It is true that, in his brief reciting his objections at trial, defendant implies he\nobjected that Ms. Stephens-Kingdon “was not a qualified expert on the financial issues,”\nand defendant does not identify any such objection in the record. But his argument on\nappeal does not address Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s qualifications as an expert on financial\nissues; it is directed to the content or nature of her testimony. To the extent respondent is\ncontending that points raised in defendant’s unsuccessful motion to set aside the\ninformation must be explicitly raised again at trial but were not, the record is not so clear.\n(Defense counsel told the trial court, “I don’t think that necessarily means it required an\nexpert,” and “if they could prove it, then the jury could make up its own mind about what\nthose assets transfers mean.”) And the case on which respondent relies, People v.\nHawkins (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 194, 203-204, is not directly on point, holding only that\nan issue not raised in a Penal Code section 995 dismissal motion was not preserved for\nappeal. We will therefore address defendant’s claims on their merits.\n\n\n                                              80\n\fwould be likely to assist the jury in the search for the truth.’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nMayfield, at p. 766.) We review a trial court’s ruling permitting expert testimony for\nabuse of discretion. (Ibid.)\n        Defendant asserts the expert testimony was inadmissible because it “could not\nassist the jury in understanding the evidence and brought incompetent hearsay before the\njury.” According to defendant, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon “overstepped her ‘expert’ status,”\nbecause the Evidence Code does not “authorize[] a witness to review documents not\nbrought before the court and give an opinion regarding the defendant’s purpose for his or\nhis family member’s financial dealings,” or “to testify to the state of mind and intent of a\ndefendant based on his wife’s financial dealings.” The expert “did not assist the jury in\nits fact-finding,” because “she was in no better position than they were to evaluate the\nevidence concerning [defendant’s] ‘consciousness of guilt.’ ”\n        As we have seen, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon examined thousands of financial records\nand testified to the source and disposition of certain assets and funds. She did not testify\nto the defendant’s purpose or state of mind or intent as to those transactions. She opined\nthat assets originally purchased with commingled funds of both spouses were transferred\nto investments or purchases in the name of one spouse. This subject matter is sufficiently\nbeyond common experience that the opinion of a qualified accountant and auditor would\nassist the trier of fact.\n        Defendant insists the expert testified to defendant’s “state of mind and intent”\nbased on his wife’s financial dealings. To support his claim, defendant cites only the\nexpert’s testimony about the purchase of the yacht with commingled funds and contends\nthat this testimony “draw[s] conclusions regarding motive.” When asked if, as she had\ntestified, funds were commingled as of January 1988, “what does that tell you, if\nanything, about [defendant’s] interest in the boat transaction,” the witness replied, “What\nI saw was that even though this boat was in Diane Goodwin’s name, that it had been\npurchased with funds that had been commingled for so many years that this boat purchase\nwas for both Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin.” We reject the notion that the quoted testimony\nwas tantamount to an opinion on defendant’s motive, purpose, state of mind or intent. It\n\n                                             81\n\fwas simply a statement, consistent with the rest of the expert’s testimony, on the source\nand disposition of assets – not on why the transaction was undertaken.20\n       Defendant also argues the expert testimony “brought incompetent hearsay before\nthe jury,” and the expert “did not bring to court any of the documents she reviewed . . . or\nabout which she testified.” Because defendant does not elaborate on these claims, we\nneed not consider them. We do note, however, that the prosecutor questioned the witness\nwith specific reference to a limited number of documents (as defendant admits) that were\nidentified in court. And when the expert expressed opinions in reliance on specific\ndocuments, the trial court instructed the jury, during the testimony, that the “information\nreferred to now by the witness is being offered not for the truth of what it says but just to\nshow what the witness based her opinion on,” and “she’s explaining what her opinion is\nbased on, but you are not to assume that the letters state what she says they state for the\ntruth of the matter.” Further, it is well established that an expert may base an opinion on\nreliable hearsay. (People v. Harris (2013) 57 Cal.4th 804, 847 [“Expert testimony in the\nform of an opinion may be based on hearsay or facts outside the personal knowledge of\nthe expert.”]; see Evid. Code, § 801, subd. (b) [expert opinion may be “[b]ased on matter\n. . . made known to [the witness], whether or not admissible, that is of a type that\nreasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject to\nwhich his testimony relates”].)\n       Next, defendant argues the admission of Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony\nviolated Evidence Code section 1523, subdivision (d). Section 1523, subdivision (a)\n\n20      Defendant asserts, erroneously, that Kotla v. Regents of the University of\nCalifornia (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 283 is analogous to this case. In that employment\ntermination case, the trial court erred in permitting a management expert to offer opinion\ntestimony about whether certain facts were “indicators” of a retaliatory motive. (Id. at p.\n286.) The appellate court found the opinions “about the significance of the evidence did\nnot assist the jury in its factfinding process,” and that the expert “was in no better\nposition than they were to evaluate the evidence concerning retaliation. Absent unusual\nfacts, it must be presumed that jurors are capable of deciding a party’s motive for\nthemselves without being told by an expert which finding on that issue the evidence\nsupports.” (Id. at p. 293.) As we have observed, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon did not testify\nabout the motive for the financial transactions on which she opined.\n\n                                             82\n\fmakes oral testimony “to prove the content of a writing” inadmissible except as otherwise\nprovided by statute. Section 1523, subdivision (d) provides an exception “if the writing\nconsists of numerous accounts or other writings that cannot be examined in court without\ngreat loss of time, and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of the\nwhole.” Defendant cites no authority for his claim, and it has no merit. Section 1523 has\nnothing to do with expert testimony, and Ms. Stephens-Kingdon did not purport to testify\n“to prove the content of a writing.” She testified about the documents she relied on in\nforming her opinions, and there was nothing improper in that testimony.\n       Finally, defendant contends Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony was irrelevant,\nbecause “Diane[] [Goodwin’s] financial transactions did not show a consciousness of\nguilt on [defendant’s] part.” Defendant fails to identify in the record any objection made\nat trial on grounds of relevance. (Defendant did object on this ground to Ms. Stephens-\nKingdon’s testimony at the preliminary hearing. The prosecutor explained that the\ntestimony was relevant to the theory of “consciousness of guilt in the defendant\nattempting to flee the country,” and the court found that “potentially the People have a\nrelevant theory here.”) In any event, the testimony was relevant. As the prosecutor put it\nat trial, the ultimate opinion he sought to elicit was “what [defendant] and Diane\nGoodwin were doing financially from the period of 1986 to the spring of 1988.” And as\nthe trial court stated, the prosecutor sought to show defendant “was engaged in . . .\ntransferring of assets to avoid, I think the argument is, to avoid having to pay a\nsubstantial judgment, and this witness is competent to testify to whether or not she\nbelieves based on her review of these documents, whether or not that is what occurred.”\nThe claim of irrelevance is meritless.\n       Because there was no error in the admission of Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s\ntestimony, we need not consider defendant’s further contention that the error was\nprejudicial.\n6. The Admission of Nancy Lucia’s Testimony\n       Nancy Lucia (formerly Wilkinson) was permitted to testify to a statement Mickey\nThompson made in September or October 1987 while Ms. Lucia was visiting the\n\n                                             83\n\fThompson home (pt. 2.l. of the recitation of facts, ante). Mr. Thompson came upstairs,\nout of breath and frantic, “almost kind of yelling, saying ‘[c]lose the window. Close the\ndrapes. [Defendant] could have a sniper out there right now.”\n       We review the trial court’s ruling for abuse of discretion (People v. Guerra (2006)\n37 Cal.4th 1067, 1140 [“we apply an abuse of discretion standard of review to any ruling\nby a trial court on the admissibility of evidence”]), and find none.\n       a. The trial court’s ruling\n       The trial court concluded Mr. Thompson’s statement was not hearsay, because it\nwas not being offered for its truth, and it was relevant “on the issue of the level of\nhostility that existed in this litigation. [¶] It’s circumstantial evidence which would tend\nto corroborate the People’s argument and the People’s witnesses that this litigation was\nso vitriolic; this litigation was so intense and caused such animosity and hatred between\nthe parties, that Mr. Thompson truly believed that because of the litigation he was\ninvolved in with [defendant], that his life was in danger. That’s a non-hearsay purpose in\nmy mind.”21\n       The court elaborated: “[I]t is circumstantial evidence tending to corroborate the\nPeople’s description of what they believe the motive was in this case. It’s circumstantial\nevidence that the litigation got so out of hand and was so intense that there was a realistic\nbelief on the part of Mr. Thompson that his life was in danger. [¶] Now, the reason I say\nthat it’s circumstantial evidence to show all of that is because it’s not so important as to\n\n21      The court said that, if the statement were being offered for its truth, “it would\nclearly be hearsay. And then the court would have to find it is [an Evidence Code\nsection 1240 spontaneous] statement and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial\neffect, all of which I can easily find. [¶] However, it’s not being offered for the truth.”\nThen, after elaborating on the admissibility of the statement as circumstantial evidence\n“tending to show that because of the animosity generated and the vitriolic nature of this\nlawsuit that [defendant] had a motive to murder these two people,” the court said: “So\nmy analysis is, assuming it’s hearsay, it comes in under [section] 1240. Its probative\nvalue outweighs any prejudicial effect. However, I think the proper analysis would be\nthat this is a non-hearsay statement not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. And\nthe People can’t argue that it’s offered for the truth of the matter asserted.”\n\n\n                                              84\n\fwhat was said, if anything, by [defendant]. And I don’t think Mr. Thompson attributes\nthe statement to [defendant], but he is attributing a belief. And that belief has to be based\non some fact or facts. [¶] And it appears to me that given the testimony I have heard so\nfar, it’s not unreasonable to conclude that Mr. Thompson, as a party to this litigation, was\naware of and a participant in the goings-on between the sides. Therefore, he was aware\nof the fact that . . . the hatred generated by the litigation was rather intense. This\nstatement was allegedly made [in] early fall, late summer 1987. So it’s not that long\nbefore the murders. [¶] So for those reasons, I view it as a non-hearsay statement\ncoming in for the value that it brings or demonstrates in terms of the level of hostility\nbelieved to have existed by Mr. Thompson; not being offered for the truth.”\n       The court further ruled that the probative value of the testimony far outweighed its\nprejudicial effect: “It’s extremely probative. And the prejudicial effect, quite frankly, we\nhave heard nothing but statements from the People’s witnesses attributed to [defendant]\nthat he allegedly wants to kill Mr. Thompson. [¶] So the extent to which this is too\nprejudicial is nonexistent. It’s simply the same kind of evidence that we have heard from\njust about every witness that has testified so far. So I do believe under [Evidence Code\nsection] 352 the probative value is considerable. The prejudicial effect [is] minimal to\nnonexistent when taken in context with the other evidence. So I will allow it.”\n       Defense counsel asked about a limiting instruction, and the court replied, “I was\ngoing to simply tell the jury what I’m supposed to tell them, which is this statement is not\nbeing admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, that is that [defendant] has some sniper\nstanding outside the house. But it’s being admitted as circumstantial evidence tending to\nshow how the victim perceived the tenor of this lawsuit or this litigation.” There was no\nfurther discussion until after Ms. Lucia testified two days later.\n       The court did not admonish the jury when Ms. Lucia testified, and later in the day\ninquired whether counsel wanted the court “to admonish them now or would you just\nsimply like to include the admonition in a jury instruction?” After argument about the\ncontent of the admonition, defense counsel ultimately said: “Our request is that the\nadmonition be that it’s offered not for the truth of the statement, but for the state of mind\n\n                                              85\n\fof the declarant. Period. And if that’s not the admonition, then we are not requesting\none.” After more discussion, the court pointed out it would not admonish “that the\nPeople were offering it solely on the issue of the state of mind, because that would have\nbeen for the truth,” and reiterated that it had ruled that the statement was “circumstantial\nevidence corroborating the level of animosity that existed between the parties in this\nlitigation.” The defense then stated, “we’re not requesting the admonition,” and the court\nstated: “All right. I’m not going to say anything then. And I stand ready, willing and\nable to do so when requested.”\n       b. Defendant’s contentions\n       Defendant contends the court committed reversible error by admitting the\ntestimony, claiming it was “irrelevant and prejudicial hearsay.” We disagree.\n       Defendant argues at length that the trial court “erred by admitting evidence of\nThompson’s state of mind, offered under Evidence Code [section] 1250, because the\nevidence was irrelevant to [defendant’s] motive.”22 This claim simply misstates the trial\ncourt’s ruling, as well as the prosecutor’s theory of admissibility. The evidence was not\noffered to prove Mr. Thompson’s state of mind; the prosecutor explicitly said that\n“[w]e’re not offering it under [section] 1250. We are offering it to prove another factor,\nwhich is that this litigation was not one of conciliatory settlement.” And the trial court\nrefused defense counsel’s request to admonish the jury that the statement was being\noffered “on the issue of state of mind, because that would have been for the truth.” Thus\ndefendant’s extended discussion of whether and when a victim’s out-of-court statements\nexpressing fear of a defendant are admissible, under section 1250, to prove the\ndefendant’s motive is entirely inapposite.\n\n\n\n22      Evidence Code section 1250 provides that “evidence of a statement of the\ndeclarant’s then existing state of mind . . . is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule\nwhen: [¶] (1) The evidence is offered to prove the declarant’s state of mind . . . at that\ntime or at any other time when it is itself an issue in the action; or [¶] (2) The evidence\nis offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of the declarant.” (Id., subd. (a).)\n\n\n                                             86\n\f       Defendant points out that a hearsay objection to an out-of-court statement “may\nnot be overruled simply by identifying a nonhearsay purpose for admitting the statement.\nThe trial court must also find that the nonhearsay purpose is relevant to an issue in\ndispute.” (People v. Armendariz (1984) 37 Cal.3d 573, 585.) The trial court did exactly\nthat here.\n       When defense counsel suggested the defense was not arguing “that this litigation\nwas anything less than hostile nor do we intend to,” the trial court “[took] issue with the\nstatement that you are not disputing the level of hostility.” The trial court pointed out\nthat the cross-examination of Dolores Cordell the previous day sought to show a\nsettlement was in the offing, and “if the argument is that it’s the lawsuit that caused\n[defendant] to form the intent to have the Thompsons or Mr. Thompson taken out,\ncertainly that intent would be somewhat vitiated were one to assume that they were on\nthe verge of a settlement just prior to the murders. Otherwise it would have no\nrelevance.”23 And in an earlier discussion on the admissibility of the statement, the court\nobserved that “the fact that the victim appreciated the level of hatred and contempt\ncommunicated by [defendant] to others” was “pretty potent evidence” that “tends to show\nthat it existed,” contradicting the defense position that defendant’s statements to others\nwere merely “blowing off steam.” Similarly, the statement tends to corroborate Joel\n\n23     In his reply brief, defendant disavows reliance on the argument that\nMr. Thompson’s statement did not qualify under Evidence Code section 1250’s state-of-\nmind exception to the hearsay rule, contending his argument is that Ms. Lucia’s\ntestimony “was simply irrelevant.” He then cites People v. Jablonski (2006) 37 Cal.4th\n774 for the rule that a victim’s out-of-court statements expressing fear of a defendant are\nrelevant only when the victim’s conduct in conformity with that fear is in dispute. But\nJablonski was construing section 1250: “ ‘As our cases have made clear, “a victim’s out-\nof-court statements of fear of an accused are admissible under section 1250 only when\nthe victim’s conduct in conformity with that fear is in dispute. Absent such dispute, the\nstatements are irrelevant. [Citations.]” ’ [Citation.]” (Jablonski, at p. 819.) The\nprosecutor was clear: “[W]e could probably have 15 witnesses walk into the court . . .\nand say Mickey Thompson wasn’t afraid of anything. [¶] We’re not proposing this\nevidence to prove fear. We’re proposing this evidence to prove the level of animosity;\nthe level of vitriol in the litigation in general.”\n\n\n                                             87\n\fWeissler’s testimony later in the trial that he heard defendant say, in late 1987 or early\n1988, that he was “going to hurt [Mr. Thompson] and [his] family.”\n       In short, Mr. Thompson’s statement was not offered for its truth. It was offered\nfor the relevant, nonhearsay purpose of showing Mr. Thompson believed the litigation\nwith defendant was so vitriolic that he might carry out his threats to kill both Thompsons,\nwhich is circumstantial evidence of defendant’s motive. And there was no abuse of\ndiscretion in the trial court’s conclusion that the evidence was more probative than\nprejudicial. The record fully supports the trial court’s observation that the prejudicial\neffect was “minimal to nonexistent,” as it was “the same kind of evidence that we have\nheard from just about every witness that has testified so far.”24\n       For the same reasons – the presentation of similar evidence from many other\nwitnesses – any error in admission of Ms. Lucia’s testimony would have been harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. While defendant describes the admission of the testimony as\n“extraordinarily damaging,” particularly because of the reference to a sniper and because\nof the prosecution’s “hit man” theory, several other witnesses testified to defendant’s\nstatements about having Mr. Thompson killed. In addition, there was no argument to the\njury referring to the statement about a sniper. So, even if there were error in admitting\nMs. Lucia’s testimony – and we hold there was not – it was harmless.25\n\n24      Defendant also argues the statement did not fall within the spontaneous utterance\nexception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, § 1240.) While the trial court briefly referred\nto that theory of admissibility, it was not the basis for the trial court’s ultimate ruling (see\nfn. 21, ante), so we need not consider the point.\n\n25      Defendant points to the jury foreman’s declaration that the jury “discussed that\nthis statement was important in that it showed Thompson was in fear and that [defendant]\nwas the source of that fear,” and that Ms. Lucia “was one of fifteen witnesses who\ntestified about threats,” and “one of several witnesses regarding the threats that we\ndeemed credible.” As we observed earlier, statements such as these “concern[] the\nmental processes by which [the verdict] was determined” and cannot be used to impeach\nthe verdict. (Evid. Code, § 1150, subd. (a); Ovando v. County of Los Angeles (2008) 159\nCal.App.4th 42, 58 [“Evidence of jurors’ internal thought processes ordinarily is not\nadmissible to impeach a verdict.”].)\n\n\n                                              88\n\f7. Evidence of Defendant’s Threats to Third Persons\n        Under Evidence Code section 1101, evidence of a person’s character or a trait of\nhis or her character, including evidence of specific instances of his or her conduct, “is\ninadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion.” (Id.,\nsubd. (a).) But section 1101 does not prohibit the admission of evidence “that a person\ncommitted a crime, civil wrong, or other act when relevant to prove some fact (such as\nmotive [or] intent . . .) other than his or her disposition to commit such an act.” (Id.,\nsubd. (b); see People v. Catlin (2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 145, 146 [section 1101\n“recognizes . . . that there are facts other than criminal propensity to which other-crimes\nevidence may be relevant”; “[t]he categories listed in section 1101, subdivision (b), are\nexamples of facts that legitimately may be proved by other-crimes evidence, but . . . the\nlist is not exclusive”].)\n        “On appeal, the trial court’s determination of this issue, being essentially a\ndetermination of relevance, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” (People v. Kipp (1998)\n18 Cal.4th 349, 369.)\n        Defendant challenges the trial court’s admission of four instances of testimony\nfrom four different witnesses, claiming that the testimony in each instance was forbidden\nby Evidence Code section 1101. He also claims the testimony was inadmissible under\nsection 352, because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the probability\nthat its admission would “create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the\nissues, or of misleading the jury.” (§ 352.) The admission of this evidence, defendant\ncontends, violated his due process right to a fair trial “because it allowed the jury to find\nhim guilty of two murders because of the person he was, rather than what he actually\ndid.”\n        We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s rulings. In each case, the\nevidence consisted of statements by defendant that the trial court correctly viewed as\n\n\n\n\n                                              89\n\fadmissions,26 and they were offered to prove defendant’s motive or state of mind, not to\nprove his disposition to commit murder. Nor was there any error in concluding the\nevidence was more probative than prejudicial. The disputed evidence was as follows:\n       Charles Stewart Linkletter was permitted to testify to a “diatribe” he heard, while\ndefendant and Mr. Thompson were negotiating their business agreement, in which\ndefendant said “he was going to screw Mickey out of his business” and “rip him off.”\n(See fn. 2, ante.) Then defendant told Mr. Linkletter, “Stew, if you ever say a word about\nthis conversation to anybody, I will fucking kill you.”\n       Defense counsel argued this evidence “bears no relevance to the murder,” and\n“[i]t’s simply to say that [defendant’s] a bad guy.” The trial court disagreed, observing\nthat “the People’s case rests primarily on the fact that they believe that there was a motive\non the part of [defendant] to do harm to the Thompsons, or Mr. Thompson, because of a\nbusiness dispute gone bad leading to a judgment.” And: “[t]his conversation, though, is\nspecifically with reference to the partnership agreement which formed the basis of a\nlawsuit. So I think it’s – I don’t see it as character evidence. I see it as relevant and an\nadmission on the part of [defendant]. And it tends to show his state of mind with respect\nto his business dealings with Mr. Thompson. [¶] In addition, the fact that he makes a\nthreat, allegedly, to Mr. Linkletter, I can’t imagine that that’s being offered by the People\nas [section] 1101 evidence to prove since he made the threat to someone on that occasion,\ntherefore, he made a threat . . . with respect to this occasion, the 1987/’88 litigation.”\n       The court summarized, repeating that the defendant’s statements Mr. Linkletter\noverheard were “certainly relevant with respect to his state of mind, which if one were to\nbelieve the statements that he fully intended to rip off Mr. Thompson, which is similar to\nthe claim, I guess, in the litigation that was pending at the time. [¶] So I do see its\nrelevance and I don’t see it as too prejudicial. I don’t think the People are offering it to\n\n\n26     “Evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when\noffered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party . . . .” (Evid. Code,\n§ 1220.)\n\n\n                                              90\n\fprove conduct in conformity with a character trait. I think they’re offering it for a\npermissible purpose that does not violate [Evidence Code section] 1101, [subdivision]\n(b).”\n        In addition, defendant objected to certain of the testimony of Penn Weldon and\nJeffrey Coyne. Penn Weldon was a private investigator; in addition to testifying that\ndefendant said Mickey Thompson “had ruined his life and he wanted to get even with\nhim,” Mr. Weldon testified defendant wanted him to place listening devices in the home\nand cars of Phillip Bartinetti (Mickey Thompson’s attorney). (See pt. 2.g., ante, of the\nfacts.) Jeffrey Coyne was the bankruptcy trustee who was marshalling the assets of the\nbankruptcy estate; he testified about threats defendant made to him a few weeks before\nthe murders, after a meeting at which Mr. Coyne had refused several demands defendant\nmade relating to payments to and from the bankruptcy estate. (Defendant, trembling and\nin a “black rage,” said, “You better lighten up or things will get bad,” and “If you fuck up\nmy life, I’ll fuck up yours.”)27\n        The trial court said, as to Mr. Weldon’s testimony, that “there was an established\nrelationship between Bartinetti’s law firm; Bartinetti himself with the Thompsons.\nI mean, I don’t know how you separate them. Being angry at Bartinetti is certainly\nrelevant on the issue of one’s anger about the lawsuit which is the stated motive for the\nmurders. So I don’t have a problem with it.” Defendant does not cite any specific\ncomments by the court as to Mr. Coyne’s testimony, but the prosecutor argued that the\nsame animosity defendant felt for Mickey Thompson was extended to both Mr. Coyne\n\n27      In his brief, defendant states that Mr. Coyne “told the jurors he was so afraid of\n[defendant] he got a bullet-proof vest and a concealed weapons permit.” There was no\nsuch testimony before the jury; in a discussion of Mr. Coyne’s prospective testimony, the\nprosecutor told the trial court that the bankruptcy court had approved an application by\nMr. Coyne for a bullet-proof vest and handgun. Mr. Coyne did testify that the threats\ndefendant made to him had an impact on his decision to resign as trustee: “Those\nstatements in conjunction with the deaths of Mickey Thompson and his wife Trudy, left\nme in a place where I could not objectively work with this estate. I was so angry and so\nupset as to have no ability to continue to be fair or even in my own framework be\njustified in continuing to do things that required objectivity.”\n\n\n                                             91\n\fand Mr. Bartinetti. The court observed: “[t]he argument is that the defendant made\ncertain statements which circumstantially tend to indicate that he was going to cause\nharm to Mr. Thompson and did, in fact, cause the death,” and “[w]e’re talking about\nstatements that were made to everyone, . . . including Penn Weldon,” and “these are all\nstatements of [defendant]. And as such, they would qualify as admissions. They tend to\nindicate when taken with other evidence, that he was responsible – [¶] . . . [¶] . . . – for\nthe crime.”\n       And finally, Lance Johnson, a friend of the Thompsons, testified to a threat he\nheard defendant make, years after the murders, to Mickey Thompson’s sister: “You’re\ngoing to get yours, bitch.” The court said the statement was “clearly an admission on the\npart of the defendant. And it tends to show either he is, in fact, the one that is responsible\nfor the death of Mr. Thompson and his wife. Or because of being accused of that, he\nfinds Mrs. Campbell to be the responsible party and now wants to threaten her, which is\nconsciousness of guilt. [¶] . . . The fact of the matter is it is a statement. It’s probative.\nThe prejudicial effect is minimal because this whole case has been basically statements of\nthe defendant.”\n       Defendant argues that “hostility toward people other than Thompson did not prove\nanything related to the murders,” and in any event the relevance of the testimony was\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect. We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ncontrary conclusions on both points. We have just described the court’s analysis in some\ndetail, and that analysis is sound. And even if the testimony were analyzed as evidence\nof “prior offenses” that may not be introduced “solely to prove criminal disposition,”\nsuch testimony “may properly be admitted whenever it tends logically, naturally, and by\nreasonable inference to establish any fact material for the People . . . .” (People v.\nMontalvo (1971) 4 Cal.3d 328, 331-332.) That is the case here.\n       In each instance, the testimony described a statement by defendant that was highly\nrelevant to prove the extreme level of hostility defendant harbored toward\nMr. Thompson, supplying defendant’s motive for the murders. The testimony was not\ncumulative because each witness testified to different circumstances in which defendant\n\n                                              92\n\feffectively expressed his extreme hatred of Mr. Thompson, sustained over time, either\ndirectly or toward those who allied themselves with Mr. Thompson’s interests and\nopposed defendant’s efforts to avoid paying the Thompson judgment. There was nothing\nin the testimony to “confuse[] the jury”; nor was any of the cited testimony significantly\nmore inflammatory than the rest of the evidence. In short, there was no error and, as\nnecessarily follows, no due process violation.28 (See People v. Partida (2005) 37 Cal.4th\n428, 439 [“the admission of evidence, even if erroneous under state law, results in a due\nprocess violation only if it makes the trial fundamentally unfair”].)\n8. Character Evidence – Mickey Thompson\n       Defendant objected on relevance grounds, and in one instance on “character\nevidence” grounds, to a number of questions posed by the prosecutor to several\nwitnesses. On appeal, he argues the trial court prejudicially erred by permitting\n“irrelevant evidence of Thompson’s good character,” and the court “acted contrary to law\n– specifically contrary to Evidence Code [section] 1103” when it admitted the evidence.\nWe find no merit in defendant’s contentions.\n       Only relevant evidence is admissible (Evid. Code, §§ 210, 350), and the trial court\n“lacks discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.” (People v. Benavides (2005) 35 Cal.4th\n69, 90.) Evidence is relevant if it “ ‘tends “logically, naturally, and by reasonable\ninference” to establish material facts such as identity, intent, or motive.’ ” (Ibid.) In a\ncriminal action, evidence of the character of the crime victim “is not made inadmissible\nby Section 1101” – which prohibits character evidence to prove conduct on a specified\noccasion – if it is offered by the defendant “to prove conduct of the victim in conformity\n\n28      Again, defendant cites the jury foreman’s declaration stating the jury discussed\n“the character evidence that had been offered against [defendant],” and that “certain\nwitnesses clearly painted [defendant] as a good and honorable fellow and [defendant] as\njust the opposite.” The “bad character” of defendant was “very evident from the\ntestimony of these witnesses,” and “we could not escape the reality that, coupled with his\novertly stated hatred of Mickey Thompson, this guy was the kind of guy who was capable\nof coordinating this event.” These statements cannot be used to impeach the verdict.\n(See fn. 25, ante.)\n\n\n                                              93\n\fwith the character or trait of character,” or if it is offered by the prosecutor to rebut such\nevidence adduced by the defendant. (§ 1103, subd. (a).)\n       We preface our discussion by noting that Evidence Code section 1103 has no\napplication here. No evidence was offered or admitted to prove any conduct by the\nvictim in conformity with his character. The only issue is the relevance of the testimony\nto prove something other than the victim’s character (which is irrelevant). Defendant’s\nclaims of error are as follows.\n       First, William Wilson, who had worked with both Mickey Thompson and\ndefendant on various sports promotions and who had both a professional and social\nrelationship with Mr. Thompson, was permitted to testify about Mr. Thompson’s deep\naffection for his wife, over a defense objection that the question “calls for character\nevidence” and relevance. Mr. Wilson recounted that at their first dinner together, “all\n[Mr. Thompson] could do was talk about Trudy; about how much he loved her; the light\nof my life. And he got her a ‘10’ necklace that she wore on her neck with diamonds.\nAnd he just glowed. You could just tell the man was tremendously in love with Trudy.”\n       Mr. Wilson’s testimony about Mr. Thompson’s love for his wife was not irrelevant\nevidence of his character. It was relevant evidence supporting the inference that the\nshootings were planned in such a way as to force Mr. Thompson to watch his wife being\nmurdered. In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury he would prove that\nMickey Thompson was “kept alive” until he could see his wife being executed. And\nAllison Triarsi gave testimony lending support to that theory, stating that one of the\ngunmen held Mr. Thompson at bay as he pleaded for his wife’s life and while the other\ngunman shot Trudy Thompson. The nature of the Thompsons’ relationship was a\nmaterial point, as the evidence at the murder scene suggested both Thompsons were\ntargeted for killing, while defendant’s acrimony was directed at Mr. Thompson, not at\nTrudy Thompson. Testimony showing that Mr. Thompson’s devotion to his wife was\napparent to his colleagues was thus relevant to show the motive for murdering Trudy\nThompson.\n\n\n\n                                              94\n\f       Second, Gregory Smith, the Anaheim Stadium executive who stopped doing\nbusiness with defendant and hired Mr. Thompson and another company to produce the\nstadium’s motor sports events, testified that it was critical that the promoters they hired\nbe cooperative in promoting each other’s events. After the witness explained how\nMickey Thompson met that criterion, defendant objected, on relevance grounds, to the\nquestion, “Was he [(Mr. Thompson)] easy or difficult to deal with on a business level?”\nMr. Smith was thus permitted to testify that “Mickey Thompson was a very easy, very\nhonorable man to deal with.”\n       Mr. Smith’s testimony was not irrelevant evidence of Mickey Thompson’s\ncharacter. It was relevant evidence explaining why Anaheim Stadium chose to do\nbusiness with Mr. Thompson and not with defendant – a decision that angered defendant,\nand was part and parcel of events explaining the development of defendant’s extreme\nhostility toward Mr. Thompson.\n       Third, Philip Bartinetti, Mr. Thompson’s lawyer, testified that he came to know\nMr. Thompson as more than a client. Over a defense objection on relevance grounds,\nMr. Bartinetti was allowed to testify that their relationship “became a very good\nfriendship.” After a discussion at sidebar where defense counsel objected that the\nprosecutor was trying to elicit good character evidence, the prosecutor said he would end\nhis examination by asking Mr. Bartinetti where and when he found out about Mickey\nThompson’s death. A defense objection on relevance grounds was overruled after the\nprosecutor pointed out that Mr. Bartinetti continued to represent the estate after the\nmurders. Mr. Bartinetti then answered that he was getting ready to go to work and heard\nabout the murders when he received a phone call between 8:00 and 9:00 on the morning\nof the murders.29\n       Defendant does not explain how Mr. Bartinetti’s testimony could be “irrelevant\nevidence of Thompson’s good character,” since the testimony had nothing to do with\nMr. Thompson’s character. In any event, the testimony about the friendship was relevant\n\n29   Defendant says Mr. Bartinetti testified that the phone call was from Collene\nCampbell, but that testimony was stricken from the record.\n\n                                             95\n\fin the context of other evidence the prosecutor later elicited to show that defendant’s rage\nagainst Mr. Thompson was so extreme that it extended to his friends and allies. (See\npt. 7, ante.)\n       Of course, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the probability that its admission will “create substantial danger of undue\nprejudice . . . .” (Evid. Code, § 352.) Defendant says it is “hard to imagine more\nprejudicial facts than that [defendant] – who was known for being loud, obnoxious and\nabusive – was allegedly responsible for the brutal murders of two such beloved\nindividuals,” and that the prosecutor “unfairly set up a good guy / bad guy dichotomy.”\nThis is mere hyperbole. “Evidence is prejudicial within the meaning of . . . section 352 if\nit ‘ “uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual” ’ . . . or if\nit would cause the jury to ‘ “ ‘prejudg[e]’ a person or cause on the basis of extraneous\nfactors.” ’ ” (Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 475, citations omitted.) None of the\nevidence cited falls into that category.\n       The final claim defendant places in his list of “irrelevant evidence of\nMr. Thompson’s good character” involves a photograph of the victims that was\nintroduced, without objection, for identification purposes. On the first day of testimony,\nduring the afternoon session beginning at 1:30, defense counsel presented her opening\nstatement, after which the prosecution called its first witness, William Wilson. Just\nbefore Mr. Wilson testified, a photograph of the victims was marked for identification,\nand Mr. Wilson identified the victims and testified he knew them personally.\n       Defendant complains that the prosecutors left the photograph on the projector for\nthe jury to see “during the entire first day’s proceedings” (a clear exaggeration), and that\nit was “misconduct” to display a sympathetic photograph to the jury “long after the\npurpose of the display had been satisfied.” But the trial court could not see the display\nfrom the bench, and defense counsel did not object until the following day. The trial\ncourt pointed out that the controls to the projector were “right there,” and one of\ndefendant’s attorneys indicated that he had eventually covered the projector.\n\n\n\n                                              96\n\f       But defense counsel told the court “it’s bad form to do it in the first place, and they\nknow it,” and asked the court “to admonish them that . . . we’re all aware that this was a\ntrick that happened yesterday and ask that it not be repeated.” The court said, “I can’t say\nit was a trick,” and that the simplest thing for defense counsel to have done was to ask,\n“Can we approach?” Defense counsel responded that, if she had done so, the photograph\nwould have been removed and “it would have been quite obvious that we objected to this\nnice family photo being up in front of the jury.” When the court then asked what defense\ncounsel wanted the court to do, counsel said, “Nothing. We’ve had the discussion.\nThat’s all I was asking.” The court reiterated that it could not do anything unless\nsomething is brought to its attention, “[a]nd I think either counsel can hit that kill switch\n[to turn off the projector]. . . . So, I mean, that’s – it’s there. I don’t have access to it, but\nyou do.”\n       The nature of defendant’s claim of error on this point is unclear, but it is clear\nthere was no error. The photograph was properly admitted for identification and thus was\nnot “irrelevant evidence of good character.” The trial court cannot correct a problem of\nwhich it is not made aware, and there was no showing of deliberate prosecutorial\nmisconduct, prejudicial or otherwise. (See People v. Harrison (2005) 35 Cal.4th 208,\n242 [“A prosecutor’s misconduct ‘that does not render a criminal trial fundamentally\nunfair’ violates California law ‘only if it involves “ ‘the use of deceptive or reprehensible\nmethods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury.’ ” ’ ”].) Nothing of the sort\noccurred here.\n9. The Exclusion of Evidence Claimed to be Exculpatory\n       In People v. Hall (1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 829 (Hall), the Supreme Court\n“reaffirm[ed] the admissibility of any relevant evidence that raises a reasonable doubt as\nto a defendant’s guilt, including evidence tending to show that a party other than the\ndefendant committed the offense charged. Such evidence may be excluded only when\nthe court properly exercises its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 to reject\nevidence that creates a substantial danger of undue consumption of time or of\nprejudicing, confusing, or misleading the jury.”\n\n                                               97\n\f       “To be admissible, the third-party evidence . . . need only be capable of raising a\nreasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt. At the same time, we do not require that any\nevidence, however remote, must be admitted to show a third party’s possible culpability.\n[E]vidence of mere motive or opportunity to commit the crime in another person, without\nmore, will not suffice to raise a reasonable doubt about a defendant’s guilt: there must be\ndirect or circumstantial evidence linking the third person to the actual perpetration of the\ncrime.” (Hall, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 833; accord, People v. Abilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th 472,\n517 (Abilez) [“A criminal defendant may introduce evidence of third party culpability if\nsuch evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, but the evidence must consist of\ndirect or circumstantial evidence that links the third person to the crime. It is not enough\nthat another person has the motive or opportunity to commit it.”].)\n       Defendant contends the court denied him due process by excluding evidence of\nthird party culpability found in Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department investigative files on\nthe Thompson murders. We disagree.\n       a. Defendant’s third party culpability theory\n       Defendant proposed to show that a man named Dean Kennedy ordered the\nThompson murders, and they were committed by John Young (a very tall, athletically\nbuilt black man) and Kit Paepule (a dark-skinned, very stocky man of Samoan descent).\nThe theory was that Kennedy ordered the Thompson murders at the instance of a man\nnamed Larry Cowell, who had a motive for having the Thompsons murdered.\n       Cowell’s motive for murdering the Thompsons stemmed from Cowell having\nkilled Scott Campbell (Collene Campbell’s son and Mickey Thompson’s nephew). Scott\nCampbell was a drug dealer who in 1979 was convicted of manslaughter in the killing of\nanother drug dealer who had ties to the Vagos motorcycle gang. Cowell, who owned an\nauto repair shop for Pantera sports cars (a type of expensive sports car that Scott\nCampbell owned) had been a friend of the Thompson and Campbell families for years.\n       In 1982, Scott Campbell, who was then the target of an investigation of interstate\ntransportation of cocaine, arranged for Cowell to fly him in a private plane to North\nDakota in connection with an anticipated cocaine sale. Before the trip, he left his Pantera\n\n                                             98\n\fat Cowell’s shop for repairs. During the flight, Cowell and Donny DiMascio killed Scott\nCampbell and threw him out of the plane. The primary motive was robbery, but\nDiMascio was a known Vagos motorcycle gang associate, and the Vagos gang had been\nthreatening Scott Campbell since the 1979 killing.\n       Mickey Thompson testified at Larry Cowell’s first trial for the murder of Scott\nCampbell. Cowell had tried to fabricate an alibi for the murder by leaving telephone\nmessages for Scott Campbell (while he was missing during the weeks after the murder);\nthe messages said Campbell’s car was ready to be picked up after extensive repairs.\nMr. Thompson testified that he and the police went to Cowell’s shop, and Mr. Thompson\nsaw that the car was in pieces and missing major parts (as defendant puts it, “the car had\nnot been repaired at all – ruining the alibi”). Cowell was convicted, but the conviction\nwas overturned based on a coerced confession, and Mickey Thompson was killed before\nthe second trial (at which Cowell was again convicted).30\n       The theory continues: Cowell, who thus had motive, was a close friend of Ed\nLosinski (who owned a Pantera and used Cowell’s repair shop). Losinski was an\nengineer and mason who had also known Mickey Thompson for years, had worked on\nthe Thompson property and would know the neighborhood. Ed Losinski was also a good\nfriend of Dean Kennedy, whom he had met through the boat racing community; they both\nhad shops in the same area. Dean Kennedy, in December 1987, ordered two other\nmurders; he sent John Young and Kit Paepule to kill a drug dealer named Thomas Wilson\n(and his girlfriend if she were present), and a week later hired Young to kill Jerome\nGenoway (who was being investigated for drug dealing) and the woman who lived with\nhim (if she was present). Kennedy’s alleged motive for having Wilson killed was that he\nhad burglarized Kennedy’s home and was “disrespectful,” and his motive for having\nGenoway killed was to avoid paying money he owed Genoway. In taped conversations\n\n\n30      Respondent points out that Mr. Thompson’s testimony was not critical. He\ntestified that he saw the car at Cowell’s shop, missing major parts that were necessary for\noperation of the car, but that occurred a year after Scott Campbell’s murder.\n\n\n                                            99\n\fbetween Kennedy and a drug-smuggling friend, Kennedy said he was not worried about\ndoing time for the Wilson and Genoway murders, because he had a friend who was\nwilling to take the fall for him in return for cash. (Kennedy was convicted of these\nmurders and was in custody at the time of the Thompson murders.)\n       In addition: Richard Passmore, a neighbor of the Thompsons, saw a maroon\nVolvo with two athletic-looking African-American men unloading bicycles within a\ncouple of blocks of the murder scene a day or two before the murders. Larry Shaleen, a\nclose friend of Dean Kennedy, saw John Young (one of Kennedy’s hit men) driving a\nmaroon Volvo in the past. Shaleen visited Kennedy just before Kennedy was arrested,\nand noticed two brand new 10-speed bicycles in Kennedy’s garage, when Kennedy was\ntoo overweight to ride a bicycle. (Two of Kennedy’s neighbors, Linda Osborne and\nKathy O’Neill, also saw the bikes, and they heard Kennedy brag about knowing Mickey\nThompson “and about knowing the killers of Mickey Thompson’s nephew Scott\nCampbell.”) Hit man John Young “bears an uncanny resemblance” to the composite\ndrawings made of the men who killed the Thompsons, and his companion Kit Paepule\nhabitually wore a hooded sweatshirt, as in the composite drawing of the stockier shooter.\n(Linda Osborne and Kathy O’Neill also thought the composite drawing of the Mickey\nThompson shooter was John Young.)\n       Finally, the defense also sought to introduce evidence to show “that a local drug\nuser named Joey Hunter was their lookout for this crime.” (We have referred to some of\nthis evidence in pt. 3.c.x.A. & H., ante.) Five witnesses saw a white man “hitchhiking\nfrantically” with a bicycle at a bus stop, about two and a half miles from the crime scene\nand shortly after the murders. Two of those witnesses identified Mr. Hunter from a\nphotographic lineup. (The others identified someone other than Hunter, or said the\nperson they saw was not in the photographs they were shown.) Mr. Hunter was arrested.\nHe failed polygraph tests regarding his involvement in the Thompson murders, and told a\nfellow inmate that he was involved in the murders. He also confessed his involvement to\nhis cousin, Bonnie Dalton, telling her he was not worried about doing hard time, because\nhe worked for someone who promised him that if he took the fall he would only get two\n\n                                           100\n\fyears and would get $50,000.31 (The defense points out that Dean Kennedy similarly\nsaid, as noted above, that he had a friend who was willing to take the fall for the Wilson\nand Genoway murders in return for cash.)\n       In sum, the defense intended to show – “through the testimony of Larry Shaleen,\nRichard Passmore, Linda Osborne, and Kathy O’Neill,” as well as through the testimony\nof the two detectives who investigated the Wilson and Genoway murders – “that Dean\nKennedy and his hit men were responsible for the death of Mickey and Trudy\nThompson.” And the defense also intended to show that Joey Hunter was their lookout.\n       b. The trial court’s ruling\n       The court ruled that the connection “between Kennedy and Larry Cowell coupled\nwith presumably the two hit men . . . all of that I don’t see any connection. . . . It\ncertainly made for interesting reading . . . . But I don’t see even a remote theory here of\nrelevance.”\n       As for the Joey Hunter evidence, the court observed that “if, in fact, there are two\nwitnesses who put Joey Hunter at the scene and there are statements by Joey Hunter\nwhich can be construed as confessions or admissions at that point, perhaps there is\nsomething relevant.” Defense counsel then confirmed its offer of proof as stated by the\ncourt, and further that Joey Hunter’s statement to Ms. Dalton about being paid $50,000 to\ntake the fall was “a connection in and of itself to Dean Kennedy who indicated the exact\nsame plan.” The court responded, “it could be. But so it’s so tenuous, I don’t see this.”\n\n31      The prosecutor argued the confession to Hunter’s cousin, Bonnie Dalton, was\nunreliable. The prosecutor explained that, before Hunter was interviewed by the police\n(but after he was aware of the police’s interest in him), Ms. Dalton asked him if he\nmurdered the Thompsons, “to which he replied that he did not. Hunter then sarcastically\nsaid ‘I did it, Bonnie, I killed them.’ When she did not respond, he then started laughing\nand said ‘Ha, ha, you believe me, don’t you?’ Dalton then told Hunter that he was ‘full\nof shit,’ and the conversation ended.” And on the day before Hunter went to the police,\n“he got drunk and began rambling. Hunter told Dalton that he was the man on the\nbicycle and that the killers were not black but white men spray painted black. He also\nsaid that the Mafia wanted him to turn himself in, and that he would only get two years in\nprison. He said that the Mafia would pay him $50,000 for his time in jail.”\n\n\n                                             101\n\fDefense counsel replied that “when you combine all of them” – referring to John Young\ndriving a maroon Volvo and bicycles at Kennedy’s house when he could not ride them –\nwith Kennedy, who committed other horrific murders “very similar” to the Thompson\nmurders, “then the relevance comes. [W]hat we’re failing to do is put them all together.”\n       The court said “[t]here is a reason I can’t put them all together because the\nconnection or the links that you refer to are really tenuous. I just don’t see any\nconnection whatsoever between [the other contract murders] with this case.” “[I]n terms\nof relevance, I don’t see it. . . . What I am willing to say at this point is there may be\nsome relevant information with respect to the Joey Hunter connection.”\n       The court then invited counsel to “[t]ell me how under [Evidence Code\nsection] 352, the weighing and balancing, would dictate that I allow that information to\ncome in. Because it does require the testimony of two witnesses who will say that was\nhim. It does require that the cousin will attribute the two statements to him which could\ntend to incriminate him. But I can’t draw any other inferences from any of that. So I’m\nleft with a perhaps on Joey Hunter.”\n       The prosecutor argued defendant could not show the hitchhiker was relevant to the\nmurder, that it was unlikely Joey Hunter was the hitchhiker, Joey Hunter had an alibi, his\nstatements to his cousin were “asinine remarks,” and his alleged confession to deceased\ninmate Frank Gullet was inadmissible. The tenuous nature of the evidence surrounding\nMr. Hunter was “no better than the other 1300 clues that we’ve had saying I know the\nwhite guy on the bicycle.”\n       The court asked defense counsel if Joey Hunter could be connected to the crime\nscene, since the defense theory was that he was a lookout, not one of the perpetrators.\nCounsel said that two witnesses said the shooter at the bottom of the driveway “could\nhave been white.” Also, counsel had spoken to the person who gave Mr. Hunter an alibi,\nand if that person were to testify, he would say he had no recollection whatsoever. One\nof Trudy Thompson’s several broken-off acrylic fingernails was found east of the\ndriveway where her body lay, and counsel said this was circumstantial evidence she had\n\n\n\n                                             102\n\frun out of the driveway and then turned back because someone was standing on Woodlyn\nLane, and that person would have had to be white to avoid attracting attention.\n       The court then said that “it just boils down to what I seem to think potentially\nmight have relevance is Joey Hunter. But, again, that depends on a connection between\nJoey Hunter and the crime scene. And I’m not hearing it.” The court concluded that\n“whatever relevance the information regarding Joey Hunter might have, at this time I\ncan’t say that that relevance outweighs the undue consumption of time; confusion of the\nissues; and the potential for prejudice. But primarily the undue consumption of time and\nthe confusion of the issues. [¶] . . . I’m not finding that connection which I would like\nto see. So I’m not foreclosing this forever. I’m just saying right now I agree there is\nsome evidence to suggest that at least according to Bonnie Dalton that this Joey Hunter\nhad admitted some responsibility for the murders. [¶] Other than that . . . there are then\ntwo potential witnesses . . . who place Joey Hunter perhaps a few miles away hitchhiking\nwith a bicycle. At this point, I just don’t have that missing link. [¶] If . . . any of the\nwitnesses that I hear at the trial refer to an individual who appears to match the\ndescription of Joey Hunter as a look-out, I’m certainly willing to change my mind. But at\nthis point, I think it has marginal relevance. And the other side of that, under [Evidence\nCode section] 352, just overwhelms and outweighs the marginal relevance I think it has.”\n       c. Conclusions\n       We see no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of the proffered evidence of third\nparty culpability.\n       Hall is quite clear, and we repeat: “[E]vidence of mere motive or opportunity to\ncommit the crime in another person, without more, will not suffice to raise a reasonable\ndoubt about a defendant’s guilt: there must be direct or circumstantial evidence linking\nthe third person to the actual perpetration of the crime.” (Hall, supra, 41 Cal.3d at\np. 833.)\n       As to the theory that Dean Kennedy ordered the murders, there was no link at all\nbetween him and “the actual perpetration of the crime.” To recap: The only third person\nidentified with a conceivable motive was Larry Cowell, who may have wanted to prevent\n\n                                              103\n\fMickey Thompson from testifying at his second trial. But there was no connection\nbetween Cowell and Kennedy, except (1) they were both friends of Ed Losinski, who was\nfamiliar with the Thompson neighborhood, and (2) two of Kennedy’s neighbors said that\nKennedy said that he knew Scott Campbell’s murderers (of whom Cowell was one). But\nevidence – even if it were not inadmissible hearsay – that Kennedy knew Cowell does not\nby any stretch of the imagination create a link to the Thompson murders. (According to\nthe prosecutor, in January 1998 Kennedy was specifically asked if he knew Cowell, and\nconfirmed he did not.) And except for the hearsay statement from Kennedy’s neighbors\n(that he bragged that he knew Mickey Thompson), there was no evidence linking\nKennedy himself to the Thompsons, much less to their murders. In addition, both\nKennedy and Cowell were in custody, in separate facilities in different parts of\nCalifornia, when the Thompsons were murdered. In short, under the Hall requirements,\nthe Dean Kennedy evidence was plainly not relevant. (Hall, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 833;\nPeople v. Edelbacher (1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1018 [“Quite apart from the obvious hearsay\nproblems, defendant’s proposed evidence did not . . . link any third person to the\ncommission of the crime.”].)\n       As to the theory that Joey Hunter was the lookout, there was likewise no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court’s exclusion of defendant’s proffered evidence. Mr. Hunter himself\nhad no motive to murder the Thompsons; defendant showed no connection of any kind\nbetween Joey Hunter and Larry Cowell or Dean Kennedy or Ed Losinski or Kennedy’s\ntwo hit men for the other contract murders; and there is no evidence Joey Hunter was at\nthe crime scene. And, as respondent points out, the actual perpetrators of the Thompson\nmurders made their escape from the scene in minutes over a bike route leading to quick\nfreeway access – so even if Hunter was correctly identified as the man “frantically\nhitchhiking” with a bicycle, two miles from the murder scene and an hour later, it is hard\nto see how he could have been part of the conspirators’ plan for the Thompson murders.\nSo in the end, in light of the lack of any evidence linking Joey Hunter to the crime scene,\nonly his own statements to his cousin (see fn. 31, ante) and to deceased inmate Frank\nGullet (see pt. 3.c.x.H., ante) provide any kind of connection to the “actual perpetration\n\n                                            104\n\fof the crime.” Under these circumstances, the court did not err in finding that under\nEvidence Code section 352, the undue consumption of time and confusion of the issues\n“just overwhelms and outweighs the marginal relevance” of the Joey Hunter evidence.\n       Having failed to show any link between the Dean Kennedy/Larry Cowell evidence\nand “the actual perpetration of the crime,” or between Kennedy or Cowell or anyone else\nand Joey Hunter, defendant asserts that it was error to evaluate the evidence “solely under\nthe third party culpability standard” required by Hall. This is because “the point of this\nproposed evidence was not to show that a specific third party was guilty of the offense\ncharged,” as in Hall, “but rather to show the investigators were given information about\nJoey Hunter and other likely suspects and did not even pursue it.” Because of this\n“failure to pursue other leads,” defendant says, it is “unreasonable” to require him to\ncomply with Hall by presenting evidence that links those other suspects to the crime.\nThe exclusion of “the proposed evidence of what the police failed to do when\ninvestigating the Thompson murders,” he says, violated his due process rights; that\nevidence “would have helped prove what defense counsel identified as the central issue\nof [defendant’s] defense: if evidence did not point to [defendant], then investigators\nwould not look at it.” The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department investigators “could have\nbeen questioned about the information in their investigative reports,” which were “[t]he\nsources of most of the evidence that other people committed the Thompson\nmurders . . . .”\n       We note first that the assertion, repeated many times in defendant’s briefs, that\ninvestigators would not look at evidence if it did not point to defendant, is only that: an\nassertion without support in the record. The police obviously did investigate Joey Hunter\n(and indeed arrested him at an early stage).32 In 1998, police interviewed Kit Paepule\n\n32     Apparently defendant’s complaint is that Detective Griggs did not interview Joey\nHunter, and that “investigators never contacted Hunter again after 1988.” (Defense\ncounsel below asserted, “every single time this case was reopened, not a single\ninvestigator went to contact [Joey Hunter].” She claimed this was relevant to the defense,\n“separate and apart whether we are blaming him for the murder. It’s not for the truth of\nwhatever he was or whatever he did, it’s for the fact that because somewhere along the\n\n                                            105\n\fand John Young about the Thompson murders, both of whom denied involvement.\n(Young, serving life without parole, took full responsibility for the Wilson/Genoway\nmurders but adamantly denied any involvement in the Thompson murders.) Apparently,\npolice also interviewed Dean Kennedy, who denied knowing Larry Cowell. The\nsuggestion that police did not continue to pursue Joey Hunter after 1988, because\nsomehow they knew Hunter would not implicate defendant in the plot, is little short of\nludicrous. As the trial court noted at the hearing on defendant’s new trial motion, even if\ndefendant could show Joey Hunter was present as a look-out – and the defense presented\nno such evidence – that “doesn’t mean that there is a reasonable doubt that [defendant]\nwas involved.”\n       In short, it is complete speculation to suggest that the reason defendant could not\nestablish the requisite link between Dean Kennedy (or any of the other hypothetical\nconspirators) and the crime was because the police “conducted a wholly inadequate,\nbotched investigation,” thus violating defendant’s due process rights. There is simply no\nreason to believe that, if only the police had investigated other suspects further than they\ndid, they would have been able to connect Dean Kennedy or Joey Hunter or any of the\nothers to the murders.33 Defendant cites no legal authority for the notion that, because\ncounsel identified the claim of a “botched” or “biased” investigation as the “central issue\nof [defendant’s] defense,” the court therefore “had to permit him to use any available\nevidence casting doubt” on the investigation, without regard to the rules of evidence. We\n\n\nline some investigator said this guy is never going to lead you to [defendant], no\ninvestigator subsequently sat down with an interview with Joey Hunter; not since 1988.\nAnd that is relevant. And to be precluded from that is to be precluded from having a\ndefense in general.”) The trial court pointed out that was not the motion before the court,\nand “I can’t say without hearing what is going to be presented that you would not be able\nto elicit testimony regarding what leads were followed and what leads were ignored. I’m\njust not prepared to say that.”\n\n33     Defendant’s example of the “botched investigation” – other than not re-\ninvestigating Joey Hunter after 1988 – was that investigators never tested fingernail\nscrapings taken from the Thompsons (the defense later did so, with no useful results).\n\n\n                                            106\n\fthus reject defendant’s attempt to avoid the application of the principles established in\nHall for the exclusion of third party exculpatory evidence – principles correctly applied\nby the trial court when it excluded the proffered testimony.\n       Defendant’s reliance on cases such as Chambers v. Mississippi (1973) 410 U.S.\n284 (Chambers) for his due process claim does not persuade us otherwise. In Chambers,\nthe application of state evidentiary rules, “under the facts and circumstances of [that]\ncase,” deprived the defendant of a fair trial. (Id. at p. 303.) There, a third person named\nMcDonald had signed a sworn confession and later repudiated it. (Id. at pp. 288-289.)\nAt defendant Chambers’ trial, the state court excluded hearsay testimony critical to the\ndefense: testimony that McDonald had orally confessed the murder to three different\nfriends (confessions that were corroborated by other evidence in the case, and that bore\npersuasive assurances of trustworthiness). This exclusion – coupled with the state’s\nrefusal to permit the defendant to cross-examine McDonald because of a state rule that a\nparty may not impeach his own witness – denied the defendant a trial “in accord with\ntraditional and fundamental standards of due process.” (Id. at p. 302.)\n       This is not a case like Chambers. As the high court tells us, “Chambers\nspecifically confined its holding to the ‘facts and circumstances’ presented in that case;\nwe thus stressed that the ruling did not ‘signal any diminution in the respect traditionally\naccorded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial\nrules and procedures.’ [Citation.] Chambers therefore does not stand for the proposition\nthat the accused is denied a fair opportunity to defend himself whenever a state or federal\nrule excludes favorable evidence.” (United States v. Scheffer (1998) 523 U.S. 303, 316\n(Scheffer).)\n       Scheffer states the applicable rule: “A defendant’s right to present relevant\nevidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions. . . . [S]tate and\nfederal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding\nevidence from criminal trials. Such rules do not abridge an accused’s right to present a\ndefense so long as they are not ‘arbitrary’ or ‘disproportionate to the purposes they are\ndesigned to serve.’ . . . [W]e have found the exclusion of evidence to be\n\n                                             107\n\funconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a\nweighty interest of the accused.”34 (Scheffer, supra, 523 U.S. at p. 308, citations and fn.\nomitted; see Holmes v. South Carolina (2006) 547 U.S. 319, 325 (Holmes) [describing\n“arbitrary” rules as “rules that excluded important defense evidence but that did not serve\nany legitimate interests”].)\n       As Holmes tells us: “While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of\ndefense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate\nto the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit\ntrial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other\nfactors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.”\n(Holmes, supra, 547 U.S. at p. 326.) And as Holmes further tells us, “A specific\napplication of this principle is found in rules regulating the admission of evidence\nproffered by criminal defendants to show that someone else committed the crime with\nwhich they are charged,” and “[s]uch rules are widely accepted.” (Id. at p. 327.)\n       That is the case here. Nothing in California’s principles governing the exclusion\nof third party exculpatory evidence is arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they\nare designed to serve. As our Supreme Court has expressly stated, “the ordinary rules of\nevidence, including the application of Evidence Code section 352, do not infringe on the\n\n\n34     Defendant relies at length on Tinsley v. Borg (9th Cir. 1990) 895 F.2d 520, saying\nTinsley “outline[s] the test to be applied in evaluating whether excluding defense\nevidence amounts to a due process violation under Chambers . . . .” Tinsley does not\neven cite Chambers, and did not involve third party exculpatory evidence. Tinsley\nmerely tells us that, “[t]o evaluate whether the exclusion of evidence reaches\nconstitutional proportions, we should consider five factors: (1) the probative value of the\nexcluded evidence on the central issue; (2) its reliability; (3) whether it is capable of\nevaluation by the trier of fact; (4) whether it is the sole evidence on the issue or merely\ncumulative; and (5) whether it constitutes a major part of the attempted defense,” and\n“[w]e must then balance the importance of the evidence against the state interest in\nexclusion.” (Tinsley, at p. 530.) In the context of the exclusion of third party exculpatory\nevidence, we analyze the issue consonant with precedents from the high court and our\nown Supreme Court.\n\n\n                                             108\n\faccused’s due process right to present a defense.” (People v. Frye (1998) 18 Cal.4th 894,\n948; accord, Hall, supra, 41 Cal.3d at pp. 834-835.) Consequently, there is no merit to\ndefendant’s claim that the exclusion of the proffered evidence violated his due process\nright to present a defense.\n10. The Exclusion of Hearsay Evidence of Mickey Thompson’s Purchase\n    or Intent to Purchase Gold Just Before the Murders\n       a. The factual background and rulings\n       During the case-in-chief, defense counsel asked Detective Verdugo if he had any\nreason to believe Mickey Thompson had recently made a large purchase of gold coins,\nbut the detective knew nothing about that. Later, during the defense case, defense\ncounsel offered to present testimony that, in the weeks and months before the murders,\nMr. Thompson talked about buying gold, and the night before the murder, Eric Miller\nheard him say that he had just taken possession of $250,000 in gold. (See pt. 7.b. of the\nfacts, ante.)\n       Defense counsel agreed with the trial court that the defense wanted “to show that\nbasically Mr. Thompson was announcing to others his plan to acquire a large amount of\ngold.” The trial court observed that “[w]e’re not dealing with a hearsay exception, we’re\ndealing with circumstantial evidence to show that others may have had a motive.” The\ncourt said that if the defense could show the safe in the garage was empty and had pry\nmarks on it, the testimony “may have a great deal of relevance.” The court concluded it\n“would like to hear the foundation that the safe was empty and there were pry marks,”\nand if that testimony were presented, Mr. Miller’s testimony would be relevant as\ncircumstantial evidence of motive. “So I’m certainly happy to reconsider [the\nadmissibility of Mr. Miller’s testimony] based on what the defense has yet to present.”\n       The next day, the prosecutor told the court that police reports showed the damage\nto the garage safe occurred weeks after the murders. The court agreed that, if the defense\ncould not show that the safe had been tampered with on the day of the murders, then the\nnecessary foundation for relevance of the proffered testimony would be missing.\n\n\n\n                                           109\n\f       Defense counsel then stated that Lee Haslam and other witnesses would say that\nMr. Thompson said he intended to buy gold, “which is a different statement” and\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1250. (Section 1250 is an exception to the rule\nagainst hearsay, for “a statement of the declarant’s then existing state of mind, . . .\n(including a statement of intent [or] plan . . . ),” when the evidence “is offered to prove\nthe declarant’s state of mind . . . at that time or at any other time when it is itself an issue\nin the action,” or when it is “offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of the declarant.”\n(§ 1250, subd. (a).)) The court said that Mr. Thompson’s “state of mind with respect to\npurchase of gold” was not an issue in the case. If there were evidence there was gold in\nthe house and there was gold taken, the court said, that could be presented, but even if\nMr. Thompson’s statements could be admitted as a state of mind exception, “the\nrelevance of that is speculative at best.”\n       Defense counsel then asked to present testimony from Detective Laporte about\nMr. Miller’s statement. This testimony “would not be offered for the truth,” but for the\n“failure to investigate whether or not there were valuables in this garage.” The trial court\nagreed that the defense could “present all you want about the failure to investigate,” but\n“a statement made by Mr. Thompson prior to the murders that he was going to buy gold\ndoesn’t lead us anywhere.” The court said the defense could “ask the question as to what\n[the police] did or what they didn’t do without assuming facts that aren’t in\nevidence. . . .” When defense counsel sought to elicit testimony from Detective Laporte\nthat Mr. Miller told him Mr. Thompson had made a large purchase of gold recently,\nsaying it was “not offered for the truth,” but “to see what he did as a result of that\ninformation,” the court sustained the prosecutor’s hearsay objection. Detective Laporte\nthen testified that his notes showed he interviewed Eric Miller and Lee Haslam; his\nreports would have been given to the lead investigators; and he did not try to obtain any\nfinancial records.\n       Then, defense counsel sought to introduce Mr. Miller’s testimony about Mickey\nThompson’s statement, not for its truth, but “to explain why we’re asking these officers”\nwhether they sought Mr. Thompson’s financial records, that is, “for the purpose of\n\n                                              110\n\fshowing that the police did not investigate that angle.” When the court asked defense\ncounsel why she could not elicit the information “in a way that would meet your needs,\nwhich is: Did Mr. Miller provide information to the investigators which was not\nfollowed up,” counsel said that would be out of context, “[w]ithout saying that it was\ninformation about a recent purchase of a significant valuable item.” The court asked,\n“Well, why not refer to it that way,” and counsel responded, “I would love to refer to it\nthat way. That’s why I’m asking the court’s guidance as to that. I would be happy to not\nbring up the quote of the statement if I could say to Officer Laporte: Did you receive\ninformation from Eric Miller that Mr. Thompson had just come into a very valuable\ncommodity in the last several days?” And “the only thing further I would go is: What\ndid you do as a result? What did you follow-up on?” The court ruled: “I think that’s\nfair. Because we’re dealing with a statement that’s not being offered for the truth. But\nI’m attempting to sanitize it so that there is no danger of this jury being misled.” Further,\n“I don’t see a danger here in eliciting this type of testimony keeping it limited without\nreference to gold. I mean I’m just afraid that the jury will misconstrue it or be misled.\nSo I think the way we just agreed to handle it is appropriate.”\n       Defense counsel then elicited testimony from Eric Miller and Detective Laporte.\nWhen Mr. Miller was asked if he told Detective Laporte that Mickey Thompson had\ntaken possession of a valuable item recently, Mr. Miller said he “[did not] recall anything\nregarding taking possession, no.” When asked if Mr. Thompson indicated he had made a\nrecent purchase, Mr. Miller said, “No.” As previously described (pt. 7.b. of the facts,\nante), Detective Laporte then testified that Eric Miller had told him Mr. Thompson said\nhe had taken possession of a valuable item of a specific dollar amount, and that he\n(Detective Laporte) did not, and was not directed to, match up the dollar amount\nspecified with any of Mr. Thompson’s financial records, or look at his financial records at\nall. (The trial court admonished the jury that “this is being offered not for the truth of\nwhat Mr. Thompson may have said to Mr. Miller, but to explain the conduct of Officer\nLaporte.”)\n\n\n\n                                             111\n\f       b. Contentions and conclusions\n       On appeal, defendant argues that Mr. Thompson’s statements “about buying or\nhaving received gold were statements of intent . . . to perform an act and admissible to\nprove Thompson bought and received gold.” Defendant contends the trial court erred in\n“sanitizing” the testimony so that there was no reference to gold; this deprived him of key\nevidence that the killers were there to rob, not execute, the Thompsons, “and\ninvestigators ignored this lead in their zeal to see [defendant] prosecuted,” violating his\nright to present a defense.\n       We find no error by the trial court.\n       First, Mr. Thompson’s statement that he had recently taken possession of a large\namount of gold is not a statement of his “existing state of mind” or “intent” or “plan.” It\nis hearsay as to which there is no applicable exception.\n       Second, the other statements defendant proffered – from Lee Haslam and others\nthat Mr. Thompson said he intended to purchase gold – are statements of intent or plan.\nBut to be admissible under Evidence Code section 1250, Mr. Thompson’s intent to\npurchase gold must be “itself an issue in the action” (id., subd. (a)), and it was not. To\nthe extent defendant suggests Mr. Thompson’s statements of intent to purchase gold were\noffered to prove that he did purchase gold – that is, if the statements were “offered to\nprove . . . conduct of the declarant” (ibid.) – it is irrelevant. Mr. Thompson’s state of\nmind (intent to buy gold) would have been relevant had there been any evidence of a\nrobbery, or evidence that he communicated his intent to someone involved in the\nmurders, or evidence there was gold on the premises, but there was no such evidence.\nThe only evidence defendant can cite is that, according to one witness, one of the\nescaping bicyclists was carrying a white canvas bag, and a coin dealer testified that gold\ncoins are delivered in white canvas bags (usually with a metal seal on the top).35\n\n\n\n35     Lance Johnson described a small bag, about 12 inches long and four inches wide,\n“slung over the right shoulder” of the first bicyclist he could see; the bag “went up to a\ndrawstring, so it was more or less pear shaped,” and he could not remember the color.\n\n                                              112\n\f       Evidence of a gunman fleeing on a bicycle with a white canvas bag, however, is\nnot credible evidence of a robbery, and all the evidence was to the contrary. There was\nno evidence valuables were taken; there was evidence of money and jewelry left at the\nscene of the crime; there was no evidence of forced entry into the house; the garage door\nwas closed; and there was no evidence of pry marks on the garage safe on the day of the\nmurders. Under these circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to admit\nhearsay evidence that Mr. Thompson intended to buy gold.\n       Defendant insists the evidence was admissible under People v. Alcalde (1944) 24\nCal.2d 177, 187 (Alcalde), where the court stated the “[e]lements essential to\nadmissibility” of declarations of intent to do an act in the future. (The Legislature later\ncodified the Alcalde decision in Evidence Code section 1250.) (See People v. Majors\n(1998) 18 Cal.4th 385, 404 (Majors).) These essential elements are “ ‘that the\ndeclaration must tend to prove the declarant’s intention at the time it was made; it must\nhave been made under circumstances which naturally give verity to the utterance; it must\nbe relevant to an issue in the case.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Alcalde, at p. 187.) Defendant’s\nclaim again falters on the relevance element.\n       As Majors tells us, Alcalde “considered the admissibility of a decedent’s statement\nthat she was planning to go out with a man named Frank, the defendant’s nickname, on\nthe night she was killed.” (Majors, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 404.) Applying the essential\nelements test, Alcalde concluded that the murder victim’s statement was admissible\nbecause “it was a natural utterance made under circumstances which could create no\nsuspicion of untruth in the statement of her intent,” and “[u]nquestionably the deceased’s\nstatement of her intent and the logical inference to be drawn therefrom, namely, that she\nwas with the defendant that night, were relevant to the issue of the guilt of the\ndefendant.” (Alcalde, supra, 24 Cal.2d at pp. 187-188, italics added.) In addition, in\nAlcalde “the declaration was not the only fact from which an inference could be drawn\n\n\nSandra Johnson told police that one of the men was carrying a white canvas bag,\nshopping bag size.\n\n\n                                             113\n\fthat the deceased was with the defendant that night.” (Id. at p. 188; see also Majors, at p.\n405 [“[a]s in Alcalde, there are ample ‘corroborating circumstances’ ”].)\n       Defendant claims the three essential elements in Alcalde were met, but we do not\nagree. There is no “logical inference” to be drawn from Mr. Thompson’s statements that\nhe intended to buy gold, and consequently there is no relevance to any issue in the case.\nWe cannot logically infer from Mr. Thompson’s statements that the gold was at the\nThompson residence, or that the Thompson murderers knew about it, or that there was a\nrobbery. Mr. Thompson’s intent to buy gold is only relevant if there were evidence of a\nrobbery, and there was not. Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial\ncourt’s rulings that testimony about Mr. Thompson’s statements was hearsay and\ninadmissible for its truth.\n       As described above, the trial court permitted the defense to inquire about Mickey\nThompson’s statement to Mr. Miller, not for its truth, but in order to prove an inadequate\npolice investigation of Mr. Thompson’s purchase of gold (which would have been\ntraceable). Defendant asserts the court had no authority to “sanitize” the statement so\nthat it referred to a valuable item, rather than gold, and that this “vitiated the meaning and\nthe impact of the evidence.”\n       Defendant cites no authority for this claim, and we know of none. The evidence\nwas admitted for a limited purpose, and that purpose was served when defendant was\npermitted to elicit testimony that police did not investigate the recent purchase of a\nvaluable item or look at Mr. Thompson’s financial records at all. The court’s ruling\nallowed the defense to make its point about inadequate investigation, while avoiding\nhaving the jury misled by the unsupportable implication there was gold on the premises.\nThere was no error in the trial court’s approach.\n11. The Exclusion of Evidence that Joey Hunter Failed Three Polygraph\n    Examinations\n       Evidence Code section 351.1 prohibits the admission of polygraph evidence in any\ncriminal proceeding: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the results of a\npolygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer\n\n\n                                             114\n\fto take, failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination, shall not be admitted into\nevidence in any criminal proceeding, . . . unless all parties stipulate to the admission of\nsuch results.” (Id., subd. (a).)\n       Despite the clarity of the statutory prohibition, defendant contends the trial court\nshould have admitted evidence that Joey Hunter failed three polygraph examinations,\neven though the prosecutor would not stipulate. The exclusion of the evidence that Joey\nHunter failed polygraph tests, he says, “prevented him from impeaching Griggs,\nLillienfeld and the other investigators on a crucial issue – whether the murders were fully\nand fairly investigated.”\n       When the trial court refused to admit the evidence, it pointed out that it had\nexcluded third-party culpability evidence, and consequently, “even assuming that you are\nnot violating [Evidence Code] section 351.1, how is this relevant? I just don’t see the\nrelevance . . . given the third-party culpability hearing that we had and the rulings that I\nmade. [¶] I think you can certainly present your witnesses to testify as to what was done\nand what wasn’t done to some extent. But I don’t think you can go that far. I do believe\nit’s an exclusionary rule that basically precludes any reference to a polygraph in this case.\nAnd that is my ruling.”\n       There was no error in the trial court’s ruling. The statute unambiguously states\nthat “the results of a polygraph examination . . . shall not be admitted into evidence in any\ncriminal proceeding . . . .” (Evid. Code, § 351.1, subd. (a).) “The statutory ban against\nadmission of polygraph evidence ‘ “is a ‘rational and proportional means of advancing\nthe legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence.’ ” ’ [Citations.]” (People v.\nMcKinnon (2011) 52 Cal.4th 610, 663 (McKinnon).) The statute contains no exceptions\nto the rule. (Ibid. [“The state’s exclusion of polygraph evidence is adorned with no\nexceptions, and its stricture on admission of such evidence has been uniformly enforced\nby this court and the Court of Appeal.”].)\n       Further, the categorical rule against the admission of polygraph evidence does not\nviolate due process or the right to present a defense. (People v. Richardson (2008) 43\nCal.4th 959, 1032 [“in People v. Wilkinson (2004) 33 Cal.4th 821 . . . we . . . squarely\n\n                                             115\n\fheld that the categorical exclusion of the results of such examinations did not violate the\nfederal Constitution”]; see also Scheffer, supra, 523 U.S. at pp. 305, 315 [a military rule\nmaking polygraph evidence inadmissible in court-martial proceedings did not\nunconstitutionally abridge the right of accused members of the military to present a\ndefense; per se rule excluding all polygraph evidence “offend[ed] no constitutional\nprinciple”].)\n       Defendant nevertheless argues that the evidence was not offered “to endorse or\nattack the credibility of the answers Joey Hunter gave during his polygraph\nexaminations,” but “as an operative fact” to demonstrate that investigators “did not\nfollow their own protocols” and “did not follow facts pointing to other suspects” because\nthey “had already fixed on [defendant] as the perpetrator.”36 Evidence Code\nsection 351.1, however, does not distinguish among the purposes for which the results of\na polygraph test are offered. In McKinnon, the court expressly rejected a claim that\npolygraph evidence was properly admitted, “not to endorse or attack the credibility of\nanswers given during a polygraph examination, but to explain why [a witness], in his\npostpolygraph statement to police, changed his story about his involvement in the murder\nand implicated defendant as the killer.” (McKinnon, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 663\n[declining to recognize “a state-of-mind exception to . . . section 351.1 for this limited\npurpose”].) Similarly, in People v. Samuels (2005) 36 Cal.4th 96, 128, evidence that the\ndefendant cooperated with police by offering to take, and passing, a polygraph\n\n36      Defendant cites several Ninth Circuit cases saying that polygraph evidence is\ninadmissible if offered to prove the truth or falsity of the polygraph results, but\n“polygraph evidence which is an operative fact may be admissible.” (United States v.\nBowen (9th Cir. 1988) 857 F.2d 1337, 1341 [“If the polygraph evidence is being\nintroduced because it is relevant that a polygraph examination was given, regardless of\nthe result, then it may be admissible; or if the evidence is being introduced as a basis for a\ncause of action, then it may be admissible as well.”].) Here, the polygraph evidence does\nnot fit in either of those categories, and in any event none of the cases defendant cites\ninvolves Evidence Code section 351.1 (or any other statute) expressly stating that “the\nresults of a polygraph examination . . . shall not be admitted into evidence in any criminal\nproceeding . . . .”\n\n\n                                             116\n\fexamination was not admissible to refute the prosecution’s evidence that the defendant\nwas uncooperative during the investigation.\n       In the face of these authorities, defendant’s contention that an exception to\nEvidence Code section 351.1 should be made, where polygraph results are offered to\n“impeach[] the investigation,” is without merit. The trial court did not err.\n12. The Conspiracy Instructions\n       Defendant contends the trial court’s instructions on uncharged conspiracy vitiated\nthe presumption of innocence and lowered the prosecutor’s burden of proof. We review\nthis claim of instructional error de novo, and conclude there was no error.\n       Defendant first argues that no conspiracy instructions should have been given,\nbecause the prosecutor made no prima facie showing of the existence of a conspiracy by\nindependent evidence. We have considered and rejected that claim in part 2, ante.\n       Next, defendant argues the conspiracy instructions were incomplete and\nmisleading. We see no merit in this claim either.\n       The court instructed the jury on uncharged conspiracy with CALJIC No. 6.10.5\n(defining the terms “conspiracy” and “overt act” and describing the elements necessary to\nfind defendant to be a member of a conspiracy).37 In addition, the court gave CALJIC\n\n\n37       The trial court instructed, based on CALJIC No. 6.10.5: “A conspiracy is an\nagreement between two or more persons with the specific intent to agree to commit the\ncrime of murder, and with the further specific intent to commit that crime, followed by an\novert act committed in this state by one or more of the parties for the purpose of\naccomplishing the object of the agreement. Conspiracy is a crime, but is not charged as\nsuch in this case. [¶] In order to find a defendant to be a member of a conspiracy, in\naddition to proof of the unlawful agreement and specific intent, there must be proof of the\ncommission of at least one overt act. It is not necessary to such a finding as to any\nparticular defendant that defendant personally committed the overt act, if he was one of\nthe conspirators when the alleged overt act was committed. [¶] The term ‘overt act’\nmeans any step taken or act committed by one or more of the conspirators which goes\nbeyond mere planning or agreement to commit a crime and which step or act is done in\nfurtherance of the accomplishment of the object of the conspiracy. [¶] To be an ‘overt\nact,’ the step taken or act committed need not, in and of itself, constitute the crime or\neven an attempt to commit the crime which is the ultimate object of the conspiracy. Nor\nis it required that the step or act, in and of itself, be a criminal or unlawful act.”\n\n                                            117\n\fNo. 6.12 (that proof of an express agreement is not necessary, and may be inferred from\nall circumstances tending to show the common intent),38 as well as CALJIC No. 6.11 (on\njoint responsibility of each member of a conspiracy for the acts of the other conspirators)\nand CALJIC No. 6.14 (that acquaintance with all coconspirators is not necessary).39\n       Defendant argues that the trial court also should have instructed with CALJIC\nNo. 6.22. That instruction says that each defendant in a conspiracy case is individually\nentitled to a determination whether he or she was a member of the conspiracy, and that\nthe jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a conspiracy to commit the\ncrime, that a defendant “willfully, intentionally and knowingly” joined with others in the\nconspiracy, and that one of them committed an overt act.40 Defendant argues that, by\nincluding CALJIC No. 6.12 (that proof of an express agreement is not necessary), but\n\n\n38     Under CALJIC No. 6.12, the court instructed: “The formation and existence of a\nconspiracy may be inferred from all circumstances tending to show the common intent\nand may be proved in the same way as any other fact may be proved, either by direct\ntestimony of the fact or by circumstantial evidence, or by both direct and circumstantial\nevidence. It is not necessary to show a meeting of the alleged conspirators or the making\nof an express or formal agreement.”\n39     In the trial court, defendant argued that CALJIC No. 6.10.5 (defining conspiracy\nand overt acts) was the only conspiracy instruction that should be given in an uncharged\nconspiracy case.\n\n40     CALJIC No. 6.22 – entitled “conspiracy – case must be considered as to each\ndefendant” – states: “Each defendant in this case is individually entitled to, and must\nreceive, your determination whether [he] [she] was a member of the alleged conspiracy.\nAs to each defendant you must determine whether [he] [she] was a conspirator by\ndeciding whether [he] [she] willfully, intentionally and knowingly joined with any other\nor others in the alleged conspiracy. [¶] Before you may return a guilty verdict as to any\ndefendant of the crime of conspiracy, you must unanimously agree and find beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that (1) there was a conspiracy to commit the crime[s] of , and (2) a\ndefendant willfully, intentionally and knowingly joined with any other or others in the\nalleged conspiracy. You must also unanimously agree and find beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, that an overt act was committed by one of the conspirators. You are not required\nto unanimously agree as to who committed an overt act, or which overt act was\ncommitted, so long as each of you finds beyond a reasonable doubt, that one of the\nconspirators committed one of the acts alleged in the [information] [indictment] to be\novert acts.”\n\n                                            118\n\ffailing also to instruct with CALJIC No. 6.22, the court “did not make clear for the jury\nthat a conspiratorial agreement must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,” and thus\n“misled” the jurors.41 Defendant also asserts that CALJIC No. 17.00 – instructing the\njury to “decide separately whether each of the defendants is guilty or not guilty” (italics\nadded) – should have been given. Defendant is mistaken.First, defendant did not request\nthe court to instruct with CALJIC Nos. 6.22 and 17.00 (or CALJIC No. 6.18).42 “To the\nextent defendant’s claim is that the court failed to give clarifying or amplifying\ninstructions, the claim is waived because defendant did not request such clarification\nbelow.” (People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1020.)\n       Second, CALJIC No. 6.22 by its plain terms is intended for use in a case where\nmultiple defendants are charged with the crime of conspiracy (and CALJIC No. 17.00 is\nlikewise for use in a multiple-defendant case). This case involves neither multiple\ndefendants nor a conspiracy charge. A trial court has no sua sponte duty to give an\ninstruction that does not apply to the case.\n       Third, there is in any event no merit to the claim that the instructions as given\nsomehow “lowered the prosecutor’s burden of proof.” “It is well established in\nCalifornia that the correctness of jury instructions is to be determined from the entire\ncharge of the court, not from a consideration of parts of an instruction or from a particular\ninstruction.” (People v. Burgener (1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 538, disapproved on other\ngrounds in People v. Reyes (1998) 19 Cal.4th 743, 753-754, 756; accord, People v.\nWilliams (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 705, 711 [concluding the Judicial Council’s criminal\n\n41     Defendant does not challenge the court’s other conspiracy instructions (CALJIC\nNos. 6.11 and 6.14), observing only that CALJIC No. 6.11 “does not satisfy the purpose\nof CALJIC No. 6.22.”\n\n42     Defendant states that the court did not instruct the jury “in the language of\nCALJIC 6.22 or 6.18,” but he presents no explanation or argument about CALJIC\nNo. 6.18, except to say that the trial court’s failure to give it “compounded this\n[instructional] error.” (CALJIC No. 6.18 states that “[e]vidence of the commission of an\nact which furthered the purpose of an alleged conspiracy is not, in itself, sufficient to\nprove that the person committing the act was a member of the alleged conspiracy.”)\n\n\n                                               119\n\fjury instruction on evidence of uncharged conspiracy (CALCRIM No. 416) did not\nreduce the prosecutor’s burden of proof].)\n       Here, the jury was instructed that a conspiracy was “an agreement between two or\nmore persons with the specific intent to agree to commit the crime of murder,” and the\ninstruction made it quite clear that the prosecutor had to prove the agreement, the intent\nto agree to commit murder, and an overt act: “In order to find a defendant to be a\nmember of a conspiracy, in addition to proof of the unlawful agreement and specific\nintent, there must be proof of the commission of at least one overt act.” (Italics added.)\nThe jury was also instructed that “each fact which is essential to complete a set of\ncircumstances necessary to establish the defendant’s guilt must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” The jury was instructed that “before an inference essential to\nestablish guilt may be found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, each fact or\ncircumstance on which the inference necessarily rests must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” (CALJIC No. 2.01.) The jury was instructed that defendant was\npresumed to be innocent and the People had “the burden of proving [defendant] guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” (CALJIC No. 2.90.) The jury was instructed that the\nburden was “on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is the\nperson who committed the crime with which he is charged.” (CALJIC No. 2.91.)\n       In short, it is quite clear that, “[c]onsidered as a whole, the instructions did not\nreduce the prosecution’s burden of proof.” (People v. Williams, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 711.) There was no error.\n13. The Jury Instruction on Eyewitness Identification\n       Defendant argues the trial court violated his state and federal due process rights\nwhen it instructed the jury that it could consider a witness’s level of certainty when\nevaluating an eyewitness’s identification. We disagree.\n       The court instructed the jury, without objection, with a modified version of\nCALJIC No. 2.92, as follows: “Eyewitness testimony has been received in this trial. In\ndetermining the weight to be given eyewitness identification testimony, you should\nconsider the believability of the eyewitness as well as other factors which bear upon the\n\n                                             120\n\faccuracy of the witness’ identification of the defendant, including, but not limited to, any\nof the following: [¶] . . . [¶] The extent to which the witness is either certain or\nuncertain of the identification . . . .” The instruction also listed a dozen other factors the\njury should consider, including the length of time between the act and the identification,\nwhether the identification is in fact the product of the witness’s own recollection, and so\non.43\n        The witness’s certainty or uncertainty has long been used as a factor in evaluating\neyewitness identifications, and its use does not violate due process. In Neil v. Biggers\n(1972) 409 U.S. 188, the court found that, under the totality of the circumstances, the\nshow-up identification in that case was reliable “even though the confrontation procedure\nwas suggestive.” (Id. at p. 199.) The court continued: “As indicated by our cases, the\nfactors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include the\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’\ndegree of attention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the criminal, the\nlevel of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time\nbetween the crime and the confrontation.” (Id. at pp. 199-200; see also Manson v.\nBrathwaite (1977) 432 U.S. 98, 117 (Manson) [“the criteria laid down in Biggers are to\nbe applied in determining the admissibility of evidence offered by the prosecution\n\n43      The factors listed in the instruction were: “The opportunity of the witness to\nobserve the act and the perpetrator of the act; [¶] The stress, if any, to which the witness\nwas subjected at the time of the observation; [¶] The witness’ ability, following the\nobservation, to provide a description of the perpetrator of the act; [¶] The extent to\nwhich the defendant either fits or does not fit the description of the perpetrator previously\ngiven by the witness; [¶] The cross-racial or ethnic nature of the identification; [¶] The\nwitness’ capacity to make an identification; [¶] Evidence relating to the witness’ ability\nto identify other perpetrators of the act; [¶] Whether the witness was able to identify the\nalleged perpetrator in a photographic or physical lineup; [¶] The period of time between\nthe act and the witness’ identification; [¶] Whether the witness had prior contacts with\nthe perpetrator; [¶] The extent to which the witness is either certain or uncertain of the\nidentification; [¶] Whether the witness’ identification is in fact the product of his her\nown recollection; and [¶] Any other evidence relating to the witness’ ability to make an\nidentification.”\n\n\n                                              121\n\fconcerning a[n] . . . identification”]; see also Perry v. New Hampshire (2012)\n___ U.S. ___ [132 S.Ct. 716, 725, fn. 5, 728] [footnoting the factors as listed in Biggers\nand Manson, and holding that “[t]he fallibility of eyewitness evidence does not, without\nthe taint of improper state conduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to\nscreen such evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its\ncreditworthiness.”].)\n       Further, as defendant admits, the California Supreme Court has approved CALJIC\nNo. 2.92. (People v. Johnson (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1230-1231 (Johnson) [“CALJIC\nNo. 2.92 normally provides sufficient guidance on the subject of eyewitness\nidentification factors”].) Johnson rejected a claim of trial court error in instructing the\njury on the certainty factor. (Id. at pp. 1231-1232 [the defendant contended there was no\nevidence to support the instruction because an expert testified, without contradiction, that\na witness’s confidence in an identification does not positively correlate with its accuracy;\nthe court concluded the trial court “did not err . . . in instructing the jury on the ‘certainty’\nfactor”].) Johnson also cited the certainty factor when it restated “the principles that\ndetermine whether the admission of identification evidence violates a defendant’s right to\ndue process.” (Id. at p. 1216.) The court said that “[c]onstitutional reliability . . .\ndepends on (1) whether the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and\nunnecessary [citing Manson]; and, if so, (2) whether the identification itself was\nnevertheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances, taking into account such\nfactors as the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\nwitness’s degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the\nlevel of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and\nthe confrontation. [Citation.] ‘If, and only if, the answer to the first question is yes and\nthe answer to the second is no, is the identification constitutionally unreliable.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       In the face of this solid body of law, defendant nonetheless argues the instruction\nviolated his right to due process, because “[s]ubsequent research . . . has shown the\n\n\n\n                                              122\n\fcertainty with which the witness makes the identification has little correlation with the\naccuracy of that identification.” The argument fails.\n       First, defendant did not object to the instruction; indeed, CALJIC NO. 2.92\nappears on defendant’s list of requested instructions. When an instruction is a correct\nstatement of the law and the defendant claims it should have been modified, “his failure\nto seek such modification forfeits the claim.” (People v. Richardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\npp. 1022-1023 [“while the court may review unobjected-to instruction that allegedly\nimplicates defendant’s substantial rights, claim that instruction, correct in law, should\nhave been modified ‘is not cognizable, however, because defendant was obligated to\nrequest clarification and failed to do so,’ ” quoting People v. Guerra, supra, 37 Cal.4th at\np. 1134].)\n       Second, we cannot in any event find a due process violation. Defendant relies\nonly on authorities from other jurisdictions, such as Brodes v. State (2005) 279 Ga. 435.\nThere, the court held (over a dissent) that, because of studies showing no correlation\nbetween certainty and accuracy, “we can no longer endorse an instruction authorizing\njurors to consider the witness’s certainty in his/her identification as a factor to be used in\ndeciding the reliability of that identification.” (Id. at p. 440.) But cases from other\njurisdictions do not assist defendant, as we are bound by the decisions of our Supreme\nCourt and the high court and, as we have seen, their directions are clear.\n       We cannot end without noting that “the jury, not the judge, traditionally\ndetermines the reliability of evidence,” and there are “other safeguards built into our\nadversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness\ntestimony of questionable reliability.” (Perry v. New Hampshire, supra, 132 S.Ct. at\np. 728.) These safeguards include counsel who “can expose the flaws in the eyewitness’\ntestimony during cross-examination and focus the jury’s attention on the fallibility of\nsuch testimony during opening and closing arguments” (ibid.), as well as expert\ntestimony – both of which safeguards were well employed in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                             123\n\f14. The Flight Instruction\n       The defense objected to the prosecution’s request for an instruction on flight after\ncrime (CALJIC No. 2.52), and requested that, if the instruction were given over the\nobjection, it should be modified. The trial court agreed with the requested modification,\nand instructed the jury as follows: “The flight of a person after the commission of a\ncrime, or after he is accused of a crime, is not sufficient in itself to establish his guilt, but\nis a fact which, if proved, may be considered by you in light of all other proved facts in\ndeciding whether a defendant is guilty or not guilty. Whether or not evidence of flight\nshows a consciousness of guilt and the significance to be attached to such a circumstance,\nare matters for your determination.”\n       Defendant contends it was error to give the flight instruction. We disagree.\n       a. The evidence\n       Karen Dragutin testified (see pt. 2.h. of the facts, ante) to threatening statements\ndefendant made about Mickey Thompson during a dinner conversation in the months\npreceding the murders. These included that “the only way he [defendant] was going to\nget out of it [(the litigation mess)] is if Mickey Thompson died.” Ms. Dragutin said\ndefendant “was talking about a boat and going to Bermuda, and it was still in the context\nof that conversation. So my conclusion was he was going away.”\n       The facts relating to the yacht are recounted in part 5, ante, of the factual\nsummary. In short, defendant’s wife made a deposit for the purchase of a yacht in\nJanuary 1988, received approval of a bank loan for the yacht on March 9, 1988, and\nconsummated the sale in late April or early May. On June 27, 1988, defendant took the\n57-foot yacht, which was outfitted such that two people could live on it for an extended\nperiod of time, to a South Carolina marina for installation of equipment, and the yacht\nwas there for six weeks. In early August, defendant unexpectedly asked the marina\nmanager to expedite the work; the manager did so, and defendant sailed away. In\nMay 1991, the bank holding the mortgage on the yacht hired a boat surveyor to repossess\nthe yacht, and during his efforts to do so, defendant told him by telephone that “he would\n\n\n\n                                               124\n\fnever find his boat.” The surveyor ultimately located the yacht and defendant in\nGuatemala.\n       Detective Griggs testified that he never caused a case to be filed against defendant,\nnever arrested him, and at no time sought to arrest him and could not find him.\n       b. The law\n       “[Penal Code] [s]ection 1127c requires a trial court in any criminal proceeding to\ninstruct as to flight where evidence of flight is relied upon as tending to show guilt.”44\n(People v. Carter (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1182 (Carter).) CALJIC No. 2.52 is derived\nfrom section 1127c. (Carter, at p. 1182.) “In general, a flight instruction ‘is proper\nwhere the evidence shows that the defendant departed the crime scene under\ncircumstances suggesting that his movement was motivated by a consciousness of guilt.’\n[Citations.] Flight requires ‘ “a purpose to avoid being observed or arrested.” ’\n[Citation.]” (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 710 (Avila) [police searched\nunsuccessfully for defendant in 1991 and 1992, and he was ultimately arrested more than\nfour years after the crimes at the Los Angeles International Airport; that was “ ‘sufficient\nevidence to warrant instructing the jury to determine whether flight occurred, and, if so,\nwhat weight to accord such flight’ ”; the instruction “ ‘adequately conveyed the concept\nthat if flight was found, the jury was permitted to consider alternative explanations for\nthat flight other than defendant’s consciousness of guilt’ ”].)\n       CALJIC No. 2.52 does not require “a defined temporal period within which the\nflight must be commenced . . . .” (Carter, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1182 [where defendant\n“left California in the days immediately following the charged offenses” and was in\n\n44      Penal Code section 1127c provides: “In any criminal trial or proceeding where\nevidence of flight of a defendant is relied upon as tending to show guilt, the court shall\ninstruct the jury substantially as follows: [¶] The flight of a person immediately after the\ncommission of a crime, or after he is accused of a crime that has been committed, is not\nsufficient in itself to establish his guilt, but is a fact which, if proved, the jury may\nconsider in deciding his guilt or innocence. The weight to which such circumstance is\nentitled is a matter for the jury to determine. [¶] No further instruction on the subject of\nflight need be given.”\n\n\n                                             125\n\fpossession of a vehicle belonging to the murder victim when he was arrested in Arizona,\nthe flight instruction “plainly was warranted”].) “[A] flight instruction does not create an\nunconstitutional permissive inference or lessen the prosecutor’s burden of proof, and is\nproper even when identity is at issue.” (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 710.)\n       c. Contentions and conclusions\n       Defendant first contends the flight instruction “improperly focused the jury’s\nattention on ‘flight’ evidence where little evidence connected [defendant] to the killings.”\nDefendant’s premise – that little evidence connected him to the crimes – is unsound, and\nthe only authority he cites is not California authority. In California, the flight instruction\nis proper if “ ‘the evidence shows that the defendant departed the crime scene under\ncircumstances suggesting that his movement was motivated by a consciousness of guilt’ ”\n(Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 710), and that is the only pertinent question. The evidence\nwe have described above – relating to the purchase of the yacht, its outfitting, and\ndefendant’s subsequent sailing to parts unknown, along with his statements before the\nmurders “about a boat and going to Bermuda,” in the context of other statements that “the\nonly way he was going to get out of it [(the litigation mess)] is if Mickey Thompson\ndied” – permits the inference that defendant left Los Angeles “ ‘under circumstances\nsuggesting that his movement was motivated by a consciousness of guilt.’ ” (Ibid.)\n       Next, defendant says the instruction was defective because it omitted the word\n“immediate,” which appears in Penal Code section 1127c, and because defendant had not\nbeen accused of the murders when he “went sailing.” There was no defect. The statutory\nlanguage includes the flight of a person both “immediately after the commission of a\ncrime” and “after he is accused of a crime that has been committed . . . .” (§ 1127c.) As\ndefense counsel told the trial court in seeking dismissal of the case, defendant “was a\nnamed suspect within hours of the murder.” And, in any event, CALJIC No. 2.52\n“neither requires knowledge on a defendant’s part that criminal charges have been filed,\nnor a defined temporal period within which the flight must be commenced . . . .” (Carter,\nsupra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1182.)\n\n\n\n                                             126\n\f       Finally, defendant contends the instruction was erroneous because the court\nexcluded evidence that defendant had, through counsel, “offered to make himself\navailable in Los Angeles should his presence be required by investigators – a fact\nvitiating an inference [defendant] ‘fled’ to avoid arrest.” This contention has no merit\neither. First, defendant offers no argument or legal authority to suggest the court’s\nevidentiary ruling was erroneous, and so we need not consider the point. (People v.\nStanley (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793.) Second, there was in any event no error in the\nevidentiary ruling. Defendant is referring to a letter from then-defense counsel Al Stokke\nto Detective Griggs in October 1988, apparently offering to make defendant available in\nLos Angeles if needed. But Mr. Stokke had told police, just a few hours after the\nmurders, and again at a later meeting among Detective Griggs, defendant and Mr. Stokke,\nthat defendant would not make any statement. The trial court ruled that if the defense\nadduced the statement from Mr. Stokke’s letter, the prosecutor could bring out\nMr. Stokke’s previous statement that defendant would not talk to the police; otherwise\nthe jury would be misled into inferring that defendant was cooperating with the police.\nDefense counsel then apparently chose not to adduce the letter or any testimony about it.\nThere was no error in the trial court’s ruling.45\n       Defendant repeatedly contends the flight instruction provided the jury with an\nimproper basis from which to infer defendant “had a culpable mental state at the time of\nthe offense.” But the Supreme Court has repeatedly held otherwise. (People v. Welch\n(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 757 [“ ‘[T]he flight instruction “[does] not address the defendant’s\nmental state at the time of the offense and [does] not direct or compel the drawing of\nimpermissible inferences in regard thereto” ’ ”]; see also People v. Smithey (1999) 20\nCal.4th 936, 983, citing cases.)\n\n\n\n45      “Doyle [v. Ohio (1976) 426 U.S. 610] forbids impeachment of a defendant’s\nexculpatory trial testimony with cross-examination about his or her postarrest silence\nafter receiving Miranda warnings.” (People v. Tate (2010) 49 Cal.4th 635, 691-692.)\nDefendant here had not been arrested when he declined to cooperate with the police.\n\n\n                                             127\n\f         In sum, it is error to instruct on flight when there is no evidence of flight. (People\nv. Kessler (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 812, 815.) Here, there was evidence of flight. Flight\nrequires “ ‘ “a purpose to avoid being observed or arrested” ’ ” (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th\nat p. 710), and the evidence we have described easily permits that factual determination.\n(See Abilez, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 522 [“ ‘the instruction did not assume that flight was\nestablished, leaving that factual determination and its significance to the jury’ ”];\ncf. Carter, supra, 36 Cal.4th at pp. 1182-1183 [“even if we were to conclude the\ninstruction should not have been given, any error would have been harmless. The\ninstruction did not assume that flight was established, but instead permitted the jury to\nmake that factual determination and to decide what weight to accord it”].) There was no\nerror.\n15. The Prosecutorial Misconduct Claims\n         Defendant contends the prosecutor committed numerous acts of prosecutorial\nmisconduct. We do not agree.\n         The Supreme Court has summarized the standards under which we evaluate a\nclaim of prosecutorial misconduct. “A prosecutor’s conduct violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution when it infects the trial with such unfairness as to\nmake the conviction a denial of due process. Conduct by a prosecutor that does not\nrender a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law\nonly if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade\neither the trial court or the jury.” (People v. Morales (2001) 25 Cal.4th 34, 44\n(Morales).)\n         “ ‘ “ ‘[A] prosecutor is given wide latitude during argument. The argument may\nbe vigorous as long as it amounts to fair comment on the evidence, which can include\nreasonable inferences, or deductions to be drawn therefrom. [Citations.]’ . . .\n‘A prosecutor may “vigorously argue his case and is not limited to ‘Chesterfieldian\npoliteness’ ” [citation], and he may “use appropriate epithets . . . .” ’ ” [Citation.] ’\n[Citation.]” (People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 819.) When a prosecutorial\nmisconduct claim focuses on comments the prosecutor made before the jury, “the\n\n                                              128\n\fquestion is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any\nof the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.” (Morales, supra, 25 Cal.4th\nat p. 44.)\n       The defendant may not complain on appeal of the prosecutor’s misconduct unless\nhe timely objected at trial “and also requested that the jury be admonished to disregard\nthe perceived impropriety.” (People v. Thornton (2007) 41 Cal.4th 391, 454.) If the\ndefendant objected, or if an objection would not have cured the harm, we ask whether the\nimproper conduct was prejudicial, that is, whether it is reasonably probable a result more\nfavorable to the defendant would have occurred if the prosecutor had refrained from the\nmisconduct. (People v. Haskett (1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 866.) Prosecutorial misconduct\nrequires reversal under federal law unless the misconduct was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. (People v. Cook (2006) 39 Cal.4th 566, 608.)\n       a. Claims of misconduct in the prosecutor’s opening statement\n       Defendant contends the prosecutor made “numerous bad faith and prejudicial\nstatements” during his opening statement, “promising evidence he failed to produce.” As\nwe address defendant’s often hyperbolic (and sometimes misleading) claims, it is well to\nbear in mind the applicable principles.\n       It is, of course, improper “to make assertions of fact in an opening statement that\nthe prosecutor cannot prove and does not intend to prove . . . .” (5 Witkin, Cal. Criminal\nLaw (4th ed. 2012) Criminal Trial, § 621, p. 963.) “But mere failure to prove every point\nasserted does not amount to prejudicial misconduct,” and “[m]ere discrepancy between\nstatement and proof is not reversible error.” (Ibid.) “[R]emarks made in an opening\nstatement cannot be charged as misconduct unless the evidence referred to by the\nprosecutor ‘was “so patently inadmissible as to charge the prosecutor with knowledge\nthat it could never be admitted.” ’ [Citation.]” (People v. Wrest (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1088,\n1108 (Wrest).) And misconduct in an opening statement “is not grounds for reversal of\nthe judgment on appeal unless the misconduct was prejudicial or the conduct of the\nprosecutor so egregious as to deny the defendant a fair trial.” (People v. Harris (1989)\n47 Cal.3d 1047, 1080.)\n\n                                            129\n\f        In this case, we see no misconduct. As was true in Wrest, “in each case, the\nvariance between prosecutorial statement and actual proof is minor or nonexistent. In no\ncase can an inference of misconduct be drawn.” (Wrest, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 1108.)\n        Defendant cites nine instances of alleged misconduct in the prosecutor’s opening\nstatement.\n               i. The first three claims of misconduct\n        Defendant’s first three claims of misconduct are based on the following portion of\nthe prosecutor’s opening statement. The prosecutor referred to Allison Triarsi and her\nparents, Phyllis and Anthony Triarsi, neighbors who could look down on the crime scene\narea, and said:\n        “And what they will tell you is that after a volley of several gunshots had been\nlevied, presumably against Mickey Thompson – because of the autopsy findings, it’s\npresumable that Mickey Thompson was shot multiple times before the coup d’ gras [sic]\nshot.\n        “As a matter of fact, the evidence will show that’s exactly what happened based\non the witness’s observations. As he stood at the top of the driveway, the other gunman\nshot at the van. The van had several bullet holes in it. Trudy Thompson was either\npulled from or fell out of the van. She then got down to her knees.\n        “The injuries that she sustained indicate the following: she was crawling down the\ndriveway. It is a very, very steep driveway. She was crawling down that driveway for\nher life. All of her acrylic fingernails began breaking off. She was skinning and scraping\nher knees. She was in a dress that day.\n        “The second gunman followed Trudy Thompson all the way down the driveway;\ngun in hand covering her; but he didn’t kill her yet. That will become incredibly\nimportant in this trial. He didn’t kill her yet. Mickey Thompson, though shot several\ntimes – Mickey Thompson ultimately suffered seven separate gunshot wounds.\nSeven. . . .\n        “And he was shot several times in the abdomen; in the hips; in the buttocks;\nthrough the arm. But he was kept alive. And the evidence will show that at any point at\n\n                                            130\n\fany time either of the gunmen could have put Mickey Thompson down like that, one shot\nto the head would do it. But they didn’t. He was disabled, but he was kept alive.\n        “Meanwhile Trudy Thompson was being covered by the other gunman. And once\nthey were in a position that they could see each other and Mickey Thompson could\nclearly watch, the second gunman put the gun to the back of Trudy’s head and fired a\nbullet through her brain. The evidence will show that Mickey Thompson’s last vision on\nthis planet was that of his wife being executed.\n        “[T]he second gunman then screwed that .9 millimeter pistol into the left ear of\nMickey Thompson, literally his left ear and fired a bullet that passed completely through\nhis brain and he was killed. Witnesses saw this, then watched as the gunman jumped on\nbicycles and began to pedal off. . . . ”\n        Based on that opening statement, defendant complains (1) that Phyllis and\nAnthony Triarsi did not testify at trial, and that no witness testified to “[the prosecutor’s]\n‘dance of death.’ ” He also asserts (2) the prosecutor “failed to present any evidence that\n‘Trudy died first’ or the shooter held her head up by her hair before shooting her.” And\nhe contends (3) there was no evidence a gun was “screwed into [Mickey Thompson’s]\nleft ear,” or that he “was shot to incapacitate him but kept alive so he could watch Trudy\ndie.”\n        First, we do not see misconduct in the prosecutor’s mention of Allison Triarsi’s\nparents as anticipated eyewitnesses, along with Miss Triarsi. Nor can we see what\npossible prejudice could flow from a prosecutorial decision to produce only one witness\ninstead of three. And, contrary to defendant’s assertions, the prosecutor said nothing\nabout a “dance of death” in his opening statement.\n        Second, the prosecutor at no point suggested in his argument that “the shooter held\n[Trudy’s] head up by her hair before shooting her.” Defendant’s insinuation that the\nprosecutor said this is incorrect.46\n\n46     Defense counsel, in cross-examination of Lance Johnson, elicited his testimony\nabout this scenario in order to show the witness’s bias. Mr. Johnson admitted that he had\nparticipated in various television shows recreating the crime, and even though he did not\n\n                                             131\n\f       Third, Allison Triarsi’s testimony was substantially consistent with the\nprosecutor’s argument that Mickey Thompson was kept alive to watch his wife die. As\nmore fully described in part 4.a. of the facts, ante, Miss Triarsi testified there was a man\nwith Mickey Thompson who “had a gun and was directing him and making him go in\ncertain directions”; she heard Mickey Thompson saying, over and over, “Please don’t kill\nmy wife,” a statement directed to another man “at the bottom of the driveway who had a\ngun and coming towards Trudy”; it appeared Mickey Thompson was trying to go to his\nwife, and the gunman was “hold[ing] him at bay with an outstretched hand with the gun\nin his hand”; and then the gunman near Trudy shot her in the head. Miss Triarsi testified\nthat she did not remember what the gunman who shot Trudy did next, “because the next\nthing I remember Mickey is getting shot.” This is plainly evidence that “Trudy died\nfirst.” (And, the medical examiner, Dr. Lisa Scheinin, indicated the gunshot wound to\nMr. Thompson’s head was most likely the last of the wounds inflicted on him.)\n       Fourth, as for the prosecutor’s statements that the gunman “screwed that\n.9 millimeter pistol into his left ear and fired a shot through Mickey’s brain,” respondent\nacknowledges this was an overstatement. As Dr. Scheinin testified, there was\n“absolutely” no evidence that anyone “screwed a gun in to [Mickey Thompson’s] ear and\nfired a bullet.” But Dr. Scheinin also testified that the gunshot wound was “consistent\nwith someone putting a weapon close within inches behind Mr. Thompson’s ear and\nfiring it.” We consider this inconsistency between the prosecutor’s opening statement\nand the evidence actually adduced to be inconsequential. (See People v. Dykes (2009)\n46 Cal.4th 731, 761-762 [“the evidence may not have established that the victim died\nlooking at his grandmother, but there was evidence that could support the view that the\nchild was leaning toward his grandmother when he was shot”; any inconsistency was\n\n\n\nwitness the murders, he told the producers on camera that his understanding of how the\ncrime occurred was that Trudy Thompson’s head was held up by the hair, so that Mickey\nThompson could see the killers shoot her in the head, after which they shot\nMr. Thompson.\n\n\n                                             132\n\finconsequential]; cf. Harris, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 1079 [“We reject what appears to be\nan attempt to elevate hyperbole into misconduct.”].)\n       Finally, in his reply brief, defendant claims respondent conceded misconduct by\nfailing to address a claim he made in his opening brief (in connection with his argument\nthat “nobody testified to [the prosecutor’s] ‘dance of death’ ”). Defendant asserted,\nwithout elaboration, that “[n]o witness testified” to the following statement of the\nprosecutor (made while showing photographs of the crime scene and arguing this was a\nprofessional hit, not a robbery, and that the Thompsons could see each other): “All the\nblood Mickey Thompson was losing at the top of the driveway will suggest that he was\ncrawling in circles in this area (indicating),” and “ultimately was shot to death right\nwhere the white sheet is.” Defendant does not explain how this is in any way significant,\nand again, any inconsistency with the evidence is inconsequential. There was no\nmisconduct.\n              ii. The bankruptcy fraud claim\n       In his opening statement, the prosecutor explained that, after defendant declared\nbankruptcy, Mr. Thompson was the most aggressive of defendant’s creditors, and as a\ncreditor he had two options. The prosecutor continued:\n              “And these are important options to understand . . . . [¶] . . .\n       Option 1, pay me what you owe me. That’s all I ask for. You can do\n       whatever you want to with the rest of the creditors. But pay me what you\n       owe me and then go on about your business. . . . [¶] Option 2, pay me\n       what you owe me. And I’m going to show the bankruptcy court that you\n       have engaged in fraud, deceit, lying on the court, and the bankruptcy court\n       won’t discharge any of your debt. [¶] Guess which one Mickey chose?\n       Option 2. That was the objection that Mickey filed with the bankruptcy\n       court. That case was supposed to go to trial on March 18th. Mickey\n       Thompson was killed two days beforehand.”\n       Defendant contends this argument was misconduct because “[t]he prosecutor\nfailed to prove [defendant] committed bankruptcy fraud.” The short answer to this claim\nis that the prosecutor did not say he would prove defendant committed bankruptcy fraud;\nhe said that Mr. Thompson intended to offer proof to the bankruptcy court that defendant\nhad engaged in fraud. And the prosecution presented considerable evidence of\n\n                                            133\n\fdefendant’s improper actions during the bankruptcy. For example, and as more fully\ndescribed in part 1 of the facts, ante, when Jeffrey Coyne was appointed bankruptcy\ntrustee, he discovered “there was no operating company to run,” as “the operating part”\nhad been sold to a company owned and operated by defendant’s wife and another person.\nMr. Coyne found “lots of gaping holes” and determined that the transfer “was all done for\nthe purpose of moving the business without paying the creditors,” the most vocal of\nwhom was Mr. Thompson. Mr. Coyne testified to his belief the activity of defendant, his\nwife, and the entities in the transaction was fraud affecting Mr. Thompson’s rights as a\ncreditor.\n       In short, while defendant was not convicted of bankruptcy fraud – he was\nconvicted of filing false loan documents, a fact never published to the jury – the\nprosecutor did not say otherwise, and there is obviously no misconduct.\n              iii. Deputy John Williams\n       Defendant next cites as misconduct this part of the prosecutor’s opening\nstatement:\n       “I told you about that prized Mercedes, that 1982 SL coupe. Mickey Thompson\nwent after that as a personal asset. It was ultimately seized by authorities. We will\nintroduce you to Deputy John Williams who is now a public official in Orange County;\nno longer a serving officer. But he is a serving public official, an elected official.\n       “He will tell you that when he walked up to notify [defendant] that he was going\nto have to seize his car, he had legal documentation that entitled him, John Williams, to\nseize the car, [defendant] flew into one of his famous violent rages. He flew into a rage.\nHe turned beet red. His neck got thick. Every vein on his face started sticking out. And\nhe screamed, ‘He doesn’t know who he’s fucking with. He’s fucking dead . . . if he\nthinks he’s going to take my car. The car was, in fact, taken.”\n       Defendant cites this as misconduct, saying the prosecutor “failed to prove\n[defendant] made threats in the presence of Deputy John Williams.” He is wrong.\nMr. Williams testified just as the prosecutor said he would. But he also said his best\nrecollection was that the incident occurred in late 1987 or early 1988, while other\n\n                                             134\n\fwitnesses and documentation showed a levy occurred in June or July 1986. Defendant\nsays Mr. Williams’s testimony was “false” because defendant was in bankruptcy since\nthe fall of 1986, so the car could not have been seized in 1987 or 1988 to satisfy\nMr. Thompson’s judgment. But mistaken testimony is not “false” testimony. (Indeed,\nMr. Williams was adamant, even when confronted with evidence that a levy occurred in\n1986, that the incident he described “did not occur in August of 1986,” and that he was\n“never told, even by the defendant, he was in bankruptcy or I wouldn’t have taken his\ncar.”) There is simply no support for defendant’s assertion that the prosecutor “failed to\nprove [defendant] made threats in the presence of Deputy John Williams,” much less that\nthe prosecutor’s opening statement was “knowingly false and made in bad faith” and a\n“deliberate misstatement.” There was no misconduct.\n              iv. Allegedly false promises of testimony\n       Next, defendant makes several claims that the prosecutor “falsely promised”\ntestimony or evidence that was not presented.\n       First, defendant again returns to the prosecutor’s statement (see pt. i, ante) about\nthe bullet through Mickey Thompson’s brain, killing him. The prosecutor continued:\n“Witnesses that saw this, then watched as the gunman [sic] jumped on bicycles and began\nto pedal off.” Defendant complains that “[n]obody testified to seeing the gunmen jump\non bicycles and pedal off.” That is true, but inconsequential. Witnesses heard the\ngunfire, and just after that Lance Johnson saw two men on bicycles riding down the\nThompson driveway towards Woodlyn Lane. And Allison Triarsi heard the clicking of\nthe bicycles, “[l]ike a ten speed bike,” moving the back way out of the Thompson\nproperty. Plainly, “the variance between prosecutorial statement and actual proof is\nminor” and an inference of misconduct cannot be drawn. (Wrest, supra, 3 Cal.4th at\np. 1108.)\n       Next, defendant asserts the prosecutor “falsely promised” the evidence would\nshow defendant planned the murders, “but no such evidence was presented.” This is a\nfrivolous contention as to which defendant does not elaborate, and we do not consider it\nfurther.\n\n                                            135\n\f       Defendant also asserts misconduct in the final lines of the prosecutor’s opening\nstatement, where the prosecutor said: “He [(defendant)] would see that Mickey\nThompson was killed before he ever got a dime of his [(defendant’s)] money. And how\ndo we know that? Because we got it from the absolute, most reliable source.\n[Defendant] said so.” This is misconduct, defendant says, because “no confession was\npresented to the jury.” This claim is nonsense. The prosecutor did not claim that\ndefendant confessed. The prosecutor presented testimony from Gregory Keay that\ndefendant said “Mickey was out to get all of his money and before that would happen, he\nwould have him wasted.” And Joel Weissler testified that he heard defendant tell\nMr. Thompson, “You will never see a cent of it. I’m going to hurt you and your family.”\nThat is just what the prosecutor said, and defendant’s claim to the contrary is\ndisingenuous at best.\n       Finally, defendant asserts misconduct in the prosecutor’s statement that: “And\nthrough this whole thing every single witness, every witness who heard anything, from\nthe Johnsons to the Hackmans to the Triarsis, every witness that heard anything heard the\nsame thing from Mickey Thompson. . . . Mickey Thompson repeated over and over,\n‘Please, please don’t hurt my wife.’ ” Defendant points out that the Hackmans did not\ntestify, and neither did the Triarsi parents. Again, this is inconsequential. Three of the\nwitnesses mentioned did testify, and they all said what the prosecutor said they would\nsay. As noted above, we do not see misconduct in the mention of anticipated witnesses\nwho are not produced, when other witnesses provide the promised testimony. There was\nno misconduct.\n              v. Ronald Stevens’s photo identification\n       In his opening statement, the prosecutor talked about Ronald and Tonyia Stevens\nseeing defendant outside their home and their report of that incident to the police years\nlater. The prosecutor continued: “Ron Stevens was asked if he would look at a series of\nphotographs first. He said, sure, I’ll look at a series of photographs and see if I can\nidentify the person. He looked at the photographs and he pointed to a particular picture.”\n\n\n\n                                             136\n\f       Defendant contends this was misconduct, because the prosecutor “knew at the\ntime he made this statement it was false because he possessed a recording of that\nidentification procedure, during which Ron indicated he was unable to narrow his choice\ndown to fewer than three men . . . .”\n       We cannot find misconduct on this record. Mr. Stevens testified that when he was\nshown the photographs, he “was asked if [he] recognized anyone in the picture as being\nthe person in that car,” and he said, “Yes, I did.” He said he recognized “No. 3, the top\nright corner,” and that was defendant. Mr. Stevens was then asked on cross-examination,\n“Do you recall . . . that you actually weren’t really able to draw it to No. 3, you actually\nnarrowed it down to three out of the six?” and he replied, “No, I don’t.” The defense\nthen played audio recordings in court of portions of the photographic identification\nprocedure. A transcript of the audio recording (defense exhs. Z-1 & AA-1) shows\nMr. Stevens saying, “[I]t was this color of hair but it was this type of nose, but was that\ntype of complexion. I couldn’t be positive,” and, “Well, these three look similar,” and\n“1, 5 and 3 . . . look similar.” Detective Lillienfeld then says, “Yeah, but the guy you saw\nin the wagon that day most resembles who in this photo array now?” Mr. Stevens replies,\n“Number 3 or . . . [¶] Oh, okay. [¶] 1, 5 or 3 would be – if I saw them in person.”\n       The prosecutor’s opening statement was completely consistent with Mr. Stevens’s\ntestimony and, while the transcript shows uncertainty (which is why, as defendant points\nout, Detective Lillienfeld suggested a live lineup), it apparently also shows defendant did\npoint to defendant’s photo. In any event, there could be “‘no conceivable prejudice’”\nwhere defendant was able to confront Mr. Stevens and challenge his testimony as\ndefendant did here. (See Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 762.)\n              vi. Assertions of false representations\n       Defendant next makes three claims of allegedly false assertions or promises in the\nopening statement.\n       First, in describing defendant’s financial actions shortly before the murders, the\nprosecutor said: “[Defendant] had been hiding a series of investments in his wife Diane’s\nname. You’ll see the name Diane Goodwin. But we will also introduce evidence that\n\n                                             137\n\fshows beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant] was doing that on purpose. Why? To\nhide his assets from Mickey Thompson; to hide those assets from the Bankruptcy Court;\nand to set in motion his escape plan when he killed Mickey. [¶] He sold Whitehawk\ninvestments. And then another investment Desert Investors was also in Diane Goodwin’s\nname. Within days of the first sale, he sold all of his interest in those, the second one. So\nwhat did he do with all this money?”\n       Defendant contends the prosecutor “falsely asserted ‘[defendant] sold Whitehawk\ninvestments,” because the evidence showed “Whitehawk was never sold.” This is\nanother completely inconsequential point. It is true the Whitehawk investment itself was\nnot “sold.” (Dolores Cordell testified it was a real estate investment and she sought to\nbring returns from that investment into the bankruptcy estate; she testified she was able to\nbring the Whitehawk asset into the estate because she showed “the investment itself . . .\nbelonged in the estate.”) But in substance, the prosecutor showed what he said he would\nshow: the Whitehawk investment was purchased with commingled funds of the\nGoodwins, but then distributions from the Whitehawk investment in 1988 were made in\nthe name of Diane Goodwin. The parties stipulated there was a check for $365,000\npayable to Diane Goodwin from J.G.A. Group dated May 6, 1988, containing the\nnotation, “distribution from Whitehawk cashier’s check.” And Karen Stephens-Kingdon\ntestified that $300,000 of that $365,000 was transferred to Diane Goodwin’s account in\nanother bank; some $275,000 of that money was used to purchase gold coins, and another\n$10,000 was wired offshore. That this money was from a distribution and not a sale is\nunimportant. There was no misconduct.\n       Second, defendant cites as misconduct the prosecutor’s use of the words\n“skimming” and “stolen” in his description of defendant’s actions that precipitated\nMickey Thompson’s lawsuit. The prosecutor described the inception of the dispute:\nMr. Thompson had to “front more cash and more cash” for the venture’s first racing\nevent, despite defendant’s obligation to furnish 70 percent of the capital. The prosecutor\ncontinued: “The evidence will show the reason Mickey Thompson was fronting all the\nmoney is because [defendant] was cheating him. He was [siphoning] money off the top;\n\n                                            138\n\fskimming money off the top of the company; and skimming money out of the pocket of\nMickey Thompson.” So Mr. Thompson sued him, and obtained a judgment of almost\n$800,000. The prosecutor said the judge found that in eight months of doing business\ntogether, defendant “had stolen over $500,000 – $512,000 to be exact – from Mickey\nThompson.”\n       Defendant cites testimony that the issues in the dispute were over defendant’s\nrefusal to advance cash to put on events and his plan that Mr. Thompson “would have no\nsay in, or revenue from, the operations,” and that there was an issue raised of contract\ninterpretation. These issues, defendant asserts, “do not amount to ‘skimming’ or\n‘stealing.’ ” Perhaps not, in a technical legal sense. But when one business partner\nrefuses to contribute his agreed 70 percent share, jeopardizing the racing event and thus\nforcing the other partner to put up the money (not to mention planning that\nMr. Thompson would have no revenues from the operation of their companies), it is hard\nnot to think of this conduct, in the colloquial sense, as stealing. The prosecutor’s\nlanguage was well within the “ ‘broad scope of permissible argument.’ ” (Dykes, supra,\n46 Cal.4th at p. 762 [rejecting contention that language in opening statement describing\nthe defendant in an unflattering light was misconduct; the comments “were based upon\nevidence to be presented at the trial . . . and were within the ‘broad scope of permissible\nargument’ ”].) (Defendant’s assertion in his reply brief that “Dykes was wrongly\ndecided” requires no comment from us.)\n       Third, defendant asserts misconduct in the prosecutor’s statement that “the\nevidence in this case will show that [defendant] was never ever, ever going to pay\nMickey Thompson what he owed him.” Defendant says the evidence showed that in the\nweeks before the murders, defendant’s and Mr. Thompson’s attorneys had worked out a\nsettlement, and defendant signed that settlement agreement after the Thompsons were\nmurdered. This, defendant says, makes the prosecutor’s statement “false[].” On the\ncontrary, the evidence presented reasonably could be viewed just as the prosecutor said.\nDolores Cordell testified that defendant repeatedly expressed his willingness to accept\nsettlement terms, only to renege at the last minute. The testimony defendant\n\n                                            139\n\fcharacterizes as showing that the settlement “would have paid Thompson the entire\njudgment” actually was that the settlement said “basically that Mickey Thompson’s debt\nwould not be dischargeable in the bankruptcy.” Defendant signed the settlement after the\nmurders, and Phillip Bartinetti testified that “to this day” the judgment has never been\npaid by defendant. No misconduct is shown.\n              vii. The Insport agreement\n       As the prosecutor described it, the so-called “Insport agreement” was a contract\nthat gave the signatory the unique ability to put on motor sports races with certain drivers\nin certain venues. Defendant was a signatory to the Insport agreement, which was worth\n“tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars to the holder” of the\ncontract. In his opening statement, the prosecutor said: “In order to try to satisfy his\njudgment, Mickey Thompson went after the Insport agreement. [Defendant] fought it.\n[Defendant] lost.”\n       Defendant contends the last quoted statement was one of “numerous falsehoods”\nin the prosecutor’s opening statement. He tells us the evidence showed (1) the Insport\nagreement became an asset of the bankruptcy estate and was put up for bid; (2) Diane\nGoodwin and Charles Clayton were the highest bidders, not Mr. Thompson, (3) “so it\nwas not true that [defendant] ‘lost’ the Insport agreement to Thompson.” The first part of\ndefendant’s description of the evidence is correct, but his conclusion is incorrect.\n       The Goodwin/Clayton enterprise (SXI, of which defendant was president) was the\nhighest bidder for the Insport agreement, and purchased it with Bankruptcy Court\npermission. But SXI failed to make all the payments due to the Bankruptcy Court for the\nInsport agreement, and the trustee began taking steps to repossess it. Dolores Cordell\ntestified that in December 1987, there was a hearing, and the court “essentially put the\nInsport agreement up to bid again.” According to Ms. Cordell, several parties bid,\nincluding the Goodwins, and Mickey Thompson won that bid. Ms. Cordell’s recollection\nwas that he paid $500,000, in December 1987. (The trustee also testified that at no point\nduring his tenure as the bankruptcy trustee did defendant ever own the Insport agreement\n“free and clear.”) This evidence clearly supports the prosecutor’s statement that “Mickey\n\n                                            140\n\fThompson went after the Insport agreement,” and “[Defendant] fought it. [Defendant]\nlost.” Defendant’s claim that Ms. Cordell “had to admit she was wrong” is not borne out\nby the record. There was clearly no misconduct.\n      b. The claimed violation of a court order\n      Defendant sought to prevent the prosecutor from eliciting any testimony about\nbankruptcy fraud in connection with defendant’s conduct during the bankruptcy\nproceedings. (In federal proceedings, defendant had been charged with many counts of\nbankruptcy fraud and filing false loan documents, but was convicted only of filing false\nloan documents.) Thus, defendant objected to bankruptcy trustee Jeffrey Coyne\nexpressing any opinion about whether the transfer of assets from defendant’s company\n(ESI) to his wife’s enterprise (SXI) during the bankruptcy was fraudulent. The trial court\noverruled that objection, but ordered the prosecutor to “stay away from fraudulent\nactivity as separate criminal conduct.” Before Karen Stephens-Kingdon testified about\nthe Goodwins’ financial transactions, defense counsel again asserted there should be no\nreference to bankruptcy fraud, and the prosecutor agreed there would be no mention of\nbankruptcy fraud.\n      The prosecutor scrupulously complied with the court’s order. Nonetheless,\ndefendant asserts that the prosecutor “repeatedly used the words ‘fraud’ and ‘fraudulent’\nwhen questioning witnesses about the bankruptcy proceedings,” and says “[t]his was\nmisconduct.” In fact, defendant’s record citations for this claim of misconduct are\ncompletely devoid of any instance of the prosecutor’s use of the words “fraud” or\n“fraudulent.” The prosecutor used the word “fraud” once –in an instance not cited by\ndefendant – when he asked Mr. Bartinetti whether Mr. Thompson, when he objected to\ndefendant’s discharge in bankruptcy, was “claiming fraud and/or deceit on the part of\n[defendant].” (Defense counsel’s objection on grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation\nwas sustained.) Indeed, our review of the record shows the only reference by the\nwitnesses to “fraud” came from Mr. Coyne, when the prosecutor asked him how he\nwould describe “the activity between [defendant]; his wife Diane Goodwin; E.S.I.; S.X.I.;\nChuck Clayton; and the Insport agreement,” and Mr. Coyne answered, “I hate to use the\n\n                                           141\n\f‘F’ word, but fraud.”47 As noted above, this testimony (not cited by defendant) was\nspecifically permitted by the court. The witnesses properly testified to events that\noccurred during the bankruptcy proceedings and to defendant’s financial dealings.\n       In short, defendant’s claim that the prosecutor’s “obfuscation regarding ‘fraud’\nwas intended to confuse the jurors and convince them [defendant] had committed crimes\nin connection with the bankruptcies” has no basis whatsoever in the record.\n       c. The claim of prosecutorial misconduct by leading witnesses\n       Defendant contends the prosecutors “constantly engaged in leading” their\nwitnesses and asserts this was prejudicial misconduct. He cites some 100 objections over\nthe course of 20 days of trial testimony, about three quarters of which were sustained.\nDefendant also refers to several instances where the trial court cautioned the prosecutors\nabout leading questions, but refused to admonish the jury that this was prosecutorial\nmisconduct. Thus:\n       After the court sustained an objection to a leading question during the prosecutor’s\nexamination of Mr. Bartinetti, defense counsel asked the court to cite the prosecutor for\nmisconduct. The court replied: “Well, I have continued to sustain defense objections,”\nbut the court would “not cite anyone for misconduct right now, but simply admonish that\nthe People try to pose the questions in a nonleading fashion. And if it continues, we may\nget to that step, but we’re not anywhere close to that yet.” The court said, “the objections\nhave been I think well taken on the leading aspect of several witnesses already. And I, at\nthis point, just want the record to reflect that you are being asked to avoid leading\nquestions.” And later, still with Mr. Bartinetti, “Let’s stay away from leading questions,\nplease.”\n       During questioning of Dolores Cordell, after the court sustained an objection, the\nprosecutor asked for a sidebar. The court said to the prosecutor: “You know, there has\n\n\n47    There was another reference by Mr. Coyne to issues in a pleading in the\nbankruptcy court that included “avoidance of fraudulent transfers,” but this testimony\nwas specifically elicited by defense counsel, not the prosecutor.\n\n\n                                            142\n\fbeen a consistent problem with maybe your definition of leading and my definition of\nleading. I think a lot of these questions have been leading and that’s why I have been\nsustaining the objections. I denied the request for any kind of misconduct citation\nbecause I don’t believe this is intentional on your part. I think we have an honest\ndisagreement as to the form of the question.”\n       Later, at a sidebar on several subjects during Ronald Stevens’s testimony, the\ncourt denied defense counsel’s request to admonish the jury about improper leading\nquestions, “[f]or right now . . . .” The court refused a similar defense request during\nAllison Triarsi’s testimony. During Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s expert testimony, the\ncourt observed that “I’ve been troubled by the leading questions. I’m not saying that the\nleading questions are necessarily improper. But it’s difficult for me to understand exactly\nwhat you’re asking for if you’re supplying the information. [¶] I mean I would rather\nhear from the witness. The witness is clearly an expert. . . . [¶] I know I would feel\nmore comfortable and I think it would be more helpful if the questions were not so\nsuggestive and so leading.”\n       Based on these objections and the court’s rulings, defendant gives two examples\nof purportedly prejudicial leading questions on key issues in the case. One was a\nquestion to Ronald Stevens (who identified defendant as the man with binoculars in the\ncar outside his house a few days before the murders). Pointing to defendant, the\nprosecutor asked, “Would you describe [defendant’s] complexion as ruddy and pock\nmarked?” But before the prosecutor asked that leading question, he had already elicited\ntestimony from Mr. Stevens about defendant’s complexion. Mr. Stevens had testified\nthat he described the man to the police as “a big man with reddish colored hair and a\nruddy complexion.” In addition, the prosecutor had asked Mr. Stevens, “What did you\nmean when you said he had a ruddy complex [sic]?” Mr. Stevens answered, “It’s\nsomeone that has like pock marks or something when they were young and as they got\nolder it was just a ruddy type of complexion.” In short, the prosecutor’s subsequent\nquestion was leading, but it was not misconduct.\n\n\n\n                                            143\n\f       Defendant’s second example was a question to Allison Triarsi, after she had\ntestified that she was very familiar with the Thompson driveway: “From your\n[perspective] where you – from your view, I should say, was it your impression – being\nfamiliar with that driveway – that Mickey Thompson was in a position to see Trudy\nThompson?” Defense counsel objected and asked for a sidebar; no answer was given to\nthe question (and the court did not rule on the objection). At the sidebar, the court\nrefused to cite the prosecutor’s leading questions as prosecutorial misconduct and refused\nto admonish the jury, saying: “The jurors know that when I sustain the objection, that\nI’m finding that the question is improper. And they were preinstructed as to not to view\nthe question as evidence and not to speculate as to what the answer might be. I think that\nmessage has been made quite loud and clear because the objections have been continuing\nthroughout the trial. And they have all, just about, been sustained.” After the sidebar, the\nprosecutor asked Miss Triarsi about the view of a person standing in the driveway where\nMickey Thompson was, and she testified that “he could easily look down unobstructedly\nand see Trudy.” We do not see any misconduct – and certainly nothing prejudicial – in\nthe prosecutor’s original question.\n       Further, the only cases defendant cites to support his misconduct claim are cases\nthat say it is misconduct deliberately to elicit inadmissible and prejudicial testimony.\nThat did not happen in this case. (See People v. Hayes (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 459, 470\n[“we do not perceive such method of questioning [leading questions] to constitute\nprejudicial misconduct in the absence of any showing that such examination had the\neffect of deliberately producing inadmissible evidence or called for inadmissible and\nprejudicial answers”; the questions complained of “did not produce inadmissible\nevidence or prejudicial answers, but evidence that could properly have been elicited by\nquestions not objectionable in form”]; cf. People v. Hinton (2006) 37 Cal.4th 839, 865\n[the prosecutor’s argumentative and speculative questions during cross-examination of\nthe defendant “were not improper ‘over and above being in violation of the Evidence\nCode’ ”].)\n\n\n\n                                            144\n\f       d. The claim of misconduct in closing argument\n       Defendant asserts there were six instances of prosecutorial misconduct in closing\nargument. Again we disagree.\n              i. The claim the prosecutor misstated the burden of proof\n       Defendant’s first claim of misconduct in closing argument is that the prosecutor\n“repeatedly misstated the burden of proof” by arguing “a ‘totality of the circumstances’\nburden of proof of a conspiracy, and as the standard for proving that [defendant]\nmurdered the Thompsons.” Defendant made no objection during the argument, but\nafterward asked the court to reread the reasonable doubt instruction, contending that the\nprosecutor implied that defendant “was responsible as if this were somehow a civil case.”\nWe find no misconduct, as the prosecutor’s argument, read as a whole, was both clear\nand correct on the burden of proof. (See People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 522\n[“we must view the statements in the context of the argument as a whole”].)\n       In the challenged statements, the prosecutor was explaining the theories of liability\n(aiding and abetting and conspiracy). In discussing aiding and abetting, the prosecutor\nobserved that defendant “does not have to have been at the crime scene. As long as you\nare convinced that [defendant] is responsible in any way shape, form or fashion for the\nmurders of Mickey Thompson and Trudy Thompson, he is liable for everything that the\nactual killers did.” Then the prosecutor talked about conspiracy, telling the jury that\nconspiracy, though uncharged, was important, because every member of a conspiracy is\nliable for the conduct of the others. So “if you find that he was a conspirator, if you find\nthat he was responsible and there was some agreement to kill Mickey Thompson and\nTrudy Thompson,” then “it’s just as if” defendant shot them. The prosecutor continued:\n       “The formation in existence of a conspiracy can be proved through circumstantial\nevidence and the circumstances surrounding the totality of the evidence.\n       “In other words, you don’t have to dissect this case to figure out if there is a\nconspiracy to commit murder. You can look at the totality of the circumstances. As a\nmatter of fact, the jury instruction tells you to do exactly that. These two men, the two\nkillers were acting in concert with one another.\n\n                                             145\n\f       “It was well timed, well coordinated and almost perfectly executed. The killers\ngot away. You can infer from that, you have to infer from that the only reasonable\nexplanation is they were working together. These aren’t two people who happened upon\nthe same house at the same time and just happened to kill Mickey and Trudy Thompson.\n       “Everybody agrees these people were obviously working together. There was an\nagreement there. And if the totality of the circumstances suggest that Michael Goodwin\nis responsible for the killings of Mickey and Trudy Thompson, then Michael Goodwin is\na conspirator along with the two actual killers.”\n       After explaining it was not necessary to prove that defendant knew or met with the\nkillers, the prosecutor said, “As long as the totality of the circumstances proves that\n[defendant] was responsible for the murders of Mickey and Trudy Thompson, we don’t\nhave to show that he even knew the killers. As long as you agree and are convinced that\nthis was a concerted act on all parties.” Then the prosecutor explained that unanimity\nwas not necessary on the theory of liability, saying that some jurors could decide\ndefendant was an aider and abetter and others could say, “you know what, I’m absolutely\nconvinced there was a conspiracy and [defendant] was part of it.” And: “There does not\nhave to be unanimity among you with regard to the theory of liability as long as\neverybody is convinced that [defendant] is responsible for the murders of Mickey and\nTrudy Thompson . . . .”\n       Immediately following those remarks, the prosecutor said: “I want to say just a\ncouple of words about beyond a reasonable doubt. That’s the instruction that puts upon\nus the burden. And I will tell you right now, [defense counsel] and the defense team has\nno burden in this case. . . . [¶] [T]he system of justice . . . says that the prosecution bears\nthe entire burden of proof. And that burden is to prove the criminal case beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Every element of it. I accept that. I . . . embrace that. The defense\ndoesn’t have to prove anything.” The prosecutor then spoke about the meaning of\nreasonable doubt, and concluded: “So ask yourselves based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, do you have an abiding conviction that [defendant] is responsible in any\nway for the murders of Mickey Thompson and Trudy Thompson? If so, we’ve proved\n\n                                             146\n\fthis case to you to an abiding conviction, beyond a reasonable doubt.” The prosecutor\nalso told the jury that the case could be proved by circumstantial evidence, and that “as\nlong as you’re convinced through both circumstantial and direct evidence or one or the\nother that [defendant] is responsible for the deaths of Mickey and Trudy Thompson,\nthat’s all that’s required.”\n       After the argument was completed, defense counsel asked the court to reread the\nburden of proof instruction, and specifically to instruct the jury that “responsibility” is a\ncivil term, and “responsibility only plays a part in a civil hearing.” The court disagreed,\nexplaining that “the context of the argument was [defendant] wasn’t there. He was\nresponsible as an aider and abetter and a co-conspirator. And that’s how I think the jury\nwould interpret that comment.” The statement “was with reference to [vicarious] liability\nhere. And that is the essence of the prosecution’s case. I’m happy to reread the burden\nof proof instruction.”\n       It is apparent from the trial court’s comments and from a review of the entire\nargument – rather than the snippets quoted by defendant – that there was no misstatement\nof the burden of proof.\n               ii. Claims of improper exploitation of excluded evidence\n       Defendant asserts it was misconduct for the prosecutor to “exploit” the court’s\nexclusion of evidence of third party culpability and Joey Hunter’s polygraphs (see pts. 9\n& 11, ante) and the exclusion of evidence the killings were the result of a robbery gone\nbad (Mr. Thompson’s purchase of gold a few days before the murders) (see pt. 10, ante).\nDefendant asserts the two prosecutors devoted much of their closing arguments to the\nlack of evidence that anyone other than defendant hated Mr. Thompson enough to kill\nhim, and to the lack of evidence of a robbery.\n       Thus, for example, the prosecutor argued that “the only evidence you have heard\nin this trial” was evidence that pointed to “only one person who hated Mickey Thompson\nso much that he wanted to end his life. And make sure that Mickey Thompson saw the\nperson he loved the most die in front of him before he died. And that is [defendant].”\nAnd: “[T]here is really an important concept here as we talk about this. And that is,\n\n                                             147\n\fwhat is reasonable and what is unreasonable? What is evidence and what is speculation?\nWhen you hear someone say, well, you know, it could have been. It could have been a\nrobbery. There could have been a video camera there. They are asking you – [defense\ncounsel] is asking you to speculate as to what might have been. As to some evidence that\ndoesn’t exist. Could have been.” Defendant cites many other instances of similar\narguments in the prosecutor’s closing, and concludes that it was “nothing short of\noutrageous” for the prosecutor to “unfairly [take] advantage of the judge’s rulings.”\n       This claim of misconduct is without merit. First, the claim is forfeited because\ndefendant did not make any objection at trial. (Thornton, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 454.)\nSecond, the authorities defendant cites do not support his contention that, in effect, it is\nmisconduct for a prosecutor to argue his case based on the state of the evidence in the\nrecord.\n       Misconduct may occur if the court, at the prosecutor’s behest, erroneously\nexcludes evidence that should have been admitted, and the prosecutor knowingly lies to\nor otherwise misleads the jury. People v. Varona (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 566 (Varona)\ndemonstrates the point. In that case, the defendants, charged with rape and other crimes\nand defending based on the alleged victim’s consent, tried to introduce evidence that the\ncomplaining witness had earlier pled guilty to prostitution and was on probation at the\ntime of trial. The trial court excluded that evidence, and then the prosecutor argued to the\njury that there was no evidence the woman was a prostitute – even though he “knew he\nwas arguing a falsehood.” (Id. at pp. 569-570.) The Court of Appeal found it was error\nto exclude the evidence, and also agreed with the defendant’s contention “that it was\nmisconduct for the prosecutor to argue that there was no proof that the woman was a\nprostitute when he had, by his objections, prevented the defense from proving that fact.”\n(Id. at p. 569.) The court explained: “[I]n a proper case, a prosecutor may argue to a jury\nthat a defendant has not brought forth evidence to corroborate an essential part of his\ndefensive story. But we know of no case where such argument is permissible except\nwhere a defendant might reasonably be expected to produce such corroboration. Here the\nprosecutor not only argued the ‘lack’ of evidence where the defense was ready and\n\n                                             148\n\fwilling to produce it, but he compounded that tactic by actually arguing that the woman\nwas not a prostitute although he had seen the official records and knew that he was\narguing a falsehood. The whole argument went beyond the bounds of any acceptable\nconduct.” (Id. at p. 570.)\n       Similarly, in People v. Daggett (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 751 (Daggett), the court\nerroneously excluded evidence that the child molestation victim (who himself had been\ncharged with molesting younger children) had reported previously being molested by\npersons other than defendant. The error “was compounded when the prosecutor argued\nto the jurors that if they believed [the victim] molested other children, he must have\nlearned that behavior from being molested by [the defendant].” (Id. at p. 757.) The\nerroneously excluded evidence was intended to refute that very argument, and the court\nfound the prosecutor misled the jury by making the argument and “unfairly took\nadvantage of the [court’s] ruling.” (Id. at p. 758.)\n       This case bears no similarity to the cited cases. This is not a case where the court\nexcluded evidence that should have been admitted. Nor did the prosecutor “argu[e] a\nfalsehood” or mislead the jury or unfairly take advantage of an erroneous ruling. The\nprosecutor properly argued his case, based on the state of the evidence in the record, that\nthis was a contract hit, not a robbery, and there was “only one person who hated Mickey\nThompson so much that he wanted to end his life.” There was no misconduct. (See\nPeople v. Lawley (2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 156 [finding Varona and Daggett inapposite\nbecause they involved “erroneous evidentiary rulings on which the prosecutor improperly\ncapitalized”; “[b]ecause the prosecutor’s argument constituted fair comment on the\nevidence, following evidentiary rulings we have upheld, there was no misconduct”].)\n              iii. Claimed references to facts not in evidence\n       It is misconduct to refer in argument to “matter outside the record.” (People v.\nPinholster (1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 948.) Defendant claims the prosecutor argued facts not\nin evidence when he said these things:\n       “Mickey Thompson stood on the top of the driveway and watched in horror as the\nlove of his life, Trudy Thompson, had a bullet put through the back of her head.”\n\n                                             149\n\f       “Mickey Thompson was executed on March 16th, 1988, at 6:05 in the morning,\nbut not before he had to watch his wife, his family, suffer and die. Exactly how\n[defendant] said he wanted it to happen. Exactly.”48\n       “[Defendant] lost the Insport agreement. [Defense counsel] might stand up and\nsay, well, there is no proof that Mickey Thompson got it. Who cares who got it. All we\ncare about is who lost it. [Defendant] lost it.”\n       “Within weeks [they] sold all of Diane Goodwin’s interest in Whitehawk. But\nDiane Goodwin’s interest in Whitehawk was really [defendant’s] interest in Whitehawk.\nHe had been hiding assets in her name or attempting to hide assets in her name and he\ndumped them all.”\n\n       This claim of misconduct, too, is without merit. Defendant made no objection to\nany of these statements at trial, so the claim is forfeited. (Thornton, supra, 41 Cal.4th at\np. 454.) In any event, these misconduct claims have no merit. They are essentially\nduplicates of points we have found to be without merit in connection with similar claims\nof misconduct in the prosecutor’s opening statement. (See our discussion in pt. 15.a.i.,\npt. 15.a.vi., and pt. 15.a.vii, ante.) The only different claim of misconduct is that, after\nsaying that Mr. Thompson had to watch his wife die, the prosecutor said: “Exactly how\n[defendant] said he wanted it to happen. Exactly.” Defendant points out that no one\ntestified to defendant’s making such a statement. Defendant is literally correct, in that\nthere is no evidence defendant said he wanted Mickey Thompson to watch his wife die.\nBut there was evidence defendant specifically said, on two different occasions, that he\nwas “going to hurt you and your family,” “I’ll get you. I’m going to hurt you,” and “I’m\ngoing to hurt your family.” In short, we consider the prosecutor’s remark fair comment\non the evidence, not misconduct. (People v. Ward (2005) 36 Cal.4th 186, 215 (Ward)\n[“ ‘ “[A] prosecutor is given wide latitude during argument. The argument may be\n\n48     Defendant also cites, but does not quote, other parts of the closing argument that\nhe describes as saying that “Trudy had to die first.” Presumably defendant refers to these\nstatements: “That first killer making sure that Trudy was dead and Mickey was still alive\nto watch it,” and “[t]hey couldn’t kill Mickey first because Trudy had to die.”\n\n                                             150\n\fvigorous as long as it amounts to fair comment on the evidence, which can include\nreasonable inferences, or deductions to be drawn therefrom.” ’ ”].)\n              iv. Claimed misrepresentation of bankruptcy law\n       Defendant next cites as misconduct the prosecutor’s argument at pages 8783-8784\nof the trial transcript, saying that argument “misrepresented the law of bankruptcy” in\norder to make his case that defendant’s motive and intention was to avoid paying his civil\njudgment. In that part of the prosecutor’s argument – which defendant does not quote –\nthe prosecutor explained that, after the yacht loan was approved, and shortly after the\nmurders, the Goodwins’ house went into escrow; assets defendant had been trying to hide\nin his wife’s name were turned into cash; and cash was turned into gold and moved\noffshore.\n       First, no objection was made at trial, and the claim is forfeited. Second, we fail to\nsee how that argument “misstat[ed] the law of bankruptcy.” Defendant presents no\ncomprehensible argument or citation of authority for this point, so we do not consider it\nfurther. To the extent this is another version of defendant’s claim that the prosecutor\nviolated the court’s order to “stay away from fraudulent activity as separate criminal\nconduct,” or that there should be no mention of bankruptcy fraud in connection with\nKaren Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony, we have already found, in part 15.b., ante, that the\nprosecutor fully complied with the order.\n              v. Vouching for witnesses\n       The prosecutor “is generally precluded from vouching for the credibility of her\nwitnesses, or referring to evidence outside the record to bolster their credibility or attack\nthat of the defendant.” (People v. Anderson (1990) 52 Cal.3d 453, 479.) Thus a\nprosecutor is not permitted “ ‘to place the prestige of [his] office behind a witness by\noffering the impression that [he] has taken steps to assure a witness’s truthfulness at trial.\n[Citation.] However, so long as a prosecutor’s assurances regarding the apparent honesty\nor reliability of prosecution witnesses are based on the “facts of [the] record and the\ninferences reasonably drawn therefrom, rather than any purported personal knowledge or\n\n\n\n                                             151\n\fbelief,” [his] comments cannot be characterized as improper vouching. [Citations.]’\n[Citation.]” (Ward, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 215.)\n         Defendant contends the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of John Williams\nwhen he said the following, in rebuttal to defense counsel’s argument about\nMr. Williams’s testimony (including that the prosecutors “knew that John Williams was\nlying” and that “John Williams is just simply delusional”): “[Defense counsel] went on\nand on [about John Williams]. And I think she said that John Williams was delusional.\n[¶] Please as we talk this morning I’m going to ask you a number of times to think back\nand remember witnesses and how they testified on the stand. John Williams is an elected\nofficial in Orange County. A long time public servant. At the time of the repossession of\nthe car, he was a deputy marshal in Orange County. . . . [¶] I don’t think anyone in this\ncourtroom would argue with it, his dates were probably off by a year or so.” After\ndescribing his testimony, the prosecutor continued: “You saw this man on the stand.\nYou’ll have to make that judgment. But I would submit to you that what he told you and\nhow this went down and what [defendant] said about Mickey Thompson is absolutely\ntrue.”\n         Once again, defense counsel posed no objection to the prosecutor’s remarks at\ntrial, so the claim of misconduct is forfeited. In any event, the prosecutor’s statements\nwere not improper vouching. Defendant says the prosecutor was “vouching about\nWilliams’ status as an elected official and a marshal,” and “expressed his personal belief\nin Williams’ credibility.” But Mr. Williams testified that he was elected as the Orange\nCounty Public Administrator, and that he had been a deputy marshal, so the prosecutor’s\nremarks about his status were “ ‘based on the “facts of [the] record . . . rather than any\npurported personal knowledge or belief,” ’ ” so that comment “ ‘cannot be characterized\nas improper vouching.’ ” (Ward, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 215.)\n         As for the prosecutor’s statement that he “would submit to you that what\n[Mr. Williams] told you . . . is absolutely true,” the prosecutor preceded that statement\nwith a description of his testimony and with the proviso that “[y]ou’ll have to make that\njudgment.” Considered in context, this was not improper vouching. (See Ward, supra,\n\n                                             152\n\f36 Cal.4th at p. 216 [there was no improper vouching where the prosecutor, referring to a\nwitness’s testimony, said “ ‘The only thing I have ever told him is to tell the truth,\nnothing but the truth, and that’s what he did for you’ ”; the prosecutor “was no more than\nexpressing his view of and reasonable inferences from the totality of the evidence”]; see\nalso United States v. Necoechea (9th Cir. 1993) 986 F.2d 1273, 1279 [prosecutor stated,\n“ ‘I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that she’s not lying. I submit to you that she’s\ntelling the truth’ ”; the court concluded that “[t]hese ‘I submit’ statements do not\nconstitute vouching,” and “do not imply that the government is assuring [the witness’s]\nveracity”].)\n       There was no misconduct here.\n               vi. The claim of Griffin error\n       In Griffin v. California (1965) 380 U.S. 609, 615 (Griffin), the high court held that\nthe Fifth Amendment forbids comment by the prosecution on the accused’s silence.\n“Under the rule in Griffin, error is committed whenever the prosecutor or the court\ncomments, either directly or indirectly, upon defendant’s failure to testify in his defense.\nIt is well established, however, that the rule prohibiting comment on defendant’s silence\ndoes not extend to comments on the state of the evidence, or on the failure of the defense\nto introduce material evidence or to call logical witnesses.” (People v. Medina (1995)\n11 Cal.4th 694, 755; People v. Lewis (2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 670 [“The prosecutor is\npermitted, however, to comment on the state of the evidence, ‘including the failure of the\ndefense to introduce material evidence or to call witnesses.’ ”].) As People v. Murtishaw\n(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 757, tells us, applying the Griffin principle, “federal courts have\n‘held that for the government to say, in summation to the jury, that certain evidence was\n“uncontradicted,” when contradiction would have required the defendant to take the\nstand, drew attention to his failure to do so, and hence was unconstitutional.’\n[Citations.]” And “California decisions reach the same result.” (Ibid.)\n       Defendant challenges, as Griffin error, the following comments in the prosecutor’s\nargument. After pointing out that defendant “was positively identified by two\nindependent witnesses three days before the murders doing surveillance right at the\n\n                                             153\n\fperfect spot for ingress and egress in and out of Bradbury,” the prosecutor said: “I expect\nthat [defense counsel]’s going to stand up here and say, wait a minute, you can’t believe\nthe Stevenses identification. [Defendant] was never out there. He was never at that\nscene. [¶] Well, where is his alibi?” (At this point, defense counsel objected, the trial\ncourt overruled the objection, defense counsel cited Griffin error, and the trial court said\nthat would be discussed later.) The prosecutor continued: “If someone -- let’s see it’s ten\nminutes -- that’s seven minutes until 11:00 on December 18th, 2006. If someone said,\nhey, Mr. Jackson, you committed a crime on that day; or you were at such and such spot\non that day. I would call every single person in this courtroom and subpoena them to\ncourt to say, no, at six minutes until 11:00 on December 18, 2006, he was standing on a\nswatch of carpet eight feet in front of me.”\n       The prosecutor then described the subpoena power, and said: “The defense could\nhave called any witness they wanted to to provide an alibi for [defendant]. One of the\nmost important days of his life was March 16th, 1988. He found out that Mickey\nThompson and Trudy Thompson had been killed. If you believe the defense, he found\nout for the first time. [¶] Of course the evidence suggests that he found out that his plan\nhad worked. But even assuming that the defense is right and he didn’t know anything,\nthen why didn’t they call an employee; a business partner; somebody to say, hey, that\nweek before the murders [defendant] was with me. [¶] But you heard nothing from that.\nWhy? Because [defendant] was in front of the Stevens’ house three days before the\nmurders.”\n       After the argument, defense counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that the\nprosecutor’s comment was misconduct, as it was “commenting on the defendant’s refusal\nto testify by implication,” and “[i]f [defendant] were to present an alibi, that would\nrequire him to testify.” The court denied the request, saying, “this is a murky area,” but\n“I don’t view the statement commenting on the failure to call logical witnesses to testify\nas to [defendant’s] whereabouts on the day . . . of the Stevenses’ observation” as Griffin\nerror. “[A] lot of cases . . . indicate that that is a fine line. I don’t think the People have\ncrossed that line.”\n\n                                               154\n\f          We agree with the trial court. People v. Bradford (1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229\n(Bradford) is instructive. In that case, the court observed that a prosecutor “may commit\nGriffin error if he or she argues to the jury that certain testimony or evidence is\nuncontradicted, if such contradiction or denial could be provided only by the defendant,\nwho therefore would be required to take the witness stand.” (Id. at p. 1339.) In\nBradford, “there were brief comments by the prosecution during closing argument noting\nthe absence of evidence contradicting what was produced by the prosecution on several\npoints, and the failure of the defense to introduce material evidence or any alibi\nwitnesses. These comments, however, cannot fairly be interpreted as referring to\ndefendant’s failure to testify. Neither the general comment directed to the lack of defense\nevidence or testimony, nor the more particularized comments regarding . . . the absence\nof alibi for a particular time period, would have required defendant to take the stand.”\n(Ibid.)\n          People v. Vargas (1973) 9 Cal.3d 470 (Vargas) also demonstrates the point.\nThere, the court found Griffin error in the prosecutor’s statement that “ ‘there is no denial\nat all that they were there [robbing Mr. Olness]’ ” (Vargas, at p. 476), and explained:\n“[T]he word ‘denial’ connotes a personal response by the accused himself. Any witness\ncould ‘explain’ the facts, but only defendant himself could ‘deny’ his presence at the\ncrime scene. Accordingly, the jury could have interpreted the prosecutor’s remarks as\ncommenting upon defendant’s failure to take the stand and deny his guilt.” (Ibid.) On\nthe other hand, the court observed, in dicta, that another statement by the prosecutor was\nnot Griffin error. “[D]uring the prosecutor’s closing argument, the prosecutor agreed that\ndefendants did not have to take the stand, but he inquired, ‘Why didn’t they have some\nwitnesses to say where they were on the 29th, on the evening of the 29th. They had to be\nsomewhere . . . .’ ” (Vargas, at p. 474.) As to this statement, the court said, “under the\nrule in [People v. Bethea (1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 930, 936], the prosecutor’s initial\ncomments . . . regarding the lack of alibi witnesses was not Griffin error.” (Id. at p. 476,\nfn. 5.)\n\n\n\n                                             155\n\f       This case is no different from Bradford or Vargas. The prosecutor’s comment,\n“Well, where is his alibi?” may not be plucked from its context and then construed as\nreferring to defendant’s failure to testify. As in Bradford, the prosecutor clearly referred\nto the absence of any alibi witnesses, not to the defendant’s failure himself to testify that\nhe was elsewhere. And as in Bradford, none of the prosecutor’s “comments regarding\n. . . the absence of alibi for a particular time period, would have required defendant to\ntake the stand.” (Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1339.)\n       Defendant insists the prosecutor’s argument was “an attempt to shift the burden of\nproof to [defendant]” by inviting the jury to look to defendant for an explanation of\nwhere he was at the time. This claim has no merit. As Bradford tells us, “[a] distinction\nclearly exists between the permissible comment that a defendant has not produced any\nevidence, and on the other hand an improper statement that a defendant has a duty or\nburden to produce evidence, or a duty or burden to prove his or her innocence.”\n(Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1340.) There was no Griffin error.\n16. The Claim of Outrageous Government Misconduct\n       Defendant’s final contention, like his first, is a claim of outrageous governmental\nmisconduct. This time, the claim is not based on the prosecutor’s conduct relating to\nattorney-client privileged documents. Instead, defendant asserts, among other things, that\nthe prosecutor “relied heavily upon false evidence created by [Los Angeles Sheriff’s\nDepartment]’s investigators in order to arrest and convict [defendant].”\n       The “false evidence” consists of defendant’s contention that Detective Lillienfeld\nrepeatedly lied in sworn statements: in affidavits supporting the Orange County search\nand arrest warrants and the live lineup; in the grand jury proceedings; and at the Orange\nCounty preliminary hearing. The alleged lie was “that [defendant] owned a gun that was\nconsistent with the weapons used in the Thompson murders.” According to defendant,\nthis “false evidence” was used to arrest and charge defendant in Orange County, “setting\nin motion the juggernaut that resulted in [defendant’s] conviction.” In other words, but\nfor Detective Lillienfeld’s “perjury,” the prosecutors would have been unable to obtain\n\n\n\n                                             156\n\fsearch or arrest warrants (and, if the jury had been informed of these “falsehoods,”\ndefendant would have obtained a different result at trial).\n       We reject defendant’s claim of misconduct, both because it was forfeited and\nbecause it has no merit. We turn first to the facts of record relating to the claim of “false\nevidence” used to arrest and charge defendant.\n       a. The “false evidence” claim\n       Defendant repeatedly accuses Detective Lillienfeld of “perjury,” “lies,”\n“manufactur[ing] evidence,” and the like, based principally on the detective’s search\nwarrant affidavit of December 7, 2001, and other sworn testimony before the Orange\nCounty grand jury and at the April 2002 Orange County preliminary hearing, to the effect\nthat a .9-millimeter Smith & Wesson firearm owned by defendant could have been the\nmurder weapon.49 These statements were, according to Detective Lillienfeld, mistaken,\nand, according to defendant, lies. The facts as revealed at trial were these.\n       In the December 2001 affidavit, Detective Lillienfeld averred that Dwight Van\nHorn, firearms examiner at the sheriff’s crime lab, told him that the weapons used in the\nThompson murders had “rifling characteristics of six right lands and grooves,” and that\nthe possible manufacturers included Smith & Wesson, “with three character model\nnumbers.” Federal firearm sales records indicated defendant had purchased a Smith &\nWesson, model 469, in 1984, and the detective’s affidavit stated that “[t]his pistol falls\nwithin the rifling characteristics of the murder weapon, according to Deputy Dwight Van\nHorn . . . .” Similarly, the detective testified to the grand jury that defendant’s firearm\ncould have been a murder weapon. These statements were, as the detective later testified\nin the trial court, incorrect.\n\n\n\n49      We have denied defendant’s request for judicial notice of the Orange County\npreliminary hearing transcript and Detective Lillienfeld’s grand jury testimony. (See\nfn. 7, ante.) We refer to those documents only in the context of statements by counsel in\nthe trial court record and Detective Lillienfeld’s own references, during his trial\ntestimony, to his testimony in Orange County.\n\n\n                                             157\n\f       At the trial, defendant called Detective Lillienfeld as a defense witness, and sought\nto impeach him with previous false statements. This was based on Dwight Van Horn’s\nballistics memorandum, prepared shortly after the murders. The memorandum indicated\nthat certain guns (which included defendant’s) were specifically not included in the\nuniverse of possible guns that could have been used as the murder weapon, while\nDetective Lillienfeld testified in Orange County (and averred in his affidavit) to the\n“exact opposite.” The prosecutor objected, contending Detective Lillienfeld made a\nmistake and misinterpreted Mr. Van Horn’s ballistics report.\n       Defense counsel contended (and continues to do so on appeal) the claim of\nmistake was “incredible” and that, “[b]ased largely on this falsehood, [defendant] was\narrested for the Thompson murders . . . .” (No evidence is cited to support the claim that\ndefendant’s arrest was “[b]ased largely” on the detective’s statements about the gun; the\nsearch warrant affidavit extends to some 54 pages.)\n       The trial court held an Evidence Code section 402 hearing to determine whether\nthere was evidence indicating Detective Lillienfeld “committed a prior act involving\nmoral turpitude,” as such evidence would be relevant to challenge the detective’s\ncredibility. At the hearing, Detective Lillienfeld testified that in July 2001, the sheriff’s\ndepartment tested a Smith & Wesson three-digit model firearm, and the report showed\n“five lands and grooves with a right twist.” Mr. Van Horn did not tell him that the\nmurder weapon had six lands and grooves, and his impression from reading Mr. Van\nHorn’s memorandum was “that a Smith & Wesson .9 millimeter pistol with a three-\ncharacter model number was a potential murder weapon in this case.” Detective\nLillienfeld did not look into any database to determine whether a Smith & Wesson three-\ndigit model number produced five or six lands and grooves.\n       The subject line of Mr. Van Horn’s memorandum was: “.9 Millimeter Pistols to\nbe Eliminated as Suspect Guns.” The list included Smith & Wesson three-digit model\nnumbers, and it also included Glocks, as well as weapons that could have been eliminated\n“just by virtue of sight, for instance, machine-type guns, machine-gun type Uzis, and\nMack Tens.” (A postscript to the memorandum indicated that “maybe we can eliminate\n\n                                             158\n\fthese [Uzis, Mack Tens, etc.] with a photo line-up.”) Detective Lillienfeld was asked if\nhe was aware that “bullets fired from a Glock look completely distinguishable from other\nfirearms,” and responded, “No.” Detective Lillienfeld interpreted the subject line of the\nmemorandum “to mean that the below list of guns should be brought to me I can – ‘me,’\nmeaning Dwight Van Horn, the ballistics expert. I can conduct ballistics exam on them\nand eliminate them as being potentially the murder weapon.” Detective Lillienfeld\nagreed that “it sound[ed] like Mr. Van Horn was saying we can eliminate these guns [the\nUzis, etc.] based on a photo line-up; we can eliminate these guns [the Smith & Wessons,\netc.] based on ballistics,” and that was how he was testifying when he said that “it\nappeared that these guns were in the possible universe of guns that needed to be\neliminated as suspect weapons.”\n        Detective Lillienfeld also testified that, when he spoke to Mr. Van Horn, “I asked\nhim specifically about that memo you’re holding and asked him if those were all possible\nguns. And the response I got was, yes, those are all possible guns that were used in this\ncrime.” Detective Lillienfeld said that no one advised him, before his testimony to the\nOrange County grand jury, “that the murder weapon was not a five land and groove.”\nFurther, he was not aware that the July 2001 test of a Smith & Wesson three-digit model\n“would apply to all three-digit Smith & Wesson models.”\n        Detective Lillienfeld admitted testifying to the grand jury that the three-digit\nmodel Smith & Wesson registered to defendant could have been a murder weapon; that\nhe put that information in subsequent affidavits; and that it was incorrect. He did not\nattempt to verify the information with Mr. Van Horn before testifying, and he did not\nattempt to check databases containing information on the general rifling characteristics of\nthe guns. Detective Lillienfeld became aware of his mistake “I believe some time in\n2001,” when defendant’s appellate attorney identified the error “through a series of\nlitigation in court . . . .”\n        Detective Lillienfeld also testified that the July 2001 test was on a weapon\nregistered to defendant. The detective testified at the Orange County preliminary hearing\nin 2002, and he knew before he testified “that the one – at least the one gun that [he] took\n\n                                             159\n\ffrom [defendant] that was a three-digit model Smith & Wesson was not the murder\nweapon.” He did not so state in his testimony at the Orange County preliminary hearing,\nbut he was not asked that specific question. His understanding was that other three-digit\nmodels (other than the one tested) “could be in the universe of possible suspect guns.”\n       After Detective Lillienfeld’s testimony, defense counsel argued that the jury\nshould decide “whether or not that was a lie or just negligence.” The court ruled\notherwise, observing that “I read [Mr. Van Horn’s memorandum] the same way that the\ndetective did,” and “I would interpret that the same way.” The court said, “I don’t have\nthe experience the detective does, but I certainly can read English,” and concluded, “just\nso it’s clear, I mean there is really nothing in the record to indicate that this witness\ncommitted an act of moral turpitude which would bear on his credibility based on what I\nheard.”\n       b. Other claims\n       In addition to the claim of perjury related to defendant’s firearm, defendant recites,\nat length, other grievances about the investigation.\n       Defendant asserts Detective Lillienfeld and the prosecutors used Gail Moreau-\nHunter’s “demonstrably false” statement that defendant confessed to her in order to\nprosecute defendant. He makes unsupported claims that Detective Lillienfeld “falsely\ntestified” at the Orange County preliminary hearing “that Gail Moreau-Hunter had not\nattempted suicide.”\n       Defendant asserts that Detective Griggs’s investigation was “derailed” by Collene\nCampbell’s interference. (Ms. Campbell complained about Detective Griggs, and\ndefendant’s recitation is based on a memorandum Detective Griggs wrote about the\ninvestigation and Ms. Campbell’s activities in connection with it. None of the facts\ndefendant recites suggests the investigation was “derailed” by Ms. Campbell’s activities.)\n       Defendant asserts that Detective Lillienfeld “permitted Campbell to direct his\ninvestigation.” (Nothing is cited that supports this claim.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              160\n\f       He asserts without record authority that the Los Angeles District Attorney\n“attempted to inhibit all information that did not support the theory [defendant] was\nresponsible for the Thompson murders.”\n       He asserts that Detective Lillienfeld “usurped power” by presenting his case to the\nOrange County District Attorney after the Los Angeles District Attorney rejected it in\n1998, and his actions were “ratified by the OCDA and later by the LADA,” all of which\n“shock[s] the conscience and constitute[s] outrageous government misconduct.”\n       c. Forfeiture of the claim of outrageous government misconduct\n       Defendant forfeited his claim of investigatory misconduct by failing to make it\nbefore the trial court.\n       Defendant concedes the “lack of objection,” but says it would have been futile to\nmake an objection to Detective Lillienfeld’s pretrial misconduct, because (1) the trial\ncourt denied his other motions to dismiss for misconduct (see pt. 1, ante), and (2) after\nthe Evidence Code section 402 hearing just described, the trial court refused to permit\ndefense counsel to impeach Detective Lillienfeld with his “false testimony.” We do not\nagree the claim would have been futile.\n       Defendant’s other motions were based on the seizure, retention and review of\nattorney-client privileged documents, not on the investigatory misconduct defendant now\nasserts. Moreover, defendant now makes claims of improper interference with the\ninvestigation, usurpation of power, and the like, in addition to the claims of “perjury” and\n“manufactured evidence.” There is no excuse for the failure to make these claims to the\ntrial court, which repeatedly showed its willingness to entertain defense objections and\nmotions on all manner of claims.\n       The cases defendant cites to support his claim of futility show that futility is an\nappropriate basis for a failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct in extreme cases,\nwhere the misconduct is pervasive and the trial court does not act. (See, e.g., Dykes,\nsupra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 775 [rejecting futility argument; unlike the case in Hill, supra,\n17 Cal.4th 800, “the present case did not involve counsel experiencing—as did counsel in\nHill—a ‘constant barrage’ of misstatements, demeaning sarcasm, and falsehoods, or\n\n                                             161\n\fongoing hostility on the part of the trial court, to appropriate, well-founded objections”].)\nThis is obviously not such a case.\n       Further, the claims defendant makes are precisely the sort of claims that require\nfact finding and credibility determinations by the trial court. All the evidence defendant\nasserts in support of his claims was available at the time of trial. In short, defendant does\nnot present a compelling case for excusing the forfeiture of his claims of investigatory\nmisconduct.\n       d. The merits\n       Defendant has forfeited his claim of outrageous government misconduct, but in\nany event it has no merit. We briefly address each of defendant’s assertions (except for\nthose already described, in subpart b., ante, as having no support in the record).\n       First, there is the claim of “perjury” in connection with defendant’s firearm. As\ndescribed above, the trial court heard Detective Lillienfeld’s testimony on those points,\nand found “nothing in the record to indicate that this witness committed an act of moral\nturpitude which would bear on his credibility . . . .” We are bound by that determination.\n(See Ochoa, supra, 6 Cal.4th at p. 1206 [“we must . . . not substitute our evaluation of a\nwitness’s credibility for that of the fact finder”].) As our recitation above shows,\nsubstantial evidence supported the trial court’s credibility determination.\n       Defendant insists it is “inherently improbable” that Detective Lillienfeld did not\nrealize defendant’s weapon could not have been the murder weapon, citing People v.\nHeadlee (1941) 18 Cal.2d 266, 267 (appellate court may set aside a conviction where\n“the evidence relied upon by the prosecution is so improbable as to be incredible”). But\n“[t]o be improbable on its face the evidence must assert that something has occurred that\nit does not seem possible could have occurred under the circumstances disclosed.” (Ibid.;\nsee People v. Mayberry (1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 150 [“To warrant the rejection of the\nstatements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court, there must exist\neither a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without\nresorting to inferences or deductions.”].) This is not such a case.\n\n\n\n                                             162\n\f       Next, defendant contends Detective Lillienfeld and the prosecutors used\n“demonstrably false” statements from Gail Moreau-Hunter (that defendant confessed to\nher), in order to prosecute defendant. (Ms. Hunter testified at the preliminary hearing –\nbut not at trial – to the effect that defendant told her he hired two black teenagers to carry\nout the murders.) Defendant’s idea of “demonstrably false” is not ours. Defendant relies\non medical records not in evidence for the proposition that Ms. Moreau-Hunter was\n“delusional” and therefore her preliminary hearing testimony was “inherently improbable\nand demonstrably false.” We will not make the leap from allegations (without\nevidentiary support) of severe mental illness to conclusions that testimony is\n“demonstrably false.” Nor will we assume that the prosecutors knew Ms. Moreau-\nHunter’s statements were false when she testified at the preliminary hearing, as the record\nis devoid of any such evidence. And, of course, defendant could not have been\nprejudiced by the use of Ms. Moreau-Hunter’s testimony at the preliminary hearing, as\ndefendant was convicted at trial without it.\n       Next, defendant makes a convoluted argument that Detective Lillienfeld “usurped\npower,” “engaged in forum-shopping,” and acted as “a rogue officer proceeding under\nthe political influence of a private citizen, Campbell” when he “expand[ed] his\ninvestigation into Orange County” and presented his case to the Orange County District\nAttorney after the Los Angeles District Attorney rejected it in 1998. This claim suffers\nfrom the same flaws as defendant’s other claims of misconduct.\n       First, defendant cites no evidence whatever for the assertion that Detective\nLillienfeld acted at the behest of Collene Campbell. Second, defendant cites Penal Code\nsection 830.1, and other authorities that likewise have no pertinence, to support his claim\nthat the detective “lacked authority to expand his investigation into Orange County.”\nSection 830.1 provides just the opposite: it states, among other things, that a deputy\nsheriff is a peace officer and his authority extends “to any place in the state” as to any\npublic offense committed “within the political subdivision that employs the peace\nofficer . . . .” (Pen. Code, § 830.1, subd. (a)(1).) Third, defendant cites no authority on\n“forum-shopping” by a peace officer, and his recitation of the law on venue is simply\n\n                                               163\n\finapt; the venue issue was resolved long ago in defendant’s favor. (Indeed, the Court of\nAppeal in that case mentioned defendant’s earlier claims of conflict of interest in the\nOrange County district attorney’s personal relationship with Mickey Thompson’s sister,\nCollene Campbell, noting that it had allowed defendant “to pursue his assertion below\nthat Orange County lacked any disinterested purpose in prosecution.” (Goodwin v.\nSuperior Court, supra, G031285, pp. 2-3.))\n       In short, defendant has made no showing that Detective Lillienfeld’s conduct\nconsisted of anything other than disinterested activity aimed at bringing the person\nresponsible for the Thompson murders to account. The same is true of defendant’s claim\nthat prosecutors in both counties “ced[ed] essential prosecution functions to Campbell,\nand prosecut[ed] [defendant] based on Campbell’s political power, influence and\nconnections rather than untainted facts obtained in an unbiased manner.” This is nothing\nbut hyperbole, without support in any evidence.\n       Finally, we note again that “a showing of prejudice to defendant’s right to a fair\ntrial [is] required” to sustain a due process claim of outrageous government conduct, and\n“the absence of such a showing preclude[s] dismissal as a sanction for prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 861.) None of defendant’s allegations\nsupports the notion that he received anything other than a fair trial.\n17. Cumulative Error\n       Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the various errors he asserts requires\nreversal. Because we have found no error that, either alone or in conjunction with others,\nprejudiced defendant, we necessarily conclude there was no cumulative error.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                 GRIMES, J.\n       We concur:\n\n\n              BIGELOW, P.

More than\n13 years later, defendant Michael Frank Goodwin was arrested in Orange County for the\nmurders. After the Orange County prosecution was dismissed for improper venue,\ndefendant was prosecuted in Los Angeles County, and in January 2007, a jury convicted\nhim of the first degree murder of both victims, and found true special allegations of\nmultiple murders and that the murders were committed by means of lying in wait.\n       The prosecution adduced evidence of bitter lawsuits between defendant and\nMr. Thompson over business matters in the three years preceding the murders, lawsuits\nthat ended badly for defendant. Many witnesses testified to defendant’s expressed hatred\nof Mr. Thompson and defendant’s numerous threats, repeated to many witnesses over a\nlengthy period of time, that he intended to kill Mr. Thompson and hurt his family. There\nwas eyewitness testimony placing defendant, with binoculars, in a car (with another\nunidentified man) parked in the Thompson neighborhood a few days before the murders.\nAnd there was evidence defendant and his wife liquidated assets and left the country on a\nnewly purchased yacht five months after the murders.\n       The defense case challenged the eyewitness identification of the man in the parked\ncar and tried to prove the murders were the result of a robbery gone wrong rather than a\ncontract “hit,” and that investigators made numerous errors and improperly focused their\nefforts on defendant rather than undertaking an unbiased search for the truth.\n       Defendant challenges his convictions on many grounds. He contends the case\nshould have been dismissed, or the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office should have\nbeen recused, or the two prosecutors should have been removed, because of the seizure,\nretention and review of attorney-client privileged documents.\n       He contends the evidence was insufficient for conviction, claiming the eyewitness\nidentification of defendant as the man in the parked car was not credible evidence of a\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fconnection between defendant and the killers or of any agreement to murder the\nThompsons.\n       He contends the long delay in prosecuting him was unjustified and prejudicial,\nviolating his state and federal constitutional rights to due process of law.\n       He asserts a possible Pitchess1 violation.\n       He asserts error in the admission of expert testimony on financial transactions that\noccurred after Mickey Thompson won a large judgment against defendant.\n       He asserts the trial court improperly admitted evidence that Mr. Thompson\nexpressed fear of defendant, evidence of defendant’s bad character, and evidence of\nMr. Thompson’s good character.\n       He contends the trial court erred in excluding evidence, including evidence of\npotential third party culpability; evidence that Mickey Thompson had purchased a large\nquantity of gold just before the murders; and evidence that another individual had failed\nthree polygraph examinations but nevertheless investigators failed to pursue him as a\nsuspect.\n       He asserts error in giving a conspiracy instruction; error in instructing the jury it\ncould consider a witness’s level of certainty when evaluating eyewitness identification;\nand error in instructing the jury it could consider defendant’s departure from the country\non a yacht five months after the murders as evidence of flight and consciousness of guilt.\n       He asserts multiple forms of prosecutorial misconduct.\n       He contends dismissal is required because of outrageous government conduct\n“from the beginning of the investigation to verdict,” claiming among other things that\nMickey Thompson’s sister, Collene Campbell, improperly influenced the investigation\nthrough her personal connections with the Orange County District Attorney.\n       And he asserts reversal is required based on the cumulative effect of multiple\nerrors in the case.\n\n\n\n1      Pitchess v.

Background\n      Mickey Thompson was a well-known race car driver who set a land speed record\nin his youth. By the 1980’s, Mr. Thompson was running a successful sports promotion\ncompany that sponsored indoor stadium races, principally with off-road, four-wheeled\nvehicles. Defendant ran a similar business, Stadium Motor Sports Corporation,\npromoting stadium motorcycle racing. In 1984, the two men entered into a business\nventure together to promote stadium motor sports events. The deal involved a stock\ntransfer agreement with the parties combining their businesses and sharing profits and\nlosses, 70 percent to defendant and 30 percent to Mr. Thompson.\n      Within months, the business relationship deteriorated. Defendant refused to\nadvance monies for an event according to the 70/30 formula, and then claimed\nMr. Thompson had defaulted, entitling him (defendant) to take over Mr. Thompson’s\ncompany.2 Mr. Thompson sued defendant and his company in October 1984. In\nFebruary 1986, the trial court entered judgment for Mr. Thompson totaling over $790,000\nin damages, prejudgment interest and attorney fees.\n      In the years after the litigation began, Mr. Thompson continued to successfully\npromote motor sports events in various arenas, while defendant’s business suffered.\nDefendant had originated the idea of staging motorcycle events at the stadium in\nAnaheim, and had done so successfully for years. But after 1987, Gregory Smith, the\n\n2       Charles Stewart Linkletter, who worked for defendant in 1984 while the business\nventure with Mr. Thompson was being negotiated, overheard a conversation between\ndefendant and another executive of defendant’s company while driving them to\ndefendant’s Laguna office. Mr. Linkletter described the conversation as a 45-minute\ndiatribe by defendant to the effect that “he was going to screw Mickey out of his\nbusiness” and “rip him off.” Then defendant told Mr. Linkletter, “Stew, if you ever say a\nword about this conversation to anybody, I will fucking kill you.” A few days or weeks\nlater, Mr. Linkletter drove from Laguna to the Thompson residence to get\nMr. Thompson’s signature on a contract.\n\n                                            4\n\fAnaheim Stadium executive director, stopped doing business with defendant and hired\nMr. Thompson and another company to produce all of Anaheim’s motor sports events,\nincluding the event defendant previously produced. (One of several reasons for the\nchange was that defendant’s company was in bankruptcy.) Defendant was very upset\nwhen he received the news that his proposal for those events had been rejected in favor of\nMr. Thompson. Anaheim Stadium executives announced the change at a press\nconference in August 1987, and the events held in January 1988 were very successful.\n       Defendant had held an exclusive contract for motor sports events at the Rose Bowl\nin 1985 and 1986, but the Pasadena City Council selected Mr. Thompson’s company to\nhold an event in May 1987, which also made defendant very angry. Mr. Thompson was\nalso selected to run an event in the summer of 1988, but the murders prevented that.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson’s vigorous attempts to collect on his judgment against\ndefendant were largely unsuccessful. Mr. Thompson’s lawyers prevented defendant from\nusing private sureties to satisfy the appellate bond requirement, but were not able to find\nany assets, which appeared to have been transferred. In September 1986, defendant\nchanged the name of his company and filed for bankruptcy protection. In November\n1986, defendant filed for personal bankruptcy.\n       Mr. Thompson’s lawyer, Philip Bartinetti, described the litigation as one of “the\nmost vigorously contested I’ve ever been involved in.” Another of Mr. Thompson’s\nlawyers, who was responsible for attempting to collect the judgment, described the\nlitigation as “absolutely beyond a doubt the most bitter and contentiously fought lawsuit\nI’ve ever been involved in.”\n       The judgment for Mr. Thompson was affirmed on appeal and the Supreme Court\ndenied review on January 29, 1988, a few months before the murders. In another lawsuit\ndefendant filed in Orange County against Mr. Thompson and his company, the court\nordered summary judgment in favor Mr. Thompson on March 2, 1988, about two weeks\nbefore the murders.\n       After the bankruptcy filings in September and November 1986, Mr. Thompson\nhad wanted to settle the matter, and there were extensive settlement negotiations.\n\n                                             5\n\fApparent deals were reached a dozen times, but then defendant “would change something\nat the last minute and it would fall apart.” Mr. Thompson’s lawyer concluded defendant\nwas not negotiating in good faith.\n       After the bankruptcy filing of defendant’s company, now named Entertainment\nSpecialties, Inc. (ESI), the bankruptcy examiner recommended appointment of a trustee\nfor ESI. Jeffrey Coyne was appointed trustee in late June 1987. He discovered “there\nwas no operating company to run,” as “the operating part of the company had been sold\nby E.S.I.” to a company named Supercross, Inc. (SXI), a company owned and operated\nby defendant’s wife and a man named Charles Clayton. When he examined the books\nand the transfer to SXI, Mr. Coyne found “lots of gaping holes” and determined that\nmuch of what he saw in ESI and the transfer to SXI “was all done for the purpose of\nmoving the business without paying the creditors,” the most vocal and the most interested\nof whom was Mr. Thompson. Mr. Coyne discovered that SXI was in default on\npayments to ESI for assets transferred to SXI, and believed the activity of defendant, his\nwife, ESI and SXI to be fraud affecting Mr. Thompson’s rights as a creditor, as ESI’s\nprimary assets had been shifted away.\n       Mr. Coyne took steps to recover the assets, and SXI eventually paid $385,000 of\nthe outstanding $500,000 owed. Mr. Coyne pursued recovery of the remaining amount\nand refused to acquiesce in defendant’s efforts to have various bankruptcy estate assets\npaid to his wife and parents. At a meeting a few weeks before the murders, defendant,\ntrembling and in a “black rage,” approached within inches of Mr. Coyne’s face and said,\n“You better lighten up or things will get bad,” and “If you fuck up my life, I’ll fuck up\nyours.” Describing his experience with the ESI bankruptcy, Mr. Coyne said it was “the\nhighest level I had ever seen of acrimony, anger, intensity, resentment and rage.”\n2. Defendant’s Threats Against Mr. Thompson\n       We summarize now the evidence of the multiple occasions on which defendant\nexpressed his hatred of Mr. Thompson and his intent to kill him during the years\npreceding the murders.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       a. William and Nina Wilson\n       In January or February 1988, William and Nina Wilson hosted dinner at their\nhome for defendant and his wife. (Mr. Wilson was general manager of Jack Murphy\nStadium in San Diego, and had also managed the Rose Bowl; he had worked with both\nMr. Thompson and defendant on various motor sports promotions.) When Mr. Wilson\nasked defendant how he was doing, defendant replied, “Terrible.” Defendant was angry\nand said: “Fucking Thompson is killing me. He’s taking everything I’ve got. He’s\ndestroying me. I’m going to take him out.” When Mr. Wilson responded, “Nobody wins\nthat one. Mickey’s dead and you’re in prison,” defendant replied, “Oh, no,” and “I’m too\nsmart for that. They’ll never catch me.” Nina Wilson heard the conversation and\ncorroborated her husband’s account, saying that defendant said, “I just hate him,” and\nrepeated, “I’m going to take him out.” Both the Wilsons believed defendant was serious.\nMr. Wilson was “very upset” and Ms. Wilson was “shock[ed].” When he saw how\nshocked the Wilsons were, defendant said, “Well, you know I’m just kidding. I could\nnever do anything like that.”\n       b. Gregory Smith\n       Mr. Smith, the Anaheim Stadium executive, was subpoenaed to testify at a\nbankruptcy court hearing in 1987. This was at a time when decisions were being made or\nhad recently been made about the award of the Anaheim motorcycle event to\nMr. Thompson. Mr. Smith was sitting at the back of the courtroom before the hearing\nwhen defendant sat down behind him and said, “You don’t know what you’re doing to\nme. You’ll be sorry for this. I’ll be back.” Mr. Smith considered defendant’s statement\nthreatening. He had had several conversations with defendant before, and in every one,\ndefendant was “unhappy” and “mad that we would consider not having him come back\nand put on the supercross event.” Defendant was “confrontational and very, very upset,”\nbut the courtroom conversation “was the first where I considered it threatening when I\nwas being told that I would regret this decision.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       c. Scott Hernandez\n       Scott Hernandez worked for defendant’s company from the spring of 1985 to late\n1987, when defendant closed the office. The office walls were thin, and the offices of\ndefendant and Mr. Hernandez shared a wall, so Mr. Hernandez could overhear\ndiscussions in defendant’s adjoining office. In late 1987, Mickey Thompson’s name\ncame up frequently and was a source of tension in the office. “When Mickey Thompson\nwas brought up by [defendant], it was usually in a rageful manner. Not geared towards\nthe office personnel, but him expressing his anger and frustration . . . .”\n       On one occasion, Mr. Hernandez heard defendant on the telephone with his\nattorneys in the Thompson case, and then heard a ruckus that “sounded like books flying,\nhitting the wall, and [defendant] going into a rage.” Mr. Hernandez heard defendant say,\n“I’ll kill that mother fucker. I’ll kill that mother fucker.” Mr. Hernandez described\ndefendant’s voice level as “in anger, just livid anger.” (In 2002, Mr. Hernandez told a\ndetective that this incident occurred in February or March 1987, rather than late 1987.)\n       d. Cheryl Sarantis\n       Cheryl Sarantis was an employee of defendant’s company in 1986 and 1987, until\nthe office closed, working on advertising and marketing. She heard defendant “ranting\nand raving” about Mr. Thompson on a regular basis, every day that defendant was in the\noffice. On one occasion, she heard lamps crashing against the wall of the conference\nroom, followed by defendant’s ranting and raving about Mr. Thompson. She also\nrecalled defendant saying that he “was going to destroy Mickey Thompson.” (When\npolice interviewed Ms. Sarantis, she said the word “destroy” was her characterization of\nwhat defendant said, and not a direct quote from defendant.)\n       e. Kathy Weese\n       Kathy Weese, who was then known as Kathy Johnson, worked for defendant for\nsix to eight months as a secretary in 1986. She often answered the telephone when\nMickey Thompson called. Defendant and Mr. Thompson “were always talking about the\nmoney situation.” On one occasion, Mr. Thompson phoned defendant, and Ms. Weese\noverheard defendant say, twice, “I’m going to take you out.” The two continued to\n\n                                              8\n\fargue, and Ms. Weese heard defendant say, “It would cost me $500 and a motor vehicle\nto have you taken out and I will take you out.” (Ms. Weese did not tell police about that\nstatement when she was interviewed in 1997, but the detective who interviewed her heard\nMs. Weese testify to the same effect at a preliminary hearing in Orange County in\n2002.)3\n       f. Barron Wehinger\n       Barron Wehinger, 16 years old in the fall of 1984, lived with his stepfather, Tom\nVillelli, in Durango, Colorado. Defendant visited the Durango residence, and discussed\nwith Mr. Villelli his “court battle” with Mr. Thompson. Mr. Wehinger heard defendant\ntell his stepfather, “I’ll kill him.” According to Mr. Wehinger, defendant said he was\ngoing to kill Mr. Thompson “[i]f he [defendant] lost his power to run the superbowl of\nmotorcross, his million-dollar-a-year income.” Mr. Wehinger heard defendant say, “I can\nget it done for 50 grand.” Mr. Villelli replied, “I could get it done for 20 grand,” and\ndefendant said, “I don’t want to get you involved, Tom.” Mr. Wehinger explained all this\nwas vivid in his memory because, around the same time, defendant had visited and\noffered to help Mr. Wehinger and his brother with their motocross careers, and “[w]hen\nsomebody offers you a chance to ride superbowl of motorcross, you listen to every word\nthey say, and when I heard that, I’ll never forget it.”\n       Mr. Wehinger did not mention anything about the $50,000 when he testified at the\npreliminary hearing in this case, and he never mentioned anything about a hit man to the\npolice or to the prosecutor. In his previous testimony, Mr. Wehinger said that the only\nthing he heard defendant say was “he [(defendant)] would have him [(Mr. Thompson)]\n\n\n\n\n3      Ms. Weese had a criminal history. She used aliases and had several theft-related\nconvictions. She had walked away from a Colorado halfway house (because she was\nbeaten and her daughter was attacked) to come to Los Angeles. Defendant had\nMs. Weese arrested, claiming she embezzled money. She was acquitted of that charge,\nbut spent eight months in custody awaiting trial and later was sent back to Colorado to\ncomplete her sentence there. She told police, “If I can help you get this guy, I’ll do\nanything,” and referred to defendant as a “son of a bitch.”\n\n                                              9\n\ftaken care of if he lost.” In 2003, Mr. Wehinger told police he heard defendant talking in\nlate 1987, or perhaps 60 or 90 days before the murders, rather than in 1984.\n        g. Penn Weldon\n        In November or December 1987, Penn Weldon, a private investigator, met\ndefendant to discuss possible investigative work for defendant. Defendant was “very\nupset and angry” during the hour-long meeting, and said he had been “fucked royally” by\nMickey Thompson; that he was so angry he had recently thrown a chair through the\nwindow of his house; and “that Mickey had ruined his life and he wanted to get even with\nhim.” Defendant wanted Mr. Weldon to investigate Mr. Thompson’s attorney, Philip\nBartinetti, and place listening devices in Mr. Bartinetti’s home and cars. Mr. Weldon\nrefused to do that, but agreed to and did perform other investigative actions relating to\nMr. Bartinetti.\n        h. Karen Dragutin\n        In the months preceding the murders, Karen Dragutin was at a Laguna Beach\nrestaurant with a man who knew defendant very well, and they were joined by defendant\nand his wife. Defendant’s jovial attitude changed when the conversation turned to\nlawyers and lawsuits and Mickey Thompson. Defendant became angry, said he “was\ngetting screwed by the lawyers”; “[t]he only way to get out of the mess was to take care\nof Mickey Thompson”; and “the only way he was going to get out of it is if Mickey\nThompson died.” Ms. Dragutin also testified defendant “was talking about a boat and\ngoing to Bermuda. And it was still in the context of that conversation. So my conclusion\nwas he was going away.” Defendant’s statement about the boat and going to Bermuda\n“was in the same part of the conversation as the taking care of this mess and Mickey had\nto die . . . .”\n        i. Gregory Keay\n        Gregory Keay was defendant’s cousin. At a family gathering two or three months\nbefore the murders, defendant said that “Mickey was out to get all of his money and\nbefore that would happen, he would have him wasted.” (When police interviewed\nMr. Keay in 1997, Mr. Keay did not use the term “wasted”; he told the detective that\n\n                                             10\n\fdefendant said, “That partner of mine is rubbing me the wrong way, he won’t be rubbing\nme much longer.”)\n       j. Dale Newman\n       In the fall of 1987, Dale Newman and a friend flew to Mexico to go diving, and\nmet defendant, who sent a 60-foot boat to the beach to pick them up. That evening, they\nwere on the bridge deck with defendant and his wife. Mr. Newman overheard defendant\nand his wife commiserating over a legal matter. Mr. Newman did not recall his exact\nwords, but defendant told his wife, in a threatening tone, in effect “that nothing bad was\ngoing to happen because he was going to take care of the party involved.”\n       k. John Williams\n       John Williams was a deputy marshal in Orange County from 1986 through 1988.\nHe was assigned to levy on defendant’s Mercedes automobile in connection with\nlitigation involving Mickey Thompson. He went to defendant’s residence and, in the\ncourse of the removal of the Mercedes, defendant said, “Mickey Thompson is fucking\ndead. He doesn’t know who he’s fucking with.” Both defendant and his wife used an\nextraordinary amount of “vicious language” about Mr. Thompson, and both repeated that\nMr. Thompson “was going to have something happen to him.” Mr. Williams reported the\nincident to his supervisor, and telephoned Mr. Thompson’s attorney to report the\nsuccessful levy and the threatening comments.\n       Mr. Williams testified that the incident occurred about three months before the\nThompson murders, but documentation showed a writ to levy was issued on June 4,\n1986; a levy worksheet was dated June 11, 1986; and a receipt for the towing service\nused for the defendant’s car was dated August 14, 1986. Mr. Williams, when shown\nthese documents, continued to insist the incident did not occur in August 1986. (After\nthe bankruptcies were filed in September and November 1986, Mr. Thompson would\nhave been unable to levy on the Mercedes, and in January 1988, defendant surrendered\nhis Mercedes to a representative of the bankruptcy trustee without incident.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f       l. Nancy Lucia\n       Nancy Lucia (formerly Wilkinson) worked for the Thompsons on weekends for\nseveral years and was a personal friend of Trudy Thompson’s. Ms. Lucia came to the\nThompsons’ home in the fall of 1987 to show Trudy Thompson her wedding\nphotographs. While they were in an upstairs room looking at the photographs, Mickey\nThompson came upstairs, out of breath and frantic. He was “almost kind of yelling,\nsaying ‘[c]lose the window. Close the drapes. [Defendant] could have a sniper out there\nright now.” The drapes were open at the time.\n       m. Joel Weissler\n       Joel Weissler was the Thompsons’ nephew. He met defendant in 1984 or 1985, at\na race promoted by his uncle, where the Thompsons introduced defendant as their “new\npartner.” Mr. Weissler talked with defendant for about five minutes, and remained in his\ncompany for the four-hour racing event. Mr. Weissler also spoke briefly to defendant at\na later event.\n       In late 1987 or early 1988, Mr. Weissler overheard defendant on the telephone.\nMr. Weissler was talking on the telephone with Trudy Thompson, and could hear Mickey\nThompson in the background, speaking with defendant on another phone line.\nMr. Weissler heard defendant say, in a loud, threatening tone, “You will never see a cent\nof it. I’m going to hurt you and your family.” Mr. Thompson responded, “Leave my\nfamily out of it.”\n       About a month later, Mr. Weissler was visiting the Thompsons’ home. He saw\nMickey Thompson and heard defendant’s voice on the speakerphone, saying: “You and\nyour family won’t see a penny of this. I’ll get you. I’m going to hurt you,” and “I’m\ngoing to hurt your family.” Mr. Thompson was very agitated and repeatedly said, “You\nstay away from me. You stay away from my family.”\n       At the time of the Thompsons’ funeral, Mr. Weissler told a detective he had heard\ndefendant make threats, but he was not asked for any details about the threats. In August\n1991, he and an uncle went to a police station in Los Angeles and met with the police to\nfind out what was going on with the investigation, as they were “impatient for something\n\n                                           12\n\fto happen.” When Mr. Weissler was asked whether he mentioned the phone\nconversations he had heard to the police at the August 1991 meeting, he said he did not\nrecall and he thought what he had to say was very redundant.\n       n. Lance Johnson\n       Lance Johnson was a friend and neighbor of the Thompsons. Years after the\nmurders, he was at the Santa Ana federal courthouse with Mickey Thompson’s sister,\nCollene Campbell. Defendant walked by, and Mr. Johnson heard him whisper to\nMs. Campbell, “You’re going to get yours, bitch.”4\n3. The Setting for the Murders and Other Pre-murder Facts\n       The Thompsons lived on Woodlyn Lane in a hilly neighborhood in “horse\ncountry,” with an irregular network of streets and private lanes or roads where “people\nget lost all the time.” Several driveways led out of the Thompson property, one of them\nto Woodlyn Lane, which was electronically gated. There was a locked gate between\nWoodlyn Lane and Royal Oaks, and a bike path below Royal Oaks. The home was also\naccessible via Mt. Olive Drive.\n       Ronald and Tonyia Stevens lived on Mt. Olive Drive. Several days before the\nmurders, near midday, as Mr. Stevens drove past the horse corral next to his home, he\nnoticed a car parked on the wrong side of the street. The person in the driver’s seat was\nlooking through binoculars in the direction of the nearby grammar school. Mr. Stevens\npulled into his driveway at the far end of the corral. His wife and daughter were there,\nand they told him the people in the car had been there for five or ten minutes.\nMr. Stevens asked his wife to call the police and walked through the corral to investigate.\nHe approached from behind the car, a blue-green, rusted and dirty 1970’s Chevy station\nwagon with Arizona plates.\n\n\n\n4       At defendant’s trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. Johnson if he recalled telling the\npolice that the words he heard defendant say were, “I’m going to get you, too.”\nMr. Johnson said it was “a very threatening remark to Collene Campbell,” but he did not\nrecall stating those words to the police.\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       From a distance of eight feet, Mr. Stevens saw two men in the car. The one in the\ndriver’s seat, a large man with “light-ish reddish hair,” wearing a cap on the back portion\nof his head, was holding binoculars. Mr. Stevens looked at the driver’s face for about a\nminute, mostly from his left profile; he “wanted to see who it was,” because “the person\ndidn’t belong there looking towards the school.” As Mr. Stevens approached, the driver\nturned around and looked directly at him, and then drove away. Mr. Stevens made a\nmental note of the driver’s face and tried to remember it. He also wrote down the license\nplate of the car on a business card. (Mr. Stevens told police that he was only able to view\nthe driver from the side; at trial he was asked if he remembered telling the detective that\nhe had only gotten within 15 or 20 feet of the driver, but he did not recall saying that. He\nalso did not remember telling the detective he was not sure which man had the\nbinoculars.)\n       Tonyia Stevens also saw the men in the car, “an old clunker station wagon with\nArizona plates,” two or three days before the murder, between noon and 3:00 p.m. She\nwas driving her daughter home from school, and turned left into her driveway. As she\npassed the car, she looked directly at the men and got a face-on view of the driver, who\nwas just putting down binoculars. She and her daughter went into the house and talked\nabout whether to call the police, because that type of car was out of place in the area, and\nshe was concerned about child abduction. Then her husband arrived, told Ms. Stevens to\ncall the police, and went back outside. Ms. Stevens followed him through the corral\ntoward the car. She came within 10 or 15 feet of the car, and saw the driver’s face when\nhe looked in her direction. After the driver sped away, Ms. Stevens called the sheriff’s\ndepartment from a telephone in the garage to report the suspicious-looking car; she\nwanted the police to know “in case anything happens that we have information.”\n       Mr. Stevens said that, even with binoculars, the Thompson residence and Woodlyn\nLane would not have been visible from the car’s location.\n       Kathy Weese later testified that while she was working for defendant’s company,\non one occasion she saw a station wagon in the parking lot, an older station wagon with\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fout-of-state plates, that had never been in the parking lot before and that she never saw\nagain.\n4. The Murders\n         The prosecution sought to show that Mickey Thompson was executed after\nwatching in horror as the same gunman first put a bullet through his wife’s head, and that\nthis was exactly how defendant wanted it to happen. The evidence was as follows.\n         a. Allison Triarsi – the witness to the murders\n         Fourteen-year-old Allison Triarsi witnessed the murders. The Thompson home\nwas across the street from and down the hill below the Triarsi residence. At 6:00 a.m. on\nthe day of the murders, Miss Triarsi was taking a shower and heard “horrible shrieks and\na lot of screaming” from a high-pitched voice. She also heard multiple gunshots. Her\nmother came in, grabbed her, and pushed her to the floor of the dining room. It had floor\nto ceiling windows, so she could see everything that happened in front of the Thompson\nhome.\n         Miss Triarsi saw Mickey Thompson toward the top of the Thompson driveway, by\nthe garage door. The Thompson minivan was in the driveway with the doors open.\nTrudy Thompson was towards the bottom of the downward sloping driveway. There was\na man with Mr. Thompson who “had a gun and was directing him and making him go in\ncertain directions.” Miss Triarsi heard Mr. Thompson say, over and over, “Please don’t\nkill my wife,” a statement that was directed to another man “at the bottom of the\ndriveway who had a gun and coming towards Trudy.” Mr. Thompson “was extremely\nagitated in his actions. He was moving in an agitated way. He was pleading for Trudy’s\nlife. He was very upset. The man was holding the gun directing the gun at him.”\nMr. Thompson was limping and “holding his body in different locations at different\ntimes,” “trying to stand, but he was struggling to do that.” It appeared Mr. Thompson\nwas trying to go to his wife, and the gunman was “hold[ing] him at bay with an\noutstretched hand with the gun in his hand.”\n         While Mickey Thompson was pleading with the gunman, Trudy Thompson was\non her knees at the bottom of the driveway with her hands “up and out to try to protect\n\n                                            15\n\fherself.” She said, “Please, please don’t kill me.” The gunman closest to Trudy\nThompson walked up close to her and was standing over her. Up to this point,\nMiss Triarsi had not seen anyone shoot a gun. The gunman near Trudy then shot her in\nthe head. She fell to the ground and did not move. Miss Triarsi did not remember what\nthe gunman who shot Trudy did next, “because the next thing I remember Mickey is\ngetting shot.”\n       Miss Triarsi saw Mr. Thompson trying to move toward his wife, “extremely upset;\nscreaming; crying,” and “[h]e ended up getting shot several times next.” “He was shot in\nthe direction of his torso/chest. I remember him grabbing his leg.” Miss Triarsi ran\noutside down the driveway, because she thought Trudy might still be alive. Miss Triarsi\nran to her, but Trudy Thompson never moved and had blood all over her head. Miss\nTriarsi wanted to go to Mickey Thompson, but then she “started to hear more gunshots.”\nShe was “very scared,” and hopped over a stone wall, ducked and waited there. Her\nmother realized where she had gone and was halfway down the driveway, running\ntowards her, when the gunshots rang out. When the police arrived, “we were still\nhiding.” Miss Triarsi never went up to the top of the driveway where Mr. Thompson was\nlying. She did not see either of the gunmen escaping, but she heard a clicking noise, like\na 10-speed bike with thin wheels. The sound came from the direction of the back way\nout of the Thompson property, and grew fainter and fainter.\n       b. Lance Johnson – the witness to the escape\n       A neighbor of the Thompsons, Lance Johnson, was wakened by five or\nsix gunshots. He ran to the window, and after 15 to 20 seconds of silence, he heard\nMickey Thompson loudly screaming, several times, “Please do not hurt my wife.” Then,\nhe heard another series of gunshots, followed by silence. He got out his gun, went to one\nof his front windows, and saw two African-American males riding bicycles (English\nracer bikes) down one of several driveways leading out of the Thompson property, this\none leading to the Thompsons’ barn and Woodlyn Lane. As they started down Woodlyn\nLane in front of his home, he yelled for them to stop, but they did not look in his\ndirection. He then fired a shot at them, but they just pedaled faster. One of them had a\n\n                                             16\n\fsmall bag (about 12 inches long and 4 inches wide) that “went up to a drawstring, . . .\nmore or less pear-shaped,” slung over his shoulder.\n       c. Other witnesses to the escape\n       Wilma Johnson was driving eastbound along Royal Oaks Drive North, at about\n6:00 a.m., and saw two men with bicycles run in front of her van near the intersection\nwith Woodlyn Lane, causing her to brake suddenly. She saw one of them very clearly, a\n“tallish” black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt. They were on foot, pushing 10-speed\nbikes that looked new and shiny, and running diagonally across the street. They\ndisappeared through a break in the fence toward the bicycle path that ran parallel to\nRoyal Oaks on the other side of the fence.\n       Claudette Freidinger was driving through Bradbury, “around 6:00-ish” in the\nmorning, on her way home from taking her son to work. She stopped at an intersection\non Royal Oaks. She saw two black men on good bicycles headed toward her, one with a\nhood and one without, “really, really barreling through the intersection” without stopping\nat the four-way stop. One of them looked in her direction. They were headed\nsouthbound, toward the freeway. (When police interviewed her, Ms. Freidinger said her\nson began work at 7:00 a.m., and expressed doubt about the involvement of the person\nshe saw based on the timing.)\n       d. The escape route\n       The escape route down the back side of the Thompson property to Woodlyn Lane\nwas “a very narrow declining paved road” that “curved and kind of wound” downhill,\nleading to an electronically controlled gate at Woodlyn Lane, and then to Royal Oaks.\nA bicycle would be the perfect vehicle for that road, because “two cars passing each other\nwould have great difficulty.” The gate was electronic, but could be easily opened\nmanually by applying pressure to one of the supporting arms. From there, at Woodlyn\nand Royal Oaks, a bicyclist would be able to pass through a break in the wooden fence\nbordering Royal Oaks, to the running and bike path below. The bike path intersected\nMt. Olive, a few blocks from access to the freeway.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       e. The murder scene and initial investigation\n       When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Trudy Thompson’s body at\nthe base of the steep, downward sloping driveway, and Mickey Thompson’s body toward\nthe top of the driveway, close to the garage door. Both had fatal gunshot wounds to the\nhead, as well as gunshot wounds to their bodies. Trudy Thompson would have been\nvisible to and within speaking distance of Mickey Thompson. A van appeared to have\nreversed into a retaining wall; its door was open, shattered glass from the driver’s door\nwas on the ground, and there was a bullet hole in the windshield.\n       When criminalist Elizabeth Devine arrived a few hours later, she saw money and\njewelry in plain view on the van’s seat. She found shoe prints in several locations, some\nof them from an area where miniature orange trees were planted; she also found freshly\ncut orange peels in the same area. Deputy Sheriff Linda Arthur photographed a stun gun\nthat was in the driveway.5\n       There was a wallet in Mickey Thompson’s pocket with hundreds of dollars in\ncash. Trudy Thompson was wearing high-value gold and diamond jewelry, and there\nwas $3,700 in cash inside her purse in the van. There was no indication of any attempt to\nremove property from either of the Thompsons, no sign of forced entry to the house, and\nthe house alarm was armed and had not been set off. The garage door was closed. There\nwas a safe inside the garage, but no indication it had been tampered with.\n       Detective Reynold Verdugo found expended bullet projectiles and casings at\nvarious locations at the scene, as well as two live rounds. Criminalist Manuel Munoz\ndetermined that all of the expended cartridge casings from the scene were 9-millimeter\nLuger caliber, and two firearms were used. Four expended casings and two live rounds\nwere from the same weapon; the other four expended casings were from a second\nweapon. Two expended bullets removed from Trudy Thompson’s body, one removed\nfrom the van’s passenger door, and one found under Mickey Thompson’s head, were\n\n5     Kathy Weese later testified that she saw a stun gun in a box in a storage area of\ndefendant’s Laguna Beach residence while she was house-sitting there in 1986.\n\n\n                                            18\n\ffired from the same weapon. The others, found inside the garage, near the garage, to the\nleft of Mickey Thompson’s body and inside the van on the driver’s side, were from the\nsecond weapon.\n        Mickey Thompson suffered seven gunshot wounds, three to his stomach, one to\nhis hip, two to the back of his hand, and one to his head, behind his right ear. Trudy\nThompson suffered two gunshot wounds, one to her lower stomach, likely inflicted first,\nwhich could have occurred while she was sitting in the van, and one to the back of her\nhead.\n5. Defendant’s Actions Before and After the Murders: the Yacht and the Gold\n        In December 1987, Diane Goodwin, defendant’s wife, indicated to a bank\nrepresentative that she was in the process of deciding on the purchase of a yacht. In\nJanuary 1988, Ms. Goodwin entered into a purchase agreement with Fraser Yachts for a\n$400,000 yacht, and wrote a check serving as an earnest money deposit for the purchase.\nA boat loan for Ms. Goodwin was approved on March 9, 1988. A seller’s closing\nstatement for the yacht was dated April 28, 1988, and a certificate of ownership dated\nMay 3, 1988, showed Ms. Goodwin as the owner of the yacht, named “Believe,” with a\nmortgage of $200,000 encumbering the yacht.\n        In May 1988, a coin dealer engaged in two transactions he said were with\ndefendant. He believed his initial contact with defendant was by telephone. He sold, in\nthe two transactions, almost $350,000 in gold coins, paid for by cashier’s checks signed\nby defendant’s wife.\n        On June 27, 1988, defendant brought the 57-foot yacht named Believe to a marina\nin South Carolina, managed by Victor Utsey, for installation of bilge pumps and radio\nequipment. The yacht was in the marina for about six weeks. After that outfitting, the\nyacht would have been capable of sailing offshore, such as to the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, or to the Bahamas and South America. The yacht was large enough for\ntransatlantic sail or anywhere in the world, if defendant had the capacity to produce\npotable water, and it was small enough to sail into small waterways and inlets.\nTwo people could live on the boat for an extended period of time. On the second or third\n\n                                            19\n\fday of August, defendant unexpectedly asked Mr. Utsey to expedite the work. Mr. Utsey\ndid so, and defendant sailed away from the marina.\n       In May 1991, a boat surveyor named Frank Magee was retained by Maryland\nNational Bank to repossess defendant’s yacht. He spent three to four weeks in\nGuatemala searching for it. During that time, he had a phone conversation with\ndefendant, who told him “he would never find his boat.” Mr. Magee located the yacht\nand defendant on the Dulce River in Guatemala, and repossessed the yacht for the bank.\n6. The Investigation and Arrest\n       Detective Michael Griggs of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department was\ninitially in charge of the murder investigation. He retired in January 1992. (One of\ndefendant’s claims is that Detective Griggs’s investigation was “derailed” by interference\nfrom Mickey Thompson’s sister.) Sergeant John Yarborough of the “unsolved” unit led\nthe investigation after Detective Griggs retired, and in 1995, Detective Mark Lillienfeld\nwas assigned to take over the investigation.\n       In 1997, Detective Lillienfeld participated in the production of an “America’s\nMost Wanted” show, hoping to identify the two actual perpetrators of the murders. (The\ndetective was also aware that an “Unsolved Mysteries” episode about the murders had\naired in 1988 and several times since then.) At various times in his investigation of\ndefendant, Detective Lillienfeld sought assistance from the DEA, the FBI, Customs, and\nother law enforcement agencies; sought and received authorization for a wiretap of\ndefendant’s telephones; and put defendant under physical surveillance.\n       In 1998, Detective Lillienfeld attended a meeting with the sheriff and the then-\ndistrict attorney, Gil Garcetti. Mr. Garcetti rejected the case against defendant as having\ninsufficient evidence for a successful prosecution. (Goodwin v. Superior Court (Apr. 23,\n2004, G031285) [nonpub. opn.].)\n       In 1999, defendant had a conversation with Randy Garell, the owner of a store\nspecializing in firearms and outdoor apparel and equipment. The two men knew each\nother from an earlier business relationship. Defendant came to Mr. Garell’s shop, and\nwanted to know how guns were traced; Mr. Garell told him. (Defendant told Mr. Garell\n\n                                               20\n\fhe was trying to investigate the Thompson case because he was a suspect, and defendant\n“may have” also said that the detective (presumably Detective Lillienfeld) “was saying\nsome things that were not true about weapons [defendant] may have owned.”) Then, in\nearly 2000, defendant came to the store again and asked if stun guns were traceable.\nMr. Garell said stun guns were not traceable, and did not fall under the same restrictions\nas guns.\n       Detective Lillienfeld also interviewed Gail Moreau-Hunter in March 1999.\nMs. Moreau-Hunter lived with defendant in Colorado in 1991 and 1992. Ms. Moreau-\nHunter told Detective Lillienfeld “she was privy to a conversation in which [defendant]\ntook responsibility for the murders,” but subsequently told the detective that defendant\n“never actually took credit for the crime but merely left that impression with her.”\n(Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285, at p. 9.) (Ms. Moreau-Hunter testified at\nthe preliminary hearing in Los Angeles – but not at trial – that sometime in 1992,\ndefendant showed her a tape of an “Unsolved Mysteries” episode reenacting the\nThompson murders and said, “Look what I’ve done and I got away with it,” and “I hired\ntwo black teenagers to carry out the assassinations.”)\n       In early 2001, Detective Lillienfeld interviewed Ronald and Tonyia Stevens for\nthe first time. They gave the detective the information about the man with binoculars\nparked in front of their house a few days before the murders, as described in part 3, ante.\n(Mr. Stevens had called the police several times, not long after the murders, saying he\nthought he had some information about the Thompson murders; he was told a detective\nwould call him back, but no one ever did.)\n       In March 2001, Mr. Stevens viewed a photographic lineup, or “six-pack.” He had\ndescribed the man with binoculars as “a big man with reddish colored hair and a ruddy\ncomplexion.” He later testified that he saw the person who had been in the car in front of\nhis house in the six-pack. He and his wife were asked to view a live lineup, separately,\nand both of them identified the defendant.\n       In December 2001, Detective Lillienfeld obtained a search warrant for defendant’s\nhome, seizing thousands of documents. Defendant was arrested and charged by the\n\n                                             21\n\fOrange County District Attorney with the 1988 murders and with conspiracy to commit\nmurder.\n       On April 23, 2004, the Court of Appeal issued a writ ordering the trial court to\ndismiss the case for lack of venue.6 The court “emphasize[d] that any new evidence, not\npreviously considered by the Los Angeles District Attorney prior to its rejection of the\ncase, can – and should be – given to the Los Angeles District Attorney for\nreconsideration of that decision, or to the Office of the Attorney General for its review\nand consideration.” (Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285, at p. 34.)\n       The Los Angeles District Attorney charged defendant with the murders, and after\na six-day preliminary hearing in October 2004, defendant was held to answer and\narraigned on October 28, 2004.\n7. The Trial\n       The trial court denied successive motions to dismiss the case, to recuse the Los\nAngeles District Attorney’s office, and to remove the two prosecutors handling the case –\nas delineated in detail post in connection with defendant’s contention these rulings were\nerroneous. Trial began in October 2006.\n       In addition to the facts already described, other evidence was adduced as follows.\n       a. Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony on financial records\n       Karen Stephens-Kingdon was a certified public accountant, an investigative\nauditor for the Orange County District Attorney’s office, and a certified fraud examiner\nand internal auditor. She had previously testified as an expert forensic accountant or\ninvestigative auditor. In early 1992, she was asked to look at the financial records of\ndefendant and his wife to determine “the source of assets and funds and the ultimate\n\n\n6      Defendant had previously sought a writ, after denial of his motion to recuse the\nOrange County District Attorney, alleging a conflict of interest due to that official’s\npersonal relationship with Mickey Thompson’s sister. The Court of Appeal denied that\npetition, allowing defendant “to pursue his assertion that Orange County lacked any\ndisinterested purpose in prosecution.” (Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285, at\npp. 2-3.)\n\n\n                                             22\n\fdisposition of those assets and funds.” She examined thousands of documents from\n1986, 1987 and 1988, and found evidence that funds that had been in defendant’s name\n“ended up in Diane Goodwin’s name.”\n       Ms. Stephens-Kingdon testified that while the yacht Diane Goodwin purchased\nwas in her name, it was “purchased with funds that had been commingled for so many\nyears that this boat purchase was for both Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin.” The Goodwins’\nresidence in Laguna Beach, which they purchased and lived in together, appeared to have\nbeen purchased with commingled assets, and was liquidated (converted into cash or other\nliquid assets) in 1988.\n       Ms. Stephens-Kingdon testified in particular about two investments – JGA\nWhitehawk and Desert Investors – that were in the name of Diane Goodwin in 1988.\nMs. Goodwin put what Ms. Stephens-Kingdon considered to be “commingled funds” of\nboth the Goodwins into those investments in her own name. Then, there was a\ndistribution from JGA Whitehawk to Diane Goodwin for $365,000 on May 6, 1988, and\na few days later, a portion of those funds was used to purchase $275,000 in gold coins,\nand $10,000 was wired offshore. Similarly, $215,000 was distributed from Desert\nInvestors to Diane Goodwin in May 1988; she transferred $140,000 to an account\noffshore and purchased $75,000 in gold coins.\n       In short, “funds that were originally commingled and invested end[ed] up going\noffshore or to purchase gold coins, cash or traveler’s checks.” Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s\nopinion was based on early tax returns, the home in both the Goodwins’ names that was\nliquidated in 1988, and financial and banking records “that were in both of their names\nand then the records show that it all funnels into Diane Goodwin’s name and then . . . the\nfunds go offshore.” She also based her opinion in part on correspondence purporting to\nbe from defendant. One of the letters stated defendant “was handling the entire [Desert\nInvestors] transaction and not to discuss it with Diane because he was handling it” (even\nthough the entirety of the Desert Investors account was in Diane Goodwin’s name);\nanother said certain items should be put in Diane Goodwin’s name because of the\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fThompson issue. (This testimony was admitted only to show the basis for Ms. Stephens-\nKingdon’s opinion.)\n       Ms. Stephens-Kingdon also reviewed bank statements showing that on or about\nMarch 16, 1988 (the date of the murders), there was a $20,000 withdrawal from Diane\nGoodwin’s account, likely as a cashier’s check or cash as there was no personal check.\nMs. Stephens-Kingdon was unable to trace that money; the bank “had no supporting\ndocuments for their record.”\n       b. Evidence of a robbery motive for the murders\n       The defense adduced evidence intended to suggest a robbery motive for the\nmurders. Eric Miller, a friend of Mickey Thompson’s, was with Mr. Thompson the night\nbefore the murders. Mr. Thompson was talking to Lee Haslam about investments.\nSheriff’s Detective Rene Laporte interviewed Mr. Miller about a month after the murders,\nand took notes of the interview. According to those notes (Detective Laporte had no\nindependent recollection of the interview), Mr. Miller told the deputy that “he heard\nMickey Thompson say he had taken possession of a valuable item and named . . . a\nspecific dollar amount.” Counsel asked if Mr. Miller “actually use[d] the words ‘taken\npossession,’ ” and Detective Laporte said, “Yes.” (On cross-examination, he testified his\nnotes were a paraphrasing of the conversation with Mr. Miller.) The notes became part\nof a report that was given to Detective Griggs, who was then managing the investigation.\nDetective Laporte did not, and was not directed to, look into Mr. Thompson’s financial\nrecords to see if he could match up the dollar amount specified with any sort of deposit or\noutgoing notation in those records.\n       Sandra Johnson (Lance Johnson’s wife) saw the two “very dark” men riding\nracing bikes down Woodlyn Lane, and told police that one of them “was carrying a white\ncanvas bag, shopping bag size.” At trial, Ms. Johnson described the bag as “[a] small like\ndrawstring bag,” “10, 12 inches,” “not a great big backpack, but something smaller.”\nRobert Wiborg, a coin dealer, testified that coins shipped via Brinks come in sealed\ncanvas bags, generally white, that look like a regular bank bag and usually have a metal\nseal on the top.\n\n                                            24\n\f       A few weeks after the murders, Detective Gerald Jansen met Mickey Thompson’s\nsister, Collene Campbell, and a locksmith at the Thompson home. Ms. Campbell had\nasked Detective Jansen to accompany her while she had a locksmith break into the safes\nin the Thompson home, so that the deputy could note what was in the safes. The\ndetective’s notes referred to damage to the safe in the garage; he wrote: “ ‘bolt bar bent.\nFresh marks on the locking wheel. Safe empty.’ ” His notes did not indicate whether the\nlocksmith created the damage or pointed it out to Detective Jansen, but he testified that\n“to the best of my recollection, it was after he had opened the safe, that’s the way the safe\nlooked.” He said that if the damage he noted had been there when he arrived, he would\nnot have had the safe opened, and “would have called somebody out to look at it.”\nDetective Jansen would make such notes “[s]o that if somebody says we damaged it more\nthan we actually did to open it, I could say how much we damaged it.” The safe in the\nbedroom closet contained jewelry and two envelopes of money.\n       c. The expert on eyewitness identifications\n       The defense presented testimony from an expert on eyewitness identification,\nDr. Kathy Pezdek. She described the factors that influence the accuracy of eyewitness\nidentifications. Dr. Pezdek opined that a 13-year delay between seeing an individual and\nidentifying him “alone would render such an identification extremely dubious,” and\nindeed that the probability of correctly identifying a person, seen one time very briefly,\nafter 11 months (much less 13 years) is zero. Dr. Pezdek also testified about suggestive\nlineup and identification procedures, as well as the relationship between the accuracy of\nan identification and the confidence of the witness in making it.\n       d. The defense’s firearms expert\n       The firearms expert for the defense, Jacobus Swanepoel, examined the ballistics\nevidence and visited the crime scene. He determined the expended casings came from\ntwo different firearms, but could not make that determination with respect to the fired\nbullets. Based on the placement of expended cartridge cases in relation to expended\nbullets, Mr. Swanepoel opined that both guns were fired at both victims, and Mickey\nThompson likely received his fatal head wound while he was lying down.\n\n                                             25\n\f       e. Investigation deficiencies and inconsistencies\n       The defense produced evidence purporting to show deficiencies in the\ninvestigation of the murders, as well as evidence of inconsistencies between the\ntestimony witnesses gave in court and their previous statements to police investigators.\n              i. Investigative deficiencies\n       Detective Griggs, the lead investigator until January 1992, obtained defendant’s\ntelephone records and set up a database, but did not do the same thing for Mickey\nThompson’s telephones (and neither did Detective Lillienfeld). Detective Griggs did no\nfinancial investigation into defendant or Mickey Thompson or any Thompson family\nmember or employee. Detective Lillienfeld did not attempt to get financial or telephone\nrecords of individuals employed in the Thompson home.\n       There were notes in the original investigation about Arizona license plates on a car\nrelated to a suspect other than defendant. Even after Ronald and Tonyia Stevens told him\nabout the Arizona license plate on the car in front of their house, Detective Lillienfeld did\nnot run the Arizona license plate noted in the investigative file through the computer\nsystem, to find out if that license plate number was associated with a station wagon.\n       Over the years, Detective Lillienfeld was privy to clues involving black men as\nsuspected shooters, but he never showed any photographs of African-American men to\nany witnesses in the case. A hair was removed from the stun gun found at the crime\nscene, but Detective Lillienfeld did not ask for DNA testing on it, nor did he submit the\nfingernail clippings and scrapings taken from the Thompsons for testing. (The defense\neventually tested these items.)\n              ii. Witness inconsistencies\n       In addition to inconsistencies already noted, there were others.\n       When Detective Lillienfeld first interviewed Allison Triarsi in 1997, she told him\nthat she thought the shooter could have been a white man; that she believed her\nrecollection was influenced by her mother; that it was possible Trudy Thompson was shot\nwhile she (Allison) was running down her driveway; and that she had talked to a school\npsychologist about the incident.\n\n                                              26\n\f       When Detective Lillienfeld first interviewed Tonyia Stevens in 2001, she said she\ncould not recall whether or not the car she saw parked in front of her home a few days\nbefore the murders was occupied. She did not tell him that the person she saw in the car\nreminded her of a childhood friend (as she did when she testified in court), and his report\nof her interview took up “maybe two paragraphs.”\n       Deputy Sheriff John Rodriguez, the first officer to arrive on the scene, interviewed\nLance Johnson (who saw the two black men leaving the scene) an hour or so after the\nmurders. Mr. Johnson told him he was awakened by gunshots and “about the same time”\nheard Mickey Thompson screaming to the effect of “ ‘[d]on’t hurt his wife,’ or ‘help,’\nscreaming for help.” Mr. Johnson told Deputy Rodriguez that the shooting stopped and\nthen a few moments later there were several more shots, after which he went outside and\nsaw the bicyclists escaping. Detective Laporte interviewed Mr. Johnson that day, and\nstated in his notes that Mr. Johnson “said he wasn’t sure whether he heard the gunshots\nfirst or the yelling first.”\n8. The Verdicts\n       The jury convicted defendant of both counts of first degree murder on January 7,\n2007, also finding the lying in wait and multiple murder allegations true. The trial court\nimposed consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole, and made other orders\nnot at issue on this appeal.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       We address the issues in the order presented in defendant’s opening brief.7\n\n\n7       After filing his opening brief, defendant requested judicial notice be taken of\n(1) the transcript of the preliminary hearing held in Orange County in 2002; (2) the\ndocket and unpublished decision in Goodwin v. Superior Court, supra, G031285; (3) the\ndocket in People v. Dimascio (case No. G005903) (a case in which Mickey Thompson\ntestified (see pt. 9, post)); and (4) the grand jury testimony of Detective Lillienfeld. We\ntake judicial notice of item (2), the docket and unpublished opinion in Goodwin v.\nSuperior Court, as the trial court expressly referred to it in denying defendant’s request\nfor dismissal based on the delay in prosecuting defendant. We otherwise deny\ndefendant’s request. As to item (3), there is no dispute over the fact that Mickey\nThompson testified in the case, so judicial notice accomplishes nothing. As for the grand\n\n                                            27\n\f1. The Dismissal and Recusal Claims\n       Defendant first contends the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the case, to\nrecuse the district attorney’s office, and to remove the individual prosecutors. These\ncontentions are grounded on the seizure, retention and review of hundreds of attorney-\nclient privileged documents. We find no error in the trial court’s rulings.\n       a. The factual and procedural background\n       On December 13, 2001, police executed a search warrant for defendant’s home in\nOrange County, seizing thousands of documents filling more than 120 bankers boxes.\nOn December 26, 2001, defendant’s then-attorney, Jeffrey Benice, wrote to the Orange\nCounty prosecutor telling him the boxes of documents and computers seized contained\nattorney-client privileged documents, and demanding appointment of a special master to\nprotect defendant’s privilege. The prosecutor declined, observing a special master was\nrequired only when a search warrant sought documents in the possession or control of an\n\n\njury and preliminary hearing transcripts, defendant contends they “are relevant to the\nissues of prosecutorial and police misconduct, . . . presentation of false evidence\nmanufactured by Detective Lillienfeld, and violation of [defendant’s] Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel and attorney-client privilege by both the [Orange County District\nAttorney] and the [Los Angeles District Attorney],” and “contain admissions by\nDetective Lillienfeld, testimony contradicting his trial testimony and testimony\ncontradicting the positions taken by the [Los Angeles District Attorney] at trial.” (See\npts. 1 & 16, post.) If indeed they are relevant, they should have been presented to the\ntrial court in the first instance, and they were not. Defendant’s contention that the trial\ncourt “examined and considered” the grand jury and preliminary hearing transcripts “and\nmade rulings, thus taking judicial notice of them” is not supported by the record. There is\nnothing in the record to show the trial court “examined” these transcripts; there are\nmerely occasional arguments by counsel or testimony referring to the preliminary\nhearing, or to testimony given at that hearing. “Reviewing courts generally do not take\njudicial notice of evidence not presented to the trial court. Rather, normally ‘when\nreviewing the correctness of a trial court’s judgment, an appellate court will consider only\nmatters which were part of the record at the time the judgment was entered.’ [Citation.]”\n(Vons Companies, Inc. v.

That is the case\nhere.\n\n                                             28\n\fattorney. According to defendant, the documents were held by the Orange County\nprosecutors for several months, copied and then most of them were returned to defendant.\n       More than two years later, after the Court of Appeal found venue was improper in\nOrange County, the copies of the seized documents were forwarded to the Los Angeles\nDistrict Attorney’s office. Defendant’s former counsel did not inform his trial counsel of\nthe attorney-client privilege issue, and his trial counsel did not discover it until she\nreviewed the seized documents provided to her in discovery.\n       The documents seized (copies of which were later reviewed by a special master\nappointed by the trial court, as described post) included some 475 pages (by the\nprosecution’s count) that were ultimately found to be attorney-client privileged\ndocuments. The trial court agreed the material was privileged: “It is information\ncommunicated to and from [defendant’s] lawyers; it’s information [defendant] has\ncommunicated to his lawyers in letters back. It does involve his strategies and his\npotential defenses to the charges.”\n       Defendant made a series of motions seeking a remedy for the invasion of\ndefendant’s attorney-client privilege.\n              i. The first motion to dismiss\n       On December 9, 2004, defendant moved to dismiss the case, claiming intentional\nviolation of defendant’s attorney client privilege and citing the power of the court arising\nfrom the due process clause to dismiss a case for outrageous conduct. Defendant claimed\nthat “[f]ew, if any” of the thousands of documents seized were named in the search\nwarrant, and submitted a sampling under seal of 35 documents that were obviously\nprivileged.\n       The motion asserted the authorities were aware when they executed the search\nwarrant that many of the documents in defendant’s home office were privileged\ndocuments. (Defendant told Detective Lillienfeld so when the detective served him with\na grand jury subpoena in March 2001, and defendant posted signs on his office door.)\nThe motion also asserted that Detective Lillienfeld procured the services of Thurston\nMichael (Butch) Jones, who was working as an office assistant for defendant and later for\n\n                                              29\n\fattorney Benice, to provide daily updates “on activities relating to [defendant’s]\npreparation of his defense,” including “reporting on issues he had learned during\nattorney/client conferences.”\n       At the hearing on March 17, 2005, the court stated, as to the 35 samples submitted,\n“I can’t find any evidentiary value to those documents,” and noted that no evidence\npresented at the preliminary hearing came from those documents. The court posed the\npertinent question as whether the Los Angeles District Attorney had evidence that came\nfrom potentially privileged information. The prosecutor made no objection to a court\norder precluding the prosecutor from presenting any evidence derived from potentially\nprivileged communications.\n       Defendant orally requested recusal of the prosecutor as an alternative to dismissal,\narguing that the first time the Los Angeles prosecutors saw an obviously privileged\ndocument, they were obliged to “close the book and to give it to the court, all\n40,000 pages,” and seek appointment of a special master. The court rejected this notion,\nobserving that “the Orange County D.A.’s office probably should have [done something]\nand they didn’t,” but the Los Angeles prosecutor was not made aware of the objections\nthat had been made in Orange County after the seizure, and had no obligation “three or\nfour years after the fact to then bring to the court’s attention the fact that there might be\nsome privileged material.”\n       The court thus denied the motion to dismiss and the recusal request. But, since\nthere were hundreds of other privileged documents, the court ruled the defense could\npresent those to the court under seal, for review by the court or a special master. This\nwould ultimately provide the court with a means of enforcing its tentative remedy: that\nno evidence derived from potentially privileged documents could be used. The court also\nconcluded a hearing would be necessary on the claim that Detective Lillienfeld had\ninterfered with attorney-client privilege by using Butch Jones to report on information\nobtained in attorney-client conferences.\n\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\f              ii. The second set of motions\n       On April 7, 2005, defendant filed motions under seal, including a motion to\ndismiss for egregious governmental misconduct; a motion to recuse the district attorney’s\noffice based on due process, “the inherent conflict of interest created by the review of”\nattorney-client privileged documents, and violation of defendant’s Fourth, Fourteenth,\nFifth and Sixth Amendment rights; and a motion for the return of illegally seized\ndocuments under Penal Code section 1538.5. The court held numerous hearings, with the\nfollowing results.\n       On April 27 and May 16, 2005, the court took testimony from Detective\nLillienfeld, Michael (Butch) Jones, and Attorney Jeffrey Benice with respect to\ndefendant’s claim that the case should be dismissed because Detective Lillienfeld used\nMr. Jones to obtain attorney-client privileged information. The trial court denied that\nbasis for defendant’s motion to dismiss, finding based on the testimony “no intentional\ninterference with the attorney/client privilege . . . .” Mr. Jones “did some running for\nMr. Benice; he did some copying for Mr. Benice and [defendant]. He may have looked\nat some files and obtained some information.” But the court declined to categorize the\nrelationship “as one that is covered by the attorney/client relationship,” and saw no\n“intentional act on the part of law enforcement to interfere with the attorney/client\nprivilege or to obtain privileged material.” “I agree that perhaps there was a question that\ncould have been asked or should have been asked. But that in no way causes me concern\nsuch that I should find the sanction an appropriate remedy, particularly a dismissal.”\n       On May 26, 2005, the Attorney General filed its opposition to defendant’s motion\nto recuse the district attorney’s office, including a declaration from prosecutor Alan\nJackson. Mr. Jackson stated he was the only current employee of the district attorney’s\noffice who had reviewed the material obtained through the search warrant. He stated\nthat, to the extent any document he reviewed was protected by attorney-client privilege,\nhe had not disclosed it to anyone else, nor would he do so in the future. He further stated\nno decisions were made, influenced, affected or impacted by the office’s possession of\nany privileged document; the office had not and would not use any privileged\n\n                                             31\n\finformation; all evidence introduced at trial would be derived from independent sources;\nall pretrial and trial strategy had been and would be based on independent sources; “and\nnothing obtained has had or will have any effect whatsoever on the decisions about the\nscope and nature of the investigation and prosecution, about what witnesses to call (and\nin what order), about what questions to ask (and in what order), about what lines of\ndefense to anticipate in presenting the case-in-chief, and about what to save for possible\nrebuttal.”\n       On June 2, 2005, the court denied defendant’s motion for recusal of the district\nattorney’s office and prosecutors Alan Jackson and Pat Dixon. (The recusal motion was\nbased on the district attorney having seen both privileged documents and documents\nasserted to be beyond the scope of the search warrant.) The court denied the motion\nwithout prejudice, finding no showing of a conflict that would deprive defendant of a fair\ntrial. “The only thing I can say is that the People are in possession of privileged material,\nthat they have agreed . . . not to use . . . in any way and not to use any evidence obtained\nas a result of that material in the trial.” The court said that “if circumstances change, or if\nother facts are developed . . . I’m sure [the defense will] renew that motion and possibly\neven [the] motion to dismiss, but at this point I’m going to deny the [Penal Code section\n1424 (section 1424)] recusal motion.” (Under section 1424, a motion to disqualify a\ndistrict attorney “may not be granted unless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest\nexists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial.”) The\ncourt also observed, as to the section 1538.5 motion for return of property, that the\ndefense had shown there were some materials that were “technically outside the scope of\nthe warrant,” shifting the burden to the prosecution. The court decided to appoint a\nspecial master to determine which documents were privileged and which were beyond the\nscope of the warrant.\n       On January 25, 2006, the defense again moved, under seal, to dismiss the charges\nbased on egregious governmental misconduct, or in the alternative to recuse the entire\ndistrict attorney’s office, or to remove the individual prosecutors. The defense provided a\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\fdetailed analysis of the privileged materials and why the case should be dismissed based\non the prosecutor’s access to the privileged documents.\n       On February 6, 2006, the trial court again refused to recuse the entire district\nattorney’s office, finding “that it wasn’t this D.A.’s office that committed this egregious\nmisconduct,” and the defense had not presented enough “to show that the entire D.A.’s\noffice needs to be recused in this matter . . . .” The court observed it had reviewed the\nprivileged material the special master had segregated. The court reiterated that “I don’t\nbelieve under any scenario we are going to get to a recusal of the entire D.A.’s office,”\nbut that a hearing should be held on the possible recusal of the two prosecutors. (The\nprosecutor had had no access to the sealed pleadings, and no opportunity to respond to\nthe defense claim that the prosecution’s theory of the case was altered in light of the\nprivileged information.) The court also reiterated its finding that “I don’t think that we\nhave egregious misconduct on the part of this prosecutorial agency such that the court\nwould have to dismiss the case as a sanction,” and indicated that “in a perfect world,\nperhaps [prosecutor Jackson] should step aside.”\n       At a hearing on February 15, 2006, on the recusal issue, prosecutor Jackson\nreported that his office declined the court’s suggestion he step aside. The court found no\ndisabling conflict of interest under section 1424, but believed it had “the inherent\nauthority to disqualify a prosecutor who has been tainted by attorney/client privilege\nmaterial.” The court decided prosecutor Jackson should review the privileged documents\ncited and analyzed in the defendant’s recusal request, so that he would have the\nopportunity to demonstrate that the privileged material had already been disclosed to\nothers such that the court could find a waiver of the privilege.\n       The prosecutor then filed, for a hearing on March 6, 2006, a detailed analysis of\nthe documents the special master concluded were privileged, arguing that “defendant has\nnot, and cannot, establish that he has suffered any prejudice as a result of [Deputy District\nAttorney] Alan Jackson’s review of the claimed privileged documents.” The prosecutor\ndescribed the documents and categorized them as either (1) documents with no facial\nindication that they were protected communications; (2) nonprejudicial as not pertaining\n\n                                             33\n\fto the Thompson murders; or (3) documents to which waiver applied because the subject\nmatter had been published in alternate, unprivileged sources. The prosecutor attached\nvarious publications, including a transcribed interview from “America’s Most Wanted,”\nas well as defendant’s memorandum to the producers of that television show, and\nconcluded defendant “has systematically published in almost every media forum\navailable his thoughts, theories, defenses, excuses, accusations, analyses and beliefs\nsurrounding the Thompson murders.”\n       At the March 6 hearing, the court expressed doubt that it had inherent authority to\nrecuse the district attorney (as opposed to authority under section 1424), and ruled:\n“[G]iven what the People have presented to the court by way of, No. 1, that there was a\nwaiver; No. 2, the issue of the documents being irrelevant and third argument that there\nwas no prejudice, . . . I think the People’s response addresses the court’s concerns and I\ndon’t know at this point that I’m prepared to go any further assuming I have inherent\nauthority to recuse the DA to enforce the order that I made earlier. I am not prepared to\ngo that way.” And, “even assuming I do [have inherent authority], . . . there has been no\nsubstantial showing of prejudice which would warrant the court taking that next step\n[removing prosecutor Jackson]. I think the remedy that I imposed earlier in these\nproceedings is adequate.” And, “I think I can guarantee that the attorney-client\nprivileged material is not used.” “I am basically saying that based on what I have now,\nall of the available information to me including now all of the information that I have\nseen that is in the public domain — let me put it that way. Not that it is not privileged,\nbut it is information in the public domain and so based upon all of the available\ninformation that I have as of this moment, I am not prepared to take a step that I think is a\ndrastic step that does implicate separation of powers arguments and is a remedy that I\nwould have been prepared to utilize in the appropriate case. This is not the appropriate\ncase given all of the available information I have before me and so that is where I am at.”\n              iii. The motion to exclude witnesses’ testimony\n       In May 2006, defendant filed a motion to exclude the trial testimony of\n12 witnesses, including Phillip Bartinetti, Dolores Cordell, Jeffrey Coyne, and Karen\n\n                                             34\n\fStephens-Kingdon – and in the alternative, again renewed its recusal and removal\nmotions. The named witnesses were the “financial witnesses,” and defendant argued that\n“by calling the financial witnesses, the prosecutors would be changing theories of the\ncase based upon the content of [defendant’s] privileged documents [(the ones that\npertained to the ‘federal fraud litigation’)].” (In 1993, defendant was charged in federal\ncourt with bankruptcy and loan fraud, and was ultimately convicted of making false\nstatements to a financial institution. According to defendant, some of the named\nwitnesses “were part of the driving force behind [defendant’s] prosecution for federal\ncrimes relating to his bankruptcy,” and they “will be the prosecutor’s main witnesses to\ntry to establish ‘motive’ for these murders.”) “The blueprint of his defense to the\nfinancial allegations has been exposed. His thought processes and conduct relating to his\nhandling of the civil judgment and bankruptcy have been exposed. His right to testify on\nhis own behalf has been compromised as he is now going to have to face a prosecutor\nwho is armed with information that he received outside the bounds of the rules governing\nfair trials.”\n        The prosecutor challenged the defense to point to “anything that establishes that\nthe defendant has suffered a prejudice so bad that he cannot receive a fair trial if I call\nany of those witnesses who deal with his financial status.”\n        The court heard and denied defendant’s motion on June 20, 2006. The court\npointed out its earlier order on the prosecutor’s obligation not to use any privileged\nmaterial or any material derived from it. “So I assume that that order has been taken\nseriously by the People. I assume that the People are calling witnesses that they were\nplanning on calling all along. And that they did not obtain any new information from\ntheir accidental review of the privileged material. So correct me if I’m wrong on that.”\n        The court concluded: “I think that the People’s position has actually a great deal\nof merit based on what I have reviewed and what I ruled on in the previous litigation in\nterms of whether or not they are able to comply with my order. I think they are. And the\nremedy was that they were not permitted to use evidence obtained from the privileged\nmaterial. And they say they are not. [¶] And I guess until we get to a point during trial\n\n                                              35\n\fwhere the defense wants to renew their motion based on testimony, I don’t know what\nelse I can do pretrial in that regard. I mean it’s an unfortunate situation I think we all\nagree. But we really kind of resolved this issue before. And I don’t think there is any\nneed for any additional sanction. Because that’s what is being requested here is that the\ncourt exclude testimony. [¶] The court will not exclude testimony that’s otherwise\nrelevant at this trial. And it does appear that the financial motive is the motive in this\ncase. And the court doesn’t believe that there has been a sufficient showing to warrant\nthe recusal of these prosecutors from this case. But, again, the court has the ability to\nmonitor and enforce the court’s previous order. And that will be done.”\n       b. The law\n       We begin our discussion of the legal basis for rejecting defendant’s dismissal and\nrecusal claims with a few prefatory comments. We share the trial court’s recognition that\ncertain of the conduct that occurred in Orange County in connection with defendant’s\nattorney-client privileged documents appeared to have been, in the trial court’s words,\n“egregious misconduct.” We do not condone or countenance those actions. But\nestablished principles of law govern our review of claims that a criminal proceeding\nshould be dismissed or prosecutors recused on that account.\n       As our narration of the proceedings in the trial court shows, the court took great\ncare in its assessment of the circumstances surrounding the seizure, retention and review\nof the privileged documents, entertaining renewed motions, engaging a special master,\nand holding multiple hearings as the defense developed its evidence and theories. The\ntrial court gave meticulous attention to the evidence and arguments presented. In so\ndoing, it plainly appreciated the gravity of the underlying invasion of defendant’s\nattorney-client privilege, and showed skepticism about claims of prosecutorial ignorance\nof privileged matters. We have done so as well in our independent review of the record.\nBut in the end, we cannot gainsay the trial court’s conclusions that “it wasn’t this D.A.’s\noffice that committed this egregious misconduct,” and that the necessary showing of\nprejudice to defendant’s right to a fair trial was absent.\n       We turn to our discussion of defendant’s several different but related claims.\n\n                                              36\n\f              i. Dismissal for outrageous governmental misconduct\n       Defendant contends the case should have been dismissed based on outrageous\ngovernmental misconduct that violated his due process rights. He asserts the district\nattorney was accountable for “the outrageous misconduct of the investigators and the\nprosecutors, both in Orange County and in Los Angeles,” and the trial court erred in\nconsidering only the Los Angeles prosecutor’s conduct. Specifically, defendant asserts\nthe district attorney was responsible for the conduct of Detective Lillienfeld of the Los\nAngeles Sheriff’s Department, who headed the search team that seized the documents in\nOrange County and who “could not have missed the sign on [defendant’s] home office\ndoor asserting attorney-client privilege and directing police to his attorney . . . .”\nDefendant argues that, just as the prosecutor is responsible for any nondisclosure of\nfavorable evidence under Brady v. Maryland (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Brady), including\nevidence known to anyone acting on the government’s behalf, the prosecutor here is\npresumed to be responsible for the violation of defendant’s attorney-client privilege,\nwhether committed by government agents from Orange County or Los Angeles. And,\ndefendant says, dismissal is required whether or not he can demonstrate prejudice.\n       Defendant is mistaken on all counts.\n       First, we note the standard of review. “The determination of whether the\ngovernment engaged in outrageous conduct in violation of defendant’s due process rights\nis a mixed question.” (People v. Uribe (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 857 (Uribe).) A\ndeferential standard of review applies to the factual determination of whether and to what\nextent misconduct occurred. (Id. at pp. 857-858.) Whether the governmental conduct\n“constitutes outrageous conduct in the constitutional sense of violating defendant’s due\nprocess rights” is primarily a legal question. (Id. at p. 858 [“the trial court’s finding that\nthe governmental conduct was outrageous in violation of defendant’s due process rights\nthereby warranting dismissal is subject to independent review”].)\n       Second, where a defendant seeks dismissal for outrageous governmental acts,\n“a showing of prejudice to defendant’s right to a fair trial [is] required and . . . the\nabsence of such a showing preclude[s] dismissal as a sanction for prosecutorial\n\n                                               37\n\fmisconduct.” (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 861; id. at p. 865 [prosecutor’s\nmisconduct “was certainly conscience-shocking in the sense that it involved false\ntestimony by a prosecutor in a formal criminal proceeding,” but “it did not involve ‘brutal\nand . . . offensive’ conduct employed to obtain a conviction”; the defendant “was not\nentitled to dismissal for outrageous governmental conduct shocking the conscience in\nviolation of substantive due process”]; see also United States v. Morrison (1981)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110372\"><a href=\"/opinion/110372/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367, 362, 365-366 (Morrison) [the high court, while “not condon[ing] the\negregious behavior of the Government agents” – who met with the defendant without the\npermission or knowledge of her counsel, disparaged her counsel and told her she would\nface a stiff jail term if she did not cooperate – concluded that dismissal of the indictment\nwas “inappropriate where the violation . . . has had no adverse impact upon the criminal\nproceedings”; “absent demonstrable prejudice, or substantial threat thereof, dismissal of\nthe indictment is plainly inappropriate, even though the violation may have been\ndeliberate”].)\n       In this case, the trial court found there was no “egregious misconduct” by the Los\nAngeles prosecutors in the first place. Specifically, the court found that “it wasn’t this\nD.A.’s office that committed this egregious misconduct,” and that the Los Angeles\nprosecutor was not made aware of the objections that had been made in Orange County\nafter the seizure, and so had no obligation “three or four years after the fact to then bring\nto the court’s attention the fact that there might be some privileged material.”\nSubstantial evidence supported the trial court’s findings.\n       It was undisputed that the Los Angeles District Attorney had nothing to do with\nthe search of defendant’s home. There was no evidence that prosecutors Jackson or\nDixon relied on any privileged materials to make any decision in the trial of the case (and\nthere was evidence otherwise, in the form of Mr. Jackson’s declaration). Mr. Jackson\nalso told the court at a hearing: “I looked at tons of stuff, and I don’t remember looking\nat any attorney/client privilege stuff until [defense counsel] gave it to me. And it’s only\nthe items she’s given to me. I have not gone back and filtered through 60-odd boxes or\n40-odd boxes of stuff to look for other things.”\n\n                                             38\n\f       The trial court later reviewed the privileged material the special master had\nsegregated, and reiterated its earlier finding of no egregious misconduct by the\nprosecutors. Still later, the court repeated that once the case came to Los Angeles, there\nhad been no misconduct on the part of the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office.\nDefendant identified no privileged document relied on by the prosecutors to his prejudice\n(or at all), either at trial or on appeal.\n       Defendant is left to argue that the prosecutor may be taxed, for purposes of a claim\nof outrageous governmental misconduct, with actions taken or not taken by the Orange\nCounty prosecutor’s office. There is no pertinent authority for that notion, and we reject\nit. Defendant cites Brady and its progeny for the principle that the prosecutor is\nresponsible for disclosing evidence favorable to the defense, and that duty includes the\n“duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government’s\nbehalf in the case.” (Kyles v. Whitley (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437; In re Brown (1998)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 879 (Brown) [courts have focused on the “ ‘ “ ‘prosecution team,’ ” ’ ”\nand “any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government’s behalf is\nimputed to the prosecution”].)\n       But the legal authorities on outrageous government misconduct do not employ the\n“prosecution team” principle, nor is there reason to do so. A Brady violation can be\nremedied only by providing the defense with the exculpatory material. Without the\n“prosecution team” principle, the prosecutor could “ ‘ “avoid disclosure of evidence by\nthe simple expedient of leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another\nagency while utilizing his access to it in preparing his case for trial,” [citation].’\n[Citations.]” (Brown, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 879.)\n       That principle has no logical application in the context of an outrageous\nmisconduct claim. Case authority likewise supports the conclusion that a prosecutor is\nnot chargeable with the outrageous misconduct of another agency. (See People v.

In contrast, the record before this court\ncontains substantial evidence of such participation on the part of a deputy district\nattorney.”].)\n       Defendant points out that the detective who headed the search team in Orange\nCounty was a member of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, and he “led the charge\nthat resulted in the wholesale seizure” of attorney-client privileged documents. But the\ntrial court expressly found the search warrant was properly executed. And while\ndefendant broadly claims the prosecutor’s “seizure, retention and review of the privileged\nmaterial” requires dismissal, he presents no argument supported by legal authorities for\nthe proposition that the warrant was improperly executed in the first instance.\n       Even if we were to hold the Los Angeles prosecutors responsible for all that went\nbefore, it would avail defendant nothing. “[A] showing of prejudice to defendant’s right\nto a fair trial [is] required” to sustain a due process claim of outrageous government\nconduct requiring dismissal. (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 861.) Defendant cites\nseveral California cases where dismissal of charges was upheld or required based on\nflagrant interference in defendant’s attorney-client relationship. But in all of them, not\nonly was the prosecutor complicit in an intentional interference between attorney and\nclient, but prejudice appeared on the face of the matter.\n       Neither factor applies here. In Boulas, for example, law enforcement officers,\nwith the tacit approval of the prosecutor, undermined the defendant’s relationship with\nhis attorney by telling the defendant that he had to fire his attorney and retain another\nattorney in order to secure a plea bargain. (Boulas, supra, 188 Cal.App.3d at p. 427.)\n“We find it to be beyond [peradventure] that the . . . course of conduct undertaken by law\nenforcement officials actively caused irremediable harm to Boulas’s relationship with his\nattorney and was, therefore, improper.” (Id. at p. 433.) Boulas points out that the high\n\n                                             40\n\fcourt in Morrison, which found dismissal an improper remedy in that case, “did not rule\nout the possibility of ordering the dismissal of a case upon a proper showing of\nprejudice.”8 (Boulas, at p. 431.) But there was no such showing here.\n       Defendant argues that prejudice may be presumed where the privileged documents\nto which the prosecutor has access “contain details of the defendant’s trial strategy,”\nciting federal cases where government informants participated in attorney-client\nconferences and provided the prosecution with confidential information about the\ndefense’s strategy or position. (E.g., United States v.

There, an undercover\npolice officer posing as a codefendant attended confidential attorney-client conferences\nwith the other defendants (the district attorney knew he was a police officer and did not\ninform defense counsel). This was a violation of the right to counsel, and there was\nprejudice: “there was evidence that since the disclosure of [the officer’s] undercover\nrole, [the other defendants] had become reluctant to cooperate fully with their attorney.”\n(Id. at p. 755.) Dismissal was the appropriate remedy: “Whether or not the prosecution\nhas directly gained any confidential information which may be subject to suppression, the\nprosecution in this case has been aided by its agent’s conduct. [Codefendants] have been\nprejudiced in their ability to prepare their defense. They no longer feel they can freely,\ncandidly, and with complete confidence discuss their case with their attorney.” (Id. at\np. 756.)\n\n9      In any event, those authorities are split on the question whether a deliberate\nattempt by the government to obtain defense strategy information or to otherwise\ninterfere with the attorney-defendant relationship through the use of an undercover agent\nconstitutes a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment.

By contrast, in Levy the court specifically identified the defense strategy\nlearned by the prosecutor.10\n       Here, instead of pointing to any defense trial strategy or tactics that were revealed\nin the privileged materials, defendant argues the trial court’s remedy – the order not to\nuse privileged information at trial – was “impossible to enforce,” and it was “unrealistic\nto believe” the prosecutors did not use privileged information to their advantage.\nDefendant points to “between 150 and 200 pages” of privileged documents relating to\ndefendant’s federal criminal case (not to the murders). That case involved alleged\nbankruptcy fraud, and at the murder trial, the prosecutors called witnesses who testified,\nas mentioned previously, about transactions undertaken to move defendant’s business\nassets without paying the creditors, the transfer of assets to defendant’s wife, and so on.\nDefendant cites the testimony of these witnesses as showing “at least one critical instance\nof actual prejudice,” claiming the prosecutors used the privileged communications that\n\ninterfere with the attorney-client relationship, as reprehensible as it was,” did not amount\nto a constitutional violation of the right to counsel; “the existence or nonexistence of\nprejudicial evidence derived from an alleged interference with the attorney-client\nrelationship is relevant in determining if the defendant has been denied the right to\ncounsel”].)\n\n10      In Levy, the government learned that the defense intended to dispute the credibility\nof the government’s key witnesses, and “thereby necessarily became privy to the fact that\nthis was the only likely defense strategy that the prosecution had to anticipate.” (Levy,\nsupra, 577 F.2d at p. 208.) The government witnesses were two black men who claimed\nto be present at a private club where drug transactions took place, and “[t]he defense\nstrategy obviously would be to discredit the black witnesses by attempting to establish\nthat blacks were never admitted to that private club. The government’s knowledge of this\nplanned strategy would permit it not only to anticipate and counter such an attack on its\nwitnesses’ credibility, but also to select jurors who would be more receptive to the\ntestimony of black witnesses against white ethnic defendants.” (Ibid.)\n\n\n                                             42\n\fpertained to the federal criminal proceedings “in formulating the prosecution’s case for\nmotive,” and “chang[ed] theories of the case based upon the content of [defendant’s]\nprivileged documents.” (The Orange County prosecutors charged defendant with\nconspiracy and murder for financial gain, and defendant claims, without citing to any\nparticular documents, that his communications with his lawyer exposed the fallacy in the\nnotion that defendant stood to gain financially from Mr. Thompson’s death.)\n       But this is pure speculation. Defense counsel admitted below that “I can’t say\nwhether [the prosecutors] read these documents and therefore changed their mind. I can’t\nsay if they just are a little bit more on the ball than the district attorneys in Orange\nCounty. I can say that the appearance of impropriety is large.” Speculation, without\nreference to any supporting evidence, does not suffice, and it seems obvious the question\nof financial gain or its absence could be investigated and determined without regard to\nprivileged communications. Defendant points to nothing to show the prosecutors used\nany privileged document, or evidence derived from a privileged document, and the\nprosecutor avers none of the documents were used to make any prosecutorial decision.\nAs for the financial witnesses, they were intimately involved in the bankruptcy litigation,\nthus accounting for their trial testimony. There was no showing they were privy to any\nprivileged documents, and defendant does not attempt to trace any testimony to a\nprivileged source. Dismissal cannot be based on unsupported speculation.11\n\n\n\n11     Defendant also cites a Connecticut opinion, State v. Lenarz (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nwhere the court “conclude[d] generally that prejudice may be presumed when the\nprosecutor has invaded the attorney-client privilege by reading privileged materials\ncontaining trial strategy, regardless of whether the invasion of the attorney-client\nprivilege was intentional,” and the state may rebut that presumption by clear and\nconvincing evidence. (Id. at p. 425.) California cases do not so hold, and in any event, in\nLenarz, the court found both that the privileged materials “contained a detailed, explicit\nroad map of the defendant’s trial strategy” (id. at p. 451); “the defendant was prejudiced\nby the prosecutor’s intrusion into the privileged communications” (id. at p. 442); and the\nstate had the burden to prove that any prejudice could be cured by a less drastic remedy\nthan dismissal (id. at pp. 443-444), which it could not do in that case (id. at p. 445). No\nsimilar findings were made, or could have been made, here.\n\n                                              43\n\f       Defendant also cites Morrow v.

There, the court held: “Where a prosecutor orchestrates courtroom\neavesdropping on a privileged attorney-client communication and the witnesses thereto\ninvoke the privilege against self-incrimination, the prosecution may not successfully\noppose a motion to dismiss on the ground that no prejudice has been shown.” (Id. at\np. 1258.) In those circumstances, “the court’s conscience is shocked and dismissal is the\nappropriate remedy. Even when the issue is narrowed to a Sixth Amendment violation,\ndismissal is still appropriate because here there is a ‘substantial threat of demonstrable\nprejudice’ as a matter of law.” (Id. at p. 1251, citing Morrison, supra, 449 U.S. at\np. 365.) This case bears no comparison to Morrow; here, the prosecutor engaged in no\nmisconduct, and indeed demonstrated to the satisfaction of the trial court that nothing in\nthe privileged materials was or would be used to the prejudice of defendant. (See Shrier,\nsupra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 405, 417 [exclusion of overheard communications and any\nderivative evidence was the appropriate remedy for eavesdropping on attorney-client\ncommunications where prosecutor was unaware of the eavesdropping plan].)\n       In sum, substantial evidence supported the trial court’s conclusion that the\nprosecutors here engaged in no misconduct, and that in any event their review of\nattorney-client privileged material did not result in the prejudice to defendant that is\nnecessary to justify the sanction of dismissal. Our independent review of the record\nconfirms the absence of any “outrageous conduct in the constitutional sense of violating\ndefendant’s due process rights . . . .” (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 858.) And\nthere was no showing of any use of privileged documents or information derived from\nthem by the prosecutors in trying the case. In short, the required showing of prejudice to\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial was absent and precluded dismissal. (Id. at p. 861.) As\nthe high court said in Morrison, “[c]ases involving Sixth Amendment deprivations are\nsubject to the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the\nconstitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests,”\nand “[o]ur approach has thus been to identify and then neutralize the taint by tailoring\nrelief appropriate in the circumstances to assure the defendant the effective assistance of\n\n                                             44\n\fcounsel and a fair trial.” (Morrison, supra, 449 U.S. at pp. 364, 365.) That is exactly\nwhat the trial court did here.\n               ii. Recusal issues\n         Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motions to recuse the Los\nAngeles District Attorney’s office, or to remove prosecutors Jackson and Dixon from\ndefendant’s prosecution. We review this claim “only for an abuse of discretion.”\n(Hariguchi v. Superior Court (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569097\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569097/haraguchi-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711-712, fns. omitted (Hariguchi)\n[“The trial court’s findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence, its conclusions\nof law are reviewed de novo, and its application of the law to the facts is reversible only\nif arbitrary and capricious.”].) We find no abuse of discretion.\n         Under section 1424, a motion to disqualify a district attorney “may not be granted\nunless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely\nthat the defendant would receive a fair trial.” (Id., subd. (a)(1).) Section 1424 establishes\n“a two-part test: (i) is there a conflict of interest?; and (ii) is the conflict so severe as to\ndisqualify the district attorney from acting? Thus, while a ‘conflict’ exists whenever\nthere is a ‘reasonable possibility that the DA’s office may not exercise its discretionary\nfunction in an evenhanded manner,’ the conflict is disabling only if it is ‘so grave as to\nrender it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nEubanks (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594, 583-584 (Eubanks) [substantial financial assistance\nvictim provided to district attorney’s office resulted in a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest].) “The statute demands a showing of a real, not merely apparent, potential for\nunfair treatment, and further requires that that potential ‘rise to the level of a likelihood of\nunfairness.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Vasquez (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633534/people-v-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (Vasquez).) The\ndefendant “bear[s] the burden of demonstrating a genuine conflict; in the absence of any\nsuch conflict, a trial court should not interfere with the People’s prerogative to select who\nis to represent them.” (Hariguchi, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 709.)\n         We have already recited at length, in connection with defendant’s dismissal\narguments, the relevant facts. Those facts lead to the same result: no error by the trial\ncourt.\n\n                                                45\n\f       Here, the trial court repeatedly found that no conflict existed. In June 2005: “The\nonly thing I can say is that the People are in possession of privileged material, that . . .\nthey agreed not to use that material in any way and not to use any evidence obtained as a\nresult of that material in the trial,” and “there is no showing that the defendant would\nreceive anything other than a fair trial based on the possession of this information.” In\nFebruary 2006: “But I am convinced of what I said a month ago. I don’t believe this is a\n[section] 1424 situation.” In March 2006: “This is not a [section] 1424 situation in my\nopinion and I think I have been consistent in saying that.”\n       Defendant fails entirely to identify any conflict of interest, merely repeating his\nclaim that the “prosecution team intentionally and illegally invaded the defense team” by\nseizing and reviewing privileged communications and “us[ing] them to form their\ntheories of the case.” First, as we have seen, that is not a proper characterization of the\nprosecutor’s conduct; the prosecutor saw privileged communications, but his conduct was\nnot intentional, and he did not “use them to form [the prosecution’s] theories of the case.”\nAs the Supreme Court has said, “[t]he trial court was entitled to credit [the prosecutor],\nand his statements constitute substantial evidence.” (Hollywood v. Superior Court (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567545\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567545/hollywood-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 (Hollywood).) Second, defendant showed no conflict of interest – no\n“ ‘reasonable possibility that the DA’s office may not exercise its discretionary function\nin an evenhanded manner.’ [Citation.]” (Eubanks, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 594.)\n       Vasquez explains the point: public prosecutors “are required to exercise their\ndiscretionary functions “ ‘ “with the highest degree of integrity and impartiality.” ’\n[Citation.] Impartiality, in this context, means . . . that the prosecutor is ‘expected to\nexercise his or her discretionary functions in the interests of the People at large, and not\nunder the influence or control of an interested individual.’ [Citation.]” (Vasquez, supra,\n39 Cal.4th at p. 55 [because of a close family relationship between longtime employees\nof the prosecutor’s office and the defendant, there was a “ ‘reasonable possibility that the\nDA’s office may not exercise its discretionary function in an evenhanded manner’ ”]; see\nalso Hollywood, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 731 [trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding no cognizable conflict of interest under section 1424, where prosecutor disclosed\n\n                                              46\n\fcase files to filmmaker and acted as a consultant on a movie about the defendant’s life\nand alleged crimes; “[w]hile in the abstract it is conceivable a fear of criminal sanctions\nmight alter how [the prosecutor] handled this case, the trial court found [the prosecutor]\ncredible and concluded the possibility that confidential documents might have been\ndisclosed inadvertently would not prevent [the prosecutor] from acting fairly toward [the\ndefendant]”; that conclusion “does not appear arbitrary or capricious and is supported by\nsubstantial evidence”].)\n       Defendant cannot explain how the prosecutor’s exposure to privileged materials\ncreated a conflict of interest such that the prosecutor might not exercise his discretionary\nfunctions in an evenhanded manner. As Hollywood tells us, “section 1424 does not exist\nas a free-form vehicle through which to express judicial condemnation of distasteful, or\neven improper, prosecutorial actions. [S]ection 1424 offers no relief for actions simply\nbecause they appear, or are, improper. [Citations.] The Legislature has closely defined\nthe limits of judicial authority to recuse prosecutors, and we must observe them. . . .\nA defendant must identify, and a court must find some conflict of interest that renders it\nunlikely the defendant will receive a fair trial.” (Hollywood, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 735,\nfn. omitted.) The trial court found none here, and we can find no abuse of its discretion\nin that finding.\n       Defendant next argues that, apart from Penal Code section 1424, the court had\ninherent power under Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(4) to remove\nprosecutors Jackson and Dixon. Under that statute, every court has the power to “compel\nobedience to its judgments, orders, and process,” and to “control in furtherance of justice,\nthe conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected\nwith a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto.” (Code Civ.\nProc., § 128, subd. (a)(4)&(5).) But section 1424 now specifies the requirements for\ndisqualification, and it was enacted in response to the case which established that\nsection 128 gives the court power to remove a prosecutor.

Superior Court\n(Greer) (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433608\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433608/people-v-superior-court-greer/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 [concluding, before the enactment of section 1424,\nthat “a trial judge may exercise his power to disqualify a district attorney from\n\n                                             47\n\fparticipating in the prosecution of a criminal charge when the judge determines that the\nattorney suffers from a conflict of interest which might prejudice him against the accused\nand thereby affect, or appear to affect, his ability to impartially perform the discretionary\nfunctions of his office”]; see Eubanks, supra, 14 Cal.4th at pp. 590-591 [section 1424\nallows disqualification “only when a conflict ‘render[s] it unlikely that the defendant\nwould receive a fair trial,’ [citation] whereas Greer allowed disqualification even when\nthe conflict might merely ‘appear to affect’ the prosecutor’s fairness”].) But the point is\nthat “a conflict of interest which might prejudice [the prosecutor] against the accused”\n(Eubanks, at p. 591) is required for recusal, and there was no such conflict in this case.\n       Even in a case where the circumstances present a conflict of interest, the conflict\nwould be disabling only if it makes it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.\n(Eubanks, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 594.) That returns us to the point we have already\ndecided in connection with defendant’s claim the trial court should have dismissed the\ncase for outrageous government misconduct: There was no showing of prejudice to\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial, so any conflict of interest that might be identified under\nsection 1424 would not render it “ ‘unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.’\n[Citation.]” (Eubanks, at p. 594; see also People v.

In short, there was no error in the court’s refusal to recuse\nthe prosecutors.\n       Finally, defendant makes one other point. He contends the right to counsel is\nviolated when a state agent is present at attorney-client conferences, and that Detective\nLillienfeld obtained privileged information by “using someone from the defense camp as\na spy for several weeks,” and “knew Butch Jones was providing him information\nMr. Jones had gleaned from his presence at attorney-client conferences.” In this\nargument, defendant fails to acknowledge that the court took testimony from defendant’s\n\n                                              48\n\fthen-lawyer (Jeffrey Benice), from Detective Lillienfeld, and from Mr. Jones, and found\notherwise.\n       Specifically, the court found there was no “intentional act on the part of law\nenforcement to interfere with the attorney/client privilege or to obtain privileged\nmaterial.” “There may have been some relationship that existed between Mr. Jones and\nMr. Benice, but I can’t say that Detective Lillienfeld attempted to intentionally obtain\nprivileged information from that relationship by virtue of his contact with Mr. Jones.”\nDetective Lillienfeld testified that Mr. Jones told him on one occasion that defendant was\ngoing to meet with Mr. Benice on defense strategy, but he never indicated that he\n(Mr. Jones) attended any such meeting, and “the contents of that meeting” were never\nsupplied to Detective Lillienfeld. Mr. Jones also told the detective, who confirmed the\ninformation, that defendant, not Mr. Benice, paid Mr. Jones, whose job was as a runner, a\nmessenger, and a researcher for defendant. Mr. Benice testified that, at defendant’s\nsuggestion, he paid Mr. Jones once or twice to review and obtain documents from case\nfiles concerning Mickey Thompson’s estate, but Mr. Jones did no substantive legal work\nfor him, and he did not invite Mr. Jones into strategy meetings. And Mr. Jones testified\nthat he never supplied Detective Lillienfeld with information he gleaned from meetings\nwith defendant and Mr. Benice.\n       In short, substantial evidence supported the trial court’s finding that there was no\nintentional interference with the attorney-client relationship through the use of Mr. Jones\nas an informer – in contrast to both cases defendant cites.

Defendant made the same argument\nto the trial court: “Every decision that they’re [(the prosecutors)] going to make cannot\nbe said to now not be derived from the reading of those documents,” and “[t]here is\nsimply no way for anyone to know what parts of the case that form Mr. Jackson’s\nthoughts on prosecution were derived from these letters.” That is simply not the law.\n       There was no error in the trial court’s denial of defendant’s motions to dismiss or\nto recuse the prosecutors.\n2. The Insufficient Evidence Claim\n       Defendant claims the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. This\nargument includes two principle components: first, that there was no evidence of any\nassociation or agreement between defendant and the killers (and hence “no corpus\n[delicti] to prove a conspiracy”) and second, the eyewitness identification testimony of\nRonald and Tonyia Stevens was not “substantial, credible evidence [defendant] engaged\nin a conspiracy to murder the Thompsons.” Defendant is mistaken.\n       “When the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction is challenged on\nappeal, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to\ndetermine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\nfrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. [Citation.] ‘Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion\ndo not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge\nor jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon\nwhich a determination depends.’ [Citation.] Unless it describes facts or events that are\nphysically impossible or inherently improbable, the testimony of a single witness is\nsufficient to support a conviction.” (People v.

So, “ ‘if the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we must accord due\ndeference to the trier of fact and not substitute our evaluation of a witness’s credibility for\nthat of the fact finder.

Defendant was not charged with conspiracy. He\nwas charged with murder. To convict a defendant of a crime, the prosecutor must prove\nthat a crime – “the corpus delicti or body of the crime” – actually occurred, and the\nprosecutor may not rely exclusively on the defendant’s extrajudicial statements to do so.\n(People v.

As the facts we have\nrecited show, the occurrence of the crimes with which defendant was charged – multiple\nmurders committed by means of lying in wait – is not open to question.\n       Conspiracy was merely one of the theories of liability by which the prosecution\nsought to establish that defendant was responsible for those crimes. There is no support\nin the authorities or in logic for the proposition that the corpus delicti rule may be applied\nto a theory of liability. The rule “is intended to ensure that one will not be falsely\nconvicted, by his or her untested words alone, of a crime that never happened.” (Alvarez,\nsupra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1169.) The two charged murders happened – and once there is\nindependent evidence of a crime, “the defendant’s extrajudicial statements may then be\nconsidered for their full value to strengthen the case on all issues.” (Id. at p. 1171.) That\nis so here.\n       And so we turn to the substance of defendant’s claim: whether there was\ninsufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant conspired to kill\nthe Thompsons. A conspiracy is an agreement to commit the crime, and the essence of\ndefendant’s claim is that there was no evidence of any association with, or agreement\nwith, the unknown killers to commit the murders – the sine qua non of conspiracy. He\npoints out that a legal inference cannot flow from the nonexistence of a fact, and may not\nbe based on suspicion or conjecture or guesswork. (People v.

While defendant tells us what evidence was absent (such as evidence of\npayments to the shooters, telephone records, witnesses to defendant’s solicitation of the\nmurders, meetings or talks with the shooters), he ignores the evidence that was adduced.\nThe Thompsons were killed in a carefully planned operation for which there was no\nrobbery or other motive (ante, pp. 15-19). Defendant was present in the neighborhood\nwith binoculars and another person a few days before the murders (ante, pp. 13-14). The\nshooters knew where and when to find the Thompsons, how to get to their house, and\nhow best to escape the scene (ante, pp. 16-18). Defendant repeatedly threatened to kill\nMickey Thompson and hurt his family (ante, pp. 6-13) and indeed made statements to\ntwo witnesses about the cost involved in having Mr. Thompson killed (ante, pp. 8-9), and\ntold others he was too smart to get caught (ante, p. 7). These facts were placed in\nevidence, and the jury could properly infer from them that defendant agreed with the\nshooters to commit the murders.\n       To this, defendant’s answer is to characterize defendant’s presence near the\nThompson home as a “highly speculative ‘fact’ ” that was “not sufficient,” even if the\nStevenses’ eyewitness identifications were credible, which he claims they were not.\nNeither of these arguments assists defendant. He says his presence in the neighborhood\nshortly before the murders “is simply too tenuous and speculative” to support a finding of\n\n                                             52\n\fan agreement to commit murder. In the abstract and without any other evidence,\ndefendant might be right – but there was other evidence (delineated in the preceding\nparagraph), and defendant ignores it. As the jury was instructed, properly, the “formation\nand existence of a conspiracy may be inferred from all circumstances tending to show the\ncommon intent . . . .”12\n       At its core, defendant’s argument is that the eyewitness testimony of Ronald and\nTonyia Stevens is not substantial, credible evidence, and without it he cannot be\nconnected to the murders. We disagree with defendant’s premise.\n       Defendant recites at length various inconsistencies between the Stevenses’\ntestimony at trial and their testimony at the preliminary hearing and interviews with the\npolice. (These inconsistencies include statements about the race of the passenger in the\ncar with defendant, how far away Mr. Stevens was when he saw defendant, for how long\nand at what angle he saw defendant, and so on.) Defendant challenges the photographic\nand live lineup procedures as “suggestive and unreliable.” He points out that in the\nphotos, there was only one man “that had any sort of pock marks.” He says Mr. Stevens\nadmitted on cross-examination that he had pointed to three different photos, saying “this\ntype of nose” and “that type of hair” and “this type of complexion,” and that\nDetective Lillienfeld posed the question, “Yeah, but the guy you saw in the wagon that\n\n\n\n\n12       Defendant relies on United States v. Todd (8th Cir. 1981) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393355\"><a href=\"/opinion/393355/united-states-v-bobby-todd/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where the\ndefendant’s conviction for murder was affirmed but his conviction for conspiracy to\nmurder was reversed. The only evidence of conspiracy to murder was that all the\nprincipals (defendant, his alleged coconspirators, and the victim) were members of the\nsame basic training company at Ft. Leonard Wood, and defendant said he and his alleged\ncoconspirators intended to rob the victim. The court held it was improper to convict\ndefendant of conspiracy to murder based on an assumption that they also intended to\nmurder the victim so he would not identify them after the robbery. (Id. at p. 217\n[“Although the government is allowed to prove an agreement by circumstantial evidence,\n. . . here there is only speculation and inference.”].) We fail to see any favorable\ncomparison between the evidence in this case, where defendant stated his intent to kill\nMr. Thompson and discussed hiring someone to do so, and the speculation in Todd.\n\n\n                                            53\n\fday that most resembles who in this photo array now?” rather than admonishing\nMr. Stevens that the suspect might or might not be in the photo array.\n       Mr. Stevens viewed a live lineup five months later, where defendant was the only\nperson whose photo was also in the photographic lineup, and the only person with pock-\nmarked skin. (Tonyia Stevens also viewed that lineup, separately, and identified\ndefendant. She had seen defendant on a newscast (footage of four to six men walking out\nof a courtroom, with no mention of defendant’s name) and recognized him as the person\nshe saw in the car before the murders; at the time, she told her husband she was sure he\nwould remember him too.) Defendant also cites numerous cases and studies discussing\nthe unreliability of eyewitness identifications and suggested reforms in identification\nprocedures. And he cites the many other factors that reduce the reliability of\nidentifications: lapse of time (13 years), limited opportunity to observe, intervening\ninfluences affecting memory (such as reenactments of the crime on television), and so on.\n       Nonetheless, Mr. and Ms. Stevens did in fact testify that it was defendant they saw\nwith binoculars in an old station wagon with Arizona license plates parked near their\nhome a few days before the murders. And Kathy Weese offered some corroboration\nwhen she testified that while she was working for defendant’s company, on one occasion\nshe saw an older station wagon with out-of-state plates in the parking lot; it had never\nbeen there before and she never saw it again. The jury heard all this evidence, including\nall the inconsistencies defendant cites, and also heard testimony from defendant’s expert\nwitness on eyewitness identifications, explaining all the factors supporting the\nunreliability of identifications made under the circumstances existing in this case. The\njury also heard defendant’s arguments about the unreliability of the Stevenses’\nidentifications. It was for them to decide whether or not they believed the Stevenses’\ntestimony.\n       In his reply brief, defendant contends the issue is “not about reassessing witness\ncredibility,” but about the “inherent unreliability of eyewitness identifications obtained\nunder circumstances that corrupt human memory,” as shown in the studies he cites\n(studies not presented to the trial court). But we are bound by the law as stated by the\n\n                                             54\n\fSupreme Court, and that court has expressly rejected claims that eyewitness testimony\nwas unreliable “because the witnesses’ initial descriptions of the perpetrator were\ninconsistent and because the identification testimony was tainted by suggestive lineups\nand photo arrays, and by the passage of time.” (Elliott, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 585\n[“Inconsistencies in [the witnesses’] initial descriptions of the perpetrator and any\nsuggestiveness in the lineups or photo arrays they were shown are matters affecting the\nwitnesses’ credibility, which is for the jury to resolve.”]; see also In re Gustavo M.

In short, we\nnecessarily decline defendant’s invitation to hold as a matter of law that the Stevenses’\nidentifications were unreliable.\n       In sum, though the jury could have disbelieved the Stevenses’ testimony, for all\nthe reasons defendant presented to it, the jury chose to believe them. Their testimony\nconstitutes substantial evidence, and it was not the only evidence connecting defendant to\nthe crime, as we have already pointed out; there was evidence of a carefully planned and\ncoordinated execution and escape that required research and reconnaissance, defendant’s\nrepeated statements of intent to kill Mickey Thompson and hurt his family, and\nstatements about the cost of having Mr. Thompson killed. From all this evidence, the\njury could reasonably infer an agreement by defendant with the shooters to commit the\nmurders.\n       Finally, we note that, in his motion for a new trial, defendant presented an\naffidavit from the jury foreperson, saying, among other things, that he was initially\nreluctant to vote for conviction because of no evidence “connecting [defendant] to the\nactual killers, even though most of the other evidence pointed towards guilt”; that the\nconspiracy instruction allowed the jury to infer from “all of the other incriminating\nevidence” that defendant wanted Mickey Thompson dead “and could have hired the\nkillers to commit the crime even though no evidence of a connection between the\nconspirators was presented”; and, since the jury concluded it was reasonable to believe\n\n                                             55\n\fdefendant “could have been responsible,” “we felt we reconciled that lack of connection\nto the killers by applying the instruction on conspiracy, which allowed us to infer that\nconnection.”\n       We may not consider these statements (which in any event appear merely to\nreflect defendant’s mistaken notion that a direct – rather than circumstantial – link\nbetween defendant and the actual killers must be shown). Under Evidence Code\nsection 1150, “[n]o evidence is admissible . . . concerning the mental processes by which\n[the verdict] was determined.” (Id., subd. (a); see People v. Gonzales (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1234</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1281 [“The jurors’ statements about the mental processes by which that verdict was\nreached were expressly barred by . . . section 1150.”].) The trial court, we note,\nnevertheless considered the foreperson’s declaration, saying it “tend[ed] to agree that . . .\nprobably a portion of it got into what is prohibited by [section] 1150,” but “I’m\nconsidering that declaration and accepting it at face value.” Nonetheless, the trial court\nconcluded that, while “this was a circumstantial evidence case with nothing – no direct\nevidence to connect [defendant], . . . the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming.”\nWe agree.\n3. The Delay in Prosecution\n       Defendant was arrested on December 13, 2001, for murders that occurred in\nMarch 1988, and his preliminary hearing in Los Angeles occurred in October 2004. In\nJanuary 2006, defendant filed a motion to dismiss because of the lengthy delay, and\nasked the court to defer ruling on the motion until completion of the trial. The trial court\ndid so, and ultimately denied the motion.\n       Defendant contends on appeal the delay in prosecuting him was unjustified and\nprejudicial: that the evidence offered at the trial in 2006 was “essentially identical to\nwhat the [Los Angeles District Attorney] could have mustered for trial soon after the\nkillings in 1988,” and in the interim, “the defense evidence faded away almost\ncompletely.” We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\ndefendant’s motion.\n\n\n\n                                             56\n\f          a. The governing principles\n          The pertinent legal principles are these. The due process clauses of the federal and\nCalifornia Constitutions “protect a defendant from the prejudicial effects of lengthy,\nunjustified delay between the commission of a crime and the defendant’s arrest and\ncharging.” (People v. Cowan (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801948/people-v-cowan/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (Cowan).) “ ‘ “[T]he right of\ndue process protects a criminal defendant’s interest in fair adjudication by preventing\nunjustified delays that weaken the defense through the dimming of memories, the death\nor disappearance of witnesses, and the loss or destruction of material physical evidence.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) “ ‘ “A defendant seeking to dismiss a charge on this\nground must demonstrate prejudice arising from the delay.

While “the federal constitutional standard for what\nconstitutes sufficient justification for delay is unclear [citation], we have noted that ‘the\nlaw under the California Constitution is at least as favorable for defendant in this regard’\nas federal law [citation].”13 (Id. at pp. 430-431.)\n          “Under the California standard, ‘negligent, as well as purposeful, delay in bringing\ncharges may, when accompanied by a showing of prejudice, violate due process.

Nelson observed that the high court has said that “ ‘the\nFifth Amendment requires the dismissal of an indictment, even if it is brought within the\nstatute of limitations, if the defendant can prove that the Government’s delay in bringing\nthe indictment was a deliberate device to gain an advantage over him and that it caused\nhim actual prejudice in presenting his defense,’ ” but that some of the high court’s earlier\ncases “suggest the test might be somewhat less onerous.” (Id. at pp. 1253-1254.)\n\n\n                                               57\n\fto the balancing process. Purposeful delay to gain an advantage is totally unjustified, and\na relatively weak showing of prejudice would suffice to tip the scales towards finding a\ndue process violation. If the delay was merely negligent, a greater showing of prejudice\nwould be required to establish a due process violation.’ [Citation.] The justification for\nthe delay is strong when there is ‘investigative delay, nothing else.’ [Citation.]” (Cowan,\nsupra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 431.)\n       “We review for abuse of discretion a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for\nprejudicial prearrest delay [citation], and defer to any underlying factual findings if\nsubstantial evidence supports them [citation].”14 (Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 431.)\n       b. The trial court’s ruling\n       Defendant’s position is that the trial court erred in finding justification for the\ndelay, and in addition that the court “skipped the third step – balancing prejudice against\nthe prosecutor’s justification – altogether.” Thus, defendant contends, because the\nprosecutor’s showing of justification was “insubstantial,” if defendant showed “even\nminimal prejudice, the trial judge’s error in not undertaking the required weighing\nrequires reversal.”\n       We do not agree with either point in defendant’s analysis. To begin, we describe\nthe court’s ruling in some detail. We then review defendant’s claims of prejudice (pt. c.,\npost) and the prosecutor’s justification (pt. d., post), and conclude there was no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court’s refusal to dismiss the case for prearrest delay.15\n\n14     Defendant compares this case to People v. Cromer (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585551\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585551/people-v-cromer/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and\nconcludes we must employ de novo review. Cromer was not a case of prearrest delay. In\nCromer, the court held that appellate courts “should independently review a trial court’s\ndetermination that the prosecution’s failed efforts to locate an absent witness are\nsufficient to justify an exception to the defendant’s constitutionally guaranteed right of\nconfrontation at trial.” (Id. at p. 901.) Cowan was decided years after Cromer, and its\nstatement of the standard of review on a motion to dismiss for prearrest delay could not\nbe clearer.\n\n15     Defendant says he was “substantially handicapped” in preparing and arguing the\nprearrest delay issue in the trial court, because the court refused to order daily transcripts.\nHe does not, however, identify any evidence in the record that he did not bring to the trial\n\n                                              58\n\f          Some of the trial court’s comments suggest its belief that a legitimate reason for\nthe delay in prosecution would be dispositive, without regard to defendant’s showing of\nprejudice. But the court did in fact find prejudice to defendant (and to the prosecution, as\nwell) from the delay, and a fair reading of its analysis shows an implicit, if not explicit,\nbalancing of the prejudice against the justification.\n          After first correctly rejecting the prosecutor’s contention that a defendant must\nshow intentional delay by the government, this is what the trial court said: “[T]o prevail\non due process grounds . . . the defense has to show some actual prejudice by the delay.\n[¶] Once the defendant shows some actual prejudice, . . . the burden shifts and the court\nhas to find that there was no legitimate reason for the delay.” The court then said that the\nsecond question was the easiest to answer, and it would answer that first: “There appears\nto me to be ample reason why this case took so long to result in an arrest of\n[defendant]. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . [S]imply based on the evidence that I heard at this trial,\nthere were new witnesses that came forward in 2001. It appears that . . . Ron and\nTonyia Stevens made an identification in 2001 and although they attempted to contact\nlaw enforcement before, the fact of the matter is that the identification was not made until\n2001.” The judge also mentioned Gail Moreau-Hunter’s information, presented at the\npreliminary hearing but not at trial, that defendant made a statement to her “where he at\nthe very least suggested that he was responsible for the murders.” The court observed\nthat when the new information – the identifications and Ms. Moreau-Hunter’s statements\n– was obtained in 2001, the sheriff’s department did not delay in presenting the case for\nfiling.\n          The court then said: “There were ample reasons for the delay. And I think that, in\nand of itself, is dispositive, I will be honest with you. I think that the court doesn’t have\nto even address the first question [prejudice]. [¶] But for purposes of this record, let me\ngo ahead and attempt to at least clarify what I think the standard is. I don’t know that\n\n\ncourt’s attention, or that he was unable to bring to the court's attention because he did not\nhave daily transcripts.\n\n\n                                               59\n\fthere is any authority for the proposition that the court has to assume that every witness\nthat was unavailable for the trial would have presented testimony favorable to the\naccused. [¶] . . . [¶] . . . I don’t know that any of the evidence that was not presented\nbecause of the delay would have been beneficial to the defendant. But what I can say is\nthat the evidence that was presented at the trial by the prosecution was certainly hindered\nby the delay.” (Boldface & italics added.)\n       The court noted the case was aggressively defended, with the defense doing an\n“excellent job in presenting to the jury . . . the problems inherent in a lot of the testimony\npresented by the People. [¶] And those problems were in large part due to a lack of\nrecollection; a lack of physical evidence that may have existed in this case. So the\nbottom line I think it’s fair to say the delay did not just prejudice – potentially prejudice\nthe defense. The delay prejudiced I think both sides in this case. And that’s unfortunate.\nBut I’m not going to assume that every witness that wasn’t called would have testified\nfavorably . . . for [defendant]. [¶] However, even . . . if I make that assumption, I then\nget to that second question: was there a legitimate reason for the delay? Whereby the\nanswer is yes. [¶] So no matter how I look at it, given the legal standard that I believe\napplies on this case, I have made inquiry into whether or not there was prejudice. I agree\nthere was prejudice, but there was a legitimate reason for the delay.”\n       The court pointed out that the Court of Appeal in Orange County, when it ruled\nvenue was not proper there, “did point out this new evidence that was presented or\ndiscovered,” and “practically begged Los Angeles to take another look at this case.” The\ncourt continued: “I think there was ongoing investigation. I know that Detective\nLillienfeld took over the case and pursued the case. And I can’t fault anyone for the fact\nthat it took so long to actually get enough evidence to file the case. And at the behest of\nthe Court of Appeal that’s what the L.A. County District Attorney did. [¶] So given all\nof that, I do not believe that there has been anything that rises to the level of due process\nviolation here. . . . [F]rom what I can glean from the cases that have been cited, the due\nprocess violation has not been established.”\n\n\n\n                                               60\n\f       It thus appears that the court, while not expressly balancing the prejudice to\ndefendant against the justification for the delay, implicitly did just that: The court plainly\nconcluded it could not fault anyone for the length of time that elapsed in the investigation\nbefore the authorities charged defendant. And the court further concluded, correctly, that\nit would be wrong to assume that every unavailable witness would have provided\ntestimony favorable to defendant. Indeed, the court went so far as to observe that “I don’t\nknow that any of the evidence that was not presented because of the delay would have\nbeen beneficial to the defendant.” (Italics added.) Based on these findings by the court,\nthe balancing of prejudice against justification could have only one result.\n       And so, the question for us is whether the trial court abused its discretion in\nmaking those findings and concluding there was no due process violation. We think not,\nand turn first to defendant’s showing of prejudice.\n       c. Defendant’s claims of prejudice\n       Defendant asserts prejudice from the loss of material witnesses, loss of\ndocumentary evidence, and witnesses’ failing memories. We address his claims of\nprejudice in the order he has raised them. Our conclusion is that, as the trial court found,\ndefendant demonstrated some prejudice, sufficient to require justification by the\nprosecution for the delay, but the demonstrated prejudice was, on the whole, minimal.\n              i. The Arizona license plate number\n       Defendant first claims prejudice from the loss of the Arizona license plate number\nof the car in which Mr. Stevens saw defendant a few days before the murders.\nMr. Stevens made a note of the license plate number, but by the time defendant was\narrested, he could no longer find it. Defendant asserts the license plate number would\nhave “exonerated” him, or “at the very least would have confirmed he had no connection\nwith the station wagon the Stevenses described.” That is pure speculation.

Defendant’s alibi evidence and the Stevenses’ memories\n       Defendant contends if the investigators had interviewed the Stevenses in 1988,\n“there would have been fewer influences distorting the Stevenses’ memories, and\n[defendant] would have been in a position to present an alibi.” He says that by the time\nof the trial, the Stevenses could not pinpoint the date they saw him parked in front of their\nhouse, and defendant’s “1988 day-timers and personal notes were lost, depriving him of\nhis opportunity to prove alibi.” Similarly, defendant could have established his alibi by\nproducing credit card and financial receipts, but by the time he was charged, these\ndocuments had already been destroyed in the normal course of business. Defendant says\nthese records would also have demonstrated a consistent spending pattern during the\nweeks prior to and after the murders.\n       This lost evidence too is speculative. As for the Stevenses’ memories, defendant\nhad a full opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses on this point and did so; their\n“distort[ed]” memories were fully explored at trial and any prejudice could at most be\n\n16      The Hartman case illustrates a showing of “actual prejudice based on the facts of\nthe case.” (Hartman, supra, 170 Cal.App.3d at p. 579.) There, the medical examiner at\nthe original autopsy found death by natural causes. A year later, an independent\npathologist concluded the death stemmed from a homicide, although the actual cause of\ndeath could not be determined, and the several experts hired by the victim’s widow\nexpressed new but conflicting interpretations of the cause of death. Finally, “six years\nafter the second autopsy . . . and without the discovery of any new or additional evidence\nsince then,” the defendant was charged with murder. By then, both the medical examiner\nand the supervisor who supported his finding had died, and were thus unable to explain\nthe medical examiner’s findings at trial, or to rebut the implication by other witnesses\nthat he had been negligent. In addition, the victim’s brain had been misplaced after the\ninitial autopsy, and the heart had disappeared after the second autopsy, making it\nimpossible to resolve the medical inconsistencies among the experts at trial. The court\nfound actual, substantial prejudice to the defendant, and the five-and a-half-year delay in\nprosecution after the new expert evidence became available “was without any\njustification whatever.” (Id. at p. 583.) As will become apparent, this is not a\ncomparable case, in terms of either prejudice or justification.\n\n\n                                             62\n\fminimal. And with respect to the lost alibi evidence – daytimers, personal notes, credit\ncard receipts and so on – defendant had every incentive to preserve that information. As\nhe told the trial court below, he “was a named suspect within hours of the murder.” (See\nCowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 432 [rejecting the defendant’s argument that, 10 years\nlater, he could not identify alibi witnesses or recall what he was doing during the first few\nweeks of September 1984; “defendant was aware by at least February 1985 . . . that he\nwas a suspect in the . . . murders”; he “therefore had an incentive to record any\nexculpatory information he had regarding his whereabouts, . . . or the identity of alibi\nwitnesses”].)\n                iii. Information about improper influences on Detective Griggs’s\n                     investigation\n\n       Defendant contends that Mr. Thompson’s sister, Collene Campbell, improperly\ninfluenced and interfered with Detective Griggs’s investigation of other viable suspects,\nfrom the time of the murders until the detective retired in 1992. By the time defendant\nlearned of this alleged interference, most of the information in Detective Griggs’s\npersonnel file had been destroyed (further to the internal policy of the Los Angeles\nCounty Employees Retirement Association (LACERA)), and Detective Griggs was\nuncooperative. Once again, defendant only speculates that the file contained relevant\ndocuments, the destruction of which was “extremely prejudicial” to him. In any event,\ndefendant did not make this claim in his motion to the trial court, and cannot do so for the\nfirst time on appeal. (People v. Accredited Surety & Casualty Co. (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1134</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1146 [appellant is precluded from raising a new theory for the first\ntime in its appeal].)\n                iv. Telephone records\n       Kathy Weese and Joel Weissler testified about threats defendant made over the\ntelephone, including when Mr. Thompson called defendant’s office. By the time\ndefendant was charged, the telephone companies had purged records, so that the defense\ncould not obtain telephone records for the homes and offices of defendant,\nMr. Thompson and Mr. Weissler. Again, we have only speculation; there is no reason to\n\n                                             63\n\fassume these telephone records would have contradicted, rather than substantiated, the\nwitnesses’ testimony. “To avoid murder charges due to delay, the defendant must\naffirmatively show prejudice.” (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1250.)\n               v. John Williams’s testimony about towing defendant’s Mercedes\n       Mr. Williams testified to defendant’s threats on Mr. Thompson’s life that occurred\nwhen Mr. Williams seized defendant’s Mercedes to collect on Mr. Thompson’s\njudgment. The documentation, including Mr. Williams’s notes of the altercation, were\npurged, so defendant could not impeach Mr. Williams with his own notes (to establish\nthat the incident occurred in 1986, rather than shortly before the murders in 1988, and to\nestablish that no altercation was noted). But defendant was able to produce other,\nundisputed evidence that the towing occurred in 1986 (a receipt from the towing\ncompany and other documentation). Mr. Williams was thoroughly cross-examined and\nimpeached with the documents on the issue of when the levy occurred, so the purged\nnotes would have been cumulative – and defendant’s claim that those notes did not\nmention an altercation is complete speculation. So any prejudice from loss of the notes\nwas minimal.\n               vi. Lawyers’ records\n       Fee details and records kept by Mr. Thompson’s lawyers and lawyers for the\nbankruptcy estate were no longer available by the time defendant was charged. These\nrecords allegedly would have shown whether or not the meeting Mr. Coyne testified to,\nduring which defendant threatened Mr. Coyne, actually took place and whether defendant\nwas present. The fee details about phone calls “could have been used to impeach the\nwitnesses who testified about outbursts heard after calls they assumed to be between\nGoodwin and his own or Thompson’s attorneys.” Once again, defendant offers no reason\nto assume these records would contradict, rather than substantiate, the witnesses’\ntestimony.\n               vii. Locksmith records\n       Detective Jansen testified that to the best of his recollection, the damages to the\nsafe in the Thompsons’ garage, mentioned in his notes, was created by the locksmith\n\n                                             64\n\fwhen he opened the safe, rather than pointed out by the locksmith before he opened the\nsafe. By the time of trial, defendant was unable to impeach Detective Jansen with the\nlocksmith’s records – which “presumably . . . would have noted the date of service and\nany damage the company had caused to a private individual’s safe.” This, too, is only\nspeculation – both as to whether and how long any such records are kept and as to what\nthey would have shown – not an affirmative showing of prejudice.\n                    viii. Allison Triarsi’s diary\n       At the preliminary hearing in 2004, Miss Triarsi, the only eyewitness to the\nkillings, testified that she kept a journal when she was very young “and wrote down the\nspecific events which I ended up showing to a psychiatrist where I documented what I\nhad seen.” She said she had not located her journal when she first talked to Detective\nLillienfeld in 1997, but had located it later, “I don’t know, five years ago.” She said her\njournal “gave me the evidence in my mind that these are the things that I saw.” She\ntestified the journal was at her parents’ home, and the defense subpoenaed the diary after\nthe preliminary hearing, but her mother told the defense she did not have it and had not\nseen it in years.\n       Defendant contends the loss of the diary was “extremely prejudicial,” as the diary\n“likely effectively superseded her memory of the events themselves”; because of the\nprosecutor’s delay, defendant was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Miss\nTriarsi using the diary, which “was crucial to his defense.”17 Defendant fails to identify\nany respect in which the diary might have been “crucial to his defense.” At trial,\ndefendant’s counsel elicited that Miss Triarsi told Detective Lillienfeld in 1997 that “one\nor the other of the killers could have been white,” whereas at trial she testified she did not\nknow the race of the gunmen.\n       Again, any prejudice from loss of the diary appears quite speculative. The race of\nthe killers was established with the testimony of other witnesses. Defendant relies on\n\n17     Defendant also claims that records from Miss Triarsi’s school counselor were\nunavailable, and “might have shown Allison to be fantasizing,” but his citations to the\nrecord do not show any attempt in the trial court to obtain these records.\n\n                                                    65\n\fRoss v. United States (D.C. Cir. 1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"268786\"><a href=\"/opinion/268786/howard-ross-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213-214 (Ross), where the court\nfound a delay in prosecution prejudicial. There, the sole witness to a drug transaction\nwas the undercover drug purchaser, who had no personal recollection of the transaction\nand testified based entirely on his notebook recording his drug transactions. The court\nfound a purposeful seven-month delay between offense and arrest, a plausible claim by\nthe defendant of inability to recall or reconstruct the events on the day of the offense, and\na trial in which the entire case consisted of one witness’s recollection refreshed by his\nnotebook. (Id. at pp. 212, 215.) That is nothing like this case, where Miss Triarsi had an\nindependent memory of the shooting, and others testified to hearing the same screams\nfrom the victims and to seeing the shooters as they escaped. (Cf. Harrison v. United\nStates (D.C. 1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258143\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258143/harrison-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1240-1241 [observing that precedential value of Ross\nwas questionable in view of more recent authority].) In short, again there is only\nspeculation that the diary might have contained something with which to impeach Miss\nTriarsi’s eyewitness account of the murders.\n              ix. Evidence of Mickey Thompson’s gold purchase\n       According to the investigative notes of Detective Rene Laporte, Eric Miller, a\nfriend of Mickey Thompson’s, told police that the night before the murders, he heard\nMickey Thompson say he had taken possession of $250,000 in gold. (The jury was told\n“a valuable item” in “a specific dollar amount,” rather than $250,000 in gold.) According\nto counsel, federal law at the time required registration of such an acquisition with the\nInternal Revenue Service, but those records were purged in 1995 and unavailable to the\ndefense. Defendant argues that if he had been prosecuted in a timely fashion, he would\nhave had an opportunity to prove, in connection with his theory the murders occurred\nduring a robbery, that Mr. Thompson purchased gold and it was unaccounted for after the\nmurders.\n       This lost evidence might conceivably have been relevant. But there was no basis\nto believe that any gold Mr. Thompson might have purchased had been delivered to his\nresidence, no suggestion how the shooters would have found out about Mr. Thompson’s\ngold purchase, and no evidence of forced entry into the Thompson residence. So, while\n\n                                             66\n\fthe possible evidence of a gold purchase may have been relevant, the prejudice arising\nfrom its absence appears minimal.\n              x. Unavailability of witnesses\n       Defendant identifies several witnesses, dead or otherwise unavailable by the time\nof trial, who might have provided relevant evidence, as follows.\n                     A. Unidentified people involved in the Joey Hunter investigation\n       A man named Joey Hunter was seen by several witnesses “hitchhiking frantically\nwith a bicycle at a bus stop,” about two and a half miles from the crime scene and less\nthan an hour after the murders. The original investigators followed up and arrested\nMr. Hunter, who failed polygraph tests regarding his involvement in the Thompson\nmurders. Defendant says Joey Hunter “suddenly and inexplicably ceased to be a\nsuspect,” and by the time of defendant’s prosecution, “people who were involved in the\nJoey Hunter investigation had died.” (The Joey Hunter evidence was proffered by the\ndefense (and excluded by the trial court) to establish that someone other than defendant\narranged the murders (see pt. 9, post).)\n       This contention was not raised in the trial court, and therefore cannot be raised on\nappeal. In any event, defendant does not specify the nature of the testimony these\nunidentified individuals would have given if they had been available as witnesses, instead\nmerely asking us to assume that an investigative decision not to pursue Mr. Hunter as a\nsuspect was based on something other than lack of evidence. This is unvarnished\nspeculation, and does not show prejudice.\n                     B. Yacht broker William Redfield\n       Mr. Redfield assisted defendant’s wife in her search for a yacht and, according to\ndefendant, would have testified she began searching months before the murders, and was\nexpecting a distribution of JGA/Whitehawk funds that would cover all her expenses.\nMr. Redfield would also have testified to the structure of the payments for the deposit on\nthe boat, thereby explaining the prosecution’s attempt to allege that $20,000 was not\naccounted for. (Defendant provides no citation to the record for this last point, but\napparently is referring to testimony from Karen Stephens-Kingdon, who testified about\n\n                                             67\n\fMs. Goodwin’s withdrawal of $20,000 from her account on March 16, 1988;\nMs. Kingdon-Stephens could not trace this money, and testified it was likely a cashier’s\ncheck or cash. Defendant pointed out that the yacht deposit consisted of checks for\n$11,000 and $20,000.)\n       This testimony is again hypothetical, but assuming its substance, it would have\nbeen relevant to the defense. Its absence, however, appears only marginally prejudicial.\nThe parties stipulated to testimony from a bank employee that a letter from Diane\nGoodwin dated December 24, 1987, months before the murders, stated she was in the\nprocess of deciding which yacht she was interested in purchasing. And the point about\nexpected distribution of JGA/Whitehawk funds to cover the yacht purchase has little\nsignificance, as the point of Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony was that the\nJGA/Whitehawk investment was funded by assets belonging to defendant and\nMs. Goodwin, not Ms. Goodwin alone. So overall, any prejudice was not substantial.\n                     C. Sable Reeves, the Thompsons’ housekeeper\n       According to defendant, witnesses testified the Thompsons left for work together\nevery morning. (Defendant does not cite this testimony, and we have not found it,\neither.) Ms. Reeves, however, told police the Thompsons rarely drove in the same car to\nwork together, Trudy Thompson was often at home alone when she arrived, and\nMr. Thompson usually had already gone to work by 6:00 a.m. Ms. Reeves would also\nhave been able to testify about whether valuables were missing.\n       We consider this testimony inconsequential. Even if Mr. Thompson typically left\nfor work earlier than he did on the day of the murders, there is nothing to show the killers\nwere not lying in wait at that earlier time. Nor is there anything to contradict the\nprosecution argument that the timing of the shooting was inconsistent with a typical\nresidential burglary, where the perpetrators tend to choose times when the residents are\nlikely to be absent. And hypothetical testimony about “whether valuables were missing”\nis completely speculative.\n\n\n\n\n                                             68\n\f                     D. Tom Villelli\n       Mr. Villelli was Baron Wehinger’s stepfather. Mr. Wehinger testified, for the first\ntime at trial, that Mr. Villelli and defendant discussed the price of hit men in 1984. In his\npreliminary hearing testimony, Mr. Wehinger did not mention the discussion of the price\nof hit men; he simply testified that he overheard defendant saying that “he would have\nMickey Thompson taken care of if he lost his court battles with him.” He also said this\noccurred two or three months before the murders, but then on cross-examination, when\nasked if the conversation occurred in 1987, said “I believe so,” and then when asked, “Or\n’86?” Mr. Wehinger answered, “’86, it had to be earlier, yeah.”\n       Defendant says that “Wehinger never indicated before trial the conversation had\noccurred in 1984 and [defendant] and Villelli discussed the price of hit men.” Defendant\nsays he was prepared to impeach Mr. Wehinger on his preliminary hearing testimony,\nbecause defendant was in the Bahamas during Christmas of 1987, but “by the time the\ndefense became aware Wehinger was claiming Villelli had discussed hit men with\n[defendant], Villelli was very near death and unable to testify to rebut this claim.”\n       Again, this is hypothetical testimony; we do not know whether Mr. Villelli would\nhave rebutted or substantiated Mr. Wehinger’s testimony. If we assume Mr. Villelli\nwould have contradicted Mr. Wehinger, the loss of this testimony would prejudice\ndefendant. But, after Mr. Wehinger’s uncertainty at the preliminary hearing as to when\nthe conversation occurred, defendant certainly could not count on impeaching\nMr. Wehinger at trial with his Bahamas alibi for Christmas of 1987. So after the\npreliminary hearing in 2004, defendant had every incentive to interview Mr. Villelli, both\nabout the date and the nature of the conversation, and apparently failed to do so. Given\nthe speculative nature of Mr. Villelli’s lost testimony, and the other extensive evidence of\ndefendant’s threats (such as Gregory Keay’s testimony that defendant said “he would\nhave [Mr. Thompson] wasted”), defendant was not unduly prejudiced by Mr. Villelli’s\nunavailability.\n\n\n\n\n                                             69\n\f                     E. Gregory Keay’s mother (defendant’s aunt)\n       As just noted, Gregory Keay testified to a threat defendant made at a family\ngathering two or three months before the murders, to have Mickey Thompson “wasted.”\nDorothy Keay “could have testified to the date the gathering occurred, her son’s lack of\ncredibility and his bias against [defendant].” Again, this is nothing more than\nspeculation, not an affirmative showing of prejudice\n                     F. Charles Clayton\n       Mr. Clayton was defendant’s friend and financial advisor and, defendant says,\n“would have testified [defendant] always intended to pay the Thompson judgment . . . .”\nMr. Clayton also structured the yacht purchase and could have testified to the\ncircumstances surrounding the purchase and the couple’s plans to live on the\nJGA/Whitehawk distributions.\n       Defendant does not tell us when Mr. Clayton died or why the information he had\nabout the yacht purchase would not be available from other sources. Moreover, his\ntestimony about defendant’s intent to pay off the Thompson judgment based on any\nfinancial planning the two may have done together would be inconsequential, in light of\nthe evidence from Dolores Cordell that defendant did indeed repeatedly express his\nwillingness to accept settlement terms, only to renege at the last minute. Accordingly,\nany prejudice defendant suffered from the unavailability of Mr. Clayton’s testimony was\nminimal.\n                     G. Anne Clark\n       Ms. Clark was a close friend of the Thompsons. After the murders, on\nFebruary 15, 1989, she called into a television show that solicited tips about the murder.\nThe “clue sheet” stated she “want[ed] to know why they didn’t mention the drug deal.\nMickey’s sister [Collene] knew about a drug deal. [Mickey Thompson] had asked\n[Ms. Clark] to give him one million dollars. She does not know what for. Sheriff took\nover call.” (The clue sheet also says, “cleared” and “no new info.”) Detective Lillienfeld\ninterviewed Ms. Clark in May 2002, and the report of the interview did not mention the\n\n\n\n                                            70\n\fcall to the tip line. When defendant sought to interview Ms. Clark, “her dementia was so\nadvanced she no longer recognized anyone.”\n       We fail to see any basis to conclude Ms. Clark had any information helpful to the\ndefense; no prejudice was shown.\n                     H. Frank Gullett\n       According to defendant, Joey Hunter confessed his involvement in the murders to\nFrank Gullet, while they were both in jail after Mr. Hunter’s arrest in late April 1988,\nwhen Mr. Hunter was a suspect in the murders. (Defendant does not cite to it, but we\nfound in the record a search warrant affidavit that recounts a police interview with Frank\nGullet, in which Mr. Gullet said that he asked Mr. Hunter if he was actually involved in\nthe murders and Mr. Hunter stated, “ ‘Yes, but they can’t prove it . . . .’ ”) If he had been\nalive at the time of trial, defendant says, Mr. Gullet “could have provided valuable\ntestimony about Hunter’s confession that would have supported [defendant’s] attempt to\npresent third party culpability evidence to the jury and impeached the investigation.”\n       Defendant does not say what this “valuable testimony about Hunter’s confession”\nwas, or how it would support his attempt to present third party culpability evidence. (The\ntrial court properly excluded defendant’s third party culpability evidence (as we discuss\nin pt. 9, post), and indicated that “there is no evidence that Joey Hunter has any\nconnection with this case.”) Defendant has not shown prejudice from the loss of\nMr. Gullet’s testimony.\n              xi. Memory loss of trial witnesses\n       Defendant cites the trial testimony of 12 witnesses who he contends “suffered\nmemory distortion and loss prejudicial to defendant,” forgetting details, including\nspecific words defendant spoke and dates threats were allegedly made. These were as\nfollows:\n       Dale Newman could not recall the exact words of the threat he overheard, and a\npolice report was used to refresh his recollection. (Defendant tried to impeach his\ntestimony that the threat occurred in the fall of 1987 by showing him a police report\nstating he said it happened in July 1986, but Mr. Newman insisted that he “certainly did\n\n                                             71\n\fnot” say that, and “[t]hat would have to be a typo on [the detective’s] part or whatever,”\nand “[r]egardless it was not correct.”)\n       Bill Wilson could not remember to whom he spoke when he first called the police\nwith information about the murders, and could not remember when defendant and\nMr. Thompson became business partners. Nina Wilson could not remember the precise\ndate of the dinner party at which defendant threatened Mickey Thompson, or why they\nhad invited the Goodwins, or whether Detective Lillienfeld was the first detective she\nspoke to about the case.\n       Karen Dragutin could not remember which detective she spoke to in 1989, or\ndetails concerning television broadcasts about the murder and rewards offered, or the date\nor other details of the dinner at which she heard defendant threaten Mickey Thompson.\n       Baron Wehinger and Gregory Keay could not recall the dates of the threats they\nheard, so defendant could not investigate or impeach them and could not establish his\nwhereabouts or find witnesses to testify the conversations never occurred.\n       Dolores Cordell, Jeffrey Coyne, and Karen Stephens-Kingdon all said “I don’t\nrecall” to various questions, the materiality of which defendant does not explain; he\nmerely claims their failure to recall “would not have withstood scrutiny had the case been\nbrought in 1989 or 1990.” (Defendant’s assertion that the prosecutors presented expert\nopinion on his financial wrongdoing “without regard to the facts” and “knew the original\ndocuments supplying the basis for these opinions were lost or destroyed years ago” is\nentirely unsupported by the record.)\n       Penn Weldon could not remember precisely when his conversation with defendant\noccurred, and he no longer had his appointment book.\n       Defendant also asserts that the passage of time and outside influences “no doubt”\naffected Allison Triarsi’s memory of the incident, and that Detective Griggs could not\nrecall the details of interviews that would have contradicted prosecution witnesses,\n“including [Detectives] Verdugo and Jansen,” and was unable to authenticate his notes.\nAs to Detective Griggs, defendant provides no information about or citations to the\nrecord explaining these asserted contradictions, and merely complains that Detective\n\n                                            72\n\fGriggs did not recall entering the Thompson home to determine whether personal\nproperty was missing, and that Detective Verdugo was permitted to testify no property\nwas missing despite the absence of his original notes on that issue.\n       Many of the memory lapses just described were inconsequential. All of them are\nspeculative, in the sense that we are asked to assume that had memories been sharper, the\ntestimony would have been more favorable – rather than more damning – to defendant.\nThis falls far short of the affirmative showing of prejudice necessary to avoid murder\ncharges. (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1250.)\n       In sum, for the reasons we have given, we cannot characterize the loss of\nwitnesses, and the loss of evidence due to fading memory, in this case as more than\nminimally prejudicial to the defense. Almost all of the lost evidence or testimony\ndefendant cites demonstrates only the potential for prejudice, rather than actual prejudice,\nand the trial court correctly concluded that it would be improper simply to assume the\ncited evidence would have been favorable to defendant.\n       d. The justification for the delay\n       The prosecutor’s justification for the delay, certainly in the abstract, is strong. The\nstate did not amass the necessary evidence for a successful prosecution until 2001, when\nthe police learned that Ronald and Tonyia Stevens had seen defendant in the\nneighborhood with binoculars a few days before the murders. In the end, the question\nwhether the 13-year delay in prosecution violated defendant’s due process rights turns on\nwhether there was malfeasance or negligence in the state’s failure to obtain that evidence\nsooner. As Cowan tells us, a weak showing of prejudice would tip the scales toward a\ndue process violation if the delay was purposeful, but “[i]f the delay was merely\nnegligent,” a greater showing of prejudice would be required to establish a violation.\n(Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 431.)\n       Here, the trial court concluded that it could not “fault anyone for the fact that it\ntook so long to actually get enough evidence to file the case.” Defendant contends\notherwise, saying that the prosecution had “constructive knowledge” of the Stevenses’\n\n\n\n                                              73\n\finformation in 1988. This is because the Stevenses called the police several times, telling\nthem they had possible information about the murders. Specifically:\n       On the day the Stevenses saw the car parked outside their home, Tonyia Stevens\ncalled the Temple City Sheriff’s Department and reported a suspicious looking car,\ntelling the police “ ‘I just want you to know in case anything happens that we have\ninformation.’ ” A couple of weeks after the murders, a uniformed policeman at a\nroadblock stopped Tonyia Stevens and asked her if she had any information. She\ntestified: “And I said, ‘yes, I do’ and I told him. He says, ‘Have you told the police?’\nand I said, ‘Yes.’ He says ‘Okay, go on then.’ ” Ronald Stevens said he tried to report\nthe incident to the police, “either three or four times, not long after the murder.” After\ntalking to a friend, he called the Duarte Sheriff’s Department, at about 9:00 p.m., and told\nthe person who answered the phone that he thought he had some information on the\nThompson murder. Mr. Stevens was told a detective would call him, but no one did. A\ncouple of weeks later, Mr. Stevens called the Temple City Sheriff’s Department “and left\nanother message. Same thing.” In addition, Mr. Stevens said: “I think there was one or\ntwo other times that I called because I just, you know, tried to call someone. But I don’t\nremember the dates or times.”\n       Despite these efforts by the Stevenses in 1988 to report their information, no\ninvestigator contacted Mr. Stevens about the incident until 2001. Defendant contends the\ninformation was not “new” in 2001; “investigators had it in 1988 and ignored it”; and the\ninformation “is imputed to the prosecution,” citing Kyles, supra, 514 U.S. at page 438.\nKyles is inapposite. There, the court was discussing exculpatory evidence withheld by\nthe government, and stated the well-established proposition that, under Brady, “the\nindividual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others\nacting on the government’s behalf in the case, including the police.” (Kyles, at p. 437.)\nHere, we do not have a Brady question of disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Moreover,\nthe police did not in fact obtain the Stevenses’ information until 2001, so it can hardly be\n“imputed to the prosecution” as of 1988.\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\f       We do not know how or why the Stevenses messages to the police went astray, but\nthey did. This is certainly not “malfeasance.” It was an error, but we cannot necessarily\ncharacterize it as negligence. This was not a situation where the investigators received\ninformation that the Stevenses saw defendant at the scene, or had the license plate\nnumber of a suspicious vehicle, and then failed to follow up. Instead, unidentified police\npersonnel apparently did not pass on telephone messages about information possibly\nrelating to the murders. In a more perfect world, the investigators would have had the\ninformation sooner, but in fact they did not. So in the absence of a showing of prejudice\nconsiderably more significant than we have seen, the justification for the delay in\nprosecution – that the police did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute defendant until\n2001 – plainly outweighs the prejudice. (See Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 436 [finding\nno evidence of negligence; “[r]ather, at worst the . . . Sheriff’s Department simply erred\nwhen it failed to determine before 1994 that defendant’s fingerprints matched the [crime]\nscene latent prints”].)\n       Defendant’s other attacks on the investigation fare no better. He asserts that\n“discovery and testimony at trial indicate investigators did nothing during the periods\n1990 through 1992, 1992 through 1995, and 1996 through 1997.” But he cites nothing in\nthe record to support this assertion, other than defense counsel’s own argument to the\ntrial court. And Detective Lillienfeld testified that Sergeant Yarborough of the cold case\nunit had the lead on the investigation after Detective Griggs retired. (See Cowan, supra,\n50 Cal.4th at pp. 428, 436 [no active investigation from 1987 to 1994; court rejected\ndefendant’s claim the investigation was dormant during that period, as there was\ntestimony that the supervisor of the unit was responsible for the case after the assigned\ndetective left in 1987; “we will not second-guess the department’s decision to allocate its\nresources in this manner”].)\n       Defendant also claims – citing only counsel’s affidavit “on information and belief”\nseeking discovery of Detective Griggs’s personnel file – that Detective Griggs did not\nfocus on leads he should have followed. But counsel’s declaration is not evidence of\nmalfeasance or negligence. Nor is defendant’s assertion that in 1988, four detectives\n\n                                            75\n\fwere re-assigned to other matters due to staffing requirements. (See Nelson, supra, 43\nCal.4th at p. 1256 [“[a] court may not find negligence by second-guessing how the state\nallocates its resources”].)18\n       Finally, defendant also argues that Gail Moreau-Hunter’s information – that\ndefendant had in effect confessed his responsibility for the murders – was not “new” in\n1999, when Detective Lillienfeld located and interviewed her; that Ms. Moreau-Hunter\n“confirmed an interview” in January 1993 (the nature of which is not specified in\ndefendant’s brief or in the record); and that in any event Ms. Moreau-Hunter was\n“delusional.” We need not linger long on these points, since Ms. Moreau-Hunter did not\ntestify at trial, and it was the Stevenses’ evidence that enabled the prosecutors to file the\ncase. In any event, there is no evidence of police negligence in respect of Ms. Moreau-\nHunter’s testimony and, in the absence of any evidence of negligence or malfeasance, we\nwill not second-guess the conduct of the investigation (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\np. 1256) based on speculation that somehow the police could have elicited the\ninformation from Ms. Moreau-Hunter earlier. The fact is, as the Court of Appeal in\nOrange County pointed out, these were new developments in the case.\n\n\n\n\n18     Defendant also characterizes Detective Lillienfeld’s investigation as “grossly\nnegligent.” The investigative files he reviewed from 1988 contained an Arizona license\nplate number for a car which, defense counsel told the trial court, was parked in the\ndriveway of a drug dealer (seven miles from the Thompson home) associated with Joey\nHunter (who was then being investigated in connection with the murders). Defendant\ncomplains that, after the Stevenses told him the car in front of their house had an Arizona\nlicense plate, Detective Lillienfeld did not try to determine the make and model of the car\nthat had been parked in the drug dealer’s driveway. We fail to see the significance of this\nclaim, as Joey Hunter had long since been abandoned as a suspect. To the extent\ndefendant’s claim is that Joey Hunter should have continued to be a suspect, there is no\nbasis to suggest that is so. (See Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1256 [“A court may not\nfind negligence by second-guessing . . . how law enforcement agencies could have\ninvestigated a given case.”].) And Detective Lillienfeld did attempt to trace the vehicle\nparked outside the Stevenses home, but could not find a vehicle that matched the best\ndescription he had (a 1973 Chevrolet Malibu nine-passenger station wagon).\n\n\n                                              76\n\f       e. Summary\n       While most of defendant’s claimed losses of evidence are speculative, we cannot\ndefinitively say that the passage of time resulted in no prejudice to defendant. But “[t]o\navoid murder charges due to delay, the defendant must affirmatively show prejudice.”\n(Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1250.) Defendant’s affirmative showing of prejudice was\nminimal. And we can definitively say – despite defendant’s claims the delay in\nprosecution was “intentional” and “the real purpose . . . was to weaken [defendant’s]\nability to defend himself” – that there is not the slightest evidence of a deliberate delay to\ngain a tactical advantage. (See id. at p. 1256 [“ ‘Investigative delay is fundamentally\nunlike delay undertaken by the government solely to gain tactical advantage over an\naccused because investigative delay is not so one-sided. A prosecutor abides by\nelementary standards of fair play and decency by refusing to seek indictments until he or\nshe is completely satisfied the defendant should be prosecuted and the office of the\nprosecutor will be able to promptly establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’ ”].)\n       There is no doubt that 13 years is a long prearrest delay, but it was not a\npurposeful one. The bottom line is that the prosecutors concluded they did not have\nenough evidence to convict defendant until 2001. This is a strong justification for the\nprearrest delay. Errors in an investigation do not always amount to negligence, and they\ndid not here. “It is not enough for a defendant to argue that if the prosecutorial agencies\nhad made his or her case a higher priority or had done things a bit differently they would\nhave solved the case sooner.” (Nelson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1256-1257.)\n       The court’s summary in Cowan is apt in this case: “[T]he investigation of the . . .\nmurders was not perfect; no investigation is. Like the trial court, however, we find no\nevidence that law enforcement or the prosecution deliberately delayed the investigation in\norder to gain a tactical advantage over defendant. Nor do we find evidence of\nnegligence. Rather, at worst the . . . Sheriff’s Department simply erred . . . . That being\nthe case, balancing defendant’s weak showing of prejudice against the strong justification\nfor the delay [citation], we find no due process violation. Accordingly, the trial court did\n\n\n\n                                              77\n\fnot abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s . . . motion[] to dismiss due to\nprearrest delay.” (Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 436.)\n4. The Pitchess/Brady issue\n       Before the trial, defendant filed several motions seeking information from\nDetective Griggs’s personnel file, under Pitchess, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1246483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1246483/pitchess-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and Brady, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       Under Pitchess procedures, on a showing of good cause, a criminal defendant is\nentitled to material information contained in confidential personnel records of a police\nofficer. If good cause is shown, the trial court must review the requested records in\ncamera to determine what information, if any, should be disclosed. (People v. Mooc\n(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621789\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621789/people-v-mooc/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1226 (Mooc).) Under Brady, the prosecution is required to\ndisclose favorable evidence to the defense.\n       Here, the defense sought material from Detective Griggs’s personnel files,\nparticularly information relating to his disability retirement, psychiatric evaluations and\nthe like, as well as any other exculpatory or impeaching material within the meaning of\nBrady. The defense theory was that Detective Griggs was incapable of conducting a fair,\ncompetent and unbiased investigation; that his deficient investigation ignored other viable\nleads and suspects, particularly Joey Hunter; that there were complaints from Collene\nCampbell about his job performance; that all this led to a stress-related early retirement,\nand the disability he claimed substantially affected his judgment and credibility. The\ndefense sought personnel files from both the sheriff’s department and LACERA for the\nretired detective.\n       We need not describe the multiple motions and arguments on the Pitchess and\nBrady theories relating to discovery of Detective Griggs’s personnel file. In the end, on\nMay 23, 2006, the trial court ordered the sheriff’s department and LACERA to produce\nany documents in the personnel files referring to the Mickey Thompson investigation for\nin camera review. Counsel for LACERA had brought LACERA’s records, and left them\nwith the court for in camera review, with a hearing scheduled for June 7, 2006.\n\n\n\n                                              78\n\f(LACERA had destroyed all its files except for those relied on in granting Detective\nGriggs’s disability retirement.)\n       On June 7, 2006, the court announced it had reviewed the entire file from\nLACERA, “and paper clipped and put post-its on the portions that I feel should be\ndisclosed.” That package was identified as “Court’s Exhibit 1, LACERA\nPitchess/Brady,” and preserved for appellate review.\n       Also on June 7, 2006, the court briefly reviewed the personnel file materials\nprovided by the sheriff’s department, and observed it appeared there was nothing to be\ndisclosed. But, to be certain, the court directed the custodian and her counsel to cull the\nfile to eliminate material pertaining to the period before the murders, and to return with\nthe remaining material for the court’s in camera review. On June 16, 2006, the sheriff’s\ndepartment brought the personnel records for the period March 16, 1988, to March 23,\n1993, and the court ordered certain of the documents disclosed to the defense, staying its\norder until June 29, 2006, to permit the sheriff’s department to decide whether to seek\nwrit review. Apparently no writ was sought.\n       The parties agree that this court should independently review the sealed transcripts\nof the hearings and related sealed personnel files, to ascertain whether the trial court\nproperly exercised its discretion in identifying discoverable information. We have\nreviewed the sealed transcript of the in camera hearing at which the trial court described,\non the record, the items in Detective Griggs’s personnel file produced by the sheriff’s\ndepartment, and find no abuse of discretion.

We have\nlikewise reviewed the in camera transcript and the confidential documents produced by\nLACERA and preserved for appellate review, and again find no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              79\n\f5. Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s Expert Testimony\n       We have described Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony in part 7.a., ante, of the\nfacts. In a nutshell, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon looked at thousands of financial records to\ndetermine the source and ultimate disposition of certain assets and funds, and opined, for\nexample, that the yacht Diane Goodwin purchased in her own name was bought with\nfunds that had been commingled for years, and that “funds that were originally\ncommingled and invested end[ed] up going offshore or to purchase gold coins, cash or\ntraveler’s checks.”\n       On appeal, defendant contends Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony was\ninadmissible, principally because the testimony could not assist the jury in its fact finding\nand on relevance grounds. Defendant made the same arguments, unsuccessfully, at the\npreliminary hearing and when he moved under Penal Code section 995 to set aside the\ninformation after the preliminary hearing.19 None of them has merit.\n       An expert may offer an opinion on “a subject that is sufficiently beyond common\nexperience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.” (Evid. Code,\n§ 801, subd. (a); People v. Mayfield (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1191713\"><a href=\"/opinion/1191713/people-v-mayfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766.) An expert is qualified\nif he or she “ ‘has sufficient skill or experience in the field so that his [or her] testimony\n\n\n19     Respondent contends defendant did not object at trial to the expert’s testimony on\nthe ground she was not qualified as an expert, and therefore forfeited those objections on\nappeal. It is true that, in his brief reciting his objections at trial, defendant implies he\nobjected that Ms. Stephens-Kingdon “was not a qualified expert on the financial issues,”\nand defendant does not identify any such objection in the record. But his argument on\nappeal does not address Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s qualifications as an expert on financial\nissues; it is directed to the content or nature of her testimony. To the extent respondent is\ncontending that points raised in defendant’s unsuccessful motion to set aside the\ninformation must be explicitly raised again at trial but were not, the record is not so clear.\n(Defense counsel told the trial court, “I don’t think that necessarily means it required an\nexpert,” and “if they could prove it, then the jury could make up its own mind about what\nthose assets transfers mean.”) And the case on which respondent relies, People v.\nHawkins (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203-204, is not directly on point, holding only that\nan issue not raised in a Penal Code section 995 dismissal motion was not preserved for\nappeal. We will therefore address defendant’s claims on their merits.\n\n\n                                              80\n\fwould be likely to assist the jury in the search for the truth.’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nMayfield, at p. 766.) We review a trial court’s ruling permitting expert testimony for\nabuse of discretion. (Ibid.)\n        Defendant asserts the expert testimony was inadmissible because it “could not\nassist the jury in understanding the evidence and brought incompetent hearsay before the\njury.” According to defendant, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon “overstepped her ‘expert’ status,”\nbecause the Evidence Code does not “authorize[] a witness to review documents not\nbrought before the court and give an opinion regarding the defendant’s purpose for his or\nhis family member’s financial dealings,” or “to testify to the state of mind and intent of a\ndefendant based on his wife’s financial dealings.” The expert “did not assist the jury in\nits fact-finding,” because “she was in no better position than they were to evaluate the\nevidence concerning [defendant’s] ‘consciousness of guilt.’ ”\n        As we have seen, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon examined thousands of financial records\nand testified to the source and disposition of certain assets and funds. She did not testify\nto the defendant’s purpose or state of mind or intent as to those transactions. She opined\nthat assets originally purchased with commingled funds of both spouses were transferred\nto investments or purchases in the name of one spouse. This subject matter is sufficiently\nbeyond common experience that the opinion of a qualified accountant and auditor would\nassist the trier of fact.\n        Defendant insists the expert testified to defendant’s “state of mind and intent”\nbased on his wife’s financial dealings. To support his claim, defendant cites only the\nexpert’s testimony about the purchase of the yacht with commingled funds and contends\nthat this testimony “draw[s] conclusions regarding motive.” When asked if, as she had\ntestified, funds were commingled as of January 1988, “what does that tell you, if\nanything, about [defendant’s] interest in the boat transaction,” the witness replied, “What\nI saw was that even though this boat was in Diane Goodwin’s name, that it had been\npurchased with funds that had been commingled for so many years that this boat purchase\nwas for both Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin.” We reject the notion that the quoted testimony\nwas tantamount to an opinion on defendant’s motive, purpose, state of mind or intent. It\n\n                                             81\n\fwas simply a statement, consistent with the rest of the expert’s testimony, on the source\nand disposition of assets – not on why the transaction was undertaken.20\n       Defendant also argues the expert testimony “brought incompetent hearsay before\nthe jury,” and the expert “did not bring to court any of the documents she reviewed . . . or\nabout which she testified.” Because defendant does not elaborate on these claims, we\nneed not consider them. We do note, however, that the prosecutor questioned the witness\nwith specific reference to a limited number of documents (as defendant admits) that were\nidentified in court. And when the expert expressed opinions in reliance on specific\ndocuments, the trial court instructed the jury, during the testimony, that the “information\nreferred to now by the witness is being offered not for the truth of what it says but just to\nshow what the witness based her opinion on,” and “she’s explaining what her opinion is\nbased on, but you are not to assume that the letters state what she says they state for the\ntruth of the matter.” Further, it is well established that an expert may base an opinion on\nreliable hearsay. (People v. Harris (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 [“Expert testimony in the\nform of an opinion may be based on hearsay or facts outside the personal knowledge of\nthe expert.”]; see Evid.

Section 1523, subdivision (a)\n\n20      Defendant asserts, erroneously, that Kotla v. Regents of the University of\nCalifornia (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2281428\"><a href=\"/opinion/2281428/kotla-v-regents-of-university-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is analogous to this case. In that employment\ntermination case, the trial court erred in permitting a management expert to offer opinion\ntestimony about whether certain facts were “indicators” of a retaliatory motive. (Id. at p.\n286.) The appellate court found the opinions “about the significance of the evidence did\nnot assist the jury in its factfinding process,” and that the expert “was in no better\nposition than they were to evaluate the evidence concerning retaliation. Absent unusual\nfacts, it must be presumed that jurors are capable of deciding a party’s motive for\nthemselves without being told by an expert which finding on that issue the evidence\nsupports.” (Id. at p. 293.) As we have observed, Ms. Stephens-Kingdon did not testify\nabout the motive for the financial transactions on which she opined.\n\n                                             82\n\fmakes oral testimony “to prove the content of a writing” inadmissible except as otherwise\nprovided by statute. Section 1523, subdivision (d) provides an exception “if the writing\nconsists of numerous accounts or other writings that cannot be examined in court without\ngreat loss of time, and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of the\nwhole.” Defendant cites no authority for his claim, and it has no merit. Section 1523 has\nnothing to do with expert testimony, and Ms. Stephens-Kingdon did not purport to testify\n“to prove the content of a writing.” She testified about the documents she relied on in\nforming her opinions, and there was nothing improper in that testimony.\n       Finally, defendant contends Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony was irrelevant,\nbecause “Diane[] [Goodwin’s] financial transactions did not show a consciousness of\nguilt on [defendant’s] part.” Defendant fails to identify in the record any objection made\nat trial on grounds of relevance. (Defendant did object on this ground to Ms. Stephens-\nKingdon’s testimony at the preliminary hearing. The prosecutor explained that the\ntestimony was relevant to the theory of “consciousness of guilt in the defendant\nattempting to flee the country,” and the court found that “potentially the People have a\nrelevant theory here.”) In any event, the testimony was relevant. As the prosecutor put it\nat trial, the ultimate opinion he sought to elicit was “what [defendant] and Diane\nGoodwin were doing financially from the period of 1986 to the spring of 1988.” And as\nthe trial court stated, the prosecutor sought to show defendant “was engaged in . . .\ntransferring of assets to avoid, I think the argument is, to avoid having to pay a\nsubstantial judgment, and this witness is competent to testify to whether or not she\nbelieves based on her review of these documents, whether or not that is what occurred.”\nThe claim of irrelevance is meritless.\n       Because there was no error in the admission of Ms. Stephens-Kingdon’s\ntestimony, we need not consider defendant’s further contention that the error was\nprejudicial.\n6. The Admission of Nancy Lucia’s Testimony\n       Nancy Lucia (formerly Wilkinson) was permitted to testify to a statement Mickey\nThompson made in September or October 1987 while Ms. Lucia was visiting the\n\n                                             83\n\fThompson home (pt. 2.l. of the recitation of facts, ante). Mr. Thompson came upstairs,\nout of breath and frantic, “almost kind of yelling, saying ‘[c]lose the window. Close the\ndrapes. [Defendant] could have a sniper out there right now.”\n       We review the trial court’s ruling for abuse of discretion (People v. Guerra (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633286\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633286/people-v-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1140 [“we apply an abuse of discretion standard of review to any ruling\nby a trial court on the admissibility of evidence”]), and find none.\n       a. The trial court’s ruling\n       The trial court concluded Mr. Thompson’s statement was not hearsay, because it\nwas not being offered for its truth, and it was relevant “on the issue of the level of\nhostility that existed in this litigation. [¶] It’s circumstantial evidence which would tend\nto corroborate the People’s argument and the People’s witnesses that this litigation was\nso vitriolic; this litigation was so intense and caused such animosity and hatred between\nthe parties, that Mr. Thompson truly believed that because of the litigation he was\ninvolved in with [defendant], that his life was in danger. That’s a non-hearsay purpose in\nmy mind.”21\n       The court elaborated: “[I]t is circumstantial evidence tending to corroborate the\nPeople’s description of what they believe the motive was in this case. It’s circumstantial\nevidence that the litigation got so out of hand and was so intense that there was a realistic\nbelief on the part of Mr. Thompson that his life was in danger. [¶] Now, the reason I say\nthat it’s circumstantial evidence to show all of that is because it’s not so important as to\n\n21      The court said that, if the statement were being offered for its truth, “it would\nclearly be hearsay. And then the court would have to find it is [an Evidence Code\nsection 1240 spontaneous] statement and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial\neffect, all of which I can easily find. [¶] However, it’s not being offered for the truth.”\nThen, after elaborating on the admissibility of the statement as circumstantial evidence\n“tending to show that because of the animosity generated and the vitriolic nature of this\nlawsuit that [defendant] had a motive to murder these two people,” the court said: “So\nmy analysis is, assuming it’s hearsay, it comes in under [section] 1240. Its probative\nvalue outweighs any prejudicial effect. However, I think the proper analysis would be\nthat this is a non-hearsay statement not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. And\nthe People can’t argue that it’s offered for the truth of the matter asserted.”\n\n\n                                              84\n\fwhat was said, if anything, by [defendant]. And I don’t think Mr. Thompson attributes\nthe statement to [defendant], but he is attributing a belief. And that belief has to be based\non some fact or facts. [¶] And it appears to me that given the testimony I have heard so\nfar, it’s not unreasonable to conclude that Mr. Thompson, as a party to this litigation, was\naware of and a participant in the goings-on between the sides. Therefore, he was aware\nof the fact that . . . the hatred generated by the litigation was rather intense. This\nstatement was allegedly made [in] early fall, late summer 1987. So it’s not that long\nbefore the murders. [¶] So for those reasons, I view it as a non-hearsay statement\ncoming in for the value that it brings or demonstrates in terms of the level of hostility\nbelieved to have existed by Mr. Thompson; not being offered for the truth.”\n       The court further ruled that the probative value of the testimony far outweighed its\nprejudicial effect: “It’s extremely probative. And the prejudicial effect, quite frankly, we\nhave heard nothing but statements from the People’s witnesses attributed to [defendant]\nthat he allegedly wants to kill Mr. Thompson. [¶] So the extent to which this is too\nprejudicial is nonexistent. It’s simply the same kind of evidence that we have heard from\njust about every witness that has testified so far. So I do believe under [Evidence Code\nsection] 352 the probative value is considerable. The prejudicial effect [is] minimal to\nnonexistent when taken in context with the other evidence. So I will allow it.”\n       Defense counsel asked about a limiting instruction, and the court replied, “I was\ngoing to simply tell the jury what I’m supposed to tell them, which is this statement is not\nbeing admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, that is that [defendant] has some sniper\nstanding outside the house. But it’s being admitted as circumstantial evidence tending to\nshow how the victim perceived the tenor of this lawsuit or this litigation.” There was no\nfurther discussion until after Ms. Lucia testified two days later.\n       The court did not admonish the jury when Ms. Lucia testified, and later in the day\ninquired whether counsel wanted the court “to admonish them now or would you just\nsimply like to include the admonition in a jury instruction?” After argument about the\ncontent of the admonition, defense counsel ultimately said: “Our request is that the\nadmonition be that it’s offered not for the truth of the statement, but for the state of mind\n\n                                              85\n\fof the declarant. Period. And if that’s not the admonition, then we are not requesting\none.” After more discussion, the court pointed out it would not admonish “that the\nPeople were offering it solely on the issue of the state of mind, because that would have\nbeen for the truth,” and reiterated that it had ruled that the statement was “circumstantial\nevidence corroborating the level of animosity that existed between the parties in this\nlitigation.” The defense then stated, “we’re not requesting the admonition,” and the court\nstated: “All right. I’m not going to say anything then. And I stand ready, willing and\nable to do so when requested.”\n       b. Defendant’s contentions\n       Defendant contends the court committed reversible error by admitting the\ntestimony, claiming it was “irrelevant and prejudicial hearsay.” We disagree.\n       Defendant argues at length that the trial court “erred by admitting evidence of\nThompson’s state of mind, offered under Evidence Code [section] 1250, because the\nevidence was irrelevant to [defendant’s] motive.”22 This claim simply misstates the trial\ncourt’s ruling, as well as the prosecutor’s theory of admissibility. The evidence was not\noffered to prove Mr. Thompson’s state of mind; the prosecutor explicitly said that\n“[w]e’re not offering it under [section] 1250. We are offering it to prove another factor,\nwhich is that this litigation was not one of conciliatory settlement.” And the trial court\nrefused defense counsel’s request to admonish the jury that the statement was being\noffered “on the issue of state of mind, because that would have been for the truth.” Thus\ndefendant’s extended discussion of whether and when a victim’s out-of-court statements\nexpressing fear of a defendant are admissible, under section 1250, to prove the\ndefendant’s motive is entirely inapposite.\n\n\n\n22      Evidence Code section 1250 provides that “evidence of a statement of the\ndeclarant’s then existing state of mind . . . is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule\nwhen: [¶] (1) The evidence is offered to prove the declarant’s state of mind . . . at that\ntime or at any other time when it is itself an issue in the action; or [¶] (2) The evidence\nis offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of the declarant.” (Id., subd. (a).)\n\n\n                                             86\n\f       Defendant points out that a hearsay objection to an out-of-court statement “may\nnot be overruled simply by identifying a nonhearsay purpose for admitting the statement.\nThe trial court must also find that the nonhearsay purpose is relevant to an issue in\ndispute.” (People v. Armendariz (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1173075\"><a href=\"/opinion/1173075/people-v-armendariz/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585.) The trial court did exactly\nthat here.\n       When defense counsel suggested the defense was not arguing “that this litigation\nwas anything less than hostile nor do we intend to,” the trial court “[took] issue with the\nstatement that you are not disputing the level of hostility.” The trial court pointed out\nthat the cross-examination of Dolores Cordell the previous day sought to show a\nsettlement was in the offing, and “if the argument is that it’s the lawsuit that caused\n[defendant] to form the intent to have the Thompsons or Mr. Thompson taken out,\ncertainly that intent would be somewhat vitiated were one to assume that they were on\nthe verge of a settlement just prior to the murders. Otherwise it would have no\nrelevance.”23 And in an earlier discussion on the admissibility of the statement, the court\nobserved that “the fact that the victim appreciated the level of hatred and contempt\ncommunicated by [defendant] to others” was “pretty potent evidence” that “tends to show\nthat it existed,” contradicting the defense position that defendant’s statements to others\nwere merely “blowing off steam.” Similarly, the statement tends to corroborate Joel\n\n23     In his reply brief, defendant disavows reliance on the argument that\nMr. Thompson’s statement did not qualify under Evidence Code section 1250’s state-of-\nmind exception to the hearsay rule, contending his argument is that Ms. Lucia’s\ntestimony “was simply irrelevant.” He then cites People v. Jablonski (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594806\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594806/people-v-jablonski/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> for the rule that a victim’s out-of-court statements expressing fear of a defendant are\nrelevant only when the victim’s conduct in conformity with that fear is in dispute. But\nJablonski was construing section 1250: “ ‘As our cases have made clear, “a victim’s out-\nof-court statements of fear of an accused are admissible under section 1250 only when\nthe victim’s conduct in conformity with that fear is in dispute. Absent such dispute, the\nstatements are irrelevant. [Citations.]” ’ [Citation.]” (Jablonski, at p. 819.) The\nprosecutor was clear: “[W]e could probably have 15 witnesses walk into the court . . .\nand say Mickey Thompson wasn’t afraid of anything. [¶] We’re not proposing this\nevidence to prove fear. We’re proposing this evidence to prove the level of animosity;\nthe level of vitriol in the litigation in general.”\n\n\n                                             87\n\fWeissler’s testimony later in the trial that he heard defendant say, in late 1987 or early\n1988, that he was “going to hurt [Mr. Thompson] and [his] family.”\n       In short, Mr. Thompson’s statement was not offered for its truth. It was offered\nfor the relevant, nonhearsay purpose of showing Mr. Thompson believed the litigation\nwith defendant was so vitriolic that he might carry out his threats to kill both Thompsons,\nwhich is circumstantial evidence of defendant’s motive. And there was no abuse of\ndiscretion in the trial court’s conclusion that the evidence was more probative than\nprejudicial. The record fully supports the trial court’s observation that the prejudicial\neffect was “minimal to nonexistent,” as it was “the same kind of evidence that we have\nheard from just about every witness that has testified so far.”24\n       For the same reasons – the presentation of similar evidence from many other\nwitnesses – any error in admission of Ms. Lucia’s testimony would have been harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. While defendant describes the admission of the testimony as\n“extraordinarily damaging,” particularly because of the reference to a sniper and because\nof the prosecution’s “hit man” theory, several other witnesses testified to defendant’s\nstatements about having Mr. Thompson killed. In addition, there was no argument to the\njury referring to the statement about a sniper. So, even if there were error in admitting\nMs. Lucia’s testimony – and we hold there was not – it was harmless.25\n\n24      Defendant also argues the statement did not fall within the spontaneous utterance\nexception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, § 1240.) While the trial court briefly referred\nto that theory of admissibility, it was not the basis for the trial court’s ultimate ruling (see\nfn. 21, ante), so we need not consider the point.\n\n25      Defendant points to the jury foreman’s declaration that the jury “discussed that\nthis statement was important in that it showed Thompson was in fear and that [defendant]\nwas the source of that fear,” and that Ms. Lucia “was one of fifteen witnesses who\ntestified about threats,” and “one of several witnesses regarding the threats that we\ndeemed credible.” As we observed earlier, statements such as these “concern[] the\nmental processes by which [the verdict] was determined” and cannot be used to impeach\nthe verdict.

He also claims the testimony was inadmissible under\nsection 352, because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the probability\nthat its admission would “create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the\nissues, or of misleading the jury.” (§ 352.) The admission of this evidence, defendant\ncontends, violated his due process right to a fair trial “because it allowed the jury to find\nhim guilty of two murders because of the person he was, rather than what he actually\ndid.”\n        We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s rulings. In each case, the\nevidence consisted of statements by defendant that the trial court correctly viewed as\n\n\n\n\n                                              89\n\fadmissions,26 and they were offered to prove defendant’s motive or state of mind, not to\nprove his disposition to commit murder. Nor was there any error in concluding the\nevidence was more probative than prejudicial. The disputed evidence was as follows:\n       Charles Stewart Linkletter was permitted to testify to a “diatribe” he heard, while\ndefendant and Mr. Thompson were negotiating their business agreement, in which\ndefendant said “he was going to screw Mickey out of his business” and “rip him off.”\n(See fn. 2, ante.) Then defendant told Mr. Linkletter, “Stew, if you ever say a word about\nthis conversation to anybody, I will fucking kill you.”\n       Defense counsel argued this evidence “bears no relevance to the murder,” and\n“[i]t’s simply to say that [defendant’s] a bad guy.” The trial court disagreed, observing\nthat “the People’s case rests primarily on the fact that they believe that there was a motive\non the part of [defendant] to do harm to the Thompsons, or Mr. Thompson, because of a\nbusiness dispute gone bad leading to a judgment.” And: “[t]his conversation, though, is\nspecifically with reference to the partnership agreement which formed the basis of a\nlawsuit. So I think it’s – I don’t see it as character evidence. I see it as relevant and an\nadmission on the part of [defendant]. And it tends to show his state of mind with respect\nto his business dealings with Mr. Thompson. [¶] In addition, the fact that he makes a\nthreat, allegedly, to Mr. Linkletter, I can’t imagine that that’s being offered by the People\nas [section] 1101 evidence to prove since he made the threat to someone on that occasion,\ntherefore, he made a threat . . . with respect to this occasion, the 1987/’88 litigation.”\n       The court summarized, repeating that the defendant’s statements Mr. Linkletter\noverheard were “certainly relevant with respect to his state of mind, which if one were to\nbelieve the statements that he fully intended to rip off Mr. Thompson, which is similar to\nthe claim, I guess, in the litigation that was pending at the time. [¶] So I do see its\nrelevance and I don’t see it as too prejudicial. I don’t think the People are offering it to\n\n\n26     “Evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when\noffered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party . . . .” (Evid. Code,\n§ 1220.)\n\n\n                                              90\n\fprove conduct in conformity with a character trait. I think they’re offering it for a\npermissible purpose that does not violate [Evidence Code section] 1101, [subdivision]\n(b).”\n        In addition, defendant objected to certain of the testimony of Penn Weldon and\nJeffrey Coyne. Penn Weldon was a private investigator; in addition to testifying that\ndefendant said Mickey Thompson “had ruined his life and he wanted to get even with\nhim,” Mr. Weldon testified defendant wanted him to place listening devices in the home\nand cars of Phillip Bartinetti (Mickey Thompson’s attorney). (See pt. 2.g., ante, of the\nfacts.) Jeffrey Coyne was the bankruptcy trustee who was marshalling the assets of the\nbankruptcy estate; he testified about threats defendant made to him a few weeks before\nthe murders, after a meeting at which Mr. Coyne had refused several demands defendant\nmade relating to payments to and from the bankruptcy estate. (Defendant, trembling and\nin a “black rage,” said, “You better lighten up or things will get bad,” and “If you fuck up\nmy life, I’ll fuck up yours.”)27\n        The trial court said, as to Mr. Weldon’s testimony, that “there was an established\nrelationship between Bartinetti’s law firm; Bartinetti himself with the Thompsons.\nI mean, I don’t know how you separate them. Being angry at Bartinetti is certainly\nrelevant on the issue of one’s anger about the lawsuit which is the stated motive for the\nmurders. So I don’t have a problem with it.” Defendant does not cite any specific\ncomments by the court as to Mr. Coyne’s testimony, but the prosecutor argued that the\nsame animosity defendant felt for Mickey Thompson was extended to both Mr. Coyne\n\n27      In his brief, defendant states that Mr. Coyne “told the jurors he was so afraid of\n[defendant] he got a bullet-proof vest and a concealed weapons permit.” There was no\nsuch testimony before the jury; in a discussion of Mr. Coyne’s prospective testimony, the\nprosecutor told the trial court that the bankruptcy court had approved an application by\nMr. Coyne for a bullet-proof vest and handgun. Mr. Coyne did testify that the threats\ndefendant made to him had an impact on his decision to resign as trustee: “Those\nstatements in conjunction with the deaths of Mickey Thompson and his wife Trudy, left\nme in a place where I could not objectively work with this estate. I was so angry and so\nupset as to have no ability to continue to be fair or even in my own framework be\njustified in continuing to do things that required objectivity.”\n\n\n                                             91\n\fand Mr. Bartinetti. The court observed: “[t]he argument is that the defendant made\ncertain statements which circumstantially tend to indicate that he was going to cause\nharm to Mr. Thompson and did, in fact, cause the death,” and “[w]e’re talking about\nstatements that were made to everyone, . . . including Penn Weldon,” and “these are all\nstatements of [defendant]. And as such, they would qualify as admissions. They tend to\nindicate when taken with other evidence, that he was responsible – [¶] . . . [¶] . . . – for\nthe crime.”\n       And finally, Lance Johnson, a friend of the Thompsons, testified to a threat he\nheard defendant make, years after the murders, to Mickey Thompson’s sister: “You’re\ngoing to get yours, bitch.” The court said the statement was “clearly an admission on the\npart of the defendant. And it tends to show either he is, in fact, the one that is responsible\nfor the death of Mr. Thompson and his wife. Or because of being accused of that, he\nfinds Mrs. Campbell to be the responsible party and now wants to threaten her, which is\nconsciousness of guilt. [¶] . . . The fact of the matter is it is a statement. It’s probative.\nThe prejudicial effect is minimal because this whole case has been basically statements of\nthe defendant.”\n       Defendant argues that “hostility toward people other than Thompson did not prove\nanything related to the murders,” and in any event the relevance of the testimony was\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect. We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ncontrary conclusions on both points. We have just described the court’s analysis in some\ndetail, and that analysis is sound. And even if the testimony were analyzed as evidence\nof “prior offenses” that may not be introduced “solely to prove criminal disposition,”\nsuch testimony “may properly be admitted whenever it tends logically, naturally, and by\nreasonable inference to establish any fact material for the People . . . .” (People v.\nMontalvo (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1123838\"><a href=\"/opinion/1123838/people-v-montalvo/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331-332.) That is the case here.\n       In each instance, the testimony described a statement by defendant that was highly\nrelevant to prove the extreme level of hostility defendant harbored toward\nMr. Thompson, supplying defendant’s motive for the murders. The testimony was not\ncumulative because each witness testified to different circumstances in which defendant\n\n                                              92\n\feffectively expressed his extreme hatred of Mr. Thompson, sustained over time, either\ndirectly or toward those who allied themselves with Mr. Thompson’s interests and\nopposed defendant’s efforts to avoid paying the Thompson judgment. There was nothing\nin the testimony to “confuse[] the jury”; nor was any of the cited testimony significantly\nmore inflammatory than the rest of the evidence. In short, there was no error and, as\nnecessarily follows, no due process violation.28 (See People v. Partida (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576438/people-v-partida/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 [“the admission of evidence, even if erroneous under state law, results in a due\nprocess violation only if it makes the trial fundamentally unfair”].)\n8. Character Evidence – Mickey Thompson\n       Defendant objected on relevance grounds, and in one instance on “character\nevidence” grounds, to a number of questions posed by the prosecutor to several\nwitnesses. On appeal, he argues the trial court prejudicially erred by permitting\n“irrelevant evidence of Thompson’s good character,” and the court “acted contrary to law\n– specifically contrary to Evidence Code [section] 1103” when it admitted the evidence.\nWe find no merit in defendant’s contentions.\n       Only relevant evidence is admissible (Evid. Code, §§ 210, 350), and the trial court\n“lacks discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.” (People v. Benavides (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581604/people-v-benavides/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90.) Evidence is relevant if it “ ‘tends “logically, naturally, and by reasonable\ninference” to establish material facts such as identity, intent, or motive.’ ” (Ibid.) In a\ncriminal action, evidence of the character of the crime victim “is not made inadmissible\nby Section 1101” – which prohibits character evidence to prove conduct on a specified\noccasion – if it is offered by the defendant “to prove conduct of the victim in conformity\n\n28      Again, defendant cites the jury foreman’s declaration stating the jury discussed\n“the character evidence that had been offered against [defendant],” and that “certain\nwitnesses clearly painted [defendant] as a good and honorable fellow and [defendant] as\njust the opposite.” The “bad character” of defendant was “very evident from the\ntestimony of these witnesses,” and “we could not escape the reality that, coupled with his\novertly stated hatred of Mickey Thompson, this guy was the kind of guy who was capable\nof coordinating this event.” These statements cannot be used to impeach the verdict.\n(See fn. 25, ante.)\n\n\n                                              93\n\fwith the character or trait of character,” or if it is offered by the prosecutor to rebut such\nevidence adduced by the defendant. (§ 1103, subd. (a).)\n       We preface our discussion by noting that Evidence Code section 1103 has no\napplication here. No evidence was offered or admitted to prove any conduct by the\nvictim in conformity with his character. The only issue is the relevance of the testimony\nto prove something other than the victim’s character (which is irrelevant). Defendant’s\nclaims of error are as follows.\n       First, William Wilson, who had worked with both Mickey Thompson and\ndefendant on various sports promotions and who had both a professional and social\nrelationship with Mr. Thompson, was permitted to testify about Mr. Thompson’s deep\naffection for his wife, over a defense objection that the question “calls for character\nevidence” and relevance. Mr. Wilson recounted that at their first dinner together, “all\n[Mr. Thompson] could do was talk about Trudy; about how much he loved her; the light\nof my life. And he got her a ‘10’ necklace that she wore on her neck with diamonds.\nAnd he just glowed. You could just tell the man was tremendously in love with Trudy.”\n       Mr. Wilson’s testimony about Mr. Thompson’s love for his wife was not irrelevant\nevidence of his character. It was relevant evidence supporting the inference that the\nshootings were planned in such a way as to force Mr. Thompson to watch his wife being\nmurdered. In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury he would prove that\nMickey Thompson was “kept alive” until he could see his wife being executed. And\nAllison Triarsi gave testimony lending support to that theory, stating that one of the\ngunmen held Mr. Thompson at bay as he pleaded for his wife’s life and while the other\ngunman shot Trudy Thompson. The nature of the Thompsons’ relationship was a\nmaterial point, as the evidence at the murder scene suggested both Thompsons were\ntargeted for killing, while defendant’s acrimony was directed at Mr. Thompson, not at\nTrudy Thompson. Testimony showing that Mr. Thompson’s devotion to his wife was\napparent to his colleagues was thus relevant to show the motive for murdering Trudy\nThompson.\n\n\n\n                                              94\n\f       Second, Gregory Smith, the Anaheim Stadium executive who stopped doing\nbusiness with defendant and hired Mr. Thompson and another company to produce the\nstadium’s motor sports events, testified that it was critical that the promoters they hired\nbe cooperative in promoting each other’s events. After the witness explained how\nMickey Thompson met that criterion, defendant objected, on relevance grounds, to the\nquestion, “Was he [(Mr. Thompson)] easy or difficult to deal with on a business level?”\nMr. Smith was thus permitted to testify that “Mickey Thompson was a very easy, very\nhonorable man to deal with.”\n       Mr. Smith’s testimony was not irrelevant evidence of Mickey Thompson’s\ncharacter. It was relevant evidence explaining why Anaheim Stadium chose to do\nbusiness with Mr. Thompson and not with defendant – a decision that angered defendant,\nand was part and parcel of events explaining the development of defendant’s extreme\nhostility toward Mr. Thompson.\n       Third, Philip Bartinetti, Mr. Thompson’s lawyer, testified that he came to know\nMr. Thompson as more than a client. Over a defense objection on relevance grounds,\nMr. Bartinetti was allowed to testify that their relationship “became a very good\nfriendship.” After a discussion at sidebar where defense counsel objected that the\nprosecutor was trying to elicit good character evidence, the prosecutor said he would end\nhis examination by asking Mr. Bartinetti where and when he found out about Mickey\nThompson’s death. A defense objection on relevance grounds was overruled after the\nprosecutor pointed out that Mr. Bartinetti continued to represent the estate after the\nmurders. Mr. Bartinetti then answered that he was getting ready to go to work and heard\nabout the murders when he received a phone call between 8:00 and 9:00 on the morning\nof the murders.29\n       Defendant does not explain how Mr. Bartinetti’s testimony could be “irrelevant\nevidence of Thompson’s good character,” since the testimony had nothing to do with\nMr. Thompson’s character. In any event, the testimony about the friendship was relevant\n\n29   Defendant says Mr. Bartinetti testified that the phone call was from Collene\nCampbell, but that testimony was stricken from the record.\n\n                                             95\n\fin the context of other evidence the prosecutor later elicited to show that defendant’s rage\nagainst Mr. Thompson was so extreme that it extended to his friends and allies. (See\npt. 7, ante.)\n       Of course, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the probability that its admission will “create substantial danger of undue\nprejudice . . . .” (Evid. Code, § 352.) Defendant says it is “hard to imagine more\nprejudicial facts than that [defendant] – who was known for being loud, obnoxious and\nabusive – was allegedly responsible for the brutal murders of two such beloved\nindividuals,” and that the prosecutor “unfairly set up a good guy / bad guy dichotomy.”\nThis is mere hyperbole. “Evidence is prejudicial within the meaning of . . . section 352 if\nit ‘ “uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual” ’ . . . or if\nit would cause the jury to ‘ “ ‘prejudg[e]’ a person or cause on the basis of extraneous\nfactors.” ’ ” (Cowan, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 475, citations omitted.) None of the\nevidence cited falls into that category.\n       The final claim defendant places in his list of “irrelevant evidence of\nMr. Thompson’s good character” involves a photograph of the victims that was\nintroduced, without objection, for identification purposes. On the first day of testimony,\nduring the afternoon session beginning at 1:30, defense counsel presented her opening\nstatement, after which the prosecution called its first witness, William Wilson. Just\nbefore Mr. Wilson testified, a photograph of the victims was marked for identification,\nand Mr. Wilson identified the victims and testified he knew them personally.\n       Defendant complains that the prosecutors left the photograph on the projector for\nthe jury to see “during the entire first day’s proceedings” (a clear exaggeration), and that\nit was “misconduct” to display a sympathetic photograph to the jury “long after the\npurpose of the display had been satisfied.” But the trial court could not see the display\nfrom the bench, and defense counsel did not object until the following day. The trial\ncourt pointed out that the controls to the projector were “right there,” and one of\ndefendant’s attorneys indicated that he had eventually covered the projector.\n\n\n\n                                              96\n\f       But defense counsel told the court “it’s bad form to do it in the first place, and they\nknow it,” and asked the court “to admonish them that . . . we’re all aware that this was a\ntrick that happened yesterday and ask that it not be repeated.” The court said, “I can’t say\nit was a trick,” and that the simplest thing for defense counsel to have done was to ask,\n“Can we approach?” Defense counsel responded that, if she had done so, the photograph\nwould have been removed and “it would have been quite obvious that we objected to this\nnice family photo being up in front of the jury.” When the court then asked what defense\ncounsel wanted the court to do, counsel said, “Nothing. We’ve had the discussion.\nThat’s all I was asking.” The court reiterated that it could not do anything unless\nsomething is brought to its attention, “[a]nd I think either counsel can hit that kill switch\n[to turn off the projector]. . . . So, I mean, that’s – it’s there. I don’t have access to it, but\nyou do.”\n       The nature of defendant’s claim of error on this point is unclear, but it is clear\nthere was no error. The photograph was properly admitted for identification and thus was\nnot “irrelevant evidence of good character.” The trial court cannot correct a problem of\nwhich it is not made aware, and there was no showing of deliberate prosecutorial\nmisconduct, prejudicial or otherwise.

It is not enough\nthat another person has the motive or opportunity to commit it.”].)\n       Defendant contends the court denied him due process by excluding evidence of\nthird party culpability found in Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department investigative files on\nthe Thompson murders. We disagree.\n       a. Defendant’s third party culpability theory\n       Defendant proposed to show that a man named Dean Kennedy ordered the\nThompson murders, and they were committed by John Young (a very tall, athletically\nbuilt black man) and Kit Paepule (a dark-skinned, very stocky man of Samoan descent).\nThe theory was that Kennedy ordered the Thompson murders at the instance of a man\nnamed Larry Cowell, who had a motive for having the Thompsons murdered.\n       Cowell’s motive for murdering the Thompsons stemmed from Cowell having\nkilled Scott Campbell (Collene Campbell’s son and Mickey Thompson’s nephew). Scott\nCampbell was a drug dealer who in 1979 was convicted of manslaughter in the killing of\nanother drug dealer who had ties to the Vagos motorcycle gang. Cowell, who owned an\nauto repair shop for Pantera sports cars (a type of expensive sports car that Scott\nCampbell owned) had been a friend of the Thompson and Campbell families for years.\n       In 1982, Scott Campbell, who was then the target of an investigation of interstate\ntransportation of cocaine, arranged for Cowell to fly him in a private plane to North\nDakota in connection with an anticipated cocaine sale. Before the trip, he left his Pantera\n\n                                             98\n\fat Cowell’s shop for repairs. During the flight, Cowell and Donny DiMascio killed Scott\nCampbell and threw him out of the plane. The primary motive was robbery, but\nDiMascio was a known Vagos motorcycle gang associate, and the Vagos gang had been\nthreatening Scott Campbell since the 1979 killing.\n       Mickey Thompson testified at Larry Cowell’s first trial for the murder of Scott\nCampbell. Cowell had tried to fabricate an alibi for the murder by leaving telephone\nmessages for Scott Campbell (while he was missing during the weeks after the murder);\nthe messages said Campbell’s car was ready to be picked up after extensive repairs.\nMr. Thompson testified that he and the police went to Cowell’s shop, and Mr. Thompson\nsaw that the car was in pieces and missing major parts (as defendant puts it, “the car had\nnot been repaired at all – ruining the alibi”). Cowell was convicted, but the conviction\nwas overturned based on a coerced confession, and Mickey Thompson was killed before\nthe second trial (at which Cowell was again convicted).30\n       The theory continues: Cowell, who thus had motive, was a close friend of Ed\nLosinski (who owned a Pantera and used Cowell’s repair shop). Losinski was an\nengineer and mason who had also known Mickey Thompson for years, had worked on\nthe Thompson property and would know the neighborhood. Ed Losinski was also a good\nfriend of Dean Kennedy, whom he had met through the boat racing community; they both\nhad shops in the same area. Dean Kennedy, in December 1987, ordered two other\nmurders; he sent John Young and Kit Paepule to kill a drug dealer named Thomas Wilson\n(and his girlfriend if she were present), and a week later hired Young to kill Jerome\nGenoway (who was being investigated for drug dealing) and the woman who lived with\nhim (if she was present). Kennedy’s alleged motive for having Wilson killed was that he\nhad burglarized Kennedy’s home and was “disrespectful,” and his motive for having\nGenoway killed was to avoid paying money he owed Genoway. In taped conversations\n\n\n30      Respondent points out that Mr. Thompson’s testimony was not critical. He\ntestified that he saw the car at Cowell’s shop, missing major parts that were necessary for\noperation of the car, but that occurred a year after Scott Campbell’s murder.\n\n\n                                            99\n\fbetween Kennedy and a drug-smuggling friend, Kennedy said he was not worried about\ndoing time for the Wilson and Genoway murders, because he had a friend who was\nwilling to take the fall for him in return for cash. (Kennedy was convicted of these\nmurders and was in custody at the time of the Thompson murders.)\n       In addition: Richard Passmore, a neighbor of the Thompsons, saw a maroon\nVolvo with two athletic-looking African-American men unloading bicycles within a\ncouple of blocks of the murder scene a day or two before the murders. Larry Shaleen, a\nclose friend of Dean Kennedy, saw John Young (one of Kennedy’s hit men) driving a\nmaroon Volvo in the past. Shaleen visited Kennedy just before Kennedy was arrested,\nand noticed two brand new 10-speed bicycles in Kennedy’s garage, when Kennedy was\ntoo overweight to ride a bicycle. (Two of Kennedy’s neighbors, Linda Osborne and\nKathy O’Neill, also saw the bikes, and they heard Kennedy brag about knowing Mickey\nThompson “and about knowing the killers of Mickey Thompson’s nephew Scott\nCampbell.”) Hit man John Young “bears an uncanny resemblance” to the composite\ndrawings made of the men who killed the Thompsons, and his companion Kit Paepule\nhabitually wore a hooded sweatshirt, as in the composite drawing of the stockier shooter.\n(Linda Osborne and Kathy O’Neill also thought the composite drawing of the Mickey\nThompson shooter was John Young.)\n       Finally, the defense also sought to introduce evidence to show “that a local drug\nuser named Joey Hunter was their lookout for this crime.” (We have referred to some of\nthis evidence in pt. 3.c.x.A. & H., ante.) Five witnesses saw a white man “hitchhiking\nfrantically” with a bicycle at a bus stop, about two and a half miles from the crime scene\nand shortly after the murders. Two of those witnesses identified Mr. Hunter from a\nphotographic lineup. (The others identified someone other than Hunter, or said the\nperson they saw was not in the photographs they were shown.) Mr. Hunter was arrested.\nHe failed polygraph tests regarding his involvement in the Thompson murders, and told a\nfellow inmate that he was involved in the murders. He also confessed his involvement to\nhis cousin, Bonnie Dalton, telling her he was not worried about doing hard time, because\nhe worked for someone who promised him that if he took the fall he would only get two\n\n                                           100\n\fyears and would get $50,000.31 (The defense points out that Dean Kennedy similarly\nsaid, as noted above, that he had a friend who was willing to take the fall for the Wilson\nand Genoway murders in return for cash.)\n       In sum, the defense intended to show – “through the testimony of Larry Shaleen,\nRichard Passmore, Linda Osborne, and Kathy O’Neill,” as well as through the testimony\nof the two detectives who investigated the Wilson and Genoway murders – “that Dean\nKennedy and his hit men were responsible for the death of Mickey and Trudy\nThompson.” And the defense also intended to show that Joey Hunter was their lookout.\n       b. The trial court’s ruling\n       The court ruled that the connection “between Kennedy and Larry Cowell coupled\nwith presumably the two hit men . . . all of that I don’t see any connection. . . . It\ncertainly made for interesting reading . . . . But I don’t see even a remote theory here of\nrelevance.”\n       As for the Joey Hunter evidence, the court observed that “if, in fact, there are two\nwitnesses who put Joey Hunter at the scene and there are statements by Joey Hunter\nwhich can be construed as confessions or admissions at that point, perhaps there is\nsomething relevant.” Defense counsel then confirmed its offer of proof as stated by the\ncourt, and further that Joey Hunter’s statement to Ms. Dalton about being paid $50,000 to\ntake the fall was “a connection in and of itself to Dean Kennedy who indicated the exact\nsame plan.” The court responded, “it could be. But so it’s so tenuous, I don’t see this.”\n\n31      The prosecutor argued the confession to Hunter’s cousin, Bonnie Dalton, was\nunreliable. The prosecutor explained that, before Hunter was interviewed by the police\n(but after he was aware of the police’s interest in him), Ms. Dalton asked him if he\nmurdered the Thompsons, “to which he replied that he did not. Hunter then sarcastically\nsaid ‘I did it, Bonnie, I killed them.’ When she did not respond, he then started laughing\nand said ‘Ha, ha, you believe me, don’t you?’ Dalton then told Hunter that he was ‘full\nof shit,’ and the conversation ended.” And on the day before Hunter went to the police,\n“he got drunk and began rambling. Hunter told Dalton that he was the man on the\nbicycle and that the killers were not black but white men spray painted black. He also\nsaid that the Mafia wanted him to turn himself in, and that he would only get two years in\nprison. He said that the Mafia would pay him $50,000 for his time in jail.”\n\n\n                                             101\n\fDefense counsel replied that “when you combine all of them” – referring to John Young\ndriving a maroon Volvo and bicycles at Kennedy’s house when he could not ride them –\nwith Kennedy, who committed other horrific murders “very similar” to the Thompson\nmurders, “then the relevance comes. [W]hat we’re failing to do is put them all together.”\n       The court said “[t]here is a reason I can’t put them all together because the\nconnection or the links that you refer to are really tenuous. I just don’t see any\nconnection whatsoever between [the other contract murders] with this case.” “[I]n terms\nof relevance, I don’t see it. . . . What I am willing to say at this point is there may be\nsome relevant information with respect to the Joey Hunter connection.”\n       The court then invited counsel to “[t]ell me how under [Evidence Code\nsection] 352, the weighing and balancing, would dictate that I allow that information to\ncome in. Because it does require the testimony of two witnesses who will say that was\nhim. It does require that the cousin will attribute the two statements to him which could\ntend to incriminate him. But I can’t draw any other inferences from any of that. So I’m\nleft with a perhaps on Joey Hunter.”\n       The prosecutor argued defendant could not show the hitchhiker was relevant to the\nmurder, that it was unlikely Joey Hunter was the hitchhiker, Joey Hunter had an alibi, his\nstatements to his cousin were “asinine remarks,” and his alleged confession to deceased\ninmate Frank Gullet was inadmissible. The tenuous nature of the evidence surrounding\nMr. Hunter was “no better than the other 1300 clues that we’ve had saying I know the\nwhite guy on the bicycle.”\n       The court asked defense counsel if Joey Hunter could be connected to the crime\nscene, since the defense theory was that he was a lookout, not one of the perpetrators.\nCounsel said that two witnesses said the shooter at the bottom of the driveway “could\nhave been white.” Also, counsel had spoken to the person who gave Mr. Hunter an alibi,\nand if that person were to testify, he would say he had no recollection whatsoever. One\nof Trudy Thompson’s several broken-off acrylic fingernails was found east of the\ndriveway where her body lay, and counsel said this was circumstantial evidence she had\n\n\n\n                                             102\n\frun out of the driveway and then turned back because someone was standing on Woodlyn\nLane, and that person would have had to be white to avoid attracting attention.\n       The court then said that “it just boils down to what I seem to think potentially\nmight have relevance is Joey Hunter. But, again, that depends on a connection between\nJoey Hunter and the crime scene. And I’m not hearing it.” The court concluded that\n“whatever relevance the information regarding Joey Hunter might have, at this time I\ncan’t say that that relevance outweighs the undue consumption of time; confusion of the\nissues; and the potential for prejudice. But primarily the undue consumption of time and\nthe confusion of the issues. [¶] . . . I’m not finding that connection which I would like\nto see. So I’m not foreclosing this forever. I’m just saying right now I agree there is\nsome evidence to suggest that at least according to Bonnie Dalton that this Joey Hunter\nhad admitted some responsibility for the murders. [¶] Other than that . . . there are then\ntwo potential witnesses . . . who place Joey Hunter perhaps a few miles away hitchhiking\nwith a bicycle. At this point, I just don’t have that missing link. [¶] If . . . any of the\nwitnesses that I hear at the trial refer to an individual who appears to match the\ndescription of Joey Hunter as a look-out, I’m certainly willing to change my mind. But at\nthis point, I think it has marginal relevance. And the other side of that, under [Evidence\nCode section] 352, just overwhelms and outweighs the marginal relevance I think it has.”\n       c. Conclusions\n       We see no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of the proffered evidence of third\nparty culpability.\n       Hall is quite clear, and we repeat: “[E]vidence of mere motive or opportunity to\ncommit the crime in another person, without more, will not suffice to raise a reasonable\ndoubt about a defendant’s guilt: there must be direct or circumstantial evidence linking\nthe third person to the actual perpetration of the crime.” (Hall, supra, 41 Cal.3d at\np. 833.)\n       As to the theory that Dean Kennedy ordered the murders, there was no link at all\nbetween him and “the actual perpetration of the crime.” To recap: The only third person\nidentified with a conceivable motive was Larry Cowell, who may have wanted to prevent\n\n                                              103\n\fMickey Thompson from testifying at his second trial. But there was no connection\nbetween Cowell and Kennedy, except (1) they were both friends of Ed Losinski, who was\nfamiliar with the Thompson neighborhood, and (2) two of Kennedy’s neighbors said that\nKennedy said that he knew Scott Campbell’s murderers (of whom Cowell was one). But\nevidence – even if it were not inadmissible hearsay – that Kennedy knew Cowell does not\nby any stretch of the imagination create a link to the Thompson murders. (According to\nthe prosecutor, in January 1998 Kennedy was specifically asked if he knew Cowell, and\nconfirmed he did not.) And except for the hearsay statement from Kennedy’s neighbors\n(that he bragged that he knew Mickey Thompson), there was no evidence linking\nKennedy himself to the Thompsons, much less to their murders. In addition, both\nKennedy and Cowell were in custody, in separate facilities in different parts of\nCalifornia, when the Thompsons were murdered. In short, under the Hall requirements,\nthe Dean Kennedy evidence was plainly not relevant. (Hall, supra, 41 Cal.3d at p. 833;\nPeople v. Edelbacher (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1349539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1349539/people-v-edelbacher/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1018 [“Quite apart from the obvious hearsay\nproblems, defendant’s proposed evidence did not . . . link any third person to the\ncommission of the crime.”].)\n       As to the theory that Joey Hunter was the lookout, there was likewise no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court’s exclusion of defendant’s proffered evidence. Mr. Hunter himself\nhad no motive to murder the Thompsons; defendant showed no connection of any kind\nbetween Joey Hunter and Larry Cowell or Dean Kennedy or Ed Losinski or Kennedy’s\ntwo hit men for the other contract murders; and there is no evidence Joey Hunter was at\nthe crime scene. And, as respondent points out, the actual perpetrators of the Thompson\nmurders made their escape from the scene in minutes over a bike route leading to quick\nfreeway access – so even if Hunter was correctly identified as the man “frantically\nhitchhiking” with a bicycle, two miles from the murder scene and an hour later, it is hard\nto see how he could have been part of the conspirators’ plan for the Thompson murders.\nSo in the end, in light of the lack of any evidence linking Joey Hunter to the crime scene,\nonly his own statements to his cousin (see fn. 31, ante) and to deceased inmate Frank\nGullet (see pt. 3.c.x.H., ante) provide any kind of connection to the “actual perpetration\n\n                                            104\n\fof the crime.” Under these circumstances, the court did not err in finding that under\nEvidence Code section 352, the undue consumption of time and confusion of the issues\n“just overwhelms and outweighs the marginal relevance” of the Joey Hunter evidence.\n       Having failed to show any link between the Dean Kennedy/Larry Cowell evidence\nand “the actual perpetration of the crime,” or between Kennedy or Cowell or anyone else\nand Joey Hunter, defendant asserts that it was error to evaluate the evidence “solely under\nthe third party culpability standard” required by Hall. This is because “the point of this\nproposed evidence was not to show that a specific third party was guilty of the offense\ncharged,” as in Hall, “but rather to show the investigators were given information about\nJoey Hunter and other likely suspects and did not even pursue it.” Because of this\n“failure to pursue other leads,” defendant says, it is “unreasonable” to require him to\ncomply with Hall by presenting evidence that links those other suspects to the crime.\nThe exclusion of “the proposed evidence of what the police failed to do when\ninvestigating the Thompson murders,” he says, violated his due process rights; that\nevidence “would have helped prove what defense counsel identified as the central issue\nof [defendant’s] defense: if evidence did not point to [defendant], then investigators\nwould not look at it.” The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department investigators “could have\nbeen questioned about the information in their investigative reports,” which were “[t]he\nsources of most of the evidence that other people committed the Thompson\nmurders . . . .”\n       We note first that the assertion, repeated many times in defendant’s briefs, that\ninvestigators would not look at evidence if it did not point to defendant, is only that: an\nassertion without support in the record. The police obviously did investigate Joey Hunter\n(and indeed arrested him at an early stage).32 In 1998, police interviewed Kit Paepule\n\n32     Apparently defendant’s complaint is that Detective Griggs did not interview Joey\nHunter, and that “investigators never contacted Hunter again after 1988.” (Defense\ncounsel below asserted, “every single time this case was reopened, not a single\ninvestigator went to contact [Joey Hunter].” She claimed this was relevant to the defense,\n“separate and apart whether we are blaming him for the murder. It’s not for the truth of\nwhatever he was or whatever he did, it’s for the fact that because somewhere along the\n\n                                            105\n\fand John Young about the Thompson murders, both of whom denied involvement.\n(Young, serving life without parole, took full responsibility for the Wilson/Genoway\nmurders but adamantly denied any involvement in the Thompson murders.) Apparently,\npolice also interviewed Dean Kennedy, who denied knowing Larry Cowell. The\nsuggestion that police did not continue to pursue Joey Hunter after 1988, because\nsomehow they knew Hunter would not implicate defendant in the plot, is little short of\nludicrous. As the trial court noted at the hearing on defendant’s new trial motion, even if\ndefendant could show Joey Hunter was present as a look-out – and the defense presented\nno such evidence – that “doesn’t mean that there is a reasonable doubt that [defendant]\nwas involved.”\n       In short, it is complete speculation to suggest that the reason defendant could not\nestablish the requisite link between Dean Kennedy (or any of the other hypothetical\nconspirators) and the crime was because the police “conducted a wholly inadequate,\nbotched investigation,” thus violating defendant’s due process rights. There is simply no\nreason to believe that, if only the police had investigated other suspects further than they\ndid, they would have been able to connect Dean Kennedy or Joey Hunter or any of the\nothers to the murders.33 Defendant cites no legal authority for the notion that, because\ncounsel identified the claim of a “botched” or “biased” investigation as the “central issue\nof [defendant’s] defense,” the court therefore “had to permit him to use any available\nevidence casting doubt” on the investigation, without regard to the rules of evidence. We\n\n\nline some investigator said this guy is never going to lead you to [defendant], no\ninvestigator subsequently sat down with an interview with Joey Hunter; not since 1988.\nAnd that is relevant. And to be precluded from that is to be precluded from having a\ndefense in general.”) The trial court pointed out that was not the motion before the court,\nand “I can’t say without hearing what is going to be presented that you would not be able\nto elicit testimony regarding what leads were followed and what leads were ignored. I’m\njust not prepared to say that.”\n\n33     Defendant’s example of the “botched investigation” – other than not re-\ninvestigating Joey Hunter after 1988 – was that investigators never tested fingernail\nscrapings taken from the Thompsons (the defense later did so, with no useful results).\n\n\n                                            106\n\fthus reject defendant’s attempt to avoid the application of the principles established in\nHall for the exclusion of third party exculpatory evidence – principles correctly applied\nby the trial court when it excluded the proffered testimony.\n       Defendant’s reliance on cases such as Chambers v. Mississippi (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Chambers) for his due process claim does not persuade us otherwise. In Chambers,\nthe application of state evidentiary rules, “under the facts and circumstances of [that]\ncase,” deprived the defendant of a fair trial. (Id. at p. 303.) There, a third person named\nMcDonald had signed a sworn confession and later repudiated it. (Id. at pp. 288-289.)\nAt defendant Chambers’ trial, the state court excluded hearsay testimony critical to the\ndefense: testimony that McDonald had orally confessed the murder to three different\nfriends (confessions that were corroborated by other evidence in the case, and that bore\npersuasive assurances of trustworthiness). This exclusion – coupled with the state’s\nrefusal to permit the defendant to cross-examine McDonald because of a state rule that a\nparty may not impeach his own witness – denied the defendant a trial “in accord with\ntraditional and fundamental standards of due process.” (Id. at p. 302.)\n       This is not a case like Chambers. As the high court tells us, “Chambers\nspecifically confined its holding to the ‘facts and circumstances’ presented in that case;\nwe thus stressed that the ruling did not ‘signal any diminution in the respect traditionally\naccorded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial\nrules and procedures.’ [Citation.] Chambers therefore does not stand for the proposition\nthat the accused is denied a fair opportunity to defend himself whenever a state or federal\nrule excludes favorable evidence.” (United States v.

The Exclusion of Hearsay Evidence of Mickey Thompson’s Purchase\n    or Intent to Purchase Gold Just Before the Murders\n       a. The factual background and rulings\n       During the case-in-chief, defense counsel asked Detective Verdugo if he had any\nreason to believe Mickey Thompson had recently made a large purchase of gold coins,\nbut the detective knew nothing about that. Later, during the defense case, defense\ncounsel offered to present testimony that, in the weeks and months before the murders,\nMr. Thompson talked about buying gold, and the night before the murder, Eric Miller\nheard him say that he had just taken possession of $250,000 in gold. (See pt. 7.b. of the\nfacts, ante.)\n       Defense counsel agreed with the trial court that the defense wanted “to show that\nbasically Mr. Thompson was announcing to others his plan to acquire a large amount of\ngold.” The trial court observed that “[w]e’re not dealing with a hearsay exception, we’re\ndealing with circumstantial evidence to show that others may have had a motive.” The\ncourt said that if the defense could show the safe in the garage was empty and had pry\nmarks on it, the testimony “may have a great deal of relevance.” The court concluded it\n“would like to hear the foundation that the safe was empty and there were pry marks,”\nand if that testimony were presented, Mr. Miller’s testimony would be relevant as\ncircumstantial evidence of motive. “So I’m certainly happy to reconsider [the\nadmissibility of Mr. Miller’s testimony] based on what the defense has yet to present.”\n       The next day, the prosecutor told the court that police reports showed the damage\nto the garage safe occurred weeks after the murders. The court agreed that, if the defense\ncould not show that the safe had been tampered with on the day of the murders, then the\nnecessary foundation for relevance of the proffered testimony would be missing.\n\n\n\n                                           109\n\f       Defense counsel then stated that Lee Haslam and other witnesses would say that\nMr. Thompson said he intended to buy gold, “which is a different statement” and\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1250. (Section 1250 is an exception to the rule\nagainst hearsay, for “a statement of the declarant’s then existing state of mind, . . .\n(including a statement of intent [or] plan . . . ),” when the evidence “is offered to prove\nthe declarant’s state of mind . . . at that time or at any other time when it is itself an issue\nin the action,” or when it is “offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of the declarant.”\n(§ 1250, subd. (a).)) The court said that Mr. Thompson’s “state of mind with respect to\npurchase of gold” was not an issue in the case. If there were evidence there was gold in\nthe house and there was gold taken, the court said, that could be presented, but even if\nMr. Thompson’s statements could be admitted as a state of mind exception, “the\nrelevance of that is speculative at best.”\n       Defense counsel then asked to present testimony from Detective Laporte about\nMr. Miller’s statement. This testimony “would not be offered for the truth,” but for the\n“failure to investigate whether or not there were valuables in this garage.” The trial court\nagreed that the defense could “present all you want about the failure to investigate,” but\n“a statement made by Mr. Thompson prior to the murders that he was going to buy gold\ndoesn’t lead us anywhere.” The court said the defense could “ask the question as to what\n[the police] did or what they didn’t do without assuming facts that aren’t in\nevidence. . . .” When defense counsel sought to elicit testimony from Detective Laporte\nthat Mr. Miller told him Mr. Thompson had made a large purchase of gold recently,\nsaying it was “not offered for the truth,” but “to see what he did as a result of that\ninformation,” the court sustained the prosecutor’s hearsay objection. Detective Laporte\nthen testified that his notes showed he interviewed Eric Miller and Lee Haslam; his\nreports would have been given to the lead investigators; and he did not try to obtain any\nfinancial records.\n       Then, defense counsel sought to introduce Mr. Miller’s testimony about Mickey\nThompson’s statement, not for its truth, but “to explain why we’re asking these officers”\nwhether they sought Mr. Thompson’s financial records, that is, “for the purpose of\n\n                                              110\n\fshowing that the police did not investigate that angle.” When the court asked defense\ncounsel why she could not elicit the information “in a way that would meet your needs,\nwhich is: Did Mr. Miller provide information to the investigators which was not\nfollowed up,” counsel said that would be out of context, “[w]ithout saying that it was\ninformation about a recent purchase of a significant valuable item.” The court asked,\n“Well, why not refer to it that way,” and counsel responded, “I would love to refer to it\nthat way. That’s why I’m asking the court’s guidance as to that. I would be happy to not\nbring up the quote of the statement if I could say to Officer Laporte: Did you receive\ninformation from Eric Miller that Mr. Thompson had just come into a very valuable\ncommodity in the last several days?” And “the only thing further I would go is: What\ndid you do as a result? What did you follow-up on?” The court ruled: “I think that’s\nfair. Because we’re dealing with a statement that’s not being offered for the truth. But\nI’m attempting to sanitize it so that there is no danger of this jury being misled.” Further,\n“I don’t see a danger here in eliciting this type of testimony keeping it limited without\nreference to gold. I mean I’m just afraid that the jury will misconstrue it or be misled.\nSo I think the way we just agreed to handle it is appropriate.”\n       Defense counsel then elicited testimony from Eric Miller and Detective Laporte.\nWhen Mr. Miller was asked if he told Detective Laporte that Mickey Thompson had\ntaken possession of a valuable item recently, Mr. Miller said he “[did not] recall anything\nregarding taking possession, no.” When asked if Mr. Thompson indicated he had made a\nrecent purchase, Mr. Miller said, “No.” As previously described (pt. 7.b. of the facts,\nante), Detective Laporte then testified that Eric Miller had told him Mr. Thompson said\nhe had taken possession of a valuable item of a specific dollar amount, and that he\n(Detective Laporte) did not, and was not directed to, match up the dollar amount\nspecified with any of Mr. Thompson’s financial records, or look at his financial records at\nall. (The trial court admonished the jury that “this is being offered not for the truth of\nwhat Mr. Thompson may have said to Mr. Miller, but to explain the conduct of Officer\nLaporte.”)\n\n\n\n                                             111\n\f       b. Contentions and conclusions\n       On appeal, defendant argues that Mr. Thompson’s statements “about buying or\nhaving received gold were statements of intent . . . to perform an act and admissible to\nprove Thompson bought and received gold.” Defendant contends the trial court erred in\n“sanitizing” the testimony so that there was no reference to gold; this deprived him of key\nevidence that the killers were there to rob, not execute, the Thompsons, “and\ninvestigators ignored this lead in their zeal to see [defendant] prosecuted,” violating his\nright to present a defense.\n       We find no error by the trial court.\n       First, Mr. Thompson’s statement that he had recently taken possession of a large\namount of gold is not a statement of his “existing state of mind” or “intent” or “plan.” It\nis hearsay as to which there is no applicable exception.\n       Second, the other statements defendant proffered – from Lee Haslam and others\nthat Mr. Thompson said he intended to purchase gold – are statements of intent or plan.\nBut to be admissible under Evidence Code section 1250, Mr. Thompson’s intent to\npurchase gold must be “itself an issue in the action” (id., subd. (a)), and it was not. To\nthe extent defendant suggests Mr. Thompson’s statements of intent to purchase gold were\noffered to prove that he did purchase gold – that is, if the statements were “offered to\nprove . . . conduct of the declarant” (ibid.) – it is irrelevant. Mr. Thompson’s state of\nmind (intent to buy gold) would have been relevant had there been any evidence of a\nrobbery, or evidence that he communicated his intent to someone involved in the\nmurders, or evidence there was gold on the premises, but there was no such evidence.\nThe only evidence defendant can cite is that, according to one witness, one of the\nescaping bicyclists was carrying a white canvas bag, and a coin dealer testified that gold\ncoins are delivered in white canvas bags (usually with a metal seal on the top).35\n\n\n\n35     Lance Johnson described a small bag, about 12 inches long and four inches wide,\n“slung over the right shoulder” of the first bicyclist he could see; the bag “went up to a\ndrawstring, so it was more or less pear shaped,” and he could not remember the color.\n\n                                              112\n\f       Evidence of a gunman fleeing on a bicycle with a white canvas bag, however, is\nnot credible evidence of a robbery, and all the evidence was to the contrary. There was\nno evidence valuables were taken; there was evidence of money and jewelry left at the\nscene of the crime; there was no evidence of forced entry into the house; the garage door\nwas closed; and there was no evidence of pry marks on the garage safe on the day of the\nmurders. Under these circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to admit\nhearsay evidence that Mr. Thompson intended to buy gold.\n       Defendant insists the evidence was admissible under People v. Alcalde (1944) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1422423\"><a href=\"/opinion/1422423/people-v-alcalde/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (Alcalde), where the court stated the “[e]lements essential to\nadmissibility” of declarations of intent to do an act in the future. (The Legislature later\ncodified the Alcalde decision in Evidence Code section 1250.) (See People v. Majors\n(1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433751/people-v-majors/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (Majors).) These essential elements are “ ‘that the\ndeclaration must tend to prove the declarant’s intention at the time it was made; it must\nhave been made under circumstances which naturally give verity to the utterance; it must\nbe relevant to an issue in the case.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Alcalde, at p. 187.) Defendant’s\nclaim again falters on the relevance element.\n       As Majors tells us, Alcalde “considered the admissibility of a decedent’s statement\nthat she was planning to go out with a man named Frank, the defendant’s nickname, on\nthe night she was killed.” (Majors, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 404.) Applying the essential\nelements test, Alcalde concluded that the murder victim’s statement was admissible\nbecause “it was a natural utterance made under circumstances which could create no\nsuspicion of untruth in the statement of her intent,” and “[u]nquestionably the deceased’s\nstatement of her intent and the logical inference to be drawn therefrom, namely, that she\nwas with the defendant that night, were relevant to the issue of the guilt of the\ndefendant.” (Alcalde, supra, 24 Cal.2d at pp. 187-188, italics added.) In addition, in\nAlcalde “the declaration was not the only fact from which an inference could be drawn\n\n\nSandra Johnson told police that one of the men was carrying a white canvas bag,\nshopping bag size.\n\n\n                                             113\n\fthat the deceased was with the defendant that night.” (Id. at p. 188; see also Majors, at p.\n405 [“[a]s in Alcalde, there are ample ‘corroborating circumstances’ ”].)\n       Defendant claims the three essential elements in Alcalde were met, but we do not\nagree. There is no “logical inference” to be drawn from Mr. Thompson’s statements that\nhe intended to buy gold, and consequently there is no relevance to any issue in the case.\nWe cannot logically infer from Mr. Thompson’s statements that the gold was at the\nThompson residence, or that the Thompson murderers knew about it, or that there was a\nrobbery. Mr. Thompson’s intent to buy gold is only relevant if there were evidence of a\nrobbery, and there was not. Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial\ncourt’s rulings that testimony about Mr. Thompson’s statements was hearsay and\ninadmissible for its truth.\n       As described above, the trial court permitted the defense to inquire about Mickey\nThompson’s statement to Mr. Miller, not for its truth, but in order to prove an inadequate\npolice investigation of Mr. Thompson’s purchase of gold (which would have been\ntraceable). Defendant asserts the court had no authority to “sanitize” the statement so\nthat it referred to a valuable item, rather than gold, and that this “vitiated the meaning and\nthe impact of the evidence.”\n       Defendant cites no authority for this claim, and we know of none. The evidence\nwas admitted for a limited purpose, and that purpose was served when defendant was\npermitted to elicit testimony that police did not investigate the recent purchase of a\nvaluable item or look at Mr. Thompson’s financial records at all. The court’s ruling\nallowed the defense to make its point about inadequate investigation, while avoiding\nhaving the jury misled by the unsupportable implication there was gold on the premises.\nThere was no error in the trial court’s approach.\n11. The Exclusion of Evidence that Joey Hunter Failed Three Polygraph\n    Examinations\n       Evidence Code section 351.1 prohibits the admission of polygraph evidence in any\ncriminal proceeding: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the results of a\npolygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer\n\n\n                                             114\n\fto take, failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination, shall not be admitted into\nevidence in any criminal proceeding, . . . unless all parties stipulate to the admission of\nsuch results.” (Id., subd. (a).)\n       Despite the clarity of the statutory prohibition, defendant contends the trial court\nshould have admitted evidence that Joey Hunter failed three polygraph examinations,\neven though the prosecutor would not stipulate. The exclusion of the evidence that Joey\nHunter failed polygraph tests, he says, “prevented him from impeaching Griggs,\nLillienfeld and the other investigators on a crucial issue – whether the murders were fully\nand fairly investigated.”\n       When the trial court refused to admit the evidence, it pointed out that it had\nexcluded third-party culpability evidence, and consequently, “even assuming that you are\nnot violating [Evidence Code] section 351.1, how is this relevant? I just don’t see the\nrelevance . . . given the third-party culpability hearing that we had and the rulings that I\nmade. [¶] I think you can certainly present your witnesses to testify as to what was done\nand what wasn’t done to some extent. But I don’t think you can go that far. I do believe\nit’s an exclusionary rule that basically precludes any reference to a polygraph in this case.\nAnd that is my ruling.”\n       There was no error in the trial court’s ruling. The statute unambiguously states\nthat “the results of a polygraph examination . . . shall not be admitted into evidence in any\ncriminal proceeding . . . .” (Evid. Code, § 351.1, subd. (a).) “The statutory ban against\nadmission of polygraph evidence ‘ “is a ‘rational and proportional means of advancing\nthe legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence.’ ” ’ [Citations.]” (People v.\nMcKinnon (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844251\"><a href=\"/opinion/844251/people-v-mckinnon/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663 (McKinnon).) The statute contains no exceptions\nto the rule. (Ibid. [“The state’s exclusion of polygraph evidence is adorned with no\nexceptions, and its stricture on admission of such evidence has been uniformly enforced\nby this court and the Court of Appeal.”].)\n       Further, the categorical rule against the admission of polygraph evidence does not\nviolate due process or the right to present a defense. (People v. Richardson (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1032 [“in People v.

In McKinnon, the court expressly rejected a claim that\npolygraph evidence was properly admitted, “not to endorse or attack the credibility of\nanswers given during a polygraph examination, but to explain why [a witness], in his\npostpolygraph statement to police, changed his story about his involvement in the murder\nand implicated defendant as the killer.” (McKinnon, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 663\n[declining to recognize “a state-of-mind exception to . . . section 351.1 for this limited\npurpose”].) Similarly, in People v. Samuels (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570207\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570207/people-v-samuels/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128, evidence that the\ndefendant cooperated with police by offering to take, and passing, a polygraph\n\n36      Defendant cites several Ninth Circuit cases saying that polygraph evidence is\ninadmissible if offered to prove the truth or falsity of the polygraph results, but\n“polygraph evidence which is an operative fact may be admissible.” (United States v.\nBowen (9th Cir. 1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512037\"><a href=\"/opinion/512037/united-states-v-william-a-bowen-united-states-of-america-v-kevin-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1341 [“If the polygraph evidence is being\nintroduced because it is relevant that a polygraph examination was given, regardless of\nthe result, then it may be admissible; or if the evidence is being introduced as a basis for a\ncause of action, then it may be admissible as well.”].) Here, the polygraph evidence does\nnot fit in either of those categories, and in any event none of the cases defendant cites\ninvolves Evidence Code section 351.1 (or any other statute) expressly stating that “the\nresults of a polygraph examination . . . shall not be admitted into evidence in any criminal\nproceeding . . . .”\n\n\n                                             116\n\fexamination was not admissible to refute the prosecution’s evidence that the defendant\nwas uncooperative during the investigation.\n       In the face of these authorities, defendant’s contention that an exception to\nEvidence Code section 351.1 should be made, where polygraph results are offered to\n“impeach[] the investigation,” is without merit. The trial court did not err.\n12. The Conspiracy Instructions\n       Defendant contends the trial court’s instructions on uncharged conspiracy vitiated\nthe presumption of innocence and lowered the prosecutor’s burden of proof. We review\nthis claim of instructional error de novo, and conclude there was no error.\n       Defendant first argues that no conspiracy instructions should have been given,\nbecause the prosecutor made no prima facie showing of the existence of a conspiracy by\nindependent evidence. We have considered and rejected that claim in part 2, ante.\n       Next, defendant argues the conspiracy instructions were incomplete and\nmisleading. We see no merit in this claim either.\n       The court instructed the jury on uncharged conspiracy with CALJIC No. 6.10.5\n(defining the terms “conspiracy” and “overt act” and describing the elements necessary to\nfind defendant to be a member of a conspiracy).37 In addition, the court gave CALJIC\n\n\n37       The trial court instructed, based on CALJIC No. 6.10.5: “A conspiracy is an\nagreement between two or more persons with the specific intent to agree to commit the\ncrime of murder, and with the further specific intent to commit that crime, followed by an\novert act committed in this state by one or more of the parties for the purpose of\naccomplishing the object of the agreement. Conspiracy is a crime, but is not charged as\nsuch in this case. [¶] In order to find a defendant to be a member of a conspiracy, in\naddition to proof of the unlawful agreement and specific intent, there must be proof of the\ncommission of at least one overt act. It is not necessary to such a finding as to any\nparticular defendant that defendant personally committed the overt act, if he was one of\nthe conspirators when the alleged overt act was committed. [¶] The term ‘overt act’\nmeans any step taken or act committed by one or more of the conspirators which goes\nbeyond mere planning or agreement to commit a crime and which step or act is done in\nfurtherance of the accomplishment of the object of the conspiracy. [¶] To be an ‘overt\nact,’ the step taken or act committed need not, in and of itself, constitute the crime or\neven an attempt to commit the crime which is the ultimate object of the conspiracy. Nor\nis it required that the step or act, in and of itself, be a criminal or unlawful act.”\n\n                                            117\n\fNo. 6.12 (that proof of an express agreement is not necessary, and may be inferred from\nall circumstances tending to show the common intent),38 as well as CALJIC No. 6.11 (on\njoint responsibility of each member of a conspiracy for the acts of the other conspirators)\nand CALJIC No. 6.14 (that acquaintance with all coconspirators is not necessary).39\n       Defendant argues that the trial court also should have instructed with CALJIC\nNo. 6.22. That instruction says that each defendant in a conspiracy case is individually\nentitled to a determination whether he or she was a member of the conspiracy, and that\nthe jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was a conspiracy to commit the\ncrime, that a defendant “willfully, intentionally and knowingly” joined with others in the\nconspiracy, and that one of them committed an overt act.40 Defendant argues that, by\nincluding CALJIC No. 6.12 (that proof of an express agreement is not necessary), but\n\n\n38     Under CALJIC No. 6.12, the court instructed: “The formation and existence of a\nconspiracy may be inferred from all circumstances tending to show the common intent\nand may be proved in the same way as any other fact may be proved, either by direct\ntestimony of the fact or by circumstantial evidence, or by both direct and circumstantial\nevidence. It is not necessary to show a meeting of the alleged conspirators or the making\nof an express or formal agreement.”\n39     In the trial court, defendant argued that CALJIC No. 6.10.5 (defining conspiracy\nand overt acts) was the only conspiracy instruction that should be given in an uncharged\nconspiracy case.\n\n40     CALJIC No. 6.22 – entitled “conspiracy – case must be considered as to each\ndefendant” – states: “Each defendant in this case is individually entitled to, and must\nreceive, your determination whether [he] [she] was a member of the alleged conspiracy.\nAs to each defendant you must determine whether [he] [she] was a conspirator by\ndeciding whether [he] [she] willfully, intentionally and knowingly joined with any other\nor others in the alleged conspiracy. [¶] Before you may return a guilty verdict as to any\ndefendant of the crime of conspiracy, you must unanimously agree and find beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that (1) there was a conspiracy to commit the crime[s] of , and (2) a\ndefendant willfully, intentionally and knowingly joined with any other or others in the\nalleged conspiracy. You must also unanimously agree and find beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, that an overt act was committed by one of the conspirators. You are not required\nto unanimously agree as to who committed an overt act, or which overt act was\ncommitted, so long as each of you finds beyond a reasonable doubt, that one of the\nconspirators committed one of the acts alleged in the [information] [indictment] to be\novert acts.”\n\n                                            118\n\ffailing also to instruct with CALJIC No. 6.22, the court “did not make clear for the jury\nthat a conspiratorial agreement must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,” and thus\n“misled” the jurors.41 Defendant also asserts that CALJIC No. 17.00 – instructing the\njury to “decide separately whether each of the defendants is guilty or not guilty” (italics\nadded) – should have been given. Defendant is mistaken.First, defendant did not request\nthe court to instruct with CALJIC Nos. 6.22 and 17.00 (or CALJIC No. 6.18).42 “To the\nextent defendant’s claim is that the court failed to give clarifying or amplifying\ninstructions, the claim is waived because defendant did not request such clarification\nbelow.” (People v. Jenkins (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195356/people-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1020.)\n       Second, CALJIC No. 6.22 by its plain terms is intended for use in a case where\nmultiple defendants are charged with the crime of conspiracy (and CALJIC No. 17.00 is\nlikewise for use in a multiple-defendant case). This case involves neither multiple\ndefendants nor a conspiracy charge. A trial court has no sua sponte duty to give an\ninstruction that does not apply to the case.\n       Third, there is in any event no merit to the claim that the instructions as given\nsomehow “lowered the prosecutor’s burden of proof.” “It is well established in\nCalifornia that the correctness of jury instructions is to be determined from the entire\ncharge of the court, not from a consideration of parts of an instruction or from a particular\ninstruction.” (People v.

The jury was instructed that defendant was\npresumed to be innocent and the People had “the burden of proving [defendant] guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” (CALJIC No. 2.90.) The jury was instructed that the\nburden was “on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is the\nperson who committed the crime with which he is charged.” (CALJIC No. 2.91.)\n       In short, it is quite clear that, “[c]onsidered as a whole, the instructions did not\nreduce the prosecution’s burden of proof.” (People v. Williams, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 711.) There was no error.\n13. The Jury Instruction on Eyewitness Identification\n       Defendant argues the trial court violated his state and federal due process rights\nwhen it instructed the jury that it could consider a witness’s level of certainty when\nevaluating an eyewitness’s identification. We disagree.\n       The court instructed the jury, without objection, with a modified version of\nCALJIC No. 2.92, as follows: “Eyewitness testimony has been received in this trial. In\ndetermining the weight to be given eyewitness identification testimony, you should\nconsider the believability of the eyewitness as well as other factors which bear upon the\n\n                                             120\n\faccuracy of the witness’ identification of the defendant, including, but not limited to, any\nof the following: [¶] . . . [¶] The extent to which the witness is either certain or\nuncertain of the identification . . . .” The instruction also listed a dozen other factors the\njury should consider, including the length of time between the act and the identification,\nwhether the identification is in fact the product of the witness’s own recollection, and so\non.43\n        The witness’s certainty or uncertainty has long been used as a factor in evaluating\neyewitness identifications, and its use does not violate due process.

(People v. Johnson (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1205096\"><a href=\"/opinion/1205096/people-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1230-1231 (Johnson) [“CALJIC\nNo. 2.92 normally provides sufficient guidance on the subject of eyewitness\nidentification factors”].) Johnson rejected a claim of trial court error in instructing the\njury on the certainty factor. (Id. at pp. 1231-1232 [the defendant contended there was no\nevidence to support the instruction because an expert testified, without contradiction, that\na witness’s confidence in an identification does not positively correlate with its accuracy;\nthe court concluded the trial court “did not err . . . in instructing the jury on the ‘certainty’\nfactor”].) Johnson also cited the certainty factor when it restated “the principles that\ndetermine whether the admission of identification evidence violates a defendant’s right to\ndue process.” (Id. at p. 1216.) The court said that “[c]onstitutional reliability . . .\ndepends on (1) whether the identification procedure was unduly suggestive and\nunnecessary [citing Manson]; and, if so, (2) whether the identification itself was\nnevertheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances, taking into account such\nfactors as the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\nwitness’s degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the\nlevel of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and\nthe confrontation. [Citation.] ‘If, and only if, the answer to the first question is yes and\nthe answer to the second is no, is the identification constitutionally unreliable.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       In the face of this solid body of law, defendant nonetheless argues the instruction\nviolated his right to due process, because “[s]ubsequent research . . . has shown the\n\n\n\n                                              122\n\fcertainty with which the witness makes the identification has little correlation with the\naccuracy of that identification.” The argument fails.\n       First, defendant did not object to the instruction; indeed, CALJIC NO. 2.92\nappears on defendant’s list of requested instructions. When an instruction is a correct\nstatement of the law and the defendant claims it should have been modified, “his failure\nto seek such modification forfeits the claim.” (People v. Richardson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\npp. 1022-1023 [“while the court may review unobjected-to instruction that allegedly\nimplicates defendant’s substantial rights, claim that instruction, correct in law, should\nhave been modified ‘is not cognizable, however, because defendant was obligated to\nrequest clarification and failed to do so,’ ” quoting People v. Guerra, supra, 37 Cal.4th at\np. 1134].)\n       Second, we cannot in any event find a due process violation. Defendant relies\nonly on authorities from other jurisdictions, such as Brodes v. State (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1353360\"><a href=\"/opinion/1353360/brodes-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nThere, the court held (over a dissent) that, because of studies showing no correlation\nbetween certainty and accuracy, “we can no longer endorse an instruction authorizing\njurors to consider the witness’s certainty in his/her identification as a factor to be used in\ndeciding the reliability of that identification.” (Id. at p. 440.) But cases from other\njurisdictions do not assist defendant, as we are bound by the decisions of our Supreme\nCourt and the high court and, as we have seen, their directions are clear.\n       We cannot end without noting that “the jury, not the judge, traditionally\ndetermines the reliability of evidence,” and there are “other safeguards built into our\nadversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness\ntestimony of questionable reliability.” (Perry v. New Hampshire, supra, 132 S.Ct. at\np. 728.) These safeguards include counsel who “can expose the flaws in the eyewitness’\ntestimony during cross-examination and focus the jury’s attention on the fallibility of\nsuch testimony during opening and closing arguments” (ibid.), as well as expert\ntestimony – both of which safeguards were well employed in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                             123\n\f14. The Flight Instruction\n       The defense objected to the prosecution’s request for an instruction on flight after\ncrime (CALJIC No. 2.52), and requested that, if the instruction were given over the\nobjection, it should be modified. The trial court agreed with the requested modification,\nand instructed the jury as follows: “The flight of a person after the commission of a\ncrime, or after he is accused of a crime, is not sufficient in itself to establish his guilt, but\nis a fact which, if proved, may be considered by you in light of all other proved facts in\ndeciding whether a defendant is guilty or not guilty. Whether or not evidence of flight\nshows a consciousness of guilt and the significance to be attached to such a circumstance,\nare matters for your determination.”\n       Defendant contends it was error to give the flight instruction. We disagree.\n       a. The evidence\n       Karen Dragutin testified (see pt. 2.h. of the facts, ante) to threatening statements\ndefendant made about Mickey Thompson during a dinner conversation in the months\npreceding the murders. These included that “the only way he [defendant] was going to\nget out of it [(the litigation mess)] is if Mickey Thompson died.” Ms. Dragutin said\ndefendant “was talking about a boat and going to Bermuda, and it was still in the context\nof that conversation. So my conclusion was he was going away.”\n       The facts relating to the yacht are recounted in part 5, ante, of the factual\nsummary. In short, defendant’s wife made a deposit for the purchase of a yacht in\nJanuary 1988, received approval of a bank loan for the yacht on March 9, 1988, and\nconsummated the sale in late April or early May. On June 27, 1988, defendant took the\n57-foot yacht, which was outfitted such that two people could live on it for an extended\nperiod of time, to a South Carolina marina for installation of equipment, and the yacht\nwas there for six weeks. In early August, defendant unexpectedly asked the marina\nmanager to expedite the work; the manager did so, and defendant sailed away. In\nMay 1991, the bank holding the mortgage on the yacht hired a boat surveyor to repossess\nthe yacht, and during his efforts to do so, defendant told him by telephone that “he would\n\n\n\n                                               124\n\fnever find his boat.” The surveyor ultimately located the yacht and defendant in\nGuatemala.\n       Detective Griggs testified that he never caused a case to be filed against defendant,\nnever arrested him, and at no time sought to arrest him and could not find him.\n       b. The law\n       “[Penal Code] [s]ection 1127c requires a trial court in any criminal proceeding to\ninstruct as to flight where evidence of flight is relied upon as tending to show guilt.”44\n(People v.

CALJIC No. 2.52 is derived\nfrom section 1127c.

The weight to which such circumstance is\nentitled is a matter for the jury to determine. [¶] No further instruction on the subject of\nflight need be given.”\n\n\n                                             125\n\fpossession of a vehicle belonging to the murder victim when he was arrested in Arizona,\nthe flight instruction “plainly was warranted”].) “[A] flight instruction does not create an\nunconstitutional permissive inference or lessen the prosecutor’s burden of proof, and is\nproper even when identity is at issue.” (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 710.)\n       c. Contentions and conclusions\n       Defendant first contends the flight instruction “improperly focused the jury’s\nattention on ‘flight’ evidence where little evidence connected [defendant] to the killings.”\nDefendant’s premise – that little evidence connected him to the crimes – is unsound, and\nthe only authority he cites is not California authority. In California, the flight instruction\nis proper if “ ‘the evidence shows that the defendant departed the crime scene under\ncircumstances suggesting that his movement was motivated by a consciousness of guilt’ ”\n(Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 710), and that is the only pertinent question. The evidence\nwe have described above – relating to the purchase of the yacht, its outfitting, and\ndefendant’s subsequent sailing to parts unknown, along with his statements before the\nmurders “about a boat and going to Bermuda,” in the context of other statements that “the\nonly way he was going to get out of it [(the litigation mess)] is if Mickey Thompson\ndied” – permits the inference that defendant left Los Angeles “ ‘under circumstances\nsuggesting that his movement was motivated by a consciousness of guilt.’ ” (Ibid.)\n       Next, defendant says the instruction was defective because it omitted the word\n“immediate,” which appears in Penal Code section 1127c, and because defendant had not\nbeen accused of the murders when he “went sailing.” There was no defect. The statutory\nlanguage includes the flight of a person both “immediately after the commission of a\ncrime” and “after he is accused of a crime that has been committed . . . .” (§ 1127c.) As\ndefense counsel told the trial court in seeking dismissal of the case, defendant “was a\nnamed suspect within hours of the murder.” And, in any event, CALJIC No. 2.52\n“neither requires knowledge on a defendant’s part that criminal charges have been filed,\nnor a defined temporal period within which the flight must be commenced . . . .” (Carter,\nsupra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1182.)\n\n\n\n                                             126\n\f       Finally, defendant contends the instruction was erroneous because the court\nexcluded evidence that defendant had, through counsel, “offered to make himself\navailable in Los Angeles should his presence be required by investigators – a fact\nvitiating an inference [defendant] ‘fled’ to avoid arrest.” This contention has no merit\neither. First, defendant offers no argument or legal authority to suggest the court’s\nevidentiary ruling was erroneous, and so we need not consider the point. (People v.\nStanley (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213708/people-v-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793.) Second, there was in any event no error in the\nevidentiary ruling. Defendant is referring to a letter from then-defense counsel Al Stokke\nto Detective Griggs in October 1988, apparently offering to make defendant available in\nLos Angeles if needed. But Mr. Stokke had told police, just a few hours after the\nmurders, and again at a later meeting among Detective Griggs, defendant and Mr. Stokke,\nthat defendant would not make any statement. The trial court ruled that if the defense\nadduced the statement from Mr. Stokke’s letter, the prosecutor could bring out\nMr. Stokke’s previous statement that defendant would not talk to the police; otherwise\nthe jury would be misled into inferring that defendant was cooperating with the police.\nDefense counsel then apparently chose not to adduce the letter or any testimony about it.\nThere was no error in the trial court’s ruling.45\n       Defendant repeatedly contends the flight instruction provided the jury with an\nimproper basis from which to infer defendant “had a culpable mental state at the time of\nthe offense.” But the Supreme Court has repeatedly held otherwise.

Flight\nrequires “ ‘ “a purpose to avoid being observed or arrested” ’ ” (Avila, supra, 46 Cal.4th\nat p. 710), and the evidence we have described easily permits that factual determination.\n(See Abilez, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 522 [“ ‘the instruction did not assume that flight was\nestablished, leaving that factual determination and its significance to the jury’ ”];\ncf. Carter, supra, 36 Cal.4th at pp. 1182-1183 [“even if we were to conclude the\ninstruction should not have been given, any error would have been harmless.

The Prosecutorial Misconduct Claims\n         Defendant contends the prosecutor committed numerous acts of prosecutorial\nmisconduct. We do not agree.\n         The Supreme Court has summarized the standards under which we evaluate a\nclaim of prosecutorial misconduct. “A prosecutor’s conduct violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution when it infects the trial with such unfairness as to\nmake the conviction a denial of due process. Conduct by a prosecutor that does not\nrender a criminal trial fundamentally unfair is prosecutorial misconduct under state law\nonly if it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade\neither the trial court or the jury.” (People v. Morales (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629809\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629809/people-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44\n(Morales).)\n         “ ‘ “ ‘[A] prosecutor is given wide latitude during argument.

When a prosecutorial\nmisconduct claim focuses on comments the prosecutor made before the jury, “the\n\n                                              128\n\fquestion is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any\nof the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.” (Morales, supra, 25 Cal.4th\nat p. 44.)\n       The defendant may not complain on appeal of the prosecutor’s misconduct unless\nhe timely objected at trial “and also requested that the jury be admonished to disregard\nthe perceived impropriety.” (People v.

If the\ndefendant objected, or if an objection would not have cured the harm, we ask whether the\nimproper conduct was prejudicial, that is, whether it is reasonably probable a result more\nfavorable to the defendant would have occurred if the prosecutor had refrained from the\nmisconduct.

Claims of misconduct in the prosecutor’s opening statement\n       Defendant contends the prosecutor made “numerous bad faith and prejudicial\nstatements” during his opening statement, “promising evidence he failed to produce.” As\nwe address defendant’s often hyperbolic (and sometimes misleading) claims, it is well to\nbear in mind the applicable principles.\n       It is, of course, improper “to make assertions of fact in an opening statement that\nthe prosecutor cannot prove and does not intend to prove . . . .” (5 Witkin, Cal. Criminal\nLaw (4th ed. 2012) Criminal Trial, § 621, p. 963.) “But mere failure to prove every point\nasserted does not amount to prejudicial misconduct,” and “[m]ere discrepancy between\nstatement and proof is not reversible error.” (Ibid.) “[R]emarks made in an opening\nstatement cannot be charged as misconduct unless the evidence referred to by the\nprosecutor ‘was “so patently inadmissible as to charge the prosecutor with knowledge\nthat it could never be admitted.” ’ [Citation.]” (People v. Wrest (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1190343\"><a href=\"/opinion/1190343/people-v-wrest/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1108 (Wrest).) And misconduct in an opening statement “is not grounds for reversal of\nthe judgment on appeal unless the misconduct was prejudicial or the conduct of the\nprosecutor so egregious as to deny the defendant a fair trial.” (People v. Harris (1989)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1247795\"><a href=\"/opinion/1247795/people-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1080.)\n\n                                            129\n\f        In this case, we see no misconduct. As was true in Wrest, “in each case, the\nvariance between prosecutorial statement and actual proof is minor or nonexistent. In no\ncase can an inference of misconduct be drawn.” (Wrest, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 1108.)\n        Defendant cites nine instances of alleged misconduct in the prosecutor’s opening\nstatement.\n               i. The first three claims of misconduct\n        Defendant’s first three claims of misconduct are based on the following portion of\nthe prosecutor’s opening statement. The prosecutor referred to Allison Triarsi and her\nparents, Phyllis and Anthony Triarsi, neighbors who could look down on the crime scene\narea, and said:\n        “And what they will tell you is that after a volley of several gunshots had been\nlevied, presumably against Mickey Thompson – because of the autopsy findings, it’s\npresumable that Mickey Thompson was shot multiple times before the coup d’ gras [sic]\nshot.\n        “As a matter of fact, the evidence will show that’s exactly what happened based\non the witness’s observations. As he stood at the top of the driveway, the other gunman\nshot at the van. The van had several bullet holes in it. Trudy Thompson was either\npulled from or fell out of the van. She then got down to her knees.\n        “The injuries that she sustained indicate the following: she was crawling down the\ndriveway. It is a very, very steep driveway. She was crawling down that driveway for\nher life. All of her acrylic fingernails began breaking off. She was skinning and scraping\nher knees. She was in a dress that day.\n        “The second gunman followed Trudy Thompson all the way down the driveway;\ngun in hand covering her; but he didn’t kill her yet. That will become incredibly\nimportant in this trial. He didn’t kill her yet. Mickey Thompson, though shot several\ntimes – Mickey Thompson ultimately suffered seven separate gunshot wounds.\nSeven. . . .\n        “And he was shot several times in the abdomen; in the hips; in the buttocks;\nthrough the arm. But he was kept alive. And the evidence will show that at any point at\n\n                                            130\n\fany time either of the gunmen could have put Mickey Thompson down like that, one shot\nto the head would do it. But they didn’t. He was disabled, but he was kept alive.\n        “Meanwhile Trudy Thompson was being covered by the other gunman. And once\nthey were in a position that they could see each other and Mickey Thompson could\nclearly watch, the second gunman put the gun to the back of Trudy’s head and fired a\nbullet through her brain. The evidence will show that Mickey Thompson’s last vision on\nthis planet was that of his wife being executed.\n        “[T]he second gunman then screwed that .9 millimeter pistol into the left ear of\nMickey Thompson, literally his left ear and fired a bullet that passed completely through\nhis brain and he was killed. Witnesses saw this, then watched as the gunman jumped on\nbicycles and began to pedal off. . . . ”\n        Based on that opening statement, defendant complains (1) that Phyllis and\nAnthony Triarsi did not testify at trial, and that no witness testified to “[the prosecutor’s]\n‘dance of death.’ ” He also asserts (2) the prosecutor “failed to present any evidence that\n‘Trudy died first’ or the shooter held her head up by her hair before shooting her.” And\nhe contends (3) there was no evidence a gun was “screwed into [Mickey Thompson’s]\nleft ear,” or that he “was shot to incapacitate him but kept alive so he could watch Trudy\ndie.”\n        First, we do not see misconduct in the prosecutor’s mention of Allison Triarsi’s\nparents as anticipated eyewitnesses, along with Miss Triarsi. Nor can we see what\npossible prejudice could flow from a prosecutorial decision to produce only one witness\ninstead of three. And, contrary to defendant’s assertions, the prosecutor said nothing\nabout a “dance of death” in his opening statement.\n        Second, the prosecutor at no point suggested in his argument that “the shooter held\n[Trudy’s] head up by her hair before shooting her.” Defendant’s insinuation that the\nprosecutor said this is incorrect.46\n\n46     Defense counsel, in cross-examination of Lance Johnson, elicited his testimony\nabout this scenario in order to show the witness’s bias. Mr. Johnson admitted that he had\nparticipated in various television shows recreating the crime, and even though he did not\n\n                                             131\n\f       Third, Allison Triarsi’s testimony was substantially consistent with the\nprosecutor’s argument that Mickey Thompson was kept alive to watch his wife die. As\nmore fully described in part 4.a. of the facts, ante, Miss Triarsi testified there was a man\nwith Mickey Thompson who “had a gun and was directing him and making him go in\ncertain directions”; she heard Mickey Thompson saying, over and over, “Please don’t kill\nmy wife,” a statement directed to another man “at the bottom of the driveway who had a\ngun and coming towards Trudy”; it appeared Mickey Thompson was trying to go to his\nwife, and the gunman was “hold[ing] him at bay with an outstretched hand with the gun\nin his hand”; and then the gunman near Trudy shot her in the head. Miss Triarsi testified\nthat she did not remember what the gunman who shot Trudy did next, “because the next\nthing I remember Mickey is getting shot.” This is plainly evidence that “Trudy died\nfirst.” (And, the medical examiner, Dr. Lisa Scheinin, indicated the gunshot wound to\nMr. Thompson’s head was most likely the last of the wounds inflicted on him.)\n       Fourth, as for the prosecutor’s statements that the gunman “screwed that\n.9 millimeter pistol into his left ear and fired a shot through Mickey’s brain,” respondent\nacknowledges this was an overstatement. As Dr. Scheinin testified, there was\n“absolutely” no evidence that anyone “screwed a gun in to [Mickey Thompson’s] ear and\nfired a bullet.” But Dr. Scheinin also testified that the gunshot wound was “consistent\nwith someone putting a weapon close within inches behind Mr. Thompson’s ear and\nfiring it.” We consider this inconsistency between the prosecutor’s opening statement\nand the evidence actually adduced to be inconsequential.

Dykes (2009)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 761-762 [“the evidence may not have established that the victim died\nlooking at his grandmother, but there was evidence that could support the view that the\nchild was leaning toward his grandmother when he was shot”; any inconsistency was\n\n\n\nwitness the murders, he told the producers on camera that his understanding of how the\ncrime occurred was that Trudy Thompson’s head was held up by the hair, so that Mickey\nThompson could see the killers shoot her in the head, after which they shot\nMr. Thompson.\n\n\n                                             132\n\finconsequential]; cf. Harris, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 1079 [“We reject what appears to be\nan attempt to elevate hyperbole into misconduct.”].)\n       Finally, in his reply brief, defendant claims respondent conceded misconduct by\nfailing to address a claim he made in his opening brief (in connection with his argument\nthat “nobody testified to [the prosecutor’s] ‘dance of death’ ”). Defendant asserted,\nwithout elaboration, that “[n]o witness testified” to the following statement of the\nprosecutor (made while showing photographs of the crime scene and arguing this was a\nprofessional hit, not a robbery, and that the Thompsons could see each other): “All the\nblood Mickey Thompson was losing at the top of the driveway will suggest that he was\ncrawling in circles in this area (indicating),” and “ultimately was shot to death right\nwhere the white sheet is.” Defendant does not explain how this is in any way significant,\nand again, any inconsistency with the evidence is inconsequential. There was no\nmisconduct.\n              ii. The bankruptcy fraud claim\n       In his opening statement, the prosecutor explained that, after defendant declared\nbankruptcy, Mr. Thompson was the most aggressive of defendant’s creditors, and as a\ncreditor he had two options. The prosecutor continued:\n              “And these are important options to understand . . . . [¶] . . .\n       Option 1, pay me what you owe me. That’s all I ask for. You can do\n       whatever you want to with the rest of the creditors. But pay me what you\n       owe me and then go on about your business. . . . [¶] Option 2, pay me\n       what you owe me. And I’m going to show the bankruptcy court that you\n       have engaged in fraud, deceit, lying on the court, and the bankruptcy court\n       won’t discharge any of your debt. [¶] Guess which one Mickey chose?\n       Option 2. That was the objection that Mickey filed with the bankruptcy\n       court. That case was supposed to go to trial on March 18th. Mickey\n       Thompson was killed two days beforehand.”\n       Defendant contends this argument was misconduct because “[t]he prosecutor\nfailed to prove [defendant] committed bankruptcy fraud.” The short answer to this claim\nis that the prosecutor did not say he would prove defendant committed bankruptcy fraud;\nhe said that Mr. Thompson intended to offer proof to the bankruptcy court that defendant\nhad engaged in fraud. And the prosecution presented considerable evidence of\n\n                                            133\n\fdefendant’s improper actions during the bankruptcy. For example, and as more fully\ndescribed in part 1 of the facts, ante, when Jeffrey Coyne was appointed bankruptcy\ntrustee, he discovered “there was no operating company to run,” as “the operating part”\nhad been sold to a company owned and operated by defendant’s wife and another person.\nMr. Coyne found “lots of gaping holes” and determined that the transfer “was all done for\nthe purpose of moving the business without paying the creditors,” the most vocal of\nwhom was Mr. Thompson. Mr. Coyne testified to his belief the activity of defendant, his\nwife, and the entities in the transaction was fraud affecting Mr. Thompson’s rights as a\ncreditor.\n       In short, while defendant was not convicted of bankruptcy fraud – he was\nconvicted of filing false loan documents, a fact never published to the jury – the\nprosecutor did not say otherwise, and there is obviously no misconduct.\n              iii. Deputy John Williams\n       Defendant next cites as misconduct this part of the prosecutor’s opening\nstatement:\n       “I told you about that prized Mercedes, that 1982 SL coupe. Mickey Thompson\nwent after that as a personal asset. It was ultimately seized by authorities. We will\nintroduce you to Deputy John Williams who is now a public official in Orange County;\nno longer a serving officer. But he is a serving public official, an elected official.\n       “He will tell you that when he walked up to notify [defendant] that he was going\nto have to seize his car, he had legal documentation that entitled him, John Williams, to\nseize the car, [defendant] flew into one of his famous violent rages. He flew into a rage.\nHe turned beet red. His neck got thick. Every vein on his face started sticking out. And\nhe screamed, ‘He doesn’t know who he’s fucking with. He’s fucking dead . . . if he\nthinks he’s going to take my car. The car was, in fact, taken.”\n       Defendant cites this as misconduct, saying the prosecutor “failed to prove\n[defendant] made threats in the presence of Deputy John Williams.” He is wrong.\nMr. Williams testified just as the prosecutor said he would. But he also said his best\nrecollection was that the incident occurred in late 1987 or early 1988, while other\n\n                                             134\n\fwitnesses and documentation showed a levy occurred in June or July 1986. Defendant\nsays Mr. Williams’s testimony was “false” because defendant was in bankruptcy since\nthe fall of 1986, so the car could not have been seized in 1987 or 1988 to satisfy\nMr. Thompson’s judgment. But mistaken testimony is not “false” testimony. (Indeed,\nMr. Williams was adamant, even when confronted with evidence that a levy occurred in\n1986, that the incident he described “did not occur in August of 1986,” and that he was\n“never told, even by the defendant, he was in bankruptcy or I wouldn’t have taken his\ncar.”) There is simply no support for defendant’s assertion that the prosecutor “failed to\nprove [defendant] made threats in the presence of Deputy John Williams,” much less that\nthe prosecutor’s opening statement was “knowingly false and made in bad faith” and a\n“deliberate misstatement.” There was no misconduct.\n              iv. Allegedly false promises of testimony\n       Next, defendant makes several claims that the prosecutor “falsely promised”\ntestimony or evidence that was not presented.\n       First, defendant again returns to the prosecutor’s statement (see pt. i, ante) about\nthe bullet through Mickey Thompson’s brain, killing him. The prosecutor continued:\n“Witnesses that saw this, then watched as the gunman [sic] jumped on bicycles and began\nto pedal off.” Defendant complains that “[n]obody testified to seeing the gunmen jump\non bicycles and pedal off.” That is true, but inconsequential. Witnesses heard the\ngunfire, and just after that Lance Johnson saw two men on bicycles riding down the\nThompson driveway towards Woodlyn Lane. And Allison Triarsi heard the clicking of\nthe bicycles, “[l]ike a ten speed bike,” moving the back way out of the Thompson\nproperty. Plainly, “the variance between prosecutorial statement and actual proof is\nminor” and an inference of misconduct cannot be drawn. (Wrest, supra, 3 Cal.4th at\np. 1108.)\n       Next, defendant asserts the prosecutor “falsely promised” the evidence would\nshow defendant planned the murders, “but no such evidence was presented.” This is a\nfrivolous contention as to which defendant does not elaborate, and we do not consider it\nfurther.\n\n                                            135\n\f       Defendant also asserts misconduct in the final lines of the prosecutor’s opening\nstatement, where the prosecutor said: “He [(defendant)] would see that Mickey\nThompson was killed before he ever got a dime of his [(defendant’s)] money. And how\ndo we know that? Because we got it from the absolute, most reliable source.\n[Defendant] said so.” This is misconduct, defendant says, because “no confession was\npresented to the jury.” This claim is nonsense. The prosecutor did not claim that\ndefendant confessed. The prosecutor presented testimony from Gregory Keay that\ndefendant said “Mickey was out to get all of his money and before that would happen, he\nwould have him wasted.” And Joel Weissler testified that he heard defendant tell\nMr. Thompson, “You will never see a cent of it. I’m going to hurt you and your family.”\nThat is just what the prosecutor said, and defendant’s claim to the contrary is\ndisingenuous at best.\n       Finally, defendant asserts misconduct in the prosecutor’s statement that: “And\nthrough this whole thing every single witness, every witness who heard anything, from\nthe Johnsons to the Hackmans to the Triarsis, every witness that heard anything heard the\nsame thing from Mickey Thompson. . . . Mickey Thompson repeated over and over,\n‘Please, please don’t hurt my wife.’ ” Defendant points out that the Hackmans did not\ntestify, and neither did the Triarsi parents. Again, this is inconsequential. Three of the\nwitnesses mentioned did testify, and they all said what the prosecutor said they would\nsay. As noted above, we do not see misconduct in the mention of anticipated witnesses\nwho are not produced, when other witnesses provide the promised testimony. There was\nno misconduct.\n              v. Ronald Stevens’s photo identification\n       In his opening statement, the prosecutor talked about Ronald and Tonyia Stevens\nseeing defendant outside their home and their report of that incident to the police years\nlater. The prosecutor continued: “Ron Stevens was asked if he would look at a series of\nphotographs first. He said, sure, I’ll look at a series of photographs and see if I can\nidentify the person. He looked at the photographs and he pointed to a particular picture.”\n\n\n\n                                             136\n\f       Defendant contends this was misconduct, because the prosecutor “knew at the\ntime he made this statement it was false because he possessed a recording of that\nidentification procedure, during which Ron indicated he was unable to narrow his choice\ndown to fewer than three men . . . .”\n       We cannot find misconduct on this record. Mr. Stevens testified that when he was\nshown the photographs, he “was asked if [he] recognized anyone in the picture as being\nthe person in that car,” and he said, “Yes, I did.” He said he recognized “No. 3, the top\nright corner,” and that was defendant. Mr. Stevens was then asked on cross-examination,\n“Do you recall . . . that you actually weren’t really able to draw it to No. 3, you actually\nnarrowed it down to three out of the six?” and he replied, “No, I don’t.” The defense\nthen played audio recordings in court of portions of the photographic identification\nprocedure. A transcript of the audio recording (defense exhs. Z-1 & AA-1) shows\nMr. Stevens saying, “[I]t was this color of hair but it was this type of nose, but was that\ntype of complexion. I couldn’t be positive,” and, “Well, these three look similar,” and\n“1, 5 and 3 . . . look similar.” Detective Lillienfeld then says, “Yeah, but the guy you saw\nin the wagon that day most resembles who in this photo array now?” Mr. Stevens replies,\n“Number 3 or . . . [¶] Oh, okay. [¶] 1, 5 or 3 would be – if I saw them in person.”\n       The prosecutor’s opening statement was completely consistent with Mr. Stevens’s\ntestimony and, while the transcript shows uncertainty (which is why, as defendant points\nout, Detective Lillienfeld suggested a live lineup), it apparently also shows defendant did\npoint to defendant’s photo. In any event, there could be “‘no conceivable prejudice’”\nwhere defendant was able to confront Mr. Stevens and challenge his testimony as\ndefendant did here. (See Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 762.)\n              vi. Assertions of false representations\n       Defendant next makes three claims of allegedly false assertions or promises in the\nopening statement.\n       First, in describing defendant’s financial actions shortly before the murders, the\nprosecutor said: “[Defendant] had been hiding a series of investments in his wife Diane’s\nname. You’ll see the name Diane Goodwin. But we will also introduce evidence that\n\n                                             137\n\fshows beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant] was doing that on purpose. Why? To\nhide his assets from Mickey Thompson; to hide those assets from the Bankruptcy Court;\nand to set in motion his escape plan when he killed Mickey. [¶] He sold Whitehawk\ninvestments. And then another investment Desert Investors was also in Diane Goodwin’s\nname. Within days of the first sale, he sold all of his interest in those, the second one. So\nwhat did he do with all this money?”\n       Defendant contends the prosecutor “falsely asserted ‘[defendant] sold Whitehawk\ninvestments,” because the evidence showed “Whitehawk was never sold.” This is\nanother completely inconsequential point. It is true the Whitehawk investment itself was\nnot “sold.” (Dolores Cordell testified it was a real estate investment and she sought to\nbring returns from that investment into the bankruptcy estate; she testified she was able to\nbring the Whitehawk asset into the estate because she showed “the investment itself . . .\nbelonged in the estate.”) But in substance, the prosecutor showed what he said he would\nshow: the Whitehawk investment was purchased with commingled funds of the\nGoodwins, but then distributions from the Whitehawk investment in 1988 were made in\nthe name of Diane Goodwin. The parties stipulated there was a check for $365,000\npayable to Diane Goodwin from J.G.A. Group dated May 6, 1988, containing the\nnotation, “distribution from Whitehawk cashier’s check.” And Karen Stephens-Kingdon\ntestified that $300,000 of that $365,000 was transferred to Diane Goodwin’s account in\nanother bank; some $275,000 of that money was used to purchase gold coins, and another\n$10,000 was wired offshore. That this money was from a distribution and not a sale is\nunimportant. There was no misconduct.\n       Second, defendant cites as misconduct the prosecutor’s use of the words\n“skimming” and “stolen” in his description of defendant’s actions that precipitated\nMickey Thompson’s lawsuit. The prosecutor described the inception of the dispute:\nMr. Thompson had to “front more cash and more cash” for the venture’s first racing\nevent, despite defendant’s obligation to furnish 70 percent of the capital. The prosecutor\ncontinued: “The evidence will show the reason Mickey Thompson was fronting all the\nmoney is because [defendant] was cheating him. He was [siphoning] money off the top;\n\n                                            138\n\fskimming money off the top of the company; and skimming money out of the pocket of\nMickey Thompson.” So Mr. Thompson sued him, and obtained a judgment of almost\n$800,000. The prosecutor said the judge found that in eight months of doing business\ntogether, defendant “had stolen over $500,000 – $512,000 to be exact – from Mickey\nThompson.”\n       Defendant cites testimony that the issues in the dispute were over defendant’s\nrefusal to advance cash to put on events and his plan that Mr. Thompson “would have no\nsay in, or revenue from, the operations,” and that there was an issue raised of contract\ninterpretation. These issues, defendant asserts, “do not amount to ‘skimming’ or\n‘stealing.’ ” Perhaps not, in a technical legal sense. But when one business partner\nrefuses to contribute his agreed 70 percent share, jeopardizing the racing event and thus\nforcing the other partner to put up the money (not to mention planning that\nMr. Thompson would have no revenues from the operation of their companies), it is hard\nnot to think of this conduct, in the colloquial sense, as stealing. The prosecutor’s\nlanguage was well within the “ ‘broad scope of permissible argument.’ ” (Dykes, supra,\n46 Cal.4th at p. 762 [rejecting contention that language in opening statement describing\nthe defendant in an unflattering light was misconduct; the comments “were based upon\nevidence to be presented at the trial . . . and were within the ‘broad scope of permissible\nargument’ ”].) (Defendant’s assertion in his reply brief that “Dykes was wrongly\ndecided” requires no comment from us.)\n       Third, defendant asserts misconduct in the prosecutor’s statement that “the\nevidence in this case will show that [defendant] was never ever, ever going to pay\nMickey Thompson what he owed him.” Defendant says the evidence showed that in the\nweeks before the murders, defendant’s and Mr. Thompson’s attorneys had worked out a\nsettlement, and defendant signed that settlement agreement after the Thompsons were\nmurdered. This, defendant says, makes the prosecutor’s statement “false[].” On the\ncontrary, the evidence presented reasonably could be viewed just as the prosecutor said.\nDolores Cordell testified that defendant repeatedly expressed his willingness to accept\nsettlement terms, only to renege at the last minute. The testimony defendant\n\n                                            139\n\fcharacterizes as showing that the settlement “would have paid Thompson the entire\njudgment” actually was that the settlement said “basically that Mickey Thompson’s debt\nwould not be dischargeable in the bankruptcy.” Defendant signed the settlement after the\nmurders, and Phillip Bartinetti testified that “to this day” the judgment has never been\npaid by defendant. No misconduct is shown.\n              vii. The Insport agreement\n       As the prosecutor described it, the so-called “Insport agreement” was a contract\nthat gave the signatory the unique ability to put on motor sports races with certain drivers\nin certain venues. Defendant was a signatory to the Insport agreement, which was worth\n“tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars to the holder” of the\ncontract. In his opening statement, the prosecutor said: “In order to try to satisfy his\njudgment, Mickey Thompson went after the Insport agreement. [Defendant] fought it.\n[Defendant] lost.”\n       Defendant contends the last quoted statement was one of “numerous falsehoods”\nin the prosecutor’s opening statement. He tells us the evidence showed (1) the Insport\nagreement became an asset of the bankruptcy estate and was put up for bid; (2) Diane\nGoodwin and Charles Clayton were the highest bidders, not Mr. Thompson, (3) “so it\nwas not true that [defendant] ‘lost’ the Insport agreement to Thompson.” The first part of\ndefendant’s description of the evidence is correct, but his conclusion is incorrect.\n       The Goodwin/Clayton enterprise (SXI, of which defendant was president) was the\nhighest bidder for the Insport agreement, and purchased it with Bankruptcy Court\npermission. But SXI failed to make all the payments due to the Bankruptcy Court for the\nInsport agreement, and the trustee began taking steps to repossess it. Dolores Cordell\ntestified that in December 1987, there was a hearing, and the court “essentially put the\nInsport agreement up to bid again.” According to Ms. Cordell, several parties bid,\nincluding the Goodwins, and Mickey Thompson won that bid. Ms. Cordell’s recollection\nwas that he paid $500,000, in December 1987. (The trustee also testified that at no point\nduring his tenure as the bankruptcy trustee did defendant ever own the Insport agreement\n“free and clear.”) This evidence clearly supports the prosecutor’s statement that “Mickey\n\n                                            140\n\fThompson went after the Insport agreement,” and “[Defendant] fought it. [Defendant]\nlost.” Defendant’s claim that Ms. Cordell “had to admit she was wrong” is not borne out\nby the record. There was clearly no misconduct.\n      b. The claimed violation of a court order\n      Defendant sought to prevent the prosecutor from eliciting any testimony about\nbankruptcy fraud in connection with defendant’s conduct during the bankruptcy\nproceedings. (In federal proceedings, defendant had been charged with many counts of\nbankruptcy fraud and filing false loan documents, but was convicted only of filing false\nloan documents.) Thus, defendant objected to bankruptcy trustee Jeffrey Coyne\nexpressing any opinion about whether the transfer of assets from defendant’s company\n(ESI) to his wife’s enterprise (SXI) during the bankruptcy was fraudulent. The trial court\noverruled that objection, but ordered the prosecutor to “stay away from fraudulent\nactivity as separate criminal conduct.” Before Karen Stephens-Kingdon testified about\nthe Goodwins’ financial transactions, defense counsel again asserted there should be no\nreference to bankruptcy fraud, and the prosecutor agreed there would be no mention of\nbankruptcy fraud.\n      The prosecutor scrupulously complied with the court’s order. Nonetheless,\ndefendant asserts that the prosecutor “repeatedly used the words ‘fraud’ and ‘fraudulent’\nwhen questioning witnesses about the bankruptcy proceedings,” and says “[t]his was\nmisconduct.” In fact, defendant’s record citations for this claim of misconduct are\ncompletely devoid of any instance of the prosecutor’s use of the words “fraud” or\n“fraudulent.” The prosecutor used the word “fraud” once –in an instance not cited by\ndefendant – when he asked Mr. Bartinetti whether Mr. Thompson, when he objected to\ndefendant’s discharge in bankruptcy, was “claiming fraud and/or deceit on the part of\n[defendant].” (Defense counsel’s objection on grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation\nwas sustained.) Indeed, our review of the record shows the only reference by the\nwitnesses to “fraud” came from Mr. Coyne, when the prosecutor asked him how he\nwould describe “the activity between [defendant]; his wife Diane Goodwin; E.S.I.; S.X.I.;\nChuck Clayton; and the Insport agreement,” and Mr. Coyne answered, “I hate to use the\n\n                                           141\n\f‘F’ word, but fraud.”47 As noted above, this testimony (not cited by defendant) was\nspecifically permitted by the court. The witnesses properly testified to events that\noccurred during the bankruptcy proceedings and to defendant’s financial dealings.\n       In short, defendant’s claim that the prosecutor’s “obfuscation regarding ‘fraud’\nwas intended to confuse the jurors and convince them [defendant] had committed crimes\nin connection with the bankruptcies” has no basis whatsoever in the record.\n       c. The claim of prosecutorial misconduct by leading witnesses\n       Defendant contends the prosecutors “constantly engaged in leading” their\nwitnesses and asserts this was prejudicial misconduct. He cites some 100 objections over\nthe course of 20 days of trial testimony, about three quarters of which were sustained.\nDefendant also refers to several instances where the trial court cautioned the prosecutors\nabout leading questions, but refused to admonish the jury that this was prosecutorial\nmisconduct. Thus:\n       After the court sustained an objection to a leading question during the prosecutor’s\nexamination of Mr. Bartinetti, defense counsel asked the court to cite the prosecutor for\nmisconduct. The court replied: “Well, I have continued to sustain defense objections,”\nbut the court would “not cite anyone for misconduct right now, but simply admonish that\nthe People try to pose the questions in a nonleading fashion. And if it continues, we may\nget to that step, but we’re not anywhere close to that yet.” The court said, “the objections\nhave been I think well taken on the leading aspect of several witnesses already. And I, at\nthis point, just want the record to reflect that you are being asked to avoid leading\nquestions.” And later, still with Mr. Bartinetti, “Let’s stay away from leading questions,\nplease.”\n       During questioning of Dolores Cordell, after the court sustained an objection, the\nprosecutor asked for a sidebar. The court said to the prosecutor: “You know, there has\n\n\n47    There was another reference by Mr. Coyne to issues in a pleading in the\nbankruptcy court that included “avoidance of fraudulent transfers,” but this testimony\nwas specifically elicited by defense counsel, not the prosecutor.\n\n\n                                            142\n\fbeen a consistent problem with maybe your definition of leading and my definition of\nleading. I think a lot of these questions have been leading and that’s why I have been\nsustaining the objections. I denied the request for any kind of misconduct citation\nbecause I don’t believe this is intentional on your part. I think we have an honest\ndisagreement as to the form of the question.”\n       Later, at a sidebar on several subjects during Ronald Stevens’s testimony, the\ncourt denied defense counsel’s request to admonish the jury about improper leading\nquestions, “[f]or right now . . . .” The court refused a similar defense request during\nAllison Triarsi’s testimony. During Karen Stephens-Kingdon’s expert testimony, the\ncourt observed that “I’ve been troubled by the leading questions. I’m not saying that the\nleading questions are necessarily improper. But it’s difficult for me to understand exactly\nwhat you’re asking for if you’re supplying the information. [¶] I mean I would rather\nhear from the witness. The witness is clearly an expert. . . . [¶] I know I would feel\nmore comfortable and I think it would be more helpful if the questions were not so\nsuggestive and so leading.”\n       Based on these objections and the court’s rulings, defendant gives two examples\nof purportedly prejudicial leading questions on key issues in the case. One was a\nquestion to Ronald Stevens (who identified defendant as the man with binoculars in the\ncar outside his house a few days before the murders). Pointing to defendant, the\nprosecutor asked, “Would you describe [defendant’s] complexion as ruddy and pock\nmarked?” But before the prosecutor asked that leading question, he had already elicited\ntestimony from Mr. Stevens about defendant’s complexion. Mr. Stevens had testified\nthat he described the man to the police as “a big man with reddish colored hair and a\nruddy complexion.” In addition, the prosecutor had asked Mr. Stevens, “What did you\nmean when you said he had a ruddy complex [sic]?” Mr. Stevens answered, “It’s\nsomeone that has like pock marks or something when they were young and as they got\nolder it was just a ruddy type of complexion.” In short, the prosecutor’s subsequent\nquestion was leading, but it was not misconduct.\n\n\n\n                                            143\n\f       Defendant’s second example was a question to Allison Triarsi, after she had\ntestified that she was very familiar with the Thompson driveway: “From your\n[perspective] where you – from your view, I should say, was it your impression – being\nfamiliar with that driveway – that Mickey Thompson was in a position to see Trudy\nThompson?” Defense counsel objected and asked for a sidebar; no answer was given to\nthe question (and the court did not rule on the objection). At the sidebar, the court\nrefused to cite the prosecutor’s leading questions as prosecutorial misconduct and refused\nto admonish the jury, saying: “The jurors know that when I sustain the objection, that\nI’m finding that the question is improper. And they were preinstructed as to not to view\nthe question as evidence and not to speculate as to what the answer might be. I think that\nmessage has been made quite loud and clear because the objections have been continuing\nthroughout the trial. And they have all, just about, been sustained.” After the sidebar, the\nprosecutor asked Miss Triarsi about the view of a person standing in the driveway where\nMickey Thompson was, and she testified that “he could easily look down unobstructedly\nand see Trudy.” We do not see any misconduct – and certainly nothing prejudicial – in\nthe prosecutor’s original question.\n       Further, the only cases defendant cites to support his misconduct claim are cases\nthat say it is misconduct deliberately to elicit inadmissible and prejudicial testimony.\nThat did not happen in this case.

The claim of misconduct in closing argument\n       Defendant asserts there were six instances of prosecutorial misconduct in closing\nargument. Again we disagree.\n              i. The claim the prosecutor misstated the burden of proof\n       Defendant’s first claim of misconduct in closing argument is that the prosecutor\n“repeatedly misstated the burden of proof” by arguing “a ‘totality of the circumstances’\nburden of proof of a conspiracy, and as the standard for proving that [defendant]\nmurdered the Thompsons.” Defendant made no objection during the argument, but\nafterward asked the court to reread the reasonable doubt instruction, contending that the\nprosecutor implied that defendant “was responsible as if this were somehow a civil case.”\nWe find no misconduct, as the prosecutor’s argument, read as a whole, was both clear\nand correct on the burden of proof. (See People v. Dennis (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1111213\"><a href=\"/opinion/1111213/people-v-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522\n[“we must view the statements in the context of the argument as a whole”].)\n       In the challenged statements, the prosecutor was explaining the theories of liability\n(aiding and abetting and conspiracy). In discussing aiding and abetting, the prosecutor\nobserved that defendant “does not have to have been at the crime scene. As long as you\nare convinced that [defendant] is responsible in any way shape, form or fashion for the\nmurders of Mickey Thompson and Trudy Thompson, he is liable for everything that the\nactual killers did.” Then the prosecutor talked about conspiracy, telling the jury that\nconspiracy, though uncharged, was important, because every member of a conspiracy is\nliable for the conduct of the others. So “if you find that he was a conspirator, if you find\nthat he was responsible and there was some agreement to kill Mickey Thompson and\nTrudy Thompson,” then “it’s just as if” defendant shot them. The prosecutor continued:\n       “The formation in existence of a conspiracy can be proved through circumstantial\nevidence and the circumstances surrounding the totality of the evidence.\n       “In other words, you don’t have to dissect this case to figure out if there is a\nconspiracy to commit murder. You can look at the totality of the circumstances. As a\nmatter of fact, the jury instruction tells you to do exactly that. These two men, the two\nkillers were acting in concert with one another.\n\n                                             145\n\f       “It was well timed, well coordinated and almost perfectly executed. The killers\ngot away. You can infer from that, you have to infer from that the only reasonable\nexplanation is they were working together. These aren’t two people who happened upon\nthe same house at the same time and just happened to kill Mickey and Trudy Thompson.\n       “Everybody agrees these people were obviously working together. There was an\nagreement there. And if the totality of the circumstances suggest that Michael Goodwin\nis responsible for the killings of Mickey and Trudy Thompson, then Michael Goodwin is\na conspirator along with the two actual killers.”\n       After explaining it was not necessary to prove that defendant knew or met with the\nkillers, the prosecutor said, “As long as the totality of the circumstances proves that\n[defendant] was responsible for the murders of Mickey and Trudy Thompson, we don’t\nhave to show that he even knew the killers. As long as you agree and are convinced that\nthis was a concerted act on all parties.” Then the prosecutor explained that unanimity\nwas not necessary on the theory of liability, saying that some jurors could decide\ndefendant was an aider and abetter and others could say, “you know what, I’m absolutely\nconvinced there was a conspiracy and [defendant] was part of it.” And: “There does not\nhave to be unanimity among you with regard to the theory of liability as long as\neverybody is convinced that [defendant] is responsible for the murders of Mickey and\nTrudy Thompson . . . .”\n       Immediately following those remarks, the prosecutor said: “I want to say just a\ncouple of words about beyond a reasonable doubt. That’s the instruction that puts upon\nus the burden. And I will tell you right now, [defense counsel] and the defense team has\nno burden in this case. . . . [¶] [T]he system of justice . . . says that the prosecution bears\nthe entire burden of proof. And that burden is to prove the criminal case beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Every element of it. I accept that. I . . . embrace that. The defense\ndoesn’t have to prove anything.” The prosecutor then spoke about the meaning of\nreasonable doubt, and concluded: “So ask yourselves based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, do you have an abiding conviction that [defendant] is responsible in any\nway for the murders of Mickey Thompson and Trudy Thompson? If so, we’ve proved\n\n                                             146\n\fthis case to you to an abiding conviction, beyond a reasonable doubt.” The prosecutor\nalso told the jury that the case could be proved by circumstantial evidence, and that “as\nlong as you’re convinced through both circumstantial and direct evidence or one or the\nother that [defendant] is responsible for the deaths of Mickey and Trudy Thompson,\nthat’s all that’s required.”\n       After the argument was completed, defense counsel asked the court to reread the\nburden of proof instruction, and specifically to instruct the jury that “responsibility” is a\ncivil term, and “responsibility only plays a part in a civil hearing.” The court disagreed,\nexplaining that “the context of the argument was [defendant] wasn’t there. He was\nresponsible as an aider and abetter and a co-conspirator. And that’s how I think the jury\nwould interpret that comment.” The statement “was with reference to [vicarious] liability\nhere. And that is the essence of the prosecution’s case. I’m happy to reread the burden\nof proof instruction.”\n       It is apparent from the trial court’s comments and from a review of the entire\nargument – rather than the snippets quoted by defendant – that there was no misstatement\nof the burden of proof.\n               ii. Claims of improper exploitation of excluded evidence\n       Defendant asserts it was misconduct for the prosecutor to “exploit” the court’s\nexclusion of evidence of third party culpability and Joey Hunter’s polygraphs (see pts. 9\n& 11, ante) and the exclusion of evidence the killings were the result of a robbery gone\nbad (Mr. Thompson’s purchase of gold a few days before the murders) (see pt. 10, ante).\nDefendant asserts the two prosecutors devoted much of their closing arguments to the\nlack of evidence that anyone other than defendant hated Mr. Thompson enough to kill\nhim, and to the lack of evidence of a robbery.\n       Thus, for example, the prosecutor argued that “the only evidence you have heard\nin this trial” was evidence that pointed to “only one person who hated Mickey Thompson\nso much that he wanted to end his life. And make sure that Mickey Thompson saw the\nperson he loved the most die in front of him before he died. And that is [defendant].”\nAnd: “[T]here is really an important concept here as we talk about this. And that is,\n\n                                             147\n\fwhat is reasonable and what is unreasonable? What is evidence and what is speculation?\nWhen you hear someone say, well, you know, it could have been. It could have been a\nrobbery. There could have been a video camera there. They are asking you – [defense\ncounsel] is asking you to speculate as to what might have been. As to some evidence that\ndoesn’t exist. Could have been.” Defendant cites many other instances of similar\narguments in the prosecutor’s closing, and concludes that it was “nothing short of\noutrageous” for the prosecutor to “unfairly [take] advantage of the judge’s rulings.”\n       This claim of misconduct is without merit. First, the claim is forfeited because\ndefendant did not make any objection at trial. (Thornton, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 454.)\nSecond, the authorities defendant cites do not support his contention that, in effect, it is\nmisconduct for a prosecutor to argue his case based on the state of the evidence in the\nrecord.\n       Misconduct may occur if the court, at the prosecutor’s behest, erroneously\nexcludes evidence that should have been admitted, and the prosecutor knowingly lies to\nor otherwise misleads the jury. People v. Varona (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2115475\"><a href=\"/opinion/2115475/people-v-varona/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Varona)\ndemonstrates the point. In that case, the defendants, charged with rape and other crimes\nand defending based on the alleged victim’s consent, tried to introduce evidence that the\ncomplaining witness had earlier pled guilty to prostitution and was on probation at the\ntime of trial. The trial court excluded that evidence, and then the prosecutor argued to the\njury that there was no evidence the woman was a prostitute – even though he “knew he\nwas arguing a falsehood.” (Id. at pp. 569-570.) The Court of Appeal found it was error\nto exclude the evidence, and also agreed with the defendant’s contention “that it was\nmisconduct for the prosecutor to argue that there was no proof that the woman was a\nprostitute when he had, by his objections, prevented the defense from proving that fact.”\n(Id. at p. 569.) The court explained: “[I]n a proper case, a prosecutor may argue to a jury\nthat a defendant has not brought forth evidence to corroborate an essential part of his\ndefensive story. But we know of no case where such argument is permissible except\nwhere a defendant might reasonably be expected to produce such corroboration. Here the\nprosecutor not only argued the ‘lack’ of evidence where the defense was ready and\n\n                                             148\n\fwilling to produce it, but he compounded that tactic by actually arguing that the woman\nwas not a prostitute although he had seen the official records and knew that he was\narguing a falsehood. The whole argument went beyond the bounds of any acceptable\nconduct.” (Id. at p. 570.)\n       Similarly, in People v. Daggett (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2145290\"><a href=\"/opinion/2145290/people-v-daggett/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Daggett), the court\nerroneously excluded evidence that the child molestation victim (who himself had been\ncharged with molesting younger children) had reported previously being molested by\npersons other than defendant. The error “was compounded when the prosecutor argued\nto the jurors that if they believed [the victim] molested other children, he must have\nlearned that behavior from being molested by [the defendant].” (Id. at p. 757.) The\nerroneously excluded evidence was intended to refute that very argument, and the court\nfound the prosecutor misled the jury by making the argument and “unfairly took\nadvantage of the [court’s] ruling.” (Id. at p. 758.)\n       This case bears no similarity to the cited cases. This is not a case where the court\nexcluded evidence that should have been admitted. Nor did the prosecutor “argu[e] a\nfalsehood” or mislead the jury or unfairly take advantage of an erroneous ruling. The\nprosecutor properly argued his case, based on the state of the evidence in the record, that\nthis was a contract hit, not a robbery, and there was “only one person who hated Mickey\nThompson so much that he wanted to end his life.” There was no misconduct.

Claimed references to facts not in evidence\n       It is misconduct to refer in argument to “matter outside the record.” (People v.\nPinholster (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 948.) Defendant claims the prosecutor argued facts not\nin evidence when he said these things:\n       “Mickey Thompson stood on the top of the driveway and watched in horror as the\nlove of his life, Trudy Thompson, had a bullet put through the back of her head.”\n\n                                             149\n\f       “Mickey Thompson was executed on March 16th, 1988, at 6:05 in the morning,\nbut not before he had to watch his wife, his family, suffer and die. Exactly how\n[defendant] said he wanted it to happen. Exactly.”48\n       “[Defendant] lost the Insport agreement. [Defense counsel] might stand up and\nsay, well, there is no proof that Mickey Thompson got it. Who cares who got it. All we\ncare about is who lost it.

But\nDiane Goodwin’s interest in Whitehawk was really [defendant’s] interest in Whitehawk.\nHe had been hiding assets in her name or attempting to hide assets in her name and he\ndumped them all.”\n\n       This claim of misconduct, too, is without merit. Defendant made no objection to\nany of these statements at trial, so the claim is forfeited. (Thornton, supra, 41 Cal.4th at\np. 454.) In any event, these misconduct claims have no merit. They are essentially\nduplicates of points we have found to be without merit in connection with similar claims\nof misconduct in the prosecutor’s opening statement. (See our discussion in pt. 15.a.i.,\npt. 15.a.vi., and pt. 15.a.vii, ante.) The only different claim of misconduct is that, after\nsaying that Mr. Thompson had to watch his wife die, the prosecutor said: “Exactly how\n[defendant] said he wanted it to happen. Exactly.” Defendant points out that no one\ntestified to defendant’s making such a statement. Defendant is literally correct, in that\nthere is no evidence defendant said he wanted Mickey Thompson to watch his wife die.\nBut there was evidence defendant specifically said, on two different occasions, that he\nwas “going to hurt you and your family,” “I’ll get you. I’m going to hurt you,” and “I’m\ngoing to hurt your family.” In short, we consider the prosecutor’s remark fair comment\non the evidence, not misconduct. (People v.

Claimed misrepresentation of bankruptcy law\n       Defendant next cites as misconduct the prosecutor’s argument at pages 8783-8784\nof the trial transcript, saying that argument “misrepresented the law of bankruptcy” in\norder to make his case that defendant’s motive and intention was to avoid paying his civil\njudgment. In that part of the prosecutor’s argument – which defendant does not quote –\nthe prosecutor explained that, after the yacht loan was approved, and shortly after the\nmurders, the Goodwins’ house went into escrow; assets defendant had been trying to hide\nin his wife’s name were turned into cash; and cash was turned into gold and moved\noffshore.\n       First, no objection was made at trial, and the claim is forfeited. Second, we fail to\nsee how that argument “misstat[ed] the law of bankruptcy.” Defendant presents no\ncomprehensible argument or citation of authority for this point, so we do not consider it\nfurther. To the extent this is another version of defendant’s claim that the prosecutor\nviolated the court’s order to “stay away from fraudulent activity as separate criminal\nconduct,” or that there should be no mention of bankruptcy fraud in connection with\nKaren Stephens-Kingdon’s testimony, we have already found, in part 15.b., ante, that the\nprosecutor fully complied with the order.\n              v. Vouching for witnesses\n       The prosecutor “is generally precluded from vouching for the credibility of her\nwitnesses, or referring to evidence outside the record to bolster their credibility or attack\nthat of the defendant.” (People v.

Thus a\nprosecutor is not permitted “ ‘to place the prestige of [his] office behind a witness by\noffering the impression that [he] has taken steps to assure a witness’s truthfulness at trial.\n[Citation.] However, so long as a prosecutor’s assurances regarding the apparent honesty\nor reliability of prosecution witnesses are based on the “facts of [the] record and the\ninferences reasonably drawn therefrom, rather than any purported personal knowledge or\n\n\n\n                                             151\n\fbelief,” [his] comments cannot be characterized as improper vouching. [Citations.]’\n[Citation.]” (Ward, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 215.)\n         Defendant contends the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of John Williams\nwhen he said the following, in rebuttal to defense counsel’s argument about\nMr. Williams’s testimony (including that the prosecutors “knew that John Williams was\nlying” and that “John Williams is just simply delusional”): “[Defense counsel] went on\nand on [about John Williams]. And I think she said that John Williams was delusional.\n[¶] Please as we talk this morning I’m going to ask you a number of times to think back\nand remember witnesses and how they testified on the stand. John Williams is an elected\nofficial in Orange County. A long time public servant. At the time of the repossession of\nthe car, he was a deputy marshal in Orange County. . . . [¶] I don’t think anyone in this\ncourtroom would argue with it, his dates were probably off by a year or so.” After\ndescribing his testimony, the prosecutor continued: “You saw this man on the stand.\nYou’ll have to make that judgment. But I would submit to you that what he told you and\nhow this went down and what [defendant] said about Mickey Thompson is absolutely\ntrue.”\n         Once again, defense counsel posed no objection to the prosecutor’s remarks at\ntrial, so the claim of misconduct is forfeited. In any event, the prosecutor’s statements\nwere not improper vouching. Defendant says the prosecutor was “vouching about\nWilliams’ status as an elected official and a marshal,” and “expressed his personal belief\nin Williams’ credibility.” But Mr. Williams testified that he was elected as the Orange\nCounty Public Administrator, and that he had been a deputy marshal, so the prosecutor’s\nremarks about his status were “ ‘based on the “facts of [the] record . . . rather than any\npurported personal knowledge or belief,” ’ ” so that comment “ ‘cannot be characterized\nas improper vouching.’ ” (Ward, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 215.)\n         As for the prosecutor’s statement that he “would submit to you that what\n[Mr. Williams] told you . . . is absolutely true,” the prosecutor preceded that statement\nwith a description of his testimony and with the proviso that “[y]ou’ll have to make that\njudgment.” Considered in context, this was not improper vouching.

After pointing out that defendant “was positively identified by two\nindependent witnesses three days before the murders doing surveillance right at the\n\n                                             153\n\fperfect spot for ingress and egress in and out of Bradbury,” the prosecutor said: “I expect\nthat [defense counsel]’s going to stand up here and say, wait a minute, you can’t believe\nthe Stevenses identification. [Defendant] was never out there. He was never at that\nscene. [¶] Well, where is his alibi?” (At this point, defense counsel objected, the trial\ncourt overruled the objection, defense counsel cited Griffin error, and the trial court said\nthat would be discussed later.) The prosecutor continued: “If someone -- let’s see it’s ten\nminutes -- that’s seven minutes until 11:00 on December 18th, 2006. If someone said,\nhey, Mr. Jackson, you committed a crime on that day; or you were at such and such spot\non that day. I would call every single person in this courtroom and subpoena them to\ncourt to say, no, at six minutes until 11:00 on December 18, 2006, he was standing on a\nswatch of carpet eight feet in front of me.”\n       The prosecutor then described the subpoena power, and said: “The defense could\nhave called any witness they wanted to to provide an alibi for [defendant]. One of the\nmost important days of his life was March 16th, 1988. He found out that Mickey\nThompson and Trudy Thompson had been killed. If you believe the defense, he found\nout for the first time. [¶] Of course the evidence suggests that he found out that his plan\nhad worked. But even assuming that the defense is right and he didn’t know anything,\nthen why didn’t they call an employee; a business partner; somebody to say, hey, that\nweek before the murders [defendant] was with me. [¶] But you heard nothing from that.\nWhy? Because [defendant] was in front of the Stevens’ house three days before the\nmurders.”\n       After the argument, defense counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that the\nprosecutor’s comment was misconduct, as it was “commenting on the defendant’s refusal\nto testify by implication,” and “[i]f [defendant] were to present an alibi, that would\nrequire him to testify.” The court denied the request, saying, “this is a murky area,” but\n“I don’t view the statement commenting on the failure to call logical witnesses to testify\nas to [defendant’s] whereabouts on the day . . . of the Stevenses’ observation” as Griffin\nerror. “[A] lot of cases . . . indicate that that is a fine line. I don’t think the People have\ncrossed that line.”\n\n                                               154\n\f          We agree with the trial court. People v.

In that case, the court observed that a prosecutor “may commit\nGriffin error if he or she argues to the jury that certain testimony or evidence is\nuncontradicted, if such contradiction or denial could be provided only by the defendant,\nwho therefore would be required to take the witness stand.” (Id. at p. 1339.) In\nBradford, “there were brief comments by the prosecution during closing argument noting\nthe absence of evidence contradicting what was produced by the prosecution on several\npoints, and the failure of the defense to introduce material evidence or any alibi\nwitnesses. These comments, however, cannot fairly be interpreted as referring to\ndefendant’s failure to testify. Neither the general comment directed to the lack of defense\nevidence or testimony, nor the more particularized comments regarding . . . the absence\nof alibi for a particular time period, would have required defendant to take the stand.”\n(Ibid.)\n          People v. Vargas (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192852\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192852/people-v-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Vargas) also demonstrates the point.\nThere, the court found Griffin error in the prosecutor’s statement that “ ‘there is no denial\nat all that they were there [robbing Mr. Olness]’ ” (Vargas, at p. 476), and explained:\n“[T]he word ‘denial’ connotes a personal response by the accused himself. Any witness\ncould ‘explain’ the facts, but only defendant himself could ‘deny’ his presence at the\ncrime scene. Accordingly, the jury could have interpreted the prosecutor’s remarks as\ncommenting upon defendant’s failure to take the stand and deny his guilt.” (Ibid.) On\nthe other hand, the court observed, in dicta, that another statement by the prosecutor was\nnot Griffin error. “[D]uring the prosecutor’s closing argument, the prosecutor agreed that\ndefendants did not have to take the stand, but he inquired, ‘Why didn’t they have some\nwitnesses to say where they were on the 29th, on the evening of the 29th. They had to be\nsomewhere . . . .’ ” (Vargas, at p. 474.) As to this statement, the court said, “under the\nrule in [People v. Bethea (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2118461\"><a href=\"/opinion/2118461/people-v-bethea/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936], the prosecutor’s initial\ncomments . . . regarding the lack of alibi witnesses was not Griffin error.” (Id. at p. 476,\nfn. 5.)\n\n\n\n                                             155\n\f       This case is no different from Bradford or Vargas. The prosecutor’s comment,\n“Well, where is his alibi?” may not be plucked from its context and then construed as\nreferring to defendant’s failure to testify. As in Bradford, the prosecutor clearly referred\nto the absence of any alibi witnesses, not to the defendant’s failure himself to testify that\nhe was elsewhere. And as in Bradford, none of the prosecutor’s “comments regarding\n. . . the absence of alibi for a particular time period, would have required defendant to\ntake the stand.” (Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1339.)\n       Defendant insists the prosecutor’s argument was “an attempt to shift the burden of\nproof to [defendant]” by inviting the jury to look to defendant for an explanation of\nwhere he was at the time. This claim has no merit. As Bradford tells us, “[a] distinction\nclearly exists between the permissible comment that a defendant has not produced any\nevidence, and on the other hand an improper statement that a defendant has a duty or\nburden to produce evidence, or a duty or burden to prove his or her innocence.”\n(Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1340.) There was no Griffin error.\n16. The Claim of Outrageous Government Misconduct\n       Defendant’s final contention, like his first, is a claim of outrageous governmental\nmisconduct. This time, the claim is not based on the prosecutor’s conduct relating to\nattorney-client privileged documents. Instead, defendant asserts, among other things, that\nthe prosecutor “relied heavily upon false evidence created by [Los Angeles Sheriff’s\nDepartment]’s investigators in order to arrest and convict [defendant].”\n       The “false evidence” consists of defendant’s contention that Detective Lillienfeld\nrepeatedly lied in sworn statements: in affidavits supporting the Orange County search\nand arrest warrants and the live lineup; in the grand jury proceedings; and at the Orange\nCounty preliminary hearing. The alleged lie was “that [defendant] owned a gun that was\nconsistent with the weapons used in the Thompson murders.” According to defendant,\nthis “false evidence” was used to arrest and charge defendant in Orange County, “setting\nin motion the juggernaut that resulted in [defendant’s] conviction.” In other words, but\nfor Detective Lillienfeld’s “perjury,” the prosecutors would have been unable to obtain\n\n\n\n                                             156\n\fsearch or arrest warrants (and, if the jury had been informed of these “falsehoods,”\ndefendant would have obtained a different result at trial).\n       We reject defendant’s claim of misconduct, both because it was forfeited and\nbecause it has no merit. We turn first to the facts of record relating to the claim of “false\nevidence” used to arrest and charge defendant.\n       a. The “false evidence” claim\n       Defendant repeatedly accuses Detective Lillienfeld of “perjury,” “lies,”\n“manufactur[ing] evidence,” and the like, based principally on the detective’s search\nwarrant affidavit of December 7, 2001, and other sworn testimony before the Orange\nCounty grand jury and at the April 2002 Orange County preliminary hearing, to the effect\nthat a .9-millimeter Smith & Wesson firearm owned by defendant could have been the\nmurder weapon.49 These statements were, according to Detective Lillienfeld, mistaken,\nand, according to defendant, lies. The facts as revealed at trial were these.\n       In the December 2001 affidavit, Detective Lillienfeld averred that Dwight Van\nHorn, firearms examiner at the sheriff’s crime lab, told him that the weapons used in the\nThompson murders had “rifling characteristics of six right lands and grooves,” and that\nthe possible manufacturers included Smith & Wesson, “with three character model\nnumbers.” Federal firearm sales records indicated defendant had purchased a Smith &\nWesson, model 469, in 1984, and the detective’s affidavit stated that “[t]his pistol falls\nwithin the rifling characteristics of the murder weapon, according to Deputy Dwight Van\nHorn . . . .” Similarly, the detective testified to the grand jury that defendant’s firearm\ncould have been a murder weapon. These statements were, as the detective later testified\nin the trial court, incorrect.\n\n\n\n49      We have denied defendant’s request for judicial notice of the Orange County\npreliminary hearing transcript and Detective Lillienfeld’s grand jury testimony. (See\nfn. 7, ante.) We refer to those documents only in the context of statements by counsel in\nthe trial court record and Detective Lillienfeld’s own references, during his trial\ntestimony, to his testimony in Orange County.\n\n\n                                             157\n\f       At the trial, defendant called Detective Lillienfeld as a defense witness, and sought\nto impeach him with previous false statements. This was based on Dwight Van Horn’s\nballistics memorandum, prepared shortly after the murders. The memorandum indicated\nthat certain guns (which included defendant’s) were specifically not included in the\nuniverse of possible guns that could have been used as the murder weapon, while\nDetective Lillienfeld testified in Orange County (and averred in his affidavit) to the\n“exact opposite.” The prosecutor objected, contending Detective Lillienfeld made a\nmistake and misinterpreted Mr. Van Horn’s ballistics report.\n       Defense counsel contended (and continues to do so on appeal) the claim of\nmistake was “incredible” and that, “[b]ased largely on this falsehood, [defendant] was\narrested for the Thompson murders . . . .” (No evidence is cited to support the claim that\ndefendant’s arrest was “[b]ased largely” on the detective’s statements about the gun; the\nsearch warrant affidavit extends to some 54 pages.)\n       The trial court held an Evidence Code section 402 hearing to determine whether\nthere was evidence indicating Detective Lillienfeld “committed a prior act involving\nmoral turpitude,” as such evidence would be relevant to challenge the detective’s\ncredibility. At the hearing, Detective Lillienfeld testified that in July 2001, the sheriff’s\ndepartment tested a Smith & Wesson three-digit model firearm, and the report showed\n“five lands and grooves with a right twist.” Mr. Van Horn did not tell him that the\nmurder weapon had six lands and grooves, and his impression from reading Mr. Van\nHorn’s memorandum was “that a Smith & Wesson .9 millimeter pistol with a three-\ncharacter model number was a potential murder weapon in this case.” Detective\nLillienfeld did not look into any database to determine whether a Smith & Wesson three-\ndigit model number produced five or six lands and grooves.\n       The subject line of Mr. Van Horn’s memorandum was: “.9 Millimeter Pistols to\nbe Eliminated as Suspect Guns.” The list included Smith & Wesson three-digit model\nnumbers, and it also included Glocks, as well as weapons that could have been eliminated\n“just by virtue of sight, for instance, machine-type guns, machine-gun type Uzis, and\nMack Tens.” (A postscript to the memorandum indicated that “maybe we can eliminate\n\n                                             158\n\fthese [Uzis, Mack Tens, etc.] with a photo line-up.”) Detective Lillienfeld was asked if\nhe was aware that “bullets fired from a Glock look completely distinguishable from other\nfirearms,” and responded, “No.” Detective Lillienfeld interpreted the subject line of the\nmemorandum “to mean that the below list of guns should be brought to me I can – ‘me,’\nmeaning Dwight Van Horn, the ballistics expert. I can conduct ballistics exam on them\nand eliminate them as being potentially the murder weapon.” Detective Lillienfeld\nagreed that “it sound[ed] like Mr. Van Horn was saying we can eliminate these guns [the\nUzis, etc.] based on a photo line-up; we can eliminate these guns [the Smith & Wessons,\netc.] based on ballistics,” and that was how he was testifying when he said that “it\nappeared that these guns were in the possible universe of guns that needed to be\neliminated as suspect weapons.”\n        Detective Lillienfeld also testified that, when he spoke to Mr. Van Horn, “I asked\nhim specifically about that memo you’re holding and asked him if those were all possible\nguns. And the response I got was, yes, those are all possible guns that were used in this\ncrime.” Detective Lillienfeld said that no one advised him, before his testimony to the\nOrange County grand jury, “that the murder weapon was not a five land and groove.”\nFurther, he was not aware that the July 2001 test of a Smith & Wesson three-digit model\n“would apply to all three-digit Smith & Wesson models.”\n        Detective Lillienfeld admitted testifying to the grand jury that the three-digit\nmodel Smith & Wesson registered to defendant could have been a murder weapon; that\nhe put that information in subsequent affidavits; and that it was incorrect. He did not\nattempt to verify the information with Mr. Van Horn before testifying, and he did not\nattempt to check databases containing information on the general rifling characteristics of\nthe guns. Detective Lillienfeld became aware of his mistake “I believe some time in\n2001,” when defendant’s appellate attorney identified the error “through a series of\nlitigation in court . . . .”\n        Detective Lillienfeld also testified that the July 2001 test was on a weapon\nregistered to defendant. The detective testified at the Orange County preliminary hearing\nin 2002, and he knew before he testified “that the one – at least the one gun that [he] took\n\n                                             159\n\ffrom [defendant] that was a three-digit model Smith & Wesson was not the murder\nweapon.” He did not so state in his testimony at the Orange County preliminary hearing,\nbut he was not asked that specific question. His understanding was that other three-digit\nmodels (other than the one tested) “could be in the universe of possible suspect guns.”\n       After Detective Lillienfeld’s testimony, defense counsel argued that the jury\nshould decide “whether or not that was a lie or just negligence.” The court ruled\notherwise, observing that “I read [Mr. Van Horn’s memorandum] the same way that the\ndetective did,” and “I would interpret that the same way.” The court said, “I don’t have\nthe experience the detective does, but I certainly can read English,” and concluded, “just\nso it’s clear, I mean there is really nothing in the record to indicate that this witness\ncommitted an act of moral turpitude which would bear on his credibility based on what I\nheard.”\n       b. Other claims\n       In addition to the claim of perjury related to defendant’s firearm, defendant recites,\nat length, other grievances about the investigation.\n       Defendant asserts Detective Lillienfeld and the prosecutors used Gail Moreau-\nHunter’s “demonstrably false” statement that defendant confessed to her in order to\nprosecute defendant. He makes unsupported claims that Detective Lillienfeld “falsely\ntestified” at the Orange County preliminary hearing “that Gail Moreau-Hunter had not\nattempted suicide.”\n       Defendant asserts that Detective Griggs’s investigation was “derailed” by Collene\nCampbell’s interference. (Ms. Campbell complained about Detective Griggs, and\ndefendant’s recitation is based on a memorandum Detective Griggs wrote about the\ninvestigation and Ms. Campbell’s activities in connection with it. None of the facts\ndefendant recites suggests the investigation was “derailed” by Ms. Campbell’s activities.)\n       Defendant asserts that Detective Lillienfeld “permitted Campbell to direct his\ninvestigation.” (Nothing is cited that supports this claim.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              160\n\f       He asserts without record authority that the Los Angeles District Attorney\n“attempted to inhibit all information that did not support the theory [defendant] was\nresponsible for the Thompson murders.”\n       He asserts that Detective Lillienfeld “usurped power” by presenting his case to the\nOrange County District Attorney after the Los Angeles District Attorney rejected it in\n1998, and his actions were “ratified by the OCDA and later by the LADA,” all of which\n“shock[s] the conscience and constitute[s] outrageous government misconduct.”\n       c. Forfeiture of the claim of outrageous government misconduct\n       Defendant forfeited his claim of investigatory misconduct by failing to make it\nbefore the trial court.\n       Defendant concedes the “lack of objection,” but says it would have been futile to\nmake an objection to Detective Lillienfeld’s pretrial misconduct, because (1) the trial\ncourt denied his other motions to dismiss for misconduct (see pt. 1, ante), and (2) after\nthe Evidence Code section 402 hearing just described, the trial court refused to permit\ndefense counsel to impeach Detective Lillienfeld with his “false testimony.” We do not\nagree the claim would have been futile.\n       Defendant’s other motions were based on the seizure, retention and review of\nattorney-client privileged documents, not on the investigatory misconduct defendant now\nasserts. Moreover, defendant now makes claims of improper interference with the\ninvestigation, usurpation of power, and the like, in addition to the claims of “perjury” and\n“manufactured evidence.” There is no excuse for the failure to make these claims to the\ntrial court, which repeatedly showed its willingness to entertain defense objections and\nmotions on all manner of claims.\n       The cases defendant cites to support his claim of futility show that futility is an\nappropriate basis for a failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct in extreme cases,\nwhere the misconduct is pervasive and the trial court does not act. (See, e.g., Dykes,\nsupra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 775 [rejecting futility argument; unlike the case in Hill, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, “the present case did not involve counsel experiencing—as did counsel in\nHill—a ‘constant barrage’ of misstatements, demeaning sarcasm, and falsehoods, or\n\n                                             161\n\fongoing hostility on the part of the trial court, to appropriate, well-founded objections”].)\nThis is obviously not such a case.\n       Further, the claims defendant makes are precisely the sort of claims that require\nfact finding and credibility determinations by the trial court. All the evidence defendant\nasserts in support of his claims was available at the time of trial. In short, defendant does\nnot present a compelling case for excusing the forfeiture of his claims of investigatory\nmisconduct.\n       d. The merits\n       Defendant has forfeited his claim of outrageous government misconduct, but in\nany event it has no merit. We briefly address each of defendant’s assertions (except for\nthose already described, in subpart b., ante, as having no support in the record).\n       First, there is the claim of “perjury” in connection with defendant’s firearm. As\ndescribed above, the trial court heard Detective Lillienfeld’s testimony on those points,\nand found “nothing in the record to indicate that this witness committed an act of moral\nturpitude which would bear on his credibility . . . .” We are bound by that determination.\n(See Ochoa, supra, 6 Cal.4th at p. 1206 [“we must . . . not substitute our evaluation of a\nwitness’s credibility for that of the fact finder”].) As our recitation above shows,\nsubstantial evidence supported the trial court’s credibility determination.\n       Defendant insists it is “inherently improbable” that Detective Lillienfeld did not\nrealize defendant’s weapon could not have been the murder weapon, citing People v.\nHeadlee (1941) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454730/people-v-headlee/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267 (appellate court may set aside a conviction where\n“the evidence relied upon by the prosecution is so improbable as to be incredible”). But\n“[t]o be improbable on its face the evidence must assert that something has occurred that\nit does not seem possible could have occurred under the circumstances disclosed.” (Ibid.;\nsee People v. Mayberry (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161125\"><a href=\"/opinion/1161125/people-v-mayberry/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 [“To warrant the rejection of the\nstatements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court, there must exist\neither a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without\nresorting to inferences or deductions.”].) This is not such a case.\n\n\n\n                                             162\n\f       Next, defendant contends Detective Lillienfeld and the prosecutors used\n“demonstrably false” statements from Gail Moreau-Hunter (that defendant confessed to\nher), in order to prosecute defendant. (Ms. Hunter testified at the preliminary hearing –\nbut not at trial – to the effect that defendant told her he hired two black teenagers to carry\nout the murders.) Defendant’s idea of “demonstrably false” is not ours. Defendant relies\non medical records not in evidence for the proposition that Ms. Moreau-Hunter was\n“delusional” and therefore her preliminary hearing testimony was “inherently improbable\nand demonstrably false.” We will not make the leap from allegations (without\nevidentiary support) of severe mental illness to conclusions that testimony is\n“demonstrably false.” Nor will we assume that the prosecutors knew Ms. Moreau-\nHunter’s statements were false when she testified at the preliminary hearing, as the record\nis devoid of any such evidence. And, of course, defendant could not have been\nprejudiced by the use of Ms. Moreau-Hunter’s testimony at the preliminary hearing, as\ndefendant was convicted at trial without it.\n       Next, defendant makes a convoluted argument that Detective Lillienfeld “usurped\npower,” “engaged in forum-shopping,” and acted as “a rogue officer proceeding under\nthe political influence of a private citizen, Campbell” when he “expand[ed] his\ninvestigation into Orange County” and presented his case to the Orange County District\nAttorney after the Los Angeles District Attorney rejected it in 1998. This claim suffers\nfrom the same flaws as defendant’s other claims of misconduct.\n       First, defendant cites no evidence whatever for the assertion that Detective\nLillienfeld acted at the behest of Collene Campbell. Second, defendant cites Penal Code\nsection 830.1, and other authorities that likewise have no pertinence, to support his claim\nthat the detective “lacked authority to expand his investigation into Orange County.”\nSection 830.1 provides just the opposite: it states, among other things, that a deputy\nsheriff is a peace officer and his authority extends “to any place in the state” as to any\npublic offense committed “within the political subdivision that employs the peace\nofficer . . . .” (Pen. Code, § 830.1, subd. (a)(1).) Third, defendant cites no authority on\n“forum-shopping” by a peace officer, and his recitation of the law on venue is simply\n\n                                               163\n\finapt; the venue issue was resolved long ago in defendant’s favor. (Indeed, the Court of\nAppeal in that case mentioned defendant’s earlier claims of conflict of interest in the\nOrange County district attorney’s personal relationship with Mickey Thompson’s sister,\nCollene Campbell, noting that it had allowed defendant “to pursue his assertion below\nthat Orange County lacked any disinterested purpose in prosecution.” (Goodwin v.\nSuperior Court, supra, G031285, pp. 2-3.))\n       In short, defendant has made no showing that Detective Lillienfeld’s conduct\nconsisted of anything other than disinterested activity aimed at bringing the person\nresponsible for the Thompson murders to account. The same is true of defendant’s claim\nthat prosecutors in both counties “ced[ed] essential prosecution functions to Campbell,\nand prosecut[ed] [defendant] based on Campbell’s political power, influence and\nconnections rather than untainted facts obtained in an unbiased manner.” This is nothing\nbut hyperbole, without support in any evidence.\n       Finally, we note again that “a showing of prejudice to defendant’s right to a fair\ntrial [is] required” to sustain a due process claim of outrageous government conduct, and\n“the absence of such a showing preclude[s] dismissal as a sanction for prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” (Uribe, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 861.) None of defendant’s allegations\nsupports the notion that he received anything other than a fair trial.\n17. Cumulative Error\n       Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the various errors he asserts requires\nreversal. Because we have found no error that, either alone or in conjunction with others,\nprejudiced defendant, we necessarily conclude there was no cumulative error.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                 GRIMES, J.\n       We concur:\n\n\n              BIGELOW, P. J.                                     RUBIN, J.\n\n                                             164\n\f</pre>",
