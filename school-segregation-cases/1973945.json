They argued that NM M I’s denial of their\n\nchild’s application for admission violated all three statutes, and sought a\n\ndeclaration from the district court that N M M I is bound by the ID EA.\n\n      The IDEA requires states that accept federal special education funds to\n\nprovide disabled children with a “free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) in\n\nthe “least restrictive environment” (“LRE”). It guarantees that such an education\n\nis given by instructing states to create an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”)\n\nfor each child within its care. As part of the bargain, however, Congress requires\n\nparents to exhaust IDEA’s administrative procedures and remedies before filing\n\nsuit in federal court. The district court questioned whether the Ellenbergs\n\n\n\n\n      *\n         The Honorable Eugene E. Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for\nthe Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsatisfied this mandate, but nonetheless addressed the merits of the ID EA claim. It\n\nwas error to do so.\n\n      W e hold today that before a party may seek relief in federal court alleging a\n\nviolation of the IDEA ’s substantive provisions, a party must first request an IEP\n\nfor the disabled child, or seek a change to a current IEP if one exists, from the\n\nagency designated to create that plan under the state’s educational framework.\n\nBecause it is undisputed that plaintiffs never attempted to amend their child’s\n\nexisting IEP or obtain a new IEP before pursuing the IDEA claim, they have\n\nfailed to exhaust the ID EA’s administrative procedures and remedies.\n\n      Under our precedent, parties are precluded from bringing claims under the\n\nADA and the RA that are educational in nature if they have failed to exhaust\n\nIDEA’s administrative procedures, and relief for their injuries is available under\n\nthe ID EA. Although we hold that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust IDEA’s\n\nadministrative procedures, they are unable to obtain relief under the IDEA for\n\ntheir pure discrimination claims brought pursuant to the RA and ADA, and thus\n\nare not barred from bringing these claims in federal court at this time. The\n\ndistrict court’s sole basis for granting summary judgment to N M M I on these\n\nclaims was that plaintiffs’ IDEA claim failed. Because plaintiffs’ claims under\n\nthe RA and ADA are separate and distinct from the IDEA claim, the district\n\ncourt’s ruling in favor of NM M I on this basis was in error.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      Accordingly, we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\n\nREV ER SE the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of NM M I on\n\nthe IDEA claim, and R EM A N D with instructions to dismiss that claim for lack of\n\njurisdiction. W e REV ER SE the district court’s grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of NM M I on the Ellenbergs’ claims under Title II of the ADA and § 504 of\n\nthe RA, and R EM A N D for reconsideration of the motion for summary judgment\n\non the ADA and RA claims.\n\n                                         I\n\n      Before addressing the Ellenbergs’ claims, we consider the education law\n\nframew ork under which they seek to be brought. W hen analyzed in concert, the\n\nIDEA, New M exico’s education laws, and NM M I’s unique status provide a\n\ncomplex legal backdrop with numerous interconnections, cross-definitions, and a\n\nfew seeming contradictions.\n\n                                         A\n\n      Congress passed the IDEA, 1 a federal spending statute, in response to\n\nconcerns about the educational opportunities afforded disabled students.\n\nConsidered an “ambitious federal effort to promote the education of handicapped\n\n\n\n      1\n         Formerly titled the Education of the Handicapped Act, the name of the\nAct was officially changed to the IDEA in 1990. See Education of the\nHandicapped Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-476, 104 Stat. 1141. For\nclarity’s sake, we have changed all references to the EH A in prior opinions and\nlegislative materials to the IDEA. All statutory citations refer to the 2000 edition\nof the United States Code, which was in effect during the relevant period.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fchildren,” the IDEA “provides federal money to assist state and local agencies in\n\neducating handicapped children, and conditions such funding upon a State’s\n\ncompliance with [its] extensive goals and procedures.” See Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 179 (1982).\n\n      At base, it “ensure[s] that all children with disabilities have available to\n\nthem a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and\n\nrelated services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for\n\nemployment and independent living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d). To this end, in order\n\nto receive federal funding the state must create an individualized education plan\n\nfor each disabled child. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(4); See O’Toole ex rel. O’Toole v.\n\nOlathe Dist. Schs. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 233, 144 F.3d 692, 698 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n      Prepared at meetings between a representative of the local school\n      district, the child’s teacher, the parents or guardians, and, whenever\n      appropriate, the disabled child, the IEP sets out the child’s present\n      educational performance, establishes annual and short-term\n      objectives for improvements in that performance, and describes the\n      specially designed instruction and services that will enable the child\n      to meet those objectives.\n\nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988) (internal citations omitted); see 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1414(d). Review of IEPs must occur at least annually, and are to be\n\nrevised as appropriate. Id.\n\n      By passing the IDEA, Congress also sought to “mainstream” disabled\n\nchildren, i.e., states must have a goal of providing “full educational opportunity to\n\n                                         -5-\n\fall children with disabilities and a detailed timetable for accomplishing that goal.”\n\n§ 1412(a)(2). Each child has a substantive right to receive his or her education in\n\nthe “least restrictive environment.” See § 1412(a)(5)(A). That is, students must\n\nbe educated “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate . . . with children who are not\n\ndisabled” in a “regular educational environment.” Id. States are prohibited from\n\nsegregating or otherwise removing disabled children from the regular classroom\n\nsetting except “when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that\n\neducation in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services\n\ncannot be achieved satisfactorily.” Id.; see Honig, 484 U.S. at 311.\n\n      In conjunction with this right, “[e]ach public agency must ensure that a\n\ncontinuum of alternative placements is available to meet the needs of children\n\nwith disabilities for special education and related services.” 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 300.115(a). Placement decisions must be based on the child’s IEP, and made by\n\n“a group of persons, including the parents, and other persons knowledgeable\n\nabout the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options.”\n\n§ 300.116(a)(1). Unless a child’s IEP requires some other arrangement, the child\n\nshould be “educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled.” Id.\n\n      The IDEA also sought to maximize parental involvement in educational\n\ndecisions affecting their disabled child by granting parents a number of\n\nprocedural rights. For example, parents are entitled to: (1) examine all records\n\nrelating to their child, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1); (2) participate in the IEP\n\n                                         -6-\n\fpreparation process, id.; (3) obtain an independent evaluation of their child, id.;\n\n(4) receive notice before an amendment to an IEP is either proposed or refused,\n\n§ 1415(b)(3); (5) take membership in any group that makes decisions about the\n\neducational placement of their child, § 1414(f); and (6) receive formal notice of\n\ntheir rights under the IDEA, § 1415(d)(1).\n\n      Responsibility for implementing the IDEA and policing IDEA compliance\n\nrests with the states, subject to the IDEA’s limited but specific structural\n\nframew ork. Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. W east, 126 S. Ct. 528, 531 (2005) (citing\n\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 183). Each “State Educational Agency” (“SEA”) must enact\n\nprocedures and policies to implement the IDEA, and ensure both state and local\n\ncompliance w ith the Act. 20 U.S.C § 1412(a)(11). “Local Education Agencies” 2\n\n(“LEAs”) are given primary responsibility for overseeing the actual provision of\n\nspecial education services to disabled children. See § 1413(a)(1); Gadsby v.\n\nGrasmick, 109 F.3d 940, 942-43 (4th Cir. 1997). SEAs ensure LEA compliance\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          An LEA is\n\n      a public board of education or other public authority legally\n      constituted within a State for either administrative control or\n      direction of, or to perform a service function for, public elementary\n      or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or\n      other political subdivision of a State, or for such combination of\n      school districts or counties as are recognized in a State as an\n      administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(15)(A).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthrough the pow er of the purse: Federal IDEA funds are distributed to the SEA,\n\nand those funds may not be forwarded to LEAs within the state unless they\n\ndemonstrate compliance with the ID EA to the satisfaction of the SEA. § 1413(a),\n\n(d). In addition, the IDEA places an obligation to provide special education\n\nservices on “public agencies” that are “responsible for providing education to\n\nchildren with disabilities,” 34 C.F.R. § 300.53, as well as on “education services\n\nagencies” that have “administrative control and direction” over a public\n\nsecondary school, § 300.12.\n\n      Should an LEA or state agency prove “unable to establish and maintain\n\nprograms of free appropriate public education in compliance with IDEA,” the\n\nSEA must provide special education and related services directly to disabled\n\nchildren. 20 U.S.C. § 1413(h)(1). In so doing, the SEA “may provide special\n\neducation and related services . . . in such a manner and at such locations\n\n(including regional or state centers) as the State agency considers appropriate.”\n\n§ 1413(h)(2). However, the SEA is required to comply with IDEA requirements\n\nas if it w ere an LEA. 34 C.F.R. § 300.175.\n\n      W hen parents believe their child is not being provided a FAPE in the least\n\nrestrictive environment, they are entitled to an impartial due process hearing,\n\nconducted by either the SEA or the LEA as determined by state law. 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(f). If the hearing is held before an LEA, the losing party may appeal to\n\nthe SEA. § 1415(g). Once state administrative procedures and remedies are\n\n                                         -8-\n\fexhausted, any party “aggrieved” by the hearing officer’s decision has a right to\n\nfile a civil action in state or federal court. § 1415(i)(2).\n\n                                            B\n\n      New M exico’s constitution gives each child the right to a free public\n\neducation. N.M . Const. art. XII, § 1; see also N.M . Stat. § 22-1-4. 3 The New\n\nM exico legislature has defined this right as an entitlement to attend a public\n\nschool within the school district 4 in which the student resides. N.M . Stat. § 22-\n\n12-4. Students may also attend other public schools w ithin the state subject to\n\navailability, as determined by “enrollment preferences.” Id.\n\n      The New M exico Public Education Department (“NM PED”) (formerly the\n\n“State Board of Education”) controls, manages, and directs all public schools in\n\nthe state, and is authorized to promulgate and enforce regulations tow ards these\n\nends. N.M . Const. art. XII, § 6; N.M . Stat. § 22-2-1. NM PED is the “sole\n\neducational agency of the state for the administration or for the supervision of the\n\nadministration of any state plan established or funds received by the state by\n\nvirtue of any federal statute relating to aid for education” for the state’s general\n\npublic school system. N.M . Stat. § 22-9-2. At the local level, each school district\n\n\n      3\n        All references to New M exico statutes refer to those in effect at the times\nrelevant to this action, unless otherwise specified.\n      4\n       A “school district” is defined as “an area of land established as a political\nsubdivision of the state for the administration of public schools and segregated\ngeographically for taxation and bonding purposes.” N.M . Stat. §§ 22-3-54.1, 22-\n4-1.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fis governed by a local school board, which is authorized to establish rules\n\ngoverning enrollment in the district’s public schools and develop the district’s\n\neducational policies. N.M . Stat. §§ 22-1-4(e), 22-5-4.\n\n      New M exico has long provided special education services to its residents.\n\nAlthough NM PED is required to promulgate rules and standards governing the\n\nprovision of special education services, local school districts are responsible for\n\ndirectly providing special education and related services to disabled students.\n\nN.M . Stat. § 22-13-5. New M exico has chosen to accept IDEA funds, and has\n\nadopted rules to comply with IDEA’s requirements accordingly. For purposes of\n\nthe IDEA, New M exico’s SEA is the NM PED, and its LEAs are generally the\n\nlocal school districts.\n\n      NM PED’s regulations largely track the federal act, and are “binding on\n\neach New M exico public agency that has direct or delegated authority to provide\n\nspecial education and related services, regardless of whether that agency is\n\nreceiving funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.” N.M .\n\nCode R. § 6.31.2.2. LEAs are tasked with developing IEPs for children within\n\ntheir educational jurisdiction. § 6.31.2.11(A)(3)(g). Should the LEA ultimately\n\ndetermine that the general public school system is unable to meet the needs of a\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fdisabled student, it may request that the student be placed in a state-supported\n\neducational agency, 5 § 6.31.2.11(J)(1)(c), or in a “private school or facility.”\n\n§ 6.31.2.11(L)(1). Neither type of institution is required to admit such student\n\nupon referral; rather, it may “consider the child for possible enrollment.”\n\n§ 6.31.2.11(J)(1)(C). If a child is accepted, the accepting institution assumes\n\nprimary responsibility for providing the child with a FAPE. § 6.31.2.11(J)(2).\n\n                                          C\n\n      NM M I is a state educational institution that offers a college preparatory\n\neducation in a military-style setting to students nationwide, although a preference\n\nis given to New M exicans. N.M . Const. art. XII, § 11; N.M . Stat. §§ 21-12, 22-1-\n\n2(V). The parties agree that NM M I is a unique educational institution – it is the\n\nonly publicly-funded, boarding military high school in New M exico, and appears\n\nto be the only one of its kind in the nation. NM M I is unique in other ways as\n\nwell. Although it receives substantial state funding, New M exico does not\n\n\n\n      5\n          A “state-supported educational agency” is a publicly funded program that\n\n      (a) provides special education and related services to children with\n      disabilities who come w ithin the program’s educational jurisdiction;\n      (b) is operated by, or under contractual arrangements for, a state\n      school, state educational institution or other state institution, state\n      hospital or state agency; and (c) is primarily funded through direct\n      legislative appropriations or other direct state support to a public\n      agency other than a local school district.\n\nN.M . Code R. § 6.31.2.7(C)(18).\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\fconsider N M M I to be a part of the uniform system of free public schools\n\nmandated by the New M exico Constitution. It is also specifically exempted from\n\nNM PED’s general oversight and control. § 22-2-2(J). Instead, it is governed by a\n\nBoard of R egents charged to “maintain and control, at Roswell, a military\n\ninstitute for the education and training of the youth in this country, of as high a\n\nstandard as like institutions in other states and territories,” and promulgate rules\n\nand regulations accordingly. § 21-12-3, -4. The Board fixes both NM M I’s tuition\n\nrate – NM M I must charge tuition under state law – and its admissions standards.\n\n§ 21-12-1, -2, -4, -7.\n\n      NM M I’s admissions standards are rather precise: Applicants must have a\n\nminimum 2.5 grade point average, satisfactorily complete the on-campus\n\nadmissions test, be in good physical condition, show respect for others, be able to\n\nparticipate in athletic and leadership development activities, and have no major\n\ndisciplinary, drug, or alcohol problems. There are also a number of specified\n\ndisqualifying attributes identified in NM M I’s 2002-2003 admissions catalog,\n\nincluding:\n\n      regularly scheduled psychological counseling or any other severe\n      psychological disorders or limiting condition[s] which in the opinion\n      of the medical staff would interfere with the cadet’s ability to\n      function satisfactorily at [NM M I], [or a] demonstrated [] inability to\n      meet the existing NM M I academic requirements without significant\n      accommodations that would alter the academic mission of [NM M I].\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\f      NM M I is not a New M exico school district that is required to provide\n\nspecial education services under N ew M exico law. See N.M . Stat. § 22-1-2(R ).\n\nThroughout this litigation, NM M I has taken the position that it is also not bound\n\nby the IDEA. Nonetheless, NM M I contends it has admitted disabled applicants as\n\nlong as they are “otherwise qualified,” but will not alter its programs to\n\naccom odate those with special needs. 6\n\n                                           D\n\n      S.E. is the child of Bob and Karen Ellenberg. In late 2000 S.E. moved to\n\nLos Alamos, New M exico to live with her father, after exhibiting significant\n\nbehavioral problems while living with her mother in Florida. Unfortunately,\n\nS.E.’s problems worsened in New M exico, where she engaged in high-risk\n\nactivities, including the abuse of various illegal drugs. W hen plaintiffs enrolled\n\nS.E. at Los Alamos High School (“LA HS”), the public high school serving her\n\nschool district, they informed school officials about her problems and requested\n\nthat S.E. be closely monitored. The Ellenbergs did not, however, request that\n\nLAHS provide S.E. with special education services. 7 Soon after she started\n\nattending LAHS, S.E. stole her parents’ car and credit card, prompting the\n\nexasperated Ellenbergs to press charges against her. During subsequent court\n\n\n\n      6\n       NM M I expressly informs potential applicants that its admission standards\n“may exclude students with specific disabilities.”\n      7\n          Her father testified that he did not know he should request such services.\n                                          - 13 -\n\fproceedings related to that incident, S.E. received a “W aiver of Time Limitation,”\n\nunder w hich all charges would be dismissed if she satisfied certain conditions.\n\n      One of those conditions was placement in a court-ordered residential\n\ntreatment program. S.E. was assigned to Casa de Corazon (“CdC”), a treatment\n\nfacility located in Taos, New M exico. In November 2002, the Taos M unicipal\n\nSchool District evaluated S.E. and concluded she qualified for special education\n\nservices on the basis of an emotional disability. 8 It accordingly prepared an IEP\n\nfor her, which recommended both a course of study – S.E. was to receive high\n\nschool curriculum – and a behavioral intervention plan. LAHS was identified in\n\nthe IEP as S.E.’s public high school based on her residency, but because of her\n\nbehavioral and social problems the IEP recommended residential treatment\n\nelsewhere. Specifically, the IEP team determined that S.E. needed a “small,\n\nstructured learning environment” and “careful monitoring.” CdC, with a\n\nprofessional staff trained to address her unique needs, was thus identified as her\n\nLRE. The IEP w as to be reviewed one year from the date it was created or at the\n\ntime of her discharge, whichever occurred first.\n\n      S.E. (then fifteen) anticipated being discharged from CdC during the\n\nsummer following the 2002-2003 school year. Rather than requesting an IEP for\n\nthe upcoming school year from either the Los Alamos School District or the Taos\n\n\n\n      8\n        S.E. was diagnosed with Oppositional D efiance Disorder (“ODD”), a\ndisorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association.\n                                        - 14 -\n\fM unicipal School District, her undisputed LEAs for IDEA purposes, the\n\nEllenbergs allowed S.E. to apply directly to N M M I for the fall 2003 semester. In\n\nher application packet, the Ellenbergs disclosed that S.E. had previously exhibited\n\n“a lot of disciplinary problems,” was currently enrolled in a residential treatment\n\nprogram in Taos, was diagnosed with ODD, and was taking medication to control\n\nher behavioral problems. They noted, however, that S.E. was now determined to\n\nchange her ways and showed signs of progress on that front. S.E. also included a\n\npersonal letter outlining her reasons for seeking admission: She “want[s] a good\n\neducation, and want[s] to be in the military.”\n\n      In June 2003 NM M I notified the Ellenbergs that S.E. would not be admitted\n\nfor the fall semester, but would be considered for the winter semester if she\n\ndemonstrated an ability to succeed in a regular classroom setting. Dissatisfied\n\nw ith that decision, plaintiffs submitted personal letters and testimonials from tw o\n\nof S.E.’s treating therapists at CdC. Although the therapists corroborated\n\nplaintiffs’ belief that S.E. showed signs of improvement, they noted that S.E.’s\n\ndifficulties with anger and authority persisted. One therapist recommended that\n\nS.E. start at NM M I in August, opining that S.E.’s continued need for a “structured\n\nlearning environment” would be satisfied at NM M I. 9\n\n\n      9\n        At the same time CdC personnel recommended S.E. for admission to\nNM M I, they prepared a treatment plan for S.E. noting her continuing authority\nproblems, inability to control her temper and impulses, touchy demeanor,\ndifficulty limiting her “cussing,” and difficulty in getting along with her peer\n                                                                        (continued...)\n                                        - 15 -\n\f      Despite these efforts, NM M I upheld its decision based on (1) S.E.’s\n\npresence in CdC, (2) her admitted past drug use, (3) her present medication\n\nrequirements, and (4) her need for continued counseling. Again, NM M I\n\nsuggested that S.E. reapply for the winter semester after demonstrating the ability\n\nto succeed in “an educational environment other than a Residential Treatment\n\nFacility.” The Ellenbergs opted to pursue an alternate approach.\n\n      Days later, they filed a request with NM PED for an IDEA administrative\n\ndue process hearing against NM M I. Plaintiffs argued NM M I’s refusal to provide\n\nS.E. with a FAPE violated her rights under the IDEA and § 504 of the RA. W hen\n\nNM PED assigned a hearing officer to address the claim, NM M I entered a limited\n\nappearance solely for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction. NM M I posited that\n\nbecause it is not a “public school or agency” it is not bound by the provisions of\n\nthe IDEA or § 504 of the RA. The hearing officer found against NM M I on the\n\njurisdictional question, but ultimately ruled in favor of NM M I on the merits. She\n\nconcluded that NM M I was not required to provide S.E. with a FAPE under the\n\nID EA or the RA because plaintiffs failed to show S.E. was otherwise qualified to\n\nattend NM M I. Both parties filed administrative appeals: NM M I contested the\n\njurisdictional finding; plaintiffs challenged the ruling that S.E. was not otherwise\n\n\n\n      9\n       (...continued)\ngroup. In that plan, they also concluded that she remained depressed, refused to\ntake responsibility for her actions on certain occasions, and continued to have\nanger outbursts, albeit less frequently and for shorter periods of time.\n                                       - 16 -\n\fqualified. Concluding that the hearing officer wrongly decided that NM M I was a\n\n“public school or agency” bound by the IDEA and the RA, the administrative\n\nappeals officer dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nor, in the alternative, failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\nTheir IDEA claim, the appeals officer noted, “borders on being wholly\n\ninsubstantial and frivolous.”\n\n      The Ellenbergs then filed a civil action in federal court against NM M I\n\nasserting claims under the ID EA, § 504 of the RA, and Title II of the ADA.\n\nAlthough it recognized “exhaustion concerns” due to plaintiffs’ failure to obtain\n\nan IEP from an LEA before filing suit, the district court proceeded to address the\n\nmerits. It first rejected the IDEA claim, interpreting plaintiffs’ argument under\n\nthe ID EA as follows: The ID EA provides students with the right to choose w here\n\nthey will receive a FAPE, i.e., which school is the student’s least restrictive\n\nenvironment, and thus S.E. has a right to choose to receive a FAPE from NM M I.\n\nIn its order, the court found that nothing within the IDEA’s provisions cited by\n\nplaintiffs “support[s] the theory that special education is merely a service that\n\nmust be provided wherever the student chooses to attend school.” See Ellenberg\n\nv. N. M . M ilitary Inst., No. CV-04-00347 PK/D JS, slip. op. at 28 (D .N.M .\n\nFebruary 7, 2005). Its findings expressly noted, however, that the court was not\n\naddressing whether “NM M I must provide a FAPE for a child with a disability\n\nadmitted to NM M I.” Relying on this circuit’s decision in Urban ex rel. Urban v.\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\fJefferson County Sch. Dist. R-1, 89 F.3d 720 (10th Cir. 1996), the court also\n\ngranted summary judgment to NM M I on the ADA and the RA claims, finding that\n\nif the state satisfied its obligations under the IDEA it was not required to do more\n\nunder the ADA or the RA.\n\n                                           II\n\n      W e review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same standard employed by the district court. See L.B. ex rel. K.B.\n\nv. Nebo Sch. Dist., 379 F.3d 966, 974 (10th Cir. 2004). That standard was\n\ndescribed in detail in Nebo Sch. Dist.:\n\n             The ID EA sets up a unique standard for a federal court’s\n      review of the administrative due process hearing. A district court\n      applies a modified de novo standard in reviewing a hearing officer’s\n      decision under the IDEA. It looks at the record of the administrative\n      proceedings and decides, based on a preponderance of the evidence,\n      whether the requirements of the IDEA are met. In so doing, it must\n      give “due w eight” to the hearing officer’s findings of fact, which are\n      considered prima facie correct. Although the district court may\n      accept additional evidence, such evidence is merely supplemental to\n      the administrative record. . . .\n             ....\n             . . . Because the IDEA requires a district court to grant a\n      judgment on the record based on its own ascertainment of the\n      preponderance of the evidence, many IDEA claims do not fit into the\n      typical summary judgment standard of “no genuine issues of material\n      fact.”\n\nId. at 973-74 (internal citations omitted). Any legal determinations made by the\n\ndistrict court interpreting the ID EA are reviewed de novo. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 18 -\n\f      As an initial matter, it is important to understand what the Ellenbergs are\n\nnot arguing. They do not claim that either the Los Alamos or Taos M unicipal\n\nSchool D istricts – S.E.’s LEAs – were unable to provide her w ith a FAPE.\n\nCompare O’Toole ex rel. O’Toole, 144 F.3d at 695. Nor do they claim that S.E.\n\nwas denied a FAPE or appropriate reimbursement following her admission to\n\nNM M I, compare Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993),\n\nbecause S.E. was never admitted to NM M I. Notably, this is not a suit brought\n\nagainst the State of New M exico, the Governor, or the head of NM PED, arguing\n\nthat NM M I’s failure to offer special education services (1) violates N ew M exico’s\n\nobligation under the IDEA to have a goal of full educational equality, or (2)\n\ncategorically denies S.E. a FAPE in the least restrictive environment by limiting\n\nthe continuum of placements her LEAs may consider. Compare Ass’n for Cmty.\n\nLiving in Colo. v. Romer, 992 F.2d 1040 (10th Cir. 1993); Eva N. v. Brock, 943\n\nF.2d 51 (6th Cir. 1991); N.M . Ass’n for Retarded Citizens v. New M exico, 678\n\nF.2d 847 (10th Cir. 1982) (challenging New M exico’s state education system\n\nbased on § 504 of the RA); Bitsilly v. Bureau of Indian Affairs, 253 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1257, 1259-60 (D .N.M . 2003).\n\n      Instead, plaintiffs argue: (1) NM M I’s failure to offer education services to\n\ndisabled children, including S.E., caused its denial of her application; and (2)\n\nNM M I was required to provide S.E. with a FAPE because she is entitled to an\n\neducation in the least restrictive environment, which is NM M I.\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\f      The Ellenbergs misunderstand the IDEA. In their brief, which relies heavily\n\non anti-discrimination hyperbole, they view the IDEA as a virtual treasure trove\n\nproviding disabled children with a limitless number of substantive rights. The\n\nIDEA, however, is not so broad. It is a spending statute that imposes obligations\n\non the states to provide certain benefits in exchange for federal funds. See\n\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 204 n.26. Although “Congress has broad power to set the\n\nterms on w hich it disburses federal money to the States, . . . when Congress\n\nattaches conditions to a State’s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must be\n\nset out ‘unambiguously.’” Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. M urphy, 126\n\nS.Ct. 2455, 2459 (2006) (internal citation omitted). Courts engage in a two-step\n\ninquiry to determine if a state has satisfied its substantive ID EA obligations.\n\n“First, has the State complied with the procedures set forth in the Act? A nd\n\nsecond, is the individualized educational program developed through the A ct’s\n\nprocedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\n\nbenefits?” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07.     If the answ er to both is yes, “the State\n\nhas complied with the obligations imposed by Congress and the courts can require\n\nno more.” Id. at 207.\n\n       Citing the IDEA’s 30-year old requirement that states “establish[] a goal of\n\nproviding full educational opportunity to all children with disabilities,” see 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1412(a)(2), plaintiffs argue that the IDEA requires absolute educational\n\nequality. In support, they point to language contained in Congress’ recent\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\freauthorization of the IDEA, specifically Congress’ finding that it is in the\n\n“national interest that the Federal Government have a supporting role in assisting\n\nState and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in order to improve\n\nresults for such children and to ensure equal protection of the law.” 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400(c)(6) (2005). Plaintiffs, however, have not presented us with a single case\n\nfrom any court recognizing a legally cognizable anti-discrimination claim brought\n\nunder the IDEA. 10 M oreover, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected a similar\n\nattempt to transform the IDEA into an anti-discrimination vehicle in a 30-year old\n\ncase, the very case cited by plaintiffs in support of their view. See Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 198 (noting that in passing the IDEA Congress did not intend “to achieve\n\nstrict equality of opportunity or services” and further holding “the requirement\n\nthat a state provide specialized educational services to handicapped children\n\ngenerates no additional requirement that the services so provided be sufficient to\n\nmaximize each child’s potential ‘commensurate with the opportunity provided\n\nother children.’”); see also Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 623\n\nn.6 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting that the ID EA is not a general anti-\n\ndiscrimination statute).\n\n\n\n      10\n        The few cases cited by plaintiffs involve discrimination claims under the\nADA, not the IDEA. See, e.g., Padilla ex rel. Padilla v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 233\nF.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir. 2000) (“Plaintiff . . . alleged that the school district\nand the board of education violated her rights under the ADA by excluding her\nfrom participation in publicly funded general and special education programs\nbased on her disability.”).\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\f      In any event, both claims ultimately fail because the Ellenbergs did not\n\nexhaust the IDEA’s administrative procedures before filing a lawsuit against\n\nNM M I. 11 “As part of the bargain of providing children with educational rights\n\nand parents with procedural safeguards to protect those rights, Congress required\n\nthat parents turn first to the statute’s administrative framew ork to resolve any\n\nconflicts they had with the school’s educational services.” Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe,\n\n297 F.3d at 1064. W e have interpreted the ID EA’s exhaustion requirements\n\nbroadly, noting Congress’ clear intention to allow those with experience in\n\neducating the nation’s disabled children “at least the first crack at formulating a\n\nplan to overcome the consequences of educational shortfalls.” Id. at 1065; see\n\nalso Hayes ex rel. Hayes v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 377, 877 F.2d 809, 814 (10th\n\nCir. 1989) (noting the “philosophy of the [IDEA] is that plaintiffs are required to\n\nutilize the elaborate administrative scheme established by the Act before resorting\n\nto the courts to challenge the actions of the local school authorities”). In\n\naddition, we have recognized the important purposes served by exhaustion,\n\nincluding: (1) “[A]llowing the full development of technical issues and a factual\n\nrecord prior to court review;” (2) “[P]reventing deliberate disregard and\n\ncircumvention of agency procedures established by Congress;” and (3)\n\n\n\n      11\n        This issue w as not resolved by the district court. As always, however,\nwe have an independent obligation to satisfy ourselves of jurisdiction over this\nmatter before addressing the merits of the claim. See Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe v.\nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 12, 297 F.3d 1058, 1063 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                        - 22 -\n\f“[A ]voiding unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency the first\n\nopportunity to correct any error.” Id. (citing Ass’n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v.\n\nTeague, 830 F.2d 158, 160 (11th Cir. 1987)).\n\n      Although they advanced through the state administrative process, plaintiffs\n\nignored two of the IDEA’s most basic initial steps. First, they did not obtain an\n\nIEP from either of S.E.’s undisputed LEAs for the 2003-2004 school year.\n\nCompare Nebo Sch. Dist., 379 F.3d at 970-71. Instead, the Ellenbergs\n\nunilaterally determined that NM M I was their child’s LRE. Second, they did not\n\nrequest a change to S.E.’s then current IEP as prepared by the Taos M unicipal\n\nSchool District for the 2002-2003 academic year. At the time S.E. applied to\n\nNM M I, that IEP stated that because of her behavioral problems and special needs,\n\nCdC was her LRE. If plaintiffs believed S.E. required a new educational\n\nplacement, the proper course would have been for them to request a change to her\n\nIEP. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4). Following that request, should S.E.’s IEP team\n\nnot select NM M I as her educational placement, plaintiffs would have had the\n\nright to challenge that decision via state administrative proceedings.\n\n      Failure to exhaust is excused if the relief plaintiffs seek is not “available”\n\nunder the IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2); Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe, 297 F.3d at\n\n1065. Exhaustion is also not required if pursuing administrative remedies would\n\nbe futile or if “an agency has adopted a policy or pursued a practice of generally\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\f[sic] applicability that is contrary to the law.” Urban ex rel. Urban, 89 F.3d at\n\n724 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 99-296 (1985)).\n\n      Potentially, relief is available to the plaintiffs under the IDEA. Relief is\n\navailable whenever the plaintiff could attain “relief for the events, condition, or\n\nconsequences of which the person complains, not necessarily relief of the kind the\n\nperson prefers.” Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe, 297 F.3d at 1066. The “dispositive\n\nquestion generally is whether the plaintiff has alleged injuries that could be\n\nredressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administrative procedures and remedies.”\n\nPadilla ex rel. Padilla, 233 F.3d at 1274. W e do not determine the availability of\n\nthe relief based on the immediate ability of a plaintiff to attain it, recognizing that\n\n“a child may have to go through several procedural steps to take advantage of that\n\nremedy.” Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe, 297 F.3d at 1066. If “the IDEA’s ability to\n\nremedy a particular injury is unclear, exhaustion should be required . . . . ”\n\nPadilla ex rel. Padilla, 233 F.3d at 1274.\n\n      Although the Ellenbergs characterize the relief they seek as S.E.’s\n\nadmission to NM M I, their only legally cognizable injury under the IDEA is the\n\nstate’s failure to provide their child with a FAPE in the least restrictive\n\nenvironment. They contend that their child’s least restrictive environment is\n\nNM M I, as it is the only place where she can receive a military-style education.\n\nB ecause they have ignored the IDEA’s procedural requirements, however, we\n\nhave no way of deciding whether a military-style education is appropriate for\n\n                                         - 24 -\n\fS.E. 12 Even assuming her LEA may determine that the only way to ensure S.E.\n\nreceives a FAPE is to provide her with such education, they could possibly craft\n\nan IEP incorporating such a program at her local public school. Should her LEA\n\ndetermine that because of S.E.’s specific needs NM M I is her least restrictive\n\nenvironment, New M exico law provides for a referral system w hereby her LEA\n\ncould refer her to NM M I. 13 NM M I, with an updated IEP and a better\n\nunderstanding of S.E.’s education needs, would then be able to make an informed\n\ndecision on whether to admit S.E. based on the LEA’s recommendation.\n\n      W e disagree that requiring the Ellenbergs to request a new IEP from a\n\nchild’s LEA before filing a suit, on the ground that the child is not being given a\n\nFA PE in the least restrictive environment, would be futile and “without logic.”\n\nThe IEP is the “centerpiece of the [IDEA’s] education delivery system.” See\n\nHonig, 484 U.S. at 311. W hen a disabled child alleges that the state is failing to\n\nprovide an education in the LRE, the need for an IEP is especially great. In\n\ndetermining whether an educational placement is a student’s LRE, we look to (1)\n\n\n\n      12\n        W e do not address whether S.E. is entitled to a military-style education\nunder the IDEA. However, it is well-established that the IDEA does not\nguarantee a particular type of substantive education. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at\n207.\n\n      13\n        In addition, under the IDEA an SEA is obligated to “mak[e]\narrangements with public and private institutions (such as a memorandum of\nagreement or special implementation procedures)” to ensure that each child is\ngiven a FAPE in her least restrictive environment. 34 C.F.R. § 300.118.\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\f“whether education in a regular classroom, with the use of supplemental aids and\n\nservices, can be achieved satisfactorily;” and (2) “if not, if the school district has\n\nmainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate.” See Nebo Sch.\n\nDist., 379 F.3d at 976 (citing M urray ex rel. M urray v. M ontrose County Sch.\n\nDist. RE-1J, 51 F.3d 921, 927 n.10 (10th Cir. 1995)). Our review is necessarily\n\nfact-intensive, requiring careful analysis of the particular child’s needs and\n\nabilities. W ithout a recent IEP prepared at the time the placement at NM M I was\n\nrequested, neither this court nor a district court has a factual record adequate to\n\ndetermine if NM M I is appropriate for S.E. See Urban ex rel. Urban, 89 F.3d at\n\n724. 14\n\n          Nor are we persuaded that their claims fall within the general applicability\n\nexception simply because they purport to challenge NM M I’s policies rather than a\n\nspecific IEP prepared for S.E. See Romer, 922 F.2d at 1044. “Administrative\n\nremedies are generally inadequate or futile where plaintiffs allege structural or\n\nsystemic failure and seek systemwide reforms.” Ass’n for Cmty. Living in Colo.,\n\n992 F.2d at 1044. However, in pursuing these claims plaintiffs must show that\n\n\n\n          14\n         Nebo Sch. Dist. does not require a different result. In Nebo Sch. Dist.,\nplaintiffs challenged the placement decision identified in the IEP on the grounds\nthat the selected school, which had a high concentration of disabled students, was\nnot the child’s LRE. See 379 F.3d at 968. W e agreed that, based on the child’s\nIEP, the school district’s proposed placement was not the child’s least restrictive\nenviroment. If anything, Nebo School Dist. highlights the importance of\nobtaining an IEP before initiating litigation over which school constitutes the\nLRE.\n\n                                           - 26 -\n\fthe policies are contrary to the law and that the underlying purposes of exhaustion\n\nwould not be served by requiring procedural compliance. Id. Plaintiffs advance a\n\nplausible argument that NM M I’s refusal to provide special education services to\n\nany student per se infringes upon a child’s right to an education in the LRE.\n\nHowever, as noted above, without an IEP we do not know if NM M I was S.E.’s\n\nleast restrictive environment and thus cannot determine whether her rights under\n\nthe IDEA were violated. 15 Requiring plaintiffs to first pursue administrative\n\nprocedures and remedies is fully consistent w ith purposes of exhaustion. See id.\n\n      Plaintiffs make an ambiguous assertion that “exhausting administrative\n\nremedies against Los Alamos was inconsistent with enforcement of their legal\n\nright to seek admission to NM M I, attend NM M I if admitted, and receive such\n\nspecial education services as a NM M I student.” Nothing precluded S.E. from\n\napplying to NM M I; she applied in M ay 2003. Because she was not admitted to\n\nNM M I, she was not prohibited from attending NM M I following admission or\n\ndenied a FAPE once accepted there.\n\n      Lastly, we reject plaintiffs’ claim that requiring S.E. to obtain an IEP\n\nbefore filing suit is inconsistent with her right to attend NM M I if she is\n\n“otherwise qualified.” S.E. is not entitled to specify which public agency (or\n\n\n\n      15\n         Unlike the plaintiffs in Romer and N .M . Ass’n for Retarded Citizens,\nplaintiffs are not pursuing a class action on behalf of all similarly situated\nchildren. Instead, they bring a claim on behalf of S.E. arguing that her individual\nsubstantive right to an education in the LRE has been violated.\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\fschool for that matter) must provide her FA PE or prepare her IEP. Plaintiffs view\n\nthe IDEA’s substantive guarantee of an education in the LRE as a chit, to be\n\ncashed in at whatever school she wishes to attend. Once again, this misconstrues\n\nthe rights of a disabled student under the IDEA, and once again, plaintiffs\n\narticulate a position for w hich they cite no relevant legal authority.\n\n      It is to the states, not students, that Congress delegated authority to\n\nimplement the IDEA. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207-08. IDEA’s requirements\n\nthat students receive an education in the LRE do not preclude a state from\n\ninitially assigning students to local school districts and requiring them to seek an\n\nIEP from that school district. 16 Although parents are given a right to participate\n\nin the placement decision, states retain “[t]he primary responsibility for\n\nformulating the education to be accorded a handicapped child,” including the\n\nproper educational placement. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 208. Parents may challenge a\n\n      16\n         Plaintiffs appear to argue that because S.E. is within N M M I’s\n“educational jurisdiction,” N M M I must prepare her IEP. Under New M exico law ,\neach “public agency” must adopt rules to ensure that all children within its\neducational jurisdiction are given a FAPE. N.M . Code R. § 6.31.2.9(A). They\ninterpret this provision as follows: Because all New M exico students are entitled\nto apply to NM M I, all N ew M exico students are in its “educational jurisdiction,”\nand thus NM M I is required to create a FAPE for every New M exico student that\nrequests it prepare one. New M exico’s specified structure for IEP preparation\nplaces that burden on LEAs, and NM M I is unquestionably not an LEA under New\nM exico law. If an LEA determines the student requires the services of a state-\neducational agency, which arguably includes N M M I, it may “refer” the student to\nthat agency. N.M . Code R.. § 6.31.2.11(J)(1)(c). Even in that context, the agency\nis not required to immediately accept the student. Plaintiffs’ interpretation of\nNew M exico law is plainly without merit.\n\n\n                                         - 28 -\n\fstate’s proposed IEP, but courts must defer to the state’s proposal if that plan is\n\nreasonably calculated to provide the child with a FAPE in the least restrictive\n\nenvironment, even if a parent believes a different placement would maximize a\n\nchild’s educational potential. See Urban ex rel. Urban, 89 F.3d at 727; Lachman\n\nv. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., 852 F.2d 290, 297 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting students’\n\nclaim that they have a right to choose w here they will receive a FAPE);\n\nSpringdale Sch. Dist. No. 50 v. Grace, 693 F.2d 41, 43 (8th Cir. 1982) (noting\n\nthat even though a state school for the deaf might provide the best possible option\n\nfor a student, the IDEA “does not require states to make available the best\n\npossible option”) (emphasis in original)). W ere plaintiffs’ interpretation of the\n\nLRE provision correct, “much of the ID EA would be unnecessary because all\n\nschool entities (public or private) would be required to make all their programs\n\navailable to all potential students, without regard to suitability, qualifications or\n\nacademic ability.” Ellenberg v. N.M . M ilitary Inst., No. CV -04-00347 PK/DJS,\n\nslip op. at 29 (D.N.M . Feb. 7, 2005). As the district court correctly noted,\n\n“plaintiffs focus on a freestanding substantive guarantee [the right to receive a\n\nFA PE in the least restrictive environment] without concern for the procedural\n\nmechanisms for implementing that guarantee.” Id.\n\n      Because plaintiffs have failed to exhaust the IDEA’s procedural\n\nmechanisms, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment in\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 29 -\n\ffavor of the defendants, and R EM AND to the district court with instructions to\n\ndismiss the Ellenbergs’ IDEA claim for lack of jurisdiction. 17\n\n                                            II\n\n      The Ellenbergs also pursue claims under Title II of the ADA 18 and § 504 of\n\nthe RA. 19 Relying on this circuit’s decision in Urban ex rel. Urban, the district\n\ncourt ruled that because plaintiffs’ claim under the IDEA failed, the ADA and RA\n\n\n\n      17\n         Because w e conclude that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust the ID EA’s\nadministrative procedures before pursuing claims in federal court, we do not\naddress whether under the IDEA NM M I is required to provide special education\nservices to a student who is accepted by, or attends, NM M I.\n\n      18\n           Title II of the ADA provides:\n\n      [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n      disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\n      of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\n      subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. Regulations implementing the ADA prohibit a public agency\nfrom denying a disabled person “the opportunity to participate in services,\nprograms, or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of\npermissibly separate or different programs or activities.” 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(b)(2).\n\n      19\n           Section 504 of the RA provides:\n\n      No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United\n      States, as defined in section 706(20) of this title, shall, solely by\n      reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in,\n      be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n      program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n\n87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\n\n\n                                           - 30 -\n\fclaims must also fail. Ellenberg v. N.M . M ilitary Inst., No. CV-04-00347\n\nPK /DJS, slip op. at 39-40 (D.N.M . Feb. 7, 2005) (citing Urban ex rel. Urban, 89\n\nF.3d at 727-28 (internal citations omitted)). Because we hold that the district\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to address the IDEA claim, the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants on these claims, based solely on its\n\nfinding that the ID EA claim failed, was in error.\n\n       W e must thus determine whether the dismissal of plaintiffs’ IDEA claim for\n\nfailure to exhaust requires us to also dismiss their RA and ADA claims for lack of\n\njurisdiction. W hen a plaintiff pursues a claim under the ADA or other law that\n\nprotects the rights of disabled children, the IDEA “requires her to first exhaust its\n\nadministrative procedures and remedies prior to commencing her ADA suit [or\n\nsuit under other federal law ] if she is ‘seeking relief that is also available under’\n\nthe ID EA.” Padilla ex rel. Padilla, 233 F.3d at 1274 (citation omitted) (emphasis\n\nin original).\n\n       The IDEA permits plaintiffs to file a complaint “with respect to any matter\n\nrelating to . . . the provision of a free appropriate public education.” Hayes ex\n\nrel. Hayes, 877 F.2d at 813 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1)(E)) (emphasis and\n\nomission in original). Thus, we have held that whenever a plaintiff brings a claim\n\nthat is “educational in nature” purporting to challenge the provision of\n\neducational services by a local school district, the claim is “presumptively\n\nredressable” through the IDEA’s administrative procedures. See Padilla ex rel.\n\n                                          - 31 -\n\fPadilla, 233 F.3d at 1275 (listing cases). This holds true regardless of what\n\nstatute the plaintiff purports to cite as the basis for the suit. Id.; Hayes ex rel.\n\nHayes, 877 F.2d at 812 (“In other words, when parents choose to file suit under\n\nanother law that protects the rights of handicapped children-and the suit could\n\nhave been filed under the [IDEA]-they are first required to exhaust the [IDEA’s]\n\nremedies to the same extent as if the suit had been filed originally under the\n\n[IDEA’s] provisions.”) (internal citation omitted). The benefits of exhaustion\n\nfully support this rule, as it allow s educational professionals to have the first\n\ncrack at designing a program to meet a disabled student’s specific needs.\n\n       Arguably, plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims are “educational in nature” as\n\nthey seek resolution of a dispute involving the admission requirements and\n\npractices of NM M I, a secondary school. Based on our broad interpretation of the\n\nterm available, see Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe, 297 F.3d at 1066 (citing Padilla ex rel.\n\nPadilla, 233 F.3d at 1274), the thrust of the relief the Ellenbergs requested under\n\n§ 504 could be obtained through the IDEA and thus is presumptively redressable\n\nby its provisions. 20   However, the presumption regarding exhaustion is simply\n\n\n\n       20\n          Specifically, they seek: (1) reversal of the administrative appeal officer\nand hearing officer’s decisions, (2) a declaratory judgment that NM M I is bound\nby the IDEA and § 504, (3) an injunction requiring NM M I to begin complying\nwith its obligations under the IDEA and § 504, (4) damages for the discrimination\nsuffered by S.E. pursuant to § 504 and the ADA, (5) compensatory education, (6)\ndamages for her lost educational opportunity, and (7) attorney fees and costs as\nallow ed by state law .\n\n\n                                          - 32 -\n\fthat, a presumption, and with respect to certain claims presented here, plaintiffs\n\nhave overcome it.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that NM M I unlaw fully discriminated against S.E. in\n\nviolation of the RA and the ADA by denying her admission on the basis of her\n\ndisability even though she w as “otherw ise qualified” to attend, and that NM M I’s\n\nqualifying admissions standards are “facially discriminatory.” 21 In the context of\n\nthese pure discrimination claims, the ID EA offers no relief, for they do not relate\n\nto the provision of a FAPE in the least restrictive environment. Instead, they\n\nchallenge the alleged discriminatory admissions practices of a state-funded\n\n\n\n      21\n          The district court found that plaintiffs’ claims under the IDEA, the RA,\nand the ADA were essentially indistinguishable. W e understand the district\ncourt’s frustration with plaintiffs, and recognize that their complaint and\nsubsequent briefing did not provide the clearest articulation of the unique\ndifferences between the ID EA, the RA, and the ADA claims they assert.\nArguably this failure below stemmed from plaintiffs’ understanding that the\ndistrict court precluded them from presenting their arguments regarding the RA\nand the ADA in its scheduling order requesting briefing on the ID EA claims, a\nposition the Ellenbergs argued in their opening submission to the district court.\n       Nevertheless, plaintiffs pled allegations sufficient to establish the separate\nand distinct nature of the RA and ADA claims. For example, in paragraph 12 of\nthe complaint, they allege that NM M I “had a written policy of excluding students\nwith disabilities from admission to NM M I.” In paragraph 13, they contend that\nthis policy was discriminatory. In paragraph 36, they note that NM M I engaged in\ndiscrimination by refusing to admit S.E. During a hearing before the district\ncourt, NM M I’s counsel recognized that plaintiffs w ere raising separate\ndiscrimination claims under § 504 and the A DA. In that same hearing, plaintiffs’\ncounsel stated that the “Section 504 and ADA claims would stand alone” from the\nID EA claim, but that such claims do not stand alone for purposes of state\nadministrative procedures because “if there are no IDEA claims, a family does not\nhave the power to file a Section 504 administrative grievance” with NM PED.\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\fsecondary school. As we noted previously, the Supreme Court has long-\n\nrecognized that the ID EA is simply not an anti-discrimination statute.\n\n      M oreover, exempting plaintiffs from exhaustion in this circumstance\n\nprevents inefficiency and waste of judicial resources. Limited obligations are\n\nimposed on states under the IDEA. Educational experts who develop IEPs must\n\nidentify the students’ LRE and select an educational placement, but they do not\n\ndecide which schools a student is otherw ise qualified to attend. Administrative\n\nofficers reviewing plaintiffs’ IDEA claims must consider the same limited\n\nquestions that we ask: (1) Has the student been given a FAPE?; and (2) W as the\n\nstudent given a FAPE in the least restrictive environment? Rowley, 450 U.S. at\n\n206-07. At no point would the administrative process offer insight into the merits\n\nof a discrimination claim. Requiring exhaustion before the Ellenbergs could\n\npursue their claims under the ADA and RA would create an anomolous result:\n\nPlaintiffs who concede a students’ IDEA rights have not been violated, or have\n\nsettled the IDEA claims, would be required to craft an IDEA claim and proceed\n\nthrough the state administrative process to determine if the students’ ID EA rights\n\nhave been violated. See W .B. v. M atula, 67 F.3d 484, 496 (3d Cir. 1995)\n\n(recognizing that plaintiffs would not be required to use the ID EA’s\n\nadministrative framew ork w hen they have settled their IDEA claims).\n\n       Turning to the merits of the RA and ADA claims, contrary to N M M I’s\n\nsuggestion, our precedent does not hold that a party’s discrimination claims under\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\fthe RA and the ADA must automatically be dismissed if an IDEA claim fails. 22\n\n      22\n          Both NM M I and the district court cited this court’s decision in Urban ex\nrel. Urban for the proposition that if the state provides a student with a FAPE in\nthe least restrictive environment, it has not violated § 504 or the ADA. In Urban\nex rel. Urban, plaintiff argued that he was entitled under the ADA to reject the\neducational placement offered by the school district and attend his neighborhood\nschool. This court noted that the administrative regulations promulgated by the\nDepartment of Education pursuant to § 504 “generally conform to the standards\nestablished by the IDEA.” 89 F.3d at 728. Both regulations “use substantially\nthe same language regarding a school district’s obligation to evaluate each\ndisabled child, create an IEP with parental input, and provide each disabled child\nwith an appropriate education.” Id. Thus, we concluded that “if a disabled child\nis not entitled to a neighborhood placement under the ID EA, he is not entitled to\nsuch a placement under section 504.” Id. However, we specifically noted that “a\nfederally-funded education system may violate § 504 when the school system’s\npractices ‘preclude the handicapped from obtaining system benefits realized by\nthe nonhandicapped.’” Id. (citing N.M . Ass’n for Retarded Citizens, 678 F.2d at\n855) (emphasis in original); see also W eber v. Cranston Pub. Sch. Comm’n, 245\nF. Supp. 2d 401, 406 (D.R.I. 2003) (noting that § 504 is a “bludgeon to the\nID EA’s stiletto”).\n       Adopting NM M I’s reading of Urban ex rel. Urban would also contradict\nCongress’ express legislative mandate that the ID EA should not be “construed to\nrestrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the\nConstitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children\nwith disabilities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). At least one scholar has provided a clear\narticulation of the interplay between claims under the IDEA and those brought\npursuant to § 504:\n\n      In contrast to the IDEA, Section 504 emphasizes equal treatment, not\n      just access to a FAPE. In other words, the drafters of Section 504\n      were not only concerned with [a student] receiving a FAPE\n      somewhere (as w as the case with the ID EA), but also that a federally\n      funded program does not treat [the student] differently because [she\n      is disabled]. Under Section 504, a state special school cannot hide\n      behind the justification that another public school might provide a\n      FA PE; it must show that somehow [the student] does not qualify for\n      admission. Unlike the IDEA, Section 504 does not only look at what\n      is a FAPE, but also what is fair.\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                       - 35 -\n\fAny other interpretation of our caselaw would mean that a state educational\n\ninstitution that receives public funding could openly discriminate against\n\napplicants with disabilities so long as the state offered the student a FAPE in the\n\nleast restrictive environment. Thus, even if plaintiffs conceded that New M exico\n\nfully satisfied its IDEA obligations with respect to S.E., they could pursue claims\n\nunder the ADA and the RA on the grounds that S.E. was precluded from receiving\n\na state benefit – military-style education – provided to her non-disabled peers.\n\n      Because the district court failed to consider these claims independently\n\nfrom the IDEA claim, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on the ADA and RA claims, and REM AND for reconsideration of these\n\nclaims.\n\n                                         IV\n\n      Accordingly, we REV ER SE the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of NM M I on the IDEA claim, and REM AND with instructions to dismiss\n\nthat claim for lack of jurisdiction.

The district court's sole basis for granting summary judgment to NMMI on these claims was that plaintiffs' IDEA claim failed.

Stat. &#167; 22-1-2(R). Throughout this litigation, NMMI has taken the position that it is also not bound by the IDEA. Nonetheless, NMMI contends it has admitted disabled applicants as long as they are \"otherwise qualified,\" but will not alter its programs to accommodate those with special needs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.E. is the child of Bob and Karen Ellenberg. In late 2000 S.E. moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico to live with her father, after exhibiting significant behavioral problems while living with her mother in Florida. Unfortunately, S.E.'s problems worsened in New Mexico, where she engaged in high-risk activities, including the abuse of various illegal drugs. When plaintiffs enrolled S.E. at Los Alamos High School (\"LAHS\"), the public high school serving her school district, they informed school officials about her problems and requested that S.E. be closely monitored. The Ellenbergs did not, however, request that LAHS provide S.E. with special education services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Soon after she started attending LAHS, S.E. stole her parents' car and credit card, prompting the exasperated Ellenbergs to press charges against her. During subsequent court proceedings related to that incident, S.E. received a \"Waiver of Time Limitation,\" under which all charges would be dismissed if she satisfied certain conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of those conditions was placement in a court-ordered residential treatment program. S.E. was assigned to Casa de Corazon (\"CdC\"), a treatment facility located in Taos, New Mexico. In November 2002, the Taos Municipal School District evaluated S.E. and concluded she qualified for special education services on the basis of an emotional disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It accordingly prepared an IEP for her, which recommended both a course of study&#8212;S.E. was to receive high school curriculum&#8212;and a behavioral intervention plan. LAHS was identified in the IEP as S.E.'s public high school based on her residency, but because of her behavioral and social problems the IEP recommended residential treatment elsewhere. Specifically, the IEP team determined that S.E. needed a \"small, structured learning environment\" and \"careful monitoring.\" CdC, with a professional staff trained to address her unique needs, was thus identified as her LRE. The IEP was to be reviewed one year from the date it was created or at the time of her discharge, whichever occurred first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.E. (then fifteen) anticipated being discharged from CdC during the summer following the 2002-2003 school year. Rather than requesting an IEP for the upcoming school year from either the Los Alamos School District or the Taos Municipal School District, her undisputed LEAs for IDEA purposes, the Ellenbergs allowed S.E. to apply directly to NMMI for the fall 2003 semester. In her application packet, the Ellenbergs disclosed that S.E. had previously exhibited \"a lot of disciplinary problems,\" was currently enrolled in a residential treatment program in Taos, was diagnosed with ODD, and was taking medication to control her behavioral problems. They noted, however, that S.E. was now determined to change her ways and showed signs of progress on that front. S.E. also included a personal letter outlining her reasons for seeking admission: She \"want[s] a good education, and want[s] to be in the military.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2003 NMMI notified the Ellenbergs that S.E. would not be admitted for the fall semester, but would be considered for the winter semester if she demonstrated an ability to succeed in a regular classroom setting. Dissatisfied with that decision, plaintiffs submitted personal letters and testimonials from two of S.E.'s treating therapists at CdC. Although the therapists corroborated plaintiffs' belief that S.E. showed signs of improvement, they noted that S.E.'s difficulties with anger and authority persisted. One therapist recommended that S.E. start at NMMI in August, opining that S.E.'s continued need for a \"structured learning environment\" would be satisfied at NMMI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these efforts, NMMI upheld its decision based on (1) S.E.'s presence in CdC, (2) her admitted past drug use, (3) her present medication requirements, and (4) her need for continued counseling. Again, NMMI suggested that S.E. reapply for the winter semester after demonstrating the ability to succeed in \"an educational environment other than a Residential Treatment Facility.\" The Ellenbergs opted to pursue an alternate approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Days later, they filed a request with NMPED for an IDEA administrative due process hearing against NMMI. Plaintiffs argued NMMI's refusal to provide S.E. with a FAPE violated her rights under the IDEA and &#167; 504 of the RA. When NMPED assigned a hearing officer to address the claim, NMMI entered a limited appearance solely for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction. NMMI posited that because it is not a \"public school or agency\" it is not bound by the provisions of the IDEA or &#167; 504 of the RA. The hearing officer found against NMMI on the jurisdictional question, but ultimately ruled in favor of NMMI on the merits. She concluded that NMMI was not required to provide S.E. with a FAPE under the IDEA or the RA because plaintiffs failed to show S.E. was otherwise qualified to attend NMMI. Both parties filed administrative appeals: NMMI contested the jurisdictional finding; plaintiffs challenged the ruling that S.E. was not otherwise qualified. Concluding that the hearing officer wrongly decided that NMMI was a \"public school or agency\" bound by the IDEA and the RA, the administrative appeals officer dismissed plaintiffs' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Their IDEA claim, the appeals officer noted, \"borders on being wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ellenbergs then filed a civil action in federal court against NMMI asserting claims under the IDEA, &#167; 504 of the RA, and Title II of the ADA. Although it recognized \"exhaustion concerns\" due to plaintiffs' failure to obtain an IEP from an LEA before filing suit, the district court proceeded to address the merits. It first rejected the IDEA claim, interpreting plaintiffs' argument under the IDEA as follows: The IDEA provides students with the right to choose where they will receive a FAPE, i.e., which school is the student's least restrictive environment, and thus S.E. has a right to choose to receive a FAPE from NMMI. In its order, the court found that nothing within the IDEA's provisions cited by plaintiffs \"support[s] the theory that special education is merely a service that must be provided wherever the student chooses to attend school.\" <i>See Ellenberg v. N.M. Military Inst.,</i> No. CV-04-00347 PK/DJS, slip. op. at 28 (D.N.M. February 7, 2005). Its findings expressly noted, however, that the court was not addressing whether \"NMMI must provide a FAPE for a child with a disability admitted to NMMI.\" Relying on this circuit's decision in <i>Urban ex rel. Urban v. Jefferson County Sch. Dist. R-1,</i> 89 F.3d 720 (10th Cir.1996), the court also granted summary judgment to NMMI on the ADA and the RA claims, finding that if the state satisfied its obligations under the IDEA it was not required to do more under the ADA or the RA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard employed by the district court. <i>See L.B. ex rel.

Dist.:</i> The IDEA sets up a unique standard for a federal court's review of the administrative due process hearing. A district court applies a modified <i>de novo</i> standard in reviewing a hearing officer's decision under the IDEA. It looks at the record of the administrative proceedings and decides, based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the requirements of the IDEA are met. In so doing, it must give \"due weight\" to the hearing officer's findings of fact, which are considered <i>prima facie</i> correct. Although the district court may accept additional evidence, such evidence is merely supplemental to the administrative record. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . Because the IDEA requires a district court to grant a judgment on the record based on its own ascertainment of the preponderance of the evidence, many IDEA claims do not fit into the typical summary judgment standard of \"no genuine issues of material fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 973-74 (internal citations omitted).

They do not claim that either the Los Alamos or Taos Municipal School Districts &#8212;S.E.'s LEAs&#8212;were unable to provide her with a FAPE. <i>Compare O'Toole ex rel. O'Toole,</i> 144 F.3d at 695. Nor do they claim that S.E. was denied a FAPE or appropriate reimbursement following her admission to NMMI, <i>compare Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter,</i> 510 U.S. 7, 114 S.Ct. 361, 126 L.Ed.2d 284 (1993), because S.E. was never admitted to NMMI. Notably, this is not a suit brought against the State of New Mexico, the Governor, or the head of NMPED, arguing that NMMI's failure to offer special education services (1) violates New Mexico's obligation under the IDEA to have a goal of full educational equality, or (2) categorically denies S.E. a FAPE in the least restrictive environment by limiting the continuum of placements her LEAs may consider. <i>Compare Ass'n for Cmty.

In their brief, which relies heavily on anti-discrimination hyperbole, they view the IDEA as a virtual treasure trove providing disabled children with a limitless number of substantive rights. The IDEA, however, is not so broad. It is a spending statute that imposes obligations on the states to provide certain benefits in exchange for federal funds. <i>See Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 204 n. 26, 102 S.Ct. 3034. Although \"Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States, . . . when Congress attaches conditions to a State's acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must be set out `unambiguously.'\" <i>Arlington Cent.

Courts engage in a two-step inquiry to determine if a state has satisfied its substantive IDEA obligations. \"First, has the State complied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And second, is the individualized educational program developed through the Act's procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits?\" <i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 206-07, 102 S.Ct. 3034.

At the time S.E. applied to NMMI, that IEP stated that because of her behavioral problems and special needs, CdC was her LRE. If plaintiffs believed S.E. required a new educational placement, the proper course would have been for them to request a change to her IEP. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1414(d)(4).

They contend that their child's least restrictive environment is NMMI, as it is the only place where she can receive a military-style education. Because they have ignored the IDEA's procedural requirements, however, we have no way of deciding whether a military-style education is appropriate for S.E.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Even assuming her LEA may determine that the only way to ensure S.E. receives a FAPE is to provide her with such education, they could possibly craft an IEP incorporating such a program at her local public school.

When a disabled child alleges that the state is failing to provide an education in the LRE, the need for an IEP is especially great. In determining whether an educational placement is a student's LRE, we look to (1) \"whether education in a regular classroom, with the use of supplemental aids and services, can be achieved satisfactorily;\" and (2) \"if not, if the school district has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate.\" <i>See Nebo Sch.

Our review is necessarily fact-intensive, requiring careful analysis of the particular child's needs and abilities. Without a recent IEP prepared at the time the placement at NMMI was requested, neither this court nor a district court has a factual record adequate to determine if NMMI is appropriate for S.E. <i>See Urban ex rel.

However, in pursuing these claims plaintiffs must show that the policies are contrary to the law and that the underlying purposes of exhaustion would not be served by requiring procedural compliance. <i>Id.</i> Plaintiffs advance a plausible argument that NMMI's refusal to provide special education services to any student per se infringes upon a child's right to an education in the LRE. However, as noted above, without an IEP we do not know if NMMI was S.E.'s least restrictive environment and thus cannot determine whether her rights under the IDEA were violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Requiring plaintiffs to first pursue administrative procedures and remedies is fully consistent with purposes of exhaustion. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs make an ambiguous assertion that \"exhausting administrative remedies against Los Alamos was inconsistent with enforcement of their legal right to seek admission to NMMI, attend NMMI if admitted, and receive such special education services as a NMMI student.\" Nothing precluded S.E. from applying to NMMI; she applied in May 2003.

Plaintiffs view the IDEA's substantive guarantee of an education in the LRE as a chit, to be cashed in at whatever school she wishes to attend.

Parents may challenge a state's proposed IEP, but courts must defer to the state's proposal if that plan is reasonably calculated to provide the child with a FAPE in the least restrictive environment, even if a parent believes a different placement would maximize a child's educational potential. <i>See Urban ex rel.

When a plaintiff pursues a claim under the ADA or other law that protects the rights of disabled children, the IDEA \"requires her to first exhaust its administrative procedures and remedies prior to commencing her ADA suit [or suit under other federal law] if she is <i>`seeking relief that is also available under'</i> the IDEA.\" <i>Padilla ex rel.

Thus, we have held that whenever a plaintiff brings a claim that is \"educational in nature\" purporting to challenge the provision of educational services by a local school district, the claim is \"presumptively redressable\" through the IDEA's administrative procedures. <i>See Padilla ex rel. Padilla,</i> 233 F.3d at 1275 (listing cases). This holds true regardless of what statute the plaintiff purports to cite as the basis for the suit. <i>Id.; Hayes ex rel.

Based on our broad interpretation of the term available, <i>see Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe,</i> 297 F.3d at 1066 (<i>citing Padilla ex rel. Padilla,</i> 233 F.3d at 1274), the thrust of the relief the Ellenbergs requested under &#167; 504 could be obtained through the IDEA and thus is presumptively redressable by its provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> However, the presumption regarding exhaustion is simply that, a presumption, and with respect to certain claims presented here, plaintiffs have overcome it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that NMMI unlawfully discriminated against S.E. in violation of the RA and the ADA by denying her admission on the basis of her disability even though she was \"otherwise qualified\" to attend, and that NMMI's qualifying admissions standards are \"facially discriminatory.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> In the context of these pure discrimination claims, the IDEA offers no relief, for they do not relate to the provision of a FAPE in the least restrictive environment.

At no point would the administrative process offer insight into the merits of a discrimination claim. Requiring exhaustion before the Ellenbergs could pursue their claims under the ADA and RA would create an anomalous result: Plaintiffs who concede a students' IDEA rights have not been violated, or have settled the IDEA claims, would be required to craft an IDEA claim and proceed through the state administrative process to determine if the students' IDEA rights have been violated. <i>See W.B. v.

They interpret this provision as follows: Because all New Mexico students are entitled to apply to NMMI, all New Mexico students are in its \"educational jurisdiction,\" and thus NMMI is required to create a FAPE for every New Mexico student that requests it prepare one. New Mexico's specified structure for IEP preparation places that burden on LEAs, and NMMI is unquestionably not an LEA under New Mexico law.

For example, in paragraph 12 of the complaint, they allege that NMMI \"had a written policy of excluding students with disabilities from admission to NMMI.\" In paragraph 13, they contend that this policy was discriminatory. In paragraph 36, they note that NMMI engaged in discrimination by refusing to admit S.E. During a hearing before the district court, NMMI's counsel recognized that plaintiffs were raising separate discrimination claims under &#167; 504 and the ADA. In that same hearing, plaintiffs' counsel stated that the \"Section 504 and ADA claims would stand alone\" from the IDEA claim, but that such claims do not stand alone for purposes of state administrative procedures because \"if there are no IDEA claims, a family does not have the power to file a Section 504 administrative grievance\" with NMPED.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Both NMMI and the district court cited this court's decision in<i>Urban ex rel.

Urban,</i> plaintiff argued that he was entitled under the ADA to reject the educational placement offered by the school district and attend his neighborhood school. This court noted that the administrative regulations promulgated by the Department of Education pursuant to &#167; 504 \"generally conform to the standards established by the IDEA.\" 89 F.3d at 728. Both regulations \"use substantially the same language regarding a school district's obligation to evaluate each disabled child, create an IEP with parental input, and provide each disabled child with an appropriate education.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, we concluded that \"if a disabled child is not entitled to a neighborhood placement under the IDEA, he is not entitled to such a placement under section 504.\" <i>Id.</i> However, we specifically noted that \"a federally-funded education system may violate &#167; 504 when the school system's practices `<i>preclude</i> the handicapped from obtaining system benefits realized by the nonhandicapped.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>N.M.

In other words, the drafters of Section 504 were not only concerned with [a student] receiving a FAPE somewhere (as was the case with the IDEA), but also that a federally funded program does not treat [the student] differently because [she is disabled].

They argued that NMMI's denial of their child's application for admission violated all three statutes, and sought a declaration from the district court that NMMI is bound by the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IDEA requires states that accept federal special education funds to provide disabled children with a \"free appropriate public education\" (\"FAPE\") in the \"least restrictive environment\" (\"LRE\"). It guarantees that such an education is given by instructing states to create an Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") for each child within its care. As part of the bargain, however, Congress requires parents to exhaust IDEA's administrative procedures and remedies before filing suit in federal court. The district court questioned whether the Ellenbergs satisfied this mandate, but nonetheless addressed the merits of the IDEA claim.

Because it is undisputed that plaintiffs never attempted to amend their child's existing IEP or obtain a new IEP before pursuing the IDEA claim, they have failed to exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures and remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our precedent, parties are precluded from bringing claims under the ADA and the RA that are educational in nature if they have failed to exhaust IDEA's administrative procedures, and relief for their injuries is available under the IDEA. Although we hold that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust IDEA's administrative procedures, they are unable to obtain relief under the IDEA for their pure discrimination claims brought pursuant to the RA and ADA, and thus are not barred from bringing these claims in federal court at this time. The district court's sole basis for granting summary judgment to NMMI on these claims was that plaintiffs' IDEA claim failed. Because plaintiffs' claims under the RA and ADA are separate and distinct from the IDEA claim, the district court's ruling in favor of NMMI on this basis was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, REVERSE the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of NMMI on the IDEA claim, and REMAND with instructions to dismiss that claim for lack of jurisdiction.

Stat. &#167; 22-1-2(R). Throughout this litigation, NMMI has taken the position that it is also not bound by the IDEA. Nonetheless, NMMI contends it has admitted disabled applicants as long as they are \"otherwise qualified,\" but will not alter its programs to accommodate those with special needs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.E. is the child of Bob and Karen Ellenberg. In late 2000 S.E. moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico to live with her father, after exhibiting significant behavioral problems while living with her mother in Florida. Unfortunately, S.E.'s problems worsened in New Mexico, where she engaged in high-risk activities, including the abuse of various illegal drugs. When plaintiffs enrolled S.E. at Los Alamos High School (\"LAHS\"), the public high school serving her school district, they informed school officials about her problems and requested that S.E. be closely monitored. The Ellenbergs did not, however, request that LAHS provide S.E. with special education services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Soon after she started attending LAHS, S.E. stole her parents' car and credit card, prompting the exasperated Ellenbergs to press charges against her. During subsequent court proceedings related to that incident, S.E. received a \"Waiver of Time Limitation,\" under which all charges would be dismissed if she satisfied certain conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of those conditions was placement in a court-ordered residential treatment program. S.E. was assigned to Casa de Corazon (\"CdC\"), a treatment facility located in Taos, New Mexico. In November 2002, the Taos Municipal School District evaluated S.E. and concluded she qualified for special education services on the basis of an emotional disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It accordingly prepared an IEP for her, which recommended both a course of study&#8212;S.E. was to receive high school curriculum&#8212;and a behavioral intervention plan. LAHS was identified in the IEP as S.E.'s public high school based on her residency, but because of her behavioral and social problems the IEP recommended residential treatment elsewhere. Specifically, the IEP team determined that S.E. needed a \"small, structured learning environment\" and \"careful monitoring.\" CdC, with a professional staff trained to address her unique needs, was thus identified as her LRE. The IEP was to be reviewed one year from the date it was created or at the time of her discharge, whichever occurred first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.E. (then fifteen) anticipated being discharged from CdC during the summer following the 2002-2003 school year. Rather than requesting an IEP for the upcoming school year from either the Los Alamos School District or the Taos Municipal School District, her undisputed LEAs for IDEA purposes, the Ellenbergs allowed S.E. to apply directly to NMMI for the fall 2003 semester. In her application packet, the Ellenbergs disclosed that S.E. had previously exhibited \"a lot of disciplinary problems,\" was currently enrolled in a residential treatment program in Taos, was diagnosed with ODD, and was taking medication to control her behavioral problems. They noted, however, that S.E. was now determined to change her ways and showed signs of progress on that front. S.E. also included a personal letter outlining her reasons for seeking admission: She \"want[s] a good education, and want[s] to be in the military.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2003 NMMI notified the Ellenbergs that S.E. would not be admitted for the fall semester, but would be considered for the winter semester if she demonstrated an ability to succeed in a regular classroom setting. Dissatisfied with that decision, plaintiffs submitted personal letters and testimonials from two of S.E.'s treating therapists at CdC. Although the therapists corroborated plaintiffs' belief that S.E. showed signs of improvement, they noted that S.E.'s difficulties with anger and authority persisted. One therapist recommended that S.E. start at NMMI in August, opining that S.E.'s continued need for a \"structured learning environment\" would be satisfied at NMMI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these efforts, NMMI upheld its decision based on (1) S.E.'s presence in CdC, (2) her admitted past drug use, (3) her present medication requirements, and (4) her need for continued counseling. Again, NMMI suggested that S.E. reapply for the winter semester after demonstrating the ability to succeed in \"an educational environment other than a Residential Treatment Facility.\" The Ellenbergs opted to pursue an alternate approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Days later, they filed a request with NMPED for an IDEA administrative due process hearing against NMMI. Plaintiffs argued NMMI's refusal to provide S.E. with a FAPE violated her rights under the IDEA and &#167; 504 of the RA. When NMPED assigned a hearing officer to address the claim, NMMI entered a limited appearance solely for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction. NMMI posited that because it is not a \"public school or agency\" it is not bound by the provisions of the IDEA or &#167; 504 of the RA. The hearing officer found against NMMI on the jurisdictional question, but ultimately ruled in favor of NMMI on the merits. She concluded that NMMI was not required to provide S.E. with a FAPE under the IDEA or the RA because plaintiffs failed to show S.E. was otherwise qualified to attend NMMI. Both parties filed administrative appeals: NMMI contested the jurisdictional finding; plaintiffs challenged the ruling that S.E. was not otherwise qualified. Concluding that the hearing officer wrongly decided that NMMI was a \"public school or agency\" bound by the IDEA and the RA, the administrative appeals officer dismissed plaintiffs' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Their IDEA claim, the appeals officer noted, \"borders on being wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ellenbergs then filed a civil action in federal court against NMMI asserting claims under the IDEA, &#167; 504 of the RA, and Title II of the ADA. Although it recognized \"exhaustion concerns\" due to plaintiffs' failure to obtain an IEP from an LEA before filing suit, the district court proceeded to address the merits. It first rejected the IDEA claim, interpreting plaintiffs' argument under the IDEA as follows: The IDEA provides students with the right to choose where they will receive a FAPE, i.e., which school is the student's least restrictive environment, and thus S.E. has a right to choose to receive a FAPE from NMMI. In its order, the court found that nothing within the IDEA's provisions cited by plaintiffs \"support[s] the theory that special education is merely a service that must be provided wherever the student chooses to attend school.\" <i>See Ellenberg v. N.M. Military Inst.,</i> No. CV-04-00347 PK/DJS, slip. op. at 28 (D.N.M. February 7, 2005). Its findings expressly noted, however, that the court was not addressing whether \"NMMI must provide a FAPE for a child with a disability admitted to NMMI.\" Relying on this circuit's decision in <i>Urban ex rel.

That standard was described in detail in <i>Nebo Sch. Dist.:</i> The IDEA sets up a unique standard for a federal court's review of the administrative due process hearing. A district court applies a modified <i>de novo</i> standard in reviewing a hearing officer's decision under the IDEA.

In so doing, it must give \"due weight\" to the hearing officer's findings of fact, which are considered <i>prima facie</i> correct.

First, they did not obtain an IEP from either of S.E.'s undisputed LEAs for the 2003-2004 school year. <i>Compare Nebo Sch. Dist.,</i> 379 F.3d at 970-71. Instead, the Ellenbergs unilaterally determined that NMMI was their child's LRE. Second, they did not request a change to S.E.'s then current IEP as prepared by the Taos Municipal School District for the 2002-2003 academic year. At the time S.E. applied to NMMI, that IEP stated that because of her behavioral problems and special needs, CdC was her LRE. If plaintiffs believed S.E. required a new educational placement, the proper course would have been for them to request a change to her IEP. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1414(d)(4). Following that request, should S.E.'s IEP team not select NMMI as her educational placement, plaintiffs would have had the right to challenge that decision via state administrative proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to exhaust is excused if the relief plaintiffs seek is not \"available\" under the IDEA. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2); <i>Cudjoe ex rel.

The \"dispositive question generally is whether the plaintiff has alleged injuries that could be redressed to any degree by the IDEA's administrative procedures and remedies.\" <i>Padilla ex rel. Padilla,</i> 233 F.3d at 1274. We do not determine the availability of the relief based on the immediate ability of a plaintiff to attain it, recognizing that \"a child may have to go through several procedural steps to take advantage of that remedy.\" <i>Cudjoe ex rel.

They contend that their child's least restrictive environment is NMMI, as it is the only place where she can receive a military-style education. Because they have ignored the IDEA's procedural requirements, however, we have no way of deciding whether a military-style education is appropriate for S.E.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Even assuming her LEA may determine that the only way to ensure S.E. receives a FAPE is to provide her with such education, they could possibly craft an IEP incorporating such a program at her local public school. Should her LEA determine that because of S.E.'s specific needs NMMI is her least restrictive environment, New Mexico law provides for a referral system whereby her LEA could refer her to NMMI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> NMMI, with an updated IEP and a better understanding of S.E.'s education needs, would then be able to make an informed decision on whether to admit S.E. based on the LEA's recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that requiring the Ellenbergs to request a new IEP from a child's LEA before filing a suit, on the ground that the child is not being given a FAPE in the least restrictive environment, would be futile and \"without logic.\" The IEP is the \"centerpiece of the [IDEA's] education delivery system.\" <i>See Honig,</i> 484 U.S. at 311, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111982\"><a href=\"/opinion/111982/honig-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In determining whether an educational placement is a student's LRE, we look to (1) \"whether education in a regular classroom, with the use of supplemental aids and services, can be achieved satisfactorily;\" and (2) \"if not, if the school district has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate.\" <i>See Nebo Sch.

Our review is necessarily fact-intensive, requiring careful analysis of the particular child's needs and abilities. Without a recent IEP prepared at the time the placement at NMMI was requested, neither this court nor a district court has a factual record adequate to determine if NMMI is appropriate for S.E. <i>See Urban ex rel.

Living in Colo.,</i> 992 F.2d at 1044. However, in pursuing these claims plaintiffs must show that the policies are contrary to the law and that the underlying purposes of exhaustion would not be served by requiring procedural compliance. <i>Id.</i> Plaintiffs advance a plausible argument that NMMI's refusal to provide special education services to any student per se infringes upon a child's right to an education in the LRE. However, as noted above, without an IEP we do not know if NMMI was S.E.'s least restrictive environment and thus cannot determine whether her rights under the IDEA were violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Requiring plaintiffs to first pursue administrative procedures and remedies is fully consistent with purposes of exhaustion. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs make an ambiguous assertion that \"exhausting administrative remedies against Los Alamos was inconsistent with enforcement of their legal right to seek admission to NMMI, attend NMMI if admitted, and receive such special education services as a NMMI student.\" Nothing precluded S.E. from applying to NMMI; she applied in May 2003.

Plaintiffs view the IDEA's substantive guarantee of an education in the LRE as a chit, to be cashed in at whatever school she wishes to attend.

When a plaintiff pursues a claim under the ADA or other law that protects the rights of disabled children, the IDEA \"requires her to first exhaust its administrative procedures and remedies prior to commencing her ADA suit [or suit under other federal law] if she is <i>`seeking relief that is also available under'</i> the IDEA.\" <i>Padilla ex rel.

Thus, we have held that whenever a plaintiff brings a claim that is \"educational in nature\" purporting to challenge the provision of educational services by a local school district, the claim is \"presumptively redressable\" through the IDEA's administrative procedures. <i>See Padilla ex rel. Padilla,</i> 233 F.3d at 1275 (listing cases). This holds true regardless of what statute the plaintiff purports to cite as the basis for the suit. <i>Id.; Hayes ex rel. Hayes,</i> 877 F.2d at 812 (\"In other words, when parents choose to file suit under another law that protects the rights of handicapped children-and the suit could have been filed under the [IDEA]-they are first required to exhaust the [IDEA's] remedies to the same extent as if the suit had been filed originally under the [IDEA's] provisions.\") (internal citation omitted).

Based on our broad interpretation of the term available, <i>see Cudjoe ex rel. Cudjoe,</i> 297 F.3d at 1066 (<i>citing Padilla ex rel. Padilla,</i> 233 F.3d at 1274), the thrust of the relief the Ellenbergs requested under &#167; 504 could be obtained through the IDEA and thus is presumptively redressable by its provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> However, the presumption regarding exhaustion is simply that, a presumption, and with respect to certain claims presented here, plaintiffs have overcome it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that NMMI unlawfully discriminated against S.E. in violation of the RA and the ADA by denying her admission on the basis of her disability even though she was \"otherwise qualified\" to attend, and that NMMI's qualifying admissions standards are \"facially discriminatory.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> In the context of these pure discrimination claims, the IDEA offers no relief, for they do not relate to the provision of a FAPE in the least restrictive environment. Instead, they challenge the alleged discriminatory admissions practices of a state-funded secondary school.

Limited obligations are imposed on states under the IDEA. Educational experts who develop IEPs must identify the students' LRE and select an educational placement, but they do not decide which schools a student is otherwise qualified to attend. Administrative officers reviewing plaintiffs' IDEA claims must consider the same limited questions that we ask: (1) Has the student been given a FAPE?; and (2) Was the student given a FAPE in the least restrictive environment? <i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 206-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We agreed that, based on the child's IEP, the school district's proposed placement was not the child's least restrictive environment.

Under New Mexico law, each \"public agency\" must adopt rules to ensure that all children within its educational jurisdiction are given a FAPE. N.M.Code R. &#167; 6.31.2.9(A). They interpret this provision as follows: Because all New Mexico students are entitled to apply to NMMI, all New Mexico students are in its \"educational jurisdiction,\" and thus NMMI is required to create a FAPE for every New Mexico student that requests it prepare one. New Mexico's specified structure for IEP preparation places that burden on LEAs, and NMMI is unquestionably not an LEA under New Mexico law. If an LEA determines the student requires the services of a state-educational agency, which arguably includes NMMI, it may \"refer\" the student to that agency. N.M.Code R. &#167; 6.31.2.11(J)(1)(c). Even in that context, the agency is not required to immediately accept the student.

We understand the district court's frustration with plaintiffs, and recognize that their complaint and subsequent briefing did not provide the clearest articulation of the unique differences between the IDEA, the RA, and the ADA claims they assert. Arguably this failure below stemmed from plaintiffs' understanding that the district court precluded them from presenting their arguments regarding the RA and the ADA in its scheduling order requesting briefing on the IDEA claims, a position the Ellenbergs argued in their opening submission to the district court</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, plaintiffs pled allegations sufficient to establish the separate and distinct nature of the RA and ADA claims. For example, in paragraph 12 of the complaint, they allege that NMMI \"had a written policy of excluding students with disabilities from admission to NMMI.\" In paragraph 13, they contend that this policy was discriminatory. In paragraph 36, they note that NMMI engaged in discrimination by refusing to admit S.E. During a hearing before the district court, NMMI's counsel recognized that plaintiffs were raising separate discrimination claims under &#167; 504 and the ADA. In that same hearing, plaintiffs' counsel stated that the \"Section 504 and ADA claims would stand alone\" from the IDEA claim, but that such claims do not stand alone for purposes of state administrative procedures because \"if there are no IDEA claims, a family does not have the power to file a Section 504 administrative grievance\" with NMPED.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Both NMMI and the district court cited this court's decision in<i>Urban ex rel. Urban</i> for the proposition that if the state provides a student with a FAPE in the least restrictive environment, it has not violated &#167; 504 or the ADA. In <i>Urban ex rel. Urban,</i> plaintiff argued that he was entitled under the ADA to reject the educational placement offered by the school district and attend his neighborhood school. This court noted that the administrative regulations promulgated by the Department of Education pursuant to &#167; 504 \"generally conform to the standards established by the IDEA.\" 89 F.3d at 728. Both regulations \"use substantially the same language regarding a school district's obligation to evaluate each disabled child, create an IEP with parental input, and provide each disabled child with an appropriate education.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, we concluded that \"if a disabled child is not entitled to a neighborhood placement under the IDEA, he is not entitled to such a placement under section 504.\" <i>Id.</i> However, we specifically noted that \"a federally-funded education system may violate &#167; 504 when the school system's practices `<i>preclude</i> the handicapped from obtaining system benefits realized by the nonhandicapped.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>N.M.

Urban</i> would also contradict Congress' express legislative mandate that the IDEA should not be \"construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(<i>l</i>). At least one scholar has provided a clear articulation of the interplay between claims under the IDEA and those brought pursuant to &#167; 504:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the IDEA, Section 504 emphasizes equal treatment, not just access to a FAPE. In other words, the drafters of Section 504 were not only concerned with [a student] receiving a FAPE somewhere (as was the case with the IDEA), but also that a federally funded program does not treat [the student] differently because [she is disabled]. Under Section 504, a state special school cannot hide behind the justification that another public school might provide a</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">FAPE; it must show that somehow [the student] does not qualify for admission. Unlike the IDEA, Section 504 does not only look at what is a FAPE, but also what is fair.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Christopher J.
