No. SS120938B)\n\n         v.\n\nRAFAELA GARCIA,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         Defendant Rafaela Garcia brought this appeal to challenge an order denying her\npetition for resentencing under Penal Code section 1170.18 (section 1170.18). She\ncontends that the court failed to appreciate that she was eligible to have her conviction of\npossession of methamphetamine reduced to a misdemeanor, pursuant to Proposition 47.\nThe People concede the error, and we agree that the court erred in refusing to consider\ndefendant’s petition.\n                                                     Background\n         Defendant was charged by complaint with felony possession of methamphetamine\non May 17, 2012, a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a).\nOn June 21, 2013, she appeared for sentencing.1 The court suspended imposition of\nsentence and placed defendant on felony probation for three years, conditioned on service\nof 60 days in jail and other terms.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             The circumstances of defendant’s conviction are not in the record on appeal.\n\f       On March 9, 2015, defendant filed a petition for resentencing under section\n1170.18, subdivision (a), asserting her eligibility for reduction of her conviction to a\nmisdemeanor. The district attorney opposed the petition, asserting defendant’s\nineligibility for treatment under the statute because she “has not been sentenced.” After\nhearing argument on the matter, the trial court decided to “stay with the traditional legal\ndefinition of ‘sentenced’ ” and denied the petition. This timely appealed followed.\n                                         Discussion\n       Section 1170.18 is derived from Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and\nSchools Act, passed by voter initiative at the November 4, 2014 election. Subdivision (a)\nof the statute provides: “A person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether\nby trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor\nunder the act that added this section (“this act”) had this act been in effect at the time of\nthe offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the\njudgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with\nSections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the Health and Safety Code . . . as those sections\nhave been amended or added by this act.” If the petitioner meets the criteria in\nsubdivision (a) of the statute, the felony sentence “shall be recalled and the petitioner\nresentenced to a misdemeanor” pursuant to the statutes under which he or she was\nconvicted, as those sections were amended or added by the Act, “unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b)); cf. T.W. v. Superior Court (2015) 236\nCal.App.4th 646, 650; People v. Rivera (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1092-1093.)\n       The parties agree that in passing Proposition 47 the voters intended to embrace\nprobationers within the reach of the resentencing provisions of section 1170.18. To\ninterpret the statutory language otherwise would, in their view, lead to absurd\nconsequences. We find merit in this position. As the People acknowledge, there is\nnothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the\n\n                                               2\n\fphrase “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” to those serving a term of\nimprisonment. Defendant points out that granting probation is in some contexts a\n“sentencing choice” (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.405(6) [“ ‘Sentence choice’\nmeans the selection of any disposition of the case that does not amount to a dismissal,\nacquittal, or grant of a new trial”]). (Cf. People v. Howard (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1084\n[referring to court’s authority “at time of sentencing” either to suspend imposition of\nsentence or impose sentence and suspend its execution]; In re DeLong (2001) 93\nCal.App.4th 562, 571 [“an order granting probation and suspending imposition of\nsentence is a form of sentencing”].) Both parties observe that the language of another\nvoter initiative, Proposition 36, the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000,\nused the language “sentenced to probation.” (See People v. Mendoza (2003) 106\nCal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [quoting ballot pamphlet to distinguish conviction from sentence\nand referring to “sentence of probation”].)\n       The ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise indicate that the voters regarded\nprobation as one of the options within a sentencing procedure;2 the legislative analysis\nrefers to offenders who are “sentenced” to supervision by a county probation officer\nwhile indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders and the caseloads of probation\nofficers would be reduced by including felony probation as a disposition eligible for\nresentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303,\n310 [discussing Proposition 47 mechanism for resentencing after being “sentenced or\n\n\n       2\n          “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . “we turn first to the language of the\nstatute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] The statutory language\nmust also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory\nscheme [in light of the electorate’s intent]. . . . When the language is ambiguous, “we\nrefer to other indicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments\ncontained in the official ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Robert L. v.\nSuperior Court (2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 900-901, quoting Horwich v. Superior Court\n(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276 and People v. Birkett (1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231.)\n\n                                              3\n\fplaced on probation”].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these options under the\nheading of “Misdemeanor Sentencing” and generally noted the fiscal consequences of\n“the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies that are changed\nto misdemeanors.” (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative, the legislative\nanalysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to distinguish between a\nprison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of probation after suspending\nimposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but suspending its execution.3\nThe statute itself allows the recall of a “felony sentence” and allows the petitioner to\nrequest “resentencing” in Health and Safety Code section 11377 cases, without\nsegregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation terms.\n(§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) And as defendant points out, Proposition 47 was intended to\nreach those with “nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,” which would\nencompass many who were granted probation. (Proposition 47, § 3.) To deprive those\ndefendants of the benefit of the reduced penalty for their offenses would create an\nincongruity the voters would not have either anticipated or approved.\n       We accordingly adopt the parties’ proffered liberal construction of the statute to\napply to all those with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who\notherwise meet the conditions specified in the statutory scheme. Because she met the\ncriteria for eligibility under section 1170.18, defendant was entitled to consideration of\nher petition for resentencing.\n                                        Disposition\n       The order is reversed, and the matter is remanded for consideration of defendant’s\npetition under section 1170.18.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Neither party suggests any significance in the latter distinction for purposes of\nProposition 47 treatment.\n\n                                              4\n\f                                  _________________________________\n                                  ELIA, ACTING P.J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nBAMATTRE-MANOUKIAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nMIHARA, J.\n\n\n\n\nThe People v.

To deprive those\ndefendants of the benefit of the reduced penalty for their offenses would create an\nincongruity the voters would not have either anticipated or approved.\n       We accordingly adopt the parties’ proffered liberal construction of the statute to\napply to all those with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who\notherwise meet the conditions specified in the statutory scheme. Because she met the\ncriteria for eligibility under section 1170.18, defendant was entitled to consideration of\nher petition for resentencing.\n                                        Disposition\n       The order is reversed, and the matter is remanded for consideration of defendant’s\npetition under section 1170.18.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Neither party suggests any significance in the latter distinction for purposes of\nProposition 47 treatment.\n\n                                              4\n\f                                  _________________________________\n                                  ELIA, ACTING P.J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nBAMATTRE-MANOUKIAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nMIHARA, J.\n\n\n\n\nThe People v.
