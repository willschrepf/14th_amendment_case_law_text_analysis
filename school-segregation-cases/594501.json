Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lipez, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jeremiah A.

Mulero-Clas, and with whom Carlos\nEnrique Cardona-Fernández was on brief, for appellees Office of the\nElectoral Comptroller and Manuel Torres-Nieves.\n\fOctober 19, 2012\n\f          Per   Curiam.    In   this   appeal   from   the   denial    of   a\n\npreliminary injunction, plaintiff labor unions claim that Sections\n\n6.007-.010 of Law 222, Puerto Rico's campaign finance law, place an\n\nunconstitutional burden on the unions' First Amendment right to\n\nengage in political speech.       Despite the gravity of plaintiffs'\n\nclaims and months of procedural wrangling, including two writs of\n\nmandamus from this court to the district court directing it to rule\n\non plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and the\n\nmerits of their constitutional claims, both the district court and\n\nthe government declined to address the merits of their claims.\n\nIndeed, we asked the Puerto Rico government three times at oral\n\nargument to defend the merits of the campaign finance provisions at\n\nissue, and each time the government declined to do so.                In the\n\nabsence of any such defense, and in light of the other factors\n\nrelevant to the preliminary injunction analysis, we issued an\n\nappellate injunction on October 11, 2012, enjoining enforcement of\n\nthe challenged provisions of Law 222 pending the final disposition\n\nof this appeal.    We now resolve that appeal.          In so doing, we\n\nexplain more fully the reasons why we ordered the entry of the\n\nappellate injunction.     We also set forth at the end of the opinion\n\nthe preliminary injunction that we now direct the district court to\n\nenter.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                             I. Background\n\n          Prior to 2011, the rights of labor unions in Puerto Rico\n\nto make political expenditures or engage in electioneering were\n\nstrictly limited by Section 4.7(c)(4) of the Puerto Rico Public\n\nService Labor Relations Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1451i(c)(4),\n\nalso known as Law 45.     Seeking to bring Puerto Rico's campaign\n\nfinance law into compliance with the Supreme Court's landmark\n\nopinion in Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 130 S. Ct.\n\n876 (2010), Puerto Rico enacted the \"Puerto Rico Political Campaign\n\nFinancing Oversight Act,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 16, also known as Law\n\n222, on November 18, 2011.\n\n          Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of Sections\n\n6.007-.010 of Law 222.   These sections outline the procedures that\n\njuridical persons such as corporations and unions must follow if\n\nthey wish to make either campaign contributions or independent\n\nexpenditures.1   Failure to comply with these procedures can result\n\nin significant financial penalties, including criminal penalties,\n\n\n     1\n        Under Law 222, juridical persons can make financial\ncontributions in support of a candidate for political office either\nthrough direct contributions or independent expenditures. Direct\ncontributions are those made directly to a political candidate or\nto a party or committee that coordinates with that candidate's\ncampaign. Independent expenditures are financial investments in\nelectioneering activity outside of a candidate's official campaign.\nPuerto Rico's campaign finance regulations define \"independent\nexpenditure or uncoordinated expenditure\" as \"an expenditure that\nis not or was not made in concert with or at the request or\nsuggestion of a political party, aspirant, candidate, or campaign\ncommittee, authorized agent, representative, or committee of any of\nthe above.\" Regulation No. 16, § 3.1.\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffor the juridical person and its officers.          Because we deem this to\n\nbe a facial challenge to an intricate statutory framework, we have\n\nincluded the full text of each of the challenged sections in an\n\nAppendix attached to this opinion.2\n\n           The plaintiffs in this case are three labor unions and\n\none non-profit organization associated with the unions.              Plaintiff\n\nunions Sindicato Puertorriqueño de Trabajadores (\"SPT\") and Unión\n\nGeneral de Trabajadores (\"UGT\") together have more than 26,000\n\nmembers in Puerto Rico.        Both SPT and UGT are affiliates of the\n\nService Employees International Union (\"SEIU\"), an international\n\nlabor organization with over 2.1 million members. Allianza SEIU is\n\na non-profit organization that provides educational and political\n\nsupport to organizations in Puerto Rico affiliated with SEIU.\n\n           Officers    from    both    UGT   and   SPT   testified    at   the\n\npreliminary injunction hearing that immediately after Law 222 was\n\npassed   the   two   unions   swiftly   initiated    plans   to   engage   in\n\npolitical speech.     On November 19, 2011 –- the day after Law 222\n\nwas signed into law -- the unions jointly adopted a platform\n\n\n\n     2\n       We note that the text of Law 222 has been amended in part by\nLaw 135, which came into effect on July 3, 2012, two days after the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint in this case. An official\ntranslation of Law 135 is not yet available. Though an unofficial\ntranslation is necessarily somewhat imprecise, we have reviewed\nplaintiffs' certified translation of Law 135, and conclude that Law\n135 makes no substantive changes to the provisions of Law 222 at\nissue here. Thus, while we rely on the official translation of Law\n222 in our opinion, our holding should be construed to apply with\nequal force to Law 222 as amended by Law 135.\n\n                                      -5-\n\ftitled \"Proposals for a Better Country\" (\"the Proposals\"), which\n\nthe unions' membership determined \"should be implemented as a\n\nsolution to the crisis that Puerto Rico is experiencing.\"                                The\n\ndistrict court described the Proposals as \"proposals to improve\n\nthe lives of their members and their families as well as the\n\nwelfare of Puerto Rico through the topics of education, health and\n\nwelfare, labor rights, sustainable development, democracy and\n\ncitizen participation, and human rights.\"3\n\n            After adopting the Proposals, the unions submitted them\n\nto    different    members        of   the    legislature         and   candidates       for\n\npolitical office to see if they would be willing to support the\n\nProposals.        On    March     30,   2012,       UGT's       Council   of    Delegates\n\ndetermined that if permitted by law, UGT would make expenditures\n\non behalf of candidates in the November 6, 2012 general election\n\nwho    supported       the   Proposals.            On    June    15,    2012,    the     SPT\n\nConsultative Board adopted a similar resolution stating that if\n\npermitted    by    law,      it   would      make       expenditures      on    behalf    of\n\nsupportive candidates in the general election.\n\n            Officers from both unions testified that they had been\n\ncautioned by their attorneys that they would face serious risks of\n\nliability under Law 222 if they made any political expenditures\n\nrelated to the upcoming general election.                        Consequently, at the\n\n\n\n       3\n      We have not been provided with an English translation of the\nProposals.\n\n                                             -6-\n\ftime the complaint in this case was filed, the unions had not yet\n\nengaged in any activities covered by Law 222, such as making\n\npolitical     contributions    or   establishing       a    political   action\n\ncommittee (\"PAC\").       However, according to testimony of SPT's\n\npresident Roberto Pagán Rodríguez, SPT had already spent between\n\n$15,000 and $20,000 by late September 2012 promoting the Proposals\n\nthemselves.     Most of this money was spent holding meetings across\n\nPuerto   Rico   for   union   members   to   discuss       the   Proposals   and\n\nprinting information about the Proposals for the unions to use\n\ninternally and at these meetings.\n\n            On July 3, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the\n\nfederal district court in Puerto Rico alleging that Sections\n\n6.007, 6.009 and 6.010 of Law 222 restricted core political speech\n\nin violation of the First Amendment.          On July 17, the plaintiffs\n\nmoved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin enforcement\n\nof Section 4(c)(7) of Law 45 and of Sections 6.007 through 6.010\n\nof Law 222 \"insofar as those provisions violate the constitutional\n\nrights of the Unions to make contributions and expenditures in\n\nconnection with elections to public office and referenda.\"4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       The plaintiffs have not always been precise in identifying\nthe scope of the relief they seek. As discussed in more detail\ninfra, the substance of the plaintiffs' argument on the merits\nconcerns primarily Section 6.010 of Law 222, and its relationship\nto other provisions of Law 222 challenged here. Indeed, plaintiffs\ndid not raise any challenges to the prior campaign finance law, Law\n45, before us.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           Even though the November 6, 2012 general election was\n\nrapidly   approaching,    the      district    court      moved   slowly   on\n\nplaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs consequently petitioned this\n\ncourt twice for extraordinary relief.              In the first instance,\n\nwithout conducting a hearing, the district court issued a sua\n\nsponte order on September 7, 2012 certifying the question of Law\n\n222's   constitutionality    to    the    Puerto   Rico    Supreme   Court.\n\nPlaintiffs petitioned this court for relief.           On September 17, we\n\nconcluded that because the district court had certified only\n\nquestions of federal constitutional law, certification to the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court was inappropriate.                 Exercising our\n\nsupervisory mandamus authority, we vacated the district court's\n\ncertification order, directed the district court to rescind the\n\ncertified questions, and ordered the district court to \"promptly\n\nrule on [plaintiffs'] motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\"\n\n           One week later, plaintiffs again petitioned this court\n\nfor a writ of mandamus.     This time, plaintiffs sought to vacate an\n\norder of the district court that, in effect, required plaintiffs\n\nto produce voluminous documents with only eighteen hours' notice.\n\nThe district court had granted the defendants' discovery motion\n\nand stated that if plaintiffs failed to comply their claim would\n\nbe dismissed with prejudice.        On September 24, 2012, we granted\n\nplaintiffs' request for mandamus relief, concluding that \"our\n\nprior order   leaves no     room    for   avoidance through       procedural\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fmaneuvering designed to defeat a decision on the merits.\"                                 We\n\nvacated the district court's discovery order in part, and again\n\nordered the district court to rule on the merits of plaintiffs'\n\nmotion.\n\n            The day after our order issued, the district court\n\nconducted an evidentiary hearing.                      On September 27, 2012, the\n\ncourt     issued        an    order   denying         plaintiffs'        request    for     a\n\npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs quickly appealed and filed a\n\nmotion for an appellate injunction pending appeal.                               We set an\n\nexpedited briefing schedule and heard oral arguments during a\n\nspecial session of this court on October 11, 2012.                            Within hours\n\nof   hearing   oral          argument,    we   issued       a    brief   order     granting\n\nplaintiffs'        motion       for      an    appellate         injunction      enjoining\n\nenforcement        of    Sections        6.007-10      of       Law   222     pending     the\n\ndisposition of this appeal.\n\n                        II. The District Court's Opinion\n\n            In its Opinion & Order denying the plaintiffs' motion\n\nfor a     preliminary         injunction,       the    district       court    framed     its\n\nanalysis using the familiar four-part test for evaluating the\n\npropriety of issuing a preliminary injunction. Relying heavily on\n\nour opinion in Respect Maine PAC v. McKee, 622 F.3d 13 (1st Cir.\n\n2010), the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had not\n\nmade a showing of irreparable harm, that the balance of equities\n\nfavored the government, and that the public interest weighed in\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\ffavor   of    denying     the    motion    for   a    preliminary    injunction.\n\nHowever, the court declined to determine whether plaintiffs had\n\nshown a likelihood of success on the merits, despite the fact that\n\nwe have repeatedly held that this factor is \"the most important\n\npart of the preliminary injunction assessment.\"                      Jean v. Mass.\n\nState Police, 492 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             Though it concluded that the balance of the equities\n\nfavored      the    government,     the     district     court   offered    little\n\nexplanation of what harm the public would suffer if plaintiffs'\n\nmotion were granted.        Without pointing to any specific provisions\n\nof Law 222, the district court concluded that \"[g]ranting the\n\nplaintiffs the emergency relief they now seek in effect leaves the\n\ngovernment     without     the    tools    to    implement     its   informational\n\ninterest and thereby maintain an informed electorate.\"                   The court\n\nthen referred to unspecified \"disruptions\" that would result if it\n\nwere to grant plaintiffs' motion.\n\n             The district court also concluded that plaintiffs had\n\nnot demonstrated irreparable harm because they \"waited until the\n\neleventh     hour    to   seek    injunctive         relief\"   and   because   \"the\n\nPlaintiffs have not presented this Court with evidence of specific\n\nplans to make expenditures to support candidates or political\n\nparties or ideologies in furtherance of [the Proposals].\"                       For\n\nreasons described in greater detail below, we conclude that the\n\nplaintiffs have not engaged in undue delay and have made a\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fsufficient showing that they will suffer an irreparable injury to\n\ntheir First Amendment rights if the enforcement of the relevant\n\nsections of Law 222 is not enjoined.\n\n                        III. Threshold Issues\n\n            Defendants argue that the complaint should be dismissed\n\nbecause of lack of standing, justiciability, and ripeness.                At\n\ntimes these threshold arguments merge into a challenge to the\n\nirreparable    injury   component     of    the   preliminary    injunction\n\nanalysis.     Generally, defendants maintain that plaintiffs \"have\n\nnot taken critical steps needed for them to be able to exercise\n\nthe First Amendment rights that they claim.\"               Defendants claim\n\nthat   plaintiffs   have   \"fail[ed]       to   create    political   action\n\ncommittees, identify and agree on candidates for political parties\n\nwho would support their [Proposals], make political contributions\n\nor expenditures in support thereof, or even make a work plan for\n\nsuch contributions or expenditures.\"\n\n            These arguments reduce to the proposition that there is\n\nnot a live controversy before the court sufficient to create\n\njurisdiction under Article III.        Even though the district court\n\ndid not address this threshold issue, \"we bear an independent\n\nobligation to assure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before\n\nproceeding to the merits.\"     Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family\n\nLand & Cattle Co., 554 U.S. 316, 324 (2008).             Although defendants\n\nattach a number of labels to their challenge, we believe that\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\ftheir argument is properly construed as an attack on the ripeness\n\nof plaintiffs' claims, and therefore analyze it as such.\n\n             \"The doctrine of ripeness has roots in both the Article\n\nIII   case     or    controversy      requirement      and     in    prudential\n\nconsiderations.\"       Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    The determination of ripeness depends on two factors:\n\n\"the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship\n\nto the parties of withholding court consideration.\"                 Abbott Labs.\n\nv. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), abrogated on other grounds\n\nby Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977); see also D.H.L.\n\nAssocs., Inc. v. O'Gorman, 199 F.3d 50, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             The inquiry as to the fitness of the issues for judicial\n\nresolution itself involves both constitutional and prudential\n\ncomponents.         \"The   constitutional     inquiry,       grounded   in    the\n\nprohibition    against     advisory    opinions,    is   one    of    timing.\"\n\nMangual, 317 F.3d at 59.       \"[I]ts basic rationale is to prevent the\n\ncourts,   through      avoidance      of   premature     adjudication,       from\n\nentangling themselves in abstract disagreements . . . .\"                 Abbott\n\nLabs., 387 U.S. at 148.            The prudential inquiry is \"whether\n\nresolution of the dispute should be postponed in the name of\n\n'judicial restraint from unnecessary decision of constitutional\n\nissues'; if elements of the case are uncertain, delay may see the\n\ndissipation of the legal dispute without need for decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fMangual, 317 F.3d at 59 (quoting Reg'l Rail Reorganization Act\n\nCases, 419 U.S. 102, 138 (1974)).\n\n            The   inquiry    into    the     hardship    to   the   parties     of\n\nwithholding court consideration is \"wholly prudential.\"                  Mangual,\n\n317 F.3d at 59.    The hardship element requires a court to consider\n\n\"whether the challenged action 'creates a direct and immediate\n\ndilemma for the parties.'\"          Verizon New Eng., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd.\n\nof Elec. Workers, Local No. 2322, 651 F.3d 176, 188 (1st Cir.\n\n2011) (quoting Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45\n\nF.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir. 1995)).        Generally, a \"mere possibility of\n\nfuture injury, unless it is the cause of some present detriment,\n\ndoes not constitute hardship.\"         Simmonds v. INS, 326 F.3d 351, 360\n\n(2d Cir. 2003).     However, the Supreme Court has made clear that\n\nwhen a plaintiff alleges \"an intention to engage in a course of\n\nconduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but\n\nproscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of\n\nprosecution thereunder, he 'should not be required to await and\n\nundergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking\n\nrelief.'\"    Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat'l Union, 442 U.S.\n\n289, 298 (1979) (quoting Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973)).\n\n            As a supplement to these universally applicable aspects\n\nof ripeness jurisprudence, we have previously said that \"when free\n\nspeech is at issue, concerns over chilling effect call for a\n\nrelaxation   of   ripeness    requirements.\"            Sullivan    v.   City   of\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fAugusta, 511 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2007); see also El Día, Inc. v.\n\nHernández Colón, 963 F.2d 488, 495-96 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"A facial\n\nchallenge    of    this     sort,   implicating      First      Amendment     values,\n\ncustomarily works a relaxation of the ripeness criteria.\").                     Such\n\na    relaxation      has     been     justified      by    the     potential     for\n\n\"irretrievable loss\" often involved in cases where First Amendment\n\nrights are at stake.          Sullivan, 511 F.3d at 31 (quoting El Día,\n\n963 F.3d at 496); see also Peachlum v. City of York, 333 F.3d 429,\n\n434-35    (3d     Cir.    2003)     (\"The   courts     have      repeatedly    shown\n\nsolicitude for First Amendment claims because of concern that,\n\neven in the absence of a fully concrete dispute, unconstitutional\n\nstatutes . . . tend to chill protected expression among those who\n\nforbear speaking because of the law's very existence.\").                      \"Thus,\n\nwhen     First    Amendment       claims    are   presented,         '[r]easonable\n\npredictability of enforcement or threats of enforcement, without\n\nmore, have sometimes been enough to ripen a claim.'\"                       Sullivan,\n\n511 F.3d at 31 (quoting New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v.\n\nGonzales, 64 F.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995)).\n\n            Despite        defendants'      attempts      to    graft   additional\n\nrequirements that we have never imposed onto the established\n\nstandards for determining ripeness in First Amendment cases,\n\nplaintiffs have done enough to show a \"reasonable predictability\n\nof   enforcement\"        sufficient    to    satisfy      the    relaxed    ripeness\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fstandard applicable to the present case.5                   A party need not\n\nmarshal all its resources and march to the line of illegality to\n\nchallenge a statute on First Amendment grounds.               Plaintiffs have\n\naverred that they intend to act in a way that would violate Law\n\n222, and they have taken steps in preparation to carry out those\n\nacts.      Furthermore,    they      have    produced   evidence     that    they\n\nsubmitted the Proposals to members of the legislature, and SPT's\n\npresident testified that UGT has already spent significant funds\n\npromoting the Proposals to its members.           In the present case, that\n\nis   all   that   is   needed   to    make    plaintiffs'    claim    ripe   for\n\nresolution.6\n\n\n      5\n       We note that this result would be the same if we were to\nconsider defendants' jurisdictional arguments under the standing\ndoctrine. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 n.10 (1975) (\"The\nstanding question thus bears close affinity to questions of\nripeness - whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to\nwarrant judicial intervention . . . .\"); McInnis-Misenor v. Me.\nMed. Ctr., 319 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"In general, standing\nand ripeness inquiries overlap. . . . The overlap is most apparent\nin cases that deny standing because an anticipated injury is too\nremote . . . .\"); Daggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics and\nElection Practices, 205 F.3d 445, 463 (1st Cir. 2000).\n      6\n       Defendants also maintain that plaintiffs have not taken\nadvantage of the procedure set out in Section 3.003(e) of Law 222,\nwhich provides that a party may request an opinion from the\nElection Comptroller as to the scope and application of the\nstatute.   However, nowhere in Section 3.003 is the Election\nComptroller given the authority to nullify unconstitutional\nprovisions of Law 222. Because it is clear that Law 222 applies to\nthe labor unions (a point that defendants conceded at oral\nargument), and because the provisions of Law 222 plaintiffs\nchallenge are so constitutionally suspect, see infra, any\nadministrative relief that the Election Comptroller could have\nprovided would have been inadequate.    Plaintiffs were therefore\nunder no obligation to exhaust such remedies.            See Coit\n\n                                      -15-\n\f              IV. The Preliminary Injunction Analysis\n\n          \"On    appeal,     we   review    the   grant   or   denial    of   a\n\npreliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.\" United States v.\n\nWeikert, 504 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2007).               \"Under that rubric,\n\nfindings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law\n\nare reviewed de novo.\"       Wine & Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode\n\nIsland, 418 F.3d 36, 46 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          In considering a plaintiff's motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction, the district court weighs four factors: \"(1) the\n\nplaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the potential\n\nfor irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) whether\n\nissuing the     injunction    will   burden    the   defendants   less   than\n\ndenying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs and (4) the\n\neffect, if any, on the public interest.\" Jean, 492 F.3d at 26-27.\n\nThough each factor is important, we keep in mind that \"[t]he sine\n\nqua non of this four-part inquiry is likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits: if the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely\n\nto succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become matters of\n\nidle curiosity.\"     New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom,\n\nInc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).          To demonstrate likelihood of\n\n\n\nIndependence Joint Venture v. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp, 489 U.S.\n561, 587 (1989) (\"Administrative remedies that are inadequate need\nnot be exhausted.\"); Sousa v. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(no exhaustion requirement \"where a resort to the agency would be\nfutile because the challenge is one that the agency has no power to\nresolve in the applicant's favor\").\n\n                                     -16-\n\fsuccess on the merits, plaintiffs must show \"more than mere\n\npossibility\" of success - rather, they must establish a \"strong\n\nlikelihood\" that they will ultimately prevail.           Respect Maine\n\nPAC, 622 F.3d at 15 (citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 21 (2008)).\n\nA. The Obligation To Address the Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Success\non the Merits\n\n           The district court declined to address the plaintiffs'\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their First Amendment\n\nclaims, stating that the remaining three factors of the standard\n\nweighed against the grant of equitable relief.      Defendants urge us\n\nto adopt a similar course of action.\n\n           This we cannot do.    In the First Amendment context, the\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits is the linchpin of the\n\npreliminary   injunction    analysis.    As   the   Supreme    Court    has\n\nexplained, \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even\n\nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable\n\ninjury.\"     Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); see also\n\nAsociación    de   Educación   Privada   de   Puerto   Rico,    Inc.     v.\n\nGarcía-Padilla, 490 F.3d 1, 21 (1st Cir. 2007) (applying Elrod to\n\nirreparable harm component of permanent injunction analysis);\n\nMaceira v. Pagan, 649 F.2d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 1981) (\"It is well\n\nestablished that the loss of first amendment freedoms constitutes\n\nirreparable    injury.\").      Accordingly,   irreparable      injury    is\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fpresumed upon a determination that the movants are likely to\n\nprevail on their First Amendment claim.\n\n           It was therefore incumbent upon the district court to\n\nengage with the merits before moving on to the remaining prongs of\n\nits analysis.    The court's stated reason for not doing so was that\n\naddressing the merits was inappropriate on an \"incomplete record,\"\n\nand that \"engag[ing] in the in-depth analysis required\" further\n\nfactual development.      To the contrary, a facial challenge to a\n\nstatute presents a question of law that the district court could\n\nand should have resolved on the present record.               See New Eng.\n\nReg'l Council of Carpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (stating that facial challenge to regulation presents \"pure\n\nquestion   of   law\");   see   also    Ctr.   for   Individual    Freedom   v.\n\nCarmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 662 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating that \"facial\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of a statute presents a pure\n\nquestion of law\").\n\nB.   Likelihood of Success\n\n           1. Standard of Review\n\n           Despite its refusal to consider the merits, the district\n\ncourt stated that the plaintiffs' challenge to Law 222 should be\n\nanalyzed, in whole or in part, under the \"exacting\" scrutiny\n\nstandard applicable to disclaimer and disclosure requirements.\n\nSee Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914; see also Daggett, 205 F.3d\n\nat   454   (applying     exacting      scrutiny     to   limits   on   direct\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fcontributions).7         Plaintiffs disagree, contending that strict\n\nscrutiny governs their claims.\n\n               Laws that burden political speech ordinarily are subject\n\nto strict scrutiny, requiring the government to prove that any\n\nrestriction \"'furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve that interest.'\"           Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 898 (quoting Fed. Elect. Comm'n v. Wisc. Right To Life, Inc.,\n\n551 U.S. 449, 464 (2007)).              The Supreme Court applied          that\n\nstandard to the regulation at issue in Citizens United, which\n\nrestricted      the    ability   of   corporations     and   unions   to   make\n\nindependent expenditures in connection with political campaigns.\n\nAfter      rejecting   any   distinction     between   natural   persons    and\n\ncorporate persons under the First Amendment, id. at 904, the Court\n\nnoted that \"[t]he purpose and effect of th[e challenged] law is to\n\nprevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations,\n\nfrom presenting both facts and opinions to the public.\"                Id. at\n\n907.       The Court observed:\n\n               When Government seeks to use its full power,\n               including the criminal law, to command where\n               a person may get his or her information or\n               what distrusted source he or she may not hear,\n\n\n       7\n       Although the basis for the district court's conclusion is\nnot clear, it appeared to believe that the unions' challenge\nencompassed an attack on Law 222's disclaimer and disclosure\nrequirements. In fact, plaintiffs asserted no challenge to Law\n222's disclosure-related requirements before the district court,\nand reiterate this position on appeal.    Those requirements are\ntherefore irrelevant, and the district court erred in relying on\nthem in its discussion of the appropriate standard of review.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            it uses censorship to control thought. This\n            is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the\n            freedom to think for ourselves.\n\nId. at 908.       The law therefore struck at the heart of core First\n\nAmendment protections and could not withstand strict scrutiny.\n\n            The    Court   explained,   however,    that    not    all   laws\n\npurporting    to    regulate   election-related    spending      are   treated\n\nsimilarly.    In certain circumstances, regulations designed \"to\n\nensure against the reality or appearance of corruption,\" such as\n\nthose capping direct contributions to political candidates or\n\nthose imposing disclosure requirements on donors, are subject to\n\nthe more lenient \"exacting scrutiny\" review.         Id. at 908; see also\n\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 26-29 (1976).8              While disclosure\n\nrequirements,      for   example,   similarly   \"burden    the    ability   to\n\nspeak,\" Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914, they \"impose no\n\nceiling on campaign related activities and do not prevent anyone\n\nfrom speaking.\" Id. (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Caps on direct contributions, for their part, are\n\njustified by their \"limited effect upon First Amendment freedoms,\"\n\nas compared to the \"weighty interest\" in avoiding corruption or\n\nthe appearance of corruption.        Buckley, 424 U.S. at 29.\n\n\n\n     8\n       Under exacting scrutiny, the government would bear the\nburden of demonstrating that \"(1) the statute as a whole . . .\nserve[s] a compelling governmental interest, and (2) a substantial\nnexus . . . exist[s] between the served interest and the\ninformation to be revealed.\" Daggett, 205 F.3d at 464 (citation\nomitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           Law 222's challenged provisions plainly are more like\n\nthe regulation given strict scrutiny by the Supreme Court in\n\nCitizens   United   than    the    contribution       limits    and    disclosure\n\nrequirements afforded less stringent review.                   Law 222 imposes\n\nsubstantial burdens on the very process through which a juridical\n\nperson determines whether and how to exercise its free speech\n\nrights.    On its face, Law 222 forbids juridical persons from\n\nspending   any   money     on   political       campaigns,     be   they     direct\n\ncontributions, independent expenditures, or otherwise, without the\n\nprocess the statute prescribes.               These provisions are backed by\n\ncriminal sanctions, administrative penalties of up to $30,000 per\n\nday, and other mechanisms designed to ensure strict compliance.\n\nIndeed, a violation of section 6.010 can subject a juridical\n\nperson's   \"highest      ranking        official\"     to   personal     financial\n\nliability for any violations, even if that individual lacked\n\nknowledge of the violation in question.\n\n           To avoid these unusually harsh sanctions, juridical\n\npersons \"have to comply with these regulations just to speak.\"\n\nCitizens United,      130 S.      Ct.    at    897.    To adopt       the   Court's\n\nlanguage, by forbidding juridical persons from exercising their\n\nspeech rights without first complying with onerous governance\n\nprocedures, the provisions \"'necessarily reduce[] the quantity of\n\nexpression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fdepth    of   their    exploration,      and    the    size        of    the   audience\n\nreached.'\"      Id. at 898 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 19).\n\n              Law   222     reaches    deep     into    the    mechanics        of   an\n\norganization's        own      self-governance         and     imposes         numerous\n\nrequirements on the organization's internal processes.                         In doing\n\nso, it seeks to dictate the terms and circumstances under which\n\nthey    are   permitted        to   express    political      opinions.          Stated\n\ndifferently, Law 222's challenged provisions are designed to\n\nregulate the if and how of a juridical person's political speech.\n\nIt is difficult to conceive of a statute that strikes more deeply\n\nat a juridical person's core First Amendment rights. Accordingly,\n\nstrict scrutiny applies.\n\n              2. Application of Strict Scrutiny to Law 222\n\n              \"Under strict scrutiny, [defendants] must prove that\n\n[the statute] . . . furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve that interest.\"             Wisc. Right To Life, 551 U.S.\n\nat 464.    \"Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at\n\nspeech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process\n\nof governing, . . . the burden is on the government, [rather than\n\nthe     plaintiffs],      to    show   the    existence       of    [a     compelling]\n\ninterest.\"     Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 786 (internal citation omitted)\n\n(quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Due to defendants' failure to present any defense to the\n\nunions' claims, the only conceivable interest we can identify is\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fdescribed in the following paragraph of Law 222's Statement of\n\nMotives:9\n\n               [C]ertain criteria and requirements shall be\n               established to ensure that the members of\n               those entities are duly informed of any\n               political statements that could be issued by\n               such entities on their behalf and at their\n               expense. By setting forth clear and effective\n               guidelines on this matter, the members of\n               juridical entities are provided with the\n               necessary information for them to give their\n               informed consent. The State, by means of this\n               Act, seeks to implement openness and clarity\n               as the public policy that shall govern\n               election processes.\n\nThus,    Law       222   purports   to   foster     democratic     decisionmaking\n\nprocesses      within      juridical     persons    and   to    ensure        that   any\n\npolitical speech that they make is given with their members' full\n\nand informed consent.\n\n               As admirable as this policy goal may be, Citizens United\n\naddressed      a    similar   interest      and   concluded     that     it    was   not\n\nsufficiently compelling.            There, the government asserted that\n\nindependent        expenditures     could    be    limited     because    dissenting\n\n\n     9\n       The district court discussed a part of the Statement of\nMotives that addressed the need to \"better identify and prevent\ncorrupt and unlawful actions\" and emphasized the value of\n\"transparency on [sic] the voting system of Puerto Rico,\" so that\nthe \"People know who provides funding for campaign activities and\nadvertisements intended to sway their opinion.\" This part of the\nStatement appears to address the statute's disclosure requirements,\nwhich are not at issue here. Defendants do not assert that Law\n222's authorization requirements are justified by an interest in\ntransparency to the public at large, nor is a connection between\nthe challenged provisions and such an interest evident.\nConsequently, we do not rely on this part of the Statement in\nidentifying the government interest at stake.\n\n                                         -23-\n\fshareholders needed protection \"from being compelled to fund\n\ncorporate political speech.\"                  130 S. Ct. at 911.            The Court was\n\nunconvinced, noting that there was \"little evidence of abuse that\n\ncannot be corrected by shareholders 'through the procedures of\n\ncorporate democracy.'\"              Id. (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 794).\n\nSimilarly,    there      has     been     no    invocation     here      of   legislative\n\nfindings that juridical persons are engaging in abuse of their\n\ninternal procedures in order to suppress the speech of their\n\ndissenting members, or that their internal governance mechanisms\n\nare insufficient to address such concerns.                        We therefore cannot\n\naccept     this    rationale         as   a    justification       for      the   statute.\n\n             Even   if     Law      222's      provisions     were     justified       by   a\n\ncompelling    interest         in    fostering        juridical    persons'       internal\n\ndemocratic procedures, the statute is far from narrowly tailored\n\nto meet that end.          The most problematic aspect of the statute is\n\nsection    6.010,     which         describes        the   detailed    scheme      that     a\n\njuridical person must comply with in making any election-related\n\nexpenditures. Among other requirements, the juridical person must\n\nhold a membership meeting, where the members must vote to approve\n\nany   \"use    of     the     money        or    property      of      the     entity    for\n\nelection-related purposes.\"10                 The members \"shall be informed of\n\n\n      10\n        Section 2.004(42) of Law 222 defines \"Membership\" or\n\"Members\" as \"persons entitled to vote in a juridical person such\nas shareholders, partners, members subject to membership fees and\nwho are entitled to vote in the entity in question.\" Although the\nstatute repeatedly refers to \"members,\" it is clear that      its\n\n                                              -24-\n\fthe purposes of the electioneering communication or communications\n\nthat shall be paid for, including the specific purpose of the\n\nmessages to be transmitted and the amount of money that shall be\n\nearmarked to such campaign,\" and the members must \"be clearly\n\ninformed of whether they, as an organization, intend to support,\n\noppose, or advocate for the election or defeat of a political\n\nparty, ideology, aspirant, or candidate.\"               What is more, \"a\n\nmajority plus one\" of the juridical person's members not only must\n\nattend   this    membership   meeting,     but   also   must   approve   the\n\nelection-related expenditure before funds can be disbursed.\n\n           If these restrictions were not burdensome enough, Puerto\n\nRico's   election     comptroller   has    issued    regulations    further\n\ndefining the statute's terms.         See Government of Puerto Rico,\n\nOffice   of     the   Electoral   Comptroller,      Regulations    No.   16,\n\nRegulations to Incur Independent Expenditures and to Establish a\n\nSegregated Funds Committee (2012) [hereinafter \"Regulations\"].\n\nThese regulations require the \"membership meeting\" to be \"an\n\nassembly to be held simultaneously in various jurisdictions or\n\ngeographic areas provided they are held on the same day up to\n\n12:00 midnight,\" Regulations, § 7.4 (emphasis added), meaning that\n\n\n\nrestrictions apply to individuals who hold some form of ownership\ninterest or voting stake in entities such as corporations and\npartnerships.    See also id. § 2.004(56) (defining \"juridical\nperson\" as \"includ[ing] corporations, limited liability companies,\npartnerships, cooperatives, trusts, groups of persons organized as\nan association, and labor organizations\").\n\n                                    -25-\n\f\"a majority plus one\" of the entity's members must meet on the\n\nsame day (although not necessarily in the same location).                 The\n\nonly issue that can be discussed at this congregation is the\n\nexpenditure for election-related purposes.               Additionally, the\n\nregulations require that the \"maximum amount\" to be expended must\n\nbe stated in the notice calling for the meeting, as well as\n\ndisclosed to the members at the meeting.              Regulations, § 7.3.\n\nMoreover, noncompliance subjects a juridical person to an array of\n\nsanctions, including daily fines, penalties against the person's\n\nhighest ranking official, and makes \"payment in violation of the\n\nprovisions of [the statute]\" a felony punishable by criminal\n\nfines.\n\n             Law 222 therefore piles burden upon burden in its effort\n\nto restrict the political speech of juridical persons, without any\n\nindication that these measures are remotely necessary to meet the\n\narticulated government interest.             Leaving aside the draconian\n\nnature of the civil and criminal penalties at issue, the rationale\n\nfor many of its requirements is difficult to fathom.               Why is it\n\nnecessary to require a single collective membership meeting to\n\ndiscuss campaign expenditures, or to demand that a majority of the\n\nmembership be present to approve election-related expenditures?\n\nWhy   must   all   members   meet   on   a   single   day?   Why   must   the\n\nmembership discuss only the election-related expenditure at this\n\nmeeting and decline to address any other subjects?            Even if some\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fmeasure of restriction on juridical persons' internal procedures\n\nwere justified, why these specific procedures, and toward what\n\nend?    Given their refusal to defend the merits of such provisions,\n\ndefendants leave all of these crucial questions unanswered.                       In\n\nthe    absence          of   a   discernible   rationale    for   the   challenged\n\nprovisions, we cannot presently conclude that the challenged\n\nprovisions are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\n\ninterest.\n\n                  In sum, Law 222's challenged provisions are not likely\n\nto withstand strict scrutiny.               For the reasons stated, the unions\n\nhave demonstrated a strong likelihood that they will succeed on\n\ntheir First Amendment challenge to Law 222.11\n\n                  3.     Potential for Irreparable Injury\n\n                  There is no need for an extensive analysis of this\n\nelement          of    the   preliminary   injunction   inquiry.        Because   we\n\nconclude that plaintiffs have made a strong showing of likelihood\n\nof success on the merits of their First Amendment claim, it\n\nfollows that the irreparable injury component of the preliminary\n\ninjunction analysis is satisfied as well.                  See Elrod, 427 U.S. at\n\n373; Maceira, 649 F.2d at 18 (\"It is well established that the\n\nloss        of    first      amendment     freedoms   constitutes       irreparable\n\ninjury.\"); see also Phelps-Roper v. Nixon, 545 F.3d 685, 690 (8th\n\n\n       11\n       Because we conclude that the unions' First Amendment claims\nare likely to succeed on their merits, we do not address their\ncontention that the statute as drafted is void for vagueness.\n\n                                           -27-\n\fCir. 2008) (\"If [plaintiff] can establish a sufficient likelihood\n\nof success on the merits of her First Amendment claim, she will\n\nalso   have    established      irreparable     harm    as   a    result   of   the\n\ndeprivation.\"). The district court therefore erred in its finding\n\nthat plaintiffs failed to make a sufficient showing of irreparable\n\ninjury. See Child Evangelism Fellowship of Minn. v. Minneapolis\n\nSpecial Sch. Dist. No. 1, 690 F.3d 996, 1004 (8th Cir. 2012)\n\n(holding that district court's error in finding that plaintiff did\n\nnot establish high likelihood of success on the merits of its\n\nFirst Amendment claim meant that it necessarily erred in its\n\nfinding that plaintiff did not establish irreparable harm).\n\n              4.    Balance of Harms and Public Interest\n\n              The    district   court    blended     the     third   and   fourth\n\ncomponents of the preliminary injunction analysis and determined\n\nthat the balance of the equities and the public interest justified\n\ndenial   of    the     injunction.       The    court   determined     that     the\n\ngovernment     would    be   stripped    of    its   tools   to   implement     its\n\ninformational interest and the public would be left uninformed.\n\nAs noted, this finding is based on a misapprehension by the\n\ndistrict court of the scope of plaintiffs' challenge to Law 222,\n\nsince plaintiffs have explicitly disavowed any challenge to the\n\nlaw's accounting, disclosure, and reporting requirements.\n\n              Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted in Citizens United\n\nthat the suppression of political speech harms not only the\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fspeaker, but also the public to whom the speech would be directed:\n\n\"The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use\n\ninformation to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened\n\nself-government and a necessary means to protect it.\"                  130 S. Ct.\n\nat   898.      To   deprive   plaintiffs of the         right      to speak     will\n\ntherefore have the concomitant effect of depriving \"the public of\n\nthe right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and\n\nspeakers      are   worthy    of   consideration.\"      Id.     at   899.       This\n\ndeprivation     would   be    especially      significant     in     the   election\n\ncontext.      Id. (\"[I]t is inherent in the nature of the political\n\nprocess that voters must be free to obtain information from\n\ndiverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes.\").\n\nThe district court failed to consider the interest of the public\n\nin having a robust debate on the issues of concern to plaintiffs.\n\n              In further explanation of its denial of the preliminary\n\ninjunction, the district court relied heavily on our decision in\n\nRespect Maine PAC in support of its two central findings: (1) that\n\ngranting plaintiffs' requested relief would cause substantial\n\ndisruption, and (2) that plaintiffs' alleged delay in bringing the\n\naction      justified   the   denial    of    relief.     This       reliance    was\n\nmisplaced.      Respect Maine PAC concerned a public matching-funds\n\nscheme for candidates for state office.                  Under that scheme,\n\ncandidates had to declare early in their campaigns whether to\n\naccept public matching funds.            If a candidate opted in to the\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fpublic funds scheme, she had to agree to abide by certain rules,\n\nincluding a $750 cap on individual contributions.           See Cushing v.\n\nMcKee, 738 F. Supp. 2d 146, 148-49 (D. Me. 2010) (describing\n\nprovisions of Maine public matching-funds scheme).               By the time\n\nthe   plaintiffs   in   Respect   Maine    PAC   filed   their    complaint,\n\ncandidates for state office had been on the campaign trail for\n\nmore than eight months, and roughly 280 candidates had opted in to\n\nthe scheme.   See Maine PAC, 622 F.3d at 16.\n\n           The instant case is easily distinguished from Respect\n\nMaine PAC on the issues of timing and delay.             The law at issue\n\nthere had been in place for more than a decade and had endured\n\nseveral election cycles.      Id.    At the time the complaint in the\n\ninstant case was filed, Law 222 was only seven-and-a-half months\n\nold, and it was a response to Citizens United, which dramatically\n\nchanged prior law on the First Amendment rights of corporations\n\nand unions.   As already noted, there is evidence in the record\n\nthat since Law 222 was passed, the unions have been consistently\n\ndeveloping their platform and campaign plans.\n\n           Moreover, the consequences of disrupting the public\n\nfinancing scheme at issue in Respect Maine PAC in the crucial\n\nweeks before the campaign would have been significant and chaotic,\n\nlargely because granting the injunction would have altered rules\n\nthat candidates and the public had rightfully relied upon for\n\nyears.   See Respect Maine PAC, 622 F.3d at 16.            In the instant\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fcase, there is simply no evidence that any such disruption would\n\noccur.    The only consequence of this injunction will be that\n\njuridical persons who were unlawfully prevented from engaging in\n\npolitical speech will now be able to engage in such speech.\n\n                               V. Conclusion\n\n            On October 11, 2012, we granted plaintiffs' motion for\n\nan appellate injunction pending the disposition of this appeal.\n\nThat order enjoined enforcement of Sections 6.007-.010 of Law 222.\n\nNow that we have resolved the plaintiffs' interlocutory appeal, we\n\nhereby   dissolve     the   appellate   injunction          and    remand   to     the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to enter the following order\n\nforthwith:\n\n\n     The defendants are hereby enjoined from enforcing the\n     following provisions of Law 222: 1) Section 6.010 in\n     full; 2) the provision of Section 6.007 that states,\n     \"[i]n order for a juridical person to be able to\n     establish a segregated committee or fund for these\n     purposes, it must comply with the limitations and\n     requirements set forth in Section 6.010 of this Chapter\";\n     and 3) the provision of Section 6.009 that states \"[t]o\n     make contributions or incur in this type of expenditures,\n     a juridical person must obtain authorization of the\n     majority vote of its members, as provided in Section\n     6.010 of this Act.\n\n            We do not enjoin the enforcement of Section 6.008, which\n\nsets limits for contributions from segregated committees and\n\npolitical    action    committees.          Those        limits    have   not    been\n\nchallenged    here.    Similarly,    nothing        in    our     order   should    be\n\nconstrued    to   undermine   any   disclosure           requirements      in   other\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fsections of Law 222. These requirements are also unchallenged\n\nhere.\n\n         Mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n         So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                             -32-\n\fStatutory Appendix\n\n\nLaw No. 222, P.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, §§ 625g–625j.\n\nSection 6.007.-Juridical Persons.-\n\nNo juridical person shall make contributions out [sic] its own\nresources in or outside Puerto Rico to any political party,\naspirant, candidate, campaign committee, or to any authorized\nagent, representative, or committee thereof, or to political\naction   committees   that  make   contributions   or   coordinate\nexpenditures among them. However, it may establish, organize, and\nadminister a committee, to be known as a segregated committee or\nfund that, for the purposes of contributions and expenditures,\nshall be treated as a public action committee that must be\nregistered in the Office of the Election Comptroller, render\nreports, and comply with all requirements imposed under this Act.\nThus, its members, employees, and their immediate family or\nrelated persons may make contributions that shall be deposited in\nthe account established and registered in the Office of the\nElection Comptroller. In order for a juridical person to be able\nto establish a segregated committee or fund for these purposes, it\nmust comply with the limitations and requirements set forth in\nSection 6.010 of this Chapter. The committee, organization, or\ncitizen group may make donations from said account to political\nparties, aspirants, candidates, and campaign committees and\nauthorized committees, as well as to political action committees\nmaking contributions to any of them.\nP.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 625g.\n\nSection 6.008.-Limits for Segregated Committees and Public Action\nCommittees.-\n\nSegregated committees or funds may make contributions to any\npolitical party, aspirant, candidate, campaign committee, and\nauthorized committees, and to any authorized agent and\nrepresentative thereof, provided that the contributions do not\nexceed the limits established in this Act for natural persons or\naggregates. These limits shall also apply to contributions made by\nmembers to a juridical person that shall use them to make a\ncontribution to a political party, aspirant, candidate, campaign\ncommittee, and authorized committee, or to any authorized agent\nand representative thereof. Two (2) or more political action\ncommittees shall be deemed to be one (1) single committee if they\nhave been established by the same person or group of persons, are\ncontrolled by the same person or group of persons, or share\nofficials, directors, or employees.\n\n                              -33-\n\fP.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 625h.\n\nSection 6.009.-Independent Expenditures.-\n\nNothing in this Act shall limit contributions of money or anything\nof value made for election-related purposes to natural persons,\njuridical persons, or political action committees that do not\ncontribute or incur coordinated expenditures with political\nparties, aspirants, candidates, campaign committees, or authorized\ncommittees, or with any authorized agent and representative\nthereof. However, in these cases, the provisions of Section 6.001\nof this Act shall apply. To make contributions or incur in this\ntype of expenditures, a juridical person must obtain the\nauthorization of the majority vote of its members, as provided in\nSection 6.010 of this Act.\nP.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 625i.\n\nSection 6.010.-Authorization to Establish a Segregated Committee\nor Fund or to Incur Expenditures of Election-related Purposes.-\n\n1. The juridical person must hold a membership meeting. The call\nfor such meeting shall be issued fifteen (15) days before the\nholding thereof and shall only include this authorization purpose.\n\n2. At the meeting, the majority plus one of the total members of\nthe entity, whether a corporation, cooperative, partnership,\nassociation, or labor organization, shall approve by direct and\nsecret vote the use of the money or property of the entity for\nelection-related purposes. Under no circumstances shall a vote\nthat has not been cast be counted as a vote in favor of the use of\nmoney or the property for election-related purposes.\n\n3. For such authorization, the members shall be informed of the\npurposes of the electioneering communication or communications\nthat shall be paid for, including the specific purpose of the\nmessages to be transmitted and the amount of money that shall be\nearmarked to such campaign. Before voting at the meeting, the\nmembers shall be clearly informed of whether they, as an\norganization, intend to support, oppose, or advocate for the\nelection or defeat or a political party, ideology, aspirant, or\ncandidate. No organizational structures shall be created to evade\nthe requirement of obtaining the informed consent of the members\nof any juridical person.\n\n4. The board of directors and the highest ranking official of the\njuridical person in question shall certify, under oath and under\npenalty of contempt, that all the requirements of this Section\nwere met. The certification shall include the notice sent to all\n\n                              -34-\n\fmembers and the date thereof, the date and the place of the\nmeeting, the total number of members of the juridical person, the\nnumber of members that attended the meeting, the exact results of\nthe voting, and an accurate and detailed description of the\ninformation regarding the amount of money or property that was\napproved. This sworn certification shall state the veracity and\naccuracy of the information furnished. In addition, the Election\nComptroller shall immediately publish said certification over the\nInternet.\n\n5. Said certification shall be remitted, on the business day\nfollowing the voting, to the Office of the Election Comptroller.\nAfter obtaining the corresponding authorization and remitting the\naforementioned certification, the entity shall register in the\nOffice of the Election Comptroller as an entity that intends to\nincur expenditures for election-related purposes or make\ncontributions,   and   render  the   appropriate   reports.   The\nregistration of such entity shall be carried out according to the\ndemands and requirements of a Political Action Committee.\n\n6. Any executive, director, manager, managing partner, and the\nhighest ranking official thereof at the time the contribution or\nexpenditure was made for election-related purposes in violation of\nthis Section shall be responsible for compensating the juridical\nperson ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or the amount of the\ncontribution or expenditure, plus any lawfully applicable\ninterest, whichever is higher. This responsibility shall be\nseparate and independent from any other fine or offense set forth\nin this or any other Act. Any member of the juridical person may\nrequest the refund established in this Section to the Court. Any\nmember of the juridical person may file a complaint, under oath,\nwith the Office of the Election Comptroller to report any\nviolations of this Section, or resort to the Court in the event\nthat his/her complaint is not addressed.\n\n7. This process may be regulated by the Office of the Election\nComptroller subject to the requirements of this Act.\nP.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 625j.\n\n\n\n\n                              -35-\n\f",

In   this   appeal   from   the   denial    of   a\n\npreliminary injunction, plaintiff labor unions claim that Sections\n\n6.007-.010 of Law 222, Puerto Rico's campaign finance law, place an\n\nunconstitutional burden on the unions' First Amendment right to\n\nengage in political speech.       Despite the gravity of plaintiffs'\n\nclaims and months of procedural wrangling, including two writs of\n\nmandamus from this court to the district court directing it to rule\n\non plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and the\n\nmerits of their constitutional claims, both the district court and\n\nthe government declined to address the merits of their claims.\n\nIndeed, we asked the Puerto Rico government three times at oral\n\nargument to defend the merits of the campaign finance provisions at\n\nissue, and each time the government declined to do so.                In the\n\nabsence of any such defense, and in light of the other factors\n\nrelevant to the preliminary injunction analysis, we issued an\n\nappellate injunction on October 11, 2012, enjoining enforcement of\n\nthe challenged provisions of Law 222 pending the final disposition\n\nof this appeal.    We now resolve that appeal.          In so doing, we\n\nexplain more fully the reasons why we ordered the entry of the\n\nappellate injunction.

Background\n\n          Prior to 2011, the rights of labor unions in Puerto Rico\n\nto make political expenditures or engage in electioneering were\n\nstrictly limited by Section 4.7(c)(4) of the Puerto Rico Public\n\nService Labor Relations Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1451i(c)(4),\n\nalso known as Law 45.     Seeking to bring Puerto Rico's campaign\n\nfinance law into compliance with the Supreme Court's landmark\n\nopinion in Citizens United v.

Laws Ann. tit. 16, also known as Law\n\n222, on November 18, 2011.\n\n          Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of Sections\n\n6.007-.010 of Law 222.   These sections outline the procedures that\n\njuridical persons such as corporations and unions must follow if\n\nthey wish to make either campaign contributions or independent\n\nexpenditures.1   Failure to comply with these procedures can result\n\nin significant financial penalties, including criminal penalties,\n\n\n     1\n        Under Law 222, juridical persons can make financial\ncontributions in support of a candidate for political office either\nthrough direct contributions or independent expenditures. Direct\ncontributions are those made directly to a political candidate or\nto a party or committee that coordinates with that candidate's\ncampaign. Independent expenditures are financial investments in\nelectioneering activity outside of a candidate's official campaign.\nPuerto Rico's campaign finance regulations define \"independent\nexpenditure or uncoordinated expenditure\" as \"an expenditure that\nis not or was not made in concert with or at the request or\nsuggestion of a political party, aspirant, candidate, or campaign\ncommittee, authorized agent, representative, or committee of any of\nthe above.\" Regulation No. 16, § 3.1.\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffor the juridical person and its officers.          Because we deem this to\n\nbe a facial challenge to an intricate statutory framework, we have\n\nincluded the full text of each of the challenged sections in an\n\nAppendix attached to this opinion.2\n\n           The plaintiffs in this case are three labor unions and\n\none non-profit organization associated with the unions.              Plaintiff\n\nunions Sindicato Puertorriqueño de Trabajadores (\"SPT\") and Unión\n\nGeneral de Trabajadores (\"UGT\") together have more than 26,000\n\nmembers in Puerto Rico.        Both SPT and UGT are affiliates of the\n\nService Employees International Union (\"SEIU\"), an international\n\nlabor organization with over 2.1 million members. Allianza SEIU is\n\na non-profit organization that provides educational and political\n\nsupport to organizations in Puerto Rico affiliated with SEIU.\n\n           Officers    from    both    UGT   and   SPT   testified    at   the\n\npreliminary injunction hearing that immediately after Law 222 was\n\npassed   the   two   unions   swiftly   initiated    plans   to   engage   in\n\npolitical speech.     On November 19, 2011 –- the day after Law 222\n\nwas signed into law -- the unions jointly adopted a platform\n\n\n\n     2\n       We note that the text of Law 222 has been amended in part by\nLaw 135, which came into effect on July 3, 2012, two days after the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint in this case. An official\ntranslation of Law 135 is not yet available. Though an unofficial\ntranslation is necessarily somewhat imprecise, we have reviewed\nplaintiffs' certified translation of Law 135, and conclude that Law\n135 makes no substantive changes to the provisions of Law 222 at\nissue here. Thus, while we rely on the official translation of Law\n222 in our opinion, our holding should be construed to apply with\nequal force to Law 222 as amended by Law 135.\n\n                                      -5-\n\ftitled \"Proposals for a Better Country\" (\"the Proposals\"), which\n\nthe unions' membership determined \"should be implemented as a\n\nsolution to the crisis that Puerto Rico is experiencing.\"                                The\n\ndistrict court described the Proposals as \"proposals to improve\n\nthe lives of their members and their families as well as the\n\nwelfare of Puerto Rico through the topics of education, health and\n\nwelfare, labor rights, sustainable development, democracy and\n\ncitizen participation, and human rights.\"3\n\n            After adopting the Proposals, the unions submitted them\n\nto    different    members        of   the    legislature         and   candidates       for\n\npolitical office to see if they would be willing to support the\n\nProposals.        On    March     30,   2012,       UGT's       Council   of    Delegates\n\ndetermined that if permitted by law, UGT would make expenditures\n\non behalf of candidates in the November 6, 2012 general election\n\nwho    supported       the   Proposals.            On    June    15,    2012,    the     SPT\n\nConsultative Board adopted a similar resolution stating that if\n\npermitted    by    law,      it   would      make       expenditures      on    behalf    of\n\nsupportive candidates in the general election.\n\n            Officers from both unions testified that they had been\n\ncautioned by their attorneys that they would face serious risks of\n\nliability under Law 222 if they made any political expenditures\n\nrelated to the upcoming general election.                        Consequently, at the\n\n\n\n       3\n      We have not been provided with an English translation of the\nProposals.\n\n                                             -6-\n\ftime the complaint in this case was filed, the unions had not yet\n\nengaged in any activities covered by Law 222, such as making\n\npolitical     contributions    or   establishing       a    political   action\n\ncommittee (\"PAC\").       However, according to testimony of SPT's\n\npresident Roberto Pagán Rodríguez, SPT had already spent between\n\n$15,000 and $20,000 by late September 2012 promoting the Proposals\n\nthemselves.     Most of this money was spent holding meetings across\n\nPuerto   Rico   for   union   members   to   discuss       the   Proposals   and\n\nprinting information about the Proposals for the unions to use\n\ninternally and at these meetings.\n\n            On July 3, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the\n\nfederal district court in Puerto Rico alleging that Sections\n\n6.007, 6.009 and 6.010 of Law 222 restricted core political speech\n\nin violation of the First Amendment.          On July 17, the plaintiffs\n\nmoved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin enforcement\n\nof Section 4(c)(7) of Law 45 and of Sections 6.007 through 6.010\n\nof Law 222 \"insofar as those provisions violate the constitutional\n\nrights of the Unions to make contributions and expenditures in\n\nconnection with elections to public office and referenda.\"4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       The plaintiffs have not always been precise in identifying\nthe scope of the relief they seek. As discussed in more detail\ninfra, the substance of the plaintiffs' argument on the merits\nconcerns primarily Section 6.010 of Law 222, and its relationship\nto other provisions of Law 222 challenged here. Indeed, plaintiffs\ndid not raise any challenges to the prior campaign finance law, Law\n45, before us.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           Even though the November 6, 2012 general election was\n\nrapidly   approaching,    the      district    court      moved   slowly   on\n\nplaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs consequently petitioned this\n\ncourt twice for extraordinary relief.              In the first instance,\n\nwithout conducting a hearing, the district court issued a sua\n\nsponte order on September 7, 2012 certifying the question of Law\n\n222's   constitutionality    to    the    Puerto   Rico    Supreme   Court.\n\nPlaintiffs petitioned this court for relief.           On September 17, we\n\nconcluded that because the district court had certified only\n\nquestions of federal constitutional law, certification to the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court was inappropriate.                 Exercising our\n\nsupervisory mandamus authority, we vacated the district court's\n\ncertification order, directed the district court to rescind the\n\ncertified questions, and ordered the district court to \"promptly\n\nrule on [plaintiffs'] motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\"\n\n           One week later, plaintiffs again petitioned this court\n\nfor a writ of mandamus.     This time, plaintiffs sought to vacate an\n\norder of the district court that, in effect, required plaintiffs\n\nto produce voluminous documents with only eighteen hours' notice.\n\nThe district court had granted the defendants' discovery motion\n\nand stated that if plaintiffs failed to comply their claim would\n\nbe dismissed with prejudice.        On September 24, 2012, we granted\n\nplaintiffs' request for mandamus relief, concluding that \"our\n\nprior order   leaves no     room    for   avoidance through       procedural\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fmaneuvering designed to defeat a decision on the merits.\"                                 We\n\nvacated the district court's discovery order in part, and again\n\nordered the district court to rule on the merits of plaintiffs'\n\nmotion.\n\n            The day after our order issued, the district court\n\nconducted an evidentiary hearing.                      On September 27, 2012, the\n\ncourt     issued        an    order   denying         plaintiffs'        request    for     a\n\npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs quickly appealed and filed a\n\nmotion for an appellate injunction pending appeal.                               We set an\n\nexpedited briefing schedule and heard oral arguments during a\n\nspecial session of this court on October 11, 2012.                            Within hours\n\nof   hearing   oral          argument,    we   issued       a    brief   order     granting\n\nplaintiffs'        motion       for      an    appellate         injunction      enjoining\n\nenforcement        of    Sections        6.007-10      of       Law   222     pending     the\n\ndisposition of this appeal.\n\n                        II. The District Court's Opinion\n\n            In its Opinion & Order denying the plaintiffs' motion\n\nfor a     preliminary         injunction,       the    district       court    framed     its\n\nanalysis using the familiar four-part test for evaluating the\n\npropriety of issuing a preliminary injunction.

Without pointing to any specific provisions\n\nof Law 222, the district court concluded that \"[g]ranting the\n\nplaintiffs the emergency relief they now seek in effect leaves the\n\ngovernment     without     the    tools    to    implement     its   informational\n\ninterest and thereby maintain an informed electorate.\"                   The court\n\nthen referred to unspecified \"disruptions\" that would result if it\n\nwere to grant plaintiffs' motion.\n\n             The district court also concluded that plaintiffs had\n\nnot demonstrated irreparable harm because they \"waited until the\n\neleventh     hour    to   seek    injunctive         relief\"   and   because   \"the\n\nPlaintiffs have not presented this Court with evidence of specific\n\nplans to make expenditures to support candidates or political\n\nparties or ideologies in furtherance of [the Proposals].\"                       For\n\nreasons described in greater detail below, we conclude that the\n\nplaintiffs have not engaged in undue delay and have made a\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fsufficient showing that they will suffer an irreparable injury to\n\ntheir First Amendment rights if the enforcement of the relevant\n\nsections of Law 222 is not enjoined.\n\n                        III. Threshold Issues\n\n            Defendants argue that the complaint should be dismissed\n\nbecause of lack of standing, justiciability, and ripeness.                At\n\ntimes these threshold arguments merge into a challenge to the\n\nirreparable    injury   component     of    the   preliminary    injunction\n\nanalysis.     Generally, defendants maintain that plaintiffs \"have\n\nnot taken critical steps needed for them to be able to exercise\n\nthe First Amendment rights that they claim.\"               Defendants claim\n\nthat   plaintiffs   have   \"fail[ed]       to   create    political   action\n\ncommittees, identify and agree on candidates for political parties\n\nwho would support their [Proposals], make political contributions\n\nor expenditures in support thereof, or even make a work plan for\n\nsuch contributions or expenditures.\"\n\n            These arguments reduce to the proposition that there is\n\nnot a live controversy before the court sufficient to create\n\njurisdiction under Article III.        Even though the district court\n\ndid not address this threshold issue, \"we bear an independent\n\nobligation to assure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before\n\nproceeding to the merits.\"     Plains Commerce Bank v.

In fact, plaintiffs asserted no challenge to Law\n222's disclosure-related requirements before the district court,\nand reiterate this position on appeal.    Those requirements are\ntherefore irrelevant, and the district court erred in relying on\nthem in its discussion of the appropriate standard of review.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            it uses censorship to control thought.

Law 222 imposes\n\nsubstantial burdens on the very process through which a juridical\n\nperson determines whether and how to exercise its free speech\n\nrights.    On its face, Law 222 forbids juridical persons from\n\nspending   any   money     on   political       campaigns,     be   they     direct\n\ncontributions, independent expenditures, or otherwise, without the\n\nprocess the statute prescribes.               These provisions are backed by\n\ncriminal sanctions, administrative penalties of up to $30,000 per\n\nday, and other mechanisms designed to ensure strict compliance.\n\nIndeed, a violation of section 6.010 can subject a juridical\n\nperson's   \"highest      ranking        official\"     to   personal     financial\n\nliability for any violations, even if that individual lacked\n\nknowledge of the violation in question.\n\n           To avoid these unusually harsh sanctions, juridical\n\npersons \"have to comply with these regulations just to speak.\"\n\nCitizens United,      130 S.

To adopt       the   Court's\n\nlanguage, by forbidding juridical persons from exercising their\n\nspeech rights without first complying with onerous governance\n\nprocedures, the provisions \"'necessarily reduce[] the quantity of\n\nexpression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fdepth    of   their    exploration,      and    the    size        of    the   audience\n\nreached.'\"      Id. at 898 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 19).\n\n              Law   222     reaches    deep     into    the    mechanics        of   an\n\norganization's        own      self-governance         and     imposes         numerous\n\nrequirements on the organization's internal processes.                         In doing\n\nso, it seeks to dictate the terms and circumstances under which\n\nthey    are   permitted        to   express    political      opinions.          Stated\n\ndifferently, Law 222's challenged provisions are designed to\n\nregulate the if and how of a juridical person's political speech.\n\nIt is difficult to conceive of a statute that strikes more deeply\n\nat a juridical person's core First Amendment rights. Accordingly,\n\nstrict scrutiny applies.\n\n              2.

By setting forth clear and effective\n               guidelines on this matter, the members of\n               juridical entities are provided with the\n               necessary information for them to give their\n               informed consent. The State, by means of this\n               Act, seeks to implement openness and clarity\n               as the public policy that shall govern\n               election processes.\n\nThus,    Law       222   purports   to   foster     democratic     decisionmaking\n\nprocesses      within      juridical     persons    and   to    ensure        that   any\n\npolitical speech that they make is given with their members' full\n\nand informed consent.\n\n               As admirable as this policy goal may be, Citizens United\n\naddressed      a    similar   interest      and   concluded     that     it    was   not\n\nsufficiently compelling.            There, the government asserted that\n\nindependent        expenditures     could    be    limited     because    dissenting\n\n\n     9\n       The district court discussed a part of the Statement of\nMotives that addressed the need to \"better identify and prevent\ncorrupt and unlawful actions\" and emphasized the value of\n\"transparency on [sic] the voting system of Puerto Rico,\" so that\nthe \"People know who provides funding for campaign activities and\nadvertisements intended to sway their opinion.\" This part of the\nStatement appears to address the statute's disclosure requirements,\nwhich are not at issue here. Defendants do not assert that Law\n222's authorization requirements are justified by an interest in\ntransparency to the public at large, nor is a connection between\nthe challenged provisions and such an interest evident.\nConsequently, we do not rely on this part of the Statement in\nidentifying the government interest at stake.\n\n                                         -23-\n\fshareholders needed protection \"from being compelled to fund\n\ncorporate political speech.\"                  130 S. Ct. at 911.            The Court was\n\nunconvinced, noting that there was \"little evidence of abuse that\n\ncannot be corrected by shareholders 'through the procedures of\n\ncorporate democracy.'\"              Id. (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 794).\n\nSimilarly,    there      has     been     no    invocation     here      of   legislative\n\nfindings that juridical persons are engaging in abuse of their\n\ninternal procedures in order to suppress the speech of their\n\ndissenting members, or that their internal governance mechanisms\n\nare insufficient to address such concerns.                        We therefore cannot\n\naccept     this    rationale         as   a    justification       for      the   statute.\n\n             Even   if     Law      222's      provisions     were     justified       by   a\n\ncompelling    interest         in    fostering        juridical    persons'       internal\n\ndemocratic procedures, the statute is far from narrowly tailored\n\nto meet that end.          The most problematic aspect of the statute is\n\nsection    6.010,     which         describes        the   detailed    scheme      that     a\n\njuridical person must comply with in making any election-related\n\nexpenditures. Among other requirements, the juridical person must\n\nhold a membership meeting, where the members must vote to approve\n\nany   \"use    of     the     money        or    property      of      the     entity    for\n\nelection-related purposes.\"10                 The members \"shall be informed of\n\n\n      10\n        Section 2.004(42) of Law 222 defines \"Membership\" or\n\"Members\" as \"persons entitled to vote in a juridical person such\nas shareholders, partners, members subject to membership fees and\nwho are entitled to vote in the entity in question.\" Although the\nstatute repeatedly refers to \"members,\" it is clear that      its\n\n                                              -24-\n\fthe purposes of the electioneering communication or communications\n\nthat shall be paid for, including the specific purpose of the\n\nmessages to be transmitted and the amount of money that shall be\n\nearmarked to such campaign,\" and the members must \"be clearly\n\ninformed of whether they, as an organization, intend to support,\n\noppose, or advocate for the election or defeat of a political\n\nparty, ideology, aspirant, or candidate.\"               What is more, \"a\n\nmajority plus one\" of the juridical person's members not only must\n\nattend   this    membership   meeting,     but   also   must   approve   the\n\nelection-related expenditure before funds can be disbursed.\n\n           If these restrictions were not burdensome enough, Puerto\n\nRico's   election     comptroller   has    issued    regulations    further\n\ndefining the statute's terms.         See Government of Puerto Rico,\n\nOffice   of     the   Electoral   Comptroller,      Regulations    No.   16,\n\nRegulations to Incur Independent Expenditures and to Establish a\n\nSegregated Funds Committee (2012) [hereinafter \"Regulations\"].\n\nThese regulations require the \"membership meeting\" to be \"an\n\nassembly to be held simultaneously in various jurisdictions or\n\ngeographic areas provided they are held on the same day up to\n\n12:00 midnight,\" Regulations, § 7.4 (emphasis added), meaning that\n\n\n\nrestrictions apply to individuals who hold some form of ownership\ninterest or voting stake in entities such as corporations and\npartnerships.    See also id. § 2.004(56) (defining \"juridical\nperson\" as \"includ[ing] corporations, limited liability companies,\npartnerships, cooperatives, trusts, groups of persons organized as\nan association, and labor organizations\").\n\n                                    -25-\n\f\"a majority plus one\" of the entity's members must meet on the\n\nsame day (although not necessarily in the same location).                 The\n\nonly issue that can be discussed at this congregation is the\n\nexpenditure for election-related purposes.               Additionally, the\n\nregulations require that the \"maximum amount\" to be expended must\n\nbe stated in the notice calling for the meeting, as well as\n\ndisclosed to the members at the meeting.              Regulations, § 7.3.\n\nMoreover, noncompliance subjects a juridical person to an array of\n\nsanctions, including daily fines, penalties against the person's\n\nhighest ranking official, and makes \"payment in violation of the\n\nprovisions of [the statute]\" a felony punishable by criminal\n\nfines.\n\n             Law 222 therefore piles burden upon burden in its effort\n\nto restrict the political speech of juridical persons, without any\n\nindication that these measures are remotely necessary to meet the\n\narticulated government interest.             Leaving aside the draconian\n\nnature of the civil and criminal penalties at issue, the rationale\n\nfor many of its requirements is difficult to fathom.               Why is it\n\nnecessary to require a single collective membership meeting to\n\ndiscuss campaign expenditures, or to demand that a majority of the\n\nmembership be present to approve election-related expenditures?\n\nWhy   must   all   members   meet   on   a   single   day?   Why   must   the\n\nmembership discuss only the election-related expenditure at this\n\nmeeting and decline to address any other subjects?            Even if some\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fmeasure of restriction on juridical persons' internal procedures\n\nwere justified, why these specific procedures, and toward what\n\nend?    Given their refusal to defend the merits of such provisions,\n\ndefendants leave all of these crucial questions unanswered.                       In\n\nthe    absence          of   a   discernible   rationale    for   the   challenged\n\nprovisions, we cannot presently conclude that the challenged\n\nprovisions are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\n\ninterest.\n\n                  In sum, Law 222's challenged provisions are not likely\n\nto withstand strict scrutiny.               For the reasons stated, the unions\n\nhave demonstrated a strong likelihood that they will succeed on\n\ntheir First Amendment challenge to Law 222.11\n\n                  3.     Potential for Irreparable Injury\n\n                  There is no need for an extensive analysis of this\n\nelement          of    the   preliminary   injunction   inquiry.        Because   we\n\nconclude that plaintiffs have made a strong showing of likelihood\n\nof success on the merits of their First Amendment claim, it\n\nfollows that the irreparable injury component of the preliminary\n\ninjunction analysis is satisfied as well.                  See Elrod, 427 U.S. at\n\n373; Maceira, 649 F.2d at 18 (\"It is well established that the\n\nloss        of    first      amendment     freedoms   constitutes       irreparable\n\ninjury.\"); see also Phelps-Roper v. Nixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196087\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196087/phelps-roper-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (8th\n\n\n       11\n       Because we conclude that the unions' First Amendment claims\nare likely to succeed on their merits, we do not address their\ncontention that the statute as drafted is void for vagueness.\n\n                                           -27-\n\fCir. 2008) (\"If [plaintiff] can establish a sufficient likelihood\n\nof success on the merits of her First Amendment claim, she will\n\nalso   have    established      irreparable     harm    as   a    result   of   the\n\ndeprivation.\"). The district court therefore erred in its finding\n\nthat plaintiffs failed to make a sufficient showing of irreparable\n\ninjury. See Child Evangelism Fellowship of Minn. v. Minneapolis\n\nSpecial Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1004 (8th Cir. 2012)\n\n(holding that district court's error in finding that plaintiff did\n\nnot establish high likelihood of success on the merits of its\n\nFirst Amendment claim meant that it necessarily erred in its\n\nfinding that plaintiff did not establish irreparable harm).\n\n              4.    Balance of Harms and Public Interest\n\n              The    district   court    blended     the     third   and   fourth\n\ncomponents of the preliminary injunction analysis and determined\n\nthat the balance of the equities and the public interest justified\n\ndenial   of    the     injunction.       The    court   determined     that     the\n\ngovernment     would    be   stripped    of    its   tools   to   implement     its\n\ninformational interest and the public would be left uninformed.\n\nAs noted, this finding is based on a misapprehension by the\n\ndistrict court of the scope of plaintiffs' challenge to Law 222,\n\nsince plaintiffs have explicitly disavowed any challenge to the\n\nlaw's accounting, disclosure, and reporting requirements.\n\n              Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted in Citizens United\n\nthat the suppression of political speech harms not only the\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fspeaker, but also the public to whom the speech would be directed:\n\n\"The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use\n\ninformation to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened\n\nself-government and a necessary means to protect it.\"                  130 S. Ct.\n\nat   898.      To   deprive   plaintiffs of the         right      to speak     will\n\ntherefore have the concomitant effect of depriving \"the public of\n\nthe right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and\n\nspeakers      are   worthy    of   consideration.\"      Id.     at   899.       This\n\ndeprivation     would   be    especially      significant     in     the   election\n\ncontext.      Id. (\"[I]t is inherent in the nature of the political\n\nprocess that voters must be free to obtain information from\n\ndiverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes.\").\n\nThe district court failed to consider the interest of the public\n\nin having a robust debate on the issues of concern to plaintiffs.\n\n              In further explanation of its denial of the preliminary\n\ninjunction, the district court relied heavily on our decision in\n\nRespect Maine PAC in support of its two central findings: (1) that\n\ngranting plaintiffs' requested relief would cause substantial\n\ndisruption, and (2) that plaintiffs' alleged delay in bringing the\n\naction      justified   the   denial    of    relief.     This       reliance    was\n\nmisplaced.      Respect Maine PAC concerned a public matching-funds\n\nscheme for candidates for state office.                  Under that scheme,\n\ncandidates had to declare early in their campaigns whether to\n\naccept public matching funds.            If a candidate opted in to the\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fpublic funds scheme, she had to agree to abide by certain rules,\n\nincluding a $750 cap on individual contributions.           See Cushing v.\n\nMcKee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2475824\"><a href=\"/opinion/2475824/cushing-v-mckee/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148-49 (D. Me. 2010) (describing\n\nprovisions of Maine public matching-funds scheme).               By the time\n\nthe   plaintiffs   in   Respect   Maine    PAC   filed   their    complaint,\n\ncandidates for state office had been on the campaign trail for\n\nmore than eight months, and roughly 280 candidates had opted in to\n\nthe scheme.   See Maine PAC, 622 F.3d at 16.\n\n           The instant case is easily distinguished from Respect\n\nMaine PAC on the issues of timing and delay.             The law at issue\n\nthere had been in place for more than a decade and had endured\n\nseveral election cycles.      Id.    At the time the complaint in the\n\ninstant case was filed, Law 222 was only seven-and-a-half months\n\nold, and it was a response to Citizens United, which dramatically\n\nchanged prior law on the First Amendment rights of corporations\n\nand unions.   As already noted, there is evidence in the record\n\nthat since Law 222 was passed, the unions have been consistently\n\ndeveloping their platform and campaign plans.\n\n           Moreover, the consequences of disrupting the public\n\nfinancing scheme at issue in Respect Maine PAC in the crucial\n\nweeks before the campaign would have been significant and chaotic,\n\nlargely because granting the injunction would have altered rules\n\nthat candidates and the public had rightfully relied upon for\n\nyears.   See Respect Maine PAC, 622 F.3d at 16.            In the instant\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fcase, there is simply no evidence that any such disruption would\n\noccur.    The only consequence of this injunction will be that\n\njuridical persons who were unlawfully prevented from engaging in\n\npolitical speech will now be able to engage in such speech.\n\n                               V. Conclusion\n\n            On October 11, 2012, we granted plaintiffs' motion for\n\nan appellate injunction pending the disposition of this appeal.\n\nThat order enjoined enforcement of Sections 6.007-.010 of Law 222.\n\nNow that we have resolved the plaintiffs' interlocutory appeal, we\n\nhereby   dissolve     the   appellate   injunction          and    remand   to     the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to enter the following order\n\nforthwith:\n\n\n     The defendants are hereby enjoined from enforcing the\n     following provisions of Law 222: 1) Section 6.010 in\n     full; 2) the provision of Section 6.007 that states,\n     \"[i]n order for a juridical person to be able to\n     establish a segregated committee or fund for these\n     purposes, it must comply with the limitations and\n     requirements set forth in Section 6.010 of this Chapter\";\n     and 3) the provision of Section 6.009 that states \"[t]o\n     make contributions or incur in this type of expenditures,\n     a juridical person must obtain authorization of the\n     majority vote of its members, as provided in Section\n     6.010 of this Act.\n\n            We do not enjoin the enforcement of Section 6.008, which\n\nsets limits for contributions from segregated committees and\n\npolitical    action    committees.          Those        limits    have   not    been\n\nchallenged    here.    Similarly,    nothing        in    our     order   should    be\n\nconstrued    to   undermine   any   disclosure           requirements      in   other\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fsections of Law 222.

However, it may establish, organize, and\nadminister a committee, to be known as a segregated committee or\nfund that, for the purposes of contributions and expenditures,\nshall be treated as a public action committee that must be\nregistered in the Office of the Election Comptroller, render\nreports, and comply with all requirements imposed under this Act.\nThus, its members, employees, and their immediate family or\nrelated persons may make contributions that shall be deposited in\nthe account established and registered in the Office of the\nElection Comptroller. In order for a juridical person to be able\nto establish a segregated committee or fund for these purposes, it\nmust comply with the limitations and requirements set forth in\nSection 6.010 of this Chapter. The committee, organization, or\ncitizen group may make donations from said account to political\nparties, aspirants, candidates, and campaign committees and\nauthorized committees, as well as to political action committees\nmaking contributions to any of them.\nP.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 625g.\n\nSection 6.008.-Limits for Segregated Committees and Public Action\nCommittees.-\n\nSegregated committees or funds may make contributions to any\npolitical party, aspirant, candidate, campaign committee, and\nauthorized committees, and to any authorized agent and\nrepresentative thereof, provided that the contributions do not\nexceed the limits established in this Act for natural persons or\naggregates. These limits shall also apply to contributions made by\nmembers to a juridical person that shall use them to make a\ncontribution to a political party, aspirant, candidate, campaign\ncommittee, and authorized committee, or to any authorized agent\nand representative thereof. Two (2) or more political action\ncommittees shall be deemed to be one (1) single committee if they\nhave been established by the same person or group of persons, are\ncontrolled by the same person or group of persons, or share\nofficials, directors, or employees.\n\n                              -33-\n\fP.R. Stat.

However, in these cases, the provisions of Section 6.001\nof this Act shall apply. To make contributions or incur in this\ntype of expenditures, a juridical person must obtain the\nauthorization of the majority vote of its members, as provided in\nSection 6.010 of this Act.\nP.R. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 625i.\n\nSection 6.010.-Authorization to Establish a Segregated Committee\nor Fund or to Incur Expenditures of Election-related Purposes.-\n\n1. The juridical person must hold a membership meeting. The call\nfor such meeting shall be issued fifteen (15) days before the\nholding thereof and shall only include this authorization purpose.\n\n2. At the meeting, the majority plus one of the total members of\nthe entity, whether a corporation, cooperative, partnership,\nassociation, or labor organization, shall approve by direct and\nsecret vote the use of the money or property of the entity for\nelection-related purposes. Under no circumstances shall a vote\nthat has not been cast be counted as a vote in favor of the use of\nmoney or the property for election-related purposes.\n\n3. For such authorization, the members shall be informed of the\npurposes of the electioneering communication or communications\nthat shall be paid for, including the specific purpose of the\nmessages to be transmitted and the amount of money that shall be\nearmarked to such campaign. Before voting at the meeting, the\nmembers shall be clearly informed of whether they, as an\norganization, intend to support, oppose, or advocate for the\nelection or defeat or a political party, ideology, aspirant, or\ncandidate. No organizational structures shall be created to evade\nthe requirement of obtaining the informed consent of the members\nof any juridical person.\n\n4. The board of directors and the highest ranking official of the\njuridical person in question shall certify, under oath and under\npenalty of contempt, that all the requirements of this Section\nwere met. The certification shall include the notice sent to all\n\n                              -34-\n\fmembers and the date thereof, the date and the place of the\nmeeting, the total number of members of the juridical person, the\nnumber of members that attended the meeting, the exact results of\nthe voting, and an accurate and detailed description of the\ninformation regarding the amount of money or property that was\napproved. This sworn certification shall state the veracity and\naccuracy of the information furnished. In addition, the Election\nComptroller shall immediately publish said certification over the\nInternet.\n\n5. Said certification shall be remitted, on the business day\nfollowing the voting, to the Office of the Election Comptroller.\nAfter obtaining the corresponding authorization and remitting the\naforementioned certification, the entity shall register in the\nOffice of the Election Comptroller as an entity that intends to\nincur expenditures for election-related purposes or make\ncontributions,   and   render  the   appropriate   reports.   The\nregistration of such entity shall be carried out according to the\ndemands and requirements of a Political Action Committee.\n\n6. Any executive, director, manager, managing partner, and the\nhighest ranking official thereof at the time the contribution or\nexpenditure was made for election-related purposes in violation of\nthis Section shall be responsible for compensating the juridical\nperson ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or the amount of the\ncontribution or expenditure, plus any lawfully applicable\ninterest, whichever is higher. This responsibility shall be\nseparate and independent from any other fine or offense set forth\nin this or any other Act. Any member of the juridical person may\nrequest the refund established in this Section to the Court. Any\nmember of the juridical person may file a complaint, under oath,\nwith the Office of the Election Comptroller to report any\nviolations of this Section, or resort to the Court in the event\nthat his/her complaint is not addressed.\n\n7.
