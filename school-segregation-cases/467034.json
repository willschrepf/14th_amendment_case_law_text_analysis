Plaintiff-Appellee Martinique\nStoudemire (“Plaintiff” or “Stoudemire”), a double amputee and former prisoner at\nHuron Valley Women’s Correctional Facility (“Huron”) in Ypsilanti, Michigan, brought\nthe instant case against the Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) and\nMDOC-associated officers, doctors, and nurses, asserting violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132; and Mich. Comp.\nLaws § 330.1722. Stoudemire, who has suffered from autoimmune and kidney disorders\nsince she was a youth, alleges that, while she was an inmate at Huron, she underwent\nthree separate amputations as a result of inadequate health care by the Defendants, was\nplaced in a segregation unit immediately following her final amputation that lacked\naccommodations for disabled persons, and was subjected to a strip search that served no\nlegitimate penological purpose. Defendant-Appellants Susan Davis (“Davis”), the\nwarden who allegedly sanctioned Stoudemire’s placement in segregation, and Ariel N.\nDunagan (“Dunagan”), the corrections officer who conducted the strip search, appeal\nfrom the order of the district court denying them summary judgment on their qualified\nimmunity defenses to Stoudemire’s § 1983 claims against them.1 Stoudemire v. Mich.\nDep’t of Corr., No. 07-15387, 2011 WL 1303418 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2011). The\ndistrict court did not resolve Stoudemire’s state law claims; Davis and Dunagan reassert\ntheir governmental immunity defense to those claims. For the following reasons, we\nVACATE the denial of qualified immunity as to Davis, AFFIRM the denial of qualified\nimmunity as to Dunagan, and REMAND with instructions for the district court to\naddress Davis’s qualified immunity defense and Davis’s and Dunagan’s state law\ndefenses in a manner not inconsistent with this Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n          The other Defendants who were initially named as appellants moved to be dismissed from this\nappeal and were dismissed by order of this court on December 4, 2012.\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                    Page 3\n\n\n               I. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Pursuant to the “collateral order” doctrine, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291 to review the district court’s interlocutory denial of qualified immunity only to\nthe extent that it turns on an issue of law. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 529-30\n(1985). The district court’s characterization of the basis for its ruling is not dispositive.\nSee Livermore ex rel. Rohm v. Lubelan, 476 F.3d 397, 402-03 (6th Cir. 2007). Thus, our\njurisdiction is not necessarily defeated by the fact that the district court denied a\ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that there is a genuine issue\nof material fact. Id. at 402. In such a case, we may nevertheless exercise appellate\njurisdiction over purely legal questions related to qualified immunity. Dickerson v.\nMcClellan, 101 F.3d 1151, 1157 (6th Cir. 1996). This is so even where the defendant\nimpermissibly relies on disputed facts on appeal; “this court can ignore the defendant’s\nattempts to dispute the facts and nonetheless resolve the legal issue [raised], obviating\nthe need to dismiss the entire appeal for lack of jurisdiction.” Estate of Carter v. City\nof Detroit, 408 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir. 2005); see also Thompson v. Grida, 656 F.3d 365,\n367 (6th Cir. 2011) (explaining that a defendant appealing denial of summary judgment\non qualified immunity grounds must be willing to concede the most favorable view of\nthe facts to the plaintiff). However, “[m]ere conclusory statements that the officers\nconstrue the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff cannot confer jurisdiction\nupon this Court.” Thompson, 656 F.3d at 368.\n\n        We review de novo a district court’s denial of a defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds. See Tucker v. City of Richmond, 388 F.3d\n216, 219 (6th Cir. 2004). We also review de novo the question of whether a defendant\nis entitled to governmental immunity under Michigan law. Reilly v. Vadlamudi,\n680 F.3d 617, 622 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Herman v. City of Detroit, 680 N.W.2d 71, 74\n(Mich. Ct. App. 2004)).\n\n        Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).      We determine materiality by reference to the applicable\n\fNo. 11-1588         Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                   Page 4\n\n\nsubstantive law, and thus “[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the\nsuit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). Summary judgment is not\nappropriate “if the dispute about a material fact is ‘genuine,’ that is, if the evidence is\nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id.; see also\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In reviewing a summary judgment motion, we view all facts and\ndraw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\nSee Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007). In the qualified immunity context, “this\nusually means adopting . . . the plaintiff’s version of the facts,” id., unless the plaintiff’s\nversion is “blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe\nit . . . .” Id. at 380.\n\n                             II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n                            A. Stoudemire’s Medical History\n\n         When twenty-three-year-old Martinique Stoudemire entered the MDOC system\nin July 2002, she came with a long and well-documented history of health problems.\nStoudemire suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic and painful\nautoimmune disease; hypercoagulapathy, a related disorder characterized by a tendency\nto develop blood clots; and depression. Without proper care, Stoudemire bore a\nsignificant risk of experiencing kidney and liver damage, heart attacks, amputations, and\nchronic pain.\n\n         Stoudemire’s health quickly deteriorated. During her five years at Huron, she\nexperienced a heart attack, liver failure, and a number of life-threatening embolisms.\nShe underwent three amputations, eventually losing both legs below the knee. By the\ntime of her parole in August of 2007, she also suffered from chronic depression, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and a number of conditions related to medications she had\nreceived during her incarceration. Stoudemire attributes her health complications to the\nalleged failure of MDOC staff members and associated doctors and nurses to provide her\nwith adequate health care while she was incarcerated. For the purposes of this appeal,\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 5\n\n\nhowever, we focus on the events following Stoudemire’s final amputation in December\n2006, when her stump and buttock became infected with Methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus Aureas (“MRSA”) and she was quarantined in Huron’s segregation unit.\n\n              B. Stoudemire’s Placement in Huron’s Segregation Unit\n\n         According to an April 14, 2005, Memorandum from Richard D. Russell,\nAdministrator of the MDOC Health Care Bureau, “all prisoners with a documented\nculture positive for MRSA must be quarantined.” The policy provides that responsible\nstaff members must notify the warden of the particular facility of a confirmed MRSA\ncase in order to initiate the quarantine process. If health care staff determine that\nmedical quarantine is necessary, the warden is responsible for isolating the infected\ninmates. The warden has the discretion to choose a quarantine location within the prison\nand may also opt to send infected inmates to another site. Davis designated Huron’s\nsegregation unit, which prisoners and guards call “the hole,” as a quarantine location.\nThe segregation unit is normally used for isolating prisoners who have violated prison\nrules.\n\n         Stoudemire spent roughly two weeks in quarantine as a consequence of her\nMRSA infection. At her deposition, Davis testified that she “was probably aware at the\ntime” that Stoudemire had been placed in segregation for medical purposes but that she\n“[didn’t] recall specifically.”\n\n         Stoudemire alleges that she received extremely poor medical care while in\nsegregation. The segregation cells were not equipped to accommodate disabled patients.\nStoudemire was never provided with any assistive devices that might have allowed her\nto safely move between her bed, wheelchair, toilet, and shower. There was no call\nbutton, so Stoudemire had to shout when she needed assistance. She alleges that the\nmedical staff treated her with contempt. They accused her of malingering and responded\nwith hostility whenever she sought assistance. As a result, Stoudemire was left to care\nfor herself. She was forced to crawl from her bed to the toilet. On one occasion, she had\nto urinate into a bowl. On another occasion, she defecated on herself. The staff\nneglected Stoudemire’s hygiene. She received only one shower during her two weeks\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 6\n\n\nin segregation and was required to dress her wounds herself, which put her at risk of\ninfection.\n\n       According to one of Plaintiff’s experts, Stoudemire received “very little medical\nrounding” while she was in the segregation unit, which was “a terrible place to put an\namputee.” Davis testified that, in cases where a physically handicapped prisoner was\nplaced in a segregation cell, she “would check the logbook to make sure that medical\nprofessionals had been through at least daily to see the prisoner for however often the\nprisoner’s particular need was.” Davis also testified that she would “check to make sure\nthat my deputy warden or [an assistant deputy warden] had been through . . . [and]\npersonally observed that prisoner to make sure that, you know, they weren’t hanging\nthemselves in the cell or what have you.”\n\n                     C. The Strip Search by Officer Dunagan\n\n       Stoudemire also challenges the constitutionality of a February 10, 2007, strip\nsearch performed by Officer Dunagan. Stoudemire’s account is as follows: Stoudemire\nwas in the infirmary’s common area, waiting to be escorted to an aerobics class.\nDunagan approached and announced her intention to conduct a strip search. When\nStoudemire asked Dunagan for a reason for the search, Dunagan said, “[b]ecause I can.”\nDunagan took Stoudemire to Stoudemire’s cell. Dunagan did not cover the window on\nthe cell door, which looked out onto a busy hallway. Dunagan and Stoudemire were\npositioned so that passers-by had an unobstructed view of Stoudemire. Dunagan\n“displayed pleasure at [Stoudemire’s] discomfort,” smirking throughout the search.\nStoudemire stripped down to her underpants and removed her prosthetic legs. She could\nhear people in the hallway and realized that they could see her. She felt humiliated.\nDunagan did not find any contraband.\n\n       Dunagan offers a markedly different account of the search. According to\nDunagan, she asked Stoudemire to submit to a pat-down search rather than a strip search.\nStoudemire “refused and sped off in her wheelchair to her room, saying that she had to\nchange her shirt before I [did] my pat-down search.” Dunagan followed Stoudemire to\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                   Page 7\n\n\nher cell and decided to conduct a strip search because Stoudemire had tried to evade the\npat-down search. Dunagan did not cover the cell-door window, but she did position\nherself between the window and Stoudemire, thereby blocking passers-by from seeing\nStoudemire. Stoudemire stripped down to her brassiere and underpants. Dunagan\ndiscovered a cigarette and matches–contraband items–in Stoudemire’s hand. She issued\nStoudemire a misconduct ticket.\n\n       Some facts are not in dispute. The day after the search, Stoudemire filed a\ngrievance, alleging that Dunagan’s conduct constituted sexual harassment.             The\ngrievance was denied, but Dunagan received an official reprimand for conducting the\nsearch in violation of MDOC Policy Directive 4.04.110 ¶ U, which states that “[a] strip\nsearch shall be conducted in a place which prevents the search from being observed by\nthose not assisting in that search . . . .” The reprimand notes that other persons could\nhave observed Stoudemire during the search because Dunagan did not block the window\non the door, and that Dunagan admitted that such “visual contact” was possible. In\naddition, MDOC Policy Directive 4.07.112 ¶ GG requires that, when an officer finds\ncontraband, the contraband must be confiscated and a contraband removal record must\nbe issued to the prisoner, as well as either a misconduct report or a notice of intent to\nconduct an administrative hearing. The record does not contain copies of any such\ndocuments.\n\n                                    III. ANALYSIS\n\n                      A. Section 1983 and Qualified Immunity\n\n       Section 1983 provides “a cause of action for deprivation under color of state law,\nof any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates.” Jones v. Muskegon Cnty., 625 F.3d 935, 940-41 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). However, “[u]nder the doctrine of qualified\nimmunity, ‘government officials performing discretionary functions generally are\nshielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                    Page 8\n\n\nknown.’” Phillips v. Roane Cnty., 534 F.3d 531, 538 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Harlow\nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). In resolving a government official’s qualified\nimmunity claims, we look to whether (1) the facts that the plaintiff has alleged or shown\nestablish the violation of a constitutional right, and (2) the right at issue was “clearly\nestablished” at the time of the alleged misconduct. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223,\n232 (2009). This court has discretion to decide “which of the two prongs of the qualified\nimmunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular\ncase at hand.” Id. at 236.\n\n        In evaluating whether a constitutional right was clearly established, “[t]he key\ndetermination is whether a defendant moving for summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity grounds was on notice that his alleged actions were unconstitutional.” Grawey\nv. Drury, 567 F.3d 302, 313 (6th Cir. 2009). The Supreme Court has stressed that the\n“contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.\n635, 640 (1987). This does not mean that “an official action is protected by qualified\nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.” Id.\n(citing Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 535 n.12). Rather, it means that “in light of pre-existing law\nthe unlawfulness must be apparent.” Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640 (collecting cases);\nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2083 (2011) (“We do not require a case directly on\npoint, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question\nbeyond debate.”). This court has explained that a plaintiff has “two paths for showing\nthat officers were on notice that they were violating a ‘clearly established’ constitutional\nright—where the violation was sufficiently obvious under the general standards of\nconstitutional care that the plaintiff need not show a body of materially similar case law,\n. . . and where the violation is shown by the failure to adhere to a particularized body of\nprecedent that squarely governs the case here.” Lyons v. City of Xenia, 417 F.3d 565,\n579 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198-200 (2004)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). In other words, the “clearly established” prong must be\napplied “in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.”\n\fNo. 11-1588        Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                 Page 9\n\n\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), overruled on other grounds by Pearson,\n555 U.S. at 236.\n\n       A defendant bears the initial burden of putting forth facts that suggest that he was\nacting within the scope of his discretionary authority. Rich v. City of Mayfield Heights,\n955 F.2d 1092, 1095 (6th Cir. 1992). Ultimately, however, the “burden of proof is on\nthe plaintiff to show that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.” Id.\n\n                                   B. The Davis Appeal\n\n       Stoudemire alleges that the conditions of her confinement while in quarantine\nviolated her Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The\nEighth Amendment protects inmates by “impos[ing] duties on [prison] officials, who\nmust provide humane conditions of confinement” and “adequate food, clothing, shelter,\nand medical care and . . . ‘take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the\ninmates.’” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer,\n468 U.S. 517, 526-527 (1984)). However, “[a]n inmate may bring a § 1983 claim under\nthe Eighth Amendment only where he can show that a state official acted with\n‘deliberate indifference’ to his ‘medical needs.’” Gibson v. Moskowitz, 523 F.3d 657,\n661 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, 439 F.3d 280, 286 (6th Cir.\n2006)). Deliberate indifference requires more than a showing of “mere mistreatment or\nnegligence.” Id. As the Supreme Court has explained,\n\n       a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for\n       denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official\n       knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the\n       official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be\n       drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also\n       draw that inference.\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837. On appeal, Davis argues that the district court erred in denying\nher qualified immunity on Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement\nclaim under § 1983 because Stoudemire did not show that Davis was deliberately\nindifferent to Stoudemire’s medical needs.\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                  Page 10\n\n\n        The district court found that,\n\n        when viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Stoudemire, the\n        evidence supports her argument (i.e., she suffered from a medical\n        condition in the form of a double amputation and immediate infection,\n        for which the MDOC Defendants failed to reasonably accommodate by\n        providing her with (1) assistive facilities, (2) training on how to care for\n        herself, and (3) other aids that would assist her in meeting her basic\n        health and safety needs).\n\nStoudemire, 2011 WL 1303418, at *8.            The court also found that “the MDOC\nDefendants neglected to make any reasonable adjustments for her as a brand-new double\namputee who could not ambulate within her segregated cell without the assistance of\nanother person.” Id. The court then concluded that Stoudemire had “sufficiently alleged\nthe violation of a clearly established right.” Id. As a result of a series of stipulations\nand Stoudemire’s decision not to challenge a portion of the Defendant’s motion to\ndismiss, Stoudemire had effectively withdrawn her Eighth Amendment claim (arising\nfrom her quarantine) against all but Davis; in a footnote, the district court noted that “the\nanalysis by the court applies only to Davis.” Id. at *8 n.7. Nonetheless, the district court\ndenied qualified immunity for the “Defendants.” The court also denied Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on Stoudemire’s ADA claim.\n\n            1. Issues Regarding Whether Claim Properly Before the Court\n\n        Davis and Stoudemire both argue that we cannot consider the merits of\nStoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim. According to Davis, Stoudemire never actually\npleaded such a claim; instead, the district court improperly “created” an Eighth\nAmendment claim by relying on the facts Stoudemire alleged solely in support of her\nADA claim. Stoudemire argues that Davis failed to raise qualified immunity as a\ndefense to Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim and that the court therefore lacks\njurisdiction over Davis’s appeal. See Mingus v. Butler, 591 F.3d 474, 483-84 (6th Cir.\n2010) (declining to address defendant’s assertion of qualified immunity where the\ndefense was not initially presented to the court). We review de novo whether a given\nset of pleaded facts supports a claim. See, e.g., Carter v. Ford Motor Co., 561 F.3d 562,\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 11\n\n\n565-66 (6th Cir. 2009). We also review de novo whether a given set of facts constitutes\nwaiver. See Karam v. Sagemark Consulting, Inc., 383 F.3d 421, 426 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n       We reject Davis’s contention that the district court conflated or “confused”\nStoudemire’s ADA claim with her Eighth Amendment claim. The district court\ncorrectly stated that Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim was based on “the same\nmisconduct which gives rise to her claims under the ADA.” Stoudemire, 2011 WL\n1303418, at *8. The court found that “the claimed misconduct . . . if true, supports\nindependent causes of action under Title II [of the ADA] and the Eighth Amendment.”\nId. at *6. Clearly, the district court was not “confuse[d],” and did not conflate the ADA\nclaim with the Eighth Amendment claim, as Davis argues. Rather, the district court\nproperly construed Stoudemire’s Complaint “so as to do justice.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e);\nsee also Minger v. Green, 239 F.3d 793, 799 (“[T]he Rules require that we not rely\nsolely on labels in a complaint, but that we probe deeper and examine the substance of\nthe complaint.”).\n\n       We also reject Stoudemire’s contention that Davis did not raise qualified\nimmunity as a defense. Stoudemire’s argument rests entirely on the following sentence\nin Defendants’ motion before the district court: “Had the plaintiff alleged this as a\nconstitutional violation, the defendants would respond that they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity because clearly established law does not prohibit quarantining a prisoner to\nprotect the prison population from infection.” The sentence must be read in the context\nof the paragraph, which begins: “As to the remainder of the claims, the defendants are\nalso entitled to qualified immunity and summary judgment.” Taken together, these\nsentences clearly suffice as an assertion of qualified immunity. In addition, we have\npreviously declined to dismiss interlocutory appeals on waiver grounds where the district\ncourt made no findings of waiver, and we decline to do so here. See, e.g., Yates v. City\nof Cleveland, 941 F.2d 444, 449 (6th Cir. 1991) (declining to dispose of appeal on\nwaiver grounds where district court “made no findings of . . . waiver” regarding qualified\nimmunity defense); Taylor v. Mich. Dep’t of Corr., 14 F.3d 602, *2 (6th Cir.1993)\n(declining to address waiver issue that was not addressed by the district court, even\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                 Page 12\n\n\nthough “sloppy draftsmanship” in summary judgment brief brought defendant\n“dangerously close” to waiving defense).\n\n                 2. Discussion of Davis’s Qualified Immunity Defense\n\n       Although we have jurisdiction to consider Davis’s qualified immunity defense,\n“it is well-settled that qualified immunity must be assessed in the context of each\nindividual’s specific conduct.” Reilly, 680 F.3d at 624; see also Bishop v. Hackel,\n636 F.3d 757, 767 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding that district court erred in failing to make\nindividualized assessment for purposes of subjective component under Farmer);\nPhillips, 534 F.3d at 542 (“Where, as here, the district court is faced with multiple\ndefendants asserting qualified immunity defenses, the court should consider whether\neach individual defendant had a sufficiently culpable state of mind.”). Accordingly, the\nquestion of whether an official possessed the requisite knowledge and culpable mental\nstate to sustain a deliberate indifference claim “must be addressed for each officer\nindividually.” Garretson v. City of Madison Heights, 407 F.3d 789, 797 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n       In order to be liable in this case, Davis must have “both be[en] aware of facts\nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exist[ed],\nand [s]he must also [have] draw[n that] inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. Though\nthe district court stated in a footnote that its ruling only applied to Davis, since the\nPlaintiff by stipulation or otherwise had conceded its claims against the other defendants,\nas stated above, it denied qualified immunity for “Defendants.” In so doing, the court\ndid not conduct a particularized analysis of whether Davis was deliberately indifferent\nto the conditions of Stoudemire’s confinement while in quarantine. The district court\ndid not mention any facts in the record that specifically pertained to Davis, nor did the\ncourt make any findings regarding Davis’s knowledge or mental state. Even if we were\nto assume that the district court’s analysis satisfactorily addressed the objective element\nof Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim–“the existence of a sufficiently serious\nmedical need,” Harrison v. Ash, 539 F.3d 510, 518 (6th Cir. 2008)–clearly there was no\ndiscussion of the subjective element of the claim: whether Davis, the warden, had “a\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                 Page 13\n\n\nsufficiently culpable state of mind in denying [Stoudemire] medical care.” Blackmore\nv. Kalamazoo Cnty., 390 F.3d 890, 895 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n       Although this court has the authority to “undertake a cumbersome review of the\nrecord to determine what facts the district court, in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party, likely assumed,” Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319 (1995), the best\ncourse is to remand “for the district court to set forth with precision the basis for its\ndecision.” Poe v. Haydon, 853 F.2d 418, 426 (6th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 109 S. Ct.\n788 (1989); see also Crutcher v. Kentucky, 883 F.2d 502, 503 (6th Cir. 1989); Dominque\nv. Telb, 831 F.2d 673, 677 (6th Cir. 1987). We therefore vacate and remand to the\ndistrict court for the purpose of properly evaluating Davis’s qualified immunity defense.\n\n                                 C. Dunagan’s Appeal\n\n       Dunagan appeals the district court’s denial of qualified immunity in regard to\nStoudemire’s § 1983 claim relating to the 2007 strip search. In contrast to its resolution\nof Davis’s qualified immunity defense, the district court addressed Dunagan’s defense\nwith sufficient particularity to enable our review. Viewing the record in the light most\nfavorable to Stoudemire, the district court held that “Dunagan should have been on\nnotice that [the strip search] would have been unreasonable under the circumstances and\nnot based on a reasonable penological interest of security and order.” Stoudemire,\n2011 WL 1303418, at *9. On appeal, Dunagan argues that Stoudemire has failed to\n“show that there is clearly established law prohibiting the conduct in question,”\nemphasizing that Stoudemire has presented no case holding that a same-sex strip search\nof a prisoner was unlawful. Stoudemire’s alleged injury, however, is not tied to\nDunagan’s gender. Rather, Stoudemire’s focus is on evidence that suggests that the\nsearch was “undertaken to harass or humiliate” and not for any legitimate purpose.\nAccording to Stoudemire, the relevant constitutional question is not whether clearly\nestablished law proscribes same-sex strip searches in prisons, but whether clearly\nestablished law proscribes a strip search that served no legitimate penological purpose\nand was intended only to harass. Dunagan focuses on whether the law regarding same-\nsex strip searches is “clearly established” for qualified immunity purposes. However,\n\fNo. 11-1588         Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                             Page 14\n\n\nthe applicable inquiry is whether the strip search was reasonable under the circumstances\nand whether Stoudemire’s constitutional rights in this regard were clearly established at\nthe time of the search. We address both issues.\n\n                                    1. Constitutional Violation\n\n         Because “the difficulties of operating a [prison] must not be underestimated by\nthe courts,” Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cnty. of Burlington, 132 S. Ct.\n1510, 1515 (2012), we review a prisoner’s constitutional claims under a standard that\naffords deference to the judgments of correctional officers, “who must have substantial\ndiscretion to devise reasonable solutions to the problems they face.” Id.; see also\nFlagner v. Wilkinson, 241 F.3d 475, 481 (6th Cir. 2001). A prison’s regulations need\nonly be “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner v. Safley,\n482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987). We review a correctional officer’s discretionary actions under\nessentially the same deferential standard. Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1516. But we must not\nconfuse deference with abdication: “[F]ederal courts must take cognizance of the valid\nconstitutional claims of prison inmates.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 84. As we have noted, “a\nconvicted prisoner maintains some reasonable expectations of privacy while in prison\n. . . even though those privacy rights may be less than those enjoyed by non-prisoners.”\nCornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912, 916 (6th Cir. 1992); see also Hutchins v.\nMcDaniels, 512 F.3d 193, 196 (5th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he Fourth Amendment protects\nprisoners from searches and seizures that go beyond legitimate penological interests.\nSearches of prisoners must be conducted in a manner that is reasonable under the facts\nand circumstances in which they are performed.” (internal citation omitted)).2 The\n\n\n\n         2\n           Dunagan cites Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), for the proposition that “prisoners have\nno Fourth Amendment right to privacy.” Dunagan misapprehends the scope of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision. In Hudson, the Court “addressed the question of whether prison officials could perform random\nsearches of inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect a particular individual of concealing\na prohibited item.” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1516 (emphasis added). The Court held that “society is not\nprepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his\nprison cell.” Hudson, 468 U.S. at 526 (emphasis added). Hudson stands for the proposition that “prisoners\nhave no reasonable expectation of privacy protecting their cells from unreasonable searches.” Kent v.\nJohnson, 821 F.2d 1220, 1226 (6th Cir. 1987) (emphasis added). Our cases have long made clear that that\n“a convicted prisoner maintains some reasonable expectations of privacy while in prison,” and that Hudson\ndid not extinguish a prisoner’s Fourth Amendment right to bodily privacy. Cornwell, 963 F.2d at 916 (6th\nCir. 1992); see also, e.g., Everson v. Mich. Dept. of Corr., 391 F.3d 737, 757 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\fNo. 11-1588        Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                  Page 15\n\n\nSupreme Court instructs us that, where a prisoner alleges a constitutionally unreasonable\nsearch,\n\n          [t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment . . . requires a\n          balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\n          personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\n          the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\n          justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\n\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). Accordingly, we first examine the scope,\nmanner, and location of the search–as well as the justification for initiating it–in order\nto assess the degree to which it invaded the prisoner’s right to privacy. We next evaluate\nthe need for the search, giving due deference to the correctional officer’s exercise of her\ndiscretionary functions. Finally, we determine whether the search was reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests by weighing the need against the invasion.\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1516. Because Stoudemire’s account of the search has not been\n“blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it,” Scott,\n550 U.S. at 380, the procedural posture of this appeal requires us to accept Stoudemire’s\nversion of the events.\n\n                         (a) Degree of Invasion of Personal Rights\n\n          The scope of the search frames our analysis of the other Bell factors. Had\nDunagan conducted a pat-down search or a search of Stoudemire’s room, it is doubtful\nthat her actions would rise to the level of a constitutional violation. However, “a strip\nsearch, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well\nas an offense to the dignity of the individual.” Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st\nCir. 1996). It is a practice that “instinctively gives us . . . pause,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 558,\nsince “[u]ndergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliating and deeply offensive\nto many . . . .” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1524 (Alito, J., concurring). To the extent that\nprisoners have some right, however diminished, “to be secure in their persons . . . against\nunreasonable searches,” U.S. Const. amend IV, a strip search is a particularly extreme\ninvasion of that right. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-60. The facts of Dunagan’s strip search of\nStoudemire tell us as much.\n\fNo. 11-1588         Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                          Page 16\n\n\n         The location of the strip search made it more invasive. Because Dunagan did not\nblock the window of the cell, the search did not take place in a private location; as\nDunagan admitted, people in the hall could see Stoudemire naked, her prosthetic legs\nremoved. Cf. Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1089 (6th Cir. 1983) (finding strip search\nthat “was carried out discreetly and in privacy” to be unobtrusive). Dunagan received\na reprimand for her failure to conduct the strip search “in a place which prevent[ed] the\nsearch from being observed by those not assisting in that search,” in violation of the\nMDOC’s rules. The MDOC rule and Dunagan’s reprimand underscore the obvious: a\nstrip search is more invasive when it is performed where other people can see the person\nbeing stripped.3 See, e.g., Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 364 (4th Cir. 2001); Iskander\nv. Vill. of Forest Park, 690 F.2d 126, 129 (7th Cir. 1982).\n\n         Dunagan’s manner also made the search somewhat more invasive. Stoudemire\nhighlights two facts in this regard: that Dunagan refused to tell Stoudemire her reasons\nfor initiating the search and that Dunagan smirked during the search. Although these\nfacts are hardly dispositive, see Roden v. Sowders, 84 F. App’x 611, 613 (6th Cir. 2003)\n(“Even if [the defendant prison guard] did laugh, the strip search is not rendered\nconstitutionally invalid thereby.”), they may, in context, suggest personal animus and\nimplicate the dignitary interest “inherent in the privacy component of the Fourth\nAmendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches.” Brannum v. Overton Cnty.\nSch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 499 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n                            (b) The Degree of Need for the Search\n\n         Our next step is to evaluate the need for the particular search. Bell, 441 U.S. at\n559. Unquestionably, “detect[ing] and deter[ing] the possession of contraband” is a\nlegitimate penological objective. Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1517. Absent proof to the\ncontrary, we must assume that a search of a prisoner is initiated in an effort to detect and\ndeter contraband. See Hudson, 468 U.S. at 529 (quoting Marrero v. Commonwealth, 284\nS.E.2d 809, 811 (Va. 1981)) (“For one to advocate that prison searches must be\n\n         3\n          We note that prisoners enjoy no special privacy rights in their cells. See Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n526; United States v. Smith, 526 F. 3d 306, 309 (6th Cir. 2008). Our focus, however, is not on the type\nof room but on the degree of privacy the location actually provided during the search.\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                  Page 17\n\n\nconducted only . . . when suspicion is directed at a particular inmate is to ignore the\nrealities of prison operation.”). But to say that Dunagan had a legitimate justification for\nsearching, or even strip searching, Stoudemire does not conclude our inquiry. We must\nfurther determine “the need for the particular search” at issue. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559\n(emphasis added).\n\n        The question, then, is whether any exigent circumstances compelled Dunagan\nto strip search Stoudemire in view of other inmates and prison personnel. The record\nsuggests no such exigencies. As Dunagan’s reprimand shows, no emergency made such\na search necessary. Cf., Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 448-49 (1st Cir. 1991)\n(holding that visual body cavity searches, some of which were conducted in view of\nguards of the opposite sex, did not violate clearly established rights where searches were\nconducted in response to what plaintiff conceded was a “riot” situation). There is no\nevidence that Dunagan chose the search location out of concern for Dunagan’s own\nsafety. Cf. Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 333 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding\nlegitimate penological justification for conducting searches in public hallways where\nonly alternative in the prison unit would have presented a risk to officer safety).\nStoudemire did not have “a history of maladaptive behavior within prison” that might\nweigh in favor of conducting the search. Id. at 332 (collecting cases). Also, there were\nno time or resource constraints that supported the need for such an ad hoc search.\nAccordingly, although Dunagan had a valid reason for searching Stoudemire, no special\ncircumstances provided additional justifications for strip searching Stoudemire where\nothers could see her naked.\n\n        On balance, although the “test of reasonableness . . . is not capable of precise\ndefinition,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, particularly as applied to prisoners, we conclude that,\ntaking the facts as Stoudemire alleged them, she has established a constitutional\nviolation. In so deciding, we do not underestimate the importance of deterring and\ndetecting contraband in prisons, nor have we forgotten to afford Dunagan the deference\ndue to a correctional officer executing a difficult discretionary responsibility. But it is\nsettled that the law demands an adequate need for a strip search, and, depending on the\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 18\n\n\ncircumstances and context, restricts the scope, manner, and place of the search. Id.\nHere, the excessively invasive nature of the search outweighed any need to conduct it\nin such a fashion.\n\n       It is important to emphasize two points. First, it is unquestionable that the\nSupreme Court and lower courts have sanctioned a wide range of practices—many of\nthem intrusive—that are designed to further legitimate penological interests. See, e.g.,\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1518-20 (discussing significant interests for conducting strip\nsearches as part of inmate booking process); Hudson, 468 U.S. at 529 (stating that\n“wholly random searches [of prison cells] are essential to the effective security of penal\ninstitutions”); Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 (holding that routine visual body cavity searches\nafter contact visits do not violate the Fourth Amendment). Second, it is important to\nnote that the MDOC’s policies are not under review. Had Dunagan followed procedure,\nshe would not have violated Stoudemire’s Fourth Amendment rights.                We are\nconsidering the acts of a single corrections officer sued in her individual capacity.\nNormally, separation of powers and federalism concerns weigh heavily in our review of\nprison regulations. Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85. But we are not dealing with a policy or\nwide-ranging regulation, as indicated in the cases cited above. Instead, the “[f]actual\nnuances” of this case determine whether Dunagan violated Stoudemire’s personal rights.\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523 (Roberts, C.J., concurring); see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 560.\nOur holding is confined to the facts, viewed most favorably to the inmate, of the\nparticular search under review.\n\n              2. Whether Dunagan Violated a “Clearly Established” Right\n\n       As noted above, Dunagan’s arguments on appeal focus primarily on the question\nof whether Stoudemire has satisfied the “clearly established” prong of the qualified\nimmunity analysis in view of the fact that she does not cite any cases involving same-sex\nstrip searches. While it is true that this court has stated that an expectation of privacy\nmay, in the prison context, be particularly reasonable “where those claims are related to\nforced exposure to strangers of the opposite sex,” Cornwell, 963 F.2d at 916, Dunagan\nis mistaken in suggesting that the gender of the parties involved is wholly dispositive of\n\fNo. 11-1588        Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                       Page 19\n\n\nthe constitutional question. The gender of the parties is just one fact for the court to\nconsider in determining the reasonableness of a given search or the legitimacy of a\nchallenged practice. See, e.g., Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333-34 (noting that “[s]hielding\none’s unclothed figure from the view of strangers, particularly strangers of the opposite\nsex is impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity,” but ultimately\nconcluding that the defendants had established a legitimate penological reason for\ninvolving female officers in strip searches of male inmates).\n\n        Dunagan’s position is that inmates have no right to be free from same-sex strip\nsearches. But that is not the right that Stoudemire is seeking to vindicate. Rather,\nStoudemire has “identified a well established right, the right not to be subjected to a\nhumiliating strip search in full view of several (or perhaps many) others unless the\nprocedure is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.” Farmer v. Perrill,\n288 F.3d 1254, 1260 (10th Cir. 2002).4 Thus, Dunagan’s emphasis on the fact that this\nwas not a cross-gender strip search is unavailing.\n\n        In evaluating whether a constitutional violation was clearly established, “[t]he\nkey determination is whether a defendant moving for summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity grounds was on notice that his alleged actions were unconstitutional.”\nGrawey, 567 F.3d at 313. Based on the state of the law in existence at the time of the\nstrip search, it was clearly established that suspicionless strip searches were permissible\nas a matter of constitutional law, but only so long as they were reasonable under the\ncircumstances and performed pursuant to a legitimate penological justification. Thus,\nthe district court did not err in holding that, viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Stoudemire, a reasonable officer would have been on notice that the search\nwas unreasonable under the circumstances and devoid of any legitimate penological\njustification related to security and order. Stoudemire, 2011 WL 1303418, at *9. We\ntherefore affirm the denial of summary judgment for Dunagan on the ground of qualified\nimmunity.\n\n\n        4\n          We may look to the decisions of other circuits in determining whether a right is “clearly\nestablished” for qualified immunity purposes. Dickerson, 101 F.3d at 1158.\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                    Page 20\n\n\n                    D. Governmental Immunity Under State Law\n\n        Finally, both Davis and Dunagan assert that they are entitled to governmental\nimmunity under state law on Stoudemire’s claims against them under Mich. Comp. Laws\n§ 330.1722(1), which provides that “[a] recipient of mental health services shall not be\nsubjected to abuse or neglect.” Stoudemire’s claims against Davis and Dunagan under\nthis statute are based on the same facts underlying her § 1983 claims against these\nDefendants. However, Michigan’s governmental immunity law differs from federal\nqualified immunity doctrine. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 691.1407 (negligence); Odom\nv. Wayne Cnty., 760 N.W.2d 217, 228 (Mich. 2008) (intentional torts). The district court\ndid not discuss Stoudemire’s state law claims and made no mention of Davis and\nDunagan’s state law defenses.\n\n        The considerations that “‘classically support[] the law’s ordinary remand\nrequirement’” apply in this case. Brown v. Crowley, 312 F.3d 782, 788 (6th Cir. 2002)\n(quoting INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 17 (2002)); see also Norton v. Town of Islip,\n378 F. App’x 85, 89 (2d Cir. 2010) (remanding matter to district court where court failed\nto rule on defendants’ immunity defenses to state-law-claims). Absent “exceptional\ncircumstances,” we normally decline to rule on an issue not decided below. St. Marys\nFoundry, Inc. v. Emp’rs Ins. of Wausau, 332 F.3d 989, 996 (6th Cir. 2003). No such\ncircumstances are present in this case, and we therefore remand to “ensure that any\nfuture appeal in this case will have the benefit of the district court’s analysis of the issues\nrelating to” the Defendants’ governmental immunity defenses. Brown, 312 F.3d at 788.\n\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court’s decision denying\nqualified immunity with respect to Stoudemire’s § 1983 conditions of confinement claim\nagainst Davis and REMAND such claim to the district court for reconsideration in light\nof this opinion. We AFFIRM the district court’s decision denying qualified immunity\nwith respect to Stoudemire’s § 1983 strip search claim against Dunagan, and REMAND\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich.

Plaintiff-Appellee Martinique\nStoudemire (“Plaintiff” or “Stoudemire”), a double amputee and former prisoner at\nHuron Valley Women’s Correctional Facility (“Huron”) in Ypsilanti, Michigan, brought\nthe instant case against the Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) and\nMDOC-associated officers, doctors, and nurses, asserting violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132; and Mich. Comp.\nLaws § 330.1722. Stoudemire, who has suffered from autoimmune and kidney disorders\nsince she was a youth, alleges that, while she was an inmate at Huron, she underwent\nthree separate amputations as a result of inadequate health care by the Defendants, was\nplaced in a segregation unit immediately following her final amputation that lacked\naccommodations for disabled persons, and was subjected to a strip search that served no\nlegitimate penological purpose. Defendant-Appellants Susan Davis (“Davis”), the\nwarden who allegedly sanctioned Stoudemire’s placement in segregation, and Ariel N.\nDunagan (“Dunagan”), the corrections officer who conducted the strip search, appeal\nfrom the order of the district court denying them summary judgment on their qualified\nimmunity defenses to Stoudemire’s § 1983 claims against them.1 Stoudemire v. Mich.\nDep’t of Corr., No. 07-15387, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1303418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2011). The\ndistrict court did not resolve Stoudemire’s state law claims; Davis and Dunagan reassert\ntheir governmental immunity defense to those claims. For the following reasons, we\nVACATE the denial of qualified immunity as to Davis, AFFIRM the denial of qualified\nimmunity as to Dunagan, and REMAND with instructions for the district court to\naddress Davis’s qualified immunity defense and Davis’s and Dunagan’s state law\ndefenses in a manner not inconsistent with this Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n          The other Defendants who were initially named as appellants moved to be dismissed from this\nappeal and were dismissed by order of this court on December 4, 2012.\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                    Page 3\n\n\n               I. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Pursuant to the “collateral order” doctrine, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291 to review the district court’s interlocutory denial of qualified immunity only to\nthe extent that it turns on an issue of law. Mitchell v. Forsyth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529-30\n(1985). The district court’s characterization of the basis for its ruling is not dispositive.\nSee Livermore ex rel. Rohm v. Lubelan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796758\"><a href=\"/opinion/796758/geraldine-livermore-personal-representative-for-the-estate-of-roland-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402-03 (6th Cir. 2007). Thus, our\njurisdiction is not necessarily defeated by the fact that the district court denied a\ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that there is a genuine issue\nof material fact. Id. at 402. In such a case, we may nevertheless exercise appellate\njurisdiction over purely legal questions related to qualified immunity. Dickerson v.\nMcClellan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730865\"><a href=\"/opinion/730865/chad-timothy-dickerson-and-deon-denay-dickerson-a-minor-by-her-mother-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (6th Cir. 1996). This is so even where the defendant\nimpermissibly relies on disputed facts on appeal; “this court can ignore the defendant’s\nattempts to dispute the facts and nonetheless resolve the legal issue [raised], obviating\nthe need to dismiss the entire appeal for lack of jurisdiction.” Estate of Carter v. City\nof Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790266\"><a href=\"/opinion/790266/estate-of-tori-carter-brenda-chambers-v-city-of-detroit-donald-hollins/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (6th Cir. 2005); see also Thompson v.

However, “[m]ere conclusory statements that the officers\nconstrue the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff cannot confer jurisdiction\nupon this Court.” Thompson, 656 F.3d at 368.\n\n        We review de novo a district court’s denial of a defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds. See Tucker v. City of Richmond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (6th Cir. 2004). We also review de novo the question of whether a defendant\nis entitled to governmental immunity under Michigan law. Reilly v. Vadlamudi,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801004\"><a href=\"/opinion/801004/reilly-v-vadlamudi/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Herman v.

R. Civ. P. 56(a).      We determine materiality by reference to the applicable\n\fNo. 11-1588         Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.

Summary judgment is not\nappropriate “if the dispute about a material fact is ‘genuine,’ that is, if the evidence is\nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id.; see also\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In reviewing a summary judgment motion, we view all facts and\ndraw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\nSee Scott v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (2007). In the qualified immunity context, “this\nusually means adopting . . . the plaintiff’s version of the facts,” id., unless the plaintiff’s\nversion is “blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe\nit . . . .” Id. at 380.\n\n                             II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n                            A. Stoudemire’s Medical History\n\n         When twenty-three-year-old Martinique Stoudemire entered the MDOC system\nin July 2002, she came with a long and well-documented history of health problems.\nStoudemire suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic and painful\nautoimmune disease; hypercoagulapathy, a related disorder characterized by a tendency\nto develop blood clots; and depression. Without proper care, Stoudemire bore a\nsignificant risk of experiencing kidney and liver damage, heart attacks, amputations, and\nchronic pain.\n\n         Stoudemire’s health quickly deteriorated. During her five years at Huron, she\nexperienced a heart attack, liver failure, and a number of life-threatening embolisms.\nShe underwent three amputations, eventually losing both legs below the knee. By the\ntime of her parole in August of 2007, she also suffered from chronic depression, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and a number of conditions related to medications she had\nreceived during her incarceration. Stoudemire attributes her health complications to the\nalleged failure of MDOC staff members and associated doctors and nurses to provide her\nwith adequate health care while she was incarcerated. For the purposes of this appeal,\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 5\n\n\nhowever, we focus on the events following Stoudemire’s final amputation in December\n2006, when her stump and buttock became infected with Methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus Aureas (“MRSA”) and she was quarantined in Huron’s segregation unit.\n\n              B. Stoudemire’s Placement in Huron’s Segregation Unit\n\n         According to an April 14, 2005, Memorandum from Richard D. Russell,\nAdministrator of the MDOC Health Care Bureau, “all prisoners with a documented\nculture positive for MRSA must be quarantined.” The policy provides that responsible\nstaff members must notify the warden of the particular facility of a confirmed MRSA\ncase in order to initiate the quarantine process. If health care staff determine that\nmedical quarantine is necessary, the warden is responsible for isolating the infected\ninmates. The warden has the discretion to choose a quarantine location within the prison\nand may also opt to send infected inmates to another site. Davis designated Huron’s\nsegregation unit, which prisoners and guards call “the hole,” as a quarantine location.\nThe segregation unit is normally used for isolating prisoners who have violated prison\nrules.\n\n         Stoudemire spent roughly two weeks in quarantine as a consequence of her\nMRSA infection. At her deposition, Davis testified that she “was probably aware at the\ntime” that Stoudemire had been placed in segregation for medical purposes but that she\n“[didn’t] recall specifically.”\n\n         Stoudemire alleges that she received extremely poor medical care while in\nsegregation. The segregation cells were not equipped to accommodate disabled patients.\nStoudemire was never provided with any assistive devices that might have allowed her\nto safely move between her bed, wheelchair, toilet, and shower. There was no call\nbutton, so Stoudemire had to shout when she needed assistance. She alleges that the\nmedical staff treated her with contempt. They accused her of malingering and responded\nwith hostility whenever she sought assistance. As a result, Stoudemire was left to care\nfor herself. She was forced to crawl from her bed to the toilet. On one occasion, she had\nto urinate into a bowl. On another occasion, she defecated on herself. The staff\nneglected Stoudemire’s hygiene. She received only one shower during her two weeks\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 6\n\n\nin segregation and was required to dress her wounds herself, which put her at risk of\ninfection.\n\n       According to one of Plaintiff’s experts, Stoudemire received “very little medical\nrounding” while she was in the segregation unit, which was “a terrible place to put an\namputee.” Davis testified that, in cases where a physically handicapped prisoner was\nplaced in a segregation cell, she “would check the logbook to make sure that medical\nprofessionals had been through at least daily to see the prisoner for however often the\nprisoner’s particular need was.” Davis also testified that she would “check to make sure\nthat my deputy warden or [an assistant deputy warden] had been through . . . [and]\npersonally observed that prisoner to make sure that, you know, they weren’t hanging\nthemselves in the cell or what have you.”\n\n                     C. The Strip Search by Officer Dunagan\n\n       Stoudemire also challenges the constitutionality of a February 10, 2007, strip\nsearch performed by Officer Dunagan. Stoudemire’s account is as follows: Stoudemire\nwas in the infirmary’s common area, waiting to be escorted to an aerobics class.\nDunagan approached and announced her intention to conduct a strip search. When\nStoudemire asked Dunagan for a reason for the search, Dunagan said, “[b]ecause I can.”\nDunagan took Stoudemire to Stoudemire’s cell. Dunagan did not cover the window on\nthe cell door, which looked out onto a busy hallway. Dunagan and Stoudemire were\npositioned so that passers-by had an unobstructed view of Stoudemire. Dunagan\n“displayed pleasure at [Stoudemire’s] discomfort,” smirking throughout the search.\nStoudemire stripped down to her underpants and removed her prosthetic legs. She could\nhear people in the hallway and realized that they could see her. She felt humiliated.\nDunagan did not find any contraband.\n\n       Dunagan offers a markedly different account of the search. According to\nDunagan, she asked Stoudemire to submit to a pat-down search rather than a strip search.\nStoudemire “refused and sped off in her wheelchair to her room, saying that she had to\nchange her shirt before I [did] my pat-down search.” Dunagan followed Stoudemire to\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                   Page 7\n\n\nher cell and decided to conduct a strip search because Stoudemire had tried to evade the\npat-down search. Dunagan did not cover the cell-door window, but she did position\nherself between the window and Stoudemire, thereby blocking passers-by from seeing\nStoudemire. Stoudemire stripped down to her brassiere and underpants. Dunagan\ndiscovered a cigarette and matches–contraband items–in Stoudemire’s hand. She issued\nStoudemire a misconduct ticket.\n\n       Some facts are not in dispute. The day after the search, Stoudemire filed a\ngrievance, alleging that Dunagan’s conduct constituted sexual harassment.             The\ngrievance was denied, but Dunagan received an official reprimand for conducting the\nsearch in violation of MDOC Policy Directive 4.04.110 ¶ U, which states that “[a] strip\nsearch shall be conducted in a place which prevents the search from being observed by\nthose not assisting in that search . . . .” The reprimand notes that other persons could\nhave observed Stoudemire during the search because Dunagan did not block the window\non the door, and that Dunagan admitted that such “visual contact” was possible. In\naddition, MDOC Policy Directive 4.07.112 ¶ GG requires that, when an officer finds\ncontraband, the contraband must be confiscated and a contraband removal record must\nbe issued to the prisoner, as well as either a misconduct report or a notice of intent to\nconduct an administrative hearing.

On appeal, Davis argues that the district court erred in denying\nher qualified immunity on Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement\nclaim under § 1983 because Stoudemire did not show that Davis was deliberately\nindifferent to Stoudemire’s medical needs.\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v.

The court also found that “the MDOC\nDefendants neglected to make any reasonable adjustments for her as a brand-new double\namputee who could not ambulate within her segregated cell without the assistance of\nanother person.” Id. The court then concluded that Stoudemire had “sufficiently alleged\nthe violation of a clearly established right.” Id. As a result of a series of stipulations\nand Stoudemire’s decision not to challenge a portion of the Defendant’s motion to\ndismiss, Stoudemire had effectively withdrawn her Eighth Amendment claim (arising\nfrom her quarantine) against all but Davis; in a footnote, the district court noted that “the\nanalysis by the court applies only to Davis.” Id. at *8 n.7. Nonetheless, the district court\ndenied qualified immunity for the “Defendants.” The court also denied Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on Stoudemire’s ADA claim.\n\n            1. Issues Regarding Whether Claim Properly Before the Court\n\n        Davis and Stoudemire both argue that we cannot consider the merits of\nStoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim. According to Davis, Stoudemire never actually\npleaded such a claim; instead, the district court improperly “created” an Eighth\nAmendment claim by relying on the facts Stoudemire alleged solely in support of her\nADA claim. Stoudemire argues that Davis failed to raise qualified immunity as a\ndefense to Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim and that the court therefore lacks\njurisdiction over Davis’s appeal. See Mingus v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1463927\"><a href=\"/opinion/1463927/mingus-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483-84 (6th Cir.\n2010) (declining to address defendant’s assertion of qualified immunity where the\ndefense was not initially presented to the court).

The district court\ncorrectly stated that Stoudemire’s Eighth Amendment claim was based on “the same\nmisconduct which gives rise to her claims under the ADA.” Stoudemire, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1303418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. The court found that “the claimed misconduct . . . if true, supports\nindependent causes of action under Title II [of the ADA] and the Eighth Amendment.”\nId. at *6. Clearly, the district court was not “confuse[d],” and did not conflate the ADA\nclaim with the Eighth Amendment claim, as Davis argues. Rather, the district court\nproperly construed Stoudemire’s Complaint “so as to do justice.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e);\nsee also Minger v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772013\"><a href=\"/opinion/772013/gail-minger-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-michael-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799 (“[T]he Rules require that we not rely\nsolely on labels in a complaint, but that we probe deeper and examine the substance of\nthe complaint.”).\n\n       We also reject Stoudemire’s contention that Davis did not raise qualified\nimmunity as a defense. Stoudemire’s argument rests entirely on the following sentence\nin Defendants’ motion before the district court: “Had the plaintiff alleged this as a\nconstitutional violation, the defendants would respond that they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity because clearly established law does not prohibit quarantining a prisoner to\nprotect the prison population from infection.” The sentence must be read in the context\nof the paragraph, which begins: “As to the remainder of the claims, the defendants are\nalso entitled to qualified immunity and summary judgment.” Taken together, these\nsentences clearly suffice as an assertion of qualified immunity.

Though\nthe district court stated in a footnote that its ruling only applied to Davis, since the\nPlaintiff by stipulation or otherwise had conceded its claims against the other defendants,\nas stated above, it denied qualified immunity for “Defendants.” In so doing, the court\ndid not conduct a particularized analysis of whether Davis was deliberately indifferent\nto the conditions of Stoudemire’s confinement while in quarantine. The district court\ndid not mention any facts in the record that specifically pertained to Davis, nor did the\ncourt make any findings regarding Davis’s knowledge or mental state.

Dunagan’s Appeal\n\n       Dunagan appeals the district court’s denial of qualified immunity in regard to\nStoudemire’s § 1983 claim relating to the 2007 strip search. In contrast to its resolution\nof Davis’s qualified immunity defense, the district court addressed Dunagan’s defense\nwith sufficient particularity to enable our review. Viewing the record in the light most\nfavorable to Stoudemire, the district court held that “Dunagan should have been on\nnotice that [the strip search] would have been unreasonable under the circumstances and\nnot based on a reasonable penological interest of security and order.” Stoudemire,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1303418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. On appeal, Dunagan argues that Stoudemire has failed to\n“show that there is clearly established law prohibiting the conduct in question,”\nemphasizing that Stoudemire has presented no case holding that a same-sex strip search\nof a prisoner was unlawful. Stoudemire’s alleged injury, however, is not tied to\nDunagan’s gender. Rather, Stoudemire’s focus is on evidence that suggests that the\nsearch was “undertaken to harass or humiliate” and not for any legitimate purpose.\nAccording to Stoudemire, the relevant constitutional question is not whether clearly\nestablished law proscribes same-sex strip searches in prisons, but whether clearly\nestablished law proscribes a strip search that served no legitimate penological purpose\nand was intended only to harass. Dunagan focuses on whether the law regarding same-\nsex strip searches is “clearly established” for qualified immunity purposes. However,\n\fNo. 11-1588         Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                             Page 14\n\n\nthe applicable inquiry is whether the strip search was reasonable under the circumstances\nand whether Stoudemire’s constitutional rights in this regard were clearly established at\nthe time of the search.

In Hudson, the Court “addressed the question of whether prison officials could perform random\nsearches of inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect a particular individual of concealing\na prohibited item.” Florence, 132 S.

The Court held that “society is not\nprepared to recognize as legitimate any subjective expectation of privacy that a prisoner might have in his\nprison cell.” Hudson, 468 U.S. at 526 (emphasis added). Hudson stands for the proposition that “prisoners\nhave no reasonable expectation of privacy protecting their cells from unreasonable searches.” Kent v.\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490161\"><a href=\"/opinion/490161/lawrence-h-kent-v-perry-johnson-and-dale-foltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1226 (6th Cir. 1987) (emphasis added).

Page 15\n\n\nSupreme Court instructs us that, where a prisoner alleges a constitutionally unreasonable\nsearch,\n\n          [t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment . . . requires a\n          balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\n          personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\n          the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\n          justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\n\nBell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559 (1979). Accordingly, we first examine the scope,\nmanner, and location of the search–as well as the justification for initiating it–in order\nto assess the degree to which it invaded the prisoner’s right to privacy. We next evaluate\nthe need for the search, giving due deference to the correctional officer’s exercise of her\ndiscretionary functions. Finally, we determine whether the search was reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests by weighing the need against the invasion.\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1516. Because Stoudemire’s account of the search has not been\n“blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it,” Scott,\n550 U.S. at 380, the procedural posture of this appeal requires us to accept Stoudemire’s\nversion of the events.\n\n                         (a) Degree of Invasion of Personal Rights\n\n          The scope of the search frames our analysis of the other Bell factors. Had\nDunagan conducted a pat-down search or a search of Stoudemire’s room, it is doubtful\nthat her actions would rise to the level of a constitutional violation. However, “a strip\nsearch, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well\nas an offense to the dignity of the individual.” Wood v. Clemons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196882\"><a href=\"/opinion/196882/wood-v-mcc-superintendant/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 928 (1st\nCir. 1996). It is a practice that “instinctively gives us . . . pause,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 558,\nsince “[u]ndergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliating and deeply offensive\nto many . . . .” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1524 (Alito, J., concurring). To the extent that\nprisoners have some right, however diminished, “to be secure in their persons . . . against\nunreasonable searches,” U.S. Const. amend IV, a strip search is a particularly extreme\ninvasion of that right. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-60. The facts of Dunagan’s strip search of\nStoudemire tell us as much.\n\fNo. 11-1588         Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                          Page 16\n\n\n         The location of the strip search made it more invasive. Because Dunagan did not\nblock the window of the cell, the search did not take place in a private location; as\nDunagan admitted, people in the hall could see Stoudemire naked, her prosthetic legs\nremoved. Cf. Dufrin v. Spreen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421867\"><a href=\"/opinion/421867/caroline-dufrin-v-oakland-county-sheriff-johannes-spreen/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089 (6th Cir. 1983) (finding strip search\nthat “was carried out discreetly and in privacy” to be unobtrusive). Dunagan received\na reprimand for her failure to conduct the strip search “in a place which prevent[ed] the\nsearch from being observed by those not assisting in that search,” in violation of the\nMDOC’s rules. The MDOC rule and Dunagan’s reprimand underscore the obvious: a\nstrip search is more invasive when it is performed where other people can see the person\nbeing stripped.3 See, e.g., Amaechi v. West, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771726\"><a href=\"/opinion/771726/lisa-amaechi-v-matthew-west-and-bernard-r-pfluger-town-of-dumfries/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (4th Cir. 2001); Iskander\nv.

Stoudemire\nhighlights two facts in this regard: that Dunagan refused to tell Stoudemire her reasons\nfor initiating the search and that Dunagan smirked during the search. Although these\nfacts are hardly dispositive, see Roden v. Sowders, 84 F. App’x 611, 613 (6th Cir. 2003)\n(“Even if [the defendant prison guard] did laugh, the strip search is not rendered\nconstitutionally invalid thereby.”), they may, in context, suggest personal animus and\nimplicate the dignitary interest “inherent in the privacy component of the Fourth\nAmendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches.” Brannum v. Overton Cnty.\nSch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262302\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262302/brannum-v-overton-county-school-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n                            (b) The Degree of Need for the Search\n\n         Our next step is to evaluate the need for the particular search. Bell, 441 U.S. at\n559. Unquestionably, “detect[ing] and deter[ing] the possession of contraband” is a\nlegitimate penological objective. Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1517. Absent proof to the\ncontrary, we must assume that a search of a prisoner is initiated in an effort to detect and\ndeter contraband. See Hudson, 468 U.S. at 529 (quoting Marrero v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1302147\"><a href=\"/opinion/1302147/marrero-v-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (Va. 1981)) (“For one to advocate that prison searches must be\n\n         3\n          We note that prisoners enjoy no special privacy rights in their cells. See Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n526; United States v.

Our focus, however, is not on the type\nof room but on the degree of privacy the location actually provided during the search.\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                  Page 17\n\n\nconducted only . . . when suspicion is directed at a particular inmate is to ignore the\nrealities of prison operation.”). But to say that Dunagan had a legitimate justification for\nsearching, or even strip searching, Stoudemire does not conclude our inquiry. We must\nfurther determine “the need for the particular search” at issue. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559\n(emphasis added).\n\n        The question, then, is whether any exigent circumstances compelled Dunagan\nto strip search Stoudemire in view of other inmates and prison personnel. The record\nsuggests no such exigencies. As Dunagan’s reprimand shows, no emergency made such\na search necessary. Cf., Cookish v. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569090\"><a href=\"/opinion/569090/dennis-r-cookish-v-commissioner-ronald-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448-49 (1st Cir. 1991)\n(holding that visual body cavity searches, some of which were conducted in view of\nguards of the opposite sex, did not violate clearly established rights where searches were\nconducted in response to what plaintiff conceded was a “riot” situation). There is no\nevidence that Dunagan chose the search location out of concern for Dunagan’s own\nsafety. Cf. Michenfelder v. Sumner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513325\"><a href=\"/opinion/513325/robert-michenfelder-v-george-sumner-lieutenant-koon-co-horn-co-leslie/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding\nlegitimate penological justification for conducting searches in public hallways where\nonly alternative in the prison unit would have presented a risk to officer safety).\nStoudemire did not have “a history of maladaptive behavior within prison” that might\nweigh in favor of conducting the search. Id. at 332 (collecting cases). Also, there were\nno time or resource constraints that supported the need for such an ad hoc search.\nAccordingly, although Dunagan had a valid reason for searching Stoudemire, no special\ncircumstances provided additional justifications for strip searching Stoudemire where\nothers could see her naked.\n\n        On balance, although the “test of reasonableness . . . is not capable of precise\ndefinition,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, particularly as applied to prisoners, we conclude that,\ntaking the facts as Stoudemire alleged them, she has established a constitutional\nviolation. In so deciding, we do not underestimate the importance of deterring and\ndetecting contraband in prisons, nor have we forgotten to afford Dunagan the deference\ndue to a correctional officer executing a difficult discretionary responsibility. But it is\nsettled that the law demands an adequate need for a strip search, and, depending on the\n\fNo. 11-1588      Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                Page 18\n\n\ncircumstances and context, restricts the scope, manner, and place of the search. Id.\nHere, the excessively invasive nature of the search outweighed any need to conduct it\nin such a fashion.\n\n       It is important to emphasize two points. First, it is unquestionable that the\nSupreme Court and lower courts have sanctioned a wide range of practices—many of\nthem intrusive—that are designed to further legitimate penological interests. See, e.g.,\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1518-20 (discussing significant interests for conducting strip\nsearches as part of inmate booking process); Hudson, 468 U.S. at 529 (stating that\n“wholly random searches [of prison cells] are essential to the effective security of penal\ninstitutions”); Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 (holding that routine visual body cavity searches\nafter contact visits do not violate the Fourth Amendment). Second, it is important to\nnote that the MDOC’s policies are not under review. Had Dunagan followed procedure,\nshe would not have violated Stoudemire’s Fourth Amendment rights.                We are\nconsidering the acts of a single corrections officer sued in her individual capacity.\nNormally, separation of powers and federalism concerns weigh heavily in our review of\nprison regulations. Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85. But we are not dealing with a policy or\nwide-ranging regulation, as indicated in the cases cited above. Instead, the “[f]actual\nnuances” of this case determine whether Dunagan violated Stoudemire’s personal rights.\nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523 (Roberts, C.J., concurring); see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 560.\nOur holding is confined to the facts, viewed most favorably to the inmate, of the\nparticular search under review.\n\n              2. Whether Dunagan Violated a “Clearly Established” Right\n\n       As noted above, Dunagan’s arguments on appeal focus primarily on the question\nof whether Stoudemire has satisfied the “clearly established” prong of the qualified\nimmunity analysis in view of the fact that she does not cite any cases involving same-sex\nstrip searches. While it is true that this court has stated that an expectation of privacy\nmay, in the prison context, be particularly reasonable “where those claims are related to\nforced exposure to strangers of the opposite sex,” Cornwell, 963 F.2d at 916, Dunagan\nis mistaken in suggesting that the gender of the parties involved is wholly dispositive of\n\fNo. 11-1588        Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                       Page 19\n\n\nthe constitutional question. The gender of the parties is just one fact for the court to\nconsider in determining the reasonableness of a given search or the legitimacy of a\nchallenged practice. See, e.g., Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333-34 (noting that “[s]hielding\none’s unclothed figure from the view of strangers, particularly strangers of the opposite\nsex is impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity,” but ultimately\nconcluding that the defendants had established a legitimate penological reason for\ninvolving female officers in strip searches of male inmates).\n\n        Dunagan’s position is that inmates have no right to be free from same-sex strip\nsearches. But that is not the right that Stoudemire is seeking to vindicate. Rather,\nStoudemire has “identified a well established right, the right not to be subjected to a\nhumiliating strip search in full view of several (or perhaps many) others unless the\nprocedure is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.” Farmer v. Perrill,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162211\"><a href=\"/opinion/162211/farmer-v-perrill/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1260 (10th Cir. 2002).4 Thus, Dunagan’s emphasis on the fact that this\nwas not a cross-gender strip search is unavailing.\n\n        In evaluating whether a constitutional violation was clearly established, “[t]he\nkey determination is whether a defendant moving for summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity grounds was on notice that his alleged actions were unconstitutional.”\nGrawey, 567 F.3d at 313. Based on the state of the law in existence at the time of the\nstrip search, it was clearly established that suspicionless strip searches were permissible\nas a matter of constitutional law, but only so long as they were reasonable under the\ncircumstances and performed pursuant to a legitimate penological justification. Thus,\nthe district court did not err in holding that, viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Stoudemire, a reasonable officer would have been on notice that the search\nwas unreasonable under the circumstances and devoid of any legitimate penological\njustification related to security and order. Stoudemire, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1303418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. We\ntherefore affirm the denial of summary judgment for Dunagan on the ground of qualified\nimmunity.\n\n\n        4\n          We may look to the decisions of other circuits in determining whether a right is “clearly\nestablished” for qualified immunity purposes. Dickerson, 101 F.3d at 1158.\n\fNo. 11-1588       Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corrections, et al.                    Page 20\n\n\n                    D. Governmental Immunity Under State Law\n\n        Finally, both Davis and Dunagan assert that they are entitled to governmental\nimmunity under state law on Stoudemire’s claims against them under Mich. Comp. Laws\n§ 330.1722(1), which provides that “[a] recipient of mental health services shall not be\nsubjected to abuse or neglect.” Stoudemire’s claims against Davis and Dunagan under\nthis statute are based on the same facts underlying her § 1983 claims against these\nDefendants. However, Michigan’s governmental immunity law differs from federal\nqualified immunity doctrine. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 691.1407 (negligence); Odom\nv.

The district court\ndid not discuss Stoudemire’s state law claims and made no mention of Davis and\nDunagan’s state law defenses.\n\n        The considerations that “‘classically support[] the law’s ordinary remand\nrequirement’” apply in this case.
