A 127-count Second Superseding\n\nIndictment (the “Indictment”) charged sixteen defendants (eleven individuals and\n\nfive corporate firms) with conspiracy to commit bribery, substantive offenses of\n\nbribery, honest services mail fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice. Nine\n\ndefendants appeal their convictions here. Three of those nine defendants appeal\n\ntheir sentences.\n\n      Specifically, the nine defendant-appellants are: two former County officials,\n\nthree corporate contractors, and four individuals who owned these respective\n\ncontractors. The two defendant County officials were in charge of the sewer\n\nprogram and received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes from the\n\ndefendant contractors. In many cases, the contractors disguised these payments by\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\faltering invoices or hiding costs within their accounting systems. In turn, the\n\ndefendant contractors obtained hundreds of millions of dollars worth of payments\n\non construction and engineering contracts with the County. The County officials\n\napproved the contractors’ pay requests, change orders, time extensions, and/or\n\nrequests for field directives, all of which financially benefitted the defendant\n\ncontractors.\n\n       After review and oral argument, we conclude the evidence at the trials\n\noverwhelmingly established the defendant-appellants’ guilt, and they have shown\n\nno reversible error in the district courts’ rulings, pre-trial or in the trials, in the\n\ncases consolidated on appeal. Thus, we affirm all of the defendant-appellants’\n\nconvictions except Roland Pugh Construction, Inc.’s conviction on Count 75,\n\nwhich is barred by the statute of limitations. We also affirm Jewell C. “Chris”\n\nMcNair’s sentence in full. We affirm Jack W. Swann’s sentence in part but\n\nremand for further proceedings as to the amount of the fine. As to the sentence of\n\nRoland Pugh Construction, Inc., we (1) affirm the district court’s findings of fact\n\nas supported by the record; and (2) conclude there was no error in the district\n\ncourt’s calculations under the sentencing guidelines; but (3) in light of the reversal\n\nof its Count 75 conviction, we vacate its sentence and remand for resentencing\n\nwithout Count 75.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Jefferson County Officials\n\n       The defendant County officials implicated in the bribery scandal are:\n\n       Defendant McNair: Jewell C. “Chris” McNair (“McNair”) was a Jefferson\n\nCounty Commissioner. McNair was responsible for overseeing the operation of\n\nthe Jefferson County Environmental Services Division (“JCESD”), which included\n\nthe sewer system.1\n\n       Defendant Swann: Jack W. Swann (“Swann”) was the Director of the\n\nJCESD.\n\n       Defendant Wilson: Ronald K. Wilson (“Wilson”) was Chief Civil Engineer\n\nfor the JCESD and served on the Product Review Committee (“PRC”).2 After\n\nleaving the JCESD in 1999, Wilson formed his own firm, Civil Engineering\n\nDesign Services, Inc. (“CEDS”).\n\n\n       1\n          The repair and rehabilitation project, which is the subject of this appeal, was required\nunder the terms of a consent decree between Jefferson County and the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency. The consent decree was entered into as a settlement of claims brought by the\nU.S. Justice Department in 1994 against Jefferson County for violations of the Clean Water Act,\nand it required Jefferson County to repair and upgrade dilapidated sewer lines and wastewater\ntreatment plants that were overflowing and leaking sewage into local watersheds. The JCESD\ninitially estimated the work would cost County ratepayers $1.2 to 1.5 billion over the next\ndecade. The actual costs were closer to $3 billion.\n       2\n         The PRC was a technical committee that reviewed materials, specified the products that\ncould be used on the sewer project, and qualified contractors for certain kinds of work on the\nproject. During the relevant time period, the PRC had between 10 and 11 members. Among\nthem were defendants Wilson and Barber, and co-conspirators Harry Chandler, Donald Ellis, and\nLarry Creel.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Defendant Barber: Clarence R. Barber (“Barber”) was Chief Construction\n\nMaintenance Supervisor for the JCESD and served on the PRC.\n\nB.     Contractors\n\n       These defendant corporate firms and individuals had either construction or\n\nengineering contracts with the JCESD and were implicated in the bribery scandal.\n\n       Pugh defendants: Roland Pugh Construction, Inc. (“PUGH”); Grady Roland\n\nPugh, Sr. (“Roland Pugh”), founder, board chairman, and 70% owner of PUGH;\n\nand Joseph E. “Eddie” Yessick (“Yessick”), President and 10% owner of PUGH.\n\nPUGH had $178 million in sewer construction contracts with Jefferson County\n\nbetween August 1999 and January 2002. PUGH was a “dig-and-replace”\n\ncontractor.3\n\n       Rast defendants: Rast Construction, Inc. (“RAST”); Bobby J. Rast (“Bobby\n\nRast”), President and co-owner of RAST; and his brother Daniel B. Rast (“Danny\n\nRast”), Vice President and co-owner of RAST. RAST had about $100 million in\n\nsewer construction contracts with Jefferson County during the same period. RAST\n\nwas another “dig-and-replace” contractor.\n\n       3\n        A “dig-and-replace” contractor traditionally digs up broken sewer pipes, replaces them,\nand paves over the repair. Some dig-and-replace contractors have the capacity to perform\n“cured-in-place” work. The “cured-in-place” process involves the relining of cracked pipes with\na cement product that cures inside the pipes and seals the cracks from within. None of the\ndefendants here performed cured-in-place work. However, PUGH and Defendant Rast\nConstruction, Inc. entered into joint ventures with contractors who could perform cured-in-place\nwork, as discussed later.\n\n                                               5\n\f      Dougherty defendants: F. W. Dougherty Engineering & Associates, Inc.\n\n(“FWDE”) and Floyd W. “Pat” Dougherty (“Dougherty”), President and owner.\n\nFWDE received $11.4 million in no-bid engineering contracts with Jefferson\n\nCounty during the same period.\n\n      USI defendants: US Infrastructure, Inc. (“USI”); Sohan Singh (“Singh”),\n\nPresident of USI; and Edward Key (“Key”), Vice President of USI. USI received\n\nabout $50 million in engineering contracts with Jefferson County between 1999\n\nand 2003.\n\nC.    Co-conspirators\n\n      Five other individual co-conspirators pled guilty and testified for the\n\ngovernment in one or more of the five trials:\n\n      Grady Pugh: Grady Roland Pugh, Jr. (“Grady Pugh”) was CEO and 10%\n\nowner of PUGH. He is the defendant Roland Pugh’s son.\n\n      Chandler: Harry T. Chandler (“Chandler”) was Assistant Director of the\n\nJCESD and served on the PRC.\n\n      Ellis: Donald R. Ellis (“Ellis”) was an engineer for the JCESD and Chairman\n\nof the PRC.\n\n      Creel: Larry P. Creel (“Creel”) was a Maintenance Supervisor for the\n\nJCESD and served on the PRC.\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f       Dawson: William H. Dawson (“Dawson”) was the owner of Dawson\n\nEngineering, Inc. (“Dawson Engineering”), which received at least $20 million\n\nworth of no-bid engineering contracts from Jefferson County.\n\n       While the Indictment alleges certain conduct by these five individuals as co-\n\nconspirators, they are not named defendants in the Indictment at issue in this\n\nappeal.\n\nD.     The Indictment\n\n       The Indictment contained 127 counts.4 Six of the counts charged a bribery\n\nconspiracy. Specifically, Counts 1 (against McNair and the Pugh, Rast, and\n\nDougherty defendants), 32 (against McNair and the USI defendants), 50 (against\n\nMcNair and the USI defendants), 51 (against Swann and the Pugh, Rast, and\n\nDougherty defendants, except for Roland Pugh), 75 (against Wilson and PUGH),\n\nand 78 (against Barber and the Pugh defendants) charged conspiracy to commit\n\nbribery under 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 666.\n\n       Counts 2-31, 33-49, 52-74, 76-77, and 79-89 charged one or more\n\ndefendants with substantive bribery offenses (or aiding and abetting bribery) under\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        The original indictment was filed on February 7, 2005, and the Superseding Indictment\nwas filed on July 13, 2005. After the five co-conspirators listed above pled guilty over a period\nof several months, the government submitted the Second Superseding Indictment on August 26,\n2005, dropping the defendants who had pled guilty. The counts referenced in this opinion are as\nnumbered in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n\n                                                7\n\f18 U.S.C. § 666. For the most part, these substantive bribery offenses were the\n\novert acts charged in the conspiracy counts.\n\n       Counts 90-101 charged honest services mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341\n\nand 1346 against defendants Swann, Yessick, and PUGH. Counts 102-121\n\ncharged honest services mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1346 against\n\ndefendants Swann, Wilson, CEDS, FWDE, and Dougherty. Counts 122-124\n\ncharged mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 against the Dougherty defendants.\n\nCounts 125-127 charged obstruction of justice against certain defendants under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1503.\n\n       Some of these counts were dismissed before trial, and other counts were\n\ndismissed prior to jury deliberations. And some defendants, such as Roland Pugh,\n\nwere dismissed from some of the counts that went to the jury. This opinion\n\naddresses only the counts that were actually submitted to the jury.\n\nE.     Five Trials\n\n       The 127-count Indictment was severed into five separate cases for trial:\n\nMcNair (05-061), Swann (05-544), Barber (05-542), Wilson (05-545), and USI\n\n(05-543).5 The McNair trial involved bribes by the Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty\n\n\n       5\n       Grady Pugh, Chandler, Ellis, Dawson, and Creel testified for the government in the\nMcNair trial. Chandler, Ellis, and Wilson testified for the government in the Swann trial. Grady\nPugh, Chandler, and Yessick testified for the government in the Barber trial. Grady Pugh and\nChandler testified for the government in the Wilson trial. Chandler, Ellis, and Dawson testified\n\n                                               8\n\fdefendants primarily to McNair but also to Chandler and Ellis. The USI trial\n\ninvolved bribes to McNair by the USI defendants. The other trials involved bribes\n\nto Swann, Barber, and Wilson, respectively.\n\n       In the USI trial, defendants USI, Key, and Singh were convicted of, among\n\nother things, conspiracy to commit bribery and substantive bribery offenses for\n\nmaking payments to defendant Commissioner McNair and the JCESD’s Chandler\n\nand Ellis. This Court affirmed defendants USI, Key, and Singh’s convictions and\n\nsentences in United States v. US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d 1195 (11th Cir. 2009),\n\ncert. denied, __ S. Ct. __, 78 U.S.L.W. 3540 (U.S. Mar. 22, 2010) (No. 09-967).\n\nDefendant McNair entered a conditional guilty plea to Count 32 (conspiracy to\n\naccept a $140,000 bribe from the USI defendants).6 McNair reserved the right to\n\nappeal the district court’s denial of his motion to dismiss Count 32. McNair’s\n\nappeal in the USI case has been consolidated with the present appeal.\n\nF.     Nine Parties to This Appeal\n\n       This present consolidated appeal involves not only defendant McNair’s\n\nappeal in the USI case but also these defendants’ appeals in the other four trials:\n\n       (1) McNair trial: defendants McNair, PUGH, Roland Pugh, RAST, Bobby\n\n\nfor the government in the USI trial.\n       6\n        McNair’s motion to dismiss sought dismissal of Counts 32 and 50 (both counts of\nconspiracy to commit bribery), arguing under “Wharton’s Rule” that a conspiracy cannot exist as\nan offense separate from the substantive offense of bribery (charged in Counts 33-37).\n\n                                               9\n\fRast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty. Defendant Yessick (President of\n\nPUGH) was convicted at trial and does not appeal.\n\n      (2) Swann trial: defendants Swann, PUGH, RAST, Bobby Rast, FWDE, and\n\nDougherty. Defendant Yessick was convicted at trial and does not appeal.\n\n      (3) Barber trial: defendant PUGH. Defendants Barber and Yessick pled\n\nguilty and do not appeal.\n\n      (4) Wilson trial: defendant PUGH. Defendant Wilson was convicted at trial\n\nand does not appeal.\n\n      Albeit from five separate cases, the defendant-appellants raise many of the\n\nsame issues. We discuss (1) the evidence in the McNair, Swann, Barber, and\n\nWilson trials, and (2) the issues commonly raised by the defendants, followed by\n\n(3) certain issues pertaining to particular defendants.\n\n                        II. THE McNAIR TRIAL (05-061)\n\n      The McNair trial, held from April 6 to 21, 2006, involved over $350,000 in\n\nbribes the Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants paid to Commissioner McNair\n\nand $6,600 in bribes they paid to County employees Chandler and Ellis. The\n\ngovernment called 36 witnesses, including Chandler, Ellis, Dawson, Creel, and\n\nGrady Pugh. The defense called 23 witnesses. No named defendant testified.\n\n      The government’s witnesses described in great detail the bribes to McNair,\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fChandler, and Ellis, and how those three County officials financially helped the\n\nPugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants in their contracts with and payments from\n\nJefferson County. Because the defendant contractors in the McNair trial claimed\n\nthey paid McNair only out of a long-time friendship and lacked corrupt intent, the\n\ndistrict court admitted certain evidence, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b),\n\nabout how these same defendants bribed Swann and other County employees in\n\norder to show the defendants’ corrupt intent and common plan. Thus, our\n\nrecitation of evidence in the McNair trial covers bribes given not only to McNair\n\nbut also to Swann and other County employees.\n\nA.       McNair Helps Contractor-Defendants\n\n         Jefferson County was governed by five elected Commissioners, each of\n\nwhom had a different area of responsibility. Defendant McNair held office as a\n\nCounty Commissioner from 1996 until his retirement in March 2001. McNair was\n\nresponsible for overseeing the JCESD, which included the sewer systems. McNair\n\nhad authority to approve pay requests from the sewer construction contractors, to\n\napprove change orders7 increasing the contract price paid to those contractors, to\n\napprove change orders modifying the contract terms in favor of those contractors,\n\nto approve emergency payments to contractors, to select consulting engineers\n\n\n         7\n             Change orders are contract modifications in the Jefferson County Commission’s Agenda\nitems.\n\n                                                  11\n\fthrough a no-bid process, and to approve the engineers’ contracts and payments.\n\nAlthough final approval required the vote of the entire Commission, there was no\n\nevidence that the Commission questioned or disapproved of any pay request or\n\nchange order approved by McNair or any selection or award of a contract\n\nrecommended by McNair. McNair’s nickname among the contractors was “Big\n\nMan.”\n\n        McNair approved payments (in the hundreds of millions of dollars) to the\n\nPugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants (the “contractor-defendants”), approved\n\nchange orders (in the millions of dollars) benefitting PUGH and RAST, and\n\napproved no-bid engineering contracts (in the millions of dollars) to FWDE, all\n\nwhile these defendants were paying for materials and labor to expand and renovate\n\nMcNair’s photography studio. Each item requiring Commission approval, such as\n\ncontract awards or modifications, needed McNair to approve it first and then to put\n\nit on the Commission’s agenda for further approval.8 The sewer construction\n\ncontracts were awarded through a sealed bid process and would go to the lowest\n\n\n        8\n        For example, the December 1999 Commission Agenda shows a modification adding\n$1,081,621 (about 28% of the contract value) to a PUGH contract, and a $112,600 contract\naward to FWDE. The January 2000 Agenda indicates a modification adding $489,133 to a\nPUGH contract. The February 2000 Agendas indicate a modification adding $400,724 to a\nRAST contract, a $721,132 contract award to FWDE, and a modification adding $1,377,267 to a\nPUGH contract. The March 2000 Agenda indicates a $5,289,002 contract award to PUGH. The\nApril 2000 Agenda indicates contract awards of $994,640 and $348,103 to FWDE, a\nmodification adding $439,722 to a RAST contract, and a modification adding $850,264 to a\nPUGH contract.\n\n                                            12\n\fbidder. But the prospective contractors had to satisfy technical standards set by the\n\nPRC before they would be eligible to bid.\n\n       Once a new contract was awarded and in place, Chandler and other\n\nsupervisors, such as Ellis, could approve changed or additional work as “field\n\ndirectives.” If a requested change exceeded the original contract amount, Chandler\n\nand Ellis could recommend “change orders” (requests for additional funds), which\n\nMcNair would then approve and place on the Commission’s agenda, without\n\nfurther competitive bidding. The JCESD also could award “emergency” work to\n\nconstruction contractors without competitive bidding. For emergency jobs, Barber\n\ntypically selected the contractor, negotiated the price, and then sent the pay\n\nrequests to McNair, Swann, and Chandler for approval. Together, McNair, Swann,\n\nand Chandler approved a variety of contracts for the sewer project.9\n\n       The construction contractors’ work was supervised by independent\n\nconsulting engineers, whose jobs were to make sure the contractors performed\n\naccording to specifications and to sign off on payments and requests for change\n\norders. This supervision was provided by engineering firms such as FWDE, USI,\n\n\n       9\n        For example, Chandler, Swann, and McNair approved a $1,168,788.02 payment to\nPUGH for work done in January 2001. Chandler, Swann, and McNair approved a $2,652,820\npayment to PUGH for work done in June 2000. Chandler, Swann, and McNair approved a\n$1,000,000 payment to RAST in October 2000. Swann and McNair approved — in one day on\nan emergency basis without Chandler’s or the County engineer’s usual approval — a $1,152,888\npayment to RAST for work done in October 2000.\n\n                                             13\n\fand Dawson Engineering. The engineering consultant contracts were awarded\n\nwithout bidding. Swann and Chandler selected engineering firms, negotiated their\n\ncontracts, and recommended them to McNair for final approval.\n\n      The County’s PRC initially decided to qualify only three contractors to do\n\n“cured-in-place” work: W.L. Hailey (“Hailey”), Insituform, and Reynolds.\n\nBecause the traditional “dig-and-replace” work was grouped with “cured-in-place”\n\nwork for all the major construction contracts, this PRC decision effectively limited\n\nthe “big jobs” to only three bidders: a RAST-Hailey joint venture, a\n\nPUGH-Insituform joint venture, and Reynolds, which did its own dig-and-replace\n\nwork. In late 1999, the PRC changed the criteria, making it more difficult for other\n\ncontractors to pre-qualify for “cured-in-place” work, and potentially delaying by\n\ntwo years the qualification of otherwise qualified contractors.10\n\n      Contractor PUGH’s CEO Grady Pugh admitted to receiving a “general\n\nbenefit” from giving McNair “envelopes of cash,” in that “Jefferson County treated\n\nus real well. We had an opportunity to do a tremendous amount of work there.\n\nThe work that we did there generated huge profits . . . [I]t took our company\n\n[PUGH] from a normal struggling contracting company in [the] mid to late ‘90s, to\n\na thriving, wealthy, strong construction company.”\n\n\n\n      10\n           The PRC and its requirements are discussed more later in the Wilson trial section.\n\n                                                 14\n\f        During the relevant period, PUGH dedicated about 70% of its work to the\n\nJefferson County sewer rehabilitation and received tens of millions of dollars in\n\nrevenue from that sewer work. In 1996 and 1997, at the sewer rehabilitation’s\n\noutset, PUGH made gross profits of 10%, and as the project continued and\n\npayments were made to JCESD officials, the company’s sewer rehabilitation\n\nprofits increased to 50% in 1999, 40% in 2000, and 45% in 2001, making PUGH\n\ntens of millions of dollars each of these years.\n\n        RAST also received tens of millions of dollars in revenue per year from its\n\nJefferson County sewer work. And the engineering firms, including FWDE,\n\nreceived revenue in millions of dollars per year from their work on the sewer\n\nrehabilitation. McNair made the decision every time FWDE or Dawson\n\nEngineering was selected as the outside consulting engineer and awarded a\n\nprofessional service contract. After electrical contractor Gus Henson did some\n\nwork for McNair without charge, McNair had Swann arrange a County contract for\n\nhim, even though the County did not normally hire electrical engineers for sewer\n\nwork.\n\n        In total, from August 1999 to January 2002, Jefferson County paid $178\n\nmillion to PUGH, $100 million to RAST, $11.4 million to FWDE, and $8 million\n\nto Dawson Engineering.\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fB.     Bribes of McNair\n\n       McNair owned a small photography business called McNair Frame & Photo\n\nArt, Inc. (“McNair’s studio”). Between 1999 and early 2002, McNair started a\n\nmajor expansion and renovation of the studio, which would more than double its\n\nsize. McNair’s expansion included adding extras to the studio, such as an\n\napartment for his daughter, a second-story deck, external stairs, a “guard shack,”\n\nand a security gate.\n\n       All contractor-defendants in this case generously contributed to the\n\nrenovation and expansion of McNair’s studio. In 1999, FWDE’s President\n\nDougherty sent Bill Bailey, an FWDE employee initially hired as an inspector for\n\nCounty jobs, to work as the construction superintendent for the studio’s\n\nrenovation. FWDE paid Bailey for the approximately 18 months he spent working\n\nat McNair’s studio. During that time, FWDE paid Bailey $74,240. Although some\n\nof his time was charged to “administration,” FWDE President Dougherty charged\n\nsome of Bailey’s studio time to a JCESD sewer project. McNair was not charged\n\nfor Bailey’s work. As superintendent, FWDE’s Bailey oversaw construction at\n\nMcNair’s studio by numerous other contractors, including PUGH and RAST.11\n\n\n       11\n         As 404(b) evidence, the government showed that in addition to paying $74,240 to\nBailey, FWDE paid the salaries of its employees, Wayne Hendon and John Stanger, while they\nacted as construction superintendents overseeing renovation of JCESD Director Swann’s home.\nFWDE paid Hendon $94,090 and Stanger $28,839 for that work.\n\n                                             16\n\f      RAST excavated for the expansion’s footings for McNair’s studio. In July\n\n1999, PUGH ordered concrete and for four weeks had a four-man crew pour\n\nconcrete walls and do other work on the studio, paying the crew $11,709. PUGH’s\n\ncrew supervisor talked to McNair while the concrete work was in progress, but\n\nMcNair did not question why he was there or where he was from, nor did McNair\n\noffer to pay for this work.\n\n      In late 1999, FWDE’s Bailey asked Barry Mosley of Mosley Construction to\n\ndo wood framing and other finish work at McNair’s studio. McNair initially paid\n\nMosley, first with a check and then with cash, but eventually McNair stopped\n\npaying. Bobby Rast then told Bailey that “McNair was running out of funds” and\n\nthat RAST would begin paying Mosley directly. From July 2000 to December\n\n2000, RAST wrote 20 checks totaling $52,990 to Mosley as his work at the studio\n\nprogressed, and, at Bobby Rast’s direction, coded these payments as expenses on a\n\nJCESD sewer project. Either Bailey or someone from RAST’s office, such as\n\nDanny Rast, brought Mosley the checks.\n\n      In January 2002, RAST gave Mosley two more checks totaling $7,200 for\n\nwork he and his crew did on the studio’s “guard shack,” a two-story, 12 x 12\n\nbuilding designed by defendant Dougherty, and built, in part, by defendants RAST\n\nand FWDE. Bobby Rast caused these payments to be coded as expenses on the\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f“Upper Valley Rehab” or Kilsby contract, a JCESD sewer project. For tax\n\npurposes, all payments to Mosley were deducted as business expenses on sewer\n\nprojects. Mosley did no work on those projects. After a local newspaper reported\n\nRAST’s construction work at JCESD Director Swann’s home, RAST amended its\n\ntax returns for 1998-2000 and 2002 to eliminate these and other deductions. The\n\ndeductions, which totaled over $140,000, were based on expenditures for McNair’s\n\nstudio and Swann’s home that had been cost-coded to sewer projects and treated as\n\nbusiness expenses.\n\n      After the publicity, Bobby Rast told his bookkeeper in “effect that we really\n\ndidn’t need any document invoices in the files with Jack Swann’s or Chris\n\nMcNair’s shipping address on them.” The bookkeeper then located and discarded\n\nseveral invoices related to work at McNair’s studio and Swann’s home.\n\n      RAST furnished the labor and PUGH furnished the materials to construct a\n\nsecond-story deck for the rear of McNair’s studio. Bailey handwrote a list of\n\nmaterials and ordered the necessary steel. When Besco Steel Supply (“Besco”)\n\ndelivered the steel, its delivery tickets identified PUGH and Yessick as its\n\ncustomers and indicated some of the steel was for the Valley Creek Treatment\n\nPlant, a JCESD sewer job on which PUGH was the contractor and FWDE the\n\nconsulting engineer. In September 2000, PUGH paid Besco and charged the\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fJCESD for $3,773 worth of steel with FWDE’s approval, and RAST poured the\n\nconcrete deck and stairs, set the handrails, and built the steps.\n\n      Around September 2000, FWDE employee Dave Bechtel ordered two sets of\n\naluminum handrails for the studio deck and a staircase from Thompson\n\nFabricating, which was directed to bill PUGH. The $5,500 invoice for the first set\n\nof handrails charged the work as performed on the Valley Creek Treatment Plant\n\nand falsely indicated that the handrails were shipped there. In February 2001, an\n\n$11,700 invoice for the second set of handrails referenced “CHRIS MC.” as the\n\ncustomer, but also falsely indicated that the handrails were shipped to Valley Creek\n\nwhen in fact they were shipped to McNair’s studio. PUGH paid both invoices and\n\nbilled the County for the first set of handrails after adding a markup and charges\n\nfor labor and equipment. RAST installed the handrails.\n\n      In May 2000, at McNair’s request to Roland Pugh, Grady Pugh flew\n\nMcNair’s daughter and FWDE’s Bailey on PUGH’s airplane to Georgia, where\n\nthey picked out carpet for McNair’s studio. Before take-off, Roland Pugh told his\n\nson Grady Pugh that “McNair has called [again] and says that he’s broke and he\n\ndoesn’t have enough money to leave for the deposit on the carpet” and “[s]o, if you\n\nwould, write a check for the deposit.” Grady Pugh paid the deposit with a $4,820\n\nPUGH check made out to the Mill Store and had it treated on PUGH’s books as an\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fexpense on the “last rehab contract.”12\n\n       FWDE’s Bailey hired subcontractor Clint Gilley to install the carpet at\n\nMcNair’s studio. In October 2000, FWDE’s Bailey called RAST to request checks\n\nfor subcontractor Gilley. After Bobby Rast was consulted, RAST gave Gilley two\n\nchecks totaling $5,301 for his work at McNair’s studio.\n\n       In addition to paying for materials and providing work crews, PUGH also\n\nmade other contributions to McNair’s studio. When the project began in 1999,\n\nRoland Pugh told PUGH’s other three owners, Grady Pugh, Andy Pugh, and\n\nYessick, they had to give money to McNair because he was building a studio and,\n\nas 10% owners of the PUGH company, they had to “kick in” their share. Grady\n\nPugh gave approximately $1,500 in cash to Roland Pugh’s secretary that time.13\n\n       12\n         The Indictment alleges as an overt act on Count 1: “On or about May 24, 2000,\nDefendant ROLAND PUGH instructed Grady Pugh to fly an airplane owned by Defendant\nPUGH, INC. to LaGrange, Georgia, to buy carpet and flooring material for the benefit of\nDefendant McNAIR. . . . On or about May 24, 2000, Defendant ROLAND PUGH caused Grady\nPugh to pay $4,820 to The Mill Store, Inc. for carpet and tile for installation at McNair Studio\nfor the benefit of Defendant McNAIR.”\n       13\n          The government also presented evidence of cash allegedly given to McNair. Roland\nPugh collected money from the other owners to give to McNair. On July 18 and 19, 2000,\nRoland Pugh, Grady Pugh, and Yessick wrote checks to cash (totaling $9,000) in proportion to\ntheir ownership interests. Roland Pugh gave Grady Pugh an envelope of money and asked him\nto give it to McNair. Grady Pugh took the envelope to the studio where he saw Bailey and told\nhim he was there to help McNair. Grady Pugh stated the money was “financial help” that\nMcNair needed at that time. Grady Pugh then met with McNair for a few minutes and left the\nenvelope with McNair.\n        When the studio needed an air conditioning system, McNair again called Roland Pugh\nasking PUGH to pay for it. Roland Pugh told Grady Pugh that McNair needed $40,000, but that\n“y’all don’t have to put up any money this time, I’m going to do it in a different way.” Roland\nPugh gave a $10,000 check dated December 22, 2000 to Grady Pugh’s wife, Genae Pugh, who\n\n                                               20\n\f       McNair also wanted a security gate for the studio. In August 2000, Danny\n\nRast hired subcontractor Master Access Controls (“MAC”) to install an electronic\n\ngate and agreed that RAST would provide the electrical conduit, wiring, and\n\nconcrete pad for the gate’s motor. MAC met with FWDE’s Bailey at McNair’s\n\nstudio site, installed the gate, and sent its invoices to the attention of Danny Rast.\n\nRAST paid the subcontractor $5,866.92. McNair paid nothing.\n\n       Also in December 2000, at Danny Rast’s request, RAST gave Bailey &\n\nSons’ Bobcat Service, owned by Danny Bailey, a $5,500 check for landscaping at\n\nMcNair’s studio. However, RAST’s records indicated Danny Bailey was working\n\non a JCESD sewer project. Although Danny Bailey had done work for RAST\n\nbefore, he did not send the invoice for the studio work through regular billing, as\n\nhe normally would, but instead sent it “Atten Dan Rast.”14\n\n\ncashed it and gave the money to Roland Pugh. That same day, Roland Pugh wrote a $10,000\ncheck to Angie Pugh (Andy Pugh’s wife) and a $9,750 check to cash. A week earlier Roland\nPugh had written a $9,000 check to cash. Around Christmas 2000, at Roland Pugh’s request,\nGrady Pugh picked up another envelope containing cash from Roland Pugh’s secretary, went to\nMcNair’s house, spoke with him for a few minutes, and put the money down on a couch with\nMcNair watching.\n       It appears from the closing arguments that all of the above cash and checks relate to\nCounts 4, 13 and 14 (on which the defendants were acquitted).\n       14\n          Huffman Electric was hired to do electrical work at McNair’s studio by FWDE but was\ntold to bill RAST. When Huffman sent an $11,252 invoice to RAST in November 1999 without\nmaking it to the attention of Bobby or Danny Rast, RAST’s vice president, Roy Weaver,\nresponded that they “have no job at this location.” Huffman then began billing McNair directly.\nAt first McNair paid the bills, but he eventually fell behind in his payments and owed\napproximately $45,000 by July 2000. Around this time, Grady Pugh allegedly made a delivery\nof cash to McNair, and RAST took over paying for Mosley’s wood framing services.\n\n                                              21\n\f      In November 2000, McNair asked Dawson Engineering to contribute to the\n\nstudio’s renovation. After McNair called William Dawson, the founder of Dawson\n\nEngineering, the two met at McNair’s studio. McNair handed Dawson a brochure\n\nfor an audiovisual system and told Dawson that, while McNair had “never asked\n\n[Dawson] for anything before,” he needed to ask Dawson to “help [him] with\n\nsomething.” McNair opened the brochure to a specific page, showed it to Dawson,\n\nand indicated he wanted Dawson to pay for the equipment and its installation.\n\nDawson went to Holt Audio Video (“Holt”) and purchased the equipment for\n\n$16,400. Dawson testified he would not have done this for McNair if McNair had\n\nnot been associated with the sewer rehabilitation process. When Dawson saw the\n\ninvoice indicated the bill was for Dawson Engineering but the shipment was for\n\nMcNair’s studio, he became “uncomfortable with the whole situation” and asked\n\nHolt to alter the shipping information by putting a sticker over the McNair studio’s\n\naddress, which Holt did. Dawson later pled guilty to conspiring to commit bribery.\n\n      Work at the studio continued after Commissioner McNair retired in March\n\n2001. FWDE’s Bailey hired Buchanan Plumbing and Sewer Service (“Buchanan”)\n\nto plumb the “guard shack.” In November 2001, FWDE employees signed\n\nBuchanan’s $1,775 in invoices and sent them to RAST, which paid them. RAST\n\nrecorded the payments as “Plumbing Work at Kilsby Circle,” a sewer project, even\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fthough Buchanan never did any work there.\n\n       After McNair’s retirement, Roland Pugh told Grady Pugh “that GD [sic]\n\nMcNair has called again, and he wants us to do some work over in Arkansas” and\n\n“surely this is the last time we’ll have to do anything for him since he’s out of\n\noffice.” Grady Pugh flew with McNair to Arkansas to look at the site and plans.\n\nFollowing this visit, PUGH’s Yessick hired George Word, an Arkansas building\n\ncontractor, in August 2001 to build a 3,000-square-foot retirement home for\n\nMcNair. Both PUGH and FWDE paid for its construction.15 PUGH’s checkbook\n\ncarried the notation “Gift per Eddie [Yessick]. No job.” After McNair’s\n\nretirement, RAST also continued to perform work at McNair’s studio and paid\n\n$8,135.78 for McNair and his wife to take a cruise to Alaska in September 2001.16\n\nC.     Bribes of Chandler and Ellis\n\n       The Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants also gave, at no charge, goods,\n\n\n       15\n         After McNair’s retirement, PUGH paid George Word $44,192.75 in the first half of\nOctober 2001, and, at Yessick’s instruction, internally charged the expense to miscellaneous\njobs/construction materials. McNair told George Word that FWDE would make the next\npayment. On October 24, 2001, after FWDE’s bookkeeper Rick Brinson saw Dougherty\nspeaking with McNair in FWDE’s parking lot, Dougherty asked the bookkeeper to write a\n$50,000 check to a construction company. About 20 to 30 minutes later, George Word’s\n$50,000 invoice, dated a day earlier, arrived by fax. The bookkeeper wrote the check, gave it to\nDougherty, and made an extra copy of the paperwork and kept it at home. Upon being\nsubpoenaed for these records later, the bookkeeper searched FWDE’s records, but could not find\nthe invoice. The only copy he found was the extra one he kept at home.\n       16\n         After McNair’s retirement, on May 14 and 15, 2001, PUGH, FWDE, and Bobby Rast\neach gave McNair a check for $5,000 (totaling $15,000). Bobby Rast’s check was for a\n“retirement gift” and FWDE’s was for a “motor home.”\n\n                                               23\n\fservices, labor, materials, and other things of value to (1) JCESD Assistant\n\nDirector Chandler, and (2) JCESD Engineer and PRC Director Ellis. At a lunch,\n\nPUGH’s President Yessick offered to landscape Chandler’s home. Chandler at\n\nfirst refused, but weeks later Yessick offered again, and Chandler accepted. PUGH\n\nprovided crews and paid for the materials for the extensive landscaping, including\n\ngrading, drainage work, and new sod, as well as construction of a patio, walkway,\n\nand retaining walls. Chandler paid nothing for that work.\n\n        In October 2001, Yessick arranged and paid for a $610 condo rental for the\n\nChandler family vacation at the Pelican Beach Resort in Destin, Florida.17\n\nChandler asked for, and PUGH delivered, a load of sand for Chandler’s house for\n\nfree.\n\n        In the spring of 2002, Chandler asked Bobby Rast to help with his expenses\n\nfor a trip to Europe to attend technical conferences. Ellis planned to attend too. At\n\nRAST’s office, Bobby Rast gave Chandler an envelope containing $5,000 in cash\n\nand told Chandler to split the money with Ellis. Chandler had expected $250 to\n\n$500 and was “uncomfortable and thought about giving it back, but [he] didn’t.”\n\n\n\n\n        17\n        The government also presented evidence that in April 2000, PUGH’s Yessick invited\nChandler on a fishing trip to Bienville Plantation in Florida, where the trip was paid for by\nPUGH. Grady Pugh arranged to have Yessick and Chandler fly to Florida in the PUGH\ncompany’s airplane. The jury acquitted PUGH and Yessick on Count 70, which referenced this\ntrip.\n\n                                              24\n\fInstead, Chandler “eventually gave half” to Ellis.18 The Dougherty defendants also\n\ngave Chandler tickets to Disney World and a trip to San Antonio.\n\nD.     The Defense\n\n       For the most part, the defendants did not dispute that they provided, at no\n\ncharge, these goods, services, labor, materials, and other things of value to\n\nCommissioner McNair.19 Instead, the defendants argued they lacked the “corrupt”\n\nintent necessary for bribery and that the government had failed to prove the\n\nrequired quid pro quo for the benefits provided to McNair. The defendants also\n\nasserted they helped McNair based on their friendship with him or for goodwill. In\n\nsupport, defense witnesses testified to McNair’s decades-long friendship with\n\nRoland Pugh, Dougherty, and the Rast family, and described how the contractor-\n\ndefendants frequently performed work for McNair at no charge. The contractor-\n\ndefendants also contended their experience, skills, and business reputation were\n\nstrong enough so that they did not need to resort to bribery to win County\n\ncontracts.\n\n       The defense spent considerable time attacking the credibility of Grady Pugh,\n\n\n\n       18\n          Other JCESD employees also received cash from the contractors. Danny Rast gave\n$1,500-$2,000 in cash to JCESD Field Supervisor Larry Creel, who sometimes awarded\nemergency work. PUGH gave $500 in cash to Creel for airplane tickets after Creel asked for a\nflight on PUGH’s company airplane.\n       19\n            Roland Pugh is the only defendant to dispute that he gave anything to McNair.\n\n                                                 25\n\fincluding inconsistencies in his testimony. The defense suggested he was lying out\n\nof hatred for his father Roland Pugh and to obtain a favorable sentence\n\nrecommendation from the government.\n\n       The government countered the defendants’ corrupt-intent arguments by\n\noffering 404(b) evidence of similar items of value the same contractors had\n\nprovided for Swann, Wilson, and Barber (who were not defendants in the McNair\n\ntrial). The government argued the large scale and overall pattern of these payments\n\nwere inconsistent with the defendants’ claims that they were favors undertaken\n\nmerely out of friendship for McNair. The government also presented evidence that\n\nMcNair made numerous unexplained cash deposits.20\n\nE.     Jury’s Verdicts\n\n       Before sending the case to the jury, the district court dismissed several\n\nsubstantive counts that charged bribes to McNair after his retirement in March\n\n2001, and struck the corresponding overt acts from the conspiracy count (Count 1),\n\nreasoning that 18 U.S.C. § 666 (the bribery statute) could not apply when McNair\n\nwas no longer a public official.\n\n       In the McNair trial, the jury convicted defendants McNair, PUGH, Roland\n\n\n\n       20\n         In the McNair trial, the government did not explain the source of the cash deposits. But\nin the USI case, the government showed these cash deposits corresponded with cash withdrawals\nfrom USI, Singh, and Key. See US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1206.\n\n                                               26\n\fPugh, Yessick, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty on Count\n\n1 of conspiring to bribe McNair. Count 1 alleged 54 overt acts originally. Several\n\novert acts were dismissed pre-trial, but Count 1, as submitted to the jury, charged\n\n39 overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n      As to bribes by the Pugh defendants, the jury convicted defendant McNair\n\non these substantive bribery counts: 2 ($5,500 for hand railings) and 3 ($11,700 for\n\nhand railings). The jury convicted defendant PUGH on Count 15 (same hand\n\nrailing facts as Counts 2 and 3). The jury convicted defendants PUGH and Yessick\n\non Count 71 ($610 for Chandler condominium rental).\n\n      As to bribes by the Rast defendants, the jury convicted defendant McNair on\n\nthese substantive bribery counts: 5 ($52,990 for carpentry work by Barry Mosley),\n\n6 ($5,866 for security gate installation by Master Access Controls), 7 ($5,300 for\n\ncarpet installation by Clint Gilley), 8 ($5,500 for landscaping work by Bailey &\n\nSons), 9 (several thousand dollars for fabrication and construction of stairs), and 10\n\n(several thousand dollars for concrete deck construction). The jury also convicted\n\ndefendants RAST and Bobby Rast on Counts 19-22 (same facts as Counts 5-8,\n\nrespectively), 72 ($2,500 cash to Chandler by RAST and Bobby Rast), and 87\n\n($1,000 cash to Ellis by RAST and Bobby Rast). RAST was also convicted on\n\nCounts 23 (same facts as Count 9) and 24 (same facts as Count 10). The jury\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fconvicted defendant Danny Rast on Counts 19, 20, and 22 (same facts as Counts 5,\n\n6, and 8).\n\n       Defendant McNair was also convicted on Counts 11 ($27,434 by the\n\nDougherty defendants for project management and supervision by Bailey) and 12\n\n($16,400 by Dawson for installation of audio visual system). The jury convicted\n\ndefendants FWDE and Dougherty on Count 28 (same facts as Count 11).21\n\n       In summary, the jury convicted defendant McNair on the bribery conspiracy\n\ncount and ten substantive bribery counts. The jury convicted defendants PUGH,\n\nRoland Pugh, and Yessick on the bribery conspiracy count; defendant PUGH on\n\ntwo substantive bribery counts; and defendant Yessick on one substantive bribery\n\ncount. The jury convicted defendants RAST, Bobby Rast, and Danny Rast on the\n\nbribery conspiracy count; defendant RAST on eight substantive bribery counts;\n\ndefendant Bobby Rast on six substantive bribery counts; and defendant Danny Rast\n\non three substantive bribery counts. The jury convicted defendants FWDE and\n\nDougherty on the bribery conspiracy count and on one substantive bribery count\n\n\n       21\n         In the McNair trial, the jury acquitted defendant McNair on Count 4 ($30,000 cash from\nthe Pugh defendants), defendants PUGH and Yessick on Count 13 ($20,000 cash to McNair) and\non Count 70 ($1,000 trip for Chandler to Bienville Plantation, Florida), and defendants PUGH\nand Roland Pugh on Count 14 ($10,000 cash to McNair). The $30,000 in Count 4 appears to\nconsist of the cash in Counts 13 and 14.\n        The McNair jury also acquitted defendant Danny Rast on Count 21 ($5,300 bribe of\nMcNair for carpet installation through Clint Gilley), defendants RAST and Danny Rast on Count\n89 ($1,000 cash to JCESD employee Larry Creel), and defendants RAST and Bobby Rast on\nCount 126 (obstruction of justice in connection with withholding items from the grand jury).\n\n                                              28\n\feach. All defendants but Yessick appeal all conviction counts.\n\n                           III. THE SWANN TRIAL (05-544)\n\n       The Swann trial, held from September 19 to October 2, 2006, involved more\n\nthan $330,000 in bribes paid to County employee Swann by the Pugh, Rast, and\n\nDougherty defendants. The government called 25 witnesses, including Wilson,\n\nChandler, and Ellis. The defense called 20 witnesses, including Grady Pugh. No\n\nnamed defendants testified except for Swann.\n\n       The government’s witnesses described in great detail the bribes to Swann\n\nand how Swann financially helped the Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants in\n\ntheir contracts with and payments from Jefferson County. And to counter the\n\ndefendants’ lack-of-corrupt-intent defense, the government introduced 404(b)\n\nevidence describing bribes that the same Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants\n\ngave to McNair, Barber, Wilson, and Chandler.22\n\nA.     Swann Helps Contractor-Defendants\n\n       JCESD Director Jack Swann reported directly to Commissioner McNair. It\n\nwas Swann’s responsibility to implement the EPA consent decree, which included\n\nrecommending engineering firms to McNair and negotiating the scope and price of\n\n\n\n       22\n          For example, in the Swann trial, the government presented evidence about how RAST\nbought Barber a piece of land. This evidence is outlined later in this opinion under the Barber\ntrial evidence. Defendant Barber pled guilty to this charge.\n\n                                               29\n\fno-bid engineering contracts, such as with FWDE. Swann supervised the sewer\n\nwork and made recommendations to McNair for payment approvals and change\n\norders. Swann also was able to grant time extensions and field directives that\n\ngreatly benefitted RAST and PUGH.\n\n      For example, in May 1998, the JCESD awarded the Vestavia Trunk Sewer\n\nReplacement project to PUGH. PUGH’s failure to meet the project’s May 17,\n\n2000 completion date would trigger a liquidated damages clause, obligating PUGH\n\nto pay $1,000 per day. In March 2000, PUGH was running far behind schedule on\n\nthis project and requested a 120-day extension to the May 17 completion date.\n\nSwann initially denied PUGH’s request.\n\n      On June 13, 2000, PUGH renewed its request, this time for a 180-day\n\nextension. On July 10 — five days after PUGH’s Yessick hired Guthrie\n\nLandscaping (“Guthrie”) to landscape Swann’s property — Swann granted\n\nPUGH’s request for a 180-day extension to the May 17 completion date. Swann’s\n\nextension saved PUGH $180,000 in potential liquidated damages.\n\n      In July 2000, the JCESD awarded the Valley Creek Trunk Relief Tunnel\n\nproject (designed by FWDE) to RAST and its joint venture partner W.L. Hailey.\n\nIn December 2001, during the first phase of the project, RAST’s tunnel-boring\n\nmachine became stuck in the ground. An independent engineer concluded the\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\fmachine became stuck because RAST may have discounted certain information in\n\na geotechnical survey. And the JCESD’s supervising engineer faulted RAST for\n\nusing “the wrong machine.” Nevertheless, Swann authorized RAST to remove the\n\nmachine at a cost of $2.6 million to Jefferson County.\n\n      Further, Swann declined to invoke the performance bond against RAST,\n\nwhich would have guaranteed the project’s completion at the original contract\n\nprice of $27.8 million. Instead, RAST won a re-bid for an additional contract\n\nworth $23.8 million. Consequently, the County effectively paid RAST over $50\n\nmillion for work RAST was obligated to perform under the original $27.8 million\n\ncontract.\n\n      Swann also approved a lucrative field directive that benefitted PUGH\n\n($827,417) and three that benefitted RAST ($2,020,367). Although in the\n\nCounty’s internal accounting system Swann recorded the County’s payments to the\n\nRAST-Hailey joint venture for each of these field directives as payments for the\n\nValley Creek Tunnel Relief project, none of the field directives involved work on\n\nthat project. Swann also exercised great influence over the selection of engineers,\n\nlike FWDE.\n\nB.    Bribes of Swann\n\n      In 1998, Swann and his wife Nila purchased a house two doors down from\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\ftheir own residence. The Swanns lived in their residence while they renovated\n\ntheir new home. Between September 1998 and June 2002, the Swanns put over\n\n$600,000 worth of additions and improvements into their new home. FWDE,\n\nRAST, and PUGH provided Swann, at no charge, more than $330,000 in goods,\n\nservices, labor, and materials for that work. For certain improvements paid for by\n\nFWDE, Swann admitted he did not reimburse FWDE or Dougherty. As they had\n\ndone for the McNair studio project, the contractor-defendants worked together on\n\nSwann’s new home. While the work was going on, Swann periodically came over\n\nto observe the work at the new home. While Swann was recommending and\n\napproving JCESD actions worth millions of dollars, the contractor-defendants were\n\nproviding hundreds of thousands of dollars in materials and services to renovate\n\nand expand Swann’s new home.\n\n      Specifically, in the fall of 1998, Dougherty sent FWDE supervisors Wayne\n\nHendon and Bill Bailey to meet with Swann and his wife about plans to remodel\n\ntheir new home. Over the course of the three-year project, FWDE employees\n\ncontinually supervised the remodeling of the new home. From about October 1999\n\nto March 2001, FWDE paid employee John Stanger $28,839 for his work at\n\nSwann’s home. During that time period, FWDE’s Hendon spent half of every\n\nwork day supervising other contractors at Swann’s home and billed his time as a\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fnonpaying job. FWDE paid Hendon $94,090 for his work at Swann’s home. In\n\nthe fall of 1998, FWDE hired subcontractor Dudley Davis for framing, costing\n\nover $28,000. Dougherty visited the site periodically.\n\n      In the winter of 1999, Bobby Rast sent RAST superintendent Luke Cobb to\n\nsupervise RAST crews who did demolition work and poured concrete for Swann’s\n\nnew home. Bobby Rast had RAST employee Derek Houston serve as a point of\n\ncontact for RAST’s suppliers and subcontractors for Swann’s home and paid\n\nHouston $6,300 for his work there. In 2000, RAST paid its employees $18,867.20\n\nin miscellaneous labor costs for their work on Swann’s home and McNair’s studio.\n\nRAST avoided using Swann’s name on invoices, delivery tickets, and internal\n\naccounting reports, instead using his nickname, “Little Big Man.”\n\n      RAST also bought bricks and other materials, and paid different\n\nsubcontractors for installation of hardwood floors and stairs and exterior\n\nbrickwork, plumbing work, and painting. RAST paid $3,535 for flooring and\n\nstairs installation that Don’s Carpet One performed at Swann’s new home in 2000\n\nor 2001. In the fall of 1999, RAST paid $1,964 for brick and mortar work by\n\nAlabama Brick Delivery. In the fall of 2000, RAST paid Kimro Painting &\n\nServices, Inc. (“Kimro Painting”) $9,733 for painting work at Swann’s new home.\n\nIn May 2001, RAST paid $4,441.50 to Sherman International for concrete work.\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fThe delivery ticket for ready-mix concrete RAST purchased from Sherman\n\nInternational directed delivery to the Swann address but identified it as the “Rast\n\nResidence.” In October 2001, RAST paid Brown Mechanical Contractors, Inc.\n\n(“Brown Mechanical”) for $9,540 worth of plumbing work performed at Swann’s\n\nnew home. Bobby Rast had the payments to Brown Mechanical coded as expenses\n\nto RAST’s Jefferson County contracts for “Annual Rehab” and “Minor Pump\n\nStation.”\n\n      In the summer of 2000, PUGH began contributing to Swann’s new home\n\nremodeling. PUGH’s President Yessick hired subcontractor Aquatic Gardens to\n\ninstall a waterfall and koi pond at a cost of $7,422. Yessick told Aquatic Gardens\n\nto send its invoices to PUGH and not mention Swann by name.\n\n      Yessick hired other subcontractors for various work after Swann claimed to\n\nhave overpaid for the remodeling. Yessick hired Guthrie to help landscape\n\nSwann’s new home, and in July 2000 Guthrie gave an initial estimate of $40,000.\n\nPUGH’s book entries and invoices for Guthrie’s work on Swann’s home were\n\nnever kept in Swann’s name, but always under some other code. Yessick had\n\nPUGH’s accountant charge Guthrie’s expenses to “Metro Park Roadway,” a\n\nJefferson County job. By December 2001, PUGH had paid Guthrie $93,680 for its\n\nlandscaping work at the Swann home, which included $1,200 a month for ongoing\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fweekly yard maintenance.\n\n       In January 2002, PUGH’s President Yessick asked Guthrie to stop\n\nsubmitting invoices to PUGH, and instead PUGH advanced Guthrie $47,000 for\n\nthree years worth of landscaping and maintenance on Swann’s new home; and\n\nGuthrie performed about $10,000 worth of work. Although PUGH’s manager of\n\naccounts testified she filed Guthrie’s invoices regularly and that PUGH kept these\n\nrecords for 5 to 7 years, the invoices were not found during the government’s\n\ninvestigation.23 In December 2001, Yessick used a PUGH check to buy $1,000\n\nworth of bookstore gift certificates for Swann.24\n\n       In August 2002, after Grady Pugh and Yessick heard rumors of a\n\ngovernment investigation, Guthrie was asked to stop working on Swann’s\n\nproperty, even though there was a balance remaining on the advance Yessick had\n\ngiven to Guthrie. At that time, Yessick directed his assistant to send an invoice to\n\nSwann’s mother-in-law for $12,572 for tree removal and “remodeling work.” In\n\n\n       23\n         Count 101 ($47,000 check from Guthrie) was dismissed on the government’s motion\nduring the third day of trial. On that trial day, Paul Guthrie (the owner of Guthrie) testified that,\neven though Guthrie received a $47,000 check from PUGH’s Yessick for Guthrie’s work at\nSwann’s home, Guthrie to date had done about $10,000 worth of work on Swann’s home, not\n$47,000. Swann was convicted on Count 52, which charges him with receiving approximately\n$100,000 in work done by Guthrie.\n       24\n         The government also presented evidence that Bobby and Danny Rast used at least\n$4,000 of RAST’s funds to pay for Swann’s expenses on two trips to England. Swann and the\nRast defendants were acquitted on Counts 59 (Swann accepted $3,015 trips to England and\nScotland) and 68 (Rast defendants paid Swann for those trips).\n\n                                                  35\n\fSeptember 2002, Yessick instructed his assistant to create an invoice, this time to\n\nSwann’s mother, for $46,684 of landscaping work. In November 2002, the\n\nSwanns paid PUGH this amount with checks drawn from joint checking accounts\n\nthe Swanns had taken out with their mothers, after taking out two home equity\n\nloans in each of their mothers’ names.25\n\nC.     The Defense\n\n       In the Swann trial, the defense basically was that the defendants lacked the\n\ncorrupt intent to commit bribery and acted at all times in good faith. The\n\ncontractor-defendants contended they performed work on Swann’s home out of\n\ngoodwill and without expecting anything in return. Swann argued he did not have\n\nan intent to be influenced by the things the contractor-defendants gave him.\n\n       In addition, the defendants presented evidence showing that Nila Swann\n\n(Swann’s wife) had an engineering background, acted as her own general\n\ncontractor, hired and supervised subcontractors, and initially paid the bills for the\n\nwork on the Swann home. Swann testified that Nila handled all of the couple’s\n\nfinancial matters and that he assumed she was paying for the work. According to\n\nSwann, Nila frequently changed her mind, was not a good manager, and disputed\n\nthe cost and scope of the work with the subcontractors. Dougherty and the Rast\n\n\n       25\n        The plan all along had been for the Swanns’ mothers to move into the old home after\nthe new home was built.\n\n                                              36\n\fbrothers were longtime friends of Nila and Jack Swann. Swann stated that\n\nDougherty and the Rast brothers stepped in only to offer advice and take over\n\nsupervision to make the work go more smoothly. The contractor-defendants\n\nclaimed that they paid several of these disputed bills to preserve their own business\n\nrelationships with the subcontractors and their expectation was that the Swanns\n\nwould eventually reimburse them. However, with the sole exception of PUGH’s\n\nbelated invoices to Swann for landscaping and remodeling work, there was no\n\nevidence that the Swanns paid the contractor-defendants for the work at their new\n\nhome.\n\n        As to the conspiracy charge, the defendants also claimed that the\n\ngovernment had not presented sufficient evidence to show an unlawful agreement\n\nbetween Swann and any of the contractor-defendants.\n\n        In the Swann trial, the government presented 404(b) evidence about similar\n\nitems of value the same contractor-defendants had provided to McNair for his\n\nstudio, their help with McNair’s home in Arkansas, and other benefits they\n\nprovided for McNair, Barber, and Chandler.\n\nD.      Jury’s Verdicts\n\n        The jury convicted defendants Swann, PUGH, Yessick, RAST, Bobby Rast,\n\nFWDE, and Dougherty of conspiring to bribe Swann (Count 51).\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f       The jury convicted Swann on these substantive bribery counts: 52 ($100,000\n\nfrom PUGH through subcontractor Guthrie Landscaping), 53 ($7,422 from PUGH\n\nthrough subcontractor Aquatic Gardens), and 54 ($1,000 in gift certificates to\n\nAlabama Book Smith from PUGH). The jury convicted defendants PUGH and\n\nYessick on Counts 61-63 (same facts as 52-54, respectively).\n\n       The jury convicted defendants Swann, PUGH, and Yessick on Counts\n\n90-100 (honest services mail fraud involving PUGH’s paying $93,680 in checks to\n\nGuthrie for landscaping work performed for Swann).\n\n       The jury also convicted defendant Swann on Counts 57 ($9,733 in painting\n\nby Kimro Painting from RAST) and 58 ($8,940 in plumbing by Brown Mechanical\n\nfrom RAST) and defendants RAST and Bobby Rast on Counts 66 and 67 (same\n\nfacts as Counts 57 and 58, respectively).26\n\n       The jury also convicted defendant Swann on Count 60 ($24,176 for\n\nconstruction supervision by FWDE’s Stanger) and defendants FWDE and\n\n\n\n\n       26\n         In the Swann trial, the jury acquitted defendant Danny Rast on Count 51 (conspiracy to\nbribe Swann), on Count 66 ($9,733 in painting work for Swann by Kimro Painting) and on\nCount 67 ($8,940 in plumbing work for Swann by Brown Mechanical).\n        The jury also acquitted defendant Swann on Count 59 ($3,015 bribe received by Swann\nfrom the Rast defendants in the form of England and Scotland trips); defendants RAST, Bobby\nRast, and Danny Rast on Count 68 ($3,015 bribe given to Swann in the form of England and\nScotland trips); and defendant PUGH on Count 125 (obstruction of justice).\n\n                                               38\n\fDougherty on Count 69 (same facts as Count 60).27\n\n       In summary, the jury convicted defendant Swann on the bribery conspiracy\n\ncount, six substantive bribery counts, and eleven honest services mail fraud counts.\n\nThe jury convicted defendants PUGH and Yessick on the bribery conspiracy count,\n\nthree substantive bribery counts, and eleven honest services mail fraud counts. The\n\njury convicted defendants RAST and Bobby Rast on the bribery conspiracy count\n\nand two substantive bribery counts. The jury convicted FWDE and Dougherty on\n\nthe bribery conspiracy count and one substantive bribery count. Defendants\n\nSwann, PUGH, RAST, Bobby Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty appeal all conviction\n\ncounts.\n\n\n\n\n       27\n          When the Indictment was severed into the five separate cases for trial, Counts 107-121\nof the Indictment were scheduled to be tried in the Wilson trial (05-545). The government later\ndismissed Counts 107-121 and re-filed them essentially as Counts 1-17 in a new indictment\ndocketed as case number 06-084. This case (06-084) was consolidated for trial with the Swann\ntrial (05-544).\n         The Swann jury heard evidence on these 17 counts of honest services mail fraud under 18\nU.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1346. In November 1999, Wilson resigned from the JCESD and formed his\nown engineering consulting firm, CEDS. With Swann’s help, Wilson immediately obtained two\nno-bid engineering contracts ($483,000 and $350,000) from the County worth a total of\n$833,000. To get around “revolving door” provisions in Alabama’s ethics law that prohibited\nformer employees from doing business with the County for two years, Wilson made\narrangements for his firm to operate as FWDE’s “subcontractor.” FWDE was awarded the\ncontracts. Even though Wilson’s firm performed the work, FWDE passed Wilson’s invoices on\nto the County under FWDE’s own name. These 17 counts of honest services mail fraud related\nto money paid to CEDS.\n         Wilson and CEDS pled guilty to one count each and are not defendant-appellants in the\nSwann appeal. The Swann jury acquitted Swann, FWDE, and Dougherty on these 17 counts\ninvolving money paid to CEDS through FWDE. This evidence was introduced only in the\nSwann trial, not in the Wilson trial.\n\n                                               39\n\f                       IV. THE WILSON TRIAL (05-545)\n\n      In the Wilson trial, held from June 1 to 13, 2006, defendants Wilson and\n\nPUGH were charged with conspiring to commit bribery (Count 75). Defendant\n\nWilson was charged with accepting from PUGH a $4,500 bribe in the form of a\n\nscholarship for his son to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham\n\n(“UAB”) (Count 76). The defense argued that the scholarship was not intended as\n\na bribe.\n\n      The government called 9 witnesses, including Chandler, Grady Pugh, and\n\nRoland Pugh’s secretary Janice Kuykendall. The defense called 3 witnesses.\n\nA.    Wilson Helps PUGH\n\n      Defendant Wilson was the Chief Civil Engineer for the JCESD and served\n\non the PRC. As Chief Civil Engineer, Wilson was in charge of all sewer line work.\n\nWilson was also the project engineer on several construction contracts, including\n\nsome of PUGH’s. As project engineer, defendant Wilson approved all sewer\n\ncontractor pay requests, which were submitted monthly, before sending them on to\n\nChandler, the JCESD’s Assistant Director. Project engineers also approved\n\nrequests for extensions of time to complete contracts. Contractors were subject to\n\na penalty of $1,000 per day if they failed to complete a contract on time.\n\n      On July 26, 1999, PUGH submitted to USI — the outside consulting\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fengineer for the “Village East 3” contract — a request for a 175-day extension to\n\ncomplete work on the project. The completion date was May 11, 1999. On July\n\n27, 1999, USI forwarded the request to defendant Wilson. When PUGH requested\n\nthe 175-day extension on July 26, it was already 76 days overdue. PUGH was at\n\nrisk for a $76,000 penalty — $1,000 in liquidated damages for each of the 76 days.\n\n      On August 20, 1999, defendant Wilson faxed Grady Pugh a letter instructing\n\nhim to send $4,500 to UAB for Wilson’s son. On August 23, defendant Wilson\n\napproved the extension. This saved PUGH not only the $76,000 penalty for the\n\ndelay from May 11 to July 26 but also $1,000 per day for each day until PUGH\n\ncompleted the job. On August 24, 1999, PUGH sent a $4,500 check to UAB for\n\nWilson’s son.\n\n      In addition, defendant Wilson served on the PRC, which set technical\n\nstandards for construction firms who bid on contracts for the County’s sewer\n\nproject. Some of the projects called for “cured-in-place” (“CIP”) or “trenchless”\n\ntechniques for replacing existing sewer lines. In the late 1990s, this was a\n\nrelatively new technology, and only a handful of contractors had the expertise to\n\ndo it properly. Like other municipalities, Jefferson County required contractors to\n\nmeet specified minimum requirements for prior experience before they were\n\npermitted to bid on CIP work.\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f      In September 1999, the PRC significantly tightened these requirements,\n\nmaking it more difficult for new contractors to pre-qualify. However, the three\n\ncontractors who were already doing CIP work in Jefferson County were\n\ngrandfathered in and did not have to go through the pre-qualification process. Two\n\nof those three CIP contractors were joint venture partners with RAST and PUGH.\n\nAlthough the three contractors did compete against each other in a sealed bidding\n\nprocess, Jefferson County’s qualification requirements cut down the number of\n\ncompetitors and enabled these CIP contractors to charge Jefferson County higher\n\nprices than they could charge other municipalities for similar work. When two\n\nnon-local competitors finally qualified to join the bidding in 2001, prices quickly\n\ndropped from over $50 per linear foot to about $28.\n\n      The government also offered 404(b) evidence showing certain items of value\n\nthat PUGH provided for McNair, Chandler, and Barber, and that RAST provided\n\nfor Wilson,28 and the favorable decisions PUGH obtained from the JCESD. Grady\n\nPugh offered similar testimony, and, as in the McNair trial, the defense again\n\nattempted to impeach Grady Pugh by pointing out inconsistencies in his testimony,\n\nhis hatred of his father (Roland Pugh), and his efforts to obtain a favorable\n\nsentencing recommendation from the government.\n\n\n\n      28\n           RAST paid for Wilson to spend a week in London and a weekend in Paris with his wife.\n\n                                               42\n\fB.    Bribes of Wilson\n\n      Sometime in mid-1999, defendant Wilson complained to Grady Pugh over\n\nlunch about the cost of college and that he might not be able to afford to send his\n\nson Justin to UAB for the upcoming semester (fall 1999). Grady Pugh responded\n\nthat PUGH “had done a lot” for “colleges and education” and suggested PUGH\n\nmight “sponsor a scholarship,” but wanted to make sure “we couldn’t get in any\n\ntrouble for it.” Sometime in August 1999, Wilson called Grady Pugh to accept the\n\nscholarship offer.\n\n      As noted above, on August 20, 1999, defendant Wilson used a JCESD fax\n\nmachine to send Grady Pugh a letter expressing his gratitude and instructing him to\n\nsend a $4,500 check to UAB to credit Wilson’s son’s account. PUGH sent the\n\ncheck to UAB four days later. There was no evidence that the son ever sent PUGH\n\nan application for the scholarship. Grady Pugh’s secretary typed the letter and\n\nsigned Grady Pugh’s name. Grady Pugh never met nor spoke with Wilson’s son\n\nbefore sending the $4,500 check to UAB on August 24, 1999. The accompanying\n\nletter simply asked UAB to credit the payment to Wilson’s son’s account and gave\n\nno other instructions. Although PUGH had made charitable contributions to\n\nschools and colleges, including UAB, it had never previously awarded a\n\nscholarship to an individual student. Grady Pugh thought the money would go\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\ftoward “books and tuition” but could not remember exactly what Wilson had said\n\nto him.\n\n          Grady Pugh was unaware that FWDE had already paid Wilson’s son’s\n\ntuition and fees for the 1999-2000 school year.29 UAB applied PUGH’s\n\nscholarship money to Wilson’s son’s account in four quarterly installments of\n\n$1,125 per installment, as was its standard practice for scholarships when a donor\n\ndid not instruct otherwise. UAB took about one third of the PUGH money to cover\n\nthe son’s housing and other fees, and disbursed the remainder of the PUGH money\n\ndirectly to the son each quarter. The installments were disbursed to the son in\n\nSeptember 1999, December 1999, March 2000, and June 2000. Wilson’s son\n\nsigned a receipt each time. Grady Pugh testified that he never did anything after\n\nAugust 1999 to follow up on the “scholarship” and he did not know that UAB\n\nwould defer full payment into the following year. The government did not present\n\nany evidence that Wilson was aware of UAB’s payment arrangements.\n\n       Grady Pugh explained his intent in giving the scholarship to Wilson’s son:\n\n       When you offer somebody something like that . . . you expect them to\n       help you if they can. And when I did that for [Wilson], I felt like if he\n       got a chance to help us, he would.\n\nGrady Pugh explained that giving things of value to County employees provided\n\n\n       29\n         The government did not allege there was anything improper about the FWDE\nscholarship.\n\n                                            44\n\fPUGH with the “general benefit” of “hav[ing] preferential treatment and, you\n\nknow, if we had problems it would help resolve the problems. Numerous ways\n\nthat things could be made easier.”\n\nC.     Jury’s Verdicts\n\n       The jury convicted defendants Wilson and PUGH on Count 75 and\n\ndefendant Wilson on Count 76. Wilson has not appealed. PUGH appeals as to\n\nCount 75.30\n\n                          V. THE BARBER TRIAL (05-542)\n\n       In the Barber trial, held from January 8 to 17, 2007, defendants Barber,\n\nPUGH, Roland Pugh, and Yessick were charged with conspiring to bribe Barber\n\nby, among other things, PUGH’s paying and Barber’s accepting $47,927 in real\n\nproperty and nearly $1,200 in trips to casinos and beaches (Count 78). Defendants\n\nPUGH and Roland Pugh were also charged with bribing Barber by giving him that\n\n$47,927 property (Count 83), and defendant PUGH was charged with paying for\n\nthese trips (Counts 84-86).31\n\n       Defendants Barber and Yessick pled guilty to Count 78. Only PUGH and\n\n\n\n       30\n         Count 77 charged PUGH with the substantive offense of bribing Wilson with the\nscholarship, but was dismissed before trial on the government’s motion.\n       31\n        The trips were to Isle of Capri Casino, Vicksburg, Mississippi ($148), Beau Rivage\nResort & Casino, Biloxi, Mississippi ($546), and Phoenix III Condominiums, Gulf Shores,\nAlabama ($481).\n\n                                              45\n\fRoland Pugh went to trial. The government called 7 witnesses, including\n\nChandler, Grady Pugh, and Yessick. The defense called 7 witnesses, including\n\nBarber.\n\nA.    Barber Helps PUGH\n\n      Barber supervised the JCESD’s twenty-six job-site County inspectors.\n\nBarber was responsible for hiring sewer contractors to do no-bid emergency work,\n\napproving contractors’ paperwork, and certifying their expenses before sending the\n\nexpenses to JCESD Assistant Director Chandler.\n\n      In January 2000, Barber determined the sewer pipes in the Paradise Lake\n\nsubdivision should be replaced on an emergency basis instead of being repaired.\n\nOn January 7, Barber told City Inspector Hodges that Barber had chosen a\n\ncontractor who could do the job in about 45 days. PUGH’s President Yessick sent\n\nBarber a letter, dated January 27, 2000, offering that PUGH could do the job for\n\nabout $1.2 million. That same day, Yessick also sent Hodges a letter, dated\n\nJanuary 27, 2000, stating that PUGH would be performing the job. Given that\n\nemergency work contracts were limited to $50,000 or less, PUGH eventually\n\nreceived a no-bid field directive in the amount of $857,000, on which PUGH made\n\na 50% profit. However, because Barber had classified the work as an emergency,\n\nthere was no contract for Paradise Lake on which to put the field directive. The\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\femergency work contract therefore was placed on the unrelated multi-million-\n\ndollar Cahaba River project.\n\nB.    Bribes of Barber\n\n      Beginning in 1997 and continuing through 2001, PUGH’s President Yessick\n\ncaused PUGH to pay to send Barber on an annual beach resort or casino vacation\n\nin locations including Orange Beach, Alabama and Biloxi and Vicksburg,\n\nMississippi. PUGH paid $148 for Barber’s stay in Vicksburg, $546 for his stay in\n\nBiloxi, and $481 for his stay at the Phoenix III Condominiums in Orange Beach,\n\nAlabama. PUGH recorded the payments for the trips to Orange Beach and Biloxi\n\nin PUGH’s books as sewer “rehab” projects.\n\n      In the spring of 2000, Barber asked PUGH’s Yessick if he would find and\n\npurchase a piece of property in McCalla, Alabama on which Barber could retire.\n\nYessick consulted a realtor for this purpose, visited several properties himself, and,\n\nin November 2000, signed a contract to purchase land in the name of “Roland\n\nPugh” for $47,500. The next week, Yessick gave the realtor a check for $1,000,\n\nsigned by PUGH’s CFO Lorelei Heglas. In anticipation of the cost PUGH would\n\nincur for the land purchase, Yessick instructed PUGH CFO Heglas to charge\n\n$45,000 to the Paradise Lake project.\n\n      However, days before closing, Roland Pugh’s administrative assistant Janice\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fKuykendall told Yessick that PUGH no longer intended to buy the land in PUGH’s\n\nname but instead planned to give Barber a cashier’s check to buy the land in his\n\nown name. PUGH assistant Kuykendall told Yessick to travel to Tuscaloosa to get\n\nthe check and then take back from the realtor all documents referring to PUGH.\n\n      PUGH’s Yessick got the check, which was made out to the settlement\n\nattorney for $46,877, and on which the “NAME OF REMITTER” line was left\n\nblank. Yessick then gave Barber the check. Barber closed on the land contract in\n\nhis own name on December 18, 2000. Yessick also gave Barber a cashier’s check\n\nfor $1,050 to replace the check he gave to the realtor. The realtor prepared papers\n\nto refund PUGH’s deposit.\n\n      In September 2002, a newspaper article revealed an investigation into PUGH\n\nand Barber. Six months later, over a seven-week period, Barber sent PUGH a\n\nseries of checks amounting to $46,877. Yet Barber paid no interest, and there was\n\nno evidence of any document indicating a loan.\n\n      At trial Yessick testified that he paid the charged bribes in the hope that\n\nBarber, who supervised the JCESD’s job-site inspectors, would assist if PUGH\n\nwere to have a problem with an inspector being “irrational.” Counsel for PUGH\n\nand Roland Pugh argued that they did not provide things to Barber with the intent\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fto influence him.32 The government presented 404(b) evidence showing that\n\nPUGH’s Yessick paid for Chandler to go on a fishing vacation, that Grady Pugh\n\nbought a carpet for McNair, that Grady Pugh made cash payments to McNair, and\n\nthat PUGH worked on McNair’s home in Arkansas.\n\nC.     Jury’s Verdicts\n\n       The jury convicted PUGH on Counts 78 (bribery conspiracy), 83 ($47,927\n\nin real property), and 84-86 (trips). Roland Pugh was acquitted on Counts 78 and\n\n83, the only counts against him in the Barber trial. PUGH appeals all conviction\n\ncounts.\n\n                              VI. QUID PRO QUO ISSUES\n\n       All defendant-appellants argue that their bribery convictions under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 66633 must be vacated because the Indictment failed to allege, and the\n\ngovernment failed to prove, the contractor-defendants gave specific benefits to\n\nCounty employees in exchange for, and with the intent that, the employees perform\n\n\n\n\n       32\n          Defendant Roland Pugh called Barber to testify that he (Barber) never met Roland Pugh\nuntil after the relevant time period and that Barber did not have an intent to be influenced by the\ntrips that PUGH bought for him.\n       33\n         The defendant-appellants’ § 666 convictions are: (1) McNair, Counts 1-3, 5-12, 32; (2)\nSwann, Counts 51-54, 57, 58, 60; (3) PUGH, Counts 1, 15, 51, 61-63, 71, 75, 78, 83-86; (4)\nRoland Pugh, Count 1; (5) RAST, Counts 1, 19-24, 51, 66, 67, 72, 87; (6) Bobby Rast, Counts 1,\n19-22, 51, 66, 67, 72, 87; (7) Danny Rast, Counts 1, 19, 20, 22; (8) FWDE, Counts 1, 28, 51, 69;\nand (9) Dougherty, Counts 1, 28, 51, 69.\n\n                                                49\n\fa specific official act, termed a quid pro quo.34 The defendant-appellants also\n\nargue the district court erred, at a minimum, by refusing to charge the jury that the\n\ngovernment must prove a specific quid pro quo. We begin by reviewing the\n\nrelevant parts of § 666.35\n\nA.     18 U.S.C. § 666\n\n       Section 666 proscribes theft and bribery in connection with programs of\n\nlocal governments receiving federal funds.36 Section 666(a)(1)(B) criminalizes a\n\nlocal government employee’s “corruptly” soliciting or accepting a bribe:\n\n       (a) Whoever . . .\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          Black’s Law Dictionary defines quid pro quo as follows: “An action or thing that is\nexchanged for another action or thing of more or less equal value; a substitute.” Black’s Law\nDictionary 1367 (9th ed. 2009). Defendants argue the government must prove a specific or\nidentifiable thing of value was exchanged for a specific or identifiable official act.\n       35\n          The interpretation of a statute is a question of law we review de novo. United States v.\nSearcy, 418 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v. Mazarky, 499 F.3d 1246, 1248\n(11th Cir. 2007). Whether an indictment is sufficient is also a question of law reviewed de novo.\nUnited States v. Steele, 178 F.3d 1230, 1233 (11th Cir. 1999). “An indictment is sufficient if it:\n(1) presents the essential elements of the charged offense, (2) notifies the accused of the charges\nto be defended against, and (3) enables the accused to rely upon a judgment under the indictment\nas a bar against double jeopardy for any subsequent prosecution for the same offense.” Id. at\n1233-34 (quotation marks omitted).\n       36\n         A predicate to a § 666 offense is that the defendant must be an agent of an\n“organization, government, or agency [that] receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess\nof $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee,\ninsurance, or other form of Federal assistance.” 18 U.S.C. § 666(b). It is undisputed that\nJefferson County received the requisite amount of federal funds and that McNair, Swann,\nWilson, Barber, Chandler, Ellis, and Creel were employees and thus agents of Jefferson County.\n\n                                                50\n\f             (1) being an agent[37 ] of [a] local . . . government, or any agency\n             thereof--\n             ....\n                  (B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person,\n                  or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any\n                  person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection\n                  with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such\n                  . . . government, or agency involving anything of value of\n                  $5,000 or more; or\n\n       shall be fined . . . , imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(B). Defendants McNair, Swann, Wilson, and Barber, as\n\nJefferson County employees, violated § 666(a)(1)(B) if: (1) they solicited or\n\naccepted anything of value; (2) with the corrupt intent to be influenced or\n\nrewarded; (3) in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions\n\nof Jefferson County involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.38 Id. The\n\n       37\n          As to “agent,” the district court in the McNair trial charged the jury: “The term ‘agent’\nmeans a person authorized to act on behalf of a local government and includes an employee,\nofficer, manager or representative of a local government. Jefferson County, Alabama is a local\ngovernment of Alabama.” In the Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, the district court charged the\njury: “The term ‘agent’ as relevant to this case means any employee, officer, director, manager\nor representative of a local government. Jefferson County, Alabama, is a local government of\nAlabama.”\n       38\n            The $5,000 in § 666(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2) refers to the value of the “business, transaction,\nor series of transactions,” not the value of the bribe. See United States v. Zimmermann, 509\nF.3d 920, 927 (8th Cir. 2007) (concluding a benefit of more than $5,000 received for less than\n$5,000 in bribes was sufficient for a § 666(a)(1)(B) conviction); see also Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 57, 118 S. Ct. 469, 473 (1997) (“Subject to the $5,000 threshold for the\nbusiness or transaction in question, the statute forbids acceptance of a bribe by a covered official\n. . . .”); United States v. Castro, 89 F.3d 1443, 1454 (11th Cir. 1996) (describing in dicta the\n$5,000 element in § 666(a)(2) as “in connection with any business transaction [sic] or series of\ntransactions”); but see United States v. Abbey, 560 F.3d 513, 521 (6th Cir.) (stating in dicta that\n“§ 666 contains . . . a requirement that the illegal gift or bribe be worth over $5,000”), cert.\ndenied, 130 S. Ct. 739 (2009). Where the bribe-giver receives an intangible benefit, some courts\n\n                                                  51\n\fcounts in the Indictment as to McNair and Swann track the language of the statute.\n\n       Section 666(a)(2) also criminalizes “corruptly” offering or giving a bribe to\n\na local government employee:\n\n       (a) Whoever . . .\n            ....\n            (2) corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything of value to\n            any person, with intent to influence or reward an agent of [a] . . .\n            local . . . government, or any agency thereof, in connection with any\n            business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization,\n            government, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or\n            more;\n\n       shall be fined . . . , imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\n\nId. § 666(a)(2). The contractor-defendants — PUGH, Roland Pugh, RAST, Bobby\n\nRast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty — violated § 666(a)(2) if: (1) they gave\n\nto a County employee anything of value; (2) with the corrupt intent to influence or\n\nreward them; (3) in connection with any business, transaction, or series of\n\ntransactions of Jefferson County involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\n\nId. The counts in the Indictment as to these contractor-defendants also track the\n\nlanguage of § 666(a)(2).\n\n\n\nhave used the bribe amount as a proxy to stand for the value of the business or transaction. See\nUnited States v. Marmolejo, 89 F.3d 1185, 1194 (5th Cir. 1996) (using, under § 666(a)(1)(B), the\nmore than $5,000 paid to sheriff to determine the value of conjugal visits received by prisoner);\nUnited States v. Fernandes, 272 F.3d 938, 944 (7th Cir. 2001) (using the value of bribes to\nprosecutor, under § 666(a)(1)(B), where prosecutor received bribes in exchange for his\nexpunging the bribe-givers’ DUI convictions). Here, the parties do not dispute that the $5,000\nlevel was met.\n\n                                               52\n\f      It is well established in this Circuit that an indictment is sufficient if it tracks\n\nthe language of the statute and provides a statement of facts that gives notice of the\n\noffense to the accused. See United States v. Jordan, 582 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th\n\nCir. 2009); United States v. Walker, 490 F.3d 1282, 1296 (11th Cir. 2007); United\n\nStates v. Sharpe, 438 F.3d 1257, 1263 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Ndiaye,\n\n434 F.3d 1270, 1299 (11th Cir. 2006). By listing the items of value received or\n\ngiven by the defendants, each count of the Indictment provides sufficient facts and\n\ncircumstances to give adequate notice of the charges to be defended against. Thus,\n\nwe readily determine the Indictment itself was not defective for failure to allege a\n\nspecific quid pro quo.\n\nB.    Paradies and US Infrastructure Decisions\n\n      Nonetheless, this does not resolve whether the language in § 666(a)(1)(B) or\n\n(a)(2) effectively requires the government to prove a specific quid pro quo to\n\nobtain a § 666 conviction. This question has been before this Court twice before\n\nbut only under plain error review, and even then, we did not squarely answer it.\n\nSee United States v. US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1212-14; United States v.\n\nParadies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1289 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n      In Paradies, the defendant claimed that the district court erred in failing to\n\ncharge the jury that a quid pro quo was an element required to convict under § 666\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\fId. at 1289. This Court did not decide if quid pro quo was an element but\n\nconcluded there was no reversible jury charge error because the jury charge tracked\n\nthe statutory language of § 666 and the defendant did not object to the charge. Id.\n\n      The Paradies Court also rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. Id. The Paradies Court stated: “the evidence at trial was sufficient for a\n\njury to find that Jackson [the official] accepted payments for his votes and his\n\ninfluence upon the City Council and the administration,” and “[s]uch a finding\n\nwould satisfy any quid pro quo requirement under the statute.” Id. In other words,\n\nParadies concluded that even if § 666 requires a quid pro quo, that requirement is\n\nsatisfied by showing a series of payments intended generally to influence the\n\nofficial’s decisions.\n\n      Subsequently, our United States v. US Infrastructure decision involved an\n\nappeal from the fifth trial (the USI trial, 05-543) that arose out of the Indictment\n\nhere. US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1202-03. The defendants in US Infrastructure\n\nargued the jury charges on the § 666 counts were erroneous because they did not\n\ninclude their proposed instruction that the jury must find a specific quid pro quo to\n\nconvict under § 666. Id. at 1213. This Court concluded that the district court “did\n\nnot commit plain error by refusing [defendants’] quid pro quo [jury] instruction.”\n\nId. at 1214. As its sole basis for this conclusion, US Infrastructure stated this\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\fCourt had already rejected this argument in two prior cases: “This Court has\n\nrejected the argument that the government must ‘show a direct quid pro quo\n\nrelationship between [the defendants] and an agent of the agency receiving federal\n\nfunds.’” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1214 (quoting United States v. Castro, 89\n\nF.3d 1443, 1454 (11th Cir. 1996), and citing Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1289). However,\n\nas shown above, Paradies did not actually make a holding to that effect. Neither\n\ndid United States v. Castro.39 Nonetheless, US Infrastructure itself holds a specific\n\nquid pro quo is not required for a § 666 conviction. Because US Infrastructure was\n\nonly plain error review, we now make the same holding but under de novo review.\n\n       We begin with the statutory language itself.40 Importantly, § 666(a)(1)(B)\n\nand (a)(2) do not contain the Latin phrase quid pro quo. Nor do those sections\n\n\n       39\n          In Castro, the issue was whether § 666(a)(2) required that the bribe-givers intended to\nenter into a direct exchange with an agent of an entity receiving the federal funds, or if it was\nsufficient that they offered the bribe to a third-person middleman with the intent to influence that\nagent by having that middleman authorize that agent to issue payments to the defendants.\nCastro, 89 F.3d at 1453-54. The Castro Court concluded that “influence” under § 666 could be\nexercised indirectly and that it was sufficient that the defendants intended to influence the agent\nby causing a middleman to authorize the agent to issue payments. Id. Although in reaching this\nconclusion the Castro Court stated, “[w]e reject appellants’ suggestion that the government had\nto show a direct quid pro quo relationship between [the defendants] and an agent of the agency\nreceiving federal funds,” id., Castro was addressing whether there was a “directness”\nrequirement between the bribe-giver and the agent and did not answer the question before us\nhere.\n       40\n         “When construing a criminal statute, [this Court] begin[s] with the plain language;\nwhere ‘the language Congress chose to express its intent is clear and unambiguous, that is as far\nas we go to ascertain its intent because we must presume that Congress said what it meant and\nmeant what it said.’” United States v. Browne, 505 F.3d 1229, 1250 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting\nUnited States v. Steele, 147 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc)).\n\n                                                 55\n\fcontain language such as “in exchange for an official act” or “in return for an\n\nofficial act.” In short, nothing in the plain language of § 666(a)(1)(B) nor\n\n§ 666(a)(2) requires that a specific payment be solicited, received, or given in\n\nexchange for a specific official act. To accept the defendants’ argument would\n\npermit a person to pay a significant sum to a County employee intending the\n\npayment to produce a future, as yet unidentified favor without violating § 666.\n\n       The requirement of a “corrupt” intent in § 666 does narrow the conduct that\n\nviolates § 666 but does not impose a specific quid pro quo requirement. In all the\n\ntrials consolidated in this appeal, the district court’s jury charge, with slight\n\nvariations, defined “corruptly” as follows: “An act is done ‘corruptly’ if it is\n\nperformed voluntarily, deliberately and dishonestly for the purpose of either\n\naccomplishing an unlawful end or result or of accomplishing some otherwise\n\nlawful end or lawful result by an[y] unlawful method or means.” It is acting\n\n“corruptly” — dishonestly seeking an illegal goal or a legal goal illegally — that\n\nseparates permissible from criminal. The addition of a corrupt mens rea avoids\n\nprosecution for acceptable business practices.41\n\n\n       41\n          We do not read the definitional language of “corrupt” to impose a quid pro quo\nrequirement. In any event, the district court charged that definition. It also has been suggested\nthat § 666’s language — a thing of value given with corrupt intent to influence — effectively\nconstitutes a quid pro quo in that the payment is made for influence. This at best would be\n“quid pro quo light.” Even if one views § 666 this way, the district court charged the language\nof the § 666 statute.\n\n                                                56\n\f       For all of these reasons, we now expressly hold there is no requirement in\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(B) or (a)(2) that the government allege or prove an intent that a\n\nspecific payment was solicited, received, or given in exchange for a specific\n\nofficial act, termed a quid pro quo.\n\n       As to the defendant County employees, the government must show only\n\nwhat § 666(a)(1)(B) says: that a County employee “corruptly” accepted “anything\n\nof value” with the intent “to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any\n\nbusiness, transaction, or series of transactions” of the County. And as to the\n\ncontractor-defendants, the government must show only what § 666(a)(2) says: that\n\nthe defendant “corruptly” gave “anything of value” to a County employee with the\n\nintent “to influence or reward” that person “in connection with any business,\n\ntransaction, or series of transactions” of the County.\n\n       To be sure, many § 666 bribery cases will involve an identifiable and\n\nparticularized official act, but that is not required to convict. Simply put, the\n\ngovernment is not required to tie or directly link a benefit or payment to a specific\n\nofficial act by that County employee. The intent that must be proven is an intent to\n\ncorruptly influence or to be influenced “in connection with any business” or\n\n“transaction,” not an intent to engage in any specific quid pro quo.42\n\n\n       42\n        The defendant-appellants rely on United States v. Siegelman, 561 F.3d 1215 (11th Cir.\n2009), petition for cert. filed, 78 U.S.L.W. 3083 (U.S. Aug. 10, 2009) (No. 09-167), 78\n\n                                              57\n\fC.     Other Circuits\n\n       In concluding § 666 does not require a specific quid pro quo, we align\n\nourselves with the Sixth and Seventh Circuits. See United States v. Abbey, 560\n\nF.3d 513, 520 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 739 (2009) (stating “the text says\n\nnothing of a quid pro quo requirement to sustain a conviction” and “while a quid\n\npro quo of money for a specific legislative act is sufficient to violate\n\n[§ 666(a)(1)(B) or (a)(2)], it is not necessary”) (quotation marks omitted); United\n\nStates v. Gee, 432 F.3d 713, 714-15 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that “[a] quid pro quo\n\nof money for a specific legislative act” is not necessary under § 666(a)(1)(B) and\n\nthat an exchange of money for the official’s “influence” was enough); United\n\nStates v. Agostino, 132 F.3d 1183, 1190 (7th Cir. 1997) (“We decline to import an\n\n\n\n\nU.S.L.W. 3090 (U.S. Aug. 10, 2009) (No. 09-182), and United States v. Massey, 89 F.3d 1433\n(11th Cir. 1996), but neither case answers the question here. In Siegelman, the district court\ngave a quid pro quo instruction in response to the defendant’s request. The district court\ninstructed the jury that they could not convict unless “the defendant and official agree that the\nofficial will take specific action in exchange for the thing of value.” Siegelman, 56 F.3d at 1225.\nThis Court stated “[s]o, whether or not a quid pro quo instruction was legally required, such an\ninstruction was given,” and “[t]herefore assuming a quid pro quo instruction was required in this\ncase, we find no reversible error.” Id. at 1225, 1227.\n        In Massey, “[t]he jury convicted [attorney] Massey of one count of bribery in violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(2) finding that Massey purchased [Judge] Sepe’s lunches at Buccione in\nexchange for court appointments.” Massey, 89 F.3d at 1439. This Court rejected Massey’s\nclaim that the government was required to produce direct evidence of a verbal or written\nagreement to this effect and stated “inferences drawn from relevant and competent\ncircumstantial evidence” were sufficient. Id. (quotation marks omitted). The quid pro quo issue\nhere was not raised or discussed in Massey. The fact that the evidence of a specific exchange\nwas sufficient to sustain the § 666(a)(2) bribery conviction in Massey does not mean one is\nrequired to obtain a § 666(a)(2) conviction here.\n\n                                                58\n\fadditional, specific quid pro quo requirement into the elements of § 666(a)(2).”);\n\nbut see United States v. Jennings, 160 F.3d 1006, 1014 (4th Cir. 1998) (concluding\n\nthe “corrupt intent” element in § 666 requires the government to prove a quid pro\n\nquo, but stating the “quid pro quo requirement is satisfied so long as the evidence\n\nshows a ‘course of conduct of favors and gifts flowing to a public official in\n\nexchange for a pattern of official actions favorable to the donor’” and “the intended\n\nexchange in bribery can be ‘this for these’ or ‘these for these,’ not just ‘this for\n\nthat’” (citations omitted)).\n\n       The Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ganim, 510 F.3d 134 (2d\n\nCir. 2007), also supports our analysis to some extent.43 The defendant “Ganim’s\n\nchallenges to the jury charge primarily relate[d] to a single issue: namely, whether\n\nproof of a government official’s promise to perform a future, but unspecified,\n\nofficial act is sufficient to demonstrate the requisite quid pro quo for a conviction”\n\nunder § 666(a)(1)(B). Id. at 141-42. Although accepting a quid pro quo\n\nrequirement for a bribery conviction, the Second Circuit rejected Ganim’s claim\n\n\n       43\n          The defendant in Ganim was convicted of these “bribery-related crimes”: “(1) extortion\nin violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; (2) ‘honest services mail fraud’ in violation of\n18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 & 1346; (3) federal programs bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(b)\n[sic]; and (4) bribe receiving in violation of Connecticut General Statutes section 53a-148\n(collectively, the ‘bribery-related crimes’).” Ganim, 510 F.3d at 141. The Ganim opinion first\nanalyzed the quid pro quo issue collectively as to the bribery-related crimes. Id. at 141-42. It\nlater discussed the jury charges under an “Extortion” subheading, but much of that discussion\nrelated to all bribery-related crimes in the case. Id. at 142-47. Because Ganim discussed the\nbribery-related crimes collectively, it did not focus on the language of § 666(a)(1)(B).\n\n                                               59\n\fthat “a direct link must exist between a benefit received and a specifically\n\nidentified official act.” Id. at 142. The Second Circuit held “that the requisite quid\n\npro quo for the crimes at issue [which included § 666(a)(1)(B)] may be satisfied\n\nupon a showing that a government official received a benefit in exchange for his\n\npromise to perform official acts or to perform such acts as the opportunities arise.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Second Circuit added that “so long as the jury finds that\n\nan official accepted gifts in exchange for a promise to perform official acts for the\n\ngiver, it need not find that the specific act to be performed was identified at the\n\ntime of the promise, nor need it link each specific benefit to a single official act.”\n\nId. at 147.\n\n       The Second Circuit also explained that “requiring a jury to find a quid pro\n\nquo . . . ensures that a particular payment is made in exchange for a commitment to\n\nperform official acts to benefit the payor in the future,” and “[o]nce the quid pro\n\nquo has been established, however, the specific transactions comprising the illegal\n\nscheme need not match up this for that.” Id. at 147. The Second Circuit’s analysis\n\nlies somewhere beyond a no-quid pro quo requirement, as adopted by the Sixth,\n\nSeventh, and now the Eleventh Circuits, and the Fourth Circuit’s requirement.\n\nWhile the Second Circuit requires a quid pro quo, that requirement is satisfied by a\n\nquid (thing of value) in exchange for a promise to perform an unidentified, official\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\fact at some point in the future. Id. at 142-47. In other words, in the Second Circuit\n\nthe quo need not be specific or even identifiable at the time of the quid, and to that\n\nextent the Second Circuit arguably supports our conclusion. And to some extent,\n\nconfusion reigns in this area because courts often use the term quid pro quo to\n\ndescribe an exchange other than a particular item of value for a particular action.\n\nD.    Sun-Diamond and § 201\n\n      Because there is no support for the defendant-appellants’ quid pro quo\n\nargument in the text of § 666, they rely on how the Supreme Court interpreted a\n\ndifferent criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, in United States v. Sun-Diamond\n\nGrowers of California, 526 U.S. 398, 119 S. Ct. 1402 (1999). However, Sun-\n\nDiamond does not address § 666, and there are significant differences in the text of\n\nthe two statutes (§§ 201 and 666).\n\n      The defendant Sun-Diamond was a trade association convicted of providing\n\n“illegal gratuities” under 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(1)(A) for having given tickets, meals,\n\nand other items to the federal Secretary of Agriculture. Id. at 401, 119 S. Ct. at\n\n1404-05. Section 201(c)’s illegal gratuity provision prohibited Sun-Diamond\n\nfrom: “giv[ing] . . . anything of value to any public official . . . for or because of\n\nany official act performed or to be performed by such public official . . . .” 18\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\fU.S.C. § 201(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).44 In Sun-Diamond, the district court\n\ncharged the jury it could convict if it found “Sun-Diamond provided [the\n\nSecretary] with unauthorized compensation simply because he held public office,”\n\nand that “[t]he government need not prove that the alleged gratuity was linked to a\n\nspecific or identifiable act or any act at all.” Id. at 403, 119 S. Ct. at 1405\n\n(emphasis added). The “point in controversy” was that the jury instructions\n\nsuggested that an illegal gratuity “did not require any connection between\n\n[defendant’s] intent and a specific official act.” Id. at 405, 119 S. Ct. at 1406.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond concluded that § 201(c) did require a\n\nlink between the gratuity and a specific “official act” because the statutory text\n\nprohibited gratuities given or received “for or because of any official act performed\n\nor to be performed” and then defined “official act” as “any decision or action on\n\nany question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy . . . .” Id. at 406, 119\n\nS. Ct. at 1407 (quoting § 201(c)(1)(A) and (a)(3)). And it was specifically this text\n\nof the illegal gratuity statute — “for or because of any official act” — that the\n\nSupreme Court in Sun-Diamond found to be “pregnant with the requirement that\n\nsome particular official act be identified and proved.” Id. at 406, 119 S. Ct. at\n\n1407 (emphasis added). In stark contrast, none of these phrases are used in\n\n\n\n      44\n           There is no threshold monetary requirement in §§ 201(b) or 201(c)(1)(A).\n\n                                                62\n\f§§ 666(a)(1)(B) or 666(a)(2).\n\n       We recognize that the Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond also distinguished\n\nbetween a § 201(b) bribery crime and a § 201(c) illegal gratuity crime. Id. at 404-\n\n05, 119 S. Ct. at 1406. The Supreme Court pointed out that bribery in § 201(b)\n\n“requires a showing that something of value was corruptly given, offered, or\n\npromised to a public official (as to the giver) or corruptly demanded, sought,\n\nreceived, accepted, or agreed to be received or accepted by a public official (as to\n\nthe recipient) with intent, inter alia, ‘to influence any official act’ (giver) or in\n\nreturn for ‘being influenced in the performance of any official act’ (recipient).” Id.\n\nat 404, 119 S. Ct. at 1406 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)). The Supreme Court\n\nexplained that “[t]he distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element.” Id.\n\nat 404, 119 S. Ct. at 1406. The Supreme Court explained further that in § 201:\n\n       Bribery requires intent “to influence” an official act or “to be influenced”\n       in an official act, while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be\n       given or accepted “for or because of” an official act. In other words, for\n       bribery there must be a quid pro quo – a specific intent to give or receive\n       something of value in exchange for an official act. An illegal gratuity,\n       on the other hand, may constitute merely a reward for some future act\n       that the public official will take (and may already have determined to\n       take), or for a past act that he has already taken.\n\nId. at 404-05, 119 S. Ct. at 1406 (emphasis added).45 The Supreme Court also\n\n\n       45\n         A bribe under § 201(b) is punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment, while the lesser\ncrime of illegal gratuity under § 201(c) is punishable by up to 2 years’ imprisonment. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b), (c).\n\n                                               63\n\fstated: “The District Court’s instructions in this case, in differentiating between a\n\nbribe and an illegal gratuity, correctly noted that only a bribe requires proof of a\n\nquid pro quo.” Id. at 405, 119 S. Ct. at 1406.\n\n      Although § 201(b) requires that a bribe be given or received to influence an\n\n“official act” or “in return for” an “official act,” § 666 sweeps more broadly than\n\neither § 201(b) or (c). Section 666 requires only that money be given with intent to\n\ninfluence or reward a government agent “in connection with any business,\n\ntransaction, or series of transactions.” 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(B) & (a)(2). Section\n\n666 does not say “official act” but says “any business, transaction, or series of\n\ntransactions.” Id. Section 666 does not say “in return for” or “because of” but says\n\n“in connection with.” Id.\n\n      More importantly, the Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond was concerned with\n\naccidentally criminalizing legal gratuities under § 201(c), such as giving a ball cap,\n\na sports jersey, or token gift to the Secretary of Agriculture “based on his official\n\nposition and not linked to an identifiable act.” Id. at 406-07, 119 S. Ct. at 1407;\n\nsee Ganim, 510 F.3d at 146 (“Undergirding the [Supreme] Court’s decision in Sun-\n\nDiamond was a need to distinguish legal gratuities (given to curry favor of an\n\nofficial’s position) from illegal gratuities (given because of a specific act).”). That\n\nconcern is diminished here because § 666 contains a corrupt intent requirement. In\n\n\n\n                                           64\n\fany event, as reasoned by the Second Circuit, “there is good reason to limit\n\nSun-Diamond’s holding to the statute at issue in that case, as it was the very text of\n\nthe illegal gratuity statute — ‘for or because of any official act’ — that led the\n\nCourt to its conclusion that a direct nexus was required to sustain a conviction\n\nunder § 201(c)(1)(A).” Ganim, 510 F.3d at 146. “Nor is there any principled\n\nreason to extend Sun-Diamond’s holding beyond the illegal gratuity context.” Id.\n\nE.    Rule of Lenity\n\n      We also reject defendant-appellants’ argument that the rule of lenity requires\n\nus to read a specific quid pro quo requirement into § 666. The rule of lenity may\n\napply in a number of different circumstances. For example, “[t]he rule of lenity is\n\napplied when a broad construction of a criminal statute would ‘criminalize a broad\n\nrange of apparently innocent conduct.’” United States v. Svete, 556 F.3d 1157,\n\n1169 (11th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (quoting Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419,\n\n426, 105 S. Ct. 2084, 2088 (1985)), cert. denied, __ S. Ct. __, 78 U.S.L.W. 3546\n\n(U.S. Mar. 22, 2010) (No. 09-7576). However, “[t]he simple existence of some\n\nstatutory ambiguity . . . is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most\n\nstatutes are ambiguous to some degree.” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S.\n\n125, 138, 118 S. Ct. 1911, 1919 (1998). The mere possibility of a narrower\n\nstatutory construction by itself does not make the rule of lenity applicable. Svete,\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\f556 F.3d at 1169. Application of the rule requires a “grievous ambiguity.”\n\nMuscarello, 524 U.S. at 138-39, 118 S. Ct. at 1919 (“The rule of lenity applies only\n\nif, ‘after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,’ . . . we can make ‘no\n\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.’”) (citation omitted).\n\n      The rule of lenity does not apply here because defendant-appellants fail to\n\nidentify a “grievous ambiguity” in § 666(a)(1)(B) or (a)(2), or to show that the\n\nstatutory language criminalizes innocent behavior. Section 666(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2)\n\ncriminalize only those acts done “corruptly,” and, indeed, § 666 provides a defense\n\nfor “bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or\n\nreimbursed, in the usual course of business.” 18 U.S.C. § 666(c).\n\nF.    Defendants’ Proposed Jury Charges\n\n      In the McNair, Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, all defendant-appellants\n\nrequested jury charges that included a quid pro quo requirement.46\n\n      46\n        For example, in the McNair trial, PUGH requested this instruction:\n      In order for you to find defendant [PUGH] guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable\n      doubt that [PUGH] gave something of value to Defendant McNair with the specific\n      intent of obtaining a quid pro quo, that is, that [PUGH] gave the item of value with\n      the specific intent to improperly cause Defendant McNair to commit a specific act\n      in favor of [PUGH], or with the specific intent of illegally rewarding Defendant\n      McNair for having previously committed such an act. In other words, the United\n      States must show that [PUGH] provided the item of value either (1) with the\n      expectation that Defendant McNair would improperly provide something specific in\n      return or (2) for the purpose of rewarding McNair for something improper that\n      Defendant McNair had previously done.\n      In the Swann trial, Bobby Rast, for example, requested this instruction:\n      [Y]ou must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Bobby Rast gave something of value\n      to Defendant Swann with the specific corrupt intent of obtaining a quid pro quo, that\n\n                                               66\n\f      In the McNair trial, the district court rejected the proposed quid pro quo\n\ninstructions, gave the Eleventh Circuit’s pattern jury instructions for § 666 as to\n\ncorruptly giving bribes, telling the jury:\n\n      As I’ve said, the defendants, other than Jewell C. “Chris” McNair, are\n      charged in various counts of violating a portion of Title 18, Section 666,\n      which makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to corruptly give,\n      offer or agree to give anything of value to anyone who is an agent of a\n      local government receiving significant benefits under a federal assistance\n      program intending to reward or influence that agent in connection with\n      any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such local\n      government involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\n      ....\n      Fifth: And this is another thing that the government would have to prove\n      beyond a reasonable doubt.\n      That each such gift, offer or agreement to give, that by each of those\n      gifts, offer or agreement to give, the Defendant [] corruptly intended to\n      reward or influence Jewell C. “Chris” McNair in connection with a\n      transaction, or series of transactions, with Jefferson County, Alabama,\n      which transaction or series of transactions involved something of value\n      of $5,000 or more.\n      Sixth: That in doing so, the Defendant [] acted corruptly.\n      An act is done “corruptly” if it is performed voluntarily, deliberately, and\n      dishonestly, for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or\n      result or of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by\n\n\n\n\n      is, that Bobby Rast gave the item of value with the specific corrupt intent to\n      improperly influence Defendant Swann to commit a specific official act in favor of\n      Bobby Rast, or with the specific corrupt intent of illegally rewarding Defendant\n      Swann for having previously committed such an act. In other words, the United\n      States must show that Bobby Rast corruptly provided the item of value either (1)\n      with the expectation that Defendant Swann would improperly provide some official\n      specific act or acts in return or (2) for the purpose of rewarding Jack W. Swann for\n      some specific improper official act or acts that Defendant Swann had previously\n      done.\n\n                                              67\n\f       an unlawful method or means.47\n\nThe district court also gave the pattern § 666 jury charge, with slight variations, as\n\nto corruptly receiving bribes. The judges in the subsequent trials (Swann,48\n\nBarber,49 and Wilson50 ) agreed with the district\n\n\n       47\n          See Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) at 180-81 (Offense\nInstruction 24) (2003). The district court instructed the jury the government must prove all\nelements of a § 666 crime, such as that McNair had to be an agent and the County had to receive\nover $10,000 in federal funds. We quote in the text only the part of the pattern charge about the\ncorrupt intent element.\n       48\n         In the Swann trial, the district court instructed the jury as to corruptly accepting bribes:\n       As to [the § 666 substantive bribery] counts the defendant Jack W. Swann can be\n       found guilty of [§ 666 bribery] only if all the following facts are proved beyond a\n       reasonable doubt.\n       ....\n       The fifth element which is common to all of those counts as the first four were, that\n       . . . by such acceptance or agreements, the defendant Jack W. Swann intended as to\n       the count under consideration to be influenced or rewarded in connection with a\n       transaction or series of transactions of Jefferson County, Alabama which transactions\n       or series of transactions involve something of value of $5,000 or more.\n       And six, that in so doing the defendant Jack W. Swann acted corruptly.\n       An act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily and deliberately and\n       dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result or of\n       accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by any unlawful method\n       or means.\nThe court gave a similar pattern § 666 jury charge as to corruptly giving bribes.\n       49\n         In the Barber trial, the district court instructed the jury as to only PUGH’s corruptly\ngiving bribes because Barber, the acceptor, pled guilty:\n       The defendant Roland Pugh Construction, Inc., can be found guilty of the offense\n       charging a violation of [§ 666(a)(2)] only if all the following facts are proved beyond\n       a reasonable doubt:\n       ....\n       Fifth, that by giving, offering, or agreeing to give things of value to Clarence R.\n       Barber, defendant Roland Pugh Construction, Inc., intended to influence or reward\n       Clarence R. Barber in connection with any business transaction or series of\n       transactions which involve something of $5,000 or more.\n       And, sixth, that in doing so, the defendant Roland Pugh Construction, Inc., acted\n       corruptly.\n\n                                                  68\n\fcourt’s ruling in the McNair trial and gave jury instructions that did not include\n\ndefendant-appellants’ requested quid pro quo instructions.51\n\n       Given our conclusion that § 666(a)(1)(B) and (2) do not require proof of a\n\nspecific quid pro quo, defendant-appellants’ proposed jury instructions containing\n\nthat requirement were incorrect statements of law. Thus, the district courts did not\n\n\n       ....\n       An act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily, deliberately, and\n       dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result, or\n       of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or result by any unlawful method or\n       means.\n       50\n         Because in the Wilson case only PUGH appeals, we quote the “corruptly giving” part of\nthe court’s jury charge:\n       The purpose of the plan alleged by the government in the indictment was also for the\n       defendant, Pugh Incorporated, through Grady R. Pugh, Jr., to corruptly give, offer,\n       and agree to give things of value to defendant Ronald K. Wilson with the intent of\n       influencing and rewarding him for supporting their interests in connection with the\n       J.C.E.S.D. sewer rehabilitation construction program in violation of [18 U.S.C.\n       § 666(a)(2)].\n       ....\n       Title 18 of the United States Code section 666(a)(2) makes it a federal crime or\n       offense for any person to corruptly give, offer, or agree to give anything of value to\n       any person with the intent to influence or reward an agent of a local government or\n       local governmental agency receiving significant benefits under a federal assistance\n       program, in connection with any business, transaction or series of transactions of\n       such local government or government agency involving anything of value of $5,000\n       or more.\n       ....\n       An act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily, deliberately, and\n       dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result or\n       of accomplishing some otherwise lawful result by any unlawful method or means.\n       51\n          “In considering the failure of a district court to give a requested instruction, the\nomission is error only if the requested instruction is correct, not adequately covered by the\ncharge given, and involves a point so important that failure to give the instruction seriously\nimpaired the party’s ability to present an effective case.” Svete, 556 F.3d at 1161 (quotation\nmarks omitted). The district court’s refusal to give a requested instruction is reviewed for abuse\nof discretion. Id.\n\n                                                69\n\fabuse their discretion in refusing them. See US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1213\n\n(determining omission of a specific quid pro quo requirement in § 666 jury\n\ninstruction was not plain error); Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1289 (same).\n\n       In the McNair trial, all defendant-appellants also requested that the jury be\n\ninstructed that if a thing of value was given out of friendship or merely to foster\n\ngoodwill and not to corruptly influence or reward, then a not-guilty verdict is\n\nrequired. After that request, the district court in the McNair trial supplemented the\n\npattern instructions with this:\n\n       Section 666 . . . does not prohibit all gifts by or to a public official, does\n       not prohibit all receipts -- does not prohibit receipt of all gifts by or to a\n       public official, but only gifts received with the corrupt intent to be\n       influenced or rewarded by that governmental official in connection with\n       a business or transaction or series of transactions of that governmental\n       entity involving $5,000 or more.[52]\n\nAfter the defendant-appellants insisted the district court specifically identify\n\nfriendship and goodwill gifts as legal gratuities, the court responded “if it’s corrupt\n\nand dishonest, it’s not for good will, is it?” The district court explained that giving\n\ndefendant-appellants’ instruction would “carr[y] with it some sort of suggestion\n\n\n\n       52\n         In the Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, PUGH also requested the same jury charge.\nThe Rast and Pugh defendants either requested this jury instruction or adopted PUGH’s request,\nin the Swann trial. And in the Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, the district court gave similar\nsupplemental jury charges expressly advising the jury that § 666 does not prohibit all gifts to a\npublic official, but only those gifts with the corrupt intent to influence or reward specified\ngovernment officials in connection with the business or transaction or series of transactions of\nthat governmental entity.\n\n                                                70\n\fthat I’m adopting that idea that that’s what these payments were.” This exchange\n\nthen took place:\n\n       THE COURT:                                    What if it’s good will and corrupt?\n       [ROLAND PUGH’S COUNSEL]:                      It can’t be.\n       THE COURT:                                    Okay. That’s your answer.\n\nA finding that a gift was made or accepted with corrupt intent necessarily excludes\n\nfriendship and goodwill gifts. There is no reversible error in the court’s charge in\n\nthis regard.53\n\n                      VII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nA.     Conspiracy and Corrupt Intent\n\n       All defendant-appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support\n\ntheir convictions on various counts.54 Defendants’ primary arguments are the\n\ngovernment failed to prove a conspiracy among the defendants (as to Counts 1, 51,\n\n\n\n\n       53\n         We also find no merit to defendant-appellants’ claims on appeal as to any other\nproposed jury instructions because they were either incorrect, too argumentative or flawed in\nsome way, not necessary, or already adequately covered by the court’s charge as a whole. In\nparticular, we conclude the court’s charge adequately covered defendants’ theory of defense that\nthe payments were gifts made out of friendship or to foster good will and adequately charged the\njury on the honest services mail fraud counts (90-100) as discussed later.\n       54\n          “This Circuit reviews the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, examining the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the government and resolving all reasonable inferences and\ncredibility issues in favor of the guilty verdicts.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1203. We “will\nnot overturn a conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence unless no rational trier of fact\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States\nv. Wright, 392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                71\n\f75, and 78) or any corrupt intent as to all the bribery counts.55\n\n       To sustain the conspiracy convictions, the government must prove (1) “the\n\nexistence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful objective, here, giving things of\n\nvalue” to County employees with the corrupt intent to influence or reward them;\n\n(2) “the defendant[s’] knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy;” and\n\n(3) “an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at\n\n1203; see also United States v. Jennings, 599 F.3d 1241, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\nDefendants argue the government failed to present any evidence of an agreement\n\namong them.\n\n       The problem for defendants is direct evidence of an agreement is\n\nunnecessary; the existence of the agreement and a defendant’s participation in the\n\nconspiracy may be proven entirely from circumstantial evidence. Id.; United\n\nStates v. Massey, 89 F.3d 1433, 1439 (11th Cir. 1996). “A defendant may be\n\nfound guilty of conspiracy if the evidence demonstrates he knew the ‘essential\n\nobjective’ of the conspiracy, even if he did not know all its details or played only a\n\n\n\n       55\n         Defendants PUGH, Roland Pugh, Yessick, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE,\nand Dougherty were convicted on Count 1 for participating in a conspiracy to bribe defendant\nMcNair. Defendants PUGH, Yessick, RAST, Bobby Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty were\nconvicted on Count 51 of participating in a conspiracy to bribe defendant Swann. Defendants\nPUGH and Wilson were convicted on Count 75 of participating in a conspiracy (between PUGH,\nGrady Pugh, and Wilson) to bribe Wilson. Defendant PUGH was convicted on Count 78 of\nparticipating in a conspiracy (between PUGH, Roland Pugh, Barber, and Yessick) to bribe\nBarber.\n\n                                             72\n\fminor role in the overall scheme.” United States v. Guerra, 293 F.3d 1279, 1285\n\n(11th Cir. 2002). The government need not show “each defendant had direct\n\ncontact with each of the other alleged co-conspirators.” Id. “It is not necessary for\n\nthe government to prove that a defendant knew every detail or that he participated\n\nin every stage of the conspiracy.” United States v. Jones, 913 F.2d 1552, 1557\n\n(11th Cir. 1990). “For a wheel conspiracy to exist those people who form the\n\nwheel’s spokes must have been aware of each other and must do something in\n\nfurtherance of some single, illegal enterprise.” United States v. Fernandez, 892\n\nF.2d 976, 986 (11th Cir. 1989) (quotation marks omitted). “[A] common purpose\n\nor plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.”\n\nUS Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1205 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Extensive witness and documentary evidence firmly established that the\n\nthings of value described in the conviction counts were given by the contractor-\n\ndefendants and accepted by McNair, Swann, Barber, Wilson, and other County\n\nemployees. The defendants in the McNair and Swann trials mainly dispute\n\nwhether the government proved they acted (1) with corrupt intent (versus for\n\nfriendship), and (2) in agreement (versus independently). The government\n\npresented more than sufficient evidence of both corrupt intent and a conspiracy\n\nagreement.\n\n\n\n                                          73\n\f      First, ample evidence showed that the contractor-defendants worked together\n\non McNair’s studio and Swann’s home and that they did so with a common\n\npurpose of providing sizable benefits to influence McNair and Swann in the\n\nbillion-dollar sewer rehabilitation program. There was no evidence of gifts to\n\nthese “friends” before the sewer projects began. Instead, the gifts to McNair and\n\nSwann and other County employees were made during the same time period of the\n\nsewer projects. The large sums — both in bribes and sewer payments — indicate a\n\ncommon scheme of all defendant-appellants to receive County sewer money\n\nthrough illegal means. The jury was free to disbelieve the defendants’ claims of\n\ngifts for friendship and to find corrupt intent to influence McNair and Swann in\n\nconnection with the County’s massive sewer payments to the contractor-\n\ndefendants. The juries could readily believe the gifts worth hundreds of thousands\n\nof dollars to McNair and Swann after the sewer work began were actually bribes\n\nintended to make sure the contractors profited excessively from the work. In fact,\n\nthe evidence recounted above showed pervasive and entrenched corruption.\n\n      Second, the evidence of how the contractor-defendants divided up and\n\ncoordinated their work on the same personal projects for McNair (his studio) and\n\nSwann (his home) during the same time frame is strong evidence of a conspiracy.\n\nFor example, FWDE’s Bailey supervised the construction of McNair’s studio\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\fwhile PUGH and RAST provided labor and materials. RAST furnished the labor\n\nto build the deck, and PUGH furnished the materials. RAST excavated for the\n\nfootings, and PUGH ordered the concrete and poured concrete walls. FWDE paid\n\nMosley Construction for the wood framing initially, and then RAST began paying\n\nMosley. FWDE ordered the aluminum handrails, PUGH paid for them, and RAST\n\ninstalled them. The same pattern of dividing up the work was followed for the\n\nSwann home. For example, an FWDE employee supervised the work at Swann’s\n\nhome. PUGH’s Yessick hired a company to install a koi pond for Swann, and\n\nPUGH listed Danny Rast as a point of contact.56\n\n       Third, the extent to which the parties went to conceal their bribes is powerful\n\nevidence of their corrupt intent. For example, evidence in the McNair trial showed\n\nFWDE employed Bailey as a full-time construction superintendent for the McNair\n\nstudio renovation and reported Bailey’s time as purportedly performed on a JCESD\n\nsewer project. FWDE concealed a $50,000 payment Dougherty made to\n\nsubcontractor George Word Construction for building McNair’s Arkansas\n\nretirement home.57 FWDE has no record of the transaction at all. The only\n\n\n\n       56\n        In addition, after McNair’s retirement, PUGH, FWDE, and Bobby Rast each gave\nMcNair a check for the same amount — $5,000 — all within a two-day period.\n       57\n         Earlier, PUGH had paid Word $44,192.75 in the first half of October 2001, and, per\nYessick’s instruction, internally charged the expense to miscellaneous jobs/construction\nmaterials. McNair told George Word that FWDE would make the next payment.\n\n                                              75\n\fexisting record of this transaction was made by a bookkeeper, who copied the\n\ninvoice and check and kept them at home because of his suspicions. FWDE also\n\nsupplied a construction superintendent, Hendon, for Swann’s home remodel. For\n\nnearly two years, Hendon was on FWDE’s payroll but actually spent half of every\n\nworkday at Swann’s home. FWDE’s Stanger replaced Hendon for an additional\n\nnine months. Dougherty was aware of this work at Swann’s home. FWDE paid a\n\nsubcontractor over $28,000 — with checks signed by Dougherty — to frame the\n\naddition to Swann’s home.\n\n      Likewise, RAST paid nearly $77,000 for materials and subcontractors for\n\nMcNair’s studio. RAST also supplied significant amounts of labor for McNair’s\n\nstudio, including excavating for the footings and constructing its deck and metal\n\nsteps. RAST hid these expenses by coding them to JCESD projects.\n\n      After a newspaper article revealed RAST’s work on Swann’s home, Bobby\n\nRast told his bookkeeper that they “didn’t need any document invoices in the files\n\nwith Jack Swann’s or Chris McNair’s shipping address on them,” causing her to\n\ndiscard these invoices. Before the article, RAST had treated its payments to\n\nMcNair and Swann as business expenses, deducting them on its tax returns. After\n\nthe article, RAST amended several years’ returns to eliminate more than $140,000\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\fof those deductions.58\n\n       Similarly, RAST crews performed demolition work and poured concrete for\n\nthe basement, walls, stairs, and elevator pit at Swann’s home. RAST also spent\n\nmore than $28,000 purchasing concrete and bricks and paying subcontractors to\n\nrepair the plumbing, paint Swann’s home, and install hardwood floors and stairs.\n\nAs with McNair, RAST concealed its work for Swann, in particular avoiding the\n\nuse of Swann’s name on invoices, delivery tickets, and accounting reports, and\n\ncoding the work and expenses either to miscellaneous or JCESD projects.\n\n       PUGH also concealed its work on McNair’s studio. For example, when\n\nBesco delivered steel to McNair’s studio, Besco’s delivery tickets identified PUGH\n\nand Yessick as its customer and indicated that some of the steel was for the Valley\n\nCreek Treatment Plant, a JCESD sewer job on which PUGH was the contractor\n\nand FWDE the consulting engineer.\n\n       Defendants claim they could not have intended to corruptly influence\n\nMcNair because his authority was purely “ministerial,” since he only ratified what\n\nJCESD officials below him (such as Swann) had already approved. Given\n\n\n\n\n       58\n          Sufficient evidence also supports the Rast defendants’ convictions for bribing Chandler\nand Ellis. First, Chandler asked Bobby Rast for money to attend technical conferences that Ellis\nwas also planning to attend. Instead of giving Chandler a check for $250-$500 as Chandler\nexpected, Bobby Rast gave Chandler an envelope containing $5,000 cash and told Chandler to\nsplit it with Ellis.\n\n                                               77\n\fMcNair’s ultimate authority and responsibility, a jury could infer McNair became a\n\n“rubber-stamp” for the defendants’ pay requests, field directives, and contract\n\nmodifications that crossed his desk because of the large sums in goods and services\n\nhe received from the contractor-defendants. And because he was responsible for\n\nplacing sewer items on the County Commission’s weekly agenda, McNair\n\ncontrolled every sewer matter requiring Commission approval.59\n\nB.     PUGH’s Challenges to Counts 75 and 78\n\n       PUGH challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to its bribery conspiracy\n\nconvictions on Count 75 (the Wilson scholarship) and Count 78 (land and\n\nvacations for Barber). However, ample evidence supports both convictions.\n\n       The evidence established that when Grady Pugh gave Wilson’s son the\n\nscholarship, he expected Wilson to return the favor. Grady Pugh testified that\n\nwhen he provided the Wilson scholarship, he “felt like if [Wilson] got a chance to\n\n\n\n\n       59\n          Defendants also contend the government failed to prove any specific payment (or work\non McNair’s studio or Swann’s home) was given or done in exchange for a specific official act\nby McNair or Swann. Because a specific quid pro quo is not an element of a § 666(a)(1)(B) or\n(a)(2) crime, there was necessarily no failure of proof as to that element.\n        Alternatively, even assuming these § 666 crimes require, as the Second Circuit concluded\nin Ganim, that the government prove payments or such work were given or done in return for a\npromise of as yet unidentified future conduct favorable to the contractor-defendants in their\nCounty sewer projects, the evidence overwhelmingly established such facts and thus any error in\nthe jury charge was harmless. And even under the Fourth Circuit’s approach in Jennings, which\nrequires a “course of conduct of favors and gifts flowing to a public official in exchange for a\npattern of official actions favorable to the donor,” the evidence here was sufficient, and thus any\njury charge error was harmless. Jennings, 160 F.3d at 1014.\n\n                                                78\n\fhelp us and return the favor, he would.” Only three days after Wilson faxed Grady\n\nPugh information as to where PUGH should send the scholarship check — and the\n\nday before Grady Pugh sent it — Wilson approved PUGH’s request for a time\n\nextension that had been sitting on Wilson’s desk for four weeks. When PUGH\n\nsubmitted its extension request, PUGH was already exposed to liability of $76,000\n\nin liquidated damages. The amount of exposure exceeded $100,000 by the time\n\nWilson actually granted PUGH’s request.\n\n      The evidence also supports the verdict that PUGH and Yessick conspired to\n\nbribe Barber. Barber oversaw all of the JCESD inspectors and awarded the no-bid\n\nemergency work contracts. In 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001, PUGH paid for\n\nBarber’s vacations, but hid the payments in the company’s books. PUGH readily\n\nagreed to Barber’s June 2000 request to buy him a lot for a retirement home.\n\nPUGH’s Yessick contracted for the lot in Roland Pugh’s name but charged\n\n$45,000 to the Paradise Lake project to pay for it. Then, just before the closing,\n\nPUGH instead gave Barber a cashier’s check to buy the lot in his own name. The\n\nremitter’s name was left blank on that check. Yessick was told to retrieve all\n\nevidence that PUGH was ever involved. This required the realtor to fabricate a\n\nfictitious house sale to refund the original $1,000 deposit.\n\n      Moreover, just months before Barber solicited PUGH for the purchase of the\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\flot, Barber designated the Paradise Lake project as an emergency. Because the\n\ncost of the project — $827,417.75 — greatly exceeded Barber’s $50,000\n\nemergency work approval limit, and because there was no Paradise Lake contract\n\non which to grant a field directive, the work was performed as a field directive on\n\nthe unrelated multimillion dollar Cahaba River project. PUGH netted a profit of\n\nmore than $400,000.\n\n      PUGH argues the Wilson scholarship and Barber land transaction are not\n\nbribery conspiracies, but merely “buyer-seller” transactions. PUGH relies\n\nprimarily on two drug cases, United States v. Mercer, 165 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th\n\nCir. 1999) (cash for drugs), and United States v. Dekle, 165 F.3d 826, 830-31 (11th\n\nCir. 1999) (sex for drugs), for the proposition that there is no conspiracy where\n\nthere is merely a “buy-sell transaction” without an “agreement to join together to\n\naccomplish a criminal objective beyond that already being accomplished by the\n\ntransaction.” Mercer, 165 F.3d at 1335 (quotation marks omitted). PUGH argues\n\nthat there was nothing agreed upon with Wilson or Barber outside of the one gift or\n\none buy-sell transaction. The drug cases of Mercer and Dekle are materially\n\ndifferent from § 666 bribery conspiracy cases. In a drug deal, once the sale is\n\ncomplete, there is no further criminal objective. In § 666 cases, once the gift is\n\nmade, the defendant typically intends to corruptly influence the County employee’s\n\n\n\n                                          80\n\ffuture actions. See United States v. Tilton, 610 F.2d 302, 307 (5th Cir. 1980)60\n\n(bribee conspired with briber in part because of common goal of increasing their\n\npersonal wealth). In § 666 cases, the defendants share both an anticipation of\n\nfuture action and a common goal of increasing their wealth illegally.61\n\nC.     Swann and PUGH’s Challenges to Counts 90-100\n\n       In the Swann trial, Swann, PUGH, and Yessick were convicted of eleven\n\ncounts (90-100) of honest services mail fraud under §§ 1341 and 1346. The\n\nconvictions involve Swann’s receiving landscaping services worth $140,000 from\n\nPUGH and Yessick. On appeal, Swann and PUGH claim the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to support their convictions.62\n\n       To establish a violation of § 1341, the government must show the defendant\n\n“(1) intentionally participates in a scheme or artifice to defraud another of money\n\nor property, and (2) uses or ‘causes’ the use of the mails . . . for the purpose of\n\nexecuting the scheme or artifice.” United States v. Ward, 486 F.3d 1212, 1222\n\n\n       60\n       This Court adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions prior to October 1,\n1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc).\n       61\n         To the extent defendant-appellants make sufficiency of the evidence arguments as to\nany other § 666 conviction counts, we reject them as without merit.\n       62\n          Yessick does not appeal. On appeal, Swann and PUGH do not challenge the\nconstitutionality of the honest services statute. Instead, Swann raises two claims: (1)\ninsufficient evidence to sustain his §§ 1341, 1346 convictions, and (2) the district court erred by\nrefusing to give a “good faith” instruction to the jury. PUGH adopted Swann’s claim of\ninsufficient evidence.\n\n                                                 81\n\f(11th Cir. 2007).63\n\n       Section 1346 adds “honest services” language to the § 1341 offense,\n\nproviding that “the term ‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or\n\nartifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1346. “To prove ‘honest services’ mail fraud, the Government must show that\n\nthe accused intentionally participated in a scheme or artifice to deprive the persons\n\nor entity to which the defendant owed a fiduciary duty of the intangible right of\n\nhonest services, and used the United States mails to carry out that scheme or\n\nartifice.” United States v. Browne, 505 F.3d 1229, 1265 (11th Cir. 2007). When a\n\npublic official “secretly makes his decision based on his own personal interests —\n\nas when an official accepts a bribe or personally benefits from an undisclosed\n\nconflict of interest — the official has defrauded the public of his honest services.”\n\nUnited States v. Lopez-Lukis, 102 F.3d 1164, 1169 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\n       Here, Swann received approximately $100,000 in landscaping and lawn\n\n\n       63\n         Section 1341 provides in pertinent part:\n       Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\n       . . . places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or\n       thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to\n       be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or\n       commercial interstate carrier, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or\n       thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the\n       direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person\n       to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or\n       imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n18 U.S.C. § 1341.\n\n                                                  82\n\fmaintenance from a company (PUGH) that he had the power to favor in the sewer\n\nrehabilitation program. In the summer of 2000, after Swann told PUGH’s Yessick\n\nhe had overspent in remodeling his house, Yessick hired Guthrie Landscaping to\n\nlandscape Swann’s two properties. By December 2001, PUGH had paid Guthrie\n\nmore than $93,000, including $1,200 per month in 2001 for lawn maintenance. In\n\nJanuary 2002, Yessick asked Guthrie to stop submitting invoices to PUGH and\n\ninstead advanced Guthrie $47,000 for three years of landscaping and maintenance.\n\nPUGH paid a total of approximately $140,000 to Guthrie for landscaping work for\n\nthe Swanns.64\n\n       Although Swann contends there was “no bribe” and none of this was “done\n\nin secrecy,” the evidence shows PUGH and Swann took steps to conceal any\n\nrecord of the services provided to Swann. Guthrie mailed its invoices to PUGH\n\nand, at Yessick’s request, identified the work by job number only. Yessick\n\ndirected PUGH’s controller to charge the expense to the Metro Park Roadway, a\n\nCounty job. Guthrie’s invoices were never found in PUGH’s files.\n\n       After Swann and Yessick learned of the investigation, Guthrie was abruptly\n\nasked to stop working at Swann’s home, even though there was a balance\n\n\n\n       64\n        In addition to the substantive bribery counts against Swann (Count 52) and PUGH\n(Count 61) for these landscaping services, both defendants were convicted of separate counts\n(Counts 90-100) of honest services mail fraud for payments PUGH made by mail to Guthrie.\n\n                                               83\n\fremaining on its $47,000 advance. In August and September 2002, approximately\n\ntwo years after hiring Guthrie, Yessick directed his assistant to create invoices to\n\nSwann’s mother and mother-in-law for landscaping, tree removal, and “remodeling\n\nwork.” The Swanns then took out home equity loans in the names of their\n\nmothers, and wrote two checks to PUGH totaling approximately $59,000 on joint\n\naccounts they held with their mothers. Yessick gave these checks directly to\n\nPUGH’s controller, telling her they were partial payment for $105,000 in\n\nlandscaping work PUGH had done, which work he had previously directed her to\n\nrecord as “miscellaneous AR.” Yessick told the controller to credit the $59,000 in\n\nchecks to PUGH as “miscellaneous income” and “to write off” the approximately\n\n$46,000 that remained.\n\n      Swann contends that PUGH merely located the landscaping contractor and\n\nthat he always intended to reimburse PUGH for payments to Guthrie. However,\n\nPUGH and Swann concealed the landscaping arrangement. The concealment itself\n\nis strong evidence that Swann accepted these services not as a loan, but as a bribe.\n\nSee United States v. Hunt, 521 F.3d 636, 646-47 (6th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129\n\nS. Ct. 2157 (2009); United States v. Dial, 757 F.2d 163, 170 (7th Cir. 1985).\n\n      Swann also claims he was unable to, and did not, assist PUGH in any way.\n\nYet, five days after PUGH’s President Yessick hired Guthrie to landscape Swann’s\n\n\n\n                                          84\n\ftwo properties, Swann granted a 180-day extension for PUGH’s joint venture on\n\nthe Vestavia Trunk project. That extension saved PUGH’s joint venture $180,000\n\nin potential liquidated damages. Two months earlier, Swann had denied a 120-day\n\nextension request on the same project, noting that timely completion of the project\n\nwas “a requirement of the specifications.” And in 2000, Swann approved a\n\n$827,417.75 field directive for PUGH’s Paradise Lake project and caused it to be\n\ncharged to the unrelated Cahaba River project. As noted earlier, Barber had\n\ndesignated the project as an emergency, and then Swann later approved this field\n\ndirective.\n\n       The evidence fully supports the jury’s guilty verdict on Counts 90-100 as to\n\nSwann and PUGH.65\n\nD.     Roland Pugh’s Arguments\n\n       Roland Pugh challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his\n\nconviction for conspiracy to commit bribery of McNair (Count 1). Roland Pugh\n\n\n\n       65\n          Swann also claims the district court erred by refusing his proposed jury instruction that\ngood faith is a complete defense to mail fraud. The district court instructed the jury that to\nconvict, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants “knowingly devised or\nparticipated in a scheme to fraudulently deprive the public of an intangible right of honest\nservices” and did so willfully with intent to defraud. The court defined “intent to defraud” as “to\nact knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive someone.” Because a finding of specific\nintent to defraud necessarily excludes a finding of good faith, Swann’s requested instruction was\n“substantially covered by other instructions that were delivered,” and Swann has shown no error\nin the refusal to give his requested good faith charge. United States v. Opdahl, 930 F.2d 1530,\n1533 (11th Cir. 1991) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                85\n\falso argues the government failed to prove a “wheel” or “hub and spoke”\n\nconspiracy because there was no evidence he knew the Rast and Dougherty\n\ndefendants (the other “spokes”) were bribing McNair (the “hub”).\n\n      This ignores the fact that Roland Pugh directed Grady Pugh to fly McNair’s\n\ndaughter and FWDE’s superintendent Bill Bailey (who was overseeing\n\nconstruction at McNair’s studio) on the PUGH company airplane to Georgia to\n\npick out carpet for McNair’s studio. Before take-off, Roland Pugh told Grady\n\nPugh that “McNair has called now and says that he’s broke and he doesn’t have\n\nenough money to leave for the deposit on the carpet. So, if you would, write a\n\ncheck for the deposit.” Grady Pugh paid the deposit with a $4,820 PUGH check\n\nand had it treated on the company’s books as an expense on the “last rehab\n\ncontract.”66\n\n      Roland Pugh also gave McNair money in connection with the project to\n\ndevelop McNair’s studio. When the project began, Roland Pugh told PUGH’s\n\nother three owners, Grady Pugh, Andy Pugh, and Yessick, that they had to give\n\nmoney to McNair because he was building a studio and, as ten percent owners,\n\nthey had to “kick in” their ten percent. Grady Pugh gave approximately $1,500 in\n\n\n\n\n      66\n           Grady Pugh’s testimony in this regard was corroborated by Bill Bailey’s testimony.\n\n                                                 86\n\fcash to Roland Pugh’s secretary that time to give to McNair.67\n\n       On another occasion, Roland Pugh collected money from the three other\n\nPUGH owners to give to McNair for his studio. On July 18 and 19, 2000, three of\n\nthem wrote checks to cash in proportion to their ownership interests. (Roland\n\nPugh: $7,000, Andy Pugh: $1,000, Yessick: $1,000). Roland Pugh gave Grady\n\nPugh an envelope of money and asked him to give it to McNair. Grady Pugh took\n\nit to McNair’s studio where he saw FWDE’s Bailey and told Bailey he (Grady\n\nPugh) was there to help McNair, and that it was “financial help” that McNair\n\nneeded at that time. Grady Pugh then visited with McNair for a few minutes and\n\nset the envelope down between the seats of the van they were in as McNair\n\nwatched. After McNair retired, Roland Pugh complained to Grady Pugh about\n\nMcNair’s demand for help building a retirement home, saying that “surely this is\n\nthe last time we’ll have to do anything for him since he’s out of office.”68\n\n\n       67\n          We reject Roland Pugh’s claim that his conspiracy conviction falls outside of the statute\nof limitations because no member of the “Pugh spoke” committed an overt act after August 26,\n2000. The Rast and Dougherty defendants took actions in furtherance of the conspiracy well\nwithin the statute of limitations. “[A]n individual conspirator need not participate in the overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy. Once a conspiracy is established, and an individual is\nlinked to that conspiracy, an overt act committed by any conspirator is sufficient.” United States\nv. Thomas, 8 F.3d 1552, 1560 n.21 (11th Cir. 1993). Because Roland Pugh had joined the\nconspiracy to bribe McNair and because that conspiracy continued into the statute of limitations\nperiod, Roland Pugh’s conviction stands even if he took no actions within that period. The\ndistrict court properly instructed the jury that it could convict Roland Pugh if any co-conspirator\ncommitted an act after August 26, 2000.\n       68\n         Roland Pugh cites the drug case of United States v. Mercer, 165 F.3d at 1335-36, for\nthe proposition that there is no conspiracy where there is merely a “buy-sell transaction.” As\n\n                                                87\n\f       Later, after McNair asked Roland Pugh to pay for the studio’s $40,000 air\n\nconditioning system, Roland Pugh gathered funds by writing checks to his\n\ndaughters-in-law and to cash. Once again, Grady Pugh delivered an envelope of\n\ncash to McNair, this time at his house.\n\n       As a result, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict Roland Pugh\n\nand to find that he was aware of at least some of the other co-conspirators, such as\n\nFWDE and FWDE’s Bailey, given that they were working on separate parts of a\n\nlarger project. Accordingly, we reject Roland Pugh’s sufficiency of the evidence\n\nchallenge to his conviction on Count 1.\n\n       The cases Roland Pugh relies on are inapposite. In United States v.\n\nChandler, 388 F.3d 796, 807-08 (11th Cir. 2004), the “hub” of the conspiracy\n\nensured “there was no connection whatsoever between the various spokes,” and the\n\nspokes “knew nothing about each other.” The evidence here shows that Roland\n\nPugh was aware not only of PUGH, Yessick, and Grady Pugh’s involvement in the\n\nMcNair project, but also that of the Dougherty and Rast defendants’ involvement.\n\nFor the same reason, United States v. Glinton, 154 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir. 1998), is\n\nnot on point. Id. at 1251 n.5 (concluding “hub and spoke” conspiracy must have\n\n\nexplained earlier, Mercer is materially different from § 666 bribery conspiracy cases. In any\nevent, Roland Pugh’s argument lacks merit as to Count 1 because there is ample evidence that\npersons other than Roland Pugh and McNair were involved in the transactions in the bribery\nconspiracy.\n\n                                               88\n\f“some interaction between those conspirators who form the spokes of the wheel as\n\nto at least one common illegal object”) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nE.     McNair’s Arguments Regarding Dawson\n\n       The evidence at the McNair trial showed McNair’s conviction for accepting\n\na bribe from Dawson is adequately supported. Dawson’s firm received millions of\n\ndollars in no-bid engineering contracts from McNair, and the vast majority of\n\nDawson’s work was on JCESD contracts. McNair solicited the studio’s $16,400\n\naudio-video system from Dawson. Dawson “was uncomfortable with the whole\n\nsituation” and would not have agreed if McNair was not part of the sewer\n\nrehabilitation process, so he had the store conceal the delivery address on the\n\ninvoice.\n\n                                  VIII. 404(B) EVIDENCE\n\n       All defendant-appellants challenge the admission of other bad acts evidence\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).69 Specifically, they contend the district\n\ncourts erred by admitting, for example, Swann-bribe evidence in the McNair trial\n\nand McNair-bribe evidence in the Swann trial.\n\n\n\n\n       69\n          A district court’s evidentiary rulings under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) are\nreviewed only for “a clear abuse of discretion.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1208. “[T]his\nCourt ‘will not hold that the district court abused its discretion where it reached the correct result\neven if it did so for the wrong reason.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Samaniego, 345 F.3d 1280,\n1283 (11th Cir. 2003)).\n\n                                                  89\n\f      Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:\n\n      Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the\n      character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\n      It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of\n      motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\n      absence of mistake or accident . . . .\n\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b). This Court uses a three-part test to determine whether other\n\nbad acts are admissible under Rule 404(b):\n\n      First, the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant's\n      character; Second, the act must be established by sufficient proof to\n      permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act;\n      Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially\n      outweighed by its undue prejudice . . . .\n\nUnited States v. Matthews, 431 F.3d 1296, 1310-11 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “[I]n every conspiracy case, a not guilty plea renders the\n\ndefendant’s intent a material issue. Evidence of such extrinsic evidence as may be\n\nprobative of a defendant’s state of mind is admissible unless the defendant\n\naffirmatively takes the issue of intent out of the case.” Id. at 1311 (alterations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Moreover, Rule 404(b) does not exclude evidence that is “inextricably\n\nintertwined” with evidence of the charged offense. United States v. Wright, 392\n\nF.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2004); United States v. Aleman, 592 F.2d 881, 885 (5th\n\nCir. 1979). Rule 404(b) does not exclude evidence that is “linked in time and\n\n\n\n                                           90\n\fcircumstances with the charged crime” or that “forms an integral and natural part\n\nof an account of the crime to complete the story of the crime for the jury.” Wright,\n\n392 F.3d at 1276 (quotations omitted); United States v. Edouard, 485 F.3d 1324,\n\n1344 (11th Cir. 2007).\n\n       We conclude the contested evidence was admissible for three reasons. First,\n\nthe evidence was inextricably intertwined with evidence of the charged bribery\n\noffenses. Second, even if not inextricably intertwined, this evidence was relevant\n\nto show corrupt intent and admissible under 404(b). Defendant-appellants\n\nexpressly argued they lacked corrupt intent and gave gifts to McNair and Swann\n\nout of friendship and good will.70 Evidence that the contractor-defendants gave\n\nthings of value to Swann in McNair’s trial and to McNair in Swann’s trial was\n\nhighly probative of the contractor-defendants’ intent. See Edouard, 485 F.3d at\n\n1345 (concluding extrinsic evidence is relevant “where the state of mind required\n\nfor the charged and extrinsic offenses is the same”). Moreover, evidence of similar\n\nconduct that occurs during the same time period has “heightened” probative value.\n\nJones, 913 F.2d at 1566. Indeed, the district court judge, in the McNair trial,\n\nexplained in a pre-trial order:\n\n\n\n       70\n         Roland Pugh does not stress lack of corrupt intent because he claims he was not\ninvolved at all in any gift. Other than Roland Pugh, defendants do not argue things of value\nwere not given by them to County officials, but they claim they were gifts, not bribes.\n\n                                               91\n\f       While the jury might conceivably find that the defendant felt such a\n       strong sense of friendship with McNair that they would give him\n       substantial gifts or make him substantial loans, the fact that they gave\n       alleged “gifts” or made “loans” to others involved with the same or\n       similar projects would certainly be relevant to the issues of “motive” and\n       “intent.” It could also bear on “plan” . . . [and i]f the projects are the\n       same or similar, they may well be a part of the same “series of\n       transactions.” . . . [W]hat might arguably be a “gift” to one person\n       becomes less likely a gift if the “gifts” are widespread to others involved\n       with the same or similar projects.[71]\n\nSimilarly in the Swann trial, another district court judge found that this sort of\n\nevidence of intent is “exactly what 404(b) testimony is here for.”\n\n       Third, the evidence was admissible under 404(b) to show the contractor-\n\ndefendants’ common plan and motive. Specifically, the evidence showed a\n\ncommon plan of bribing County officials controlling the sewer projects by\n\nproviding them with work on their personal homes or businesses and working\n\ntogether to do so during the same time frame of the sewer projects. For example,\n\nin the McNair trial, evidence showed — just as FWDE’s Bailey was supervising,\n\nand RAST and PUGH were providing labor and materials for the McNair studio\n\nexpansion — FWDE’s Stanger was supervising and using a RAST credit card to\n\npurchase materials for Swann’s separate home renovation. Similarly, in the Swann\n\ntrial, the evidence showed that RAST sent Luke Cobb to pour a concrete\n\n\n       71\n        The McNair judge stated in a subsequent order, “[t]he offenses were similar and\ntemporally close. The 404(b) evidence was clearly appropriate to meet the government’s\nrequirement to prove intent.”\n\n                                              92\n\ffoundation for McNair’s studio, just as he had done for the expansion of Swann’s\n\nhome, and that PUGH had provided Chandler with landscaping, just as it did for\n\nSwann. Indeed, the evidence recounted at length above gives repeated examples of\n\nhow the 404(b) evidence was relevant to show both corrupt intent and a common\n\nplan and motive.\n\n      Furthermore, the district courts in both the McNair and Swann trials gave\n\nlimiting instructions for the 404(b) evidence several times during the trials. See\n\nUnited States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, 981 F.2d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir. 1993) (concluding\n\nprejudice could be mitigated by giving a cautionary instruction on the limited use\n\nof such evidence). In the McNair trial, for example, after testimony of\n\nDougherty’s contributions to Swann’s remodeling, the court instructed in part:\n\n      This evidence is being allowed for the limited purpose, with respect to\n      Mr. Dougherty, as to what Mr. Dougherty’s intent may have been at the\n      time that he may have made payments, or contributions, or gifts, to Mr.\n      McNair. Not that Mr. McNair is charged with receiving anything in\n      connection with Mr. Swann’s house.\n\n      But the evidence is allowed for the purpose of your considering that if\n      Mr. Dougherty was making some sort of payments, or contributions, or\n      gifts, on behalf of Mr. McNair; and if he was also making some sort of\n      gifts, or payments, or contributions on behalf of Mr. Swann, you can\n      consider that combination with regard to your determination, which will\n      be a necessary determination for you to make, as to what Mr. Dougherty\n      and his company’s intent was, and the nature of that intent, whether it be\n      corrupt or otherwise, at the time he made gifts, or contributions, or\n      payments, on behalf of Mr. McNair.\n\n\n\n                                          93\n\fIn the Swann trial, the court gave similar limiting instructions several times.72\n\n       And the jury acquitted some defendants on some counts while convicting\n\nthem on others. This further demonstrates the jury was not confused and could\n\nsegregate the 404(b) evidence from other evidence. United States v. Prosperi, 201\n\nF.3d 1335, 1346 (11th Cir. 2000) (“A discriminating acquittal also can signal that\n\nthe jury was able to sift through the evidence properly.”); United States v. Coy, 19\n\nF.3d 629, 635 (11th Cir. 1994) (concluding that a split verdict demonstrates\n\n“absence of confusion” for 404(b) purposes).73\n\n       72\n          In the Barber and Wilson trials, the district courts admitted 404(b) evidence but gave\nsimilar limiting instructions several times.\n        For the first time on appeal, Swann contends that the limiting instructions were not\nspecific enough because they did not always identify by name the defendant against whom the\n404(b) evidence was not being offered. We review this issue for plain error. See infra section\nXII.D. Where, as here, the district court’s instructions accurately reflect the law, this Court\ngives “wide discretion as to the style and wording employed . . . .” United States v. Starke, 62\nF.3d 1374, 1380 (11th Cir. 1995). Moreover, at several times during trial, the district court\nspecifically offered to name defendants against whom the evidence was not offered, and\nappellants — including Swann — declined:\n        COURT:                          I have asked y’all that every single time we have\n                                        given a limiting instruction if you want me to use\n                                        specific names and I have been told no up to this\n                                        point. . . . I want you to know I am willing to sit here\n                                        and tell you the names. I think it would be\n                                        appropriate, but you are asking me not to; is that\n                                        right?\n        [SWANN’S COUNSEL]:              Yes, sir.\n Swann has not shown reversible error, plain or otherwise, in any of the jury instructions.\n       73\n         For example, in the Swann trial, the jury convicted Swann of bribery conspiracy, 6\nsubstantive bribery counts, and 11 fraud counts, but acquitted him of one bribery count and 17\nfraud counts. In the McNair trial, the jury convicted and acquitted different defendants on the\nsame charges. In McNair, the jury convicted McNair on Counts 1-3 and 5-12 but acquitted him\non Count 4. In both the McNair and Swann trials, the jury convicted Bobby Rast but acquitted\nDanny Rast on some of the same counts. In the Barber trial, the jury convicted PUGH but\n\n                                                94\n\f       Defendant-appellants’ claim that the 404(b) evidence should have been\n\nexcluded under Rule 403 lacks merit too. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 403,\n\nevidence must be excluded if its probative value “is substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice.” Wright, 392 F.3d at 1276. “Rule 403 is an\n\nextraordinary remedy that must be used sparingly because it results in the\n\nexclusion of concededly probative evidence.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at\n\n1211. This Court in US Infrastructure rejected defendant USI’s argument that\n\ncertain 404(b) evidence of a non-party’s bribes of McNair was inadmissible on\n\nRule 403 undue prejudice grounds, stating “in cases where this Court has found\n\nother acts evidence inextricably intertwined with the crimes charged, the Court has\n\nrefused to find that the evidence should nonetheless be excluded as unduly\n\nprejudicial . . . .” Id. “[T]he test under Rule 403 is whether the other acts evidence\n\nwas ‘dragged in by the heels’ solely for prejudicial impact.” Id. (quoting United\n\nStates v. Veltmann, 6 F.3d 1483, 1500 (11th Cir. 1993)). Because the other acts\n\nevidence was inextricably intertwined with the charged crimes, it was not\n\nexcludable under Rule 403. In any event, its probative value substantially\n\n\nacquitted Roland Pugh on the same counts.\n        Moreover, in the Swann and Wilson trials, the district court charged the jury to consider\neach defendant “separately and individually” and reminded them that “each defendant is on trial\nonly for the specific offenses or offense charged against such defendant in the indictment.” In\nthe McNair and Barber trials, the district court gave the same instruction with slight variations.\nSuch jury instructions substantially mitigate the risk of spillover prejudice. United States v.\nCross, 928 F.2d 1030, 1039 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                                95\n\foutweighed any undue prejudice.\n\n      Appellant McNair also points out that the government did not introduce any\n\nevidence that McNair knew about, condoned, arranged, or otherwise sanctioned\n\nany of the transactions constituting 404(b) bribe evidence against Swann.\n\nHowever, the Swann evidence was inextricably intertwined with the case against\n\nMcNair because sewer rehabilitation decisions went through two or three stages of\n\nreview in some situations, and thus the evidence showed the contractor-defendants\n\nwere giving things of value to County employees at every level of the JCESD.\n\nFor example, pay requests, contract modifications, and change orders were\n\nsometimes approved at the lower levels by the JCESD’s assistant director and\n\nengineers or by private engineers (like FWDE and Dougherty), and then, when\n\nnecessary, sent to Swann as the JCESD’s director — and then passed on to McNair\n\nfor approval or submission to the County Commission with McNair’s\n\nrecommendation. The bribery of other County employees shown in the McNair\n\nand Swann trials was an integral part of the overall bribery scheme because it\n\nshowed a common plan and motive of the contractor-defendants and completed the\n\nstory. The government amply showed linkage between contractor-defendants’\n\nbribes to McNair and those to Swann and other County employees and vice versa.\n\nWhile the USI trial considered in US Infrastructure involved 404(b) testimonial\n\n\n\n                                         96\n\fevidence by electrical contractor Henson, which is not at issue in this appeal, this\n\nCourt’s analysis in US Infrastructure is apt here: “Henson’s testimony was\n\nrelevant to the chain of events surrounding the charged crimes, including context\n\nand setup . . . .” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1211.74\n\n       Finally, defendant-appellants point out that the two trials were severed and\n\nthat “[s]everance under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is\n\nwarranted only when a defendant demonstrates that a joint trial will result in\n\n‘specific and compelling prejudice’ to his defense.” Defendant-appellants argue\n\nthat, because the district court severed the case, it “must have found that the jury\n\nwould be unable to consider the evidence separately as it pertained to individual\n\ndefendants.”\n\n       This argument is unavailing. The district judge who severed these cases\n\nstated in a later telephone conference that, “perhaps some of [these cases] didn’t\n\neven call for severance, but I leaned toward trying to avoid as much confusion as I\n\n\n\n       74\n          The district court also did not err in admitting evidence of cash deposits to McNair’s\nstudio’s construction account. See United States v. Lattimore, 902 F.2d 902, 903 (11th Cir.\n1990) (stating “[w]here the charged crime involves pecuniary gain and the Government presents\nother evidence of the defendant’s guilt, evidence of the sudden acquisition of money by the\ndefendant or his or her spouse is admissible, even if the Government does not trace the source of\nthis new wealth.”). This evidence was highly relevant to McNair’s intent to accept goods and\nservices bribes, especially since these cash deposits were to the McNair studio account and the\ngoods and services bribes involved the same McNair studio. The cash deposits also were listed\nas overt acts in Count 50. The defendants also have not shown reversible error as to their claim\nof untimely notice under 404(b).\n\n                                               97\n\fcould.” In the same teleconference, the district court ruled that 404(b) evidence of\n\nother bribes was relevant and that jury instructions would prevent improper use of\n\nthat evidence. (“I’m going to assume that if I tell them three or four times, they’ll\n\nunderstand it.”) At the beginning of the McNair trial, the court stated the cases\n\nwere severed because it would be “cumbersome to try” them together, but “[t]hat\n\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that evidentiarily, they’re not related.” During the\n\nMcNair trial, the district court again rejected defendant-appellants’ argument that\n\nseverance of the counts meant that evidence related to the severed counts was\n\nirrelevant, stating:\n\n       But that doesn’t have anything to do with whether or not something is or\n       is not relevant evidence to some other situation. That’s like saying, they\n       indicted them for a bank robbery thing but you can’t show that they\n       spent some of the cash over here in another deal or something.\n\nDefendant-appellants cite no legal support for their argument that severance per se\n\nmeans other bribe evidence cannot be admitted. That the district court gave the\n\ndefendants the benefit of trying McNair and the contractor-defendants in one trial,\n\nand then Swann and the contractor-defendants in a separate trial, does not mean all\n\nevidence about bribes to Swann could not be introduced in the McNair trial and\n\nvice versa.\n\n         IX. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN MCNAIR TRIAL\n\n       As to their convictions in the McNair trial, defendants PUGH and Roland\n\n                                           98\n\fPugh argue that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by (1) failing to correct\n\nGrady Pugh’s false testimony, and (2) eliciting additional false testimony from\n\nGrady Pugh, thereby violating their due process rights.75 Specifically, these\n\ndefendants argue that at trial Grady Pugh falsely denied having previously said he\n\ndelivered cash bribes to McNair before a May 24, 2000 trip to buy carpet and\n\nfalsely testified that he delivered the money after that May 24, 2000 trip.\n\n       These cash bribes were part of Counts 13 and 14. During the McNair trial,\n\nthe time line of these events was at issue because it determined whether Counts 13\n\nand 14 were barred by the statute of limitations.76 The jury acquitted PUGH and\n\nRoland Pugh on Counts 13 and 14.77 While the acquittal moots the statute of\n\nlimitations issue, the time line of the cash bribes remains relevant only as to Count\n\n1 (bribery conspiracy) and only because those cash bribes were alleged as overt\n\n\n       75\n        PUGH’s brief specifically adopts Roland Pugh’s prosecutorial misconduct arguments,\nand Roland Pugh adopts all relevant portions of PUGH’s brief as to all issues. McNair, RAST,\nBobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty adopt all arguments of all defendants as to all\nissues.\n       76\n         The parties referenced the five-year limitations period for Counts 13 and 14 as from\nAugust 26, 2000 to August 26, 2005, the date the Second Supseding Indictment was submitted,\nwhich added Roland Pugh as a defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 3282. Count 13 charged PUGH and\nYessick with giving McNair $20,000 in cash. Count 14 charged PUGH and Roland Pugh with\ngiving McNair at least $10,000 in cash in January 2001. However, if the cash bribes occurred\nbefore the May 24, 2000 carpet purchase in Georgia, the defendants argued Counts 13 and 14\nwould be barred by the five-year statute of limitations.\n       77\n         While PUGH was convicted on multiple counts, Roland Pugh was convicted on only\nCount 1, the bribery conspiracy count. Other than some documentary evidence, Grady Pugh was\nthe only witness testifying against Roland Pugh as to Count 1.\n\n                                              99\n\facts in furtherance of the overall conspiracy to bribe McNair, for which PUGH and\n\nRoland Pugh were convicted. On appeal PUGH and Roland Pugh argue Grady\n\nPugh’s false testimony about the time line goes to his credibility and that if the jury\n\nknew he was lying, this could have affected the guilty verdict on Count 1.78\n\n       To establish prosecutorial misconduct for the use of false testimony, a\n\ndefendant must show the prosecutor knowingly used perjured testimony, or failed\n\nto correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony, and that the falsehood\n\nwas material.79 See United States v. Woodruff, 296 F.3d 1041, 1043 n.1 (11th Cir.\n\n2002); United States v. Dickerson, 248 F.3d 1036, 1041 (11th Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Alzate, 47 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir. 1995); see also Napue v. Illinois,\n\n360 U.S. 264, 270-71, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 1177-78 (1959). Perjury is defined as\n\ntestimony “given with the willful intent to provide false testimony and not as a\n\nresult of a mistake, confusion, or faulty memory.” United States v. Ellisor, 522\n\nF.3d 1255, 1277 n.34 (11th Cir. 2008).\n\n       “When a government lawyer elicits false testimony that goes to a witness’s\n\ncredibility, we will consider it sufficiently material to warrant a new trial only\n\n\n       78\n         For the conspiracy charged in Count 1, it did not matter whether the cash deliveries\nwere within the statute of limitations because there was ample evidence of other overt acts\nwithin the five-year statute of limitations period. See United States v. Arias, 431 F.3d 1327,\n1340 (11th Cir. 2005).\n       79\n         We review a claim of prosecutorial misconduct de novo because it is a mixed question\nof law and fact. United States v. Duran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1299 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\n                                               100\n\fwhen the estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of the given witness may well\n\nbe determinative of guilt or innocence.” United States v. Cole, 755 F.2d 748, 763\n\n(11th Cir. 1985) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). In other words, “[t]he\n\nmateriality element is satisfied if the false testimony could reasonably be taken to\n\nput the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the\n\nverdict.” Dickerson, 248 F.3d at 1041 (quotation marks omitted). The false\n\ntestimony is deemed material if there is a reasonable likelihood the false testimony\n\ncould have affected the judgment of the jury. Alzate, 47 F.3d at 1110; United\n\nStates v. Barham, 595 F.2d 231, 242 (5th Cir. 1979).\n\n       In addition, a prior statement that is merely inconsistent with a government\n\nwitness’s testimony is insufficient to establish prosecutorial misconduct. United\n\nStates v. Michael, 17 F.3d 1383, 1385 (11th Cir. 1994) (“We refuse to impute\n\nknowledge of falsity to the prosecutor where a key government witness’[s]\n\ntestimony is in conflict with another’s statement or testimony.”); Hays v. Alabama,\n\n85 F.3d 1492, 1499 (11th Cir. 1996) (determining there was no due process\n\nviolation where “there has been no showing that [the witness’s] later, rather than\n\nearlier, testimony was false”); United States v. Gibbs, 662 F.2d 728, 730 (11th Cir.\n\n1981) (“Though knowing prosecutorial use of false evidence or perjured testimony\n\nviolates due process . . . it is not enough that the testimony . . . is inconsistent with\n\n\n\n                                            101\n\fprior statements.”); United States v. Brown, 634 F.2d 819, 827 (5th Cir. 1981)\n\n(“[D]ue process is not implicated by the prosecution’s introduction or allowance of\n\nfalse or perjured testimony unless the prosecution actually knows or believes the\n\ntestimony to be false or perjured; it is not enough that the testimony is challenged\n\nby another witness or is inconsistent with prior statements.”).\n\nA.    Grady Pugh’s Testimony About Cash Deliveries\n\n      The false testimony claim stems from notes the prosecutor made during\n\nGrady Pugh’s two meetings with the prosecutor for plea negotiations on June 17\n\nand 21, 2005. An FBI agent, counsel for Grady Pugh, and separate corporate\n\ncounsel for PUGH were also present. The prosecutor’s 2005 notes refer to Grady\n\nPugh’s two cash deliveries to McNair and his trip to Georgia where Grady\n\npurchased carpet for McNair on May 24, 2000 (for which Grady signed a PUGH\n\ncompany check bearing that date). The government disclosed the prosecutor’s\n\nnotes to defense counsel several months before trial.\n\n      At the McNair trial, Grady Pugh testified he delivered two envelopes of cash\n\nto McNair — the first at McNair’s studio and the second at McNair’s home at\n\nChristmas 2000 — both after he (Grady Pugh) took a flight to Georgia to purchase\n\nthe carpet on May 24, 2000. In response, PUGH’s counsel sought to impeach\n\nGrady Pugh using the prosecutor’s 2005 notes, attempting to show the notes\n\n\n\n                                          102\n\freflected Grady Pugh gave both cash envelopes to McNair before Grady Pugh\n\npurchased the carpet on May 24, 2000. PUGH’s counsel showed Grady Pugh the\n\nnotes of the June 17, 2005 meeting indicating Grady delivered two cash envelopes\n\nto McNair:\n\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     It says in here that I delivered money to the studio\n                        and to his house, in these notes. . . .\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: Does it not say, the next time that Roland [Pugh]\n                        asked Grady [Pugh] to deliver an envelope of\n                        money, it was to McNair, was at McNair’s studio?\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     It says that, yes, sir.\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: Okay. Despite that, that does not refresh your\n                        recollection?\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     Despite what it says, it’s not true.80\n\nPUGH’s counsel then showed Grady Pugh the prosecutor’s notes from the June 21,\n\n2005 meeting and asked if he recalled that he told the prosecutor the two cash\n\n\n      80\n        The June 17, 2005 meeting notes state:\n      –Roland Pugh asked Grady to deliver the money to McNair\n      –One Roland money [sic]\n      –Grady recalls being at Northport and having to take the envelope, which was a half inch\n      thick, to McNair’s house\n      –Grady and McNair sat down together in the house and chatted and then Grady left the\n      envelope there between the two of them where McNair saw him put it\n      –The next time that Roland asked Grady to deliver an envelope of money it was to\n      McNair was at McNair Studio\n      –McNair was late and Grady had to wait for him\n      –When McNair showed up, Grady and McNair went to the van where they chatted and\n      then Grady left the envelope there where McNair saw him put it down\n      –This delivery of money was after the shell of the studio had been erected\n      –Roland Pugh called Grady and told him that “McNair needs to look at some carpet” (or\n      words to that effect) and that McNair needed RPC [PUGH] to make the deposit on the\n      carpet\n      –Grady got the company plane to Birmingham and took McNair’s daughter and Bill\n      Bailey to LaGrange, Georgia to pick out the carpet\n\n                                             103\n\fdeliveries were before the carpet trip, but Grady replied he did not recall saying it\n\nin that order as follows:\n\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: I want to direct you to the portion of [the\n                        prosecutor’s] notes which read, Grady [Pugh]\n                        delivered the second envelope of cash to McNair at\n                        the studio.\n                        ....\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: And after that, I want to direct your attention to the\n                        portion of [the prosecutor’s] notes that say, Bill\n                        Bailey was there. And it continues, quote “best I\n                        recall” close quote, this was the first time Grady\n                        [Pugh] met Bill Bailey; and then it continues.\n                        Months later, Grady [Pugh] flew to Georgia for the\n                        carpet. . . . Does this refresh your memory that when\n                        you met with [the prosecutor and an FBI agent], that\n                        the sequence you provided was that the first delivery\n                        was to the house, the second delivery was to the\n                        studio, and they were both done months before you\n                        flew to Georgia for the carpet?\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     I don’t recall saying it in that order. The order that\n                        I remember it in, is the order that I told you Friday.\n                        I went to the studio first, then I went to the carpet,\n                        and then I went to Mr. McNair’s house; and that’s\n                        the way I remember it. That’s the way it\n                        happened.[81]\n\n\n      81\n       The June 21, 2005 meeting notes state:\n      –Grady thinks the RPC [PUGH] office was still in Northport when he delivered the first\n      envelope to McNair\n      –Grady had to drive from Northport\n      –Grady thinks the second McNair envelope was when RPC’s office was in the trailers in\n      Avondale\n      ....\n      –Grady delivered the second envelope of cash to McNair at the studio\n      –He and McNair had already spoken inside the studio and then went to McNair’s van\n      –Bill Bailey was there when Grady delivered the cash to McNair Studio but Grady does\n      not appear to recall talking to Bailey about the money he was giving to McNair\n\n                                            104\n\f      PUGH’s counsel suggested to the district court that he might call the\n\nprosecutor as a witness. The Court responded: “I think whatever you’d be calling\n\nhim for doesn’t amount to a hill of beans, and I’m not going to let it be done just to\n\ncause friction or embarrassment or whatever. So my strong inclination will be not\n\nto allow it.” The defense did not call the prosecutor to testify.\n\n      In closing argument, PUGH’s counsel argued Grady Pugh lied about the\n\ntime line of these events, that his cash deliveries occurred outside the statute of\n\nlimitations, and that the prosecutor’s notes supported this argument. PUGH’s\n\ncounsel also recited portions of the prosecutor’s notes.82\n\n\n      –‘Best I recall’ this was the first time Grady met Bill Bailey\n      –The weather was sunny but not cold\n      –Months later, Grady flew to Georgia for the carpet\n      82\n        In closing argument, PUGH’s counsel stated:\n      And then you heard on Monday, I finally got to show in Mr. Dillon’s notes of that\n      very interview. And he read to you from Mr. Dillon’s own notes of the June 17th\n      meetings. And he read to you, where they were talking chronologically in the June\n      17th, the first meeting, where he said that he delivered a note, an envelope to Mr.\n      McNair’s house, and the next time he was asked to deliver the envelope to the studio,\n      and that then he was talking chronologically about going to look for carpet. And it\n      was even clearer when he got into the notes of the second interview where he said\n      he delivered the second envelope of cash to McNair at the studio, the best he could\n      recall. Remember I even got him -- I think it was in quotes. Best I recall, this was\n      the first time Grady met Bill Bailey. The next line, months later, Grady flew to\n      Georgia for the carpet. Those are from Mr. Dillon’s own notes of that meeting and\n      that’s what you heard the testimony was. Those do not establish any payment in\n      July, whatsoever. They don’t establish any payment that’s been alleged in this case\n      whatsoever. . . .\n      He gave even another story while on the stand. I was asking about the sequence and\n      I was asking him whether these notes from his meeting refreshed his memory and he\n      said I don’t recall saying it in that order. The order that I remember it in is the order\n      that I told you Friday. I went to the studio first, then I went to the carpet, and then\n\n                                                105\n\f       We conclude defendants PUGH and Roland Pugh have not met their burden\n\nto show Grady Pugh’s testimony was actually false, much less that the government\n\nknew it was false. First, the notes themselves are in bullet form and contain no\n\ndates nor any explicit indication that they were necessarily intended to be read in\n\nchronological order. At trial Grady Pugh agreed he had a “clear recollection” of\n\nwhat he said during the meetings. At trial Grady Pugh reviewed the notes on\n\ndefense counsel’s instruction and stated that the notes were “not laid out in the\n\norder that things happened,” that he did not “recall saying it in that order,” and,\n\n“[d]espite what it says, it’s not true.”83\n\n       Importantly, the documentary evidence is consistent with Grady Pugh’s trial\n\ntestimony that he delivered the money after the carpet purchase. The government\n\nintroduced these checks: on May 24, 2000, Grady Pugh signed a $4,820.81 PUGH\n\ncheck made out to the carpet store; on July 18-19, 2000, Grady Pugh, Roland\n\nPugh, and Yessick signed checks to cash totaling $9,000; and from December 15 to\n\n22, 2000, Roland Pugh signed $38,750 in checks to Roland Pugh’s\n\ndaughters-in-law and to cash. Further, other witnesses corroborated Grady Pugh’s\n\n\n\n       I went to Mr. McNair’s house, that’s the way I remember it; and that’s the way it\n       happened.\n\n       83\n         Nothing in the record indicates that after the 2005 meetings, Grady Pugh checked or\nadopted the prosecutor’s notes.\n\n                                              106\n\ftrial testimony. For example, Bill Bailey testified he flew with Grady to pick out\n\ncarpet and saw him “again” at the studio, where they “talked about airplanes for a\n\nsecond” before Bailey asked Grady “if he was here to help Chris McNair again,” to\n\nwhich Grady answered yes.\n\n      Even assuming that Grady Pugh’s denials of prior inconsistency were false\n\nor his time line of events was false, defendants, at a minimum, have not shown the\n\nprosecutor knew Grady Pugh’s testimony was false, especially given how the\n\ndocuments and other witnesses corroborated his testimony.\n\n      In any event, defendants have shown no reversible error. The jury heard the\n\nrelevant portions of the notes read into the record when PUGH’s counsel was\n\ncross-examining Grady Pugh. During closing arguments, PUGH’s counsel argued\n\nthat the prosecutor’s notes contradicted Grady Pugh’s trial testimony and again\n\nrecited relevant portions of the notes. Defense counsel thoroughly and\n\nexhaustively cross-examined Grady Pugh. Defense counsel pointed out other\n\ninconsistencies within Grady Pugh’s trial testimony and in his grand jury\n\ntestimony. The jury was also well aware Grady Pugh had made a plea deal and\n\nthat the government’s assessment of his cooperation would impact his eventual\n\nsentence. The jury had the information it needed to make an informed decision as\n\nto Grady Pugh’s credibility. See United States v. Calderon, 127 F.3d 1314, 1325\n\n\n\n                                         107\n\f(11th Cir. 1997) (“[C]redibility determinations are the exclusive province of the\n\njury.”) (quotation marks omitted). “Therefore, because we find that the\n\nuncorrected, allegedly perjurious statements do not ‘undermine confidence in the\n\nverdict,’” we reject defendants’ prosecutorial misconduct claims. Dickerson, 248\n\nF.3d at 1042 (citations omitted).84\n\nB.     Grady Pugh’s Testimony About Note-Taking\n\n       Defendants PUGH and Roland Pugh also claim the prosecutor intentionally\n\nelicited from Grady Pugh the false testimony that “everyone was taking notes” at\n\nthe 2005 meetings, even though the prosecutor knew he had instructed the FBI\n\nagent not to take notes.85\n\n       At trial the prosecutor asked Grady Pugh about the note-taking:\n\n       Q:      And when you signed that plea agreement, Mr. Pugh, had you\n               already met with us on two occasions at the FBI office?\n       A:      Yes, sir.\n       Q:      And when you met with the FBI and myself, was your lawyer\n               there?\n       A:      Yes, sir.\n       Q:      And was the company lawyer there?\n       A:      Yes, sir.\n\n\n       84\n         We note the defense did not call others present at the 2005 meetings as to what Grady\nPugh said. And regardless of whether others at the 2005 meetings were taking notes, defense\ncounsel still could have called them to elicit their personal recollection of what Grady Pugh said.\nHowever, we need not rely on this fact as it is abundantly clear counsel effectively cross-\nexamined Grady Pugh.\n       85\n        The prosecutor acknowledged he told the FBI agent not to take notes during the 2005\nmeetings.\n\n                                                108\n\f       Q:     And was everybody taking notes?\n       A:     Yes, sir.\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense attempted to clarify this assertion, but Grady\n\nPugh stated that it “looked to me like everybody was taking notes.” PUGH’s\n\ncorporate counsel asked Grady Pugh, “[a]nd do you remember that I objected and I\n\nindicated that I would take notes?”\n\n       The foregoing colloquy is ambiguous as to whether the prosecutor was\n\nreferring to the lawyers in the room or also to the FBI agent. Grady Pugh\n\nreasonably could have taken “everybody” to mean the two lawyers about whom the\n\ndefense had just asked. Moreover, while the record shows the FBI agent was not\n\ntaking notes, defendants submitted no evidence that Grady Pugh’s counsel or\n\nPUGH’s counsel were not taking notes.86 In sum, the defense has not met its\n\nburden to show the prosecutor believed or knew Grady Pugh’s note-taking\n\ntestimony was false. In any event, the defendants have not shown a reasonable\n\nlikelihood that correction on this particular point, even if it did constitute “false\n\ntestimony,” could have changed the jury’s evaluation of Grady Pugh’s overall\n\n\n\n       86\n         The government stresses it would have been remarkable had Grady Pugh’s counsel not\ntaken notes during his own client’s debriefings and plea negotiations in these two meetings. The\nprosecutor also points out that there is a reference in a December 2005 hearing before the\nmagistrate judge that there was note-taking by Grady Pugh and PUGH’s counsel at these\nmeetings. We need not rely on that reference because it is enough to say defendants submitted\nno evidence that Grady Pugh or PUGH’s counsel were not taking notes and have not carried\ntheir burden to show Grady Pugh’s testimony was false.\n\n                                              109\n\fcredibility. Therefore, it does not undermine confidence in the verdict. See\n\nDickerson, 248 F.3d at 1041.\n\n              X. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN WILSON TRIAL\n\n       In the Wilson case, defendant PUGH claims the district court erred by\n\ndenying its motion to dismiss Count 75 as time-barred under the five-year statute\n\nof limitations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3282.87 Count 75 charged that from about August\n\n1999 and continuing though June 2000, defendants PUGH and Wilson (as the\n\nJCESD’s Chief Engineer) entered into a bribery conspiracy whereby Wilson\n\ncorruptly solicited and accepted, and PUGH corruptly gave, a $4,500 payment (in\n\nthe form of a bogus scholarship for Wilson’s son) with the intent of influencing\n\nand rewarding Wilson for supporting PUGH’s interests in connection with the\n\nJCESD sewer rehabilitation reconstruction program. Count 75 alleged that an\n\nobject of the conspiracy was for Wilson to enrich himself and that PUGH and\n\nWilson conspired to conceal PUGH’s payment to Wilson by having it disguised as\n\na bogus scholarship to UAB.\n\n       PUGH argues that Count 75 falls outside of the five-year limitations period\n\nbecause the latest overt act by a co-conspirator charged in the Indictment — Grady\n\n\n\n       87\n          “We review a district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for an abuse\nof discretion.” United States v. Clarke, 312 F.3d 1343, 1345 n.1 (11th Cir. 2002). “We review\nthe district court’s interpretation and application of statutes of limitations de novo.” Id.\n\n                                               110\n\fPugh’s sending a $4,500 check to UAB — was committed no later than August 24,\n\n1999, which was outside the limitations period of February 7, 2000 to February 7,\n\n2005.88 The government responds that the Indictment charged Wilson’s receipt of\n\nthe benefit of UAB’s four quarterly disbursements to his son as four separate overt\n\nacts, and the last two disbursements (March 17 and June 7, 2000) were made to the\n\nson within five years of PUGH’s indictment on February 7, 2005. In reply, PUGH\n\nstresses that it is undisputed that UAB and Wilson’s son were not members of the\n\nbribery conspiracy, and thus there was no overt act by a co-conspirator within the\n\nlimitations period.\n\n       “In a conspiracy prosecution brought under § 371 the government in order to\n\navoid the bar of the limitation period of § 3282 must show the existence of the\n\nconspiracy within the five years prior to the return of the indictment, and must\n\nallege and prove the commission of at least one overt act by one of the conspirators\n\nwithin that period in furtherance of the conspiratorial agreement.” United States v.\n\nDavis, 533 F.2d 921, 926 (5th Cir. 1976); see Grunewald v. United States, 353\n\nU.S. 391, 396, 77 S. Ct. 963, 969-70 (1957) (addressing a three-year limitations\n\nperiod and concluding the government must prove that conspiracy was still in\n\n\n\n       88\n          In this statute of limitations calculation, the parties use the February 7, 2005 date of the\ninitial indictment. While the initial indictment itself bears the dates of February 3 and February\n7, we use what the parties use.\n\n                                                 111\n\fexistence at beginning of limitations period and that at least one overt act was\n\nperformed after that date); United States v. Dynalectric Co., 859 F.2d 1559, 1564\n\nn.6 (11th Cir. 1988) (stating if an overt act is necessary for the commission of the\n\nconspiracy, then “the indictment must charge and the evidence at trial must show\n\nthat an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was made within the limitations\n\nperiod”).\n\n       By contrast, for “conspiracy statutes that do not require proof of an overt act,\n\nthe indictment satisfies the requirements of the statute of limitations if the\n\nconspiracy is alleged to have continued into the limitations period.” United States\n\nv. Gonzalez, 921 F.2d 1530, 1548 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted) (determining RICO conspiracy statute, unlike the general federal\n\nconspiracy statute, does not require an overt act). Unlike conspiracy statutes that\n\ndo not require proof of an overt act,89 the conspiracy statute PUGH was charged\n\nunder, 18 U.S.C. § 371, does require proof of an overt act. See 18 U.S.C. § 371\n\n(requiring that “one or more [co-conspirators] do any act to effect the object of the\n\nconspiracy”).\n\n       As recounted above, Wilson solicited the bribe to help pay his son’s college\n\n\n       89\n        For example, neither a drug conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. § 846 nor a RICO conspiracy\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) requires proof of an overt act. See United States v.\nTerzado-Madruga, 897 F.2d 1099, 1121 (11th Cir. 1990) (drug conspiracy); United States v.\nCoia, 719 F.2d 1120, 1124 (11th Cir. 1983) (RICO conspiracy).\n\n                                            112\n\fexpenses in mid-1999, and Grady Pugh mailed a $4,500 check to UAB on August\n\n24, 1999. Because the tuition had already been paid by FWDE, Wilson did not\n\nactually receive the full benefit of the $4,500 check until UAB disbursed the final\n\ninstallment to Wilson’s son in June 2000. The money disbursed to the son was a\n\nbenefit to Wilson because he would otherwise have paid his son’s expenses\n\nhimself. Furthermore, where enrichment is an object of a conspiracy, the\n\nconspiracy continues until the conspirators receive the full economic benefits\n\nanticipated by their scheme, and a conspirator’s receipt of a benefit can be\n\nconsidered an overt act. See United States v. Anderson, 326 F.3d 1319, 1328 (11th\n\nCir. 2003); United States v. Girard, 744 F.2d 1170, 1171-74 (5th Cir. 1984). For\n\nexample, in Anderson, the defendants conspired to obtain contracts by rigging bids\n\nin violation of antitrust laws and § 371. Id. at 1323. Although the bid-rigging\n\ncontracts were beyond the limitations period, the final payment on one of the\n\ncontracts came within it. Id. at 1328. The defendant Anderson contended that the\n\nfinal “payment was not an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy but merely the\n\nresult of the conspiracy.” Id. This Court held that a conspirator’s acceptance of\n\npayment on the illegally obtained contract constituted an overt act in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy and brought the conspiracy within the statute of limitations. Id.\n\n      Although acceptance or receipt of a benefit can be an overt act, that overt act\n\n\n\n                                         113\n\fmust be an act that is knowingly committed. See United States v. Hogue, 812 F.2d\n\n1568, 1579 (11th Cir. 1987) (stating as an “essential element[]” of a § 371 offense\n\nthat “the overt act was knowingly committed”); Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury\n\nInstructions (Criminal Cases) at 137 (2003) (“An ‘overt act’ [under § 371] is any\n\ntransaction or event . . . which is knowingly committed by a conspirator in an effort\n\nto accomplish some object of the conspiracy.”). The jury in the Wilson trial was\n\ncorrectly instructed on this point.\n\n      The problem for the government is the last two disbursements in 2000 were\n\nfrom a non-conspirator (UAB) to another non-conspirator (the son), and the\n\ngovernment presented no evidence that defendant PUGH (through Grady Pugh) or\n\nWilson knew that Wilson was receiving part of the benefit of the $4,500 in March\n\nor June 2000, rather than all at once in August 1999. There is also no evidence that\n\nGrady Pugh or Wilson gave any direction to UAB after August 24, 1999. At trial,\n\nGrady Pugh testified he was unaware of UAB’s disbursement arrangements, and\n\nno evidence contradicted him on that point. Likewise, there was no evidence that\n\nWilson was aware of the timing of the disbursements or that Wilson had any\n\ncommunications at all with UAB after the $4,500 check was sent on August 24,\n\n1999. Accordingly, Wilson’s receipt of the benefit of the March and June 2000\n\ndisbursements cannot be considered “overt acts” knowingly committed by him,\n\n\n\n                                         114\n\fand the bribery conspiracy in Count 75 was beyond the statute of limitations.90\n\n       For these reasons, we reverse PUGH’s conviction on Count 75.\n\n                                XI. WHARTON’S RULE\n\n       Defendants argue they cannot be charged, convicted, or sentenced on both\n\nconspiracy to commit § 666 bribery and the substantive § 666 offenses, and thus\n\ntheir convictions violate Wharton’s Rule. Roland Pugh additionally claims his sole\n\nconviction on Count 1 is barred by Wharton’s Rule.\n\n       As the Supreme Court noted in Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 95 S.\n\nCt. 1284 (1975), ordinarily a defendant can be convicted of both conspiracy to\n\ncommit a crime and the substantive crime itself. Id. at 777, 95 S. Ct. at 1289-90.\n\nHistorically, Wharton’s Rule was only a narrow common law exception that\n\nprovided that a defendant cannot be punished for conspiracy and a substantive\n\noffense if the substantive offense itself requires the participation of two persons.\n\nSee Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 773, 95 S. Ct. at 1288. “The basic idea of Wharton’s Rule\n\nis that where a [substantive] crime requires a plurality of agents for its commission,\n\na charge of conspiracy cannot be used to impose a heavier penalty.” United States\n\n\n\n\n       90\n         The knowledge requirement was not at issue in Anderson, where the conspirator\nreceived the last payment or benefit directly. Anderson, 326 F.3d at 1328. While a third party\ncan receive the payment on behalf of a conspirator (for example to disguise the payment), the\nconspirator must at least be aware of it. There was simply no evidence that Grady Pugh or\nWilson was aware of how UAB applied and disbursed the money in 2000.\n\n                                              115\n\fv. Collins, 779 F.2d 1520, 1527-28 (11th Cir. 1986).\n\n      Wharton’s Rule reflects an era where conspiracy law was still developing,\n\nand it traditionally applied to offenses such as adultery, incest, bigamy, and dueling\n\nthat were “characterized by the general congruence of the agreement and the\n\ncompleted substantive offense. . . .” Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 782, 95 S. Ct. at 1292.\n\nWharton’s Rule, however, is not grounded in the Constitution or in double\n\njeopardy law and “has ‘current vitality only as a judicial presumption, to be applied\n\nin the absence of legislative intent to the contrary.’” Collins, 779 F.2d at 1528\n\n(quoting Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 782, 95 S. Ct. at 1292); accord Curtis v. United\n\nStates, 546 F.2d 1188, 1190 (5th Cir. 1977). “The former Fifth Circuit did not\n\ngenerally favor Wharton’s Rule, and it expressed doubt that it could ever be\n\napplicable to a conspiracy to distribute narcotics.” Collins, 779 F.2d at 1528\n\n(citing Curtis, 546 F.2d at 1190); see United States v. Previte, 648 F.2d 73, 77 (1st\n\nCir. 1981) (stating “Wharton’s Rule is, to some extent a relic of the discredited\n\nmerger doctrine and should be interpreted narrowly” and explaining “the Rule does\n\nnot forbid charging both a conspiracy and the substantive offense, even when it\n\napplies” as it “merely forbids sentencing on both counts”).\n\n      In Iannelli, the Supreme Court held that Wharton’s Rule did not apply to an\n\nillegal gambling statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1955. Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 791, 95 S. Ct.\n\n\n\n                                          116\n\f1296. The Supreme Court determined Congress intended that conspiracy to violate\n\n§ 1955 and the substantive § 1955 offense should be separate crimes, stating,\n\n“[h]ad Congress intended to foreclose the possibility of prosecuting conspiracy\n\noffenses under § 371 by merging them into prosecutions under § 1955, we think it\n\nwould have so indicated explicitly.” Id. at 789, 95 S. Ct. at 1296.\n\n      We have already rejected, albeit without discussion, a Wharton’s Rule\n\nchallenge to a conviction for conspiracy to commit § 201 bribery. United States v.\n\nEvans, 344 F.3d 1131, 1133 & n.2 (11th Cir. 2003); see United States v. Finazzo,\n\n704 F.2d 300, 306 (6th Cir. 1983) (holding Wharton’s Rule does not apply to a\n\n§ 371 conspiracy to commit § 201 bribery, noting “the consequences of bribery not\n\nonly affect the parties to the crime but have a negative effect on society at large,”\n\nand pointing out “the agreement connected with the substantive offense of bribery\n\n. . . poses ‘the distinct kinds of threats to society that the law of conspiracy seeks to\n\navert’”) (quoting Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 783, 95 S. Ct. at 1292).\n\n      Other circuits have concluded Wharton’s Rule does not preclude a\n\nconviction for conspiracy to violate § 666(a)(1)(B). See United States v. Bornman,\n\n559 F.3d 150, 156 (3d Cir. 2009); United States v. Hines, 541 F.3d 833, 838 (8th\n\nCir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1385 (2009).\n\n      We now hold Wharton’s Rule does not apply to § 666 crimes for two\n\n\n\n                                           117\n\freasons, either one of which is sufficient alone. For starters, Congress has not\n\nexpressed any intent that § 666 crimes and § 371 crimes for conspiracy to violate\n\n§ 666 should merge. If Congress had intended to foreclose prosecuting § 371\n\nconspiracy offenses in § 666 crimes, it could have said so or merged the offenses.\n\nDefendants point to nothing in the legislative history that suggests any intent to\n\ndepart from the established general rule that a court can impose separate sentences\n\nfor conspiracy to commit bribery and the substantive offense itself.\n\n       Second, the effect of the crime of § 666 bribery is not limited to the\n\nbribe-payor and recipient, as the crime involves public corruption, which harms\n\nsociety as a whole. “The purpose of § 666, to protect the integrity of federal funds,\n\nindicates that the immediate consequences of the behavior it proscribes rest on\n\nsociety at large,” in this case, on the federal government and the people of\n\nJefferson County. Hines, 541 F.3d at 838 (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,\n\nwe reject defendants’ claims based on Wharton’s Rule.91\n\n\n       91\n          The defendant-appellants raise these additional conviction-related issues. Swann argues\nthat (1) there was a material variance as to the conspiracy charged in the Indictment and any\nconspiracy proven, (2) the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on multiple\nconspiracies, (3) the district court erred in not giving his proposed good faith instruction, (4) the\ndistrict court should have severed his case alone for trial and apart from the contractor-\ndefendants who bribed him, and (5) the district court committed cumulative error.\n         Roland Pugh and PUGH argue that (1) the district court erred in not giving a proposed\ninstruction defining goodwill gifts and legal gratuities, (2) Count 15 as to PUGH should have\nbeen dismissed as “duplicitous,” (3) there was a material variance as to their convictions for\nbribery conspiracy, (4) their involvement at most consisted of one-time buyer-seller transactions\ninsufficient to sustain a conspiracy conviction, and (5) the district court committed cumulative\n\n                                                118\n\f                             XII. MCNAIR’S SENTENCE 92\n\n       McNair was sentenced to concurrent 60-month sentences on one bribery\n\nconspiracy count (Count 1) and ten substantive bribery counts (Counts 2-3, 5-12)\n\nfrom the McNair trial and one bribery conspiracy count from the USI case (Count\n\n32).93 The district court ordered McNair to pay restitution of $851,927 to the\n\nJefferson County Commission and a special assessment of $1,200 but no fine.\n\nThis restitution represented $376,927 in bribes to McNair by Dawson and the\n\nPugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants, and $475,000 in bribes to McNair by the\n\nUSI contractors.94 On appeal, McNair challenges only the restitution part of his\n\nerror. As noted before, McNair, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty adopt\nall arguments of all defendants as to all issues. In his cumulative error claims, Swann adopts all\narguments of all defendants as to all issues.\n        After review and oral argument, we conclude there is no reversible error as to any of\nthese listed issues or as to any other conviction-related issues raised by any defendants.\n       92\n        Defendants McNair, Swann, and PUGH appeal their sentences. Defendants Roland\nPugh, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty do not appeal their sentences.\n       93\n          McNair pled guilty to Count 32 in the USI case. In his plea agreement, he waived the\nright to “challenge any sentence so imposed or the manner in which the sentence was\ndetermined.” Thus, McNair waived his right to challenge his sentence as to Count 32. See\nUnited States v. Johnson, 541 F.3d 1064, 1067 (11th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2792\n(2009) (“[A] waiver of the right to appeal a sentence necessarily includes a waiver of the right to\nappeal the restitution imposed.”). Accordingly, we consider McNair’s sentence on only Counts\n1, 2-3, 5-12 in the McNair case. The district court did not tie or link the restitution to Count 32\nso we reject the government’s argument that McNair has waived his right to challenge the\nrestitution.\n       94\n          This $851,927 consisted of:\n        (1) $142,921 from PUGH ($11,709 for concrete work; three $20,000 payments; $4,820\ncarpet purchase; $17,200 in handrails; $5,000 retirement payment; and $44,192 check to George\nWord for McNair’s Arkansas home);\n        (2) $84,566 from RAST ($52,990 in construction work by Mosley; $5,866 for security\n\n                                                119\n\fsentence.95\n\nA.     Presentence Report\n\n       McNair’s presentence investigation report (“PSI”): (1) assigned McNair a\n\nbase offense level of 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2C1.1 (2001); (2) added 2 levels\n\nbecause McNair’s conduct involved more than one bribe, pursuant to\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(1); and (3) added 24 levels because the net profit or benefit\n\n($67,980,043)96 to the contractors in connection with their bribes of McNair was\n\n\ngate; $5,300 in carpet installation by Gilley; $5,500 in landscaping by Bailey & Sons; $1,775 in\nplumbing by Buchanan; $5,000 retirement payment; and $8,135 for Alaskan cruise);\n        (3) $133,040 from FWDE ($74,220 to Bailey for supervision; $5,000 retirement\npayment; $50,000 check to George Word for Arkansas home; and $3,820 for construction work\non guard shack);\n        (4) $16,400 from Dawson for an audio visual system; and\n        (5) $475,000 from USI ($335,000 in cash and $140,000 paid on bogus invoices).\nIn the restitution amount, the district court included bribe amounts from some of the counts\neither that were not submitted to the jury (such as counts involving the Arkansas home and the\nthree $5,000 payments after McNair’s retirement) or on which McNair was acquitted (such as\ncash bribes).\n        In our earlier recitation of the jury’s verdict, we used the amount of the bribe listed in the\nIndictment. During trial or at sentencing, the government proved that some bribe amounts\nactually were higher. For example, the Indictment as to Swann alleged the amount paid to\nStanger was $24,176, but the ultimate amount proved was $28,839. The Indictment as to\nMcNair alleged the amount paid to Bailey was $27,434, but the ultimate amount proved was\n$74,220.\n       95\n         This Court reviews de novo “the legality of an order of restitution,” and reviews for an\nabuse of discretion the determination of the restitution “value” of lost or destroyed property.\nUnited States v. Robertson, 493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir. 2007). This Court reviews for clear\nerror “factual findings underlying a restitution order.” Id.\n       96\n         McNair’s PSI calculated this $67,980,043 as follows: (1) from July 2000 to October\n2002, RAST received $82,668,465 through County contracts and earned an average profit of\n17.5%, yielding $14,466,981 in profit; (2) from October 1999 to November 2002, FWDE\nreceived $19,647,100 in County contracts and earned an average profit of 12%, yielding\n$2,357,652 in profit; (3) from August 1999 to March 2002, PUGH received $109,015,665 in\n\n                                                 120\n\fbetween $50 million and $100 million, pursuant to §§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(M) and\n\n2C1.1(b)(2)(A).97 A total offense level of 36 and a criminal history category of I\n\nyielded an advisory guidelines range of 188-235 months’ imprisonment.\n\n       The PSI pointed out the total value of the bribes received by McNair was\n\n$889,962 and that restitution was mandatory, “pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3663A(a)(1).” The PSI reviewed McNair’s financial records and determined his\n\nnet worth was $497,163, calculated as follows:\n\n            Assets\n              Cash Assets\n                  * Checking Accounts                                  $379.00\n                  Insurance, Cash Surrender Value                   $10,521.00\n              Subtotal:                                             $10,900.00\n\n               Unencumbered Assets\n                 Motor Vehicles                                     $22,500.00\n               Subtotal:                                            $22,500.00\n\n               Equity in Other Assets\n                 * Residence                              $96,000.00\n                 McNair Investments (McNair Studio Bldg.)\n                                                        $379,455.00\n               Subtotal:                                $475,455.00\n\n\n\nCounty contracts and earned an average profit of 43.61%, yielding $47,541,731 in profit; (4)\nfrom November 2000 to March 2001, Dawson Engineering received $2,108,283 in County\ncontracts and earned an average profit of 12%, yielding $252,993 in profit; and (5) from\nFebruary 1999 to February 2002, USI received $28,005,724 in County contracts and earned an\naverage profit of 12%, yielding $3,360,686 in profit.\n       97\n       The PSI for McNair used the November 1, 2001 edition of the United States Sentencing\nCommission Guidelines Manual (the “Sentencing Manual”).\n\n                                             121\n\f            Total Assets                                            $508,855.00\n\n       Unsecured Debts\n               * Credit Card Debt                                     $11,242.00\n               * Internal Revenue Service                               $450.00\n         Total Unsecured Debts                                        $11,692.00\n\n       Net Worth                                                    $497,163.00[98]\n\nNotably, McNair’s net worth is largely due to his equity of $379,455 in McNair’s\n\nstudio building that was improved with the bribe money.99\n\n       The PSI stated that McNair’s monthly household income was $5,850, with\n\nmonthly expenses of $4,109, resulting in net monthly cash flow of $1,741,\n\ncalculated as follows:\n\n       Income\n            Defendant’s Social Security                                $1,779.00\n            Defendant’s Jefferson County Retirement                    $1,794.00\n            Spouse’s Social Security                                     $826.00\n            Spouse’s Teachers Retirement                               $1,451.00\n          Total Income:                                                $5,850.00\n\n       Necessary Living Expenses\n\n\n       98\n         The PSI states: “Items marked with an asterisk (*) represent [McNair’s] half of assets\nor obligations shared jointly with his spouse.”\n       99\n        The PSI’s net worth calculation does not include McNair’s partial ownership of certain\nArkansas property, which the PSI described as follows:\n      In addition to the above, the defendant indicated that he owns a one-twelfth share\n      (along with his siblings) of his parents’ home-place in Fordice, AR. The property\n      includes 50 acres, the parents’ original home, and a dwelling built in 2001. He\n      indicated that the value of the property is approximately $300,000, so his share\n      would be approximately $25,000.

McNair’s main unresolved\n\nobjections were his claims that the government failed to show: (1) that there was\n\nany victim owed restitution; and (2) that $889,962 was the amount of loss incurred\n\nby Jefferson County. In his written objections, however, McNair did not claim that\n\nhe lacked the financial ability to pay restitution at all or in the amount of\n\n$889,962.100\n\nB.     Sentencing Hearing\n\n       At sentencing, McNair again claimed the government failed to identify any\n\nvictim and failed to show any identifiable losses by Jefferson County or any\n\nconnection between the bribes and the County’s losses. McNair ultimately\n\n\n\n       100\n         McNair filed no objection to ¶¶ 154-157 of the PSI that set forth all of this financial\ninformation.\n\n                                                123\n\fconceded he had received $851,927 in things of value but only for purposes of the\n\nguidelines imprisonment calculations.101\n\n       McNair maintained that no restitution should be awarded, because the\n\ngovernment had not shown the County suffered a loss in that $851,927 amount or\n\nany amount for that matter. McNair’s counsel argued that under “Title 18, 3663,\n\nthe Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, that the Government is required to show\n\nlosses connected to victims, and that the amount of bribes paid to Mr. McNair does\n\nnot constitute losses to victims, and that there’s been no showing of that. . . .”\n\nMcNair contended “the amount of bribes paid to us is in no way connected to\n\nwhatever losses these victims may or may not have sustained.” McNair claimed\n\nthere was no showing that $851,927 was the loss to the County. Citing\n\n“3663(B)(ii)” twice, McNair also argued the district court should not order\n\nrestitution because the complexity and prolongation of the sentencing process in\n\nidentifying victims and determining the amount of losses attributed to those\n\nvictims outweighed the need to provide restitution. We pause to point out here that\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3663 is the Victim & Witness Protection Act (“VWPA”), not the\n\n\n       101\n          Contrary to the government’s arguments, McNair’s counsel repeatedly objected to the\nvictims’ identities and loss amounts for the basis of restitution. For example, McNair’s counsel\nstated: “We have agreed, for guidelines calculations, concerning that amount, but we do not\nbelieve that that is an appropriate figure or that there is any appropriate figure for restitution in\nthis case. And there is no basis legally to — for the Court to impose that kind of restitution order\nin this matter.”\n\n                                                124\n\fMandatory Victims Restitution Act (“MVRA”), and the substance of McNair’s\n\nargument comes from the VWPA.102 And as discussed later, the district court’s\n\njudgment effectively refers to the VWPA.\n\n       During the sentencing hearing, McNair again did not claim he lacked the\n\nfinancial ability to pay restitution at all or in the amount of $889,962 referenced in\n\nthe PSI. Ultimately, the district court found the Jefferson County Commission was\n\nthe identifiable victim and found the amount of loss suffered was $851,927,\n\nreasoning:\n\n       [C]ommon sense seems to me that, in any business, it doesn’t\n       intentionally go into business for the purpose of losing money; that the\n       evidence in all of these cases clearly shows that there was a great deal of\n       profit to be earned from these sewer contracts. And it seems to me,\n       commonsensically, that if you pay a certain amount of money as bribe\n       money, whether it’s cash or for services performed, you’re going to add\n       that back into the contracts or the bills submitted to the Jefferson County\n       Commission which pays the bills, in the first instance.\n\n       It is how they do business. Stated more clearly, it is a cost of business,\n       a direct cost of business that it paid and made up for, at some point, by\n       the Jefferson County Commission directly, and then indirectly to the rate\n       payers of Jefferson County.[103]\n\n\n       102\n          Section 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii) is part of the VWPA and provides:\n       (ii) To the extent that the court determines that the complication and prolongation of\n       the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution under\n       this section outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may\n       decline to make such an order.\n18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii). Although citing “3663(B)(ii),” McNair’s counsel argued the\nsubstance of § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n       103\n             Judge C. Linwood Smith sentenced McNair after Judge Robert B. Propst conducted the\n\n                                               125\n\fRecognizing the sewer construction contracts were awarded through a bidding\n\nprocess, the district court found that “the benefit to the bribe payors did not\n\nnecessarily accrue in the awarding of those contracts in the first instance, but,\n\nrather, the benefit accrued during the performance phase of the work that they were\n\nengaged to perform through change orders, through agreements to additional\n\npayments due to change orders, and things of that nature.” The district court also\n\nfound, “[a]t some point, any direct cost of business is going to be added back by\n\nthe bribe payors in the bills, the padded bills, that are submitted to the Jefferson\n\nCounty Commission,” and “therefore, the Jefferson County Commission, in the\n\nfirst instance, which paid those bids, is an identifiable victim.”\n\n       The district court reduced McNair’s total offense level by 10 levels from 36\n\nin the PSI to 26. Specifically, the district court reduced the 24-level enhancement\n\nin the PSI to a 14-level enhancement under §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) and 2B1.1(b)(1)(H).\n\nFor the § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) calculation, the district court used the $851,927 in bribes\n\nthe contractors made to McNair, not the $67,980,043 in net profits or benefits the\n\ncontractors received.104 After determining McNair’s offense level was 26 and\n\n\n\nMcNair trial.\n       104\n          The guidelines provide that for an offense where the benefit received or loss to the\ngovernment is more than $400,000 but not more than $1 million, a defendant’s offense level will\nincrease 14 levels. U.S.S.G. §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) (2001). Section 2C1.1 governs\nthe offense level for bribery of public officials but also uses, in part, the theft table in § 2B1.1.\n\n                                                 126\n\fcriminal history category was I, the district court determined that the advisory\n\nguidelines range was 63 to 70 months’ imprisonment.105\n\n       The district court sentenced McNair to 60 months’ imprisonment for each\n\ncount, to run concurrently, followed by two years’ supervised release, and ordered\n\nrestitution of $851,927 to the Jefferson County Commission and a special\n\nassessment of $1,200. Although the advisory guidelines fine range was $20,000 to\n\n$135,960,086, the district court did not impose any fine. After noting its review of\n\nthe PSI’s financial information, the district court stated it imposed restitution but\n\nno fine, as follows:\n\n       I reviewed the financial information provided in your presentence\n       investigation. And in reliance upon that information, I find that you do\n       not have the financial ability to pay even a minimum guideline fine.\n       Further, the imposition of such a fine would unduly burden your wife,\n       who is totally dependent upon you for not just physical and spiritual, but\n       financial support. Therefore, no fine will be imposed.\n\n       I do order, however, as I must order, that you pay to the United States a\n       special assessment in the aggregate amount of $1,200. You also are\n       ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $851,927. That is due to the\n       Jefferson County Commission at the address shown in paragraph 172 of\n       your presentence report.\n\n\n\n       105\n          McNair objected to the PSI’s failure to accord McNair a reduction for acceptance of\nresponsibility. The district court overruled that objection. McNair does not appeal the district\ncourt’s calculation of his advisory guidelines range as 63 to 70 months’ imprisonment.\n        In addition, the government has not challenged the district court’s use of the bribe\namounts, as opposed to the net profits amounts, as the basis for the enhancement calculation\nunder § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), nor McNair’s advisory guidelines range. So we assume for present\npurposes that the use of the bribe amounts and the guidelines range were proper.\n\n                                               127\n\fAt sentencing, the district court did not expressly state the statutory basis for its\n\norder of restitution. However, the district court’s judgment states that, “pursuant to\n\nthe Victim & Witness Restitution Act,” the court finds the Jefferson County\n\nCommission is a victim of McNair’s criminal conduct, has sustained a loss in the\n\namount of $851,927, and orders restitution in the amount of $851,927.106\n\nC.     Restitution for Victim’s Loss\n\n       The VWPA, 18 U.S.C. § 3663, provides that:\n\n       The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under\n       [Title 18] . . . other than an offense described in section 3663A(c),[ 107]\n       may order . . . that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such\n       offense, . . .\n\n       (B)(i) The court, in determining whether to order restitution under this\n       section, shall consider–\n              (I) the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of\n          the offense; and\n\n\n       106\n          We reject the government’s argument that the district court imposed restitution under\nthe MVRA. The PSI recommended the district court order restitution under “18 U.S.C.\n§ 3663A(a)(1),” which is the MVRA. Although referring to the MVRA, McNair’s attorney (in\nthe sentencing hearing) cited sections in the VWPA and made arguments premised on the\nsubstance of the VWPA (§ 3663). And the district court’s judgment references the “Victim &\nWitness Restitution Act.” Although this reference used “Restitution” instead of Victim &\nWitness Protection Act, it more closely resembles the VWPA than the MVRA. The government\nnever objected to that reference and never moved to correct it. Thus, we conclude the district\ncourt imposed restitution under the VWPA.\n       107\n           The VWPA, under which restitution is discretionary, excepts offenses in § 3663A(c),\nwhich is the MVRA, under which restitution is mandatory. We sua sponte note there is a\npotential issue of whether bribery is “an offense against property” covered by § 3663A(c) and\nwhether the MVRA applies to bribery crimes. 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c). Nothing herein should be\nread as implying the answer to that question. We review the VWPA only because that is the\nonly thing the district court referenced in McNair’s sentence.\n\n                                              128\n\f            (II) the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs\n         and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant’s dependents,\n         and such other factors as the court deems appropriate. . . .\n\n      (2) For the purposes of this section, the term “victim” means a person\n      directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an\n      offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an\n      offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of\n      criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant’s criminal\n      conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3663. “The government bears the burden of demonstrating the amount\n\nof the victim’s loss by a preponderance of the evidence.” United States v. Futrell,\n\n209 F.3d 1286, 1290 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e), which states,\n\n“Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the\n\ncourt by the preponderance of the evidence.”). However, “[t]he burden of\n\ndemonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of\n\nthe defendant’s dependents shall be on the defendant.” 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e); see\n\nUnited States v. Twitty, 107 F.3d 1482, 1494 n.14 (11th Cir. 1997) (stating the\n\nburden rests on the defendant to demonstrate lack of financial resources by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence).\n\nD.    County’s Losses\n\n      McNair argues that the government failed to prove any losses suffered by\n\nthe County. We disagree. For starters, the evidence showed McNair received\n\n$851,927 in goods, services, labor, materials, and money as a result of the bribery\n\n                                         129\n\fscheme. Further, during the same time period, the contractor-defendants received\n\nhundreds of millions of dollars in payments under their County contracts and made\n\nmillions of dollars in profits.108\n\n       And the district court did not clearly err in finding that the contractors\n\nessentially recouped their bribe money by adding it back to their sewer and\n\nengineering contract bills as a cost of doing business with the County. See United\n\nStates v. DeVegter, 439 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir. 2006) (“Assuming the bribe\n\nachieves its intended result, the benefit would usually exceed the bribe.”); see also\n\nFutrell, 209 F.3d at 1292 (concluding the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin ordering restitution under the MVRA based on “approximation” of loss resulting\n\nfrom defendants’ fraud).\n\n       The district court’s determination is consistent with Supreme Court\n\nprecedent stating that when a public official acquires an ill-gotten benefit as a\n\nresult of his office, the government suffers losses in that amount. See United\n\nStates v. Carter, 217 U.S. 286, 305-06, 30 S. Ct. 515, 520 (1910).109\n\n\n       108\n             See supra note 96.\n       109\n          In Carter, the Supreme Court stated:\n       It is not enough for one occupying a confidential relation to another, who is shown\n       to have secretly received a benefit from the opposite party, to say, “. . . you cannot\n       show that you have sustained any loss by my conduct.” Such an agent has the power\n       to conceal his fraud and hide the injury done his principal. It would be a dangerous\n       precedent to lay down as law that unless some affirmative fraud or loss can be\n       shown, the agent may hold on to any secret benefit he may be able to make out of his\n\n                                                130\n\f        McNair next contends the district court erred by failing to consider his\n\nfinancial ability to pay restitution and by not making an explicit finding that he had\n\nthe financial ability to pay restitution of $851,927. We can locate no place in this\n\nvoluminous record where McNair claimed in the district court that he lacked the\n\nfinancial ability to pay restitution or the $889,962 amount of restitution\n\nrecommended in the PSI and sought by the government. See Jones, 289 F.3d at\n\n1265. Because McNair raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review it\n\nonly for plain error. United States v. Rodriguez, 398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.\n\n2005). We may not correct an error the appellant failed to raise in the district court\n\nunless there is: “‘(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.’”\n\nId. (quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S. Ct. 1781, 1785\n\n(2002)). If the preceding three conditions are met, we may exercise discretion to\n\ncorrect a forfeited error, but only if “(4) the error seriously affects the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id. (quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n        agency. The larger interests of public justice will not tolerate, under any\n        circumstances, that a public official shall retain any profit or advantage which he\n        may realize through the acquirement of an interest in conflict with his fidelity as an\n        agent. If he takes any gift, gratuity, or benefit in violation of his duty, or acquires\n        any interest adverse to his principal, without a full disclosure, it is a betrayal of his\n        trust and a breach of confidence, and he must account to his principal for all he has\n        received.\nCarter, 217 U.S. at 305-06, 30 S. Ct. at 520.\n\n                                                  131\n\f       McNair has not shown plain error for several reasons. First, “[d]istrict\n\ncourts are not obliged to make explicit factual findings of a defendant’s ability to\n\npay restitution if the record provides an adequate basis for review.” United States\n\nv. Dabbs, 134 F.3d 1071, 1084 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Twitty, 107 F.3d at\n\n1493); accord United States v. Fuentes, 107 F.3d 1515, 1529 n.27 (11th Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Remillong, 55 F.3d 572, 574-78 (11th Cir. 1995); United States v.\n\nHairston, 888 F.2d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir. 1989) (stating, “[i]f the record provides\n\nan adequate basis for . . . review, the court need not assign specific reasons for its\n\ndecision to order full restitution. If the record is insufficient, reasons must be\n\nassigned.”) (quotation marks omitted).110 “‘In order to warrant a reversal of the\n\nrestitution order, the challenging party must show that the record is devoid of any\n\nevidence that the defendant is able to satisfy the restitution order.’” Dabbs, 134\n\nF.3d at 1084 (quoting United States v. Davis, 117 F.3d 459, 463 (11th Cir. 1997)).\n\nHowever, “we will not uphold the district court’s exercise of discretion if the\n\nrecord is devoid of any evidence that the defendant is able to satisfy the restitution\n\norder.” Remillong, 55 F.3d at 574.\n\n       Second, the record is not devoid of any evidence of McNair’s ability to\n\n\n\n       110\n           Since 1989 this Court has agreed “with the courts that have declined to adopt a rigid\nrule requiring district courts to make findings of fact whenever they impose an order of\nrestitution under the VWPA.” Hairston, 888 F.2d at 1352.\n\n                                                132\n\fsatisfy the restitution order. The PSI set forth McNair’s finances in detail, the\n\ndistrict court said it had reviewed that financial information, and McNair did not\n\ncontest the facts as to his finances. There is no dispute that McNair has equity of\n\n$379,455 in his studio building, which was built in part using the bribe money.\n\nThe studio value could reduce the restitution from $851,927 to $472,472.\n\n      In addition, McNair has a net cash flow of $1,741 per month, which is about\n\nthe size of his monthly Jefferson County retirement check of $1,794. That\n\nretirement check alone permits McNair to pay $21,528 annually toward the\n\nrestitution. Five years of $21,528 payments annually would equal over $100,000\n\nin restitution. The unique problem in this case, however, is that McNair is now 84\n\nyears old.111 Although the PSI states McNair “reports no current medical problems\n\nor prescription medications taken on a regular basis,” it would take McNair 21.94\n\nyears at $21,528 per year to pay the remaining $472,472 left in restitution.\n\nTherefore, the record does not necessarily show that McNair has the financial\n\nability to pay the full $851,927 in restitution.\n\n      Nonetheless, under the fourth prong of plain error review, we conclude any\n\nerror does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings because (1) McNair, not the government, has the burden to prove lack\n\n\n\n      111\n            The PSI states McNair’s date of birth is November 22, 1925.\n\n                                                133\n\fof financial ability to pay the restitution in full; (2) the district court did not impose\n\nany fine but only restitution; (3) McNair does not dispute that he received\n\n$851,927 in goods, services, materials, labor, and other things of value; (4) no one,\n\nnot even the district court if we remanded for further findings, knows how long\n\nMcNair will live and continue to receive his monthly Jefferson County pension and\n\nthus be able to pay some restitution each month; and (5) the party owed this\n\nrestitution is the same party currently paying McNair $1,749 per month, making it\n\neminently fair to recapture these payments as restitution for as long as they are\n\nmade. Given all of the unique circumstances in this case, McNair has not shown\n\nplain error in the district court’s restitution order.\n\n       McNair also challenges the restitution order on the ground that United States\n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), requires that the factual predicate\n\nfor restitution be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. McNair’s Booker\n\nchallenge is foreclosed by our precedent. United States v. Williams, 445 F.3d\n\n1302, 1310 (11th Cir. 2006) (“Booker does not apply to restitution orders.”),\n\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. Lewis, 492 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th\n\nCir. 2007). We thus reject this argument.112\n\n\n       112\n          McNair objected to this statement in the PSI: “Theo Lawson, County Attorney for\nJefferson County, AL, appeared at the sentencing in U.S. v. Dougherty, (05-61, 05-544) and\nindicated that the county requests restitution in each of these cases on the amount of the bribes.”\nOn appeal McNair claims the PSI’s inclusion of this “testimony” violated his right to\n\n                                                134\n\f       For the first time on appeal, McNair also claims the district court erred in\n\nordering any restitution because co-defendant Roland Pugh was not ordered to pay\n\nrestitution. We review this claim for plain error. See United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2005). Seven of McNair’s co-defendants were\n\nordered to pay restitution, to wit: PUGH ($239,652), Bobby Rast ($141,000),\n\nDanny Rast ($141,000), RAST ($141,000), Swann ($355,533), FWDE ($225,149),\n\nand Dougherty ($225,149). McNair has shown no plain error in this regard.113\n\n       For all these reasons, we affirm the restitution order as to McNair.\n\n                              XIII. SWANN’S SENTENCE\n\n       Swann was sentenced to 102 months’ imprisonment, followed by three\n\nyears’ supervised release, on one bribery conspiracy count (Count 51), six\n\nsubstantive bribery counts (Counts 52-54, 57, 58, and 60), and eleven counts of\n\nhonest services mail fraud (Counts 90-100). The district court ordered Swann to\n\npay restitution of $355,533 and a fine of $250,000. On appeal, Swann challenges\n\n\n\n\nconfrontation in the Sixth Amendment. We disagree. The district court never mentioned\nLawson, let alone relied on his statement as the basis for restitution. In any event, this Court has\nheld that “Crawford dealt with trial rights and we see no reason to extend Crawford to sentencing\nproceedings. The right to confrontation is not a sentencing right.” United States v. Cantellano,\n430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir. 2005).\n       113\n          McNair received no fine while some co-defendants had significant fines, such as\nRoland Pugh ($250,000), PUGH ($19.4 million), Bobby Rast ($2.5 million), Danny Rast ($1\nmillion), RAST ($1,702,500), Swann ($250,000), FWDE ($3,830,760), and Dougherty\n($750,000).\n\n                                                135\n\fthe imprisonment and his fine but not the restitution.\n\nA.     Presentence Report\n\n       The PSI: (1) assigned Swann a base offense level of 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1 (2003); (2) added 2 levels because Swann’s conduct involved more than\n\none bribe, pursuant to § 2C1.1(b)(1); (3) added 22 levels because the net profit or\n\nbenefit ($42,460,880)114 to the contractors in connection with their bribes of Swann\n\nwas between $20 million and $50 million, pursuant to §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) and\n\n2B1.1(b)(1)(L); and (4) added 2 levels for obstruction of justice, pursuant to\n\n§ 3C1.1.115 A total offense level of 36 and a criminal history category of I yielded\n\nan advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ imprisonment.\n\n       The PSI provided a detailed financial analysis of Swann’s assets, including\n\nhis cash, checking and savings accounts, savings bonds, deferred compensation\n\naccount, debt, investments, income, and living expenses. The PSI reported Swann\n\nhad $118,194 in assets, including $109,380 in deferred compensation, $95,000 in\n\n\n       114\n          Swann’s PSI calculated this $42,460,880 in profit as follows: (1) from September\n1998 to October 2002, RAST received $127,182,375 through County contracts and earned an\naverage profit of 17.5%, yielding $22,256,740 in profit; (2) from September 1998 to November\n2002, FWDE received $23,884,498 through County contracts and earned an average profit of\n12%, yielding $2,866,139 in profit; and (3) PUGH’s total profits for 2001 and 2002 amounted to\n$17,338,000.\n        We recognize that McNair’s PSI showed total contractor profits of $67,980,043, but\nMcNair’s PSI included $3,360,686 in USI profits and $47,541,731 in PUGH profits (based on a\nlonger time span of almost four years from August 1999 to March 2002). See supra note 96.\n       115\n             The PSI for Swann used the November 1, 2003 edition of the Sentencing Manual.\n\n                                                136\n\fdebt (taxes and attorneys’ fees), and a net worth of $23,194. The PSI stated\n\nSwann’s monthly income was $6,729 ($6,604 in Jefferson County pension and\n\n$125 salary for niece’s trust fund). Thus, at the time of the PSI, Swann had an\n\nannual income of $80,748.\n\n       The PSI reported that Swann’s total monthly expenses were $6,971,\n\ncalculated as follows:\n\n       Necessary Living Expenses\n         Home Mortgage/Equity Line (645 Winwood)                     $2,321.00\n         Home Mortgage/Equity Line (641 Winwood)                     $1,201.00\n         Groceries/Supplies/Transportation                           $1,435.00\n                (Includes all credit card purchases\n                other than non-copay medical\n                expenses.)\n         Utilities                                                     $452.00\n         Telephone                                                     $118.00\n         Auto Insurance                                                $122.00\n         Life Insurance                                               $395.00\n         Home Maintenance Insurance                                     $36.00\n         Clothing                                                       $20.00\n         Medical                                                       $488.00\n         Printing/Copying/Postage                                       $60.00\n         Dry Cleaning                                                   $10.00\n         Pest Control/Termite Bond                                      $48.00\n         OTC Medications/Personal Grooming                            $122.00\n         Lawn Maintenance                                             $120.00\n         Internet Service                                               $23.00\n       Total Expenses:                                               $6,971.00[116]\n\n       The PSI noted (1) Swann’s wife was retired from Bellsouth, (2) their newly\n\n\n       116\n         Swann also submitted other expenses as “necessary,” which the PSI did not include in\nthe above calculations as “necessary”: meals out $75; entertainment $30; and newspaper $12.40.\n\n                                             137\n\fremodeled home at 645 Winwood Drive was in her name, and (3) she owned their\n\nformer home, at 641 Winwood Drive two doors down, jointly with her mother and\n\npaid that mortgage.117 According to the PSI, Swann’s wife had refused to provide\n\nany additional financial information for the PSI. Swann claimed he had no\n\nknowledge of the value of his wife’s investments, nor of the income generated\n\nfrom her investments or retirement.\n\n       In calculating Swann’s fine under 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d),118 the PSI stated the\n\n“gross loss” amount was the $42,460,880 benefit the contractors received. Based\n\non this information, the PSI determined the guidelines fine range was $20,000 to\n\n$84,921,760 (i.e., double the gross loss amount pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2).\n\nThe PSI stated: “Based on his financial condition it appears that the defendant\n\n[Swann] could pay a fine within the guideline range or make a lump-sum payment\n\ntoward restitution shortly after sentencing through use of liquid assets.” The PSI\n\nnoted that Swann’s “future ability to make payments on an installment basis will\n\n\n\n       117\n         Swann filed no objections to ¶¶ 153-159 of the PSI that set forth all of this financial\ninformation.\n       118\n          Section 3571(d) provides:\n       If any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in\n       pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not\n       more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss, unless\n       imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the\n       sentencing process.\n18 U.S.C. § 3571(d).\n\n                                                138\n\fbe dependant [sic] on several factors including the sentence in this case, his family\n\nsituation, and his ability to contain monthly expenses.”\n\n       The PSI stated that restitution was mandatory under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3663A(a)(1) (the MVRA) and that the County had requested restitution.\n\n       Swann objected to the 22-level increase to his offense level under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), arguing his offense level should be based on the amount of\n\nbribes ($355,533) rather than the net profits or benefits ($42,460,880) the\n\ncontractors received. Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) provides:\n\n       If the value of the payment, the benefit received or to be received in\n       return for the payment, or the loss to the government from the offense,\n       whichever is greatest (i) exceeded $2,000 but did not exceed $5,000,\n       increase by 1 level; or (ii) exceeded $5,000, increase by the number of\n       levels from the table in §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud)\n       corresponding to that amount.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) (2003).119 Swann argued there was no evidence of a\n\ncausal connection linking any bribe to the award of any contract, and therefore, the\n\n22-level adjustment under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) was improper. Even if a quid pro quo\n\nis not required for a § 666 conviction, Swann claimed evidence of a quid pro quo\n\nwas necessary under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) to increase his offense level.\n\nB.     Sentencing Hearing\n\n\n       119\n          The guidelines provide that for an offense where the benefit received or loss to the\ngovernment is more than $20 million but not more than $50 million, a defendant’s offense level\nwill increase by 22 levels. U.S.S.G. §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2B1.1(b)(1)(L).\n\n                                              139\n\f       At sentencing, Swann objected to the PSI on the ground that co-defendants\n\nRAST, Bobby Rast, and Danny Rast’s offense levels were based on the amount of\n\nbribes given, not the financial benefit or profit to them. Swann also objected to\n\nany obstruction of justice enhancement. The district court sustained Swann’s\n\nobjection to the obstruction enhancement.120\n\n       The district court, however, concluded the benefit, not bribe, amount should\n\nbe used under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) and found the evidence was “absolutely clear that\n\nthere is at least 20 million dollars that was benefit” to the bribe-payor contractors.\n\nAs support for the $20 million figure, the district court cited instances where\n\nSwann (1) decided not to invoke the performance bond against RAST, (2) allowed\n\nRAST to rebid the Valley Creek job for an additional $23.927 million, and (3) was\n\ninvolved in granting RAST a $2.677 million change order when RAST’s boring\n\nmachine became stuck. The district court found that a preponderance of the\n\nevidence established that the $20 million benefit to the bribe-payors “was a direct\n\nresult of that influence of [RAST’s] bribes.” The court also pointed out that Swann\n\n\n       120\n           Because some of Swann’s co-defendants were sentenced under an earlier guidelines\nedition and that edition would result in a lower guidelines range for him, Swann urged the court\nto use the earlier edition to avoid a sentencing disparity with his co-defendants. The district\ncourt overruled that objection.\n        On appeal Swann does not challenge the applicability of the 2003 guidelines edition to\nthe calculations of his advisory guidelines range. Rather, as discussed later, Swann claims his\nsentence is substantively unreasonable because the use of different editions as to co-defendants\ncaused disparities in his and his co-defendants’ sentences that are unwarranted. We address that\nissue later.\n\n                                              140\n\fgranted PUGH’s joint venture a 180-day extension just days after PUGH’s Yessick\n\nhired a landscaper for Swann’s property, saving PUGH’s joint venture $180,000 in\n\nliquidated damages. At sentencing, the district court expressly found a direct\n\nconnection between the bribes to Swann and the financial benefit to the bribe-\n\npayor contractors, stating:\n\n      I think it is absolutely clear that there is at least 20 million dollars that\n      was benefit, for instance, to [RAST], two change orders being 2.677\n      million of the digging out of the boring machine and pulling out a boring\n      machine and rebid of that job, 23.927 million. The testimony as I recall\n      it at trial and the testimony that was presented today, I conclude, based\n      on the burden of proof that’s required, not beyond a reasonable doubt but\n      by a preponderance of the evidence, that that is due to be calculated at\n      2B1.1 as a gain of over 20 million dollars, that because of the decision\n      by Mr. Swann that I believe was a result of the bribes and stuff that was\n      provided him by RAST, I think that that was a direct result of that\n      influence of those bribes. And I am not going to go through the others.\n      Like for instance, the extensions, just one example is with regard to\n      exhibit 36, the 180 extension that was granted to PUGH. A thousand\n      dollars a day is what I recall the evidence to be that it would have been\n      if they weren’t granted that extension and that’s $180,000. I am not even\n      necessarily having to go to the aspect of whether or not because Mr.\n      Swann was Mr. Wilson’s supervisor the effect of the contracts or the\n      approval of the committee because I find I am going to, for calculation\n      of fine purposes, set that amount at 20 million and one dollars. More\n      than 20 million, I am going to set it at 20 million and one dollars as\n      clearly – in fact, actually I think I figured it at 26 million at the bottom\n      end, but I am going to set it at 20 million and one dollars for the purpose\n      of calculating the fine range, and I will ask him that you do that for me,\n      and we’ll need to recalculate the other.\n\n      The district court found that Swann’s base offense level was 10, added 2\n\nlevels because Swann’s offenses involved multiple bribes, and added 22 levels\n\n                                          141\n\fbecause the benefit to the bribe-payor contractors was between $20 million and\n\n$50 million, resulting in a total offense level of 34. See U.S.S.G.\n\n§§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2B1.1(b)(1). This total offense level of 34 and a criminal\n\nhistory category of I yielded an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months’\n\nimprisonment.\n\n       In considering the § 3553 factors, the district court found that Swann (1) was\n\nnot credible in stating his wife was the one responsible and he did not know that\n\nthese contractors were doing the work and what was going on, (2) had “not\n\nindicated any remorse whatsoever,” and (3) refused to accept responsibility. The\n\ndistrict court also considered that it was “bribery on a large scale of a public\n\nofficial” that had affected many people. The court noted “the need to reflect the\n\nseriousness of this offense and to promote respect for the law and to provide just\n\npunishment for this offense.” The court also commented that, because Swann held\n\na position of public trust, he was different than the contractor-defendants that were\n\nbribing him. The district court stated it had considered all of the § 3553 factors.\n\nCiting Swann’s “history” and “character,” the district court varied downward from\n\nthe 151 to 188 months’ range and imposed a sentence of 102 months’\n\nimprisonment, followed by 3 years’ supervised release.121\n\n\n       121\n        As to Counts 51 and 90 to 100, the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months’\nimprisonment, to run concurrently. As to Counts 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, and 60, the district court\n\n                                               142\n\f       Importantly, the district court also stated that, even if it had adopted Swann’s\n\nview that the U.S.S.G. § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) calculation should be based on the bribe\n\namount Swann received (instead of the net benefit to the contractors) and even if\n\nSwann’s total offense level was 24 and his guidelines range was 51 to 63 months,\n\nit would nonetheless vary upward on Swann’s sentence, explaining:\n\n       [C]ounsel has urged me to utilize the guideline range that would result\n       from considering the bribes of $355,533 in calculating your sentencing\n       range and indicated that if I used that, it would result in a guideline\n       offense level, criminal offense level of 24 when combined with a\n       criminal history category of roman numeral one would result in\n       imprisonment range of 51 to 63 months. I am going to state for the\n       record that if I used that, I would nonetheless vary upward because I\n       would believe that would not be sufficient to account for the other\n       factors in [18 U.S.C. § 3553] that I am charged with the responsibility of\n       weighing, including the nature and circumstances of this particular\n       offense, as well as the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\n       provide respect for law. I would have varied upwards, in other words,\n       on that sentence. So if the Eleventh Circuit has any question about that\n       when they get this on appeal which I suppose they will, if they ask or\n       wonder what I would have done had I went that way, that’s what I would\n       have done. I believe that’s appropriate and I have given that weight. I\n       have actually considered that, and I started to just go ahead and do that.\n       But I thought it appropriate in this instance because I think it is very\n       clear that at least the 23 million dollars that I discussed earlier was a\n       correct calculation.\n\n(Emphasis added). Although the district court did not say the precise words — “I\n\nwould impose the same 102 months sentence” — the record is patently clear that is\n\n\n\nimposed a sentence of 102 months’ imprisonment, to run concurrently. The sentences for all 18\ncounts thus run concurrently.\n\n                                             143\n\fwhat the district court meant.\n\n       As to restitution, Swann disputed that the amount of the bribes paid was\n\n$355,533, but conceded that, if restitution was owed, it should be based on the\n\namount of bribes paid. Based on the evidence, the district court found the total\n\nbribe amount Swann received was $355,533. The district court rejected Swann’s\n\nargument that restitution should be only the total $93,680 bribe amount referenced\n\nin the conviction counts (Counts 52-54, 57-58, 60, 90-100) that the jury found\n\nSwann received beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court ordered Swann to\n\npay restitution of $355,533122 to the “Jefferson County Commission.”\n\n       As to the fine, Swann pointed out he “has no money,” that his house was\n\ntransferred to his wife’s name before he became aware of the subpoenas in the\n\ninvestigation, and that he lost the respect of his community and thereby lost his\n\nability to earn a living. Swann argued for a reduced fine but did not propose any\n\nspecific fine amount.\n\n\n\n       122\n          This $355,533 consisted of:\n       (1) $149,102 from PUGH ($7,422 for waterfall and koi pond, $1,000 in gift certificates to\nAlabama Book Smith, and $140,680 in landscaping by Guthrie);\n       (2) $55,885 from RAST ($4,441 for concrete work; $3,535 for flooring; $1,054 in brick\nwork; $8,940 in plumbing; $9,733 for painting; $6,300 to Derek Houston for supervision;\n$18,867 in labor for miscellaneous employees; and $3,015 for Swann’s trip to England and\nScotland); and\n       (3) $150,929 from FWDE ($28,839 to Stanger for supervision; $94,090 to Hendon for\nsupervision; and $28,000 to Dudley Davis for framing). The sentencing court and its judgment\nuse $355,533, and we do too. But these amounts total $355,933.\n\n                                              144\n\f       After determining the advisory guidelines fine range was $17,500 to\n\n$40,000,002, the court imposed a $250,000 fine and a $1,800 special assessment.\n\nAs to the $250,000 fine, the district court stated:\n\n       You are ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $250,000. I don’t know\n       whether that’s collectable or not. I don’t think it is, but I think it’s\n       appropriate considering the circumstances.\n\nC.     Guidelines Range Calculations\n\n       On appeal Swann claims the district court improperly calculated his\n\nguidelines range because “[t]he court utilized a ‘net benefit’ approach instead of\n\nthe amount of the alleged bribes in calculating the base offense level.” This is a\n\nchallenge to the procedural reasonableness of Swann’s 102 months’ imprisonment\n\nsentence.123\n\n       As noted earlier, the bribery offense level is calculated using the greater of\n\nthe value of the bribe payment or the benefit received in return. See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A). “The value of ‘the benefit received or to be received’ means the\n\n\n\n\n       123\n           In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we apply an abuse-of-discretion\nstandard using a two-step process. United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179, 1189-90 (11th Cir.\n2008) (relying on Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007)). First, we\nlook at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as\nmiscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to\nconsider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,\nor failing to explain adequately the sentence. Pugh, 515 F.3d at 1190. Then we look at whether\nthe sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. Id.\n\n                                               145\n\fnet value of such benefit.” § 2C1.1 cmt. n.2.124 “The net value of the improper\n\nbenefit need only be estimated, and the bribe amount should be used only when the\n\nnet value cannot be estimated.” DeVegter, 439 F.3d at 1303. The net value “need\n\nonly be a reasonable estimate given the information available to the government.”\n\nUnited States v. Cabrera, 172 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir. 1999).125\n\n       On appeal Swann does not claim that the bribe amount ($355,533) he\n\nreceived was greater than the net benefit amount (over $20 million) the contractor-\n\ndefendants received.126 Rather, Swann argues that, to use the net benefit approach,\n\nthe government first must show a connection (i.e., a quid pro quo) between a\n\n\n       124\n          The Commentary to § 2C1.1 gives the following examples of net value: “(1) A\ngovernment employee, in return for a $500 bribe, reduces the price of a piece of surplus property\noffered for sale by the government from $10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is\n$8,000. (2) A $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a\nbribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000.” U.S.S.G. § 2C1.1 cmt. n.2.\n        The Commentary to § 2C1.1 also provides: “[F]or deterrence purposes, the punishment\nshould be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is\nhigher.” Id. cmt. Background.\n       125\n          In United States v. DeVegter, 439 F.3d at 1304, this Court adopted the Fifth Circuit’s\napproach to calculating net value under § 2C1.1 as set forth in United States v. Landers, 68 F.3d\n882 (5th Cir. 1995). The Fifth Circuit in Landers concluded that the profit on a contract, not the\ngross revenue or value, is to be used to determine net value. We stated in DeVegter, “[w]e agree\nwith the Fifth Circuit’s approach [in Landers] which subtracts direct costs, but not indirect costs,\nfrom profits to determine the net improper benefit.” DeVegter, 439 F.3d at 1304.\n       126\n           Swann’s appeal brief refers to the $20 million as the “net benefit” and does not argue\nthat the district court erred by using $20 million in its calculation of net benefit. Although the\ndistrict court’s finding that the benefit was $20 million to the contractor-defendants appears to be\nbased on gross revenue received by the contractor-defendants and not their net profit, other\nportions of the trial record amply support total profits in excess of $20 million to the contractor-\ndefendants RAST, PUGH, and FWDE, and thus a net benefit in excess of $20 million. This may\nbe why no remand was requested on this issue.\n\n                                                146\n\fparticular bribe and a particular contract or action by a public official. Swann\n\nclaims the government’s evidence failed to show the requisite causal connection.\n\n      In this regard, Swann first argues there is no connection between the bribes\n\nhe received and the contractors’ revenue because he had no authority to award the\n\nsewer or engineering contracts. Alternatively, Swann claims, “there was no tie or\n\nconnection of any kind between any alleged bribe and any contract awarded even if\n\nAppellant Swann could have influenced the award of the contract.” Therefore,\n\nSwann says, “the proper loss amount to be utilized under § 2C1.1 was the amount\n\nof the alleged bribes paid to Appellant Swann and the court erred in failing to\n\nutilize said amount.” Swann points out that had the $355,533 bribe amount been\n\nused (as opposed to the $20 million benefit amount), the district court would have\n\nadded only 12 levels (not 22) under § 2C1.1, resulting in a total adjusted offense\n\nlevel of 24 (not 34).\n\n      This Court has not addressed what type of connection under\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) the government must establish between the bribe given and the\n\nbenefit received. Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) does speak in terms of “the value of . . .\n\nthe benefit received or to be received in return for the payment . . . .” U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A). Other circuits have held that the threshold for establishing a\n\ncausal connection under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) is low. See United States v. Sapoznik,\n\n\n\n                                          147\n\f161 F.3d 1117, 1119 (7th Cir. 1998) (concluding that “[t]o show that the bribes\n\nbenefitted the people paying them [the bar owners/illegal gambling], . . . it is\n\nenough for the government to show that the bribes facilitated the gambling\n\noperations”); United States v. Kinter, 235 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 2000) (stating\n\n“[t]he threshold for the causation inquiry for § 2C1.1 calculations is relatively\n\nlow”). In Sapoznik, the Seventh Circuit explained that the question of causation\n\nbetween the bribe and the benefit is different from the question of quantification of\n\nthe actual benefit received, concluding the government had established a causal\n\nconnection between the bribe and the benefit even though it had not shown the\n\nprecise amount of the benefit to the bribe-payor. Sapoznik, 161 F.3d at 1119. And\n\nthe bribes need only contribute or facilitate the business activity involved. Id.\n\n       Here, given the wealth of evidence in the record, we readily conclude the\n\ndistrict court did not clearly err in finding that the benefits the contractors received\n\n(such as the RAST revenue from the $2.6 million change order, the RAST job\n\nrebid for an additional $23,837,350, and the PUGH time extension on the Vestavia\n\nTrunk Sewer Replacement project) were a result of the corrupt bribes to Swann.\n\nThis amply satisfies any causal connection requirement in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).127\n\n\n       127\n          We review the district court’s findings of fact in sentencing for clear error. DeVegter,\n439 F.3d at 1303. We do not find clear error unless “‘we are left with a definite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . [T]he clear error standard is purposefully\ndeferential to the district court, . . . [but r]eview for clear error does not mean no review.’” Id.\n\n                                                 148\n\fAccordingly, we find no reversible error in the district court’s calculations adding\n\n22 levels under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) to Swann’s offense level.\n\n       The district court alternatively stated that even if it used the bribe amount\n\napproach and not the net benefit approach, it would vary upward from the lower\n\nrange (51 to 63 months) urged by Swann based on “other factors in 18 USC\n\nSection 3553 that I am charged with the responsibility of weighing.” Therefore,\n\nwe also conclude any error in the guidelines calculations as to Swann was\n\nharmless. See United States v. Barner, 572 F.3d 1239, 1248 (11th Cir. 2009)\n\n(“Where a district judge clearly states that he would impose the same sentence,\n\neven if he erred in calculating the guidelines, then any error in the calculation is\n\nharmless.”); United States v. Dean, 517 F.3d 1224, 1232 (11th Cir. 2008), aff’d,\n\nDean v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 1849 (2009); United States v. Keene, 470 F.3d\n\n1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\nD.     Substantive Reasonableness\n\n       Swann also argues his 102-month sentence was substantively unreasonable\n\nbecause the district court impermissibly considered that (1) Swann showed no\n\nremorse, and (2) because he was a public official, Swann was more culpable than\n\nthe contractors and, without his conduct, the bribe-payors could not have\n\n\n(quoting United States v. Crawford, 407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir. 2005)). We review\nquestions of law arising under the federal Sentencing Guidelines de novo. Id.\n\n                                             149\n\fcommitted the crime.128\n\n       This Court considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed\n\nby inquiring whether the sentence is supported by the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors.\n\nGall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S. Ct. 586, 600 (2007).129\n\n       The district court need not discuss each of the § 3553(a) factors. United\n\nStates v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir. 2005) (“[N]othing in Booker or\n\nelsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly\n\nconsidered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section\n\n3553(a) factors.”) (quotation marks omitted). The district court’s acknowledgment\n\nthat it considered the defendant’s arguments and the factors in § 3553(a) is\n\nsufficient. Id.\n\n       The district court’s consideration of Swann’s lack of remorse was not\n\nimproper. A district court is permitted to consider lack of remorse in its § 3553(a)\n\n\n       128\n         Swann claims these were improper factors (1) for not varying even lower than 102\nmonths from the 151 to 188 months guidelines range and alternatively (2) for varying upward to\n102 months from the 51 to 63 months guidelines range.\n       129\n          The § 3553(a) factors are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for\ndeterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed\neducational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the\nSentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9)\nthe need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to\nvictims. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). We review de novo whether the district court considered an\nimpermissible factor. United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, 524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.\n2008).\n\n                                                 150\n\fanalysis as to several factors, such as the characteristics of a defendant, the need to\n\npromote respect for the law, and the need to protect society. See United States v.\n\nKapordelis, 569 F.3d 1291, 1318 (11th Cir. 2009) (stating “district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion by considering . . . [defendant’s] lack of remorse” and\n\naffirming where district court found “upward variance was necessary to protect\n\nsociety because it was unlikely that [the defendant] would be rehabilitated given\n\nhis attitude and lack of remorse”), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1315 (2010); United\n\nStates v. Cruzado-Laureano, 527 F.3d 231, 236-37 (1st Cir. 2008) (upholding\n\nconsideration of lack of remorse as a permissible factor under § 3553(a)(1) as to\n\nthe characteristics of a defendant, under § 3553(a)(2)(A) to promote respect for the\n\nlaw, and under § 3553(a)(2)(C) to protect the public from future crimes of the\n\ndefendant). The district court also did not err in considering Swann was a public\n\nofficial, another characteristic of the defendant. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).\n\n      Swann further argues there was an unwarranted disparity between his 102-\n\nmonth sentence and those of his co-defendants Bobby Rast (51 months), Danny\n\nRast (41 months), and Dougherty (51 months). Swann claims Bobby and Danny\n\nRast received lower sentences because the district court sentenced them using the\n\nbribe amount (not the net benefit amount) in calculating their guidelines ranges\n\n\n\n\n                                          151\n\funder § 2C1.1.130 Swann argues that in using the net benefit in his case, the district\n\ncourt created sentencing disparity with similarly situated co-defendants because it\n\nhad utilized different methods to calculate the guidelines range for various co-\n\ndefendants. This ignores a number of factors that differentiate Swann from these\n\nparticular co-defendants: (1) Swann was a public official and the private\n\ncontractors were not, (2) Swann took bribes not just from the Rast defendants but\n\nalso from the Pugh and Dougherty defendants, (3) the district court found Swann\n\nnot credible in stating he did not understand the home remodeling work was\n\nintended to influence him, and (4) Swann showed a lack of remorse. Simply put,\n\nSwann has not proved he and these particular co-defendants are similarly situated.\n\n       As to FWDE and Dougherty, Swann also argues they received lower\n\nsentences because the district court applied an earlier edition of the sentencing\n\nguidelines. As to FWDE, Swann is incorrect because the PSI and the district court\n\napplied the 2003 guidelines to calculate FWDE’s sentence. As to Dougherty, the\n\n2000 guidelines were used. Under the 2000 guidelines, a $20 million net benefit\n\nresulted in a 16-level increase, rather than the 22-level increase in the 2003\n\nversion. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(Q), (R) (2000) with § 2B1.1(b)(1)(L),\n\n\n\n       130\n        Judge L. Scott Coogler conducted the Swann and Wilson trials and sentenced Swann on\nMarch 30, 2007, the Rast defendants on March 29, 2007, and the Dougherty defendants on\nMarch 28, 2007. Different judges sentenced McNair and PUGH.\n\n                                            152\n\f(M) (2003).131 That a district court may have used the wrong version of the\n\nguidelines in a co-defendant’s separate sentencing (to the benefit of a defendant)\n\ndoes not make another defendant’s sentence under the correct version unreasonable\n\nin any way. In addition, the Dougherty defendants’ profits were much lower than\n\nthe Pugh and Rast defendants, who also gave bribes to Swann. Also, Swann\n\nignores the fact that the district court granted a downward variance to 102 months\n\nfrom his advisory guidelines range of 151-188 months. Swann has shown no\n\nreversible error in his 102-month sentence based on disparity with his co-\n\ndefendants.\n\nE.     Swann’s Fine\n\n       The district court ordered that Swann pay a fine of $250,000, based on a fine\n\nguidelines range of $20,000 to approximately $84 million. See U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2.\n\nSwann argues that the district court erred in not considering any of the fine\n\nguidelines factors, including Swann’s ability to pay.\n\n       The sentencing guidelines require courts to “impose a fine in all cases,\n\nexcept where the defendant establishes he is unable to pay and is not likely to\n\nbecome able to pay any fine.” U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a). The defendant has the burden\n\n\n       131\n          With a 16-level increase, Swann’s total offense level would be 28, which, with a\ncriminal history category of I, would yield an advisory guidelines range of 78 to 97 months\nunder the 2000 guidelines. For Dougherty, the PSI used the 2000 edition, and, apparently, there\nwas no objection by the government.\n\n                                              153\n\fof proving inability to pay a fine. United States v. McGuinness, 451 F.3d 1302,\n\n1307 (11th Cir. 2006).132\n\n       After determining a fine is appropriate, the district court shall consider these\n\nfactors in fixing the amount of the fine:\n\n       (1) the need for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness of the\n       offense (including the harm or loss to the victim and the gain to the\n       defendant), to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment\n       and to afford adequate deterrence;\n       (2) any evidence presented as to the defendant’s ability to pay the fine\n       (including the ability to pay over a period of time) in light of his earning\n       capacity and financial resources;\n       (3) the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents\n       relative to alternative punishments;\n       (4) any restitution or reparation that the defendant has made or is\n       obligated to make;\n       (5) any collateral consequences of conviction, including civil obligations\n       arising from the defendant’s conduct;\n       (6) whether the defendant previously has been fined for a similar\n       offense;\n       (7) the expected costs to the government of any term of probation, or\n       term of imprisonment and term of supervised release imposed; and\n       (8) any other pertinent equitable considerations.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(d).\n\n       “While some circuits require that the district court make specific findings,\n\nwe have adopted the less rigid approach, and do not require the sentencing court to\n\nmake specific findings of fact with respect to the Sentencing Guideline factors as\n\n\n\n       132\n         This Court reviews a district court’s decision that a defendant can pay a fine for clear\nerror.

Khawaja, 118 F.3d 1454, 1459 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\nWe have applied this rule to uphold a fine where the district court did not make\n\nexplicit findings of fact as to the defendant’s ability to pay. United States v. Long,\n\n122 F.3d 1360, 1367 (11th Cir. 1997). However, “[i]f the record does not reflect\n\nthe district court’s reasoned basis for imposing a fine, we must remand the case so\n\nthat the necessary factual findings can be made.” United States v. Gonzalez, 541\n\nF.3d 1250, 1256 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Swann claims the PSI said Swann could pay a fine within the guidelines\n\nrange or make a lump-sum restitution but not both. That is not correct. We quoted\n\nthe PSI earlier as it (1) says that Swann could pay a fine or make a lump-sum\n\npayment toward restitution shortly after sentencing with liquid assets, and then (2)\n\n\n\n                                           155\n\fstates it does not determine Swann’s future ability to pay a fine or further\n\nrestitution on an installment basis.\n\n       Furthermore, the district court adopted the factual findings in the PSI, which\n\nincluded numerous findings relevant to Swann’s current income and future earning\n\ncapacity. The PSI set forth Swann’s net worth, educational background, work\n\nhistory, and monthly income of $6,729, yielding $80,748 annually. Swann holds\n\ntwo bachelors degrees, one in civil engineering and one in textile management, and\n\na masters degree in sanitary engineering. Swann has retired from Jefferson County\n\nbut submitted no evidence to show he had tried and failed to gain employment.\n\nSwann already has an annual retirement income of $80,748 even without social\n\nsecurity or future wages from working.133\n\n       Although Swann makes two mortgage payments on the two Winwood Drive\n\nresidences and pays over $658 in monthly home utility, lawn, pest control, and\n\nmaintenance expenses, the homes are in his wife’s name and she lives there too.\n\nThe record shows Swann can pay at least some fine. The record also shows\n\nSwann’s counsel argued for a reduced fine and the district court considered the\n\npertinent factors. As the district court reviewed the PSI before imposing the fine\n\nand heard argument of counsel about the fine, “we infer without hesitation that the\n\n\n       133\n        The PSI, dated February 5, 2007, did not show Swann drawing any social security. In\n2010, Swann is now 64.\n\n                                            156\n\fdistrict court considered the pertinent factors prior to imposing the fine.” Khawaja,\n\n118 F.3d at 1459.\n\n      Although Swann has shown no clear error in the district court’s imposition\n\nof some fine, the record is not sufficient to permit us to say there is no error in the\n\namount of the fine. As to the $250,000 amount, the district court remarked: “I\n\ndon’t know whether that’s collectable or not. I don’t think it is . . . .” We cannot\n\nglean from the record the basis for this statement or how the court determined that\n\nthe fine should be $250,000 as opposed to $150,000 or $750,000, especially given\n\nthe fine guidelines range goes up to $84 million. Thus, we vacate and remand as to\n\nthe amount of the fine. See Khawaja, 118 F.3d at 1459-60 (requiring remand\n\nwhere record does not reflect court’s reasoned basis for amount of $175,000 fine).\n\n                            XIV. PUGH’S SENTENCE\n\n      PUGH was sentenced to 60 months’ probation on four bribery conspiracy\n\ncounts (Counts 1 involving McNair, 51 involving Swann, 75 involving Wilson,\n\nand 78 involving Barber), nine substantive bribery counts (Counts 15, 61-63, 71,\n\n83-86), and eleven counts of honest services mail fraud (Counts 90-100). The\n\ndistrict court ordered PUGH to pay a $19.4 million fine, a special assessment of\n\n$9,600, and $239,652 in restitution to the Jefferson County Commission. On\n\nappeal, PUGH challenges only the fine.\n\n\n\n                                           157\n\fA.     Presentence Report\n\n       The PSI stated that PUGH performed nearly $200 million worth of\n\nconstruction work for sewer projects for Jefferson County between 1997 and 2003\n\nand that a majority of this work was for JCESD-related projects. The PSI listed\n\nbribes given by PUGH to McNair, Swann, Chandler, Barber, and Wilson, totaling\n\n$395,514.134 The PSI stated that PUGH had this net income: $19.09 million in\n\n2001, $15.32 million in 2002, $9.10 million in 2003, $2.94 million in 2004, and\n\n$3.67 million in 2005. PUGH’s federal tax returns reported net income of $17.89\n\nmillion in 2001, $14.95 million in 2002, $8.10 million in 2003, $3 million in 2004,\n\nand $3.97 million in 2005.\n\n       According to the PSI, PUGH received more than $109 million in JCESD\n\ncontracts related to the bribery conspiracy from August 1999 to June 2003. This\n\n$109 million reflected only PUGH’s portion of its joint venture work for Jefferson\n\nCounty. The PSI determined that from 1999 to 2002 PUGH earned an average\n\n\n\n       134\n          This $395,514 in restitution consists of PUGH’s payments of:\n       (1) $192,000 to McNair ($175,000 for construction, remodeling, and cash for his studio\nand $17,200 installation of hand railings for his studio);\n       (2) $149,102 to Swann ($140,680 for Guthrie Landscaping, $7,422 for installation of\nwaterfall and pond, and $1,000 in gift certificates to Alabama Book Smith);\n       (3) $610 to Chandler for condominium rental at Pelican Beach Condominiums;\n       (4) $49,102 to Barber ($47,927 for McCalla, Alabama land, $148 for casino trip to\nVicksburg, Mississippi, $546 resort trip to Biloxi, Mississippi, and $481 trip to Gulf Shores,\nAlabama); and\n       (5) $4,500 to Wilson (UAB scholarship).\n\n                                              158\n\fprofit of 43.61% and that PUGH’s profit from County contracts was $47.92\n\nmillion.135\n\n       The PSI: (1) assigned PUGH a base offense level of 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(a) (2003); (2) added 2 levels because the offense involved more than one\n\nbribe, pursuant to § 2C1.1(b)(1); and (3) added 22 levels because the net profit to\n\nPUGH was between $20 million and $50 million, pursuant to §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A)\n\nand 2B1.1(b)(1)(L),136 yielding a total offense level of 34.137 Under the § 8C2.4(d)\n\ntable, this total offense level of 34 required a base fine amount of $28.5 million.\n\n       However, the PSI determined PUGH’s pecuniary gain under § 8C2.4(a)(2)\n\nwas its $47.92 million profit from the County contracts. Under § 8C2.4(a), the\n\nbase fine amount became $47.92 million, because PUGH’s $47.92 million\n\npecuniary gain was greater than the $28.5 million amount from the § 8C2.4(d) fine\n\ntable and greater than the pecuniary loss of $319,425 suffered by the victim\n\n\n\n       135\n          PUGH later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time PUGH’s PSI was prepared,\nthe bankruptcy case was pending. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court confirmed PUGH’s\nproposed plan of liquidation. See In re Roland Pugh Constr., Inc., No. Bk-06-71769-CMS-11,\n2007 WL 509225 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. Feb. 12, 2007). The bankruptcy court ordered PUGH to\nestablish a trust account in the amount of $19,409,600, which would be used to pay the federal\ncriminal fine assessed in the present case. In re Roland Pugh Constr., Inc., No. Bk-06-71769-\nCMS-11 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. Apr. 21, 2008).\n       136\n           The PSI listed the table section as “§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(M)” but applied the enhancement\nlisted in § 2B1.1(b)(1)(L) of that table, which provides a 22-level enhancement for amounts\nbetween $20 million and $50 million.\n       137\n             The PSI for PUGH used the November 1, 2003 edition of the Sentencing Manual.\n\n                                               159\n\fCounty.\n\n      The PSI determined PUGH’s culpability score was 7 under § 8C2.5, because\n\n(1) PUGH had 50 or more employees and (2) individuals with substantial authority\n\n(Board Chairman Roland Pugh, CEO Grady Pugh, and President Yessick)\n\nparticipated in the offenses. This culpability score of 7 resulted in a minimum fine\n\nmultiplier of 1.4 and a maximum multiplier of 2.8, under § 8C2.6. Based on these\n\nmultipliers and the base fine of approximately $47.92 million, the PSI calculated\n\nthe guidelines fine range to be $67,089,446.48 to $134,178,892.96.\n\n      The statutory maximum fine was $95,842,066, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3571(b), (d) (i.e., double the pecuniary gain of $47.92 million). Thus, the PSI\n\nconcluded PUGH’s advisory guidelines fine range was $67,089,446 to\n\n$95,842,066.\n\n      The PSI stated PUGH appeared unable to pay a fine within that $67 million\n\nto $95 million guidelines range and recommended the district court reduce the fine\n\nif it determined PUGH was unable to pay the minimum fine amount. The PSI\n\nnoted that, under § 8C3.4, the guidelines fine could be offset by 67.75%, because\n\n(1) PUGH was a closely held organization, (2) three of PUGH’s owners (Roland\n\nPugh, Yessick, and Grady Pugh) whose total interests amounted to 67.75% had\n\nalready been fined for the same offense conduct, and (3) one owner (Andy Pugh)\n\n\n\n                                         160\n\fhad a 32.25% interest and was not convicted in the bribery scheme.\n\n       PUGH objected to the PSI’s calculation of profits or pecuniary gain. PUGH\n\nargued there was no evidence that PUGH obtained any contracts, or the $47.92\n\nmillion in profits, because of its bribes. PUGH contended its base offense level\n\nshould be based on the $129,138.81 amount of bribes PUGH paid, which would\n\nresult in a total offense level of 22 and a base fine of $1.2 million.138\n\nB.     Supplemental Briefing Before Sentencing\n\n       The district court ordered briefs addressing the fine amount. PUGH’s brief\n\nreiterated its challenge to the PSI’s calculations, arguing there was no evidence the\n\nCounty suffered any pecuniary loss from the bribery scheme.\n\n       The government recalculated PUGH’s pecuniary gain based on a job-by-job\n\nanalysis of PUGH’s contracts with the County. The government submitted a list of\n\nbribery and post-bribery jobs, which showed the revenue earned, gross profit, gross\n\nprofit percentage, and “improper gain” for each job. The government calculated an\n\naverage unit price for items used by PUGH in eight of its projects over a 20-month\n\nperiod from 2001 to 2002 and then compared those prices for this time period to\n\nthe average unit price PUGH charged the County for these items during the bribery\n\n\n\n       138\n         PUGH’s total did not use certain amounts that were included in the PSI, such as (1)\n$60,696 that PUGH claimed Swann repaid to PUGH, (2) $37,000 worth of unperformed work on\nSwann’s home that PUGH paid Guthrie for, and (3) $167,679 in items PUGH gave to McNair.\n\n                                            161\n\fperiod of 1997 to 2001. The government determined PUGH’s improper gain was\n\n$24.667 million, while PUGH made about $20 million in “normal profit.” Based\n\non the improper gain of $24.667 million and applicable multipliers, the\n\ngovernment concluded PUGH’s guidelines fine range was $34.533 million to\n\n$69.067 million.139\n\n       PUGH’s reply brief then challenged the government’s recalculation for\n\nfailing to account for a price increase that occurred in 2003 and for using\n\nartificially low post-bribery prices in 2001 and 2002. PUGH claims this skewed\n\nthe government’s analysis of PUGH’s profits to reflect greater profits during the\n\nbribery period. PUGH also claimed that, to prove PUGH profited from the bribery\n\nscheme, the government had to show that PUGH’s bribes caused the PRC to limit\n\nthe number of cured-in-place contracts.\n\nC.     Sentencing Hearing\n\n       The district court conducted a lengthy sentencing hearing, including two\n\ndays of evidence and a partial day of argument on evidence assessment and factual\n\n\n       139\n           When comparing the unit prices of bribery-period and post-bribery jobs, the\ngovernment’s analysis used only PUGH’s sewer rehab jobs — and not other jobs such as\nwastewater treatments, trunk sewer jobs, and annual contracts — so that the analysis would\nreflect an “apples-to-apples” comparison. FBI Agent Tom Mayhall stated PUGH earned about\n$55 million from other work from the County, which was not included in the improper gain\ncalculation.\n        Although the government points out PUGH continued to make some bribes in 2001 and\nwell into 2002, the majority of PUGH’s bribes were given prior to December 31, 2000, and the\ngovernment thus compared the profit before the end of 2000 with that in 2001-02.\n\n                                             162\n\fdeterminations. The government presented evidence as to the bribes PUGH paid\n\nand the revenue and profits PUGH earned from its County contracts during the\n\nbribery scheme. For example, FBI Agent Tom Mayhall calculated PUGH’s\n\nimproper gains by comparing (1) the average unit price of items on invoices for\n\nsewer rehab jobs PUGH submitted to the County during the bribery scheme\n\nthrough the end of 2000 with (2) the average unit price of items on eight sewer\n\nrehab jobs PUGH performed in 2001 and 2002. Based on this comparison, Agent\n\nMayhall concluded PUGH’s improper gain was approximately $24.667 million.140\n\nAgent Mayhall testified about PUGH’s bribes to County employees and the\n\nbenefits PUGH received from its County contracts and as a result of the PRC’s\n\ndecisions. PUGH maintained that the increase in profits was not substantial and\n\nwas based on areas of PUGH’s business other than its work for the County.\n\n       The district court rejected the government’s pricing analysis, finding that the\n\nevidence failed to show the line items in PUGH’s contracts were affected by the\n\nbribes PUGH paid. The court found PUGH paid bribes to County employees\n\nbecause PUGH was “afraid of what might happen if [it] did not do so” and that\n\n\n       140\n           Agent Mayhall testified PUGH made about $44.536 million total gross profit on about\n$109 million in revenue on JCESD rehab jobs during the bribery period. Mayhall testified that\nof this $44.536 million total gross profit, about $19.869 million was a result of PUGH’s normal\nprofit margin, and the remaining $24.667 million was therefore improper gain. Mayhall added\nthat PUGH had about $22 million in cash on hand, which earned about $77,000 per month in\ninterest, and bankruptcy creditors claimed less than $200,000 of that cash.\n\n                                              163\n\f“what might have happened is that [PUGH] might have lost all its contracts, those\n\ncurrent and future, with the County and the profits associated with those\n\ncontracts.”141 The court further found, for example, “that the Swann bribes . . .\n\nwere designed to ensure that [PUGH] stayed in good favor with Mr. Swann so that\n\n[PUGH] would have and continue to have the opportunity to receive contracts and\n\nbe paid on contracts from Jefferson County.” The court later stated “there [was] an\n\nexpectation that if you do business with the County, you’re expected to do this.\n\nAnd I think that the reason [PUGH] did it was because others were doing it and it\n\nwanted to protect the contracts it had.”\n\n      The court also found that, beginning in August 1999, PUGH started making\n\nbribes “in order to maintain its standing in the revenues and profits realized in the\n\ncontracts awarded by Jefferson County; and, indeed, they became extremely high\n\nprofits during that bribe period.”\n\n      The district court found that PUGH made its first bribe in August 1999 and\n\nits final bribe in September 2002. The court found that (1) from September 1,\n\n1999 to December 31, 2002, PUGH benefitted from the bribes, (2) during this\n\n1999-2002 period PUGH generated from its County contracts a total profit of\n\n\n\n\n      141\n            Judge David R. Proctor conducted the Barber trial and sentenced the Pugh defendants.\n\n                                                164\n\f$43,985,869,142 and (3) given PUGH’s $107,887,832 in revenues, this $43,985,869\n\nprofit was a 40.77% profit margin during that period. Using that profit to calculate\n\nthe base fine amount, the district court determined the guidelines fine range was\n\n$61,580,216 to $87,971,738. See U.S.S.G. §§ 8C2.5, 8C2.7. After considering\n\nPUGH’s ability to pay, the district court reduced the fine to $21 million. The\n\ndistrict court then gave a $1.6 million offset for fines paid by individuals who\n\nowned at least 5% of PUGH, which resulted in a final fine of $19.4 million.\n\nD.     Challenges to $19.4 Million Fine\n\n       On appeal, PUGH primarily raises objections to the manner in which the\n\ndistrict court arrived at the $19.4 million fine, but none of them has merit. The PSI\n\ncontained extensive financial information about PUGH’s revenue and profits. The\n\ndistrict court’s fact-findings are supported by the record and undisputed facts in the\n\nPSI, and PUGH has shown no clear error in any of them. PUGH also has shown\n\nno legal error in any of the district court’s calculations regarding the advisory\n\nguidelines fine range or in any other matters under the sentencing guidelines.\n\n       PUGH’s brief as to the fine mainly resorts to claiming PUGH did not have\n\n       142\n          The court found, “[t]he September 1, ‘99 date signifies the first contract awarded to\nPugh by the County after the August 1999 concrete work was done for McNair.” The court\nstated: “I have not attributed any profits made by Pugh in 2003, although the government may\nwell have a good argument that profits in 2003 and revenues in 2003 continued to be effected\n[sic] because of the bribes paid in ‘99, 2000, 2001 and 2002.” The court added: “Likewise, I\nhave not attributed any pre-September 1999 gain to Pugh Construction based upon the bribe\nscheme that was in place and paid by other contractors.”\n\n                                               165\n\fadequate notice of certain arguments or adequate opportunity to respond. The\n\nrecord refutes those claims too. The parties submitted numerous sentencing briefs\n\nand offered a substantial amount of evidence as to PUGH’s revenue and profits.\n\nPUGH claims it did not know the district court would consider that the bribes were\n\npaid out of fear of losing contracts or future payments thereon. However, PUGH’s\n\ncounsel, in arguing that the bribes were unrelated to the PRC, relied on the fact that\n\nthe contractors feared what would happen if they did not pay bribes:\n\n      [L]et me explain to [the court] why I think the contractors make such\n      payments to public officials.\n      ....\n      [T]he best testimony that I heard about that was from Mr. William\n      Dawson. Mr. Dawson was an engineer, independent, who was doing\n      work for Jefferson County. . . . Mr. McNair invited him to come by the\n      studio. And when he got there, Mr. McNair said, Mr. Dawson I’ve never\n      asked you for anything before, but what I would like is for you to buy\n      me an audio-visual equipment, some sort of a projector or something of\n      that nature, and he had a book. And he said this is the model and this is\n      what I would like to have. Well, Mr. Dawson didn’t want to do that.\n      And he went home and he thought about it and finally he did it. And he\n      did it because he was afraid of what Chris McNair would do to him if he\n      didn’t.\n\n      So when these people come and put the touch on a contractor or\n      someone, I think it’s the fear of the unknown.\n\nIn closing arguments, PUGH’s trial counsel maintained that any benefits PUGH\n\nprovided to the County employees were given purely out of friendship. PUGH\n\ncannot now claim it had an inadequate opportunity to explain its motivation in\n\n\n\n                                          166\n\fpaying bribes or to prepare for the ultimate approach the district court took in\n\ndeciding on the amount of the fine. If anything, counsel’s argument succeeded in\n\nreducing the amount of the fine imposed to well below the advisory guidelines\n\nrange of $61,580,216 to $87,971,738. PUGH has shown no reversible error in any\n\nprocedural aspects of the sentencing proceedings before the district court in\n\nPUGH’s case.\n\n                                  XV. CONCLUSION\n\n        We affirm all of the defendant-appellants’ convictions except PUGH’s\n\nconviction on Count 75, which we reverse. We affirm McNair’s sentence. We\n\naffirm Swann’s sentence except as to the amount of the fine. While there was no\n\nlegal error in the imposition of some fine for Swann, we vacate and remand as to\n\nthe amount of the fine. As to PUGH’s sentence, we (1) affirm the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact as supported by the record; and (2) conclude there was no error in\n\nthe district court’s calculations under the sentencing guidelines; but (3) in light of\n\nthe reversal of its Count 75 conviction, we vacate PUGH’s sentence and remand\n\nfor resentencing without Count 75.143\n\n       AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED AND\n\n\n       143\n         PUGH was convicted and sentenced on 24 counts of conviction, and the reversal on\nCount 75 does not appear to impact its overall sentence. However, in an abundance of caution,\nwe vacate PUGH’s sentence and remand for resentencing by the district court because, at a\nminimum, Count 75 must be removed.\n\n                                              167\n\fREMANDED IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n                    168\n\f",

A 127-count Second Superseding\n\nIndictment (the “Indictment”) charged sixteen defendants (eleven individuals and\n\nfive corporate firms) with conspiracy to commit bribery, substantive offenses of\n\nbribery, honest services mail fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice. Nine\n\ndefendants appeal their convictions here. Three of those nine defendants appeal\n\ntheir sentences.\n\n      Specifically, the nine defendant-appellants are: two former County officials,\n\nthree corporate contractors, and four individuals who owned these respective\n\ncontractors. The two defendant County officials were in charge of the sewer\n\nprogram and received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes from the\n\ndefendant contractors. In many cases, the contractors disguised these payments by\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\faltering invoices or hiding costs within their accounting systems. In turn, the\n\ndefendant contractors obtained hundreds of millions of dollars worth of payments\n\non construction and engineering contracts with the County. The County officials\n\napproved the contractors’ pay requests, change orders, time extensions, and/or\n\nrequests for field directives, all of which financially benefitted the defendant\n\ncontractors.\n\n       After review and oral argument, we conclude the evidence at the trials\n\noverwhelmingly established the defendant-appellants’ guilt, and they have shown\n\nno reversible error in the district courts’ rulings, pre-trial or in the trials, in the\n\ncases consolidated on appeal. Thus, we affirm all of the defendant-appellants’\n\nconvictions except Roland Pugh Construction, Inc.’s conviction on Count 75,\n\nwhich is barred by the statute of limitations. We also affirm Jewell C. “Chris”\n\nMcNair’s sentence in full. We affirm Jack W. Swann’s sentence in part but\n\nremand for further proceedings as to the amount of the fine. As to the sentence of\n\nRoland Pugh Construction, Inc., we (1) affirm the district court’s findings of fact\n\nas supported by the record; and (2) conclude there was no error in the district\n\ncourt’s calculations under the sentencing guidelines; but (3) in light of the reversal\n\nof its Count 75 conviction, we vacate its sentence and remand for resentencing\n\nwithout Count 75.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Jefferson County Officials\n\n       The defendant County officials implicated in the bribery scandal are:\n\n       Defendant McNair: Jewell C. “Chris” McNair (“McNair”) was a Jefferson\n\nCounty Commissioner. McNair was responsible for overseeing the operation of\n\nthe Jefferson County Environmental Services Division (“JCESD”), which included\n\nthe sewer system.1\n\n       Defendant Swann: Jack W. Swann (“Swann”) was the Director of the\n\nJCESD.\n\n       Defendant Wilson: Ronald K. Wilson (“Wilson”) was Chief Civil Engineer\n\nfor the JCESD and served on the Product Review Committee (“PRC”).2 After\n\nleaving the JCESD in 1999, Wilson formed his own firm, Civil Engineering\n\nDesign Services, Inc. (“CEDS”).\n\n\n       1\n          The repair and rehabilitation project, which is the subject of this appeal, was required\nunder the terms of a consent decree between Jefferson County and the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency. The consent decree was entered into as a settlement of claims brought by the\nU.S. Justice Department in 1994 against Jefferson County for violations of the Clean Water Act,\nand it required Jefferson County to repair and upgrade dilapidated sewer lines and wastewater\ntreatment plants that were overflowing and leaking sewage into local watersheds. The JCESD\ninitially estimated the work would cost County ratepayers $1.2 to 1.5 billion over the next\ndecade. The actual costs were closer to $3 billion.\n       2\n         The PRC was a technical committee that reviewed materials, specified the products that\ncould be used on the sewer project, and qualified contractors for certain kinds of work on the\nproject. During the relevant time period, the PRC had between 10 and 11 members. Among\nthem were defendants Wilson and Barber, and co-conspirators Harry Chandler, Donald Ellis, and\nLarry Creel.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Defendant Barber: Clarence R. Barber (“Barber”) was Chief Construction\n\nMaintenance Supervisor for the JCESD and served on the PRC.\n\nB.     Contractors\n\n       These defendant corporate firms and individuals had either construction or\n\nengineering contracts with the JCESD and were implicated in the bribery scandal.\n\n       Pugh defendants: Roland Pugh Construction, Inc. (“PUGH”); Grady Roland\n\nPugh, Sr. (“Roland Pugh”), founder, board chairman, and 70% owner of PUGH;\n\nand Joseph E. “Eddie” Yessick (“Yessick”), President and 10% owner of PUGH.\n\nPUGH had $178 million in sewer construction contracts with Jefferson County\n\nbetween August 1999 and January 2002. PUGH was a “dig-and-replace”\n\ncontractor.3\n\n       Rast defendants: Rast Construction, Inc. (“RAST”); Bobby J. Rast (“Bobby\n\nRast”), President and co-owner of RAST; and his brother Daniel B. Rast (“Danny\n\nRast”), Vice President and co-owner of RAST. RAST had about $100 million in\n\nsewer construction contracts with Jefferson County during the same period. RAST\n\nwas another “dig-and-replace” contractor.\n\n       3\n        A “dig-and-replace” contractor traditionally digs up broken sewer pipes, replaces them,\nand paves over the repair. Some dig-and-replace contractors have the capacity to perform\n“cured-in-place” work. The “cured-in-place” process involves the relining of cracked pipes with\na cement product that cures inside the pipes and seals the cracks from within. None of the\ndefendants here performed cured-in-place work. However, PUGH and Defendant Rast\nConstruction, Inc. entered into joint ventures with contractors who could perform cured-in-place\nwork, as discussed later.\n\n                                               5\n\f      Dougherty defendants: F. W. Dougherty Engineering & Associates, Inc.\n\n(“FWDE”) and Floyd W. “Pat” Dougherty (“Dougherty”), President and owner.\n\nFWDE received $11.4 million in no-bid engineering contracts with Jefferson\n\nCounty during the same period.\n\n      USI defendants: US Infrastructure, Inc. (“USI”); Sohan Singh (“Singh”),\n\nPresident of USI; and Edward Key (“Key”), Vice President of USI. USI received\n\nabout $50 million in engineering contracts with Jefferson County between 1999\n\nand 2003.\n\nC.    Co-conspirators\n\n      Five other individual co-conspirators pled guilty and testified for the\n\ngovernment in one or more of the five trials:\n\n      Grady Pugh: Grady Roland Pugh, Jr. (“Grady Pugh”) was CEO and 10%\n\nowner of PUGH. He is the defendant Roland Pugh’s son.\n\n      Chandler: Harry T. Chandler (“Chandler”) was Assistant Director of the\n\nJCESD and served on the PRC.\n\n      Ellis: Donald R. Ellis (“Ellis”) was an engineer for the JCESD and Chairman\n\nof the PRC.\n\n      Creel: Larry P. Creel (“Creel”) was a Maintenance Supervisor for the\n\nJCESD and served on the PRC.\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f       Dawson: William H. Dawson (“Dawson”) was the owner of Dawson\n\nEngineering, Inc. (“Dawson Engineering”), which received at least $20 million\n\nworth of no-bid engineering contracts from Jefferson County.\n\n       While the Indictment alleges certain conduct by these five individuals as co-\n\nconspirators, they are not named defendants in the Indictment at issue in this\n\nappeal.\n\nD.     The Indictment\n\n       The Indictment contained 127 counts.4 Six of the counts charged a bribery\n\nconspiracy. Specifically, Counts 1 (against McNair and the Pugh, Rast, and\n\nDougherty defendants), 32 (against McNair and the USI defendants), 50 (against\n\nMcNair and the USI defendants), 51 (against Swann and the Pugh, Rast, and\n\nDougherty defendants, except for Roland Pugh), 75 (against Wilson and PUGH),\n\nand 78 (against Barber and the Pugh defendants) charged conspiracy to commit\n\nbribery under 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 666.\n\n       Counts 2-31, 33-49, 52-74, 76-77, and 79-89 charged one or more\n\ndefendants with substantive bribery offenses (or aiding and abetting bribery) under\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        The original indictment was filed on February 7, 2005, and the Superseding Indictment\nwas filed on July 13, 2005. After the five co-conspirators listed above pled guilty over a period\nof several months, the government submitted the Second Superseding Indictment on August 26,\n2005, dropping the defendants who had pled guilty. The counts referenced in this opinion are as\nnumbered in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n\n                                                7\n\f18 U.S.C. § 666. For the most part, these substantive bribery offenses were the\n\novert acts charged in the conspiracy counts.\n\n       Counts 90-101 charged honest services mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341\n\nand 1346 against defendants Swann, Yessick, and PUGH. Counts 102-121\n\ncharged honest services mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1346 against\n\ndefendants Swann, Wilson, CEDS, FWDE, and Dougherty. Counts 122-124\n\ncharged mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 against the Dougherty defendants.\n\nCounts 125-127 charged obstruction of justice against certain defendants under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1503.\n\n       Some of these counts were dismissed before trial, and other counts were\n\ndismissed prior to jury deliberations. And some defendants, such as Roland Pugh,\n\nwere dismissed from some of the counts that went to the jury. This opinion\n\naddresses only the counts that were actually submitted to the jury.\n\nE.     Five Trials\n\n       The 127-count Indictment was severed into five separate cases for trial:\n\nMcNair (05-061), Swann (05-544), Barber (05-542), Wilson (05-545), and USI\n\n(05-543).5 The McNair trial involved bribes by the Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty\n\n\n       5\n       Grady Pugh, Chandler, Ellis, Dawson, and Creel testified for the government in the\nMcNair trial. Chandler, Ellis, and Wilson testified for the government in the Swann trial. Grady\nPugh, Chandler, and Yessick testified for the government in the Barber trial. Grady Pugh and\nChandler testified for the government in the Wilson trial. Chandler, Ellis, and Dawson testified\n\n                                               8\n\fdefendants primarily to McNair but also to Chandler and Ellis. The USI trial\n\ninvolved bribes to McNair by the USI defendants. The other trials involved bribes\n\nto Swann, Barber, and Wilson, respectively.\n\n       In the USI trial, defendants USI, Key, and Singh were convicted of, among\n\nother things, conspiracy to commit bribery and substantive bribery offenses for\n\nmaking payments to defendant Commissioner McNair and the JCESD’s Chandler\n\nand Ellis. This Court affirmed defendants USI, Key, and Singh’s convictions and\n\nsentences in United States v. US Infrastructure, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78412\"><a href=\"/opinion/78412/united-states-v-us-infrastructure-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2009),\n\ncert. denied, __ S.

McNair’s\n\nappeal in the USI case has been consolidated with the present appeal.\n\nF.     Nine Parties to This Appeal\n\n       This present consolidated appeal involves not only defendant McNair’s\n\nappeal in the USI case but also these defendants’ appeals in the other four trials:\n\n       (1) McNair trial: defendants McNair, PUGH, Roland Pugh, RAST, Bobby\n\n\nfor the government in the USI trial.\n       6\n        McNair’s motion to dismiss sought dismissal of Counts 32 and 50 (both counts of\nconspiracy to commit bribery), arguing under “Wharton’s Rule” that a conspiracy cannot exist as\nan offense separate from the substantive offense of bribery (charged in Counts 33-37).\n\n                                               9\n\fRast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty. Defendant Yessick (President of\n\nPUGH) was convicted at trial and does not appeal.\n\n      (2) Swann trial: defendants Swann, PUGH, RAST, Bobby Rast, FWDE, and\n\nDougherty. Defendant Yessick was convicted at trial and does not appeal.\n\n      (3) Barber trial: defendant PUGH. Defendants Barber and Yessick pled\n\nguilty and do not appeal.\n\n      (4) Wilson trial: defendant PUGH. Defendant Wilson was convicted at trial\n\nand does not appeal.\n\n      Albeit from five separate cases, the defendant-appellants raise many of the\n\nsame issues. We discuss (1) the evidence in the McNair, Swann, Barber, and\n\nWilson trials, and (2) the issues commonly raised by the defendants, followed by\n\n(3) certain issues pertaining to particular defendants.\n\n                        II. THE McNAIR TRIAL (05-061)\n\n      The McNair trial, held from April 6 to 21, 2006, involved over $350,000 in\n\nbribes the Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants paid to Commissioner McNair\n\nand $6,600 in bribes they paid to County employees Chandler and Ellis. The\n\ngovernment called 36 witnesses, including Chandler, Ellis, Dawson, Creel, and\n\nGrady Pugh. The defense called 23 witnesses. No named defendant testified.\n\n      The government’s witnesses described in great detail the bribes to McNair,\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fChandler, and Ellis, and how those three County officials financially helped the\n\nPugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants in their contracts with and payments from\n\nJefferson County. Because the defendant contractors in the McNair trial claimed\n\nthey paid McNair only out of a long-time friendship and lacked corrupt intent, the\n\ndistrict court admitted certain evidence, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b),\n\nabout how these same defendants bribed Swann and other County employees in\n\norder to show the defendants’ corrupt intent and common plan. Thus, our\n\nrecitation of evidence in the McNair trial covers bribes given not only to McNair\n\nbut also to Swann and other County employees.\n\nA.       McNair Helps Contractor-Defendants\n\n         Jefferson County was governed by five elected Commissioners, each of\n\nwhom had a different area of responsibility. Defendant McNair held office as a\n\nCounty Commissioner from 1996 until his retirement in March 2001. McNair was\n\nresponsible for overseeing the JCESD, which included the sewer systems. McNair\n\nhad authority to approve pay requests from the sewer construction contractors, to\n\napprove change orders7 increasing the contract price paid to those contractors, to\n\napprove change orders modifying the contract terms in favor of those contractors,\n\nto approve emergency payments to contractors, to select consulting engineers\n\n\n         7\n             Change orders are contract modifications in the Jefferson County Commission’s Agenda\nitems.\n\n                                                  11\n\fthrough a no-bid process, and to approve the engineers’ contracts and payments.\n\nAlthough final approval required the vote of the entire Commission, there was no\n\nevidence that the Commission questioned or disapproved of any pay request or\n\nchange order approved by McNair or any selection or award of a contract\n\nrecommended by McNair. McNair’s nickname among the contractors was “Big\n\nMan.”\n\n        McNair approved payments (in the hundreds of millions of dollars) to the\n\nPugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants (the “contractor-defendants”), approved\n\nchange orders (in the millions of dollars) benefitting PUGH and RAST, and\n\napproved no-bid engineering contracts (in the millions of dollars) to FWDE, all\n\nwhile these defendants were paying for materials and labor to expand and renovate\n\nMcNair’s photography studio. Each item requiring Commission approval, such as\n\ncontract awards or modifications, needed McNair to approve it first and then to put\n\nit on the Commission’s agenda for further approval.8 The sewer construction\n\ncontracts were awarded through a sealed bid process and would go to the lowest\n\n\n        8\n        For example, the December 1999 Commission Agenda shows a modification adding\n$1,081,621 (about 28% of the contract value) to a PUGH contract, and a $112,600 contract\naward to FWDE. The January 2000 Agenda indicates a modification adding $489,133 to a\nPUGH contract. The February 2000 Agendas indicate a modification adding $400,724 to a\nRAST contract, a $721,132 contract award to FWDE, and a modification adding $1,377,267 to a\nPUGH contract. The March 2000 Agenda indicates a $5,289,002 contract award to PUGH. The\nApril 2000 Agenda indicates contract awards of $994,640 and $348,103 to FWDE, a\nmodification adding $439,722 to a RAST contract, and a modification adding $850,264 to a\nPUGH contract.\n\n                                            12\n\fbidder. But the prospective contractors had to satisfy technical standards set by the\n\nPRC before they would be eligible to bid.\n\n       Once a new contract was awarded and in place, Chandler and other\n\nsupervisors, such as Ellis, could approve changed or additional work as “field\n\ndirectives.” If a requested change exceeded the original contract amount, Chandler\n\nand Ellis could recommend “change orders” (requests for additional funds), which\n\nMcNair would then approve and place on the Commission’s agenda, without\n\nfurther competitive bidding. The JCESD also could award “emergency” work to\n\nconstruction contractors without competitive bidding. For emergency jobs, Barber\n\ntypically selected the contractor, negotiated the price, and then sent the pay\n\nrequests to McNair, Swann, and Chandler for approval. Together, McNair, Swann,\n\nand Chandler approved a variety of contracts for the sewer project.9\n\n       The construction contractors’ work was supervised by independent\n\nconsulting engineers, whose jobs were to make sure the contractors performed\n\naccording to specifications and to sign off on payments and requests for change\n\norders. This supervision was provided by engineering firms such as FWDE, USI,\n\n\n       9\n        For example, Chandler, Swann, and McNair approved a $1,168,788.02 payment to\nPUGH for work done in January 2001. Chandler, Swann, and McNair approved a $2,652,820\npayment to PUGH for work done in June 2000. Chandler, Swann, and McNair approved a\n$1,000,000 payment to RAST in October 2000. Swann and McNair approved — in one day on\nan emergency basis without Chandler’s or the County engineer’s usual approval — a $1,152,888\npayment to RAST for work done in October 2000.\n\n                                             13\n\fand Dawson Engineering. The engineering consultant contracts were awarded\n\nwithout bidding. Swann and Chandler selected engineering firms, negotiated their\n\ncontracts, and recommended them to McNair for final approval.\n\n      The County’s PRC initially decided to qualify only three contractors to do\n\n“cured-in-place” work: W.L. Hailey (“Hailey”), Insituform, and Reynolds.\n\nBecause the traditional “dig-and-replace” work was grouped with “cured-in-place”\n\nwork for all the major construction contracts, this PRC decision effectively limited\n\nthe “big jobs” to only three bidders: a RAST-Hailey joint venture, a\n\nPUGH-Insituform joint venture, and Reynolds, which did its own dig-and-replace\n\nwork. In late 1999, the PRC changed the criteria, making it more difficult for other\n\ncontractors to pre-qualify for “cured-in-place” work, and potentially delaying by\n\ntwo years the qualification of otherwise qualified contractors.10\n\n      Contractor PUGH’s CEO Grady Pugh admitted to receiving a “general\n\nbenefit” from giving McNair “envelopes of cash,” in that “Jefferson County treated\n\nus real well. We had an opportunity to do a tremendous amount of work there.\n\nThe work that we did there generated huge profits . . . [I]t took our company\n\n[PUGH] from a normal struggling contracting company in [the] mid to late ‘90s, to\n\na thriving, wealthy, strong construction company.”\n\n\n\n      10\n           The PRC and its requirements are discussed more later in the Wilson trial section.\n\n                                                 14\n\f        During the relevant period, PUGH dedicated about 70% of its work to the\n\nJefferson County sewer rehabilitation and received tens of millions of dollars in\n\nrevenue from that sewer work. In 1996 and 1997, at the sewer rehabilitation’s\n\noutset, PUGH made gross profits of 10%, and as the project continued and\n\npayments were made to JCESD officials, the company’s sewer rehabilitation\n\nprofits increased to 50% in 1999, 40% in 2000, and 45% in 2001, making PUGH\n\ntens of millions of dollars each of these years.\n\n        RAST also received tens of millions of dollars in revenue per year from its\n\nJefferson County sewer work. And the engineering firms, including FWDE,\n\nreceived revenue in millions of dollars per year from their work on the sewer\n\nrehabilitation. McNair made the decision every time FWDE or Dawson\n\nEngineering was selected as the outside consulting engineer and awarded a\n\nprofessional service contract. After electrical contractor Gus Henson did some\n\nwork for McNair without charge, McNair had Swann arrange a County contract for\n\nhim, even though the County did not normally hire electrical engineers for sewer\n\nwork.\n\n        In total, from August 1999 to January 2002, Jefferson County paid $178\n\nmillion to PUGH, $100 million to RAST, $11.4 million to FWDE, and $8 million\n\nto Dawson Engineering.\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fB.     Bribes of McNair\n\n       McNair owned a small photography business called McNair Frame & Photo\n\nArt, Inc. (“McNair’s studio”). Between 1999 and early 2002, McNair started a\n\nmajor expansion and renovation of the studio, which would more than double its\n\nsize. McNair’s expansion included adding extras to the studio, such as an\n\napartment for his daughter, a second-story deck, external stairs, a “guard shack,”\n\nand a security gate.\n\n       All contractor-defendants in this case generously contributed to the\n\nrenovation and expansion of McNair’s studio. In 1999, FWDE’s President\n\nDougherty sent Bill Bailey, an FWDE employee initially hired as an inspector for\n\nCounty jobs, to work as the construction superintendent for the studio’s\n\nrenovation. FWDE paid Bailey for the approximately 18 months he spent working\n\nat McNair’s studio. During that time, FWDE paid Bailey $74,240. Although some\n\nof his time was charged to “administration,” FWDE President Dougherty charged\n\nsome of Bailey’s studio time to a JCESD sewer project. McNair was not charged\n\nfor Bailey’s work. As superintendent, FWDE’s Bailey oversaw construction at\n\nMcNair’s studio by numerous other contractors, including PUGH and RAST.11\n\n\n       11\n         As 404(b) evidence, the government showed that in addition to paying $74,240 to\nBailey, FWDE paid the salaries of its employees, Wayne Hendon and John Stanger, while they\nacted as construction superintendents overseeing renovation of JCESD Director Swann’s home.\nFWDE paid Hendon $94,090 and Stanger $28,839 for that work.\n\n                                             16\n\f      RAST excavated for the expansion’s footings for McNair’s studio. In July\n\n1999, PUGH ordered concrete and for four weeks had a four-man crew pour\n\nconcrete walls and do other work on the studio, paying the crew $11,709. PUGH’s\n\ncrew supervisor talked to McNair while the concrete work was in progress, but\n\nMcNair did not question why he was there or where he was from, nor did McNair\n\noffer to pay for this work.\n\n      In late 1999, FWDE’s Bailey asked Barry Mosley of Mosley Construction to\n\ndo wood framing and other finish work at McNair’s studio. McNair initially paid\n\nMosley, first with a check and then with cash, but eventually McNair stopped\n\npaying. Bobby Rast then told Bailey that “McNair was running out of funds” and\n\nthat RAST would begin paying Mosley directly. From July 2000 to December\n\n2000, RAST wrote 20 checks totaling $52,990 to Mosley as his work at the studio\n\nprogressed, and, at Bobby Rast’s direction, coded these payments as expenses on a\n\nJCESD sewer project. Either Bailey or someone from RAST’s office, such as\n\nDanny Rast, brought Mosley the checks.\n\n      In January 2002, RAST gave Mosley two more checks totaling $7,200 for\n\nwork he and his crew did on the studio’s “guard shack,” a two-story, 12 x 12\n\nbuilding designed by defendant Dougherty, and built, in part, by defendants RAST\n\nand FWDE. Bobby Rast caused these payments to be coded as expenses on the\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f“Upper Valley Rehab” or Kilsby contract, a JCESD sewer project. For tax\n\npurposes, all payments to Mosley were deducted as business expenses on sewer\n\nprojects. Mosley did no work on those projects. After a local newspaper reported\n\nRAST’s construction work at JCESD Director Swann’s home, RAST amended its\n\ntax returns for 1998-2000 and 2002 to eliminate these and other deductions. The\n\ndeductions, which totaled over $140,000, were based on expenditures for McNair’s\n\nstudio and Swann’s home that had been cost-coded to sewer projects and treated as\n\nbusiness expenses.\n\n      After the publicity, Bobby Rast told his bookkeeper in “effect that we really\n\ndidn’t need any document invoices in the files with Jack Swann’s or Chris\n\nMcNair’s shipping address on them.” The bookkeeper then located and discarded\n\nseveral invoices related to work at McNair’s studio and Swann’s home.\n\n      RAST furnished the labor and PUGH furnished the materials to construct a\n\nsecond-story deck for the rear of McNair’s studio. Bailey handwrote a list of\n\nmaterials and ordered the necessary steel. When Besco Steel Supply (“Besco”)\n\ndelivered the steel, its delivery tickets identified PUGH and Yessick as its\n\ncustomers and indicated some of the steel was for the Valley Creek Treatment\n\nPlant, a JCESD sewer job on which PUGH was the contractor and FWDE the\n\nconsulting engineer. In September 2000, PUGH paid Besco and charged the\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fJCESD for $3,773 worth of steel with FWDE’s approval, and RAST poured the\n\nconcrete deck and stairs, set the handrails, and built the steps.\n\n      Around September 2000, FWDE employee Dave Bechtel ordered two sets of\n\naluminum handrails for the studio deck and a staircase from Thompson\n\nFabricating, which was directed to bill PUGH. The $5,500 invoice for the first set\n\nof handrails charged the work as performed on the Valley Creek Treatment Plant\n\nand falsely indicated that the handrails were shipped there. In February 2001, an\n\n$11,700 invoice for the second set of handrails referenced “CHRIS MC.” as the\n\ncustomer, but also falsely indicated that the handrails were shipped to Valley Creek\n\nwhen in fact they were shipped to McNair’s studio. PUGH paid both invoices and\n\nbilled the County for the first set of handrails after adding a markup and charges\n\nfor labor and equipment. RAST installed the handrails.\n\n      In May 2000, at McNair’s request to Roland Pugh, Grady Pugh flew\n\nMcNair’s daughter and FWDE’s Bailey on PUGH’s airplane to Georgia, where\n\nthey picked out carpet for McNair’s studio. Before take-off, Roland Pugh told his\n\nson Grady Pugh that “McNair has called [again] and says that he’s broke and he\n\ndoesn’t have enough money to leave for the deposit on the carpet” and “[s]o, if you\n\nwould, write a check for the deposit.” Grady Pugh paid the deposit with a $4,820\n\nPUGH check made out to the Mill Store and had it treated on PUGH’s books as an\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fexpense on the “last rehab contract.”12\n\n       FWDE’s Bailey hired subcontractor Clint Gilley to install the carpet at\n\nMcNair’s studio. In October 2000, FWDE’s Bailey called RAST to request checks\n\nfor subcontractor Gilley. After Bobby Rast was consulted, RAST gave Gilley two\n\nchecks totaling $5,301 for his work at McNair’s studio.\n\n       In addition to paying for materials and providing work crews, PUGH also\n\nmade other contributions to McNair’s studio. When the project began in 1999,\n\nRoland Pugh told PUGH’s other three owners, Grady Pugh, Andy Pugh, and\n\nYessick, they had to give money to McNair because he was building a studio and,\n\nas 10% owners of the PUGH company, they had to “kick in” their share. Grady\n\nPugh gave approximately $1,500 in cash to Roland Pugh’s secretary that time.13\n\n       12\n         The Indictment alleges as an overt act on Count 1: “On or about May 24, 2000,\nDefendant ROLAND PUGH instructed Grady Pugh to fly an airplane owned by Defendant\nPUGH, INC. to LaGrange, Georgia, to buy carpet and flooring material for the benefit of\nDefendant McNAIR. . . . On or about May 24, 2000, Defendant ROLAND PUGH caused Grady\nPugh to pay $4,820 to The Mill Store, Inc. for carpet and tile for installation at McNair Studio\nfor the benefit of Defendant McNAIR.”\n       13\n          The government also presented evidence of cash allegedly given to McNair. Roland\nPugh collected money from the other owners to give to McNair. On July 18 and 19, 2000,\nRoland Pugh, Grady Pugh, and Yessick wrote checks to cash (totaling $9,000) in proportion to\ntheir ownership interests. Roland Pugh gave Grady Pugh an envelope of money and asked him\nto give it to McNair. Grady Pugh took the envelope to the studio where he saw Bailey and told\nhim he was there to help McNair. Grady Pugh stated the money was “financial help” that\nMcNair needed at that time. Grady Pugh then met with McNair for a few minutes and left the\nenvelope with McNair.\n        When the studio needed an air conditioning system, McNair again called Roland Pugh\nasking PUGH to pay for it. Roland Pugh told Grady Pugh that McNair needed $40,000, but that\n“y’all don’t have to put up any money this time, I’m going to do it in a different way.” Roland\nPugh gave a $10,000 check dated December 22, 2000 to Grady Pugh’s wife, Genae Pugh, who\n\n                                               20\n\f       McNair also wanted a security gate for the studio. In August 2000, Danny\n\nRast hired subcontractor Master Access Controls (“MAC”) to install an electronic\n\ngate and agreed that RAST would provide the electrical conduit, wiring, and\n\nconcrete pad for the gate’s motor. MAC met with FWDE’s Bailey at McNair’s\n\nstudio site, installed the gate, and sent its invoices to the attention of Danny Rast.\n\nRAST paid the subcontractor $5,866.92. McNair paid nothing.\n\n       Also in December 2000, at Danny Rast’s request, RAST gave Bailey &\n\nSons’ Bobcat Service, owned by Danny Bailey, a $5,500 check for landscaping at\n\nMcNair’s studio. However, RAST’s records indicated Danny Bailey was working\n\non a JCESD sewer project. Although Danny Bailey had done work for RAST\n\nbefore, he did not send the invoice for the studio work through regular billing, as\n\nhe normally would, but instead sent it “Atten Dan Rast.”14\n\n\ncashed it and gave the money to Roland Pugh. That same day, Roland Pugh wrote a $10,000\ncheck to Angie Pugh (Andy Pugh’s wife) and a $9,750 check to cash. A week earlier Roland\nPugh had written a $9,000 check to cash. Around Christmas 2000, at Roland Pugh’s request,\nGrady Pugh picked up another envelope containing cash from Roland Pugh’s secretary, went to\nMcNair’s house, spoke with him for a few minutes, and put the money down on a couch with\nMcNair watching.\n       It appears from the closing arguments that all of the above cash and checks relate to\nCounts 4, 13 and 14 (on which the defendants were acquitted).\n       14\n          Huffman Electric was hired to do electrical work at McNair’s studio by FWDE but was\ntold to bill RAST. When Huffman sent an $11,252 invoice to RAST in November 1999 without\nmaking it to the attention of Bobby or Danny Rast, RAST’s vice president, Roy Weaver,\nresponded that they “have no job at this location.” Huffman then began billing McNair directly.\nAt first McNair paid the bills, but he eventually fell behind in his payments and owed\napproximately $45,000 by July 2000. Around this time, Grady Pugh allegedly made a delivery\nof cash to McNair, and RAST took over paying for Mosley’s wood framing services.\n\n                                              21\n\f      In November 2000, McNair asked Dawson Engineering to contribute to the\n\nstudio’s renovation. After McNair called William Dawson, the founder of Dawson\n\nEngineering, the two met at McNair’s studio. McNair handed Dawson a brochure\n\nfor an audiovisual system and told Dawson that, while McNair had “never asked\n\n[Dawson] for anything before,” he needed to ask Dawson to “help [him] with\n\nsomething.” McNair opened the brochure to a specific page, showed it to Dawson,\n\nand indicated he wanted Dawson to pay for the equipment and its installation.\n\nDawson went to Holt Audio Video (“Holt”) and purchased the equipment for\n\n$16,400. Dawson testified he would not have done this for McNair if McNair had\n\nnot been associated with the sewer rehabilitation process. When Dawson saw the\n\ninvoice indicated the bill was for Dawson Engineering but the shipment was for\n\nMcNair’s studio, he became “uncomfortable with the whole situation” and asked\n\nHolt to alter the shipping information by putting a sticker over the McNair studio’s\n\naddress, which Holt did. Dawson later pled guilty to conspiring to commit bribery.\n\n      Work at the studio continued after Commissioner McNair retired in March\n\n2001. FWDE’s Bailey hired Buchanan Plumbing and Sewer Service (“Buchanan”)\n\nto plumb the “guard shack.” In November 2001, FWDE employees signed\n\nBuchanan’s $1,775 in invoices and sent them to RAST, which paid them. RAST\n\nrecorded the payments as “Plumbing Work at Kilsby Circle,” a sewer project, even\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fthough Buchanan never did any work there.\n\n       After McNair’s retirement, Roland Pugh told Grady Pugh “that GD [sic]\n\nMcNair has called again, and he wants us to do some work over in Arkansas” and\n\n“surely this is the last time we’ll have to do anything for him since he’s out of\n\noffice.” Grady Pugh flew with McNair to Arkansas to look at the site and plans.\n\nFollowing this visit, PUGH’s Yessick hired George Word, an Arkansas building\n\ncontractor, in August 2001 to build a 3,000-square-foot retirement home for\n\nMcNair. Both PUGH and FWDE paid for its construction.15 PUGH’s checkbook\n\ncarried the notation “Gift per Eddie [Yessick]. No job.” After McNair’s\n\nretirement, RAST also continued to perform work at McNair’s studio and paid\n\n$8,135.78 for McNair and his wife to take a cruise to Alaska in September 2001.16\n\nC.     Bribes of Chandler and Ellis\n\n       The Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants also gave, at no charge, goods,\n\n\n       15\n         After McNair’s retirement, PUGH paid George Word $44,192.75 in the first half of\nOctober 2001, and, at Yessick’s instruction, internally charged the expense to miscellaneous\njobs/construction materials. McNair told George Word that FWDE would make the next\npayment. On October 24, 2001, after FWDE’s bookkeeper Rick Brinson saw Dougherty\nspeaking with McNair in FWDE’s parking lot, Dougherty asked the bookkeeper to write a\n$50,000 check to a construction company. About 20 to 30 minutes later, George Word’s\n$50,000 invoice, dated a day earlier, arrived by fax. The bookkeeper wrote the check, gave it to\nDougherty, and made an extra copy of the paperwork and kept it at home. Upon being\nsubpoenaed for these records later, the bookkeeper searched FWDE’s records, but could not find\nthe invoice. The only copy he found was the extra one he kept at home.\n       16\n         After McNair’s retirement, on May 14 and 15, 2001, PUGH, FWDE, and Bobby Rast\neach gave McNair a check for $5,000 (totaling $15,000). Bobby Rast’s check was for a\n“retirement gift” and FWDE’s was for a “motor home.”\n\n                                               23\n\fservices, labor, materials, and other things of value to (1) JCESD Assistant\n\nDirector Chandler, and (2) JCESD Engineer and PRC Director Ellis. At a lunch,\n\nPUGH’s President Yessick offered to landscape Chandler’s home. Chandler at\n\nfirst refused, but weeks later Yessick offered again, and Chandler accepted. PUGH\n\nprovided crews and paid for the materials for the extensive landscaping, including\n\ngrading, drainage work, and new sod, as well as construction of a patio, walkway,\n\nand retaining walls. Chandler paid nothing for that work.\n\n        In October 2001, Yessick arranged and paid for a $610 condo rental for the\n\nChandler family vacation at the Pelican Beach Resort in Destin, Florida.17\n\nChandler asked for, and PUGH delivered, a load of sand for Chandler’s house for\n\nfree.\n\n        In the spring of 2002, Chandler asked Bobby Rast to help with his expenses\n\nfor a trip to Europe to attend technical conferences. Ellis planned to attend too. At\n\nRAST’s office, Bobby Rast gave Chandler an envelope containing $5,000 in cash\n\nand told Chandler to split the money with Ellis. Chandler had expected $250 to\n\n$500 and was “uncomfortable and thought about giving it back, but [he] didn’t.”\n\n\n\n\n        17\n        The government also presented evidence that in April 2000, PUGH’s Yessick invited\nChandler on a fishing trip to Bienville Plantation in Florida, where the trip was paid for by\nPUGH. Grady Pugh arranged to have Yessick and Chandler fly to Florida in the PUGH\ncompany’s airplane. The jury acquitted PUGH and Yessick on Count 70, which referenced this\ntrip.\n\n                                              24\n\fInstead, Chandler “eventually gave half” to Ellis.18 The Dougherty defendants also\n\ngave Chandler tickets to Disney World and a trip to San Antonio.\n\nD.     The Defense\n\n       For the most part, the defendants did not dispute that they provided, at no\n\ncharge, these goods, services, labor, materials, and other things of value to\n\nCommissioner McNair.19 Instead, the defendants argued they lacked the “corrupt”\n\nintent necessary for bribery and that the government had failed to prove the\n\nrequired quid pro quo for the benefits provided to McNair. The defendants also\n\nasserted they helped McNair based on their friendship with him or for goodwill. In\n\nsupport, defense witnesses testified to McNair’s decades-long friendship with\n\nRoland Pugh, Dougherty, and the Rast family, and described how the contractor-\n\ndefendants frequently performed work for McNair at no charge. The contractor-\n\ndefendants also contended their experience, skills, and business reputation were\n\nstrong enough so that they did not need to resort to bribery to win County\n\ncontracts.\n\n       The defense spent considerable time attacking the credibility of Grady Pugh,\n\n\n\n       18\n          Other JCESD employees also received cash from the contractors. Danny Rast gave\n$1,500-$2,000 in cash to JCESD Field Supervisor Larry Creel, who sometimes awarded\nemergency work. PUGH gave $500 in cash to Creel for airplane tickets after Creel asked for a\nflight on PUGH’s company airplane.\n       19\n            Roland Pugh is the only defendant to dispute that he gave anything to McNair.\n\n                                                 25\n\fincluding inconsistencies in his testimony. The defense suggested he was lying out\n\nof hatred for his father Roland Pugh and to obtain a favorable sentence\n\nrecommendation from the government.\n\n       The government countered the defendants’ corrupt-intent arguments by\n\noffering 404(b) evidence of similar items of value the same contractors had\n\nprovided for Swann, Wilson, and Barber (who were not defendants in the McNair\n\ntrial). The government argued the large scale and overall pattern of these payments\n\nwere inconsistent with the defendants’ claims that they were favors undertaken\n\nmerely out of friendship for McNair. The government also presented evidence that\n\nMcNair made numerous unexplained cash deposits.20\n\nE.     Jury’s Verdicts\n\n       Before sending the case to the jury, the district court dismissed several\n\nsubstantive counts that charged bribes to McNair after his retirement in March\n\n2001, and struck the corresponding overt acts from the conspiracy count (Count 1),\n\nreasoning that 18 U.S.C. § 666 (the bribery statute) could not apply when McNair\n\nwas no longer a public official.\n\n       In the McNair trial, the jury convicted defendants McNair, PUGH, Roland\n\n\n\n       20\n         In the McNair trial, the government did not explain the source of the cash deposits. But\nin the USI case, the government showed these cash deposits corresponded with cash withdrawals\nfrom USI, Singh, and Key. See US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1206.\n\n                                               26\n\fPugh, Yessick, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty on Count\n\n1 of conspiring to bribe McNair. Count 1 alleged 54 overt acts originally. Several\n\novert acts were dismissed pre-trial, but Count 1, as submitted to the jury, charged\n\n39 overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n      As to bribes by the Pugh defendants, the jury convicted defendant McNair\n\non these substantive bribery counts: 2 ($5,500 for hand railings) and 3 ($11,700 for\n\nhand railings). The jury convicted defendant PUGH on Count 15 (same hand\n\nrailing facts as Counts 2 and 3). The jury convicted defendants PUGH and Yessick\n\non Count 71 ($610 for Chandler condominium rental).\n\n      As to bribes by the Rast defendants, the jury convicted defendant McNair on\n\nthese substantive bribery counts: 5 ($52,990 for carpentry work by Barry Mosley),\n\n6 ($5,866 for security gate installation by Master Access Controls), 7 ($5,300 for\n\ncarpet installation by Clint Gilley), 8 ($5,500 for landscaping work by Bailey &\n\nSons), 9 (several thousand dollars for fabrication and construction of stairs), and 10\n\n(several thousand dollars for concrete deck construction). The jury also convicted\n\ndefendants RAST and Bobby Rast on Counts 19-22 (same facts as Counts 5-8,\n\nrespectively), 72 ($2,500 cash to Chandler by RAST and Bobby Rast), and 87\n\n($1,000 cash to Ellis by RAST and Bobby Rast). RAST was also convicted on\n\nCounts 23 (same facts as Count 9) and 24 (same facts as Count 10). The jury\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fconvicted defendant Danny Rast on Counts 19, 20, and 22 (same facts as Counts 5,\n\n6, and 8).\n\n       Defendant McNair was also convicted on Counts 11 ($27,434 by the\n\nDougherty defendants for project management and supervision by Bailey) and 12\n\n($16,400 by Dawson for installation of audio visual system). The jury convicted\n\ndefendants FWDE and Dougherty on Count 28 (same facts as Count 11).21\n\n       In summary, the jury convicted defendant McNair on the bribery conspiracy\n\ncount and ten substantive bribery counts. The jury convicted defendants PUGH,\n\nRoland Pugh, and Yessick on the bribery conspiracy count; defendant PUGH on\n\ntwo substantive bribery counts; and defendant Yessick on one substantive bribery\n\ncount. The jury convicted defendants RAST, Bobby Rast, and Danny Rast on the\n\nbribery conspiracy count; defendant RAST on eight substantive bribery counts;\n\ndefendant Bobby Rast on six substantive bribery counts; and defendant Danny Rast\n\non three substantive bribery counts. The jury convicted defendants FWDE and\n\nDougherty on the bribery conspiracy count and on one substantive bribery count\n\n\n       21\n         In the McNair trial, the jury acquitted defendant McNair on Count 4 ($30,000 cash from\nthe Pugh defendants), defendants PUGH and Yessick on Count 13 ($20,000 cash to McNair) and\non Count 70 ($1,000 trip for Chandler to Bienville Plantation, Florida), and defendants PUGH\nand Roland Pugh on Count 14 ($10,000 cash to McNair). The $30,000 in Count 4 appears to\nconsist of the cash in Counts 13 and 14.\n        The McNair jury also acquitted defendant Danny Rast on Count 21 ($5,300 bribe of\nMcNair for carpet installation through Clint Gilley), defendants RAST and Danny Rast on Count\n89 ($1,000 cash to JCESD employee Larry Creel), and defendants RAST and Bobby Rast on\nCount 126 (obstruction of justice in connection with withholding items from the grand jury).\n\n                                              28\n\feach. All defendants but Yessick appeal all conviction counts.\n\n                           III. THE SWANN TRIAL (05-544)\n\n       The Swann trial, held from September 19 to October 2, 2006, involved more\n\nthan $330,000 in bribes paid to County employee Swann by the Pugh, Rast, and\n\nDougherty defendants. The government called 25 witnesses, including Wilson,\n\nChandler, and Ellis. The defense called 20 witnesses, including Grady Pugh. No\n\nnamed defendants testified except for Swann.\n\n       The government’s witnesses described in great detail the bribes to Swann\n\nand how Swann financially helped the Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants in\n\ntheir contracts with and payments from Jefferson County. And to counter the\n\ndefendants’ lack-of-corrupt-intent defense, the government introduced 404(b)\n\nevidence describing bribes that the same Pugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants\n\ngave to McNair, Barber, Wilson, and Chandler.22\n\nA.     Swann Helps Contractor-Defendants\n\n       JCESD Director Jack Swann reported directly to Commissioner McNair. It\n\nwas Swann’s responsibility to implement the EPA consent decree, which included\n\nrecommending engineering firms to McNair and negotiating the scope and price of\n\n\n\n       22\n          For example, in the Swann trial, the government presented evidence about how RAST\nbought Barber a piece of land. This evidence is outlined later in this opinion under the Barber\ntrial evidence. Defendant Barber pled guilty to this charge.\n\n                                               29\n\fno-bid engineering contracts, such as with FWDE. Swann supervised the sewer\n\nwork and made recommendations to McNair for payment approvals and change\n\norders. Swann also was able to grant time extensions and field directives that\n\ngreatly benefitted RAST and PUGH.\n\n      For example, in May 1998, the JCESD awarded the Vestavia Trunk Sewer\n\nReplacement project to PUGH. PUGH’s failure to meet the project’s May 17,\n\n2000 completion date would trigger a liquidated damages clause, obligating PUGH\n\nto pay $1,000 per day. In March 2000, PUGH was running far behind schedule on\n\nthis project and requested a 120-day extension to the May 17 completion date.\n\nSwann initially denied PUGH’s request.\n\n      On June 13, 2000, PUGH renewed its request, this time for a 180-day\n\nextension. On July 10 — five days after PUGH’s Yessick hired Guthrie\n\nLandscaping (“Guthrie”) to landscape Swann’s property — Swann granted\n\nPUGH’s request for a 180-day extension to the May 17 completion date. Swann’s\n\nextension saved PUGH $180,000 in potential liquidated damages.\n\n      In July 2000, the JCESD awarded the Valley Creek Trunk Relief Tunnel\n\nproject (designed by FWDE) to RAST and its joint venture partner W.L. Hailey.\n\nIn December 2001, during the first phase of the project, RAST’s tunnel-boring\n\nmachine became stuck in the ground. An independent engineer concluded the\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\fmachine became stuck because RAST may have discounted certain information in\n\na geotechnical survey. And the JCESD’s supervising engineer faulted RAST for\n\nusing “the wrong machine.” Nevertheless, Swann authorized RAST to remove the\n\nmachine at a cost of $2.6 million to Jefferson County.\n\n      Further, Swann declined to invoke the performance bond against RAST,\n\nwhich would have guaranteed the project’s completion at the original contract\n\nprice of $27.8 million. Instead, RAST won a re-bid for an additional contract\n\nworth $23.8 million. Consequently, the County effectively paid RAST over $50\n\nmillion for work RAST was obligated to perform under the original $27.8 million\n\ncontract.\n\n      Swann also approved a lucrative field directive that benefitted PUGH\n\n($827,417) and three that benefitted RAST ($2,020,367). Although in the\n\nCounty’s internal accounting system Swann recorded the County’s payments to the\n\nRAST-Hailey joint venture for each of these field directives as payments for the\n\nValley Creek Tunnel Relief project, none of the field directives involved work on\n\nthat project. Swann also exercised great influence over the selection of engineers,\n\nlike FWDE.\n\nB.    Bribes of Swann\n\n      In 1998, Swann and his wife Nila purchased a house two doors down from\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\ftheir own residence. The Swanns lived in their residence while they renovated\n\ntheir new home. Between September 1998 and June 2002, the Swanns put over\n\n$600,000 worth of additions and improvements into their new home. FWDE,\n\nRAST, and PUGH provided Swann, at no charge, more than $330,000 in goods,\n\nservices, labor, and materials for that work. For certain improvements paid for by\n\nFWDE, Swann admitted he did not reimburse FWDE or Dougherty. As they had\n\ndone for the McNair studio project, the contractor-defendants worked together on\n\nSwann’s new home. While the work was going on, Swann periodically came over\n\nto observe the work at the new home. While Swann was recommending and\n\napproving JCESD actions worth millions of dollars, the contractor-defendants were\n\nproviding hundreds of thousands of dollars in materials and services to renovate\n\nand expand Swann’s new home.\n\n      Specifically, in the fall of 1998, Dougherty sent FWDE supervisors Wayne\n\nHendon and Bill Bailey to meet with Swann and his wife about plans to remodel\n\ntheir new home. Over the course of the three-year project, FWDE employees\n\ncontinually supervised the remodeling of the new home. From about October 1999\n\nto March 2001, FWDE paid employee John Stanger $28,839 for his work at\n\nSwann’s home. During that time period, FWDE’s Hendon spent half of every\n\nwork day supervising other contractors at Swann’s home and billed his time as a\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fnonpaying job. FWDE paid Hendon $94,090 for his work at Swann’s home. In\n\nthe fall of 1998, FWDE hired subcontractor Dudley Davis for framing, costing\n\nover $28,000. Dougherty visited the site periodically.\n\n      In the winter of 1999, Bobby Rast sent RAST superintendent Luke Cobb to\n\nsupervise RAST crews who did demolition work and poured concrete for Swann’s\n\nnew home. Bobby Rast had RAST employee Derek Houston serve as a point of\n\ncontact for RAST’s suppliers and subcontractors for Swann’s home and paid\n\nHouston $6,300 for his work there. In 2000, RAST paid its employees $18,867.20\n\nin miscellaneous labor costs for their work on Swann’s home and McNair’s studio.\n\nRAST avoided using Swann’s name on invoices, delivery tickets, and internal\n\naccounting reports, instead using his nickname, “Little Big Man.”\n\n      RAST also bought bricks and other materials, and paid different\n\nsubcontractors for installation of hardwood floors and stairs and exterior\n\nbrickwork, plumbing work, and painting. RAST paid $3,535 for flooring and\n\nstairs installation that Don’s Carpet One performed at Swann’s new home in 2000\n\nor 2001. In the fall of 1999, RAST paid $1,964 for brick and mortar work by\n\nAlabama Brick Delivery. In the fall of 2000, RAST paid Kimro Painting &\n\nServices, Inc. (“Kimro Painting”) $9,733 for painting work at Swann’s new home.\n\nIn May 2001, RAST paid $4,441.50 to Sherman International for concrete work.\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fThe delivery ticket for ready-mix concrete RAST purchased from Sherman\n\nInternational directed delivery to the Swann address but identified it as the “Rast\n\nResidence.” In October 2001, RAST paid Brown Mechanical Contractors, Inc.\n\n(“Brown Mechanical”) for $9,540 worth of plumbing work performed at Swann’s\n\nnew home. Bobby Rast had the payments to Brown Mechanical coded as expenses\n\nto RAST’s Jefferson County contracts for “Annual Rehab” and “Minor Pump\n\nStation.”\n\n      In the summer of 2000, PUGH began contributing to Swann’s new home\n\nremodeling. PUGH’s President Yessick hired subcontractor Aquatic Gardens to\n\ninstall a waterfall and koi pond at a cost of $7,422. Yessick told Aquatic Gardens\n\nto send its invoices to PUGH and not mention Swann by name.\n\n      Yessick hired other subcontractors for various work after Swann claimed to\n\nhave overpaid for the remodeling. Yessick hired Guthrie to help landscape\n\nSwann’s new home, and in July 2000 Guthrie gave an initial estimate of $40,000.\n\nPUGH’s book entries and invoices for Guthrie’s work on Swann’s home were\n\nnever kept in Swann’s name, but always under some other code. Yessick had\n\nPUGH’s accountant charge Guthrie’s expenses to “Metro Park Roadway,” a\n\nJefferson County job. By December 2001, PUGH had paid Guthrie $93,680 for its\n\nlandscaping work at the Swann home, which included $1,200 a month for ongoing\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\fweekly yard maintenance.\n\n       In January 2002, PUGH’s President Yessick asked Guthrie to stop\n\nsubmitting invoices to PUGH, and instead PUGH advanced Guthrie $47,000 for\n\nthree years worth of landscaping and maintenance on Swann’s new home; and\n\nGuthrie performed about $10,000 worth of work. Although PUGH’s manager of\n\naccounts testified she filed Guthrie’s invoices regularly and that PUGH kept these\n\nrecords for 5 to 7 years, the invoices were not found during the government’s\n\ninvestigation.23 In December 2001, Yessick used a PUGH check to buy $1,000\n\nworth of bookstore gift certificates for Swann.24\n\n       In August 2002, after Grady Pugh and Yessick heard rumors of a\n\ngovernment investigation, Guthrie was asked to stop working on Swann’s\n\nproperty, even though there was a balance remaining on the advance Yessick had\n\ngiven to Guthrie. At that time, Yessick directed his assistant to send an invoice to\n\nSwann’s mother-in-law for $12,572 for tree removal and “remodeling work.” In\n\n\n       23\n         Count 101 ($47,000 check from Guthrie) was dismissed on the government’s motion\nduring the third day of trial. On that trial day, Paul Guthrie (the owner of Guthrie) testified that,\neven though Guthrie received a $47,000 check from PUGH’s Yessick for Guthrie’s work at\nSwann’s home, Guthrie to date had done about $10,000 worth of work on Swann’s home, not\n$47,000. Swann was convicted on Count 52, which charges him with receiving approximately\n$100,000 in work done by Guthrie.\n       24\n         The government also presented evidence that Bobby and Danny Rast used at least\n$4,000 of RAST’s funds to pay for Swann’s expenses on two trips to England. Swann and the\nRast defendants were acquitted on Counts 59 (Swann accepted $3,015 trips to England and\nScotland) and 68 (Rast defendants paid Swann for those trips).\n\n                                                  35\n\fSeptember 2002, Yessick instructed his assistant to create an invoice, this time to\n\nSwann’s mother, for $46,684 of landscaping work. In November 2002, the\n\nSwanns paid PUGH this amount with checks drawn from joint checking accounts\n\nthe Swanns had taken out with their mothers, after taking out two home equity\n\nloans in each of their mothers’ names.25\n\nC.     The Defense\n\n       In the Swann trial, the defense basically was that the defendants lacked the\n\ncorrupt intent to commit bribery and acted at all times in good faith. The\n\ncontractor-defendants contended they performed work on Swann’s home out of\n\ngoodwill and without expecting anything in return. Swann argued he did not have\n\nan intent to be influenced by the things the contractor-defendants gave him.\n\n       In addition, the defendants presented evidence showing that Nila Swann\n\n(Swann’s wife) had an engineering background, acted as her own general\n\ncontractor, hired and supervised subcontractors, and initially paid the bills for the\n\nwork on the Swann home. Swann testified that Nila handled all of the couple’s\n\nfinancial matters and that he assumed she was paying for the work. According to\n\nSwann, Nila frequently changed her mind, was not a good manager, and disputed\n\nthe cost and scope of the work with the subcontractors. Dougherty and the Rast\n\n\n       25\n        The plan all along had been for the Swanns’ mothers to move into the old home after\nthe new home was built.\n\n                                              36\n\fbrothers were longtime friends of Nila and Jack Swann. Swann stated that\n\nDougherty and the Rast brothers stepped in only to offer advice and take over\n\nsupervision to make the work go more smoothly. The contractor-defendants\n\nclaimed that they paid several of these disputed bills to preserve their own business\n\nrelationships with the subcontractors and their expectation was that the Swanns\n\nwould eventually reimburse them. However, with the sole exception of PUGH’s\n\nbelated invoices to Swann for landscaping and remodeling work, there was no\n\nevidence that the Swanns paid the contractor-defendants for the work at their new\n\nhome.\n\n        As to the conspiracy charge, the defendants also claimed that the\n\ngovernment had not presented sufficient evidence to show an unlawful agreement\n\nbetween Swann and any of the contractor-defendants.\n\n        In the Swann trial, the government presented 404(b) evidence about similar\n\nitems of value the same contractor-defendants had provided to McNair for his\n\nstudio, their help with McNair’s home in Arkansas, and other benefits they\n\nprovided for McNair, Barber, and Chandler.\n\nD.      Jury’s Verdicts\n\n        The jury convicted defendants Swann, PUGH, Yessick, RAST, Bobby Rast,\n\nFWDE, and Dougherty of conspiring to bribe Swann (Count 51).\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f       The jury convicted Swann on these substantive bribery counts: 52 ($100,000\n\nfrom PUGH through subcontractor Guthrie Landscaping), 53 ($7,422 from PUGH\n\nthrough subcontractor Aquatic Gardens), and 54 ($1,000 in gift certificates to\n\nAlabama Book Smith from PUGH). The jury convicted defendants PUGH and\n\nYessick on Counts 61-63 (same facts as 52-54, respectively).\n\n       The jury convicted defendants Swann, PUGH, and Yessick on Counts\n\n90-100 (honest services mail fraud involving PUGH’s paying $93,680 in checks to\n\nGuthrie for landscaping work performed for Swann).\n\n       The jury also convicted defendant Swann on Counts 57 ($9,733 in painting\n\nby Kimro Painting from RAST) and 58 ($8,940 in plumbing by Brown Mechanical\n\nfrom RAST) and defendants RAST and Bobby Rast on Counts 66 and 67 (same\n\nfacts as Counts 57 and 58, respectively).26\n\n       The jury also convicted defendant Swann on Count 60 ($24,176 for\n\nconstruction supervision by FWDE’s Stanger) and defendants FWDE and\n\n\n\n\n       26\n         In the Swann trial, the jury acquitted defendant Danny Rast on Count 51 (conspiracy to\nbribe Swann), on Count 66 ($9,733 in painting work for Swann by Kimro Painting) and on\nCount 67 ($8,940 in plumbing work for Swann by Brown Mechanical).\n        The jury also acquitted defendant Swann on Count 59 ($3,015 bribe received by Swann\nfrom the Rast defendants in the form of England and Scotland trips); defendants RAST, Bobby\nRast, and Danny Rast on Count 68 ($3,015 bribe given to Swann in the form of England and\nScotland trips); and defendant PUGH on Count 125 (obstruction of justice).\n\n                                               38\n\fDougherty on Count 69 (same facts as Count 60).27\n\n       In summary, the jury convicted defendant Swann on the bribery conspiracy\n\ncount, six substantive bribery counts, and eleven honest services mail fraud counts.\n\nThe jury convicted defendants PUGH and Yessick on the bribery conspiracy count,\n\nthree substantive bribery counts, and eleven honest services mail fraud counts. The\n\njury convicted defendants RAST and Bobby Rast on the bribery conspiracy count\n\nand two substantive bribery counts. The jury convicted FWDE and Dougherty on\n\nthe bribery conspiracy count and one substantive bribery count. Defendants\n\nSwann, PUGH, RAST, Bobby Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty appeal all conviction\n\ncounts.\n\n\n\n\n       27\n          When the Indictment was severed into the five separate cases for trial, Counts 107-121\nof the Indictment were scheduled to be tried in the Wilson trial (05-545). The government later\ndismissed Counts 107-121 and re-filed them essentially as Counts 1-17 in a new indictment\ndocketed as case number 06-084. This case (06-084) was consolidated for trial with the Swann\ntrial (05-544).\n         The Swann jury heard evidence on these 17 counts of honest services mail fraud under 18\nU.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1346. In November 1999, Wilson resigned from the JCESD and formed his\nown engineering consulting firm, CEDS. With Swann’s help, Wilson immediately obtained two\nno-bid engineering contracts ($483,000 and $350,000) from the County worth a total of\n$833,000. To get around “revolving door” provisions in Alabama’s ethics law that prohibited\nformer employees from doing business with the County for two years, Wilson made\narrangements for his firm to operate as FWDE’s “subcontractor.” FWDE was awarded the\ncontracts. Even though Wilson’s firm performed the work, FWDE passed Wilson’s invoices on\nto the County under FWDE’s own name. These 17 counts of honest services mail fraud related\nto money paid to CEDS.\n         Wilson and CEDS pled guilty to one count each and are not defendant-appellants in the\nSwann appeal. The Swann jury acquitted Swann, FWDE, and Dougherty on these 17 counts\ninvolving money paid to CEDS through FWDE. This evidence was introduced only in the\nSwann trial, not in the Wilson trial.\n\n                                               39\n\f                       IV. THE WILSON TRIAL (05-545)\n\n      In the Wilson trial, held from June 1 to 13, 2006, defendants Wilson and\n\nPUGH were charged with conspiring to commit bribery (Count 75). Defendant\n\nWilson was charged with accepting from PUGH a $4,500 bribe in the form of a\n\nscholarship for his son to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham\n\n(“UAB”) (Count 76). The defense argued that the scholarship was not intended as\n\na bribe.\n\n      The government called 9 witnesses, including Chandler, Grady Pugh, and\n\nRoland Pugh’s secretary Janice Kuykendall. The defense called 3 witnesses.\n\nA.    Wilson Helps PUGH\n\n      Defendant Wilson was the Chief Civil Engineer for the JCESD and served\n\non the PRC. As Chief Civil Engineer, Wilson was in charge of all sewer line work.\n\nWilson was also the project engineer on several construction contracts, including\n\nsome of PUGH’s. As project engineer, defendant Wilson approved all sewer\n\ncontractor pay requests, which were submitted monthly, before sending them on to\n\nChandler, the JCESD’s Assistant Director. Project engineers also approved\n\nrequests for extensions of time to complete contracts. Contractors were subject to\n\na penalty of $1,000 per day if they failed to complete a contract on time.\n\n      On July 26, 1999, PUGH submitted to USI — the outside consulting\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fengineer for the “Village East 3” contract — a request for a 175-day extension to\n\ncomplete work on the project. The completion date was May 11, 1999. On July\n\n27, 1999, USI forwarded the request to defendant Wilson. When PUGH requested\n\nthe 175-day extension on July 26, it was already 76 days overdue. PUGH was at\n\nrisk for a $76,000 penalty — $1,000 in liquidated damages for each of the 76 days.\n\n      On August 20, 1999, defendant Wilson faxed Grady Pugh a letter instructing\n\nhim to send $4,500 to UAB for Wilson’s son. On August 23, defendant Wilson\n\napproved the extension. This saved PUGH not only the $76,000 penalty for the\n\ndelay from May 11 to July 26 but also $1,000 per day for each day until PUGH\n\ncompleted the job. On August 24, 1999, PUGH sent a $4,500 check to UAB for\n\nWilson’s son.\n\n      In addition, defendant Wilson served on the PRC, which set technical\n\nstandards for construction firms who bid on contracts for the County’s sewer\n\nproject. Some of the projects called for “cured-in-place” (“CIP”) or “trenchless”\n\ntechniques for replacing existing sewer lines. In the late 1990s, this was a\n\nrelatively new technology, and only a handful of contractors had the expertise to\n\ndo it properly. Like other municipalities, Jefferson County required contractors to\n\nmeet specified minimum requirements for prior experience before they were\n\npermitted to bid on CIP work.\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f      In September 1999, the PRC significantly tightened these requirements,\n\nmaking it more difficult for new contractors to pre-qualify. However, the three\n\ncontractors who were already doing CIP work in Jefferson County were\n\ngrandfathered in and did not have to go through the pre-qualification process. Two\n\nof those three CIP contractors were joint venture partners with RAST and PUGH.\n\nAlthough the three contractors did compete against each other in a sealed bidding\n\nprocess, Jefferson County’s qualification requirements cut down the number of\n\ncompetitors and enabled these CIP contractors to charge Jefferson County higher\n\nprices than they could charge other municipalities for similar work. When two\n\nnon-local competitors finally qualified to join the bidding in 2001, prices quickly\n\ndropped from over $50 per linear foot to about $28.\n\n      The government also offered 404(b) evidence showing certain items of value\n\nthat PUGH provided for McNair, Chandler, and Barber, and that RAST provided\n\nfor Wilson,28 and the favorable decisions PUGH obtained from the JCESD. Grady\n\nPugh offered similar testimony, and, as in the McNair trial, the defense again\n\nattempted to impeach Grady Pugh by pointing out inconsistencies in his testimony,\n\nhis hatred of his father (Roland Pugh), and his efforts to obtain a favorable\n\nsentencing recommendation from the government.\n\n\n\n      28\n           RAST paid for Wilson to spend a week in London and a weekend in Paris with his wife.\n\n                                               42\n\fB.    Bribes of Wilson\n\n      Sometime in mid-1999, defendant Wilson complained to Grady Pugh over\n\nlunch about the cost of college and that he might not be able to afford to send his\n\nson Justin to UAB for the upcoming semester (fall 1999). Grady Pugh responded\n\nthat PUGH “had done a lot” for “colleges and education” and suggested PUGH\n\nmight “sponsor a scholarship,” but wanted to make sure “we couldn’t get in any\n\ntrouble for it.” Sometime in August 1999, Wilson called Grady Pugh to accept the\n\nscholarship offer.\n\n      As noted above, on August 20, 1999, defendant Wilson used a JCESD fax\n\nmachine to send Grady Pugh a letter expressing his gratitude and instructing him to\n\nsend a $4,500 check to UAB to credit Wilson’s son’s account. PUGH sent the\n\ncheck to UAB four days later. There was no evidence that the son ever sent PUGH\n\nan application for the scholarship. Grady Pugh’s secretary typed the letter and\n\nsigned Grady Pugh’s name. Grady Pugh never met nor spoke with Wilson’s son\n\nbefore sending the $4,500 check to UAB on August 24, 1999. The accompanying\n\nletter simply asked UAB to credit the payment to Wilson’s son’s account and gave\n\nno other instructions. Although PUGH had made charitable contributions to\n\nschools and colleges, including UAB, it had never previously awarded a\n\nscholarship to an individual student. Grady Pugh thought the money would go\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\ftoward “books and tuition” but could not remember exactly what Wilson had said\n\nto him.\n\n          Grady Pugh was unaware that FWDE had already paid Wilson’s son’s\n\ntuition and fees for the 1999-2000 school year.29 UAB applied PUGH’s\n\nscholarship money to Wilson’s son’s account in four quarterly installments of\n\n$1,125 per installment, as was its standard practice for scholarships when a donor\n\ndid not instruct otherwise. UAB took about one third of the PUGH money to cover\n\nthe son’s housing and other fees, and disbursed the remainder of the PUGH money\n\ndirectly to the son each quarter. The installments were disbursed to the son in\n\nSeptember 1999, December 1999, March 2000, and June 2000. Wilson’s son\n\nsigned a receipt each time. Grady Pugh testified that he never did anything after\n\nAugust 1999 to follow up on the “scholarship” and he did not know that UAB\n\nwould defer full payment into the following year. The government did not present\n\nany evidence that Wilson was aware of UAB’s payment arrangements.\n\n       Grady Pugh explained his intent in giving the scholarship to Wilson’s son:\n\n       When you offer somebody something like that . . . you expect them to\n       help you if they can. And when I did that for [Wilson], I felt like if he\n       got a chance to help us, he would.\n\nGrady Pugh explained that giving things of value to County employees provided\n\n\n       29\n         The government did not allege there was anything improper about the FWDE\nscholarship.\n\n                                            44\n\fPUGH with the “general benefit” of “hav[ing] preferential treatment and, you\n\nknow, if we had problems it would help resolve the problems. Numerous ways\n\nthat things could be made easier.”\n\nC.     Jury’s Verdicts\n\n       The jury convicted defendants Wilson and PUGH on Count 75 and\n\ndefendant Wilson on Count 76. Wilson has not appealed. PUGH appeals as to\n\nCount 75.30\n\n                          V. THE BARBER TRIAL (05-542)\n\n       In the Barber trial, held from January 8 to 17, 2007, defendants Barber,\n\nPUGH, Roland Pugh, and Yessick were charged with conspiring to bribe Barber\n\nby, among other things, PUGH’s paying and Barber’s accepting $47,927 in real\n\nproperty and nearly $1,200 in trips to casinos and beaches (Count 78). Defendants\n\nPUGH and Roland Pugh were also charged with bribing Barber by giving him that\n\n$47,927 property (Count 83), and defendant PUGH was charged with paying for\n\nthese trips (Counts 84-86).31\n\n       Defendants Barber and Yessick pled guilty to Count 78. Only PUGH and\n\n\n\n       30\n         Count 77 charged PUGH with the substantive offense of bribing Wilson with the\nscholarship, but was dismissed before trial on the government’s motion.\n       31\n        The trips were to Isle of Capri Casino, Vicksburg, Mississippi ($148), Beau Rivage\nResort & Casino, Biloxi, Mississippi ($546), and Phoenix III Condominiums, Gulf Shores,\nAlabama ($481).\n\n                                              45\n\fRoland Pugh went to trial. The government called 7 witnesses, including\n\nChandler, Grady Pugh, and Yessick. The defense called 7 witnesses, including\n\nBarber.\n\nA.    Barber Helps PUGH\n\n      Barber supervised the JCESD’s twenty-six job-site County inspectors.\n\nBarber was responsible for hiring sewer contractors to do no-bid emergency work,\n\napproving contractors’ paperwork, and certifying their expenses before sending the\n\nexpenses to JCESD Assistant Director Chandler.\n\n      In January 2000, Barber determined the sewer pipes in the Paradise Lake\n\nsubdivision should be replaced on an emergency basis instead of being repaired.\n\nOn January 7, Barber told City Inspector Hodges that Barber had chosen a\n\ncontractor who could do the job in about 45 days. PUGH’s President Yessick sent\n\nBarber a letter, dated January 27, 2000, offering that PUGH could do the job for\n\nabout $1.2 million. That same day, Yessick also sent Hodges a letter, dated\n\nJanuary 27, 2000, stating that PUGH would be performing the job. Given that\n\nemergency work contracts were limited to $50,000 or less, PUGH eventually\n\nreceived a no-bid field directive in the amount of $857,000, on which PUGH made\n\na 50% profit. However, because Barber had classified the work as an emergency,\n\nthere was no contract for Paradise Lake on which to put the field directive. The\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\femergency work contract therefore was placed on the unrelated multi-million-\n\ndollar Cahaba River project.\n\nB.    Bribes of Barber\n\n      Beginning in 1997 and continuing through 2001, PUGH’s President Yessick\n\ncaused PUGH to pay to send Barber on an annual beach resort or casino vacation\n\nin locations including Orange Beach, Alabama and Biloxi and Vicksburg,\n\nMississippi. PUGH paid $148 for Barber’s stay in Vicksburg, $546 for his stay in\n\nBiloxi, and $481 for his stay at the Phoenix III Condominiums in Orange Beach,\n\nAlabama. PUGH recorded the payments for the trips to Orange Beach and Biloxi\n\nin PUGH’s books as sewer “rehab” projects.\n\n      In the spring of 2000, Barber asked PUGH’s Yessick if he would find and\n\npurchase a piece of property in McCalla, Alabama on which Barber could retire.\n\nYessick consulted a realtor for this purpose, visited several properties himself, and,\n\nin November 2000, signed a contract to purchase land in the name of “Roland\n\nPugh” for $47,500. The next week, Yessick gave the realtor a check for $1,000,\n\nsigned by PUGH’s CFO Lorelei Heglas. In anticipation of the cost PUGH would\n\nincur for the land purchase, Yessick instructed PUGH CFO Heglas to charge\n\n$45,000 to the Paradise Lake project.\n\n      However, days before closing, Roland Pugh’s administrative assistant Janice\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\fKuykendall told Yessick that PUGH no longer intended to buy the land in PUGH’s\n\nname but instead planned to give Barber a cashier’s check to buy the land in his\n\nown name. PUGH assistant Kuykendall told Yessick to travel to Tuscaloosa to get\n\nthe check and then take back from the realtor all documents referring to PUGH.\n\n      PUGH’s Yessick got the check, which was made out to the settlement\n\nattorney for $46,877, and on which the “NAME OF REMITTER” line was left\n\nblank. Yessick then gave Barber the check. Barber closed on the land contract in\n\nhis own name on December 18, 2000. Yessick also gave Barber a cashier’s check\n\nfor $1,050 to replace the check he gave to the realtor. The realtor prepared papers\n\nto refund PUGH’s deposit.\n\n      In September 2002, a newspaper article revealed an investigation into PUGH\n\nand Barber. Six months later, over a seven-week period, Barber sent PUGH a\n\nseries of checks amounting to $46,877. Yet Barber paid no interest, and there was\n\nno evidence of any document indicating a loan.\n\n      At trial Yessick testified that he paid the charged bribes in the hope that\n\nBarber, who supervised the JCESD’s job-site inspectors, would assist if PUGH\n\nwere to have a problem with an inspector being “irrational.” Counsel for PUGH\n\nand Roland Pugh argued that they did not provide things to Barber with the intent\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fto influence him.32 The government presented 404(b) evidence showing that\n\nPUGH’s Yessick paid for Chandler to go on a fishing vacation, that Grady Pugh\n\nbought a carpet for McNair, that Grady Pugh made cash payments to McNair, and\n\nthat PUGH worked on McNair’s home in Arkansas.\n\nC.     Jury’s Verdicts\n\n       The jury convicted PUGH on Counts 78 (bribery conspiracy), 83 ($47,927\n\nin real property), and 84-86 (trips). Roland Pugh was acquitted on Counts 78 and\n\n83, the only counts against him in the Barber trial. PUGH appeals all conviction\n\ncounts.\n\n                              VI. QUID PRO QUO ISSUES\n\n       All defendant-appellants argue that their bribery convictions under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 66633 must be vacated because the Indictment failed to allege, and the\n\ngovernment failed to prove, the contractor-defendants gave specific benefits to\n\nCounty employees in exchange for, and with the intent that, the employees perform\n\n\n\n\n       32\n          Defendant Roland Pugh called Barber to testify that he (Barber) never met Roland Pugh\nuntil after the relevant time period and that Barber did not have an intent to be influenced by the\ntrips that PUGH bought for him.\n       33\n         The defendant-appellants’ § 666 convictions are: (1) McNair, Counts 1-3, 5-12, 32; (2)\nSwann, Counts 51-54, 57, 58, 60; (3) PUGH, Counts 1, 15, 51, 61-63, 71, 75, 78, 83-86; (4)\nRoland Pugh, Count 1; (5) RAST, Counts 1, 19-24, 51, 66, 67, 72, 87; (6) Bobby Rast, Counts 1,\n19-22, 51, 66, 67, 72, 87; (7) Danny Rast, Counts 1, 19, 20, 22; (8) FWDE, Counts 1, 28, 51, 69;\nand (9) Dougherty, Counts 1, 28, 51, 69.\n\n                                                49\n\fa specific official act, termed a quid pro quo.34 The defendant-appellants also\n\nargue the district court erred, at a minimum, by refusing to charge the jury that the\n\ngovernment must prove a specific quid pro quo. We begin by reviewing the\n\nrelevant parts of § 666.35\n\nA.     18 U.S.C. § 666\n\n       Section 666 proscribes theft and bribery in connection with programs of\n\nlocal governments receiving federal funds.36 Section 666(a)(1)(B) criminalizes a\n\nlocal government employee’s “corruptly” soliciting or accepting a bribe:\n\n       (a) Whoever . . .\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          Black’s Law Dictionary defines quid pro quo as follows: “An action or thing that is\nexchanged for another action or thing of more or less equal value; a substitute.” Black’s Law\nDictionary 1367 (9th ed. 2009). Defendants argue the government must prove a specific or\nidentifiable thing of value was exchanged for a specific or identifiable official act.\n       35\n          The interpretation of a statute is a question of law we review de novo.

The\n\n       37\n          As to “agent,” the district court in the McNair trial charged the jury: “The term ‘agent’\nmeans a person authorized to act on behalf of a local government and includes an employee,\nofficer, manager or representative of a local government. Jefferson County, Alabama is a local\ngovernment of Alabama.” In the Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, the district court charged the\njury: “The term ‘agent’ as relevant to this case means any employee, officer, director, manager\nor representative of a local government. Jefferson County, Alabama, is a local government of\nAlabama.”\n       38\n            The $5,000 in § 666(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2) refers to the value of the “business, transaction,\nor series of transactions,” not the value of the bribe.

By listing the items of value received or\n\ngiven by the defendants, each count of the Indictment provides sufficient facts and\n\ncircumstances to give adequate notice of the charges to be defended against. Thus,\n\nwe readily determine the Indictment itself was not defective for failure to allege a\n\nspecific quid pro quo.\n\nB.    Paradies and US Infrastructure Decisions\n\n      Nonetheless, this does not resolve whether the language in § 666(a)(1)(B) or\n\n(a)(2) effectively requires the government to prove a specific quid pro quo to\n\nobtain a § 666 conviction. This question has been before this Court twice before\n\nbut only under plain error review, and even then, we did not squarely answer it.\n\nSee United States v. US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1212-14; United States v.\n\nParadies, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728163\"><a href=\"/opinion/728163/united-states-v-daniel-m-paradies-the-paradies-shops-inc-paradies/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n      In Paradies, the defendant claimed that the district court erred in failing to\n\ncharge the jury that a quid pro quo was an element required to convict under § 666\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\fId. at 1289. This Court did not decide if quid pro quo was an element but\n\nconcluded there was no reversible jury charge error because the jury charge tracked\n\nthe statutory language of § 666 and the defendant did not object to the charge. Id.\n\n      The Paradies Court also rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. Id. The Paradies Court stated: “the evidence at trial was sufficient for a\n\njury to find that Jackson [the official] accepted payments for his votes and his\n\ninfluence upon the City Council and the administration,” and “[s]uch a finding\n\nwould satisfy any quid pro quo requirement under the statute.” Id. In other words,\n\nParadies concluded that even if § 666 requires a quid pro quo, that requirement is\n\nsatisfied by showing a series of payments intended generally to influence the\n\nofficial’s decisions.\n\n      Subsequently, our United States v. US Infrastructure decision involved an\n\nappeal from the fifth trial (the USI trial, 05-543) that arose out of the Indictment\n\nhere. US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1202-03. The defendants in US Infrastructure\n\nargued the jury charges on the § 666 counts were erroneous because they did not\n\ninclude their proposed instruction that the jury must find a specific quid pro quo to\n\nconvict under § 666. Id. at 1213. This Court concluded that the district court “did\n\nnot commit plain error by refusing [defendants’] quid pro quo [jury] instruction.”\n\nId. at 1214. As its sole basis for this conclusion, US Infrastructure stated this\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\fCourt had already rejected this argument in two prior cases: “This Court has\n\nrejected the argument that the government must ‘show a direct quid pro quo\n\nrelationship between [the defendants] and an agent of the agency receiving federal\n\nfunds.’” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1214 (quoting United States v. Castro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71071\"><a href=\"/opinion/71071/united-states-v-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1454 (11th Cir. 1996), and citing Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1289). However,\n\nas shown above, Paradies did not actually make a holding to that effect. Neither\n\ndid United States v. Castro.39 Nonetheless, US Infrastructure itself holds a specific\n\nquid pro quo is not required for a § 666 conviction. Because US Infrastructure was\n\nonly plain error review, we now make the same holding but under de novo review.\n\n       We begin with the statutory language itself.40 Importantly, § 666(a)(1)(B)\n\nand (a)(2) do not contain the Latin phrase quid pro quo. Nor do those sections\n\n\n       39\n          In Castro, the issue was whether § 666(a)(2) required that the bribe-givers intended to\nenter into a direct exchange with an agent of an entity receiving the federal funds, or if it was\nsufficient that they offered the bribe to a third-person middleman with the intent to influence that\nagent by having that middleman authorize that agent to issue payments to the defendants.\nCastro, 89 F.3d at 1453-54. The Castro Court concluded that “influence” under § 666 could be\nexercised indirectly and that it was sufficient that the defendants intended to influence the agent\nby causing a middleman to authorize the agent to issue payments. Id. Although in reaching this\nconclusion the Castro Court stated, “[w]e reject appellants’ suggestion that the government had\nto show a direct quid pro quo relationship between [the defendants] and an agent of the agency\nreceiving federal funds,” id., Castro was addressing whether there was a “directness”\nrequirement between the bribe-giver and the agent and did not answer the question before us\nhere.\n       40\n         “When construing a criminal statute, [this Court] begin[s] with the plain language;\nwhere ‘the language Congress chose to express its intent is clear and unambiguous, that is as far\nas we go to ascertain its intent because we must presume that Congress said what it meant and\nmeant what it said.’” United States v.

To accept the defendants’ argument would\n\npermit a person to pay a significant sum to a County employee intending the\n\npayment to produce a future, as yet unidentified favor without violating § 666.\n\n       The requirement of a “corrupt” intent in § 666 does narrow the conduct that\n\nviolates § 666 but does not impose a specific quid pro quo requirement. In all the\n\ntrials consolidated in this appeal, the district court’s jury charge, with slight\n\nvariations, defined “corruptly” as follows: “An act is done ‘corruptly’ if it is\n\nperformed voluntarily, deliberately and dishonestly for the purpose of either\n\naccomplishing an unlawful end or result or of accomplishing some otherwise\n\nlawful end or lawful result by an[y] unlawful method or means.” It is acting\n\n“corruptly” — dishonestly seeking an illegal goal or a legal goal illegally — that\n\nseparates permissible from criminal. The addition of a corrupt mens rea avoids\n\nprosecution for acceptable business practices.41\n\n\n       41\n          We do not read the definitional language of “corrupt” to impose a quid pro quo\nrequirement. In any event, the district court charged that definition. It also has been suggested\nthat § 666’s language — a thing of value given with corrupt intent to influence — effectively\nconstitutes a quid pro quo in that the payment is made for influence. This at best would be\n“quid pro quo light.” Even if one views § 666 this way, the district court charged the language\nof the § 666 statute.\n\n                                                56\n\f       For all of these reasons, we now expressly hold there is no requirement in\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(B) or (a)(2) that the government allege or prove an intent that a\n\nspecific payment was solicited, received, or given in exchange for a specific\n\nofficial act, termed a quid pro quo.\n\n       As to the defendant County employees, the government must show only\n\nwhat § 666(a)(1)(B) says: that a County employee “corruptly” accepted “anything\n\nof value” with the intent “to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any\n\nbusiness, transaction, or series of transactions” of the County. And as to the\n\ncontractor-defendants, the government must show only what § 666(a)(2) says: that\n\nthe defendant “corruptly” gave “anything of value” to a County employee with the\n\nintent “to influence or reward” that person “in connection with any business,\n\ntransaction, or series of transactions” of the County.\n\n       To be sure, many § 666 bribery cases will involve an identifiable and\n\nparticularized official act, but that is not required to convict. Simply put, the\n\ngovernment is not required to tie or directly link a benefit or payment to a specific\n\nofficial act by that County employee. The intent that must be proven is an intent to\n\ncorruptly influence or to be influenced “in connection with any business” or\n\n“transaction,” not an intent to engage in any specific quid pro quo.42\n\n\n       42\n        The defendant-appellants rely on United States v.

In Siegelman, the district court\ngave a quid pro quo instruction in response to the defendant’s request.

Id. at 141-42. Although accepting a quid pro quo\n\nrequirement for a bribery conviction, the Second Circuit rejected Ganim’s claim\n\n\n       43\n          The defendant in Ganim was convicted of these “bribery-related crimes”: “(1) extortion\nin violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; (2) ‘honest services mail fraud’ in violation of\n18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 & 1346; (3) federal programs bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(b)\n[sic]; and (4) bribe receiving in violation of Connecticut General Statutes section 53a-148\n(collectively, the ‘bribery-related crimes’).” Ganim, 510 F.3d at 141. The Ganim opinion first\nanalyzed the quid pro quo issue collectively as to the bribery-related crimes. Id. at 141-42. It\nlater discussed the jury charges under an “Extortion” subheading, but much of that discussion\nrelated to all bribery-related crimes in the case. Id. at 142-47. Because Ganim discussed the\nbribery-related crimes collectively, it did not focus on the language of § 666(a)(1)(B).\n\n                                               59\n\fthat “a direct link must exist between a benefit received and a specifically\n\nidentified official act.” Id. at 142. The Second Circuit held “that the requisite quid\n\npro quo for the crimes at issue [which included § 666(a)(1)(B)] may be satisfied\n\nupon a showing that a government official received a benefit in exchange for his\n\npromise to perform official acts or to perform such acts as the opportunities arise.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Second Circuit added that “so long as the jury finds that\n\nan official accepted gifts in exchange for a promise to perform official acts for the\n\ngiver, it need not find that the specific act to be performed was identified at the\n\ntime of the promise, nor need it link each specific benefit to a single official act.”\n\nId. at 147.\n\n       The Second Circuit also explained that “requiring a jury to find a quid pro\n\nquo . . . ensures that a particular payment is made in exchange for a commitment to\n\nperform official acts to benefit the payor in the future,” and “[o]nce the quid pro\n\nquo has been established, however, the specific transactions comprising the illegal\n\nscheme need not match up this for that.” Id. at 147. The Second Circuit’s analysis\n\nlies somewhere beyond a no-quid pro quo requirement, as adopted by the Sixth,\n\nSeventh, and now the Eleventh Circuits, and the Fourth Circuit’s requirement.\n\nWhile the Second Circuit requires a quid pro quo, that requirement is satisfied by a\n\nquid (thing of value) in exchange for a promise to perform an unidentified, official\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\fact at some point in the future. Id. at 142-47. In other words, in the Second Circuit\n\nthe quo need not be specific or even identifiable at the time of the quid, and to that\n\nextent the Second Circuit arguably supports our conclusion. And to some extent,\n\nconfusion reigns in this area because courts often use the term quid pro quo to\n\ndescribe an exchange other than a particular item of value for a particular action.\n\nD.    Sun-Diamond and § 201\n\n      Because there is no support for the defendant-appellants’ quid pro quo\n\nargument in the text of § 666, they rely on how the Supreme Court interpreted a\n\ndifferent criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, in United States v. Sun-Diamond\n\nGrowers of California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118282\"><a href=\"/opinion/118282/united-states-v-sun-diamond-growers-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118282\"><a href=\"/opinion/118282/united-states-v-sun-diamond-growers-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999). However, Sun-\n\nDiamond does not address § 666, and there are significant differences in the text of\n\nthe two statutes (§§ 201 and 666).\n\n      The defendant Sun-Diamond was a trade association convicted of providing\n\n“illegal gratuities” under 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(1)(A) for having given tickets, meals,\n\nand other items to the federal Secretary of Agriculture. Id. at 401, 119 S. Ct. at\n\n1404-05. Section 201(c)’s illegal gratuity provision prohibited Sun-Diamond\n\nfrom: “giv[ing] . . . anything of value to any public official . . . for or because of\n\nany official act performed or to be performed by such public official . . . .” 18\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\fU.S.C. § 201(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).44 In Sun-Diamond, the district court\n\ncharged the jury it could convict if it found “Sun-Diamond provided [the\n\nSecretary] with unauthorized compensation simply because he held public office,”\n\nand that “[t]he government need not prove that the alleged gratuity was linked to a\n\nspecific or identifiable act or any act at all.” Id. at 403, 119 S. Ct. at 1405\n\n(emphasis added). The “point in controversy” was that the jury instructions\n\nsuggested that an illegal gratuity “did not require any connection between\n\n[defendant’s] intent and a specific official act.” Id. at 405, 119 S. Ct. at 1406.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond concluded that § 201(c) did require a\n\nlink between the gratuity and a specific “official act” because the statutory text\n\nprohibited gratuities given or received “for or because of any official act performed\n\nor to be performed” and then defined “official act” as “any decision or action on\n\nany question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy . . . .” Id. at 406, 119\n\nS. Ct. at 1407 (quoting § 201(c)(1)(A) and (a)(3)). And it was specifically this text\n\nof the illegal gratuity statute — “for or because of any official act” — that the\n\nSupreme Court in Sun-Diamond found to be “pregnant with the requirement that\n\nsome particular official act be identified and proved.” Id. at 406, 119 S. Ct. at\n\n1407 (emphasis added). In stark contrast, none of these phrases are used in\n\n\n\n      44\n           There is no threshold monetary requirement in §§ 201(b) or 201(c)(1)(A).\n\n                                                62\n\f§§ 666(a)(1)(B) or 666(a)(2).\n\n       We recognize that the Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond also distinguished\n\nbetween a § 201(b) bribery crime and a § 201(c) illegal gratuity crime. Id. at 404-\n\n05, 119 S. Ct. at 1406. The Supreme Court pointed out that bribery in § 201(b)\n\n“requires a showing that something of value was corruptly given, offered, or\n\npromised to a public official (as to the giver) or corruptly demanded, sought,\n\nreceived, accepted, or agreed to be received or accepted by a public official (as to\n\nthe recipient) with intent, inter alia, ‘to influence any official act’ (giver) or in\n\nreturn for ‘being influenced in the performance of any official act’ (recipient).” Id.\n\nat 404, 119 S. Ct. at 1406 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)). The Supreme Court\n\nexplained that “[t]he distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element.” Id.\n\nat 404, 119 S. Ct. at 1406. The Supreme Court explained further that in § 201:\n\n       Bribery requires intent “to influence” an official act or “to be influenced”\n       in an official act, while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be\n       given or accepted “for or because of” an official act. In other words, for\n       bribery there must be a quid pro quo – a specific intent to give or receive\n       something of value in exchange for an official act. An illegal gratuity,\n       on the other hand, may constitute merely a reward for some future act\n       that the public official will take (and may already have determined to\n       take), or for a past act that he has already taken.\n\nId. at 404-05, 119 S. Ct. at 1406 (emphasis added).45 The Supreme Court also\n\n\n       45\n         A bribe under § 201(b) is punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment, while the lesser\ncrime of illegal gratuity under § 201(c) is punishable by up to 2 years’ imprisonment. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b), (c).\n\n                                               63\n\fstated: “The District Court’s instructions in this case, in differentiating between a\n\nbribe and an illegal gratuity, correctly noted that only a bribe requires proof of a\n\nquid pro quo.” Id. at 405, 119 S. Ct. at 1406.\n\n      Although § 201(b) requires that a bribe be given or received to influence an\n\n“official act” or “in return for” an “official act,” § 666 sweeps more broadly than\n\neither § 201(b) or (c). Section 666 requires only that money be given with intent to\n\ninfluence or reward a government agent “in connection with any business,\n\ntransaction, or series of transactions.” 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(B) & (a)(2). Section\n\n666 does not say “official act” but says “any business, transaction, or series of\n\ntransactions.” Id. Section 666 does not say “in return for” or “because of” but says\n\n“in connection with.” Id.\n\n      More importantly, the Supreme Court in Sun-Diamond was concerned with\n\naccidentally criminalizing legal gratuities under § 201(c), such as giving a ball cap,\n\na sports jersey, or token gift to the Secretary of Agriculture “based on his official\n\nposition and not linked to an identifiable act.” Id. at 406-07, 119 S. Ct. at 1407;\n\nsee Ganim, 510 F.3d at 146 (“Undergirding the [Supreme] Court’s decision in Sun-\n\nDiamond was a need to distinguish legal gratuities (given to curry favor of an\n\nofficial’s position) from illegal gratuities (given because of a specific act).”). That\n\nconcern is diminished here because § 666 contains a corrupt intent requirement. In\n\n\n\n                                           64\n\fany event, as reasoned by the Second Circuit, “there is good reason to limit\n\nSun-Diamond’s holding to the statute at issue in that case, as it was the very text of\n\nthe illegal gratuity statute — ‘for or because of any official act’ — that led the\n\nCourt to its conclusion that a direct nexus was required to sustain a conviction\n\nunder § 201(c)(1)(A).” Ganim, 510 F.3d at 146. “Nor is there any principled\n\nreason to extend Sun-Diamond’s holding beyond the illegal gratuity context.” Id.\n\nE.    Rule of Lenity\n\n      We also reject defendant-appellants’ argument that the rule of lenity requires\n\nus to read a specific quid pro quo requirement into § 666. The rule of lenity may\n\napply in a number of different circumstances. For example, “[t]he rule of lenity is\n\napplied when a broad construction of a criminal statute would ‘criminalize a broad\n\nrange of apparently innocent conduct.’” United States v.

Section 666(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2)\n\ncriminalize only those acts done “corruptly,” and, indeed, § 666 provides a defense\n\nfor “bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or\n\nreimbursed, in the usual course of business.” 18 U.S.C. § 666(c).\n\nF.    Defendants’ Proposed Jury Charges\n\n      In the McNair, Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, all defendant-appellants\n\nrequested jury charges that included a quid pro quo requirement.46\n\n      46\n        For example, in the McNair trial, PUGH requested this instruction:\n      In order for you to find defendant [PUGH] guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable\n      doubt that [PUGH] gave something of value to Defendant McNair with the specific\n      intent of obtaining a quid pro quo, that is, that [PUGH] gave the item of value with\n      the specific intent to improperly cause Defendant McNair to commit a specific act\n      in favor of [PUGH], or with the specific intent of illegally rewarding Defendant\n      McNair for having previously committed such an act. In other words, the United\n      States must show that [PUGH] provided the item of value either (1) with the\n      expectation that Defendant McNair would improperly provide something specific in\n      return or (2) for the purpose of rewarding McNair for something improper that\n      Defendant McNair had previously done.\n      In the Swann trial, Bobby Rast, for example, requested this instruction:\n      [Y]ou must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Bobby Rast gave something of value\n      to Defendant Swann with the specific corrupt intent of obtaining a quid pro quo, that\n\n                                               66\n\f      In the McNair trial, the district court rejected the proposed quid pro quo\n\ninstructions, gave the Eleventh Circuit’s pattern jury instructions for § 666 as to\n\ncorruptly giving bribes, telling the jury:\n\n      As I’ve said, the defendants, other than Jewell C. “Chris” McNair, are\n      charged in various counts of violating a portion of Title 18, Section 666,\n      which makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to corruptly give,\n      offer or agree to give anything of value to anyone who is an agent of a\n      local government receiving significant benefits under a federal assistance\n      program intending to reward or influence that agent in connection with\n      any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such local\n      government involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\n      ....\n      Fifth: And this is another thing that the government would have to prove\n      beyond a reasonable doubt.\n      That each such gift, offer or agreement to give, that by each of those\n      gifts, offer or agreement to give, the Defendant [] corruptly intended to\n      reward or influence Jewell C. “Chris” McNair in connection with a\n      transaction, or series of transactions, with Jefferson County, Alabama,\n      which transaction or series of transactions involved something of value\n      of $5,000 or more.\n      Sixth: That in doing so, the Defendant [] acted corruptly.\n      An act is done “corruptly” if it is performed voluntarily, deliberately, and\n      dishonestly, for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or\n      result or of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by\n\n\n\n\n      is, that Bobby Rast gave the item of value with the specific corrupt intent to\n      improperly influence Defendant Swann to commit a specific official act in favor of\n      Bobby Rast, or with the specific corrupt intent of illegally rewarding Defendant\n      Swann for having previously committed such an act. In other words, the United\n      States must show that Bobby Rast corruptly provided the item of value either (1)\n      with the expectation that Defendant Swann would improperly provide some official\n      specific act or acts in return or (2) for the purpose of rewarding Jack W. Swann for\n      some specific improper official act or acts that Defendant Swann had previously\n      done.\n\n                                              67\n\f       an unlawful method or means.47\n\nThe district court also gave the pattern § 666 jury charge, with slight variations, as\n\nto corruptly receiving bribes. The judges in the subsequent trials (Swann,48\n\nBarber,49 and Wilson50 ) agreed with the district\n\n\n       47\n          See Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) at 180-81 (Offense\nInstruction 24) (2003). The district court instructed the jury the government must prove all\nelements of a § 666 crime, such as that McNair had to be an agent and the County had to receive\nover $10,000 in federal funds. We quote in the text only the part of the pattern charge about the\ncorrupt intent element.\n       48\n         In the Swann trial, the district court instructed the jury as to corruptly accepting bribes:\n       As to [the § 666 substantive bribery] counts the defendant Jack W. Swann can be\n       found guilty of [§ 666 bribery] only if all the following facts are proved beyond a\n       reasonable doubt.\n       ....\n       The fifth element which is common to all of those counts as the first four were, that\n       . . . by such acceptance or agreements, the defendant Jack W. Swann intended as to\n       the count under consideration to be influenced or rewarded in connection with a\n       transaction or series of transactions of Jefferson County, Alabama which transactions\n       or series of transactions involve something of value of $5,000 or more.\n       And six, that in so doing the defendant Jack W. Swann acted corruptly.\n       An act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily and deliberately and\n       dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result or of\n       accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by any unlawful method\n       or means.\nThe court gave a similar pattern § 666 jury charge as to corruptly giving bribes.\n       49\n         In the Barber trial, the district court instructed the jury as to only PUGH’s corruptly\ngiving bribes because Barber, the acceptor, pled guilty:\n       The defendant Roland Pugh Construction, Inc., can be found guilty of the offense\n       charging a violation of [§ 666(a)(2)] only if all the following facts are proved beyond\n       a reasonable doubt:\n       ....\n       Fifth, that by giving, offering, or agreeing to give things of value to Clarence R.\n       Barber, defendant Roland Pugh Construction, Inc., intended to influence or reward\n       Clarence R. Barber in connection with any business transaction or series of\n       transactions which involve something of $5,000 or more.\n       And, sixth, that in doing so, the defendant Roland Pugh Construction, Inc., acted\n       corruptly.\n\n                                                  68\n\fcourt’s ruling in the McNair trial and gave jury instructions that did not include\n\ndefendant-appellants’ requested quid pro quo instructions.51\n\n       Given our conclusion that § 666(a)(1)(B) and (2) do not require proof of a\n\nspecific quid pro quo, defendant-appellants’ proposed jury instructions containing\n\nthat requirement were incorrect statements of law. Thus, the district courts did not\n\n\n       ....\n       An act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily, deliberately, and\n       dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result, or\n       of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or result by any unlawful method or\n       means.\n       50\n         Because in the Wilson case only PUGH appeals, we quote the “corruptly giving” part of\nthe court’s jury charge:\n       The purpose of the plan alleged by the government in the indictment was also for the\n       defendant, Pugh Incorporated, through Grady R. Pugh, Jr., to corruptly give, offer,\n       and agree to give things of value to defendant Ronald K. Wilson with the intent of\n       influencing and rewarding him for supporting their interests in connection with the\n       J.C.E.S.D. sewer rehabilitation construction program in violation of [18 U.S.C.\n       § 666(a)(2)].\n       ....\n       Title 18 of the United States Code section 666(a)(2) makes it a federal crime or\n       offense for any person to corruptly give, offer, or agree to give anything of value to\n       any person with the intent to influence or reward an agent of a local government or\n       local governmental agency receiving significant benefits under a federal assistance\n       program, in connection with any business, transaction or series of transactions of\n       such local government or government agency involving anything of value of $5,000\n       or more.\n       ....\n       An act is done corruptly if it is performed voluntarily, deliberately, and\n       dishonestly for the purpose of either accomplishing an unlawful end or result or\n       of accomplishing some otherwise lawful result by any unlawful method or means.\n       51\n          “In considering the failure of a district court to give a requested instruction, the\nomission is error only if the requested instruction is correct, not adequately covered by the\ncharge given, and involves a point so important that failure to give the instruction seriously\nimpaired the party’s ability to present an effective case.” Svete, 556 F.3d at 1161 (quotation\nmarks omitted). The district court’s refusal to give a requested instruction is reviewed for abuse\nof discretion. Id.\n\n                                                69\n\fabuse their discretion in refusing them. See US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1213\n\n(determining omission of a specific quid pro quo requirement in § 666 jury\n\ninstruction was not plain error); Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1289 (same).\n\n       In the McNair trial, all defendant-appellants also requested that the jury be\n\ninstructed that if a thing of value was given out of friendship or merely to foster\n\ngoodwill and not to corruptly influence or reward, then a not-guilty verdict is\n\nrequired. After that request, the district court in the McNair trial supplemented the\n\npattern instructions with this:\n\n       Section 666 . . . does not prohibit all gifts by or to a public official, does\n       not prohibit all receipts -- does not prohibit receipt of all gifts by or to a\n       public official, but only gifts received with the corrupt intent to be\n       influenced or rewarded by that governmental official in connection with\n       a business or transaction or series of transactions of that governmental\n       entity involving $5,000 or more.[52]\n\nAfter the defendant-appellants insisted the district court specifically identify\n\nfriendship and goodwill gifts as legal gratuities, the court responded “if it’s corrupt\n\nand dishonest, it’s not for good will, is it?” The district court explained that giving\n\ndefendant-appellants’ instruction would “carr[y] with it some sort of suggestion\n\n\n\n       52\n         In the Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, PUGH also requested the same jury charge.\nThe Rast and Pugh defendants either requested this jury instruction or adopted PUGH’s request,\nin the Swann trial. And in the Swann, Barber, and Wilson trials, the district court gave similar\nsupplemental jury charges expressly advising the jury that § 666 does not prohibit all gifts to a\npublic official, but only those gifts with the corrupt intent to influence or reward specified\ngovernment officials in connection with the business or transaction or series of transactions of\nthat governmental entity.\n\n                                                70\n\fthat I’m adopting that idea that that’s what these payments were.” This exchange\n\nthen took place:\n\n       THE COURT:                                    What if it’s good will and corrupt?\n       [ROLAND PUGH’S COUNSEL]:                      It can’t be.\n       THE COURT:                                    Okay. That’s your answer.\n\nA finding that a gift was made or accepted with corrupt intent necessarily excludes\n\nfriendship and goodwill gifts. There is no reversible error in the court’s charge in\n\nthis regard.53\n\n                      VII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nA.     Conspiracy and Corrupt Intent\n\n       All defendant-appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support\n\ntheir convictions on various counts.54 Defendants’ primary arguments are the\n\ngovernment failed to prove a conspiracy among the defendants (as to Counts 1, 51,\n\n\n\n\n       53\n         We also find no merit to defendant-appellants’ claims on appeal as to any other\nproposed jury instructions because they were either incorrect, too argumentative or flawed in\nsome way, not necessary, or already adequately covered by the court’s charge as a whole. In\nparticular, we conclude the court’s charge adequately covered defendants’ theory of defense that\nthe payments were gifts made out of friendship or to foster good will and adequately charged the\njury on the honest services mail fraud counts (90-100) as discussed later.\n       54\n          “This Circuit reviews the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, examining the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the government and resolving all reasonable inferences and\ncredibility issues in favor of the guilty verdicts.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1203.

The defendants in the McNair and Swann trials mainly dispute\n\nwhether the government proved they acted (1) with corrupt intent (versus for\n\nfriendship), and (2) in agreement (versus independently). The government\n\npresented more than sufficient evidence of both corrupt intent and a conspiracy\n\nagreement.\n\n\n\n                                          73\n\f      First, ample evidence showed that the contractor-defendants worked together\n\non McNair’s studio and Swann’s home and that they did so with a common\n\npurpose of providing sizable benefits to influence McNair and Swann in the\n\nbillion-dollar sewer rehabilitation program. There was no evidence of gifts to\n\nthese “friends” before the sewer projects began. Instead, the gifts to McNair and\n\nSwann and other County employees were made during the same time period of the\n\nsewer projects. The large sums — both in bribes and sewer payments — indicate a\n\ncommon scheme of all defendant-appellants to receive County sewer money\n\nthrough illegal means. The jury was free to disbelieve the defendants’ claims of\n\ngifts for friendship and to find corrupt intent to influence McNair and Swann in\n\nconnection with the County’s massive sewer payments to the contractor-\n\ndefendants. The juries could readily believe the gifts worth hundreds of thousands\n\nof dollars to McNair and Swann after the sewer work began were actually bribes\n\nintended to make sure the contractors profited excessively from the work. In fact,\n\nthe evidence recounted above showed pervasive and entrenched corruption.\n\n      Second, the evidence of how the contractor-defendants divided up and\n\ncoordinated their work on the same personal projects for McNair (his studio) and\n\nSwann (his home) during the same time frame is strong evidence of a conspiracy.\n\nFor example, FWDE’s Bailey supervised the construction of McNair’s studio\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\fwhile PUGH and RAST provided labor and materials. RAST furnished the labor\n\nto build the deck, and PUGH furnished the materials. RAST excavated for the\n\nfootings, and PUGH ordered the concrete and poured concrete walls. FWDE paid\n\nMosley Construction for the wood framing initially, and then RAST began paying\n\nMosley. FWDE ordered the aluminum handrails, PUGH paid for them, and RAST\n\ninstalled them. The same pattern of dividing up the work was followed for the\n\nSwann home. For example, an FWDE employee supervised the work at Swann’s\n\nhome. PUGH’s Yessick hired a company to install a koi pond for Swann, and\n\nPUGH listed Danny Rast as a point of contact.56\n\n       Third, the extent to which the parties went to conceal their bribes is powerful\n\nevidence of their corrupt intent. For example, evidence in the McNair trial showed\n\nFWDE employed Bailey as a full-time construction superintendent for the McNair\n\nstudio renovation and reported Bailey’s time as purportedly performed on a JCESD\n\nsewer project. FWDE concealed a $50,000 payment Dougherty made to\n\nsubcontractor George Word Construction for building McNair’s Arkansas\n\nretirement home.57 FWDE has no record of the transaction at all. The only\n\n\n\n       56\n        In addition, after McNair’s retirement, PUGH, FWDE, and Bobby Rast each gave\nMcNair a check for the same amount — $5,000 — all within a two-day period.\n       57\n         Earlier, PUGH had paid Word $44,192.75 in the first half of October 2001, and, per\nYessick’s instruction, internally charged the expense to miscellaneous jobs/construction\nmaterials. McNair told George Word that FWDE would make the next payment.\n\n                                              75\n\fexisting record of this transaction was made by a bookkeeper, who copied the\n\ninvoice and check and kept them at home because of his suspicions. FWDE also\n\nsupplied a construction superintendent, Hendon, for Swann’s home remodel. For\n\nnearly two years, Hendon was on FWDE’s payroll but actually spent half of every\n\nworkday at Swann’s home. FWDE’s Stanger replaced Hendon for an additional\n\nnine months. Dougherty was aware of this work at Swann’s home. FWDE paid a\n\nsubcontractor over $28,000 — with checks signed by Dougherty — to frame the\n\naddition to Swann’s home.\n\n      Likewise, RAST paid nearly $77,000 for materials and subcontractors for\n\nMcNair’s studio. RAST also supplied significant amounts of labor for McNair’s\n\nstudio, including excavating for the footings and constructing its deck and metal\n\nsteps. RAST hid these expenses by coding them to JCESD projects.\n\n      After a newspaper article revealed RAST’s work on Swann’s home, Bobby\n\nRast told his bookkeeper that they “didn’t need any document invoices in the files\n\nwith Jack Swann’s or Chris McNair’s shipping address on them,” causing her to\n\ndiscard these invoices. Before the article, RAST had treated its payments to\n\nMcNair and Swann as business expenses, deducting them on its tax returns. After\n\nthe article, RAST amended several years’ returns to eliminate more than $140,000\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\fof those deductions.58\n\n       Similarly, RAST crews performed demolition work and poured concrete for\n\nthe basement, walls, stairs, and elevator pit at Swann’s home. RAST also spent\n\nmore than $28,000 purchasing concrete and bricks and paying subcontractors to\n\nrepair the plumbing, paint Swann’s home, and install hardwood floors and stairs.\n\nAs with McNair, RAST concealed its work for Swann, in particular avoiding the\n\nuse of Swann’s name on invoices, delivery tickets, and accounting reports, and\n\ncoding the work and expenses either to miscellaneous or JCESD projects.\n\n       PUGH also concealed its work on McNair’s studio. For example, when\n\nBesco delivered steel to McNair’s studio, Besco’s delivery tickets identified PUGH\n\nand Yessick as its customer and indicated that some of the steel was for the Valley\n\nCreek Treatment Plant, a JCESD sewer job on which PUGH was the contractor\n\nand FWDE the consulting engineer.\n\n       Defendants claim they could not have intended to corruptly influence\n\nMcNair because his authority was purely “ministerial,” since he only ratified what\n\nJCESD officials below him (such as Swann) had already approved. Given\n\n\n\n\n       58\n          Sufficient evidence also supports the Rast defendants’ convictions for bribing Chandler\nand Ellis. First, Chandler asked Bobby Rast for money to attend technical conferences that Ellis\nwas also planning to attend. Instead of giving Chandler a check for $250-$500 as Chandler\nexpected, Bobby Rast gave Chandler an envelope containing $5,000 cash and told Chandler to\nsplit it with Ellis.\n\n                                               77\n\fMcNair’s ultimate authority and responsibility, a jury could infer McNair became a\n\n“rubber-stamp” for the defendants’ pay requests, field directives, and contract\n\nmodifications that crossed his desk because of the large sums in goods and services\n\nhe received from the contractor-defendants. And because he was responsible for\n\nplacing sewer items on the County Commission’s weekly agenda, McNair\n\ncontrolled every sewer matter requiring Commission approval.59\n\nB.     PUGH’s Challenges to Counts 75 and 78\n\n       PUGH challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to its bribery conspiracy\n\nconvictions on Count 75 (the Wilson scholarship) and Count 78 (land and\n\nvacations for Barber). However, ample evidence supports both convictions.\n\n       The evidence established that when Grady Pugh gave Wilson’s son the\n\nscholarship, he expected Wilson to return the favor. Grady Pugh testified that\n\nwhen he provided the Wilson scholarship, he “felt like if [Wilson] got a chance to\n\n\n\n\n       59\n          Defendants also contend the government failed to prove any specific payment (or work\non McNair’s studio or Swann’s home) was given or done in exchange for a specific official act\nby McNair or Swann. Because a specific quid pro quo is not an element of a § 666(a)(1)(B) or\n(a)(2) crime, there was necessarily no failure of proof as to that element.\n        Alternatively, even assuming these § 666 crimes require, as the Second Circuit concluded\nin Ganim, that the government prove payments or such work were given or done in return for a\npromise of as yet unidentified future conduct favorable to the contractor-defendants in their\nCounty sewer projects, the evidence overwhelmingly established such facts and thus any error in\nthe jury charge was harmless. And even under the Fourth Circuit’s approach in Jennings, which\nrequires a “course of conduct of favors and gifts flowing to a public official in exchange for a\npattern of official actions favorable to the donor,” the evidence here was sufficient, and thus any\njury charge error was harmless. Jennings, 160 F.3d at 1014.\n\n                                                78\n\fhelp us and return the favor, he would.” Only three days after Wilson faxed Grady\n\nPugh information as to where PUGH should send the scholarship check — and the\n\nday before Grady Pugh sent it — Wilson approved PUGH’s request for a time\n\nextension that had been sitting on Wilson’s desk for four weeks. When PUGH\n\nsubmitted its extension request, PUGH was already exposed to liability of $76,000\n\nin liquidated damages. The amount of exposure exceeded $100,000 by the time\n\nWilson actually granted PUGH’s request.\n\n      The evidence also supports the verdict that PUGH and Yessick conspired to\n\nbribe Barber. Barber oversaw all of the JCESD inspectors and awarded the no-bid\n\nemergency work contracts. In 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001, PUGH paid for\n\nBarber’s vacations, but hid the payments in the company’s books. PUGH readily\n\nagreed to Barber’s June 2000 request to buy him a lot for a retirement home.\n\nPUGH’s Yessick contracted for the lot in Roland Pugh’s name but charged\n\n$45,000 to the Paradise Lake project to pay for it. Then, just before the closing,\n\nPUGH instead gave Barber a cashier’s check to buy the lot in his own name. The\n\nremitter’s name was left blank on that check. Yessick was told to retrieve all\n\nevidence that PUGH was ever involved. This required the realtor to fabricate a\n\nfictitious house sale to refund the original $1,000 deposit.\n\n      Moreover, just months before Barber solicited PUGH for the purchase of the\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\flot, Barber designated the Paradise Lake project as an emergency. Because the\n\ncost of the project — $827,417.75 — greatly exceeded Barber’s $50,000\n\nemergency work approval limit, and because there was no Paradise Lake contract\n\non which to grant a field directive, the work was performed as a field directive on\n\nthe unrelated multimillion dollar Cahaba River project. PUGH netted a profit of\n\nmore than $400,000.\n\n      PUGH argues the Wilson scholarship and Barber land transaction are not\n\nbribery conspiracies, but merely “buyer-seller” transactions.

PUGH argues\n\nthat there was nothing agreed upon with Wilson or Barber outside of the one gift or\n\none buy-sell transaction. The drug cases of Mercer and Dekle are materially\n\ndifferent from § 666 bribery conspiracy cases. In a drug deal, once the sale is\n\ncomplete, there is no further criminal objective. In § 666 cases, once the gift is\n\nmade, the defendant typically intends to corruptly influence the County employee’s\n\n\n\n                                          80\n\ffuture actions.

In the summer of 2000, after Swann told PUGH’s Yessick\n\nhe had overspent in remodeling his house, Yessick hired Guthrie Landscaping to\n\nlandscape Swann’s two properties. By December 2001, PUGH had paid Guthrie\n\nmore than $93,000, including $1,200 per month in 2001 for lawn maintenance. In\n\nJanuary 2002, Yessick asked Guthrie to stop submitting invoices to PUGH and\n\ninstead advanced Guthrie $47,000 for three years of landscaping and maintenance.\n\nPUGH paid a total of approximately $140,000 to Guthrie for landscaping work for\n\nthe Swanns.64\n\n       Although Swann contends there was “no bribe” and none of this was “done\n\nin secrecy,” the evidence shows PUGH and Swann took steps to conceal any\n\nrecord of the services provided to Swann. Guthrie mailed its invoices to PUGH\n\nand, at Yessick’s request, identified the work by job number only. Yessick\n\ndirected PUGH’s controller to charge the expense to the Metro Park Roadway, a\n\nCounty job. Guthrie’s invoices were never found in PUGH’s files.\n\n       After Swann and Yessick learned of the investigation, Guthrie was abruptly\n\nasked to stop working at Swann’s home, even though there was a balance\n\n\n\n       64\n        In addition to the substantive bribery counts against Swann (Count 52) and PUGH\n(Count 61) for these landscaping services, both defendants were convicted of separate counts\n(Counts 90-100) of honest services mail fraud for payments PUGH made by mail to Guthrie.\n\n                                               83\n\fremaining on its $47,000 advance. In August and September 2002, approximately\n\ntwo years after hiring Guthrie, Yessick directed his assistant to create invoices to\n\nSwann’s mother and mother-in-law for landscaping, tree removal, and “remodeling\n\nwork.” The Swanns then took out home equity loans in the names of their\n\nmothers, and wrote two checks to PUGH totaling approximately $59,000 on joint\n\naccounts they held with their mothers. Yessick gave these checks directly to\n\nPUGH’s controller, telling her they were partial payment for $105,000 in\n\nlandscaping work PUGH had done, which work he had previously directed her to\n\nrecord as “miscellaneous AR.” Yessick told the controller to credit the $59,000 in\n\nchecks to PUGH as “miscellaneous income” and “to write off” the approximately\n\n$46,000 that remained.\n\n      Swann contends that PUGH merely located the landscaping contractor and\n\nthat he always intended to reimburse PUGH for payments to Guthrie. However,\n\nPUGH and Swann concealed the landscaping arrangement. The concealment itself\n\nis strong evidence that Swann accepted these services not as a loan, but as a bribe.\n\nSee United States v.

The court defined “intent to defraud” as “to\nact knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive someone.” Because a finding of specific\nintent to defraud necessarily excludes a finding of good faith, Swann’s requested instruction was\n“substantially covered by other instructions that were delivered,” and Swann has shown no error\nin the refusal to give his requested good faith charge.

Before take-off, Roland Pugh told Grady\n\nPugh that “McNair has called now and says that he’s broke and he doesn’t have\n\nenough money to leave for the deposit on the carpet. So, if you would, write a\n\ncheck for the deposit.” Grady Pugh paid the deposit with a $4,820 PUGH check\n\nand had it treated on the company’s books as an expense on the “last rehab\n\ncontract.”66\n\n      Roland Pugh also gave McNair money in connection with the project to\n\ndevelop McNair’s studio. When the project began, Roland Pugh told PUGH’s\n\nother three owners, Grady Pugh, Andy Pugh, and Yessick, that they had to give\n\nmoney to McNair because he was building a studio and, as ten percent owners,\n\nthey had to “kick in” their ten percent. Grady Pugh gave approximately $1,500 in\n\n\n\n\n      66\n           Grady Pugh’s testimony in this regard was corroborated by Bill Bailey’s testimony.\n\n                                                 86\n\fcash to Roland Pugh’s secretary that time to give to McNair.67\n\n       On another occasion, Roland Pugh collected money from the three other\n\nPUGH owners to give to McNair for his studio. On July 18 and 19, 2000, three of\n\nthem wrote checks to cash in proportion to their ownership interests. (Roland\n\nPugh: $7,000, Andy Pugh: $1,000, Yessick: $1,000). Roland Pugh gave Grady\n\nPugh an envelope of money and asked him to give it to McNair. Grady Pugh took\n\nit to McNair’s studio where he saw FWDE’s Bailey and told Bailey he (Grady\n\nPugh) was there to help McNair, and that it was “financial help” that McNair\n\nneeded at that time. Grady Pugh then visited with McNair for a few minutes and\n\nset the envelope down between the seats of the van they were in as McNair\n\nwatched. After McNair retired, Roland Pugh complained to Grady Pugh about\n\nMcNair’s demand for help building a retirement home, saying that “surely this is\n\nthe last time we’ll have to do anything for him since he’s out of office.”68\n\n\n       67\n          We reject Roland Pugh’s claim that his conspiracy conviction falls outside of the statute\nof limitations because no member of the “Pugh spoke” committed an overt act after August 26,\n2000. The Rast and Dougherty defendants took actions in furtherance of the conspiracy well\nwithin the statute of limitations. “[A]n individual conspirator need not participate in the overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy. Once a conspiracy is established, and an individual is\nlinked to that conspiracy, an overt act committed by any conspirator is sufficient.” United States\nv. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656644\"><a href=\"/opinion/656644/united-states-v-david-milton-thomas-lisa-reese-william-bide-shelton-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1560 n.21 (11th Cir. 1993). Because Roland Pugh had joined the\nconspiracy to bribe McNair and because that conspiracy continued into the statute of limitations\nperiod, Roland Pugh’s conviction stands even if he took no actions within that period. The\ndistrict court properly instructed the jury that it could convict Roland Pugh if any co-conspirator\ncommitted an act after August 26, 2000.\n       68\n         Roland Pugh cites the drug case of United States v. Mercer, 165 F.3d at 1335-36, for\nthe proposition that there is no conspiracy where there is merely a “buy-sell transaction.” As\n\n                                                87\n\f       Later, after McNair asked Roland Pugh to pay for the studio’s $40,000 air\n\nconditioning system, Roland Pugh gathered funds by writing checks to his\n\ndaughters-in-law and to cash. Once again, Grady Pugh delivered an envelope of\n\ncash to McNair, this time at his house.\n\n       As a result, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict Roland Pugh\n\nand to find that he was aware of at least some of the other co-conspirators, such as\n\nFWDE and FWDE’s Bailey, given that they were working on separate parts of a\n\nlarger project. Accordingly, we reject Roland Pugh’s sufficiency of the evidence\n\nchallenge to his conviction on Count 1.\n\n       The cases Roland Pugh relies on are inapposite. In United States v.\n\nChandler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807-08 (11th Cir. 2004), the “hub” of the conspiracy\n\nensured “there was no connection whatsoever between the various spokes,” and the\n\nspokes “knew nothing about each other.” The evidence here shows that Roland\n\nPugh was aware not only of PUGH, Yessick, and Grady Pugh’s involvement in the\n\nMcNair project, but also that of the Dougherty and Rast defendants’ involvement.\n\nFor the same reason, United States v. Glinton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757713\"><a href=\"/opinion/757713/united-states-v-ronald-glinton-morris-mcfadden-timothy-hatten-lavon/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1998), is\n\nnot on point. Id. at 1251 n.5 (concluding “hub and spoke” conspiracy must have\n\n\nexplained earlier, Mercer is materially different from § 666 bribery conspiracy cases. In any\nevent, Roland Pugh’s argument lacks merit as to Count 1 because there is ample evidence that\npersons other than Roland Pugh and McNair were involved in the transactions in the bribery\nconspiracy.\n\n                                               88\n\f“some interaction between those conspirators who form the spokes of the wheel as\n\nto at least one common illegal object”) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nE.     McNair’s Arguments Regarding Dawson\n\n       The evidence at the McNair trial showed McNair’s conviction for accepting\n\na bribe from Dawson is adequately supported. Dawson’s firm received millions of\n\ndollars in no-bid engineering contracts from McNair, and the vast majority of\n\nDawson’s work was on JCESD contracts. McNair solicited the studio’s $16,400\n\naudio-video system from Dawson. Dawson “was uncomfortable with the whole\n\nsituation” and would not have agreed if McNair was not part of the sewer\n\nrehabilitation process, so he had the store conceal the delivery address on the\n\ninvoice.\n\n                                  VIII. 404(B) EVIDENCE\n\n       All defendant-appellants challenge the admission of other bad acts evidence\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).69 Specifically, they contend the district\n\ncourts erred by admitting, for example, Swann-bribe evidence in the McNair trial\n\nand McNair-bribe evidence in the Swann trial.\n\n\n\n\n       69\n          A district court’s evidentiary rulings under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) are\nreviewed only for “a clear abuse of discretion.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1208. “[T]his\nCourt ‘will not hold that the district court abused its discretion where it reached the correct result\neven if it did so for the wrong reason.’” Id.

Rule 404(b) does not exclude evidence that is “linked in time and\n\n\n\n                                           90\n\fcircumstances with the charged crime” or that “forms an integral and natural part\n\nof an account of the crime to complete the story of the crime for the jury.” Wright,\n\n392 F.3d at 1276 (quotations omitted); United States v.

First,\n\nthe evidence was inextricably intertwined with evidence of the charged bribery\n\noffenses. Second, even if not inextricably intertwined, this evidence was relevant\n\nto show corrupt intent and admissible under 404(b). Defendant-appellants\n\nexpressly argued they lacked corrupt intent and gave gifts to McNair and Swann\n\nout of friendship and good will.70 Evidence that the contractor-defendants gave\n\nthings of value to Swann in McNair’s trial and to McNair in Swann’s trial was\n\nhighly probative of the contractor-defendants’ intent. See Edouard, 485 F.3d at\n\n1345 (concluding extrinsic evidence is relevant “where the state of mind required\n\nfor the charged and extrinsic offenses is the same”). Moreover, evidence of similar\n\nconduct that occurs during the same time period has “heightened” probative value.\n\nJones, 913 F.2d at 1566. Indeed, the district court judge, in the McNair trial,\n\nexplained in a pre-trial order:\n\n\n\n       70\n         Roland Pugh does not stress lack of corrupt intent because he claims he was not\ninvolved at all in any gift. Other than Roland Pugh, defendants do not argue things of value\nwere not given by them to County officials, but they claim they were gifts, not bribes.\n\n                                               91\n\f       While the jury might conceivably find that the defendant felt such a\n       strong sense of friendship with McNair that they would give him\n       substantial gifts or make him substantial loans, the fact that they gave\n       alleged “gifts” or made “loans” to others involved with the same or\n       similar projects would certainly be relevant to the issues of “motive” and\n       “intent.” It could also bear on “plan” . . . [and i]f the projects are the\n       same or similar, they may well be a part of the same “series of\n       transactions.” . . . [W]hat might arguably be a “gift” to one person\n       becomes less likely a gift if the “gifts” are widespread to others involved\n       with the same or similar projects.[71]\n\nSimilarly in the Swann trial, another district court judge found that this sort of\n\nevidence of intent is “exactly what 404(b) testimony is here for.”\n\n       Third, the evidence was admissible under 404(b) to show the contractor-\n\ndefendants’ common plan and motive. Specifically, the evidence showed a\n\ncommon plan of bribing County officials controlling the sewer projects by\n\nproviding them with work on their personal homes or businesses and working\n\ntogether to do so during the same time frame of the sewer projects. For example,\n\nin the McNair trial, evidence showed — just as FWDE’s Bailey was supervising,\n\nand RAST and PUGH were providing labor and materials for the McNair studio\n\nexpansion — FWDE’s Stanger was supervising and using a RAST credit card to\n\npurchase materials for Swann’s separate home renovation. Similarly, in the Swann\n\ntrial, the evidence showed that RAST sent Luke Cobb to pour a concrete\n\n\n       71\n        The McNair judge stated in a subsequent order, “[t]he offenses were similar and\ntemporally close. The 404(b) evidence was clearly appropriate to meet the government’s\nrequirement to prove intent.”\n\n                                              92\n\ffoundation for McNair’s studio, just as he had done for the expansion of Swann’s\n\nhome, and that PUGH had provided Chandler with landscaping, just as it did for\n\nSwann. Indeed, the evidence recounted at length above gives repeated examples of\n\nhow the 404(b) evidence was relevant to show both corrupt intent and a common\n\nplan and motive.\n\n      Furthermore, the district courts in both the McNair and Swann trials gave\n\nlimiting instructions for the 404(b) evidence several times during the trials. See\n\nUnited States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596605\"><a href=\"/opinion/596605/united-states-v-jorge-humberto-diaz-lizaraza/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1225 (11th Cir. 1993) (concluding\n\nprejudice could be mitigated by giving a cautionary instruction on the limited use\n\nof such evidence). In the McNair trial, for example, after testimony of\n\nDougherty’s contributions to Swann’s remodeling, the court instructed in part:\n\n      This evidence is being allowed for the limited purpose, with respect to\n      Mr. Dougherty, as to what Mr. Dougherty’s intent may have been at the\n      time that he may have made payments, or contributions, or gifts, to Mr.\n      McNair. Not that Mr. McNair is charged with receiving anything in\n      connection with Mr. Swann’s house.\n\n      But the evidence is allowed for the purpose of your considering that if\n      Mr. Dougherty was making some sort of payments, or contributions, or\n      gifts, on behalf of Mr. McNair; and if he was also making some sort of\n      gifts, or payments, or contributions on behalf of Mr. Swann, you can\n      consider that combination with regard to your determination, which will\n      be a necessary determination for you to make, as to what Mr. Dougherty\n      and his company’s intent was, and the nature of that intent, whether it be\n      corrupt or otherwise, at the time he made gifts, or contributions, or\n      payments, on behalf of Mr. McNair.\n\n\n\n                                          93\n\fIn the Swann trial, the court gave similar limiting instructions several times.72\n\n       And the jury acquitted some defendants on some counts while convicting\n\nthem on others.

In the McNair trial, the jury convicted and acquitted different defendants on the\nsame charges. In McNair, the jury convicted McNair on Counts 1-3 and 5-12 but acquitted him\non Count 4. In both the McNair and Swann trials, the jury convicted Bobby Rast but acquitted\nDanny Rast on some of the same counts. In the Barber trial, the jury convicted PUGH but\n\n                                                94\n\f       Defendant-appellants’ claim that the 404(b) evidence should have been\n\nexcluded under Rule 403 lacks merit too. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 403,\n\nevidence must be excluded if its probative value “is substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice.” Wright, 392 F.3d at 1276. “Rule 403 is an\n\nextraordinary remedy that must be used sparingly because it results in the\n\nexclusion of concededly probative evidence.” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at\n\n1211. This Court in US Infrastructure rejected defendant USI’s argument that\n\ncertain 404(b) evidence of a non-party’s bribes of McNair was inadmissible on\n\nRule 403 undue prejudice grounds, stating “in cases where this Court has found\n\nother acts evidence inextricably intertwined with the crimes charged, the Court has\n\nrefused to find that the evidence should nonetheless be excluded as unduly\n\nprejudicial . . . .” Id. “[T]he test under Rule 403 is whether the other acts evidence\n\nwas ‘dragged in by the heels’ solely for prejudicial impact.” Id.

Because the other acts\n\nevidence was inextricably intertwined with the charged crimes, it was not\n\nexcludable under Rule 403. In any event, its probative value substantially\n\n\nacquitted Roland Pugh on the same counts.\n        Moreover, in the Swann and Wilson trials, the district court charged the jury to consider\neach defendant “separately and individually” and reminded them that “each defendant is on trial\nonly for the specific offenses or offense charged against such defendant in the indictment.” In\nthe McNair and Barber trials, the district court gave the same instruction with slight variations.\nSuch jury instructions substantially mitigate the risk of spillover prejudice.

The bribery of other County employees shown in the McNair\n\nand Swann trials was an integral part of the overall bribery scheme because it\n\nshowed a common plan and motive of the contractor-defendants and completed the\n\nstory. The government amply showed linkage between contractor-defendants’\n\nbribes to McNair and those to Swann and other County employees and vice versa.\n\nWhile the USI trial considered in US Infrastructure involved 404(b) testimonial\n\n\n\n                                         96\n\fevidence by electrical contractor Henson, which is not at issue in this appeal, this\n\nCourt’s analysis in US Infrastructure is apt here: “Henson’s testimony was\n\nrelevant to the chain of events surrounding the charged crimes, including context\n\nand setup . . . .” US Infrastructure, 576 F.3d at 1211.74\n\n       Finally, defendant-appellants point out that the two trials were severed and\n\nthat “[s]everance under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is\n\nwarranted only when a defendant demonstrates that a joint trial will result in\n\n‘specific and compelling prejudice’ to his defense.” Defendant-appellants argue\n\nthat, because the district court severed the case, it “must have found that the jury\n\nwould be unable to consider the evidence separately as it pertained to individual\n\ndefendants.”\n\n       This argument is unavailing. The district judge who severed these cases\n\nstated in a later telephone conference that, “perhaps some of [these cases] didn’t\n\neven call for severance, but I leaned toward trying to avoid as much confusion as I\n\n\n\n       74\n          The district court also did not err in admitting evidence of cash deposits to McNair’s\nstudio’s construction account. See United States v. Lattimore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540926\"><a href=\"/opinion/540926/united-states-v-shirley-lorraine-lattimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 903 (11th Cir.\n1990) (stating “[w]here the charged crime involves pecuniary gain and the Government presents\nother evidence of the defendant’s guilt, evidence of the sudden acquisition of money by the\ndefendant or his or her spouse is admissible, even if the Government does not trace the source of\nthis new wealth.”). This evidence was highly relevant to McNair’s intent to accept goods and\nservices bribes, especially since these cash deposits were to the McNair studio account and the\ngoods and services bribes involved the same McNair studio. The cash deposits also were listed\nas overt acts in Count 50. The defendants also have not shown reversible error as to their claim\nof untimely notice under 404(b).\n\n                                               97\n\fcould.” In the same teleconference, the district court ruled that 404(b) evidence of\n\nother bribes was relevant and that jury instructions would prevent improper use of\n\nthat evidence. (“I’m going to assume that if I tell them three or four times, they’ll\n\nunderstand it.”) At the beginning of the McNair trial, the court stated the cases\n\nwere severed because it would be “cumbersome to try” them together, but “[t]hat\n\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that evidentiarily, they’re not related.” During the\n\nMcNair trial, the district court again rejected defendant-appellants’ argument that\n\nseverance of the counts meant that evidence related to the severed counts was\n\nirrelevant, stating:\n\n       But that doesn’t have anything to do with whether or not something is or\n       is not relevant evidence to some other situation. That’s like saying, they\n       indicted them for a bank robbery thing but you can’t show that they\n       spent some of the cash over here in another deal or something.\n\nDefendant-appellants cite no legal support for their argument that severance per se\n\nmeans other bribe evidence cannot be admitted. That the district court gave the\n\ndefendants the benefit of trying McNair and the contractor-defendants in one trial,\n\nand then Swann and the contractor-defendants in a separate trial, does not mean all\n\nevidence about bribes to Swann could not be introduced in the McNair trial and\n\nvice versa.\n\n         IX. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN MCNAIR TRIAL\n\n       As to their convictions in the McNair trial, defendants PUGH and Roland\n\n                                           98\n\fPugh argue that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by (1) failing to correct\n\nGrady Pugh’s false testimony, and (2) eliciting additional false testimony from\n\nGrady Pugh, thereby violating their due process rights.75 Specifically, these\n\ndefendants argue that at trial Grady Pugh falsely denied having previously said he\n\ndelivered cash bribes to McNair before a May 24, 2000 trip to buy carpet and\n\nfalsely testified that he delivered the money after that May 24, 2000 trip.\n\n       These cash bribes were part of Counts 13 and 14. During the McNair trial,\n\nthe time line of these events was at issue because it determined whether Counts 13\n\nand 14 were barred by the statute of limitations.76 The jury acquitted PUGH and\n\nRoland Pugh on Counts 13 and 14.77 While the acquittal moots the statute of\n\nlimitations issue, the time line of the cash bribes remains relevant only as to Count\n\n1 (bribery conspiracy) and only because those cash bribes were alleged as overt\n\n\n       75\n        PUGH’s brief specifically adopts Roland Pugh’s prosecutorial misconduct arguments,\nand Roland Pugh adopts all relevant portions of PUGH’s brief as to all issues. McNair, RAST,\nBobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty adopt all arguments of all defendants as to all\nissues.\n       76\n         The parties referenced the five-year limitations period for Counts 13 and 14 as from\nAugust 26, 2000 to August 26, 2005, the date the Second Supseding Indictment was submitted,\nwhich added Roland Pugh as a defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 3282. Count 13 charged PUGH and\nYessick with giving McNair $20,000 in cash. Count 14 charged PUGH and Roland Pugh with\ngiving McNair at least $10,000 in cash in January 2001. However, if the cash bribes occurred\nbefore the May 24, 2000 carpet purchase in Georgia, the defendants argued Counts 13 and 14\nwould be barred by the five-year statute of limitations.\n       77\n         While PUGH was convicted on multiple counts, Roland Pugh was convicted on only\nCount 1, the bribery conspiracy count. Other than some documentary evidence, Grady Pugh was\nthe only witness testifying against Roland Pugh as to Count 1.\n\n                                              99\n\facts in furtherance of the overall conspiracy to bribe McNair, for which PUGH and\n\nRoland Pugh were convicted. On appeal PUGH and Roland Pugh argue Grady\n\nPugh’s false testimony about the time line goes to his credibility and that if the jury\n\nknew he was lying, this could have affected the guilty verdict on Count 1.78\n\n       To establish prosecutorial misconduct for the use of false testimony, a\n\ndefendant must show the prosecutor knowingly used perjured testimony, or failed\n\nto correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony, and that the falsehood\n\nwas material.79 See United States v.

Grady Pugh’s Testimony About Cash Deliveries\n\n      The false testimony claim stems from notes the prosecutor made during\n\nGrady Pugh’s two meetings with the prosecutor for plea negotiations on June 17\n\nand 21, 2005. An FBI agent, counsel for Grady Pugh, and separate corporate\n\ncounsel for PUGH were also present. The prosecutor’s 2005 notes refer to Grady\n\nPugh’s two cash deliveries to McNair and his trip to Georgia where Grady\n\npurchased carpet for McNair on May 24, 2000 (for which Grady signed a PUGH\n\ncompany check bearing that date). The government disclosed the prosecutor’s\n\nnotes to defense counsel several months before trial.\n\n      At the McNair trial, Grady Pugh testified he delivered two envelopes of cash\n\nto McNair — the first at McNair’s studio and the second at McNair’s home at\n\nChristmas 2000 — both after he (Grady Pugh) took a flight to Georgia to purchase\n\nthe carpet on May 24, 2000. In response, PUGH’s counsel sought to impeach\n\nGrady Pugh using the prosecutor’s 2005 notes, attempting to show the notes\n\n\n\n                                          102\n\freflected Grady Pugh gave both cash envelopes to McNair before Grady Pugh\n\npurchased the carpet on May 24, 2000. PUGH’s counsel showed Grady Pugh the\n\nnotes of the June 17, 2005 meeting indicating Grady delivered two cash envelopes\n\nto McNair:\n\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     It says in here that I delivered money to the studio\n                        and to his house, in these notes. . . .\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: Does it not say, the next time that Roland [Pugh]\n                        asked Grady [Pugh] to deliver an envelope of\n                        money, it was to McNair, was at McNair’s studio?\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     It says that, yes, sir.\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: Okay. Despite that, that does not refresh your\n                        recollection?\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     Despite what it says, it’s not true.80\n\nPUGH’s counsel then showed Grady Pugh the prosecutor’s notes from the June 21,\n\n2005 meeting and asked if he recalled that he told the prosecutor the two cash\n\n\n      80\n        The June 17, 2005 meeting notes state:\n      –Roland Pugh asked Grady to deliver the money to McNair\n      –One Roland money [sic]\n      –Grady recalls being at Northport and having to take the envelope, which was a half inch\n      thick, to McNair’s house\n      –Grady and McNair sat down together in the house and chatted and then Grady left the\n      envelope there between the two of them where McNair saw him put it\n      –The next time that Roland asked Grady to deliver an envelope of money it was to\n      McNair was at McNair Studio\n      –McNair was late and Grady had to wait for him\n      –When McNair showed up, Grady and McNair went to the van where they chatted and\n      then Grady left the envelope there where McNair saw him put it down\n      –This delivery of money was after the shell of the studio had been erected\n      –Roland Pugh called Grady and told him that “McNair needs to look at some carpet” (or\n      words to that effect) and that McNair needed RPC [PUGH] to make the deposit on the\n      carpet\n      –Grady got the company plane to Birmingham and took McNair’s daughter and Bill\n      Bailey to LaGrange, Georgia to pick out the carpet\n\n                                             103\n\fdeliveries were before the carpet trip, but Grady replied he did not recall saying it\n\nin that order as follows:\n\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: I want to direct you to the portion of [the\n                        prosecutor’s] notes which read, Grady [Pugh]\n                        delivered the second envelope of cash to McNair at\n                        the studio.\n                        ....\n      [PUGH’S COUNSEL]: And after that, I want to direct your attention to the\n                        portion of [the prosecutor’s] notes that say, Bill\n                        Bailey was there. And it continues, quote “best I\n                        recall” close quote, this was the first time Grady\n                        [Pugh] met Bill Bailey; and then it continues.\n                        Months later, Grady [Pugh] flew to Georgia for the\n                        carpet. . . . Does this refresh your memory that when\n                        you met with [the prosecutor and an FBI agent], that\n                        the sequence you provided was that the first delivery\n                        was to the house, the second delivery was to the\n                        studio, and they were both done months before you\n                        flew to Georgia for the carpet?\n      [GRADY PUGH]:     I don’t recall saying it in that order. The order that\n                        I remember it in, is the order that I told you Friday.\n                        I went to the studio first, then I went to the carpet,\n                        and then I went to Mr. McNair’s house; and that’s\n                        the way I remember it. That’s the way it\n                        happened.[81]\n\n\n      81\n       The June 21, 2005 meeting notes state:\n      –Grady thinks the RPC [PUGH] office was still in Northport when he delivered the first\n      envelope to McNair\n      –Grady had to drive from Northport\n      –Grady thinks the second McNair envelope was when RPC’s office was in the trailers in\n      Avondale\n      ....\n      –Grady delivered the second envelope of cash to McNair at the studio\n      –He and McNair had already spoken inside the studio and then went to McNair’s van\n      –Bill Bailey was there when Grady delivered the cash to McNair Studio but Grady does\n      not appear to recall talking to Bailey about the money he was giving to McNair\n\n                                            104\n\f      PUGH’s counsel suggested to the district court that he might call the\n\nprosecutor as a witness. The Court responded: “I think whatever you’d be calling\n\nhim for doesn’t amount to a hill of beans, and I’m not going to let it be done just to\n\ncause friction or embarrassment or whatever. So my strong inclination will be not\n\nto allow it.” The defense did not call the prosecutor to testify.\n\n      In closing argument, PUGH’s counsel argued Grady Pugh lied about the\n\ntime line of these events, that his cash deliveries occurred outside the statute of\n\nlimitations, and that the prosecutor’s notes supported this argument. PUGH’s\n\ncounsel also recited portions of the prosecutor’s notes.82\n\n\n      –‘Best I recall’ this was the first time Grady met Bill Bailey\n      –The weather was sunny but not cold\n      –Months later, Grady flew to Georgia for the carpet\n      82\n        In closing argument, PUGH’s counsel stated:\n      And then you heard on Monday, I finally got to show in Mr. Dillon’s notes of that\n      very interview. And he read to you from Mr. Dillon’s own notes of the June 17th\n      meetings. And he read to you, where they were talking chronologically in the June\n      17th, the first meeting, where he said that he delivered a note, an envelope to Mr.\n      McNair’s house, and the next time he was asked to deliver the envelope to the studio,\n      and that then he was talking chronologically about going to look for carpet. And it\n      was even clearer when he got into the notes of the second interview where he said\n      he delivered the second envelope of cash to McNair at the studio, the best he could\n      recall. Remember I even got him -- I think it was in quotes. Best I recall, this was\n      the first time Grady met Bill Bailey. The next line, months later, Grady flew to\n      Georgia for the carpet. Those are from Mr. Dillon’s own notes of that meeting and\n      that’s what you heard the testimony was. Those do not establish any payment in\n      July, whatsoever. They don’t establish any payment that’s been alleged in this case\n      whatsoever. . . .\n      He gave even another story while on the stand. I was asking about the sequence and\n      I was asking him whether these notes from his meeting refreshed his memory and he\n      said I don’t recall saying it in that order. The order that I remember it in is the order\n      that I told you Friday. I went to the studio first, then I went to the carpet, and then\n\n                                                105\n\f       We conclude defendants PUGH and Roland Pugh have not met their burden\n\nto show Grady Pugh’s testimony was actually false, much less that the government\n\nknew it was false. First, the notes themselves are in bullet form and contain no\n\ndates nor any explicit indication that they were necessarily intended to be read in\n\nchronological order. At trial Grady Pugh agreed he had a “clear recollection” of\n\nwhat he said during the meetings. At trial Grady Pugh reviewed the notes on\n\ndefense counsel’s instruction and stated that the notes were “not laid out in the\n\norder that things happened,” that he did not “recall saying it in that order,” and,\n\n“[d]espite what it says, it’s not true.”83\n\n       Importantly, the documentary evidence is consistent with Grady Pugh’s trial\n\ntestimony that he delivered the money after the carpet purchase. The government\n\nintroduced these checks: on May 24, 2000, Grady Pugh signed a $4,820.81 PUGH\n\ncheck made out to the carpet store; on July 18-19, 2000, Grady Pugh, Roland\n\nPugh, and Yessick signed checks to cash totaling $9,000; and from December 15 to\n\n22, 2000, Roland Pugh signed $38,750 in checks to Roland Pugh’s\n\ndaughters-in-law and to cash. Further, other witnesses corroborated Grady Pugh’s\n\n\n\n       I went to Mr. McNair’s house, that’s the way I remember it; and that’s the way it\n       happened.\n\n       83\n         Nothing in the record indicates that after the 2005 meetings, Grady Pugh checked or\nadopted the prosecutor’s notes.\n\n                                              106\n\ftrial testimony. For example, Bill Bailey testified he flew with Grady to pick out\n\ncarpet and saw him “again” at the studio, where they “talked about airplanes for a\n\nsecond” before Bailey asked Grady “if he was here to help Chris McNair again,” to\n\nwhich Grady answered yes.\n\n      Even assuming that Grady Pugh’s denials of prior inconsistency were false\n\nor his time line of events was false, defendants, at a minimum, have not shown the\n\nprosecutor knew Grady Pugh’s testimony was false, especially given how the\n\ndocuments and other witnesses corroborated his testimony.\n\n      In any event, defendants have shown no reversible error. The jury heard the\n\nrelevant portions of the notes read into the record when PUGH’s counsel was\n\ncross-examining Grady Pugh. During closing arguments, PUGH’s counsel argued\n\nthat the prosecutor’s notes contradicted Grady Pugh’s trial testimony and again\n\nrecited relevant portions of the notes. Defense counsel thoroughly and\n\nexhaustively cross-examined Grady Pugh. Defense counsel pointed out other\n\ninconsistencies within Grady Pugh’s trial testimony and in his grand jury\n\ntestimony. The jury was also well aware Grady Pugh had made a plea deal and\n\nthat the government’s assessment of his cooperation would impact his eventual\n\nsentence. The jury had the information it needed to make an informed decision as\n\nto Grady Pugh’s credibility. See United States v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747578\"><a href=\"/opinion/747578/united-states-v-alberto-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1325\n\n\n\n                                         107\n\f(11th Cir. 1997) (“[C]redibility determinations are the exclusive province of the\n\njury.”) (quotation marks omitted). “Therefore, because we find that the\n\nuncorrected, allegedly perjurious statements do not ‘undermine confidence in the\n\nverdict,’” we reject defendants’ prosecutorial misconduct claims. Dickerson, 248\n\nF.3d at 1042 (citations omitted).84\n\nB.     Grady Pugh’s Testimony About Note-Taking\n\n       Defendants PUGH and Roland Pugh also claim the prosecutor intentionally\n\nelicited from Grady Pugh the false testimony that “everyone was taking notes” at\n\nthe 2005 meetings, even though the prosecutor knew he had instructed the FBI\n\nagent not to take notes.85\n\n       At trial the prosecutor asked Grady Pugh about the note-taking:\n\n       Q:      And when you signed that plea agreement, Mr. Pugh, had you\n               already met with us on two occasions at the FBI office?\n       A:      Yes, sir.\n       Q:      And when you met with the FBI and myself, was your lawyer\n               there?\n       A:      Yes, sir.\n       Q:      And was the company lawyer there?\n       A:      Yes, sir.\n\n\n       84\n         We note the defense did not call others present at the 2005 meetings as to what Grady\nPugh said. And regardless of whether others at the 2005 meetings were taking notes, defense\ncounsel still could have called them to elicit their personal recollection of what Grady Pugh said.\nHowever, we need not rely on this fact as it is abundantly clear counsel effectively cross-\nexamined Grady Pugh.\n       85\n        The prosecutor acknowledged he told the FBI agent not to take notes during the 2005\nmeetings.\n\n                                                108\n\f       Q:     And was everybody taking notes?\n       A:     Yes, sir.\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense attempted to clarify this assertion, but Grady\n\nPugh stated that it “looked to me like everybody was taking notes.” PUGH’s\n\ncorporate counsel asked Grady Pugh, “[a]nd do you remember that I objected and I\n\nindicated that I would take notes?”\n\n       The foregoing colloquy is ambiguous as to whether the prosecutor was\n\nreferring to the lawyers in the room or also to the FBI agent. Grady Pugh\n\nreasonably could have taken “everybody” to mean the two lawyers about whom the\n\ndefense had just asked. Moreover, while the record shows the FBI agent was not\n\ntaking notes, defendants submitted no evidence that Grady Pugh’s counsel or\n\nPUGH’s counsel were not taking notes.86 In sum, the defense has not met its\n\nburden to show the prosecutor believed or knew Grady Pugh’s note-taking\n\ntestimony was false. In any event, the defendants have not shown a reasonable\n\nlikelihood that correction on this particular point, even if it did constitute “false\n\ntestimony,” could have changed the jury’s evaluation of Grady Pugh’s overall\n\n\n\n       86\n         The government stresses it would have been remarkable had Grady Pugh’s counsel not\ntaken notes during his own client’s debriefings and plea negotiations in these two meetings. The\nprosecutor also points out that there is a reference in a December 2005 hearing before the\nmagistrate judge that there was note-taking by Grady Pugh and PUGH’s counsel at these\nmeetings. We need not rely on that reference because it is enough to say defendants submitted\nno evidence that Grady Pugh or PUGH’s counsel were not taking notes and have not carried\ntheir burden to show Grady Pugh’s testimony was false.\n\n                                              109\n\fcredibility. Therefore, it does not undermine confidence in the verdict. See\n\nDickerson, 248 F.3d at 1041.\n\n              X. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN WILSON TRIAL\n\n       In the Wilson case, defendant PUGH claims the district court erred by\n\ndenying its motion to dismiss Count 75 as time-barred under the five-year statute\n\nof limitations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3282.87 Count 75 charged that from about August\n\n1999 and continuing though June 2000, defendants PUGH and Wilson (as the\n\nJCESD’s Chief Engineer) entered into a bribery conspiracy whereby Wilson\n\ncorruptly solicited and accepted, and PUGH corruptly gave, a $4,500 payment (in\n\nthe form of a bogus scholarship for Wilson’s son) with the intent of influencing\n\nand rewarding Wilson for supporting PUGH’s interests in connection with the\n\nJCESD sewer rehabilitation reconstruction program. Count 75 alleged that an\n\nobject of the conspiracy was for Wilson to enrich himself and that PUGH and\n\nWilson conspired to conceal PUGH’s payment to Wilson by having it disguised as\n\na bogus scholarship to UAB.\n\n       PUGH argues that Count 75 falls outside of the five-year limitations period\n\nbecause the latest overt act by a co-conspirator charged in the Indictment — Grady\n\n\n\n       87\n          “We review a district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for an abuse\nof discretion.” United States v.

The jury in the Wilson trial was\n\ncorrectly instructed on this point.\n\n      The problem for the government is the last two disbursements in 2000 were\n\nfrom a non-conspirator (UAB) to another non-conspirator (the son), and the\n\ngovernment presented no evidence that defendant PUGH (through Grady Pugh) or\n\nWilson knew that Wilson was receiving part of the benefit of the $4,500 in March\n\nor June 2000, rather than all at once in August 1999. There is also no evidence that\n\nGrady Pugh or Wilson gave any direction to UAB after August 24, 1999.

For starters, Congress has not\n\nexpressed any intent that § 666 crimes and § 371 crimes for conspiracy to violate\n\n§ 666 should merge. If Congress had intended to foreclose prosecuting § 371\n\nconspiracy offenses in § 666 crimes, it could have said so or merged the offenses.\n\nDefendants point to nothing in the legislative history that suggests any intent to\n\ndepart from the established general rule that a court can impose separate sentences\n\nfor conspiracy to commit bribery and the substantive offense itself.\n\n       Second, the effect of the crime of § 666 bribery is not limited to the\n\nbribe-payor and recipient, as the crime involves public corruption, which harms\n\nsociety as a whole. “The purpose of § 666, to protect the integrity of federal funds,\n\nindicates that the immediate consequences of the behavior it proscribes rest on\n\nsociety at large,” in this case, on the federal government and the people of\n\nJefferson County.

Accordingly,\n\nwe reject defendants’ claims based on Wharton’s Rule.91\n\n\n       91\n          The defendant-appellants raise these additional conviction-related issues. Swann argues\nthat (1) there was a material variance as to the conspiracy charged in the Indictment and any\nconspiracy proven, (2) the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on multiple\nconspiracies, (3) the district court erred in not giving his proposed good faith instruction, (4) the\ndistrict court should have severed his case alone for trial and apart from the contractor-\ndefendants who bribed him, and (5) the district court committed cumulative error.\n         Roland Pugh and PUGH argue that (1) the district court erred in not giving a proposed\ninstruction defining goodwill gifts and legal gratuities, (2) Count 15 as to PUGH should have\nbeen dismissed as “duplicitous,” (3) there was a material variance as to their convictions for\nbribery conspiracy, (4) their involvement at most consisted of one-time buyer-seller transactions\ninsufficient to sustain a conspiracy conviction, and (5) the district court committed cumulative\n\n                                                118\n\f                             XII. MCNAIR’S SENTENCE 92\n\n       McNair was sentenced to concurrent 60-month sentences on one bribery\n\nconspiracy count (Count 1) and ten substantive bribery counts (Counts 2-3, 5-12)\n\nfrom the McNair trial and one bribery conspiracy count from the USI case (Count\n\n32).93 The district court ordered McNair to pay restitution of $851,927 to the\n\nJefferson County Commission and a special assessment of $1,200 but no fine.\n\nThis restitution represented $376,927 in bribes to McNair by Dawson and the\n\nPugh, Rast, and Dougherty defendants, and $475,000 in bribes to McNair by the\n\nUSI contractors.94 On appeal, McNair challenges only the restitution part of his\n\nerror. As noted before, McNair, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty adopt\nall arguments of all defendants as to all issues. In his cumulative error claims, Swann adopts all\narguments of all defendants as to all issues.\n        After review and oral argument, we conclude there is no reversible error as to any of\nthese listed issues or as to any other conviction-related issues raised by any defendants.\n       92\n        Defendants McNair, Swann, and PUGH appeal their sentences. Defendants Roland\nPugh, RAST, Bobby Rast, Danny Rast, FWDE, and Dougherty do not appeal their sentences.\n       93\n          McNair pled guilty to Count 32 in the USI case. In his plea agreement, he waived the\nright to “challenge any sentence so imposed or the manner in which the sentence was\ndetermined.” Thus, McNair waived his right to challenge his sentence as to Count 32.

Accordingly, we consider McNair’s sentence on only Counts\n1, 2-3, 5-12 in the McNair case.

During trial or at sentencing, the government proved that some bribe amounts\nactually were higher. For example, the Indictment as to Swann alleged the amount paid to\nStanger was $24,176, but the ultimate amount proved was $28,839. The Indictment as to\nMcNair alleged the amount paid to Bailey was $27,434, but the ultimate amount proved was\n$74,220.\n       95\n         This Court reviews de novo “the legality of an order of restitution,” and reviews for an\nabuse of discretion the determination of the restitution “value” of lost or destroyed property.\nUnited States v.

McNair’s main unresolved\n\nobjections were his claims that the government failed to show: (1) that there was\n\nany victim owed restitution; and (2) that $889,962 was the amount of loss incurred\n\nby Jefferson County. In his written objections, however, McNair did not claim that\n\nhe lacked the financial ability to pay restitution at all or in the amount of\n\n$889,962.100\n\nB.     Sentencing Hearing\n\n       At sentencing, McNair again claimed the government failed to identify any\n\nvictim and failed to show any identifiable losses by Jefferson County or any\n\nconnection between the bribes and the County’s losses. McNair ultimately\n\n\n\n       100\n         McNair filed no objection to ¶¶ 154-157 of the PSI that set forth all of this financial\ninformation.\n\n                                                123\n\fconceded he had received $851,927 in things of value but only for purposes of the\n\nguidelines imprisonment calculations.101\n\n       McNair maintained that no restitution should be awarded, because the\n\ngovernment had not shown the County suffered a loss in that $851,927 amount or\n\nany amount for that matter. McNair’s counsel argued that under “Title 18, 3663,\n\nthe Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, that the Government is required to show\n\nlosses connected to victims, and that the amount of bribes paid to Mr. McNair does\n\nnot constitute losses to victims, and that there’s been no showing of that. . . .”\n\nMcNair contended “the amount of bribes paid to us is in no way connected to\n\nwhatever losses these victims may or may not have sustained.” McNair claimed\n\nthere was no showing that $851,927 was the loss to the County. Citing\n\n“3663(B)(ii)” twice, McNair also argued the district court should not order\n\nrestitution because the complexity and prolongation of the sentencing process in\n\nidentifying victims and determining the amount of losses attributed to those\n\nvictims outweighed the need to provide restitution. We pause to point out here that\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3663 is the Victim & Witness Protection Act (“VWPA”), not the\n\n\n       101\n          Contrary to the government’s arguments, McNair’s counsel repeatedly objected to the\nvictims’ identities and loss amounts for the basis of restitution. For example, McNair’s counsel\nstated: “We have agreed, for guidelines calculations, concerning that amount, but we do not\nbelieve that that is an appropriate figure or that there is any appropriate figure for restitution in\nthis case. And there is no basis legally to — for the Court to impose that kind of restitution order\nin this matter.”\n\n                                                124\n\fMandatory Victims Restitution Act (“MVRA”), and the substance of McNair’s\n\nargument comes from the VWPA.102 And as discussed later, the district court’s\n\njudgment effectively refers to the VWPA.\n\n       During the sentencing hearing, McNair again did not claim he lacked the\n\nfinancial ability to pay restitution at all or in the amount of $889,962 referenced in\n\nthe PSI. Ultimately, the district court found the Jefferson County Commission was\n\nthe identifiable victim and found the amount of loss suffered was $851,927,\n\nreasoning:\n\n       [C]ommon sense seems to me that, in any business, it doesn’t\n       intentionally go into business for the purpose of losing money; that the\n       evidence in all of these cases clearly shows that there was a great deal of\n       profit to be earned from these sewer contracts. And it seems to me,\n       commonsensically, that if you pay a certain amount of money as bribe\n       money, whether it’s cash or for services performed, you’re going to add\n       that back into the contracts or the bills submitted to the Jefferson County\n       Commission which pays the bills, in the first instance.\n\n       It is how they do business. Stated more clearly, it is a cost of business,\n       a direct cost of business that it paid and made up for, at some point, by\n       the Jefferson County Commission directly, and then indirectly to the rate\n       payers of Jefferson County.[103]\n\n\n       102\n          Section 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii) is part of the VWPA and provides:\n       (ii) To the extent that the court determines that the complication and prolongation of\n       the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution under\n       this section outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may\n       decline to make such an order.\n18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii). Although citing “3663(B)(ii),” McNair’s counsel argued the\nsubstance of § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n       103\n             Judge C. Linwood Smith sentenced McNair after Judge Robert B. Propst conducted the\n\n                                               125\n\fRecognizing the sewer construction contracts were awarded through a bidding\n\nprocess, the district court found that “the benefit to the bribe payors did not\n\nnecessarily accrue in the awarding of those contracts in the first instance, but,\n\nrather, the benefit accrued during the performance phase of the work that they were\n\nengaged to perform through change orders, through agreements to additional\n\npayments due to change orders, and things of that nature.” The district court also\n\nfound, “[a]t some point, any direct cost of business is going to be added back by\n\nthe bribe payors in the bills, the padded bills, that are submitted to the Jefferson\n\nCounty Commission,” and “therefore, the Jefferson County Commission, in the\n\nfirst instance, which paid those bids, is an identifiable victim.”\n\n       The district court reduced McNair’s total offense level by 10 levels from 36\n\nin the PSI to 26. Specifically, the district court reduced the 24-level enhancement\n\nin the PSI to a 14-level enhancement under §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) and 2B1.1(b)(1)(H).\n\nFor the § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) calculation, the district court used the $851,927 in bribes\n\nthe contractors made to McNair, not the $67,980,043 in net profits or benefits the\n\ncontractors received.104 After determining McNair’s offense level was 26 and\n\n\n\nMcNair trial.\n       104\n          The guidelines provide that for an offense where the benefit received or loss to the\ngovernment is more than $400,000 but not more than $1 million, a defendant’s offense level will\nincrease 14 levels. U.S.S.G. §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) (2001). Section 2C1.1 governs\nthe offense level for bribery of public officials but also uses, in part, the theft table in § 2B1.1.\n\n                                                 126\n\fcriminal history category was I, the district court determined that the advisory\n\nguidelines range was 63 to 70 months’ imprisonment.105\n\n       The district court sentenced McNair to 60 months’ imprisonment for each\n\ncount, to run concurrently, followed by two years’ supervised release, and ordered\n\nrestitution of $851,927 to the Jefferson County Commission and a special\n\nassessment of $1,200. Although the advisory guidelines fine range was $20,000 to\n\n$135,960,086, the district court did not impose any fine. After noting its review of\n\nthe PSI’s financial information, the district court stated it imposed restitution but\n\nno fine, as follows:\n\n       I reviewed the financial information provided in your presentence\n       investigation. And in reliance upon that information, I find that you do\n       not have the financial ability to pay even a minimum guideline fine.\n       Further, the imposition of such a fine would unduly burden your wife,\n       who is totally dependent upon you for not just physical and spiritual, but\n       financial support. Therefore, no fine will be imposed.\n\n       I do order, however, as I must order, that you pay to the United States a\n       special assessment in the aggregate amount of $1,200. You also are\n       ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $851,927. That is due to the\n       Jefferson County Commission at the address shown in paragraph 172 of\n       your presentence report.\n\n\n\n       105\n          McNair objected to the PSI’s failure to accord McNair a reduction for acceptance of\nresponsibility. The district court overruled that objection. McNair does not appeal the district\ncourt’s calculation of his advisory guidelines range as 63 to 70 months’ imprisonment.\n        In addition, the government has not challenged the district court’s use of the bribe\namounts, as opposed to the net profits amounts, as the basis for the enhancement calculation\nunder § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), nor McNair’s advisory guidelines range. So we assume for present\npurposes that the use of the bribe amounts and the guidelines range were proper.\n\n                                               127\n\fAt sentencing, the district court did not expressly state the statutory basis for its\n\norder of restitution. However, the district court’s judgment states that, “pursuant to\n\nthe Victim & Witness Restitution Act,” the court finds the Jefferson County\n\nCommission is a victim of McNair’s criminal conduct, has sustained a loss in the\n\namount of $851,927, and orders restitution in the amount of $851,927.106\n\nC.     Restitution for Victim’s Loss\n\n       The VWPA, 18 U.S.C. § 3663, provides that:\n\n       The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under\n       [Title 18] . . . other than an offense described in section 3663A(c),[ 107]\n       may order . . . that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such\n       offense, . . .\n\n       (B)(i) The court, in determining whether to order restitution under this\n       section, shall consider–\n              (I) the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of\n          the offense; and\n\n\n       106\n          We reject the government’s argument that the district court imposed restitution under\nthe MVRA. The PSI recommended the district court order restitution under “18 U.S.C.\n§ 3663A(a)(1),” which is the MVRA. Although referring to the MVRA, McNair’s attorney (in\nthe sentencing hearing) cited sections in the VWPA and made arguments premised on the\nsubstance of the VWPA (§ 3663). And the district court’s judgment references the “Victim &\nWitness Restitution Act.” Although this reference used “Restitution” instead of Victim &\nWitness Protection Act, it more closely resembles the VWPA than the MVRA. The government\nnever objected to that reference and never moved to correct it. Thus, we conclude the district\ncourt imposed restitution under the VWPA.\n       107\n           The VWPA, under which restitution is discretionary, excepts offenses in § 3663A(c),\nwhich is the MVRA, under which restitution is mandatory. We sua sponte note there is a\npotential issue of whether bribery is “an offense against property” covered by § 3663A(c) and\nwhether the MVRA applies to bribery crimes. 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c). Nothing herein should be\nread as implying the answer to that question. We review the VWPA only because that is the\nonly thing the district court referenced in McNair’s sentence.\n\n                                              128\n\f            (II) the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs\n         and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant’s dependents,\n         and such other factors as the court deems appropriate. . . .\n\n      (2) For the purposes of this section, the term “victim” means a person\n      directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an\n      offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an\n      offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of\n      criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant’s criminal\n      conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3663. “The government bears the burden of demonstrating the amount\n\nof the victim’s loss by a preponderance of the evidence.” United States v.

County’s Losses\n\n      McNair argues that the government failed to prove any losses suffered by\n\nthe County. We disagree. For starters, the evidence showed McNair received\n\n$851,927 in goods, services, labor, materials, and money as a result of the bribery\n\n                                         129\n\fscheme.

The PSI set forth McNair’s finances in detail, the\n\ndistrict court said it had reviewed that financial information, and McNair did not\n\ncontest the facts as to his finances. There is no dispute that McNair has equity of\n\n$379,455 in his studio building, which was built in part using the bribe money.\n\nThe studio value could reduce the restitution from $851,927 to $472,472.\n\n      In addition, McNair has a net cash flow of $1,741 per month, which is about\n\nthe size of his monthly Jefferson County retirement check of $1,794. That\n\nretirement check alone permits McNair to pay $21,528 annually toward the\n\nrestitution. Five years of $21,528 payments annually would equal over $100,000\n\nin restitution. The unique problem in this case, however, is that McNair is now 84\n\nyears old.111 Although the PSI states McNair “reports no current medical problems\n\nor prescription medications taken on a regular basis,” it would take McNair 21.94\n\nyears at $21,528 per year to pay the remaining $472,472 left in restitution.\n\nTherefore, the record does not necessarily show that McNair has the financial\n\nability to pay the full $851,927 in restitution.\n\n      Nonetheless, under the fourth prong of plain error review, we conclude any\n\nerror does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings because (1) McNair, not the government, has the burden to prove lack\n\n\n\n      111\n            The PSI states McNair’s date of birth is November 22, 1925.\n\n                                                133\n\fof financial ability to pay the restitution in full; (2) the district court did not impose\n\nany fine but only restitution; (3) McNair does not dispute that he received\n\n$851,927 in goods, services, materials, labor, and other things of value; (4) no one,\n\nnot even the district court if we remanded for further findings, knows how long\n\nMcNair will live and continue to receive his monthly Jefferson County pension and\n\nthus be able to pay some restitution each month; and (5) the party owed this\n\nrestitution is the same party currently paying McNair $1,749 per month, making it\n\neminently fair to recapture these payments as restitution for as long as they are\n\nmade.

We review this claim for plain error. See United States v.

Presentence Report\n\n       The PSI: (1) assigned Swann a base offense level of 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1 (2003); (2) added 2 levels because Swann’s conduct involved more than\n\none bribe, pursuant to § 2C1.1(b)(1); (3) added 22 levels because the net profit or\n\nbenefit ($42,460,880)114 to the contractors in connection with their bribes of Swann\n\nwas between $20 million and $50 million, pursuant to §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) and\n\n2B1.1(b)(1)(L); and (4) added 2 levels for obstruction of justice, pursuant to\n\n§ 3C1.1.115 A total offense level of 36 and a criminal history category of I yielded\n\nan advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months’ imprisonment.\n\n       The PSI provided a detailed financial analysis of Swann’s assets, including\n\nhis cash, checking and savings accounts, savings bonds, deferred compensation\n\naccount, debt, investments, income, and living expenses. The PSI reported Swann\n\nhad $118,194 in assets, including $109,380 in deferred compensation, $95,000 in\n\n\n       114\n          Swann’s PSI calculated this $42,460,880 in profit as follows: (1) from September\n1998 to October 2002, RAST received $127,182,375 through County contracts and earned an\naverage profit of 17.5%, yielding $22,256,740 in profit; (2) from September 1998 to November\n2002, FWDE received $23,884,498 through County contracts and earned an average profit of\n12%, yielding $2,866,139 in profit; and (3) PUGH’s total profits for 2001 and 2002 amounted to\n$17,338,000.\n        We recognize that McNair’s PSI showed total contractor profits of $67,980,043, but\nMcNair’s PSI included $3,360,686 in USI profits and $47,541,731 in PUGH profits (based on a\nlonger time span of almost four years from August 1999 to March 2002). See supra note 96.\n       115\n             The PSI for Swann used the November 1, 2003 edition of the Sentencing Manual.\n\n                                                136\n\fdebt (taxes and attorneys’ fees), and a net worth of $23,194. The PSI stated\n\nSwann’s monthly income was $6,729 ($6,604 in Jefferson County pension and\n\n$125 salary for niece’s trust fund). Thus, at the time of the PSI, Swann had an\n\nannual income of $80,748.\n\n       The PSI reported that Swann’s total monthly expenses were $6,971,\n\ncalculated as follows:\n\n       Necessary Living Expenses\n         Home Mortgage/Equity Line (645 Winwood)                     $2,321.00\n         Home Mortgage/Equity Line (641 Winwood)                     $1,201.00\n         Groceries/Supplies/Transportation                           $1,435.00\n                (Includes all credit card purchases\n                other than non-copay medical\n                expenses.)\n         Utilities                                                     $452.00\n         Telephone                                                     $118.00\n         Auto Insurance                                                $122.00\n         Life Insurance                                               $395.00\n         Home Maintenance Insurance                                     $36.00\n         Clothing                                                       $20.00\n         Medical                                                       $488.00\n         Printing/Copying/Postage                                       $60.00\n         Dry Cleaning                                                   $10.00\n         Pest Control/Termite Bond                                      $48.00\n         OTC Medications/Personal Grooming                            $122.00\n         Lawn Maintenance                                             $120.00\n         Internet Service                                               $23.00\n       Total Expenses:                                               $6,971.00[116]\n\n       The PSI noted (1) Swann’s wife was retired from Bellsouth, (2) their newly\n\n\n       116\n         Swann also submitted other expenses as “necessary,” which the PSI did not include in\nthe above calculations as “necessary”: meals out $75; entertainment $30; and newspaper $12.40.\n\n                                             137\n\fremodeled home at 645 Winwood Drive was in her name, and (3) she owned their\n\nformer home, at 641 Winwood Drive two doors down, jointly with her mother and\n\npaid that mortgage.117 According to the PSI, Swann’s wife had refused to provide\n\nany additional financial information for the PSI. Swann claimed he had no\n\nknowledge of the value of his wife’s investments, nor of the income generated\n\nfrom her investments or retirement.\n\n       In calculating Swann’s fine under 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d),118 the PSI stated the\n\n“gross loss” amount was the $42,460,880 benefit the contractors received. Based\n\non this information, the PSI determined the guidelines fine range was $20,000 to\n\n$84,921,760 (i.e., double the gross loss amount pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2).\n\nThe PSI stated: “Based on his financial condition it appears that the defendant\n\n[Swann] could pay a fine within the guideline range or make a lump-sum payment\n\ntoward restitution shortly after sentencing through use of liquid assets.” The PSI\n\nnoted that Swann’s “future ability to make payments on an installment basis will\n\n\n\n       117\n         Swann filed no objections to ¶¶ 153-159 of the PSI that set forth all of this financial\ninformation.\n       118\n          Section 3571(d) provides:\n       If any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in\n       pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not\n       more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss, unless\n       imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the\n       sentencing process.\n18 U.S.C. § 3571(d).\n\n                                                138\n\fbe dependant [sic] on several factors including the sentence in this case, his family\n\nsituation, and his ability to contain monthly expenses.”\n\n       The PSI stated that restitution was mandatory under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3663A(a)(1) (the MVRA) and that the County had requested restitution.\n\n       Swann objected to the 22-level increase to his offense level under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), arguing his offense level should be based on the amount of\n\nbribes ($355,533) rather than the net profits or benefits ($42,460,880) the\n\ncontractors received. Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) provides:\n\n       If the value of the payment, the benefit received or to be received in\n       return for the payment, or the loss to the government from the offense,\n       whichever is greatest (i) exceeded $2,000 but did not exceed $5,000,\n       increase by 1 level; or (ii) exceeded $5,000, increase by the number of\n       levels from the table in §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud)\n       corresponding to that amount.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) (2003).119 Swann argued there was no evidence of a\n\ncausal connection linking any bribe to the award of any contract, and therefore, the\n\n22-level adjustment under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) was improper. Even if a quid pro quo\n\nis not required for a § 666 conviction, Swann claimed evidence of a quid pro quo\n\nwas necessary under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) to increase his offense level.\n\nB.     Sentencing Hearing\n\n\n       119\n          The guidelines provide that for an offense where the benefit received or loss to the\ngovernment is more than $20 million but not more than $50 million, a defendant’s offense level\nwill increase by 22 levels. U.S.S.G. §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2B1.1(b)(1)(L).\n\n                                              139\n\f       At sentencing, Swann objected to the PSI on the ground that co-defendants\n\nRAST, Bobby Rast, and Danny Rast’s offense levels were based on the amount of\n\nbribes given, not the financial benefit or profit to them. Swann also objected to\n\nany obstruction of justice enhancement. The district court sustained Swann’s\n\nobjection to the obstruction enhancement.120\n\n       The district court, however, concluded the benefit, not bribe, amount should\n\nbe used under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) and found the evidence was “absolutely clear that\n\nthere is at least 20 million dollars that was benefit” to the bribe-payor contractors.\n\nAs support for the $20 million figure, the district court cited instances where\n\nSwann (1) decided not to invoke the performance bond against RAST, (2) allowed\n\nRAST to rebid the Valley Creek job for an additional $23.927 million, and (3) was\n\ninvolved in granting RAST a $2.677 million change order when RAST’s boring\n\nmachine became stuck. The district court found that a preponderance of the\n\nevidence established that the $20 million benefit to the bribe-payors “was a direct\n\nresult of that influence of [RAST’s] bribes.” The court also pointed out that Swann\n\n\n       120\n           Because some of Swann’s co-defendants were sentenced under an earlier guidelines\nedition and that edition would result in a lower guidelines range for him, Swann urged the court\nto use the earlier edition to avoid a sentencing disparity with his co-defendants. The district\ncourt overruled that objection.\n        On appeal Swann does not challenge the applicability of the 2003 guidelines edition to\nthe calculations of his advisory guidelines range. Rather, as discussed later, Swann claims his\nsentence is substantively unreasonable because the use of different editions as to co-defendants\ncaused disparities in his and his co-defendants’ sentences that are unwarranted. We address that\nissue later.\n\n                                              140\n\fgranted PUGH’s joint venture a 180-day extension just days after PUGH’s Yessick\n\nhired a landscaper for Swann’s property, saving PUGH’s joint venture $180,000 in\n\nliquidated damages. At sentencing, the district court expressly found a direct\n\nconnection between the bribes to Swann and the financial benefit to the bribe-\n\npayor contractors, stating:\n\n      I think it is absolutely clear that there is at least 20 million dollars that\n      was benefit, for instance, to [RAST], two change orders being 2.677\n      million of the digging out of the boring machine and pulling out a boring\n      machine and rebid of that job, 23.927 million. The testimony as I recall\n      it at trial and the testimony that was presented today, I conclude, based\n      on the burden of proof that’s required, not beyond a reasonable doubt but\n      by a preponderance of the evidence, that that is due to be calculated at\n      2B1.1 as a gain of over 20 million dollars, that because of the decision\n      by Mr. Swann that I believe was a result of the bribes and stuff that was\n      provided him by RAST, I think that that was a direct result of that\n      influence of those bribes. And I am not going to go through the others.\n      Like for instance, the extensions, just one example is with regard to\n      exhibit 36, the 180 extension that was granted to PUGH. A thousand\n      dollars a day is what I recall the evidence to be that it would have been\n      if they weren’t granted that extension and that’s $180,000. I am not even\n      necessarily having to go to the aspect of whether or not because Mr.\n      Swann was Mr. Wilson’s supervisor the effect of the contracts or the\n      approval of the committee because I find I am going to, for calculation\n      of fine purposes, set that amount at 20 million and one dollars. More\n      than 20 million, I am going to set it at 20 million and one dollars as\n      clearly – in fact, actually I think I figured it at 26 million at the bottom\n      end, but I am going to set it at 20 million and one dollars for the purpose\n      of calculating the fine range, and I will ask him that you do that for me,\n      and we’ll need to recalculate the other.\n\n      The district court found that Swann’s base offense level was 10, added 2\n\nlevels because Swann’s offenses involved multiple bribes, and added 22 levels\n\n                                          141\n\fbecause the benefit to the bribe-payor contractors was between $20 million and\n\n$50 million, resulting in a total offense level of 34. See U.S.S.G.\n\n§§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), 2B1.1(b)(1). This total offense level of 34 and a criminal\n\nhistory category of I yielded an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months’\n\nimprisonment.\n\n       In considering the § 3553 factors, the district court found that Swann (1) was\n\nnot credible in stating his wife was the one responsible and he did not know that\n\nthese contractors were doing the work and what was going on, (2) had “not\n\nindicated any remorse whatsoever,” and (3) refused to accept responsibility. The\n\ndistrict court also considered that it was “bribery on a large scale of a public\n\nofficial” that had affected many people. The court noted “the need to reflect the\n\nseriousness of this offense and to promote respect for the law and to provide just\n\npunishment for this offense.” The court also commented that, because Swann held\n\na position of public trust, he was different than the contractor-defendants that were\n\nbribing him. The district court stated it had considered all of the § 3553 factors.\n\nCiting Swann’s “history” and “character,” the district court varied downward from\n\nthe 151 to 188 months’ range and imposed a sentence of 102 months’\n\nimprisonment, followed by 3 years’ supervised release.121\n\n\n       121\n        As to Counts 51 and 90 to 100, the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months’\nimprisonment, to run concurrently. As to Counts 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, and 60, the district court\n\n                                               142\n\f       Importantly, the district court also stated that, even if it had adopted Swann’s\n\nview that the U.S.S.G. § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) calculation should be based on the bribe\n\namount Swann received (instead of the net benefit to the contractors) and even if\n\nSwann’s total offense level was 24 and his guidelines range was 51 to 63 months,\n\nit would nonetheless vary upward on Swann’s sentence, explaining:\n\n       [C]ounsel has urged me to utilize the guideline range that would result\n       from considering the bribes of $355,533 in calculating your sentencing\n       range and indicated that if I used that, it would result in a guideline\n       offense level, criminal offense level of 24 when combined with a\n       criminal history category of roman numeral one would result in\n       imprisonment range of 51 to 63 months. I am going to state for the\n       record that if I used that, I would nonetheless vary upward because I\n       would believe that would not be sufficient to account for the other\n       factors in [18 U.S.C. § 3553] that I am charged with the responsibility of\n       weighing, including the nature and circumstances of this particular\n       offense, as well as the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\n       provide respect for law. I would have varied upwards, in other words,\n       on that sentence. So if the Eleventh Circuit has any question about that\n       when they get this on appeal which I suppose they will, if they ask or\n       wonder what I would have done had I went that way, that’s what I would\n       have done. I believe that’s appropriate and I have given that weight. I\n       have actually considered that, and I started to just go ahead and do that.\n       But I thought it appropriate in this instance because I think it is very\n       clear that at least the 23 million dollars that I discussed earlier was a\n       correct calculation.\n\n(Emphasis added). Although the district court did not say the precise words — “I\n\nwould impose the same 102 months sentence” — the record is patently clear that is\n\n\n\nimposed a sentence of 102 months’ imprisonment, to run concurrently. The sentences for all 18\ncounts thus run concurrently.\n\n                                             143\n\fwhat the district court meant.\n\n       As to restitution, Swann disputed that the amount of the bribes paid was\n\n$355,533, but conceded that, if restitution was owed, it should be based on the\n\namount of bribes paid. Based on the evidence, the district court found the total\n\nbribe amount Swann received was $355,533. The district court rejected Swann’s\n\nargument that restitution should be only the total $93,680 bribe amount referenced\n\nin the conviction counts (Counts 52-54, 57-58, 60, 90-100) that the jury found\n\nSwann received beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court ordered Swann to\n\npay restitution of $355,533122 to the “Jefferson County Commission.”\n\n       As to the fine, Swann pointed out he “has no money,” that his house was\n\ntransferred to his wife’s name before he became aware of the subpoenas in the\n\ninvestigation, and that he lost the respect of his community and thereby lost his\n\nability to earn a living. Swann argued for a reduced fine but did not propose any\n\nspecific fine amount.\n\n\n\n       122\n          This $355,533 consisted of:\n       (1) $149,102 from PUGH ($7,422 for waterfall and koi pond, $1,000 in gift certificates to\nAlabama Book Smith, and $140,680 in landscaping by Guthrie);\n       (2) $55,885 from RAST ($4,441 for concrete work; $3,535 for flooring; $1,054 in brick\nwork; $8,940 in plumbing; $9,733 for painting; $6,300 to Derek Houston for supervision;\n$18,867 in labor for miscellaneous employees; and $3,015 for Swann’s trip to England and\nScotland); and\n       (3) $150,929 from FWDE ($28,839 to Stanger for supervision; $94,090 to Hendon for\nsupervision; and $28,000 to Dudley Davis for framing). The sentencing court and its judgment\nuse $355,533, and we do too. But these amounts total $355,933.\n\n                                              144\n\f       After determining the advisory guidelines fine range was $17,500 to\n\n$40,000,002, the court imposed a $250,000 fine and a $1,800 special assessment.\n\nAs to the $250,000 fine, the district court stated:\n\n       You are ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $250,000. I don’t know\n       whether that’s collectable or not. I don’t think it is, but I think it’s\n       appropriate considering the circumstances.\n\nC.     Guidelines Range Calculations\n\n       On appeal Swann claims the district court improperly calculated his\n\nguidelines range because “[t]he court utilized a ‘net benefit’ approach instead of\n\nthe amount of the alleged bribes in calculating the base offense level.” This is a\n\nchallenge to the procedural reasonableness of Swann’s 102 months’ imprisonment\n\nsentence.123\n\n       As noted earlier, the bribery offense level is calculated using the greater of\n\nthe value of the bribe payment or the benefit received in return. See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A). “The value of ‘the benefit received or to be received’ means the\n\n\n\n\n       123\n           In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we apply an abuse-of-discretion\nstandard using a two-step process.

First, we\nlook at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as\nmiscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to\nconsider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,\nor failing to explain adequately the sentence.

(2) A $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a\nbribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000.” U.S.S.G. § 2C1.1 cmt. n.2.\n        The Commentary to § 2C1.1 also provides: “[F]or deterrence purposes, the punishment\nshould be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is\nhigher.” Id. cmt.

DeVegter, 439 F.3d at 1304, this Court adopted the Fifth Circuit’s\napproach to calculating net value under § 2C1.1 as set forth in United States v. Landers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706846\"><a href=\"/opinion/706846/united-states-v-claude-edward-landers/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1995). The Fifth Circuit in Landers concluded that the profit on a contract, not the\ngross revenue or value, is to be used to determine net value. We stated in DeVegter, “[w]e agree\nwith the Fifth Circuit’s approach [in Landers] which subtracts direct costs, but not indirect costs,\nfrom profits to determine the net improper benefit.” DeVegter, 439 F.3d at 1304.\n       126\n           Swann’s appeal brief refers to the $20 million as the “net benefit” and does not argue\nthat the district court erred by using $20 million in its calculation of net benefit. Although the\ndistrict court’s finding that the benefit was $20 million to the contractor-defendants appears to be\nbased on gross revenue received by the contractor-defendants and not their net profit, other\nportions of the trial record amply support total profits in excess of $20 million to the contractor-\ndefendants RAST, PUGH, and FWDE, and thus a net benefit in excess of $20 million. This may\nbe why no remand was requested on this issue.\n\n                                                146\n\fparticular bribe and a particular contract or action by a public official. Swann\n\nclaims the government’s evidence failed to show the requisite causal connection.\n\n      In this regard, Swann first argues there is no connection between the bribes\n\nhe received and the contractors’ revenue because he had no authority to award the\n\nsewer or engineering contracts. Alternatively, Swann claims, “there was no tie or\n\nconnection of any kind between any alleged bribe and any contract awarded even if\n\nAppellant Swann could have influenced the award of the contract.” Therefore,\n\nSwann says, “the proper loss amount to be utilized under § 2C1.1 was the amount\n\nof the alleged bribes paid to Appellant Swann and the court erred in failing to\n\nutilize said amount.” Swann points out that had the $355,533 bribe amount been\n\nused (as opposed to the $20 million benefit amount), the district court would have\n\nadded only 12 levels (not 22) under § 2C1.1, resulting in a total adjusted offense\n\nlevel of 24 (not 34).\n\n      This Court has not addressed what type of connection under\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) the government must establish between the bribe given and the\n\nbenefit received. Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) does speak in terms of “the value of . . .\n\nthe benefit received or to be received in return for the payment . . . .” U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A). Other circuits have held that the threshold for establishing a\n\ncausal connection under § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) is low. See United States v.

Sapoznik, 161 F.3d at 1119. And\n\nthe bribes need only contribute or facilitate the business activity involved. Id.\n\n       Here, given the wealth of evidence in the record, we readily conclude the\n\ndistrict court did not clearly err in finding that the benefits the contractors received\n\n(such as the RAST revenue from the $2.6 million change order, the RAST job\n\nrebid for an additional $23,837,350, and the PUGH time extension on the Vestavia\n\nTrunk Sewer Replacement project) were a result of the corrupt bribes to Swann.\n\nThis amply satisfies any causal connection requirement in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).127\n\n\n       127\n          We review the district court’s findings of fact in sentencing for clear error.

The district court also did not err in considering Swann was a public\n\nofficial, another characteristic of the defendant. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).\n\n      Swann further argues there was an unwarranted disparity between his 102-\n\nmonth sentence and those of his co-defendants Bobby Rast (51 months), Danny\n\nRast (41 months), and Dougherty (51 months). Swann claims Bobby and Danny\n\nRast received lower sentences because the district court sentenced them using the\n\nbribe amount (not the net benefit amount) in calculating their guidelines ranges\n\n\n\n\n                                          151\n\funder § 2C1.1.130 Swann argues that in using the net benefit in his case, the district\n\ncourt created sentencing disparity with similarly situated co-defendants because it\n\nhad utilized different methods to calculate the guidelines range for various co-\n\ndefendants. This ignores a number of factors that differentiate Swann from these\n\nparticular co-defendants: (1) Swann was a public official and the private\n\ncontractors were not, (2) Swann took bribes not just from the Rast defendants but\n\nalso from the Pugh and Dougherty defendants, (3) the district court found Swann\n\nnot credible in stating he did not understand the home remodeling work was\n\nintended to influence him, and (4) Swann showed a lack of remorse. Simply put,\n\nSwann has not proved he and these particular co-defendants are similarly situated.\n\n       As to FWDE and Dougherty, Swann also argues they received lower\n\nsentences because the district court applied an earlier edition of the sentencing\n\nguidelines. As to FWDE, Swann is incorrect because the PSI and the district court\n\napplied the 2003 guidelines to calculate FWDE’s sentence. As to Dougherty, the\n\n2000 guidelines were used. Under the 2000 guidelines, a $20 million net benefit\n\nresulted in a 16-level increase, rather than the 22-level increase in the 2003\n\nversion. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(Q), (R) (2000) with § 2B1.1(b)(1)(L),\n\n\n\n       130\n        Judge L. Scott Coogler conducted the Swann and Wilson trials and sentenced Swann on\nMarch 30, 2007, the Rast defendants on March 29, 2007, and the Dougherty defendants on\nMarch 28, 2007. Different judges sentenced McNair and PUGH.\n\n                                            152\n\f(M) (2003).131 That a district court may have used the wrong version of the\n\nguidelines in a co-defendant’s separate sentencing (to the benefit of a defendant)\n\ndoes not make another defendant’s sentence under the correct version unreasonable\n\nin any way. In addition, the Dougherty defendants’ profits were much lower than\n\nthe Pugh and Rast defendants, who also gave bribes to Swann. Also, Swann\n\nignores the fact that the district court granted a downward variance to 102 months\n\nfrom his advisory guidelines range of 151-188 months. Swann has shown no\n\nreversible error in his 102-month sentence based on disparity with his co-\n\ndefendants.\n\nE.     Swann’s Fine\n\n       The district court ordered that Swann pay a fine of $250,000, based on a fine\n\nguidelines range of $20,000 to approximately $84 million. See U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2.\n\nSwann argues that the district court erred in not considering any of the fine\n\nguidelines factors, including Swann’s ability to pay.\n\n       The sentencing guidelines require courts to “impose a fine in all cases,\n\nexcept where the defendant establishes he is unable to pay and is not likely to\n\nbecome able to pay any fine.” U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a). The defendant has the burden\n\n\n       131\n          With a 16-level increase, Swann’s total offense level would be 28, which, with a\ncriminal history category of I, would yield an advisory guidelines range of 78 to 97 months\nunder the 2000 guidelines. For Dougherty, the PSI used the 2000 edition, and, apparently, there\nwas no objection by the government.\n\n                                              153\n\fof proving inability to pay a fine.

We quoted\n\nthe PSI earlier as it (1) says that Swann could pay a fine or make a lump-sum\n\npayment toward restitution shortly after sentencing with liquid assets, and then (2)\n\n\n\n                                           155\n\fstates it does not determine Swann’s future ability to pay a fine or further\n\nrestitution on an installment basis.\n\n       Furthermore, the district court adopted the factual findings in the PSI, which\n\nincluded numerous findings relevant to Swann’s current income and future earning\n\ncapacity. The PSI set forth Swann’s net worth, educational background, work\n\nhistory, and monthly income of $6,729, yielding $80,748 annually. Swann holds\n\ntwo bachelors degrees, one in civil engineering and one in textile management, and\n\na masters degree in sanitary engineering. Swann has retired from Jefferson County\n\nbut submitted no evidence to show he had tried and failed to gain employment.\n\nSwann already has an annual retirement income of $80,748 even without social\n\nsecurity or future wages from working.133\n\n       Although Swann makes two mortgage payments on the two Winwood Drive\n\nresidences and pays over $658 in monthly home utility, lawn, pest control, and\n\nmaintenance expenses, the homes are in his wife’s name and she lives there too.\n\nThe record shows Swann can pay at least some fine. The record also shows\n\nSwann’s counsel argued for a reduced fine and the district court considered the\n\npertinent factors. As the district court reviewed the PSI before imposing the fine\n\nand heard argument of counsel about the fine, “we infer without hesitation that the\n\n\n       133\n        The PSI, dated February 5, 2007, did not show Swann drawing any social security. In\n2010, Swann is now 64.\n\n                                            156\n\fdistrict court considered the pertinent factors prior to imposing the fine.” Khawaja,\n\n118 F.3d at 1459.\n\n      Although Swann has shown no clear error in the district court’s imposition\n\nof some fine, the record is not sufficient to permit us to say there is no error in the\n\namount of the fine. As to the $250,000 amount, the district court remarked: “I\n\ndon’t know whether that’s collectable or not. I don’t think it is . . . .” We cannot\n\nglean from the record the basis for this statement or how the court determined that\n\nthe fine should be $250,000 as opposed to $150,000 or $750,000, especially given\n\nthe fine guidelines range goes up to $84 million. Thus, we vacate and remand as to\n\nthe amount of the fine. See Khawaja, 118 F.3d at 1459-60 (requiring remand\n\nwhere record does not reflect court’s reasoned basis for amount of $175,000 fine).\n\n                            XIV. PUGH’S SENTENCE\n\n      PUGH was sentenced to 60 months’ probation on four bribery conspiracy\n\ncounts (Counts 1 involving McNair, 51 involving Swann, 75 involving Wilson,\n\nand 78 involving Barber), nine substantive bribery counts (Counts 15, 61-63, 71,\n\n83-86), and eleven counts of honest services mail fraud (Counts 90-100). The\n\ndistrict court ordered PUGH to pay a $19.4 million fine, a special assessment of\n\n$9,600, and $239,652 in restitution to the Jefferson County Commission. On\n\nappeal, PUGH challenges only the fine.\n\n\n\n                                           157\n\fA.     Presentence Report\n\n       The PSI stated that PUGH performed nearly $200 million worth of\n\nconstruction work for sewer projects for Jefferson County between 1997 and 2003\n\nand that a majority of this work was for JCESD-related projects. The PSI listed\n\nbribes given by PUGH to McNair, Swann, Chandler, Barber, and Wilson, totaling\n\n$395,514.134 The PSI stated that PUGH had this net income: $19.09 million in\n\n2001, $15.32 million in 2002, $9.10 million in 2003, $2.94 million in 2004, and\n\n$3.67 million in 2005. PUGH’s federal tax returns reported net income of $17.89\n\nmillion in 2001, $14.95 million in 2002, $8.10 million in 2003, $3 million in 2004,\n\nand $3.97 million in 2005.\n\n       According to the PSI, PUGH received more than $109 million in JCESD\n\ncontracts related to the bribery conspiracy from August 1999 to June 2003. This\n\n$109 million reflected only PUGH’s portion of its joint venture work for Jefferson\n\nCounty. The PSI determined that from 1999 to 2002 PUGH earned an average\n\n\n\n       134\n          This $395,514 in restitution consists of PUGH’s payments of:\n       (1) $192,000 to McNair ($175,000 for construction, remodeling, and cash for his studio\nand $17,200 installation of hand railings for his studio);\n       (2) $149,102 to Swann ($140,680 for Guthrie Landscaping, $7,422 for installation of\nwaterfall and pond, and $1,000 in gift certificates to Alabama Book Smith);\n       (3) $610 to Chandler for condominium rental at Pelican Beach Condominiums;\n       (4) $49,102 to Barber ($47,927 for McCalla, Alabama land, $148 for casino trip to\nVicksburg, Mississippi, $546 resort trip to Biloxi, Mississippi, and $481 trip to Gulf Shores,\nAlabama); and\n       (5) $4,500 to Wilson (UAB scholarship).\n\n                                              158\n\fprofit of 43.61% and that PUGH’s profit from County contracts was $47.92\n\nmillion.135\n\n       The PSI: (1) assigned PUGH a base offense level of 10, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2C1.1(a) (2003); (2) added 2 levels because the offense involved more than one\n\nbribe, pursuant to § 2C1.1(b)(1); and (3) added 22 levels because the net profit to\n\nPUGH was between $20 million and $50 million, pursuant to §§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A)\n\nand 2B1.1(b)(1)(L),136 yielding a total offense level of 34.137 Under the § 8C2.4(d)\n\ntable, this total offense level of 34 required a base fine amount of $28.5 million.\n\n       However, the PSI determined PUGH’s pecuniary gain under § 8C2.4(a)(2)\n\nwas its $47.92 million profit from the County contracts. Under § 8C2.4(a), the\n\nbase fine amount became $47.92 million, because PUGH’s $47.92 million\n\npecuniary gain was greater than the $28.5 million amount from the § 8C2.4(d) fine\n\ntable and greater than the pecuniary loss of $319,425 suffered by the victim\n\n\n\n       135\n          PUGH later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time PUGH’s PSI was prepared,\nthe bankruptcy case was pending. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court confirmed PUGH’s\nproposed plan of liquidation. See In re Roland Pugh Constr., Inc., No. Bk-06-71769-CMS-11,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">509225</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Bankr. N.D. Ala. Feb. 12, 2007). The bankruptcy court ordered PUGH to\nestablish a trust account in the amount of $19,409,600, which would be used to pay the federal\ncriminal fine assessed in the present case. In re Roland Pugh Constr., Inc., No. Bk-06-71769-\nCMS-11 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. Apr. 21, 2008).\n       136\n           The PSI listed the table section as “§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(M)” but applied the enhancement\nlisted in § 2B1.1(b)(1)(L) of that table, which provides a 22-level enhancement for amounts\nbetween $20 million and $50 million.\n       137\n             The PSI for PUGH used the November 1, 2003 edition of the Sentencing Manual.\n\n                                               159\n\fCounty.\n\n      The PSI determined PUGH’s culpability score was 7 under § 8C2.5, because\n\n(1) PUGH had 50 or more employees and (2) individuals with substantial authority\n\n(Board Chairman Roland Pugh, CEO Grady Pugh, and President Yessick)\n\nparticipated in the offenses. This culpability score of 7 resulted in a minimum fine\n\nmultiplier of 1.4 and a maximum multiplier of 2.8, under § 8C2.6. Based on these\n\nmultipliers and the base fine of approximately $47.92 million, the PSI calculated\n\nthe guidelines fine range to be $67,089,446.48 to $134,178,892.96.\n\n      The statutory maximum fine was $95,842,066, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3571(b), (d) (i.e., double the pecuniary gain of $47.92 million). Thus, the PSI\n\nconcluded PUGH’s advisory guidelines fine range was $67,089,446 to\n\n$95,842,066.\n\n      The PSI stated PUGH appeared unable to pay a fine within that $67 million\n\nto $95 million guidelines range and recommended the district court reduce the fine\n\nif it determined PUGH was unable to pay the minimum fine amount. The PSI\n\nnoted that, under § 8C3.4, the guidelines fine could be offset by 67.75%, because\n\n(1) PUGH was a closely held organization, (2) three of PUGH’s owners (Roland\n\nPugh, Yessick, and Grady Pugh) whose total interests amounted to 67.75% had\n\nalready been fined for the same offense conduct, and (3) one owner (Andy Pugh)\n\n\n\n                                         160\n\fhad a 32.25% interest and was not convicted in the bribery scheme.\n\n       PUGH objected to the PSI’s calculation of profits or pecuniary gain. PUGH\n\nargued there was no evidence that PUGH obtained any contracts, or the $47.92\n\nmillion in profits, because of its bribes. PUGH contended its base offense level\n\nshould be based on the $129,138.81 amount of bribes PUGH paid, which would\n\nresult in a total offense level of 22 and a base fine of $1.2 million.138\n\nB.     Supplemental Briefing Before Sentencing\n\n       The district court ordered briefs addressing the fine amount. PUGH’s brief\n\nreiterated its challenge to the PSI’s calculations, arguing there was no evidence the\n\nCounty suffered any pecuniary loss from the bribery scheme.\n\n       The government recalculated PUGH’s pecuniary gain based on a job-by-job\n\nanalysis of PUGH’s contracts with the County. The government submitted a list of\n\nbribery and post-bribery jobs, which showed the revenue earned, gross profit, gross\n\nprofit percentage, and “improper gain” for each job. The government calculated an\n\naverage unit price for items used by PUGH in eight of its projects over a 20-month\n\nperiod from 2001 to 2002 and then compared those prices for this time period to\n\nthe average unit price PUGH charged the County for these items during the bribery\n\n\n\n       138\n         PUGH’s total did not use certain amounts that were included in the PSI, such as (1)\n$60,696 that PUGH claimed Swann repaid to PUGH, (2) $37,000 worth of unperformed work on\nSwann’s home that PUGH paid Guthrie for, and (3) $167,679 in items PUGH gave to McNair.\n\n                                            161\n\fperiod of 1997 to 2001. The government determined PUGH’s improper gain was\n\n$24.667 million, while PUGH made about $20 million in “normal profit.” Based\n\non the improper gain of $24.667 million and applicable multipliers, the\n\ngovernment concluded PUGH’s guidelines fine range was $34.533 million to\n\n$69.067 million.139\n\n       PUGH’s reply brief then challenged the government’s recalculation for\n\nfailing to account for a price increase that occurred in 2003 and for using\n\nartificially low post-bribery prices in 2001 and 2002. PUGH claims this skewed\n\nthe government’s analysis of PUGH’s profits to reflect greater profits during the\n\nbribery period. PUGH also claimed that, to prove PUGH profited from the bribery\n\nscheme, the government had to show that PUGH’s bribes caused the PRC to limit\n\nthe number of cured-in-place contracts.\n\nC.     Sentencing Hearing\n\n       The district court conducted a lengthy sentencing hearing, including two\n\ndays of evidence and a partial day of argument on evidence assessment and factual\n\n\n       139\n           When comparing the unit prices of bribery-period and post-bribery jobs, the\ngovernment’s analysis used only PUGH’s sewer rehab jobs — and not other jobs such as\nwastewater treatments, trunk sewer jobs, and annual contracts — so that the analysis would\nreflect an “apples-to-apples” comparison. FBI Agent Tom Mayhall stated PUGH earned about\n$55 million from other work from the County, which was not included in the improper gain\ncalculation.\n        Although the government points out PUGH continued to make some bribes in 2001 and\nwell into 2002, the majority of PUGH’s bribes were given prior to December 31, 2000, and the\ngovernment thus compared the profit before the end of 2000 with that in 2001-02.\n\n                                             162\n\fdeterminations. The government presented evidence as to the bribes PUGH paid\n\nand the revenue and profits PUGH earned from its County contracts during the\n\nbribery scheme. For example, FBI Agent Tom Mayhall calculated PUGH’s\n\nimproper gains by comparing (1) the average unit price of items on invoices for\n\nsewer rehab jobs PUGH submitted to the County during the bribery scheme\n\nthrough the end of 2000 with (2) the average unit price of items on eight sewer\n\nrehab jobs PUGH performed in 2001 and 2002. Based on this comparison, Agent\n\nMayhall concluded PUGH’s improper gain was approximately $24.667 million.140\n\nAgent Mayhall testified about PUGH’s bribes to County employees and the\n\nbenefits PUGH received from its County contracts and as a result of the PRC’s\n\ndecisions. PUGH maintained that the increase in profits was not substantial and\n\nwas based on areas of PUGH’s business other than its work for the County.\n\n       The district court rejected the government’s pricing analysis, finding that the\n\nevidence failed to show the line items in PUGH’s contracts were affected by the\n\nbribes PUGH paid. The court found PUGH paid bribes to County employees\n\nbecause PUGH was “afraid of what might happen if [it] did not do so” and that\n\n\n       140\n           Agent Mayhall testified PUGH made about $44.536 million total gross profit on about\n$109 million in revenue on JCESD rehab jobs during the bribery period. Mayhall testified that\nof this $44.536 million total gross profit, about $19.869 million was a result of PUGH’s normal\nprofit margin, and the remaining $24.667 million was therefore improper gain. Mayhall added\nthat PUGH had about $22 million in cash on hand, which earned about $77,000 per month in\ninterest, and bankruptcy creditors claimed less than $200,000 of that cash.\n\n                                              163\n\f“what might have happened is that [PUGH] might have lost all its contracts, those\n\ncurrent and future, with the County and the profits associated with those\n\ncontracts.”141 The court further found, for example, “that the Swann bribes . . .\n\nwere designed to ensure that [PUGH] stayed in good favor with Mr. Swann so that\n\n[PUGH] would have and continue to have the opportunity to receive contracts and\n\nbe paid on contracts from Jefferson County.” The court later stated “there [was] an\n\nexpectation that if you do business with the County, you’re expected to do this.\n\nAnd I think that the reason [PUGH] did it was because others were doing it and it\n\nwanted to protect the contracts it had.”\n\n      The court also found that, beginning in August 1999, PUGH started making\n\nbribes “in order to maintain its standing in the revenues and profits realized in the\n\ncontracts awarded by Jefferson County; and, indeed, they became extremely high\n\nprofits during that bribe period.”\n\n      The district court found that PUGH made its first bribe in August 1999 and\n\nits final bribe in September 2002. The court found that (1) from September 1,\n\n1999 to December 31, 2002, PUGH benefitted from the bribes, (2) during this\n\n1999-2002 period PUGH generated from its County contracts a total profit of\n\n\n\n\n      141\n            Judge David R. Proctor conducted the Barber trial and sentenced the Pugh defendants.\n\n                                                164\n\f$43,985,869,142 and (3) given PUGH’s $107,887,832 in revenues, this $43,985,869\n\nprofit was a 40.77% profit margin during that period. Using that profit to calculate\n\nthe base fine amount, the district court determined the guidelines fine range was\n\n$61,580,216 to $87,971,738. See U.S.S.G. §§ 8C2.5, 8C2.7. After considering\n\nPUGH’s ability to pay, the district court reduced the fine to $21 million. The\n\ndistrict court then gave a $1.6 million offset for fines paid by individuals who\n\nowned at least 5% of PUGH, which resulted in a final fine of $19.4 million.\n\nD.     Challenges to $19.4 Million Fine\n\n       On appeal, PUGH primarily raises objections to the manner in which the\n\ndistrict court arrived at the $19.4 million fine, but none of them has merit. The PSI\n\ncontained extensive financial information about PUGH’s revenue and profits. The\n\ndistrict court’s fact-findings are supported by the record and undisputed facts in the\n\nPSI, and PUGH has shown no clear error in any of them. PUGH also has shown\n\nno legal error in any of the district court’s calculations regarding the advisory\n\nguidelines fine range or in any other matters under the sentencing guidelines.\n\n       PUGH’s brief as to the fine mainly resorts to claiming PUGH did not have\n\n       142\n          The court found, “[t]he September 1, ‘99 date signifies the first contract awarded to\nPugh by the County after the August 1999 concrete work was done for McNair.” The court\nstated: “I have not attributed any profits made by Pugh in 2003, although the government may\nwell have a good argument that profits in 2003 and revenues in 2003 continued to be effected\n[sic] because of the bribes paid in ‘99, 2000, 2001 and 2002.” The court added: “Likewise, I\nhave not attributed any pre-September 1999 gain to Pugh Construction based upon the bribe\nscheme that was in place and paid by other contractors.”\n\n                                               165\n\fadequate notice of certain arguments or adequate opportunity to respond. The\n\nrecord refutes those claims too. The parties submitted numerous sentencing briefs\n\nand offered a substantial amount of evidence as to PUGH’s revenue and profits.\n\nPUGH claims it did not know the district court would consider that the bribes were\n\npaid out of fear of losing contracts or future payments thereon. However, PUGH’s\n\ncounsel, in arguing that the bribes were unrelated to the PRC, relied on the fact that\n\nthe contractors feared what would happen if they did not pay bribes:\n\n      [L]et me explain to [the court] why I think the contractors make such\n      payments to public officials.\n      ....\n      [T]he best testimony that I heard about that was from Mr. William\n      Dawson. Mr. Dawson was an engineer, independent, who was doing\n      work for Jefferson County. . . . Mr. McNair invited him to come by the\n      studio. And when he got there, Mr. McNair said, Mr. Dawson I’ve never\n      asked you for anything before, but what I would like is for you to buy\n      me an audio-visual equipment, some sort of a projector or something of\n      that nature, and he had a book. And he said this is the model and this is\n      what I would like to have. Well, Mr. Dawson didn’t want to do that.\n      And he went home and he thought about it and finally he did it. And he\n      did it because he was afraid of what Chris McNair would do to him if he\n      didn’t.\n\n      So when these people come and put the touch on a contractor or\n      someone, I think it’s the fear of the unknown.\n\nIn closing arguments, PUGH’s trial counsel maintained that any benefits PUGH\n\nprovided to the County employees were given purely out of friendship. PUGH\n\ncannot now claim it had an inadequate opportunity to explain its motivation in\n\n\n\n                                          166\n\fpaying bribes or to prepare for the ultimate approach the district court took in\n\ndeciding on the amount of the fine. If anything, counsel’s argument succeeded in\n\nreducing the amount of the fine imposed to well below the advisory guidelines\n\nrange of $61,580,216 to $87,971,738. PUGH has shown no reversible error in any\n\nprocedural aspects of the sentencing proceedings before the district court in\n\nPUGH’s case.\n\n                                  XV. CONCLUSION\n\n        We affirm all of the defendant-appellants’ convictions except PUGH’s\n\nconviction on Count 75, which we reverse. We affirm McNair’s sentence. We\n\naffirm Swann’s sentence except as to the amount of the fine. While there was no\n\nlegal error in the imposition of some fine for Swann, we vacate and remand as to\n\nthe amount of the fine. As to PUGH’s sentence, we (1) affirm the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact as supported by the record; and (2) conclude there was no error in\n\nthe district court’s calculations under the sentencing guidelines; but (3) in light of\n\nthe reversal of its Count 75 conviction, we vacate PUGH’s sentence and remand\n\nfor resentencing without Count 75.143\n\n       AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED AND\n\n\n       143\n         PUGH was convicted and sentenced on 24 counts of conviction, and the reversal on\nCount 75 does not appear to impact its overall sentence. However, in an abundance of caution,\nwe vacate PUGH’s sentence and remand for resentencing by the district court because, at a\nminimum, Count 75 must be removed.\n\n                                              167\n\fREMANDED IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n                    168\n\f</pre>",
