INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiff Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (“PEER”) is a non-profit\n\norganization “dedicated to research and public education concerning the activities and operations\n\nof federal, state and local governments.” Compl. ¶ 4, ECF No. 2. In this Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) lawsuit, PEER seeks to compel the Environmental Protection Agency\n\n(“EPA”) to release records related to EPA’s involvement with the “suspected or actual toxic\n\ncontamination at schools in the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District” (“SMMUSD”).\n\nId. ¶ 5. Specifically, PEER objects to EPA’s decision to withhold or redact certain records\n\npursuant to certain FOIA exemptions.\n\f       Before the Court are EPA’s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF. No. 18) and PEER’s\n\nCross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 20). The motions are ripe and fully briefed.1\n\nUpon consideration of the parties’ submissions and the entire record, and for reasons explained\n\nbelow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part EPA’s motion for summary judgment and\n\ndeny PEER’s cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                     II. BACKGROUND\n\n       On August 19, 2014, PEER submitted a request for records to EPA Region 9, pursuant to\n\nFOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552. See Def.’s Statement of Material Facts (“EPA Statement”) ¶ 1, ECF No.\n\n18-1; Pl.’s Statement of Material Facts (“PEER Statement”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 20. Specifically,\n\nPEER requested:\n\n       [E]mails and other written communications and notes of all communications from\n       October 1, 2013 to the present concerning or referencing suspected or actual toxic\n       contamination with [polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”)] between named EPA\n       employees and any other EPA employees and (1) Senator Barbara Boxer, any\n       member of her staff, or the staff of the Senate Environment and Public Works\n       Committee which she chairs; (2) named members of the SMMUSD School\n       Board; (3) named members of the Malibu City Council or the City Council as a\n       group.\n\nEPA Statement ¶ 1; PEER Statement ¶ 1. PEER also sought a fee waiver, which was granted by\n\nEPA. See Decl. of Steven Armann (“Armann Decl.”) ¶ 16, ECF No. 18-3; PEER Statement ¶ 2.\n\nOn December 5, 2014, PEER brought this suit, alleging that EPA had failed to provide any\n\nrecords, as required by FOIA. See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 7. Soon after the Complaint was filed, EPA\n\nresponded to PEER’s request by releasing a group of responsive documents on December 22,\n\n2014, but withholding others pursuant to Exemptions 5 and 6 of FOIA. See Armann Decl. ¶ 17;\n\n\n       1\n        See Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“EPA Mot.”), ECF No. 18; Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF\nNo. 20; Def.’s Mem. P. & A. in Supp. Reply (“EPA Reply”), ECF No. 24; Pl.’s Reply in Supp.\nCross-Mot. Summ. J. (“PEER Reply”), ECF No. 27.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fEPA Statement ¶ 4; PEER Statement ¶ 4. Subsequent discussions between PEER and EPA led\n\nto the release of additional documents—some produced in full, and others partially redacted. See\n\nArmann Decl. ¶¶ 19–21; EPA Statement ¶¶ 5–7; PEER Statement ¶ 5. This Court ordered EPA\n\nto produce a Vaughn index providing information on redacted and fully withheld records. See\n\nMin. Order, Apr. 28, 2015. The Vaughn indices submitted with EPA’s motion for summary\n\njudgment described 451 documents withheld in part and another set of documents withheld in\n\nfull.2 See Armann Decl. ¶ 22; EPA Statement ¶ 8; PEER Statement ¶ 6. During the briefing of\n\nthese motions, EPA filed amended Vaughn indices that corrected certain errors identified by the\n\nparties and reflected EPA’s decision to release certain records that were not properly withheld.\n\nSee Notice of Filing Am. Vaughn Indices, ECF No. 26; see also Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Cross-Mot.\n\nSumm. J. (“PEER Mem.”) at 22–23, ECF No. 20 (arguing that withheld records were not intra-\n\nor inter-agency materials); Second Decl. of Steven Armann (“2d Armann Decl.”) ¶ 7, ECF No.\n\n24-1 (releasing challenged documents). Now before the Court are cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment filed by each of the parties. See generally Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“EPA Mot.”), ECF\n\nNo. 18; Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 20.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The Court’s review of the parties’ filings reveals some confusion over the number of\ndocuments withheld in full. EPA’s statement of undisputed facts refers to 2020 documents\nwithheld in full, while Mr. Armann, EPA’s declarant, refers to only 15. Compare EPA\nStatement ¶ 8 (“451 documents withheld in part and 2020 withheld in full”) with Armann Decl. ¶\n22 (“451 documents withheld in part and 15 withheld in full”). In light of EPA’s statement that\nthe agency “[i]nitially . . . identified . . . 224 documents that were withheld in full,” the 2020\nfigure appears to be an error. See EPA Statement ¶ 5. On the other hand, PEER’s statement of\nundisputed facts refers to 202 documents. See PEER Statement ¶ 6 (“451 documents withheld in\npart and 202 withheld in full”). The source of this figure is unclear.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f                                    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n                                     A. Summary Judgment\n\n       “FOIA cases typically and appropriately are decided on motions for summary judgment.”\n\nDefenders of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol, 623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing\n\nBigwood v. U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev., 484 F. Supp. 2d 68, 73 (D.D.C. 2007)). Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate where “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any\n\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A\n\n“material” fact is one capable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation. See\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute is “genuine” if there is\n\nenough evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-movant. See Scott v.\n\nHarris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007).\n\n       The principal purpose of summary judgment is to streamline litigation by disposing of\n\nfactually unsupported claims or defenses and determining whether there is a genuine need for\n\ntrial. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323–24 (1986). The movant bears the initial\n\nburden of identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. In response, the non-\n\nmovant must point to specific facts in the record that reveal a genuine issue that is suitable for\n\ntrial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court must\n\n“eschew making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence,” Czekalski v. Peters, 475\n\nF.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and all underlying facts and inferences must be analyzed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-movant, see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Nevertheless,\n\nconclusory assertions offered without any evidentiary support do not establish a genuine issue\n\nfor trial. See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f                                B. Freedom of Information Act\n\n       FOIA was enacted so that citizens could discover “what their government is up to.” U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989)\n\n(quoting EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 105 (1973)). “[D]isclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant\n\nobjective of [FOIA].” U.S. Dep’t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976).\n\n“Consistent with this purpose, agencies may withhold only those documents or portions thereof\n\nthat fall under one of nine delineated statutory exemptions.” Elliot v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 596\n\nF.3d 842, 845 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)). “[T]he exemptions are ‘explicitly\n\nexclusive.’” U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989) (quoting FAA\n\nAdm’r v. Robertson, 422 U.S. 255, 262 (1975)). And it is the agency’s burden to show that\n\nwithheld material falls within one of these exemptions. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); Elliott, 596\n\nF.3d at 845.\n\n       When assessing a summary judgment motion in a FOIA case, a court makes a de novo\n\nassessment of whether the agency has properly withheld the requested documents. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B); Judicial Watch v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 598 F. Supp. 2d 93, 95 (D.D.C.\n\n2009). To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, “the defending agency must prove that\n\neach document that falls within the class requested either has been produced, is unidentifiable or\n\nis wholly exempt from the Act’s inspection requirements.” Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\n627 F.2d 365, 368 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Nat’l Cable\n\nTelevision Ass’n v. FCC, 479 F.2d 183, 186 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).\n\n       To meet its burden, a defendant may rely on declarations that are reasonably detailed and\n\nnon-conclusory. See Citizens for Ethics & Responsibility in Wash. v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 478 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 77, 80 (D.D.C. 2007) (quoting Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f(D.C. Cir. 1981)). The agency’s justification is typically contained in a declaration or affidavit,\n\nreferred to as a “Vaughn index” after the case Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n\nAn agency’s affidavits or declarations are presumed to be submitted in good faith. See SafeCard\n\nServs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991). The purpose of a Vaughn index is “to\n\npermit adequate adversary testing of the agency’s claimed right to an exemption,” Nat’l Treasury\n\nEmps. Union v. U.S. Customs Serv., 802 F.2d 525, 527 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing Mead Data\n\nCent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)), and therefore the\n\nindex must contain “an adequate description of the records” and “a plain statement of the\n\nexemptions relied upon to withhold each record,” id. at 527 n.9.\n\n       “Ultimately, an agency’s justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it\n\nappears ‘logical’ or ‘plausible.’” Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374–75 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting\n\nGardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d 1100, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). Generally, a reviewing court should\n\n“respect the expertise of an agency” and not “overstep the proper limits of the judicial role in\n\nFOIA review.” Hayden v. Nat’l Sec. Agency/Cent. Sec. Serv., 608 F.2d 1381, 1388 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1979). Nonetheless, “exemptions from disclosure must be narrowly construed . . . and\n\nconclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions are unacceptable.” Morley v. CIA, 508\n\nF.3d 1108, 1114–15 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                         IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       As EPA correctly notes, PEER has made no objection to the sufficiency of EPA’s search\n\nfor responsive documents. See Def.’s Mem. P. & A. in Supp. Reply (“EPA Reply”) at 2 n.1,\n\nECF No. 24; see also Def.’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (“EPA Mem.”) at 5–7, ECF\n\nNo. 18 (arguing that EPA’s search was adequate). Similarly, EPA has not disputed PEER’s\n\nassertion that it constructively exhausted its administrative remedies, as required by FOIA. See\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fCompl. ¶ 8; see generally EPA Mot. (failing to raise issue of exhaustion); EPA Mem. (same).\n\nThe only issue before the Court is whether EPA’s decision to withhold certain documents, in\n\nwhole or in part, was appropriate.\n\n       Specifically, EPA has withheld documents pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6, and\n\nPEER argues that EPA has failed to meet its burden of proof that information has been properly\n\nwithheld under those provisions. Because of inadequacies with EPA’s Vaughn indices, the Court\n\nwill deny EPA’s motion for summary judgment with regard to the deliberative process privilege.\n\nThe Court will grant EPA’s motion for summary judgment for certain withholdings pursuant to\n\nthe attorney-client privilege, but deny the motion for documents, including all communications\n\nthat do not appear to include an attorney. Finally, the Court will grant summary judgment for\n\nEPA on the single remaining Exemption 6 withholding.\n\n                                         A. Exemption 5\n\n       EPA has withheld the vast majority of the records at issue in this case pursuant to FOIA\n\nExemption 5. Exemption 5 permits the withholding of “inter-agency or intra-agency\n\nmemorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in\n\nlitigation with the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). This exemption protects documents “normally\n\nprivileged in the civil discovery context,” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 365 F.3d\n\n1108, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2004), such as materials shielded by the attorney-client privilege, the\n\nattorney work-product privilege and “what is sometimes called the ‘deliberative process’\n\nprivilege,” U.S. Dep’t of the Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8\n\n(2001). In other words, Exemption 5 covers “those documents, and only those documents,\n\nnormally privileged in the civil discovery context.” Loving v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 550 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f32, 37 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). The two Exemption 5 privileges at issue in this case\n\nare the deliberative process privilege and the attorney-client privilege.\n\n                                        1. Threshold Issue\n\n       As a threshold issue, Exemption 5 only covers records that are “inter-agency or intra-\n\nagency memorandums or letters.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). In other words, the Supreme Court has\n\nstated that, for Exemption 5 to apply to a document, the “source [of the withheld document] must\n\nbe a government agency.” Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S. at 8. PEER identified four withheld\n\nrecords—PRD 634, 926, 956, and 15833—that it argued are not covered by Exemption 5 because\n\nthey involve communications with outside consultants to SMMUSD. See PEER Mem. at 22–23.\n\nIn response, EPA acknowledged PEER’s argument and stated that the agency “re-examined [the]\n\nfour documents,” determined that they were “mistakenly redacted based on the belief that they\n\nwere communications with EPA consultants,” and decided to release them in full. See EPA\n\nReply at 3 n.2; see also 2d Armann Decl. ¶ 7 (describing the release of the four documents that\n\nwere mistakenly redacted). PEER has not asserted that any other documents fail to pass over the\n\nExemption 5 threshold. In light of the parties’ resolution of the threshold issue, there is no\n\ngenuine dispute that the remaining documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 5 are intra- or\n\ninter-agency records for the purposes of Section 552(b)(5). Thus, the Court can turn to the\n\nquestion of whether EPA properly withheld materials under the deliberative process and\n\nattorney-client privileges incorporated by Exemption 5.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The Court notes that the parties use both PRD and PROD as prefixes for documents at\nissue in this case. The difference is not material, but the Court will use PRD, which both parties\nuse in their later filings and which corresponds more closely to the document identifiers found in\nthe Vaughn indices.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f                                      2. Deliberative Process\n\n       EPA relies on the deliberative process privilege to justify the vast majority of its\n\nwithholdings, but PEER makes several arguments challenging that reliance. Because the Court\n\nfinds that EPA’s Vaughn indices are inadequate, it cannot reach the question of whether the\n\nmaterial has been properly withheld under the deliberative process privilege. Instead, the Court\n\nwill direct EPA to revise its Vaughn indices, taking into account the issues addressed here.\n\n       The deliberative process privilege “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\n\nrecommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental\n\ndecisions and policies are formulated.’” Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S. at 8 (quoting NLRB v.\n\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)). The privilege is intended “to enhance the\n\nquality of agency decisions by protecting open and frank discussion among those who make\n\nthem within the Government.” Id. at 9 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The\n\nprivilege “rests on the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among\n\nthemselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news.” Id. at 8–9; see\n\nalso Dow Jones & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 917 F.2d 571, 573–74 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\n       For the deliberative process privilege to apply, a court must first determine whether the\n\nexempt document is both predecisional and deliberative. Access Reports v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\n926 F.2d 1192, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 1991). “A document is predecisional if it is generated ‘before\n\nthe adoption of an agency policy.’” McKinley v. FDIC, 744 F.

Cir. 1980)).\n\n“A document is deliberative if it ‘reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process,’” id.\n\n(quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866), “by which the decision itself is made,” Jowett, Inc. v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of the Navy, 729 F.

The “key question” in determining whether the material is\n\ndeliberative in nature “is whether disclosure of the information would ‘discourage candid\n\ndiscussion within the agency.’” Access Reports, 926 F.2d at 1195 (quoting Dudman Commc’ns\n\nCorp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 815 F.2d 1565, 1567–68 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n\n          “The need to describe each withheld document when Exemption 5 is at issue is\n\nparticularly acute because ‘the deliberative process privilege is so dependent upon the individual\n\ndocument and the role it plays in the administrative process.’” Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 44 F. Supp. 2d 295, 299 (D.D.C. 1999) (quoting Coastal States, 617\n\nF.2d at 867). Under the deliberative process privilege, “unlike other exemptions where the\n\nagency declaration and Vaughn index may be read in conjunction to provide an adequate\n\njustification for application of an exemption to a class or category of records, to sustain its\n\nburden of showing that records were properly withheld under Exemption 5, an agency must\n\nprovide in its declaration and Vaughn index precisely tailored explanations for each withheld\n\nrecord at issue.” Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA, 960 F. Supp. 2d 101, 188 (D.D.C. 2013). “The\n\nagency must establish ‘what deliberative process is involved, and the role played by the\n\ndocuments in issue in the course of that process.’” Senate of P.R. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 823\n\nF.2d 574, 585–86 (D.C.

Frontier Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 826 F. Supp. 2d\n\n157, 168 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Arthur Andersen & Co. v. IRS, 679 F.2d 254, 258 (D.C.

Adequacy of the Vaughn Indices\n\n       PEER argues that (1) EPA’s declaration and Vaughn indices are inadequate because they\n\ndo not identify specific deliberative decisions or decisionmaking processes, (2) EPA’s\n\ndeclaration and Vaughn indices are inadequate because they fail to identify the nature of the\n\nauthor’s decisionmaking authority or the relative positions in the chain of command of the author\n\nand recipients, (3) the Vaughn indices are inadequate because they provide only meaningless\n\nboilerplate descriptions of the claimed harm of disclosure, (4) EPA has failed to justify its\n\nwithholding of draft documents, (5) EPA has withheld factual or technical material that is not\n\ndeliberative, (6) EPA has withheld material that is post-decisional, and (7) many entries in the\n\nVaughn indices do not correspond with the redacted documents. See PEER Mem. at 7–24. EPA\n\nresponds that PEER’s arguments “are based upon inaccurate, ill-informed, or legally incorrect\n\nconclusions.” EPA Reply at 3. EPA argues that withheld documents do not need to be limited to\n\na particular decision or policy, that duplicative justifications may be appropriate so long as\n\nfactually distinct descriptions are provided, and that EPA has appropriately withheld\n\ndeliberations related to factual and technical material. See id. at 3–15.\n\n       PEER’s primary argument—that EPA’s Vaughn indices are inadequate because they fail\n\nto tie withheld material to an agency decision or decisionmaking process—alone succeeds in\n\ndefeating summary judgment for EPA with respect to the deliberative process privilege. See\n\nPEER Mem. at 7. Several of PEER’s other arguments also stem from this basic idea. Id. at 17\n\n(“A lot of the problem with EPA’s claims about harm stems from the fact that it has not\n\nidentified particular actions or decisions or decision-making processes . . . .”). EPA counters that\n\nit has, “where possible, identified the final agency decision associated with the document; but\n\nwhere this is not possible, an agency must merely establish ‘what deliberative process is\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\finvolved, and the role played by the documents at issue in the courts of that process.’” EPA\n\nReply at 9 (citing Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866).\n\n         EPA’s statement of the law is correct. The Supreme Court has explained that “the need\n\nto protect pre-decisional documents does not mean that the existence of the privilege turns on the\n\nability of an agency to identify a specific decision in connection with which a memorandum is\n\nprepared.” NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 151 n.18 (1975). The Court\n\nrecognized that some deliberate processes would not ripen into agency decisions, and did not\n\nwant to interfere with that process. See id. Instead, an agency may establish what deliberative\n\nprocess is involved, and the role that the withheld documents played in that process. See\n\nFormaldehyde Inst. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 889 F.2d 1118, 1123 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n         The problem with EPA’s argument is not its understanding of the law, but the application\n\nof the law to this case. EPA states that each entry in its Vaughn indices “clearly states the\n\nfunction of each document, the decision at issue, and the ability of the author or the author’s\n\nauthority to make the decision.” EPA Reply at 10. As an example, EPA quotes language that\n\nappears in nearly every entry in the Vaughn indices:\n\n         At the time of this discussion, the Agency had not acted, and EPA was still\n         deliberating on the best Agency-wide approach for coordinating its response. The\n         author does not have decision-making authority with respect to providing the final\n         response related to PCBs. The withheld information is deliberative because EPA\n         employees and managers were still internally discussing issues concerning how to\n         best coordinate the Agency’s response, and were providing advice to the decision\n         makers.\n\nId.\n\n         As stated above, the requirement that an agency describe all withheld material “when\n\nExemption 5 is at issue is particularly acute because ‘the deliberative process privilege is so\n\ndependent upon the individual document and the role it plays in the administrative process.’”\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fAnimal Legal Def. Fund, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 299 (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 867). At\n\nthe very least, EPA is required to provide the following information for each document at issue:\n\n“(1) the nature of the specific deliberative process involved, (2) the function and significance of\n\nthe document in that process, and (3) the nature of the decisionmaking authority vested in the\n\ndocument’s author and recipient.” Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA, 960 F. Supp. 2d 101, 189\n\n(D.D.C. 2013) (citing Senate of P.R., 823 F.2d at 585–86; Arthur Andersen, 679 F.2d at 257–58;\n\nCoastal States, 617 F.2d at 867–68). EPA’s Vaughn indices, including the language quoted\n\nabove, fail to meet that burden for each of the three requirements identified above.\n\n       First, the agency is required to adequately describe the nature of the deliberative process\n\ninvolved and the function and significance of the document in that process. See Taxation with\n\nRepresentation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 678 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (requiring an agency to show\n\nthe “function and significance of the documents in the agency’s decisionmaking process”);\n\nCoastal States, 617 F.2d at 868 (“[T]he agency has the burden of establishing what deliberative\n\nprocess is involved . . . .”). Although EPA is correct that it is not required to identify a specific\n\nagency decision, see Sears, 421 U.S. at 151 n.18, it is required to show that the document was\n\n“generated as part of a definable decision-making process.” Gold Anti-Trust Action Comm., Inc.\n\nv. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 762 F. Supp. 2d 123, 135-36 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(emphasis added) (citing Petroleum Info. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 976 F.2d 1429,\n\n1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). EPA has failed to meet this burden with regard to a number of the\n\ndocuments it has withheld. PRD 954 provides a useful example. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2,\n\nat 13, ECF No. 26-2.4 The full rationale for withholding material in the document states:\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        EPA submitted its amended Vaughn indices as two separate attachments. See Notice of\nFiling Amended Vaughn Indices (attaching amended Vaughn indices as ECF Nos. 26-1 and 26-\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f       The withheld redacted email discussion reflects pre decisional deliberations\n       between EPA employees about EPA’s response to the emerging issue at the\n       beginning of EPA involvement. At the time of this discussion, the Agency had\n       not acted, and EPA was still deliberating on the best Agency-wide approach for\n       coordinating its response. The author does not have decisionmaking authority\n       with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs. The withheld\n       information is deliberative because EPA employees and managers were still\n       internally discussing issues concerning PCBs in the schools and how to best\n       coordinate the Agency’s response, and were providing advice to the decision\n       makers. The record reflects analysis, recommendations, and opinions that were\n       considered as part of the Agency’s decision making process prior to its actions\n       regarding the school. The emails do not constitute a final Agency action. Release\n       would discourage open and frank discussions among its staff about the Agency’s\n       ongoing review of issues related to its response to the PCBs at the school.\n       Release would also have a chilling effect on agency decision-making processes,\n       and on the Agency’s ability to have internal discussions and consultations\n       concerning the school. Furthermore, release would cause public confusion by\n       disclosing rationales and reasons that were not in fact ultimately the grounds for\n       EPA’s final actions. The withheld information was not circulated outside the\n       Agency.\n\nId. at 13–14.\n\n       EPA has helpfully provided separate descriptions and privilege claims for each document\n\nwithheld in full or in part, but necessary information is missing from this extended explanation.\n\nCrucially, it is not clear from this description “what deliberative process is involved.” Coastal\n\nStates, 617 F.2d at 868. Does EPA believe the deliberative process is “EPA’s response to the\n\nemerging issue?” Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 14. Or “deliberating on the best Agency-wide\n\napproach for coordinating its response?” Id. Or, discussions “prior to its actions regarding the\n\nschool?” Id. The answer is not clear. Nor is it clear that any one of these descriptions is\n\nsufficiently “definable” to allow the Court to determine whether the communications at issue\n\nwere predecisional. See Gold Anti-Trust Action Comm., 762 F. Supp. 2d at 135-36.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated language suggests that the withheld communications were considered\n\n\n\n2). For clarity, the Court refers to the separate attachments as Volume 1 (ECF No. 26-1) and\nVolume 2 (ECF No. 26-2).\n\n\n                                                14\n\f“prior to [EPA’s] actions regarding the school,” but does not specify what those actions were or\n\nwho authorized them. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 14. That context would help the Court\n\nto understand the decisions and decisionmaking processes at issue here.\n\n       The explanation provided by EPA’s declarant is no more helpful. Mr. Armann explains\n\nthat the withheld materials “pertain to myriad EPA decision-making processes.” Armann Decl.\n\n¶ 23. In fact, the three “categories” of withheld information he describes are just that—broad\n\nsubject matter categories—not decisionmaking processes related to agency action. Id.\n\n(describing communications discussing the handing of PCB issues generally in schools,\n\ncommunications discussing the specific handling of PCB issues related to the SMMUSD, and\n\nemails discussing responses to stakeholders interested or involved in issues related to the Malibu\n\nschools). Although EPA is not required to link each document to a specific action, it must do\n\nmore to tie the materials to some definable process. See Nat’l Sec. Counselors, 960 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 189 (“The individual entries in the CIA’s Vaughn index, however, do not elaborate on the\n\n‘specific deliberative process to which the withheld [document] contributed.’”) (quoting Elec.\n\nFrontier Found., 826 F. Supp. 2d at 168); Trea Senior Citizens League v. U.S. Dep’t of State,\n\n923 F. Supp. 2d 55, 68 (D.D.C. 2013) (“Such a broad and opaque description of the deliberative\n\nprocess involved does not provide the Court with enough detail about whether these documents\n\nare deliberative and predecisional.”); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 297 F. Supp.\n\n2d 252, 264 (D.D.C. 2004) (“It is not enough to say that the documents relate, in some way, to\n\n‘actions taken or proposed in response to the discovery of anthrax in the mail,’ for if they did not,\n\nthe documents would not be before the court at all.” (citations omitted)). Armed only with these\n\nvague descriptions of the deliberative process involved, the Court does not have sufficient detail\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fto determine whether the material withheld in many of the documents at issue is both\n\ndeliberative and predecisional. See Trea Senior Citizens League, 923 F. Supp. 2d at 68.\n\n       Second, for many documents withheld by EPA, the Vaughn indices fail to describe with\n\nany amount of detail the “function and significance of the document(s) in the agency’s\n\ndecisionmaking process.” Arthur Andersen, 679 F.2d at 258 (quoting Taxation with\n\nRepresentation, 646 F.2d at 678). This context is necessary for the Court to evaluate whether\n\nmaterial is predecisional, because “if documents are not a part of a clear ‘process’ leading to a\n\nfinal decision on the issue, . . . they are less likely to be properly characterized as predecisional.”\n\nCoastal States, 617 F.2d at 868. The withholding rationale for PRD 954, quoted in full above, is\n\nillustrative on this point as well. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 13–14. The closest the entry\n\ncomes to explaining the function and significance of the document is to state that the “record\n\nreflects analysis, recommendations, and opinions that were considered as part of the Agency’s\n\ndecision making process.” Id. This language appears to be repeated for every entry in the\n\nVaughn indices. A general statement of this sort is not sufficient to carry the agency’s burden to\n\nexplain the function and significance of a document in the agency’s decisionmaking process.\n\nSee Taxation with Representation, 646 F.2d at 678.\n\n       Finally, for many of the documents at issue here, EPA’s Vaughn indices and supporting\n\ndeclarations, taken as a whole, do not adequately describe the “nature of the decisionmaking\n\nauthority vested in the office or person issuing the disputed document(s), and the positions in the\n\nchain of command of the parties to the documents.” Arthur Andersen, 679 F.2d at 258 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). The D.C. Circuit has instructed that the “identity of the\n\nparties to the memorandum is important” to evaluating the withholding of material pursuant to\n\nthe deliberative process privilege, because the relative position of the author and recipient aids\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fthe court in determining whether a document is predecisional. Coastal Sates, 617 F.2d at 868.\n\nEPA’s Vaughn indices do generally reveal the author and recipient of each document, but it\n\nappears that every entry simply repeats the boilerplate statement that “the author does not have\n\ndecision-making authority with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs.” See,\n\ne.g., Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 1, at 1 (PRD 209), ECF No. 26-1; id. at 1–2 (PRD 211); id. at 3\n\n(PRD 221); see also PEER Mem. at 15; EPA Reply at 10. This vague, repeated statement fails\n\nto describe the “relative positions in the agency’s ‘chain of command’ occupied by the\n\ndocument’s author and recipient.” Senate of P.R., 823 F.2d at 586 (quoting Arthur Andersen,\n\n679 F.2d at 258).\n\n       Conclusory statements that every author does not have decisionmaking authority—\n\nwithout providing additional context, identifying the authority of the recipient, or tying the\n\nrecord to a particular decisonmaking process—do not give the Court enough information to\n\ndetermine whether the deliberative process privilege applies. The repeated assertion, which\n\nraises the question of who at EPA Region 9 does have decision-making authority, is further\n\nundermined by the Vaughn index entries related to EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator, Jared\n\nBlumenfeld. PEER points to the multiple emails that Mr. Blumenfeld sent to subordinates, and\n\nthe corresponding Vaughn indices contain the same conclusory statement that the “author does\n\nnot have decision-making authority with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs.”\n\nSee e.g., Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 1, at 22–23 (PRD 421); id. at 47–48 (PRD 1861); id. (PRD\n\n1871); Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 55 (PRD 1884); see also PEER Mem. at 16. Surprisingly,\n\nEPA has not responded to this point. Presumably, as head of EPA Region 9, Mr. Blumenfeld\n\nhad some decision-making authority, but the Vaughn indices indicate otherwise. In fact, some of\n\nthe decisions at issue in this case were made under Mr. Blumenfeld’s signature. See, e.g.,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fArmann Decl. ¶ 12 (describing EPA’s October 31, 2014 “formal approval to the District\n\ncovering certain clean-up activities”); PEER Mem. at 16 (noting that Mr. Blumenfeld signed the\n\nOctober 31, 2014 letter). Without more information regarding the “the nature of the\n\ndecisionmaking authority vested in the document’s author and recipient,” the Court is unable to\n\ndetermine whether the deliberative process privilege applies to the withheld documents. Nat’l\n\nSec. Counselors v. CIA, 960 F. Supp. 2d 101, 189 (D.D.C. 2013) (citations omitted).\n\n       Because of the inadequacy of the documentation provided by EPA in support of its\n\ndeliberative process privilege withholdings, the Court concludes “‘not that the documents are not\n\nexempt as a matter of law, but that the agency has failed to supply’ in its Vaughn submissions\n\n‘the minimal information necessary to make a determination’ concerning applicability of the\n\ndeliberative process privilege.” Elec. Frontier Found., 826 F. Supp. 2d at 173 (quoting Coastal\n\nStates, 617 F.2d at 861).5 Therefore, the Court will deny summary judgment to EPA on the issue\n\nof its withholding determinations pursuant to the deliberative process privilege.\n\n                                b. Supplemental Vaughn Indices\n\n       The Court has several options for how to proceed now that it has found EPA’s current\n\nVaughn indices are insufficient for many of the documents withheld in full or in part. Federal\n\ncourts have the authority to order agencies to produce any records that have been withheld\n\nimproperly. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); see also Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 824 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1973) (“If the factual nature of the documents were so clearly established on the record, then\n\nthe court would inquire no further and would make the legal ruling as to whether they fit within\n\n\n       5\n          Because EPA has failed to justify the withholding of many of the documents at issue,\nthe Court is unable to reach several of PEER’s other arguments, such as whether EPA has\nwithheld post-decisional material or whether EPA has withheld factual or technical material that\nis not deliberative. The Court will, however, provide additional guidance on these issues in light\nof EPA’s option to file supplemental Vaughn indices. See infra Part IV.A.2.b.\n\n\n                                                18\n\fthe defined exemption or exemptions.”). If a court finds that an “agency fails to provide a\n\nsufficiently detailed explanation to enable the district court to make a de novo determination of\n\nthe agency’s claims of exemption, the district court then has several options, including inspecting\n\nthe documents in camera, requesting further affidavits, or allowing the plaintiff discovery.” See\n\nSpirko v. U.S. Postal Serv., 147 F.3d 992, 997 (D.C. Cir. 1998). The D.C. Circuit has also\n\nexplained that “a district court should not undertake in camera review of withheld documents as\n\na substitute for requiring an agency’s explanation of its claimed exemptions.” Id. Therefore, the\n\nCourt finds that the best approach is to direct the agency to revise its Vaughn submissions,\n\naddressing the issues noted by the Court.\n\n       It may very well be the case that many of the redacted documents are covered by the\n\ndeliberative process privilege. Indeed, prior decisions have determined that the privilege protects\n\nfrom disclosure documents resembling some of the materials at issue here. See, e.g., Access\n\nReports v. Dep’t of Justice, 926 F.2d 1192, 1196–97 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (protecting memorandum\n\nwritten to prepare senior agency officials for Congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. Inst.\n\nv. EPA, 12 F. Supp. 3d 100, 120 (D.D.C. 2014) (protecting internal agency communications\n\ndiscussing “how to communicate with members of Congress . . . and how to prepare for potential\n\npoints of debate or discussion [in upcoming congressional testimony]” (citation omitted));\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 880 F. Supp. 2d 105, 111–12 (D.D.C. 2012)\n\n(protecting email exchanges discussing draft responses to press inquiries); Exxon Corp. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Energy, 585 F. Supp. 690, 698 (D.D.C. 1983) (protecting documents marked as “draft”).\n\nBut EPA must do more to show that the withholdings are proper.\n\n       PEER argues that EPA fails to demonstrate the harm that each disclosure would cause\n\nand “merely repeats the same boilerplate language” for each withholding, PEER Mem. at 17,\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\finstead of providing a “specific and detailed proof” of harm, id. (quoting Mead Data Cent., Inc.\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 258 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). Going forward, however, EPA\n\nis not prohibited from relying on repetitive language, as long as the agency describes the nature\n\nof the deliberative process involved and the function and significance of the withheld material in\n\nthat process. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (explaining\n\nthat “categorization and repetition provide efficient vehicles by which a court can review\n\nwithholdings” and that “particularity may actually impede court review and undermine the\n\nfunctions served by a Vaughn index”). PEER connects its objection to EPA’s articulation of the\n\nharm of disclosure to the agency’s failure to identify “particular actions or decisions or decision-\n\nmaking processes, which makes it impossible to identify the harm that would stem from\n\nrevealing the deliberations leading to them.” PEER Mem. at 17. Thus, to the extent EPA’s\n\nsupplemental submissions do show “(1) the nature of the specific deliberative process involved,\n\n(2) the function and significance of the document in that process, and (3) the nature of the\n\ndecisionmaking authority vested in the document’s author and recipient,” Nat’l Sec. Counselors,\n\n960 F. Supp. at 189 (citations omitted), repetitive language that logically connects disclosure\n\nwith the threat of harm may constitute the necessary “specific and detailed proof” of harm.\n\nMead Data, 566 F.2d at 258. Presumably, clarifying the nature of the deliberative process at\n\nissue in each document will also allow EPA to address PEER’s argument that EPA has withheld\n\npost-decisional documents. See PEER Mem. at 21–23; see also Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S.\n\nPostal Serv., 297 F. Supp. 2d 252, 260 (D.D.C. 2004) (“The most basic requirement of the\n\nprivilege is that a document be antecedent to the adoption of an agency policy.”).\n\n       Although the inadequacy of EPA’s current Vaughn indices prevents the Court from\n\nevaluating the particular documents, the Court briefly addresses the parties’ disagreement over\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\ftechnical data. See PEER Mem. at 18–21; EPA Reply 14–15. Generally, severable and purely\n\nfactual material should be disclosed. See Wolfe v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 839 F.2d\n\n768, 774 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc). However, factual information must also be examined “in\n\nlight of the polices and goals that underlie the deliberative process privilege” and the “context in\n\nwhich the documents were used.” Id. at 775; see also Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. U.S. Forest Serv.,\n\n861 F.2d 1114, 1119 (9th Cir. 1988) (avoiding a “semantics debate” and focusing on “the\n\nultimate objective of exemption 5” to protect the deliberative process). Thus, to the extent EPA\n\nestablishes that the privilege applies to its withholdings, the privilege may also extend to factual\n\nmatter which is used by the agency to develop policy. See, e.g., Reliant Energy Power\n\nGeneration, Inc. v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 520 F. Supp. 2d 194, 206 (D.D.C. 2007);\n\nBrannum v. Dominguez, 377 F. Supp. 2d 75, 83 (D.D.C. 2005). But the agency must specify\n\nhow the release of the purely technical data, in this particular context, would cause the type of\n\nharm the deliberative process is designed to avoid.\n\n       Finally, EPA is reminded that the D.C. Circuit has stated that, “FOIA litigants are entitled\n\nto assume that the agency’s Vaughn index is accurate in every detail” and that “[t]here is no\n\nexcuse for submitting a Vaughn index that contains errors, even minor ones.” Schiller v. NLRB,\n\n964 F.2d 1205, 1209 (D.C. Cir. 1992), abrogated on other grounds, Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 562\n\nU.S. 562 (2011).6\n\n       Some of EPA’s current Vaughn index entries do a better job of meeting the agency’s\n\nburden. For example, the rationale for withholding PRD 1986 reads, in relevant part:\n\n\n\n       6\n          The Court also notes that some of the fields in EPA’s amended Vaughn indices appear\nto be cut off by the edge of the page in certain locations. EPA should ensure that any\nsupplemental Vaughn indices are easily readable and searchable, even after being converted to\nPDF format.\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f       The withheld redacted email discussion reflects pre-decisional deliberations\n       between EPA employees and managers about EPA’s concerns regarding the\n       presence of PCBs at Malibu High School/Middle School. The withheld language\n       is from an e-mail from Tanya Mottley, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics,\n       OCSPP to Region 9 concerning the appropriate response to Cami Winikoff.\n\n       At the time of this discussion and the draft email, the Agency had not decided on\n       its position regarding the PCBs, and EPA was still deliberating on the best\n       Agency-wide approach for coordinating its response. Here, the draft email was\n       being circulated for review and comment. The author does not have decision-\n       making authority with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs.\n\nAm. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 81–82 (emphases added). This description does a far better job of\n\nidentifying a specific decisionmaking process (deciding how to respond to a request from a\n\nparticular individual) and what role the communication at issue played in that process\n\n(circulating a draft response for review and comment).7 Id.\n\n       At this time, the Court does not dictate the format of EPA’s supplemental Vaughn\n\nindices. However, if EPA provides supplemental declarations or Vaughn indices, they must\n\nshow, at the least: “(1) the nature of the specific deliberative process involved, (2) the function\n\nand significance of the document in that process, and (3) the nature of the decisionmaking\n\nauthority vested in the document’s author and recipient.” Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA, 960 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 101, 189 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing Senate of P.R., 823 F.2d at 585–86; Arthur Andersen,\n\n679 F.2d at 257–58; Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 867–68).\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         The Court also notes that this entry includes boilerplate language related to the\npurported harm of disclosure. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 82 (“Release would discourage\nopen and frank discussions . . . related to [EPA’s] response to the PCBs at the school,” “would\nalso have a chilling effect on agency decision-making processes,” and “would cause public\nconfusion . . . .”). Although the language is repetitive, it will be read in the context of EPA’s\ndescription of the role the document played in the deliberative process.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f                                   3. Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n       EPA has withheld material in a much smaller collection of documents pursuant to the\n\nattorney-client privilege. PEER challenges all of EPA’s withholdings under this privilege as\n\nwell. To the extent EPA seeks summary judgment related to communications that do not appear\n\nto include an attorney, the motion will be denied. Next the Court turns to a smaller subset of\n\ndocuments that include an attorney in some portion of the communication. Upon consideration\n\nof EPA’s Vaughn indices, Mr. Armann’s declaration, and the redacted documents presented by\n\nPEER, the Court will grant summary judgment to EPA with regard to four of the documents, but\n\ndeny EPA’s motion with regard to the remainder.\n\n       Exemption 5 extends to documents protected by the attorney-client privilege, meaning\n\nagencies are not required to disclose privileged material. “The attorney-client privilege protects\n\nconfidential communications from clients to their attorneys made for the purpose of securing\n\nlegal advice or services,” as well as “communications from attorneys to their clients if the\n\ncommunications rest on confidential information obtained from the client.” Tax Analysts v. IRS,\n\n117 F.3d 607, 618 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quotation marks and citations omitted). “In the\n\ngovernmental context, the ‘client’ may be the agency and the attorney may be an agency\n\nlawyer.” Id. Where an agency lawyer serves in a mixed capacity that involves responsibilities\n\nboth within and “outside the lawyer’s sphere,” the agency employee’s communications will only\n\nbe protected to the extent that they involve his or her professional, legal capacity. In re Sealed\n\nCase, 737 F.2d 94, 99 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The government bears the burden of proving, through\n\n“detailed and specific information,” that the withheld information falls within the attorney-client\n\nprivilege. See Campbell v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1998). For the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fgovernment to succeed on a motion for summary judgment, it must marshal its supporting\n\ndocumentation to prove:\n\n       (1) [T]he holder of the privilege is, or sought to be, a client; (2) the person to\n       whom the communication is made is a member of the bar or his subordinate and,\n       in connection with the communication at issue, is acting in his or her capacity as a\n       lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was\n       informed by his client, outside the presence of strangers, for the purpose of\n       securing legal advice; and (4) the privilege has been claimed by the client.\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 841 F. Supp. 2d 142, 153–54 (D.D.C. 2012)\n\n(citing In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98–99). Furthermore, a “fundamental prerequisite to the\n\nassertion of the privilege” is “confidentiality both at the time of the communication and\n\nmaintained since.” Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 863.\n\n       EPA has withheld 17 records pursuant to the attorney-client privilege. See EPA\n\nStatement ¶ 16–17; Armann Decl. ¶¶ 30–31; PEER Statement ¶ 6. In its motion for summary\n\njudgment, EPA argued that each of the redacted portions “contained communications between an\n\nEPA attorney and a client office relating to a legal matter, for which the client office sought legal\n\nadvice, as well as facts divulged by the client in order to obtain legal counsel.” EPA Mem. at 16.\n\nEPA relies on its declarant, Steven Armann, to support this statement. Id. Mr. Armann declares\n\nthat the 17 redacted documents “contain email conversations with [Office of Regional Counsel]\n\nand [Office of General Counsel] attorneys concerning issues related to the handling of PCBs at\n\nthe Malibu schools.” Armann Decl. ¶ 30. Mr. Armann describes two records—PRD 834 and\n\n838—in greater detail, but does not provide any additional specific description of the other 15\n\nrecords. Id. ¶ 31. PEER challenges the withholding of all 17 records, pointing to deficiencies in\n\nEPA’s Vaughn indices and arguing that “the justifications for withholding generally do not meet\n\nthe requirements of Exemption 5.” PEER Mem. at 25. PEER identifies and addresses each of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fthe 17 documents that it believes EPA is withholding pursuant to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nId. at 25–28.8\n\n           a. Withheld Records that Do Not Include an Attorney on the Communication\n\n       The Court will first turn to records withheld pursuant to the attorney-client privilege that\n\ndo not appear to include an attorney on the communication. PEER has identified 11 email\n\ncommunications withheld under the attorney-client privilege that it argues do not include any\n\nattorney: PRD 595, 597, 1037, 1340, 1346, 1473, 1443,9 1645, 1936, 1948, and 1986. Id.\n\nFollowing review of the redacted documents and their respective entries in the Vaughn indices,\n\nthe Court finds that one of the records—PRD 1645—does, in fact, appear to at least copy an\n\nattorney on the last email in the chain. See PEER Mot. Ex. 103, ECF No. 20-102. The Court\n\nagrees, however, that the remaining ten records do not include an attorney. PRD 595 provides a\n\nparticularly clear example. The relevant entry in the Vaughn index refers to “legal advice\n\nprovided by an attorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients,” see Am. Vaughn Index,\n\nvol. 1, at 34, but the redacted email chain itself contains no reference to Mr. Lieben, including in\n\nany of the “To:” or “From:” fields. See PEER Mot. Ex. 100, ECF No. 20-99. Following the\n\nCourt’s review of the ten emails in this category, none appear to include an attorney as either the\n\nauthor or recipient of the communication.\n\n       It goes without saying that the attorney-client privilege only covers “confidential\n\ncommunications between an attorney and his client.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air\n\n\n       8\n          PEER has identified the following records that it believes EPA has withheld pursuant to\nthe attorney-client privilege: PRD 538, 595, 597, 834, 838, 935, 1037, 1340, 1346, 1438, 1443,\n1473, 1575, 1645, 1936, 1948, and 1986. See PEER Mem. at 25–28. EPA has not provided its\nown list of the 17 records withheld pursuant to the attorney-client privilege nor has it objected to\nPEER’s list.\n       9\n          The amended Vaughn indices appear to remove the reference to attorney-client privilege\nin the entry for PRD 1443. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 59–60.\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fForce, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (emphasis added). The government bears the burden\n\nto prove that the “person to whom the communication is made is a member of the bar or his\n\nsubordinate and, in connection with the communication at issue, is acting in his or her capacity\n\nas a lawyer.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 841 F. Supp. 2d 142, 154\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (citing In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98–99).\n\n       Here, EPA relies only on a brief paragraph found in Mr. Armann’s Declaration that refers\n\nto the 17 records, but identifies and describes only two. See Armann Decl. ¶¶ 30–31. The\n\nentries in the Vaughn indices appear to be incorrect (as in the case of PRD 595). PEER has\n\nprovided the redacted records, which appear to show that no attorney was included on these\n\ndocuments. See PEER Mem. at 25–28. In light of this evidence, EPA has failed to carry its\n\nburden to show that the withheld communications were made to a member of the bar, acting in\n\nhis or her capacity as a lawyer. See Judicial Watch, Inc., 841 F. Supp. 2d at 154. For this\n\nreason, the Court will deny EPA’s motion for summary judgment to the extent that it seeks a\n\nruling that information has been appropriately withheld from PRD 595, 597, 1037, 1340, 1346,\n\n1473, 1443, 1936, 1948, and 1986 on the basis of the attorney client privilege.\n\n       Where the agency’s description of the records fails to establish the elements of the\n\nclaimed privilege, “the district court has the discretion to order disclosure or to afford the agency\n\nan additional opportunity to fully discharge its burden.” Id. at 155. Given the apparent problems\n\nwith the Vaughn indices and the fact that it is not entirely clear that the parties are discussing the\n\nsame documents, the Court believes affording EPA another opportunity is the most appropriate\n\noutcome. Accordingly, the Court will exercise its discretion to permit EPA a further and final\n\nopportunity to establish the applicability of the attorney-client privilege to these ten records.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f              b. Withheld Records that Include an Attorney on the Communication\n\n       The remaining seven records withheld by EPA pursuant to the attorney-client privilege\n\nappear to include an attorney as either an author or recipient of at least one link in the email\n\nchain: PRD 538, 834, 838, 935, 1438,10 1575, and 1645. PEER objects to these withholdings on\n\nseveral grounds. The Court will first address the documents that EPA has failed to show are\n\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege, before turning to the four documents that EPA has\n\nshown are privileged.\n\n       The Court first considers PRD 834 and 838, the only documents explicitly addressed in\n\nMr. Armann’s declaration. See Armann Decl. ¶ 31. PEER argues that “the actual withheld\n\ndocuments only contain communications from EPA staff, not from attorneys” and that, although\n\nMr. Lieben is on the distribution list, “there is no response from him, providing legal advice or\n\notherwise.” PEER Mem. at 25. EPA’s Vaughn index states that PRD 834 and 838, which are\n\npart of the same chain of emails, include language that “pertains to legal advice provided by an\n\nattorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients about how to proceed in regard to questions\n\nrelated to EPA’s position concerning the activities at the school.” See Vaughn Index at 216–217,\n\nECF No. 18-2.11 Mr. Armann’s declaration, however, seems to state a different rationale for the\n\nwithholding. Mr. Armann declares that the “[l]anguage redacted from [PRD 834 and 838]\n\ncontains legal advice provided by an ORC [Office of Regional Counsel] attorney to his EPA\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          The initial Vaughn index entry for PRD 1438 failed to include an explanation of the\nattorney-client privilege. See Vaughn Index at 292–93, ECF No. 18-2. The Amended Vaughn\nindices corrected this error, and explained EPA’s rationale for withholding material protected by\nthe attorney-client privilege. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2 at 59.\n       11\n         Confusingly, the Court was not able to find any reference to these two documents in\nthe amended Vaughn indices.\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fclients.”12 See Armann Decl. ¶ 31. The redacted language, however, appears in an email drafted\n\nand sent by Mr. Armann, not an attorney. See id.; see also PEER Mot. Ex. 98, ECF No. 20-97;\n\nPEER Mot. Ex. 99, ECF No. 20-98. In other words, the rationale for withholding the language\n\nseems to be that it encompasses previously provided legal advice even though it was drafted by a\n\nnon-lawyer, not that Mr. Armann was providing information for the purposes of seeking legal\n\ncounsel. If that is EPA’s argument, the agency has put forth no authority in support of its\n\nposition. The Court also notes that each of the document’s redactions are designated as\n\ndeliberative process privilege withholdings, further obscuring EPA’s rationale. In light of the\n\nconfusion created by EPA’s filings, the Court finds that the agency has not met its burden to\n\nshow that these two documents are privileged at this time. See Judicial Watch, Inc., 841 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 153–54 (citing In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98–99) (setting forth the standard for\n\nthe application of the attorney-client privilege).\n\n       Next the Court turns to PRD 1645. PEER argues that EPA withheld this document under\n\nthe attorney-client privilege despite the fact that no attorney is included on the communication.\n\nPEER Mem. at 26. In fact, the last email in the chain appears to at least copy Mr. Lieben.\n\nNevertheless, the Court finds that EPA has failed to show that this document was properly\n\nwithheld. EPA’s Vaughn index again states that the “redacted language pertains to legal advice\n\nprovided by an attorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients.” Vaughn Index at 122–123.\n\nThe document includes a series of emails, many of which are redacted in whole or in part.\n\nCrucially, however, only one of the redactions is designed as withheld under the attorney-client\n\nprivilege, and all others designations refer to the deliberative process privilege. See PEER Mot.\n\n\n\n       12\n          Mr. Armann’s declaration does not make clear whether the ORC attorney he refers to is\nalso Mr. Lieben.\n\n\n                                                     28\n\fEx. 103, ECF No. 20-102. The single redaction made under the attorney-client privilege is found\n\nin an email that was sent before Mr. Lieben was included in the communication. See id. Thus,\n\nbased on the record before the Court, it seems impossible that the language in question was\n\ncommunicated to Mr. Lieben for the purpose of seeking legal counsel. See Judicial Watch, Inc.,\n\n841 F. Supp. 2d at 153–54. Although the Court will deny EPA’s motion for summary judgment\n\nwith regard to these documents, for the reasons previously explained, see supra Part IV.A.3.a,\n\nthe Court will exercise its discretion to permit EPA a further and final opportunity to establish\n\nthe applicability of the attorney-client privilege to PRD 834, 838, and 1645.\n\n       The Court is convinced, however, that EPA properly withheld the remaining four\n\ndocuments—PRD 538, 935, 1438, and 1575—and thus grants summary judgment for EPA on\n\nthat issue. PEER makes a range of arguments in opposition to these withholdings.\n\n       For instance, PEER objects to the withholding of PRD 538 because “the email chain\n\ncontains only an email from Steve Armann, a program person, to Mr. Lieben,” an attorney.\n\nPEER Mem. at 26. PEER’s argument is misplaced. The application of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege does not turn on a formalistic rule requiring the attorney to respond to a client with\n\nlegal advice in the same series of communication. The privilege protects “confidential\n\ncommunications between an attorney and his client relating to a legal matter for which the client\n\nhas sought professional advice,” Mead Data, 566 F.2d at 252, based on the rationale that\n\nlawyers can only provide effective advocacy and advice when they are “fully informed by the\n\nclient.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). Although PEER seems to object\n\nto the withholding of email chains where an attorney is only a recipient, it has provided no\n\nauthority to support that position. While it is clear that the privilege may also protect an\n\nattorney’s communication to a client, the privilege “principally applies to facts divulged by a\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fclient to his attorney.” Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 384 F. Supp. 2d\n\n100, 114 (D.D.C. 2005). PEER appears to acknowledge this point when it argues that:\n\n       [A]lthough it is possible for a communication from the client to the attorney to be\n       privileged, this would only be the case if the communication seeks legal advice\n       and if it contains “private information concerning the agency.” EPA has provided\n       no information which could demonstrate that the withheld material meets either of\n       these requirements.\n\nPeer Mem. at 24–25 (citations omitted).\n\n       In fact, EPA has provided evidence, by declaration and in its Vaughn index, that these\n\nwithholdings meet those requirements. The Vaughn indices contain an entry for each of the\n\nremaining four documents that briefly describes the contents of the record, and states that\n\n“redacted language pertains to legal advice provided by an attorney.” See, e.g., Am. Vaughn\n\nIndex, vol. 1, at 34–35 (stating, with regard to PRD 538, that the “redacted language pertains to\n\nlegal advice provided by an attorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients about how to\n\nproceed in regard to a request for information and documents from a member of the public\n\n. . . .”). EPA’s declarant has also stated that the “redacted material in these records was kept\n\nconfidential and not transmitted to third parties.” Armann Decl. ¶ 31. The D.C. Circuit has held\n\nthat confidentiality should be inferred between an attorney and a client when the\n\ncommunications suggest that “the government is dealing with its attorneys as would any private\n\nparty seeking advice to protect personal interests.” Coastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nEnergy, 617 F.2d 854, 863 (D.C. Cir. 1980). That is the case here. Thus, upon consideration of\n\nEPA’s Vaughn indices, Mr. Armann’s declaration, and the redacted documents presented by\n\nPEER, the Court finds that EPA has shown that the attorney-client privilege applies to each of\n\nthe four documents described here. PEER also argues that certain records—specifically PRD\n\n935 and 1575—include neutral, objective analyses of agency regulations and thus are not\n\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. See PEER Mem. at 27. It is true that the D.C. Circuit\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fhas stated that “neutral, objective analyses of agency regulations” are not protected by the\n\nprivilege. Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 863. Subsequent decisions from the D.C. Circuit have\n\nemphasized, however, that the reason for that rule is to ensure the openness of an otherwise\n\nhidden body of “private law,” where a government counsel “rendering [a] legal opinion in effect\n\nis making law.” Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607, 619 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (interpreting Coastal\n\nStates). In other words, it “is this [law-making] quality, not the objective character of the legal\n\nanalyses in the documents” that is significant. Id. After considering these issues, the court\n\nconcluded that it would be inappropriate for Exemption 5 and the attorney-client privilege to “be\n\nused to protect this growing body of agency law from disclosure to the public.” Id.\n\n       That is simply not the case here. The two documents at issue contain “explanations of\n\ncertain Agency policies” (PRD 1575), and concern “legal interpretation of EPA regulations”\n\n(PRD 935), but they are not “law-making” or authoritative, nor do they contribute to a body of\n\n“secret law.” The facts being provided, and the legal advice sought, appear to relate to internal\n\ndecisionmaking regarding PCB cleanup at Malibu (PRD 935) and general policies with regard to\n\nPCBs in schools (PRD 1575), not an authoritative statement of “working law.” See Elec.\n\nFrontier Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 739 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“The OLC Opinion\n\ndoes not provide an authoritative statement of the FBI’s policy. It merely examines policy\n\noptions available to the FBI. Therefore, the OLC Opinion is not the ‘working law’ of the FBI.”).\n\n       Thus, the Court finds that EPA has met its burden of establishing the essential elements\n\nof the attorney-client privilege for these four documents. See In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98–\n\n99. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment with respect to EPA’s withholding of\n\nPRD 538, 935, 1438, and 1575 based on Exemption 5 and the attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f                                 B. Segregable Factual Material\n\n       The next issue that the Court must address is segregability. FOIA requires that “[a]ny\n\nreasonably segregable portion of a record . . . be provided to any person requesting such record\n\nafter deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). Under FOIA, “non-exempt\n\nportions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt\n\nportions.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\nAn agency is not, however, required to segregate non-exempt material if “the excision of exempt\n\ninformation would impose significant costs on the agency and produce an edited document with\n\nlittle informational value.” Neufeld v. IRS, 646 F.2d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1981), overruled on\n\nother grounds by Church of Scientology of California v. IRS, 792 F.2d 153 (D.C. Cir. 1986).\n\nThe agency is “entitled to a presumption that [it] complied with the obligation to disclose\n\nreasonably segregable material,” Hodge v. FBI, 703 F.3d 575, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2013), but that does\n\nnot excuse the agency from carrying its evidentiary burden to fully explain its decisions on\n\nsegregability. See Army Times Pub. Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 998 F.2d 1067, 1068 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n       The adequacy of an agency’s Vaughn index is a crucial factor when a district Court\n\nundertakes a segregability analysis. See, e.g., Loving v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 550 F.3d 32, 41\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (stating that “the description of the document set forth in the Vaughn index and\n\nthe agency’s declaration that it released all segregable material” are “sufficient for [the\n\nsegregability] determination”); Johnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (upholding agency’s segregation efforts based on “comprehensive Vaughn\n\nindex” and “the affidavits of [agency officials]”). Here, EPA argues that it is impossible to\n\nfurther segregate and release purely factual material from withheld documents without disclosing\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fdeliberative communications. See EPA Mem. at 16; Armann Decl. ¶ 32; EPA Reply at 18.\n\nHowever, in light of the problems with EPA’s Vaughn index identified above, the Court\n\nconcludes that, at this time, EPA’s segregability efforts do not meet the standard articulated in\n\nLoving and Johnson.\n\n                                          C. Exemption 6\n\n       Under Exemption 6, an agency may withhold “personnel and medical files and similar\n\nfiles” when the disclosure of such information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion\n\nof personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). The Supreme Court has interpreted the term\n\n“similar files” broadly so as “to cover detailed Government records on an individual which can\n\nbe identified as applying to that individual.” U.S. Dep’t of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S.\n\n595, 602 (1982) (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1497, at 11 (1966)).\n\nTherefore, not only does the exemption protect files, “but also bits of personal information, such\n\nas names and addresses, the release of which would ‘create a palpable threat to privacy.’” Prison\n\nLegal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (brackets and internal quotation\n\nmark omitted) (quoting Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). “The\n\ninformation in the file ‘need not be intimate’ for the file to satisfy the standard, and the threshold\n\nfor determining whether information applies to a particular individual is minimal.” Milton v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 783 F. Supp. 2d 55, 58 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Nat’l\n\nAeronautics & Space Admin., 920 F.2d 1002, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).\n\n       Once this threshold determination is met, a court must next ask whether disclosure would\n\ncompromise a “substantial” privacy interest, since FOIA requires the release of information “[i]f\n\nno significant privacy interest is implicated.” Multi Ag Media LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 515\n\nF.3d 1224, 1229 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\f(quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Retired Fed. Emps. v. Horner, 879 F.2d 873, 874 (D.C. Cir. 1989)). This\n\nstandard, however, “means less than it might seem,” as a substantial privacy interest is “anything\n\ngreater than a de minimis privacy interest.” Id. at 1229–30. If a substantial privacy interest\n\nexists, a court next tests whether release of such information would constitute a “clearly\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” Wash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs., 690 F.2d 252, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(6)), by balancing “the privacy interest that would be compromised by disclosure against\n\nany public interest in the requested information,” Multi Ag Media, 515 F.3d at 1228. “[T]he only\n\nrelevant public interest in the FOIA balancing analysis [is] the extent to which disclosure of the\n\ninformation sought would ‘she[d] light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties’ or\n\notherwise let citizens know ‘what their government is up to.’” Lepelletier v. FDIC, 164 F.3d 37,\n\n46 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original) (quoting U.S.\n\nDep’t of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 497 (1994)). “Information that\n\n‘reveals little or nothing about an agency’s own conduct’ does not further the statutory purpose.”\n\nBeck v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 997 F.2d 1489, 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989)).\n\n       PEER has waived its right to challenge all Exemption 6 withholdings, except for a single\n\ndocument. PEER’s only remaining Exemption 6 challenge relates to document PRD 367, which\n\nit claims “discuss[es] the activities of Hugh Kaufman, an EPA employee involved with the issues\n\nin Malibu.” PEER Statement ¶ 7; see also EPA Statement ¶ 19; Armann Decl. ¶ 33; Pl.’s\n\nStatement of Disputed Material Facts ¶ 19 (“PEER Statement of Disputed Facts”), ECF No. 20.\n\nEPA states that PRD 367 is “an e-mail between two EPA employees [c]oncerning Hugh\n\nKaufman, an EPA employee involved in actions at Malibu.” EPA Mem. at 17. According to\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fEPA, the agency “weighed the substantial privacy interest in [PRD 367] against the minimal or\n\nnon-existent public interest in disclosure,” and determined that releasing the record would be an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Id. at 18. In support of its argument, EPA relies on\n\nMr. Armann’s Declaration, which states that “[r]elease of [PRD 367] would constitute a clearly\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy and would not reveal the operations or activities of the\n\nFederal government in any meaningful way.” Armann Decl. ¶ 33. Similarly, the original\n\nVaughn indices state that “[t]here is no public interest in the individual’s personal information or\n\nother employees’ personal opinion of the employee.” Vaughn Index at 94–95.13\n\n       PEER agrees with EPA’s general characterization of PRD 367 as an email regarding Mr.\n\nKaufman, see PEER Statement ¶ 7, but it “dispute[s] that PRD 367 is properly withheld under\n\nExemption 6.” PEER Statement of Disputed Facts ¶ 19. The remainder of PEER’s briefing,\n\nhowever, including its motion and all supporting filings, never addresses the Exemption 6 issue\n\nagain. The Court found no further discussion, argument, or even mention of PRD 367 or\n\nExemption 6. Undeveloped arguments may be deemed waived. Johnson v. Panetta, 953 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 244, 250 (D.D.C. 2013) (“[I]t is not the obligation of this Court to research and\n\nconstruct the legal arguments available to the parties. To the contrary, perfunctory and\n\nundeveloped arguments, and arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority, are deemed\n\nwaived.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see also Schneider v. Kissinger, 412\n\nF.3d 190, 200 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in\n\nthe most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel’s work.”) (quoting United States v.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n         For clarity, when referring to the original Vaughn indices, the Court will use the page\nnumbers created by the Court’s electronic filing system.\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)). Thus, to the extent PEER seeks summary judgment on\n\nthe Exemption 6 issue, that portion of the motion is denied.\n\n        The Court cannot, however, grant summary judgment in favor of EPA based solely on\n\nPEER’s failure to respond to EPA’s arguments. See Grimes v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d\n\n83, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (discussing the need for the district court’s independent assessment that\n\nsummary judgment is warranted); see also id. at 97 (Griffith, J., concurring) (“[M]otions for\n\nsummary judgment may not be conceded for want of opposition. . . . The burden is always on the\n\nmovant to demonstrate why summary judgment is warranted. The nonmoving party’s failure to\n\noppose summary judgment does not shift that burden.”). Instead, the Court must rely on its\n\n“independent scrutiny” of the moving party’s evidence. Id. at 95. On the question of whether\n\nExemption 6 applies to PRD 367, the Court finds that EPA, relying on the Declaration of Steven\n\nArmann and the accompanying Vaughn indices, has borne its initial burden to demonstrate the\n\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact. EPA has presented evidence showing that PRD 367\n\nimplicates Mr. Kaufman’s privacy interest, and that the document reveals nothing of relevance\n\nabout the agency’s actions. See Armann Decl. ¶ 33; Vaugh Index at 94–95. Aside from the\n\nunsupported factual conclusion that Exemption 6 does not apply, see PEER Statement of\n\nDisputed Facts ¶ 19, PEER has done nothing to designate “specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323–24 (1986). Therefore, the\n\nCourt finds there is no genuine issue of material fact and will grant summary judgment for EPA\n\non this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f                                    V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, EPA’s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 18) is\n\nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, and PEER’s Cross-Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment (ECF No. 20) is DENIED.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiff Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (“PEER”) is a non-profit\n\norganization “dedicated to research and public education concerning the activities and operations\n\nof federal, state and local governments.” Compl. ¶ 4, ECF No. 2. In this Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) lawsuit, PEER seeks to compel the Environmental Protection Agency\n\n(“EPA”) to release records related to EPA’s involvement with the “suspected or actual toxic\n\ncontamination at schools in the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District” (“SMMUSD”).\n\nId. ¶ 5. Specifically, PEER objects to EPA’s decision to withhold or redact certain records\n\npursuant to certain FOIA exemptions.\n\f       Before the Court are EPA’s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF. No. 18) and PEER’s\n\nCross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 20). The motions are ripe and fully briefed.1\n\nUpon consideration of the parties’ submissions and the entire record, and for reasons explained\n\nbelow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part EPA’s motion for summary judgment and\n\ndeny PEER’s cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n                                     II. BACKGROUND\n\n       On August 19, 2014, PEER submitted a request for records to EPA Region 9, pursuant to\n\nFOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552. See Def.’s Statement of Material Facts (“EPA Statement”) ¶ 1, ECF No.\n\n18-1; Pl.’s Statement of Material Facts (“PEER Statement”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 20. Specifically,\n\nPEER requested:\n\n       [E]mails and other written communications and notes of all communications from\n       October 1, 2013 to the present concerning or referencing suspected or actual toxic\n       contamination with [polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”)] between named EPA\n       employees and any other EPA employees and (1) Senator Barbara Boxer, any\n       member of her staff, or the staff of the Senate Environment and Public Works\n       Committee which she chairs; (2) named members of the SMMUSD School\n       Board; (3) named members of the Malibu City Council or the City Council as a\n       group.\n\nEPA Statement ¶ 1; PEER Statement ¶ 1. PEER also sought a fee waiver, which was granted by\n\nEPA. See Decl. of Steven Armann (“Armann Decl.”) ¶ 16, ECF No. 18-3; PEER Statement ¶ 2.\n\nOn December 5, 2014, PEER brought this suit, alleging that EPA had failed to provide any\n\nrecords, as required by FOIA. See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 7. Soon after the Complaint was filed, EPA\n\nresponded to PEER’s request by releasing a group of responsive documents on December 22,\n\n2014, but withholding others pursuant to Exemptions 5 and 6 of FOIA. See Armann Decl. ¶ 17;\n\n\n       1\n        See Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“EPA Mot.”), ECF No. 18; Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF\nNo. 20; Def.’s Mem. P. & A. in Supp. Reply (“EPA Reply”), ECF No. 24; Pl.’s Reply in Supp.\nCross-Mot. Summ. J. (“PEER Reply”), ECF No. 27.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fEPA Statement ¶ 4; PEER Statement ¶ 4. Subsequent discussions between PEER and EPA led\n\nto the release of additional documents—some produced in full, and others partially redacted. See\n\nArmann Decl. ¶¶ 19–21; EPA Statement ¶¶ 5–7; PEER Statement ¶ 5. This Court ordered EPA\n\nto produce a Vaughn index providing information on redacted and fully withheld records. See\n\nMin. Order, Apr. 28, 2015. The Vaughn indices submitted with EPA’s motion for summary\n\njudgment described 451 documents withheld in part and another set of documents withheld in\n\nfull.2 See Armann Decl. ¶ 22; EPA Statement ¶ 8; PEER Statement ¶ 6. During the briefing of\n\nthese motions, EPA filed amended Vaughn indices that corrected certain errors identified by the\n\nparties and reflected EPA’s decision to release certain records that were not properly withheld.\n\nSee Notice of Filing Am. Vaughn Indices, ECF No. 26; see also Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Cross-Mot.\n\nSumm. J. (“PEER Mem.”) at 22–23, ECF No. 20 (arguing that withheld records were not intra-\n\nor inter-agency materials); Second Decl. of Steven Armann (“2d Armann Decl.”) ¶ 7, ECF No.\n\n24-1 (releasing challenged documents). Now before the Court are cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment filed by each of the parties. See generally Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“EPA Mot.”), ECF\n\nNo. 18; Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 20.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The Court’s review of the parties’ filings reveals some confusion over the number of\ndocuments withheld in full. EPA’s statement of undisputed facts refers to 2020 documents\nwithheld in full, while Mr. Armann, EPA’s declarant, refers to only 15. Compare EPA\nStatement ¶ 8 (“451 documents withheld in part and 2020 withheld in full”) with Armann Decl. ¶\n22 (“451 documents withheld in part and 15 withheld in full”). In light of EPA’s statement that\nthe agency “[i]nitially . . . identified . . . 224 documents that were withheld in full,” the 2020\nfigure appears to be an error. See EPA Statement ¶ 5. On the other hand, PEER’s statement of\nundisputed facts refers to 202 documents. See PEER Statement ¶ 6 (“451 documents withheld in\npart and 202 withheld in full”). The source of this figure is unclear.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f                                    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n                                     A.

A dispute is “genuine” if there is\n\nenough evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-movant.

P. 56(c)(1); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. In response, the non-\n\nmovant must point to specific facts in the record that reveal a genuine issue that is suitable for\n\ntrial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court must\n\n“eschew making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence,” Czekalski v.

ANALYSIS\n\n       As EPA correctly notes, PEER has made no objection to the sufficiency of EPA’s search\n\nfor responsive documents. See Def.’s Mem. P. & A. in Supp. Reply (“EPA Reply”) at 2 n.1,\n\nECF No. 24; see also Def.’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (“EPA Mem.”) at 5–7, ECF\n\nNo. 18 (arguing that EPA’s search was adequate). Similarly, EPA has not disputed PEER’s\n\nassertion that it constructively exhausted its administrative remedies, as required by FOIA. See\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fCompl. ¶ 8; see generally EPA Mot. (failing to raise issue of exhaustion); EPA Mem. (same).\n\nThe only issue before the Court is whether EPA’s decision to withhold certain documents, in\n\nwhole or in part, was appropriate.\n\n       Specifically, EPA has withheld documents pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6, and\n\nPEER argues that EPA has failed to meet its burden of proof that information has been properly\n\nwithheld under those provisions. Because of inadequacies with EPA’s Vaughn indices, the Court\n\nwill deny EPA’s motion for summary judgment with regard to the deliberative process privilege.\n\nThe Court will grant EPA’s motion for summary judgment for certain withholdings pursuant to\n\nthe attorney-client privilege, but deny the motion for documents, including all communications\n\nthat do not appear to include an attorney. Finally, the Court will grant summary judgment for\n\nEPA on the single remaining Exemption 6 withholding.\n\n                                         A. Exemption 5\n\n       EPA has withheld the vast majority of the records at issue in this case pursuant to FOIA\n\nExemption 5. Exemption 5 permits the withholding of “inter-agency or intra-agency\n\nmemorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in\n\nlitigation with the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).

The two Exemption 5 privileges at issue in this case\n\nare the deliberative process privilege and the attorney-client privilege.\n\n                                        1. Threshold Issue\n\n       As a threshold issue, Exemption 5 only covers records that are “inter-agency or intra-\n\nagency memorandums or letters.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). In other words, the Supreme Court has\n\nstated that, for Exemption 5 to apply to a document, the “source [of the withheld document] must\n\nbe a government agency.” Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S. at 8. PEER identified four withheld\n\nrecords—PRD 634, 926, 956, and 15833—that it argued are not covered by Exemption 5 because\n\nthey involve communications with outside consultants to SMMUSD. See PEER Mem. at 22–23.\n\nIn response, EPA acknowledged PEER’s argument and stated that the agency “re-examined [the]\n\nfour documents,” determined that they were “mistakenly redacted based on the belief that they\n\nwere communications with EPA consultants,” and decided to release them in full. See EPA\n\nReply at 3 n.2; see also 2d Armann Decl. ¶ 7 (describing the release of the four documents that\n\nwere mistakenly redacted). PEER has not asserted that any other documents fail to pass over the\n\nExemption 5 threshold. In light of the parties’ resolution of the threshold issue, there is no\n\ngenuine dispute that the remaining documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 5 are intra- or\n\ninter-agency records for the purposes of Section 552(b)(5). Thus, the Court can turn to the\n\nquestion of whether EPA properly withheld materials under the deliberative process and\n\nattorney-client privileges incorporated by Exemption 5.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The Court notes that the parties use both PRD and PROD as prefixes for documents at\nissue in this case. The difference is not material, but the Court will use PRD, which both parties\nuse in their later filings and which corresponds more closely to the document identifiers found in\nthe Vaughn indices.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f                                      2. Deliberative Process\n\n       EPA relies on the deliberative process privilege to justify the vast majority of its\n\nwithholdings, but PEER makes several arguments challenging that reliance. Because the Court\n\nfinds that EPA’s Vaughn indices are inadequate, it cannot reach the question of whether the\n\nmaterial has been properly withheld under the deliberative process privilege. Instead, the Court\n\nwill direct EPA to revise its Vaughn indices, taking into account the issues addressed here.\n\n       The deliberative process privilege “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\n\nrecommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental\n\ndecisions and policies are formulated.’” Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S. at 8 (quoting NLRB v.\n\nSears, Roebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109241\"><a href=\"/opinion/109241/nlrb-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (1975)). The privilege is intended “to enhance the\n\nquality of agency decisions by protecting open and frank discussion among those who make\n\nthem within the Government.” Id. at 9 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

Adequacy of the Vaughn Indices\n\n       PEER argues that (1) EPA’s declaration and Vaughn indices are inadequate because they\n\ndo not identify specific deliberative decisions or decisionmaking processes, (2) EPA’s\n\ndeclaration and Vaughn indices are inadequate because they fail to identify the nature of the\n\nauthor’s decisionmaking authority or the relative positions in the chain of command of the author\n\nand recipients, (3) the Vaughn indices are inadequate because they provide only meaningless\n\nboilerplate descriptions of the claimed harm of disclosure, (4) EPA has failed to justify its\n\nwithholding of draft documents, (5) EPA has withheld factual or technical material that is not\n\ndeliberative, (6) EPA has withheld material that is post-decisional, and (7) many entries in the\n\nVaughn indices do not correspond with the redacted documents. See PEER Mem. at 7–24. EPA\n\nresponds that PEER’s arguments “are based upon inaccurate, ill-informed, or legally incorrect\n\nconclusions.” EPA Reply at 3. EPA argues that withheld documents do not need to be limited to\n\na particular decision or policy, that duplicative justifications may be appropriate so long as\n\nfactually distinct descriptions are provided, and that EPA has appropriately withheld\n\ndeliberations related to factual and technical material. See id. at 3–15.\n\n       PEER’s primary argument—that EPA’s Vaughn indices are inadequate because they fail\n\nto tie withheld material to an agency decision or decisionmaking process—alone succeeds in\n\ndefeating summary judgment for EPA with respect to the deliberative process privilege. See\n\nPEER Mem. at 7. Several of PEER’s other arguments also stem from this basic idea. Id. at 17\n\n(“A lot of the problem with EPA’s claims about harm stems from the fact that it has not\n\nidentified particular actions or decisions or decision-making processes . . . .”). EPA counters that\n\nit has, “where possible, identified the final agency decision associated with the document; but\n\nwhere this is not possible, an agency must merely establish ‘what deliberative process is\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\finvolved, and the role played by the documents at issue in the courts of that process.’” EPA\n\nReply at 9 (citing Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866).\n\n         EPA’s statement of the law is correct. The Supreme Court has explained that “the need\n\nto protect pre-decisional documents does not mean that the existence of the privilege turns on the\n\nability of an agency to identify a specific decision in connection with which a memorandum is\n\nprepared.” NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109241\"><a href=\"/opinion/109241/nlrb-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151 n.18 (1975). The Court\n\nrecognized that some deliberate processes would not ripen into agency decisions, and did not\n\nwant to interfere with that process. See id. Instead, an agency may establish what deliberative\n\nprocess is involved, and the role that the withheld documents played in that process. See\n\nFormaldehyde Inst. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532508\"><a href=\"/opinion/532508/formaldehyde-institute-v-department-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1123 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n         The problem with EPA’s argument is not its understanding of the law, but the application\n\nof the law to this case. EPA states that each entry in its Vaughn indices “clearly states the\n\nfunction of each document, the decision at issue, and the ability of the author or the author’s\n\nauthority to make the decision.” EPA Reply at 10. As an example, EPA quotes language that\n\nappears in nearly every entry in the Vaughn indices:\n\n         At the time of this discussion, the Agency had not acted, and EPA was still\n         deliberating on the best Agency-wide approach for coordinating its response. The\n         author does not have decision-making authority with respect to providing the final\n         response related to PCBs. The withheld information is deliberative because EPA\n         employees and managers were still internally discussing issues concerning how to\n         best coordinate the Agency’s response, and were providing advice to the decision\n         makers.\n\nId.\n\n         As stated above, the requirement that an agency describe all withheld material “when\n\nExemption 5 is at issue is particularly acute because ‘the deliberative process privilege is so\n\ndependent upon the individual document and the role it plays in the administrative process.’”\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fAnimal Legal Def. Fund, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 299 (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 867). At\n\nthe very least, EPA is required to provide the following information for each document at issue:\n\n“(1) the nature of the specific deliberative process involved, (2) the function and significance of\n\nthe document in that process, and (3) the nature of the decisionmaking authority vested in the\n\ndocument’s author and recipient.” Nat’l Sec.

EPA’s Vaughn indices, including the language quoted\n\nabove, fail to meet that burden for each of the three requirements identified above.\n\n       First, the agency is required to adequately describe the nature of the deliberative process\n\ninvolved and the function and significance of the document in that process.

Vaughn Index, vol. 2,\n\nat 13, ECF No. 26-2.4 The full rationale for withholding material in the document states:\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        EPA submitted its amended Vaughn indices as two separate attachments. See Notice of\nFiling Amended Vaughn Indices (attaching amended Vaughn indices as ECF Nos. 26-1 and 26-\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f       The withheld redacted email discussion reflects pre decisional deliberations\n       between EPA employees about EPA’s response to the emerging issue at the\n       beginning of EPA involvement. At the time of this discussion, the Agency had\n       not acted, and EPA was still deliberating on the best Agency-wide approach for\n       coordinating its response. The author does not have decisionmaking authority\n       with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs. The withheld\n       information is deliberative because EPA employees and managers were still\n       internally discussing issues concerning PCBs in the schools and how to best\n       coordinate the Agency’s response, and were providing advice to the decision\n       makers. The record reflects analysis, recommendations, and opinions that were\n       considered as part of the Agency’s decision making process prior to its actions\n       regarding the school. The emails do not constitute a final Agency action. Release\n       would discourage open and frank discussions among its staff about the Agency’s\n       ongoing review of issues related to its response to the PCBs at the school.\n       Release would also have a chilling effect on agency decision-making processes,\n       and on the Agency’s ability to have internal discussions and consultations\n       concerning the school. Furthermore, release would cause public confusion by\n       disclosing rationales and reasons that were not in fact ultimately the grounds for\n       EPA’s final actions. The withheld information was not circulated outside the\n       Agency.\n\nId. at 13–14.\n\n       EPA has helpfully provided separate descriptions and privilege claims for each document\n\nwithheld in full or in part, but necessary information is missing from this extended explanation.\n\nCrucially, it is not clear from this description “what deliberative process is involved.” Coastal\n\nStates, 617 F.2d at 868. Does EPA believe the deliberative process is “EPA’s response to the\n\nemerging issue?” Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 14. Or “deliberating on the best Agency-wide\n\napproach for coordinating its response?” Id. Or, discussions “prior to its actions regarding the\n\nschool?” Id. The answer is not clear. Nor is it clear that any one of these descriptions is\n\nsufficiently “definable” to allow the Court to determine whether the communications at issue\n\nwere predecisional. See Gold Anti-Trust Action Comm., 762 F. Supp. 2d at 135-36.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated language suggests that the withheld communications were considered\n\n\n\n2). For clarity, the Court refers to the separate attachments as Volume 1 (ECF No. 26-1) and\nVolume 2 (ECF No. 26-2).\n\n\n                                                14\n\f“prior to [EPA’s] actions regarding the school,” but does not specify what those actions were or\n\nwho authorized them. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 14. That context would help the Court\n\nto understand the decisions and decisionmaking processes at issue here.\n\n       The explanation provided by EPA’s declarant is no more helpful. Mr. Armann explains\n\nthat the withheld materials “pertain to myriad EPA decision-making processes.” Armann Decl.\n\n¶ 23. In fact, the three “categories” of withheld information he describes are just that—broad\n\nsubject matter categories—not decisionmaking processes related to agency action. Id.\n\n(describing communications discussing the handing of PCB issues generally in schools,\n\ncommunications discussing the specific handling of PCB issues related to the SMMUSD, and\n\nemails discussing responses to stakeholders interested or involved in issues related to the Malibu\n\nschools). Although EPA is not required to link each document to a specific action, it must do\n\nmore to tie the materials to some definable process. See Nat’l Sec. Counselors, 960 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 189 (“The individual entries in the CIA’s Vaughn index, however, do not elaborate on the\n\n‘specific deliberative process to which the withheld [document] contributed.’”) (quoting Elec.\n\nFrontier Found., 826 F.

Armed only with these\n\nvague descriptions of the deliberative process involved, the Court does not have sufficient detail\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fto determine whether the material withheld in many of the documents at issue is both\n\ndeliberative and predecisional. See Trea Senior Citizens League, 923 F. Supp. 2d at 68.\n\n       Second, for many documents withheld by EPA, the Vaughn indices fail to describe with\n\nany amount of detail the “function and significance of the document(s) in the agency’s\n\ndecisionmaking process.” Arthur Andersen, 679 F.2d at 258 (quoting Taxation with\n\nRepresentation, 646 F.2d at 678). This context is necessary for the Court to evaluate whether\n\nmaterial is predecisional, because “if documents are not a part of a clear ‘process’ leading to a\n\nfinal decision on the issue, . . . they are less likely to be properly characterized as predecisional.”\n\nCoastal States, 617 F.2d at 868. The withholding rationale for PRD 954, quoted in full above, is\n\nillustrative on this point as well. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 13–14. The closest the entry\n\ncomes to explaining the function and significance of the document is to state that the “record\n\nreflects analysis, recommendations, and opinions that were considered as part of the Agency’s\n\ndecision making process.” Id. This language appears to be repeated for every entry in the\n\nVaughn indices. A general statement of this sort is not sufficient to carry the agency’s burden to\n\nexplain the function and significance of a document in the agency’s decisionmaking process.\n\nSee Taxation with Representation, 646 F.2d at 678.\n\n       Finally, for many of the documents at issue here, EPA’s Vaughn indices and supporting\n\ndeclarations, taken as a whole, do not adequately describe the “nature of the decisionmaking\n\nauthority vested in the office or person issuing the disputed document(s), and the positions in the\n\nchain of command of the parties to the documents.” Arthur Andersen, 679 F.2d at 258 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted). The D.C. Circuit has instructed that the “identity of the\n\nparties to the memorandum is important” to evaluating the withholding of material pursuant to\n\nthe deliberative process privilege, because the relative position of the author and recipient aids\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fthe court in determining whether a document is predecisional. Coastal Sates, 617 F.2d at 868.\n\nEPA’s Vaughn indices do generally reveal the author and recipient of each document, but it\n\nappears that every entry simply repeats the boilerplate statement that “the author does not have\n\ndecision-making authority with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs.” See,\n\ne.g., Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 1, at 1 (PRD 209), ECF No. 26-1; id. at 1–2 (PRD 211); id. at 3\n\n(PRD 221); see also PEER Mem. at 15; EPA Reply at 10. This vague, repeated statement fails\n\nto describe the “relative positions in the agency’s ‘chain of command’ occupied by the\n\ndocument’s author and recipient.” Senate of P.R., 823 F.2d at 586 (quoting Arthur Andersen,\n\n679 F.2d at 258).\n\n       Conclusory statements that every author does not have decisionmaking authority—\n\nwithout providing additional context, identifying the authority of the recipient, or tying the\n\nrecord to a particular decisonmaking process—do not give the Court enough information to\n\ndetermine whether the deliberative process privilege applies. The repeated assertion, which\n\nraises the question of who at EPA Region 9 does have decision-making authority, is further\n\nundermined by the Vaughn index entries related to EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator, Jared\n\nBlumenfeld. PEER points to the multiple emails that Mr. Blumenfeld sent to subordinates, and\n\nthe corresponding Vaughn indices contain the same conclusory statement that the “author does\n\nnot have decision-making authority with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs.”\n\nSee e.g., Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 1, at 22–23 (PRD 421); id. at 47–48 (PRD 1861); id. (PRD\n\n1871); Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 55 (PRD 1884); see also PEER Mem. at 16. Surprisingly,\n\nEPA has not responded to this point. Presumably, as head of EPA Region 9, Mr. Blumenfeld\n\nhad some decision-making authority, but the Vaughn indices indicate otherwise. In fact, some of\n\nthe decisions at issue in this case were made under Mr. Blumenfeld’s signature. See, e.g.,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fArmann Decl. ¶ 12 (describing EPA’s October 31, 2014 “formal approval to the District\n\ncovering certain clean-up activities”); PEER Mem. at 16 (noting that Mr. Blumenfeld signed the\n\nOctober 31, 2014 letter). Without more information regarding the “the nature of the\n\ndecisionmaking authority vested in the document’s author and recipient,” the Court is unable to\n\ndetermine whether the deliberative process privilege applies to the withheld documents. Nat’l\n\nSec. Counselors v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

If a court finds that an “agency fails to provide a\n\nsufficiently detailed explanation to enable the district court to make a de novo determination of\n\nthe agency’s claims of exemption, the district court then has several options, including inspecting\n\nthe documents in camera, requesting further affidavits, or allowing the plaintiff discovery.” See\n\nSpirko v.

Therefore, the\n\nCourt finds that the best approach is to direct the agency to revise its Vaughn submissions,\n\naddressing the issues noted by the Court.\n\n       It may very well be the case that many of the redacted documents are covered by the\n\ndeliberative process privilege.

PEER connects its objection to EPA’s articulation of the\n\nharm of disclosure to the agency’s failure to identify “particular actions or decisions or decision-\n\nmaking processes, which makes it impossible to identify the harm that would stem from\n\nrevealing the deliberations leading to them.” PEER Mem. at 17. Thus, to the extent EPA’s\n\nsupplemental submissions do show “(1) the nature of the specific deliberative process involved,\n\n(2) the function and significance of the document in that process, and (3) the nature of the\n\ndecisionmaking authority vested in the document’s author and recipient,” Nat’l Sec.

For example, the rationale for withholding PRD 1986 reads, in relevant part:\n\n\n\n       6\n          The Court also notes that some of the fields in EPA’s amended Vaughn indices appear\nto be cut off by the edge of the page in certain locations. EPA should ensure that any\nsupplemental Vaughn indices are easily readable and searchable, even after being converted to\nPDF format.\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f       The withheld redacted email discussion reflects pre-decisional deliberations\n       between EPA employees and managers about EPA’s concerns regarding the\n       presence of PCBs at Malibu High School/Middle School. The withheld language\n       is from an e-mail from Tanya Mottley, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics,\n       OCSPP to Region 9 concerning the appropriate response to Cami Winikoff.\n\n       At the time of this discussion and the draft email, the Agency had not decided on\n       its position regarding the PCBs, and EPA was still deliberating on the best\n       Agency-wide approach for coordinating its response. Here, the draft email was\n       being circulated for review and comment. The author does not have decision-\n       making authority with respect to providing the final response related to PCBs.\n\nAm. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 81–82 (emphases added). This description does a far better job of\n\nidentifying a specific decisionmaking process (deciding how to respond to a request from a\n\nparticular individual) and what role the communication at issue played in that process\n\n(circulating a draft response for review and comment).7 Id.\n\n       At this time, the Court does not dictate the format of EPA’s supplemental Vaughn\n\nindices. However, if EPA provides supplemental declarations or Vaughn indices, they must\n\nshow, at the least: “(1) the nature of the specific deliberative process involved, (2) the function\n\nand significance of the document in that process, and (3) the nature of the decisionmaking\n\nauthority vested in the document’s author and recipient.” Nat’l Sec.

See Am.

Although the language is repetitive, it will be read in the context of EPA’s\ndescription of the role the document played in the deliberative process.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f                                   3. Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n       EPA has withheld material in a much smaller collection of documents pursuant to the\n\nattorney-client privilege. PEER challenges all of EPA’s withholdings under this privilege as\n\nwell. To the extent EPA seeks summary judgment related to communications that do not appear\n\nto include an attorney, the motion will be denied. Next the Court turns to a smaller subset of\n\ndocuments that include an attorney in some portion of the communication. Upon consideration\n\nof EPA’s Vaughn indices, Mr. Armann’s declaration, and the redacted documents presented by\n\nPEER, the Court will grant summary judgment to EPA with regard to four of the documents, but\n\ndeny EPA’s motion with regard to the remainder.\n\n       Exemption 5 extends to documents protected by the attorney-client privilege, meaning\n\nagencies are not required to disclose privileged material. “The attorney-client privilege protects\n\nconfidential communications from clients to their attorneys made for the purpose of securing\n\nlegal advice or services,” as well as “communications from attorneys to their clients if the\n\ncommunications rest on confidential information obtained from the client.” Tax Analysts v.

See EPA\n\nStatement ¶ 16–17; Armann Decl. ¶¶ 30–31; PEER Statement ¶ 6. In its motion for summary\n\njudgment, EPA argued that each of the redacted portions “contained communications between an\n\nEPA attorney and a client office relating to a legal matter, for which the client office sought legal\n\nadvice, as well as facts divulged by the client in order to obtain legal counsel.” EPA Mem. at 16.\n\nEPA relies on its declarant, Steven Armann, to support this statement. Id. Mr. Armann declares\n\nthat the 17 redacted documents “contain email conversations with [Office of Regional Counsel]\n\nand [Office of General Counsel] attorneys concerning issues related to the handling of PCBs at\n\nthe Malibu schools.” Armann Decl. ¶ 30. Mr. Armann describes two records—PRD 834 and\n\n838—in greater detail, but does not provide any additional specific description of the other 15\n\nrecords. Id. ¶ 31. PEER challenges the withholding of all 17 records, pointing to deficiencies in\n\nEPA’s Vaughn indices and arguing that “the justifications for withholding generally do not meet\n\nthe requirements of Exemption 5.” PEER Mem. at 25. PEER identifies and addresses each of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fthe 17 documents that it believes EPA is withholding pursuant to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nId. at 25–28.8\n\n           a. Withheld Records that Do Not Include an Attorney on the Communication\n\n       The Court will first turn to records withheld pursuant to the attorney-client privilege that\n\ndo not appear to include an attorney on the communication. PEER has identified 11 email\n\ncommunications withheld under the attorney-client privilege that it argues do not include any\n\nattorney: PRD 595, 597, 1037, 1340, 1346, 1473, 1443,9 1645, 1936, 1948, and 1986. Id.\n\nFollowing review of the redacted documents and their respective entries in the Vaughn indices,\n\nthe Court finds that one of the records—PRD 1645—does, in fact, appear to at least copy an\n\nattorney on the last email in the chain. See PEER Mot. Ex. 103, ECF No. 20-102. The Court\n\nagrees, however, that the remaining ten records do not include an attorney. PRD 595 provides a\n\nparticularly clear example. The relevant entry in the Vaughn index refers to “legal advice\n\nprovided by an attorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients,” see Am. Vaughn Index,\n\nvol. 1, at 34, but the redacted email chain itself contains no reference to Mr. Lieben, including in\n\nany of the “To:” or “From:” fields. See PEER Mot. Ex. 100, ECF No. 20-99. Following the\n\nCourt’s review of the ten emails in this category, none appear to include an attorney as either the\n\nauthor or recipient of the communication.\n\n       It goes without saying that the attorney-client privilege only covers “confidential\n\ncommunications between an attorney and his client.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air\n\n\n       8\n          PEER has identified the following records that it believes EPA has withheld pursuant to\nthe attorney-client privilege: PRD 538, 595, 597, 834, 838, 935, 1037, 1340, 1346, 1438, 1443,\n1473, 1575, 1645, 1936, 1948, and 1986. See PEER Mem. at 25–28. EPA has not provided its\nown list of the 17 records withheld pursuant to the attorney-client privilege nor has it objected to\nPEER’s list.\n       9\n          The amended Vaughn indices appear to remove the reference to attorney-client privilege\nin the entry for PRD 1443. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2, at 59–60.\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fForce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350872\"><a href=\"/opinion/350872/mead-data-central-inc-v-united-states-department-of-the-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260 (D.C.

See Armann Decl. ¶¶ 30–31. The\n\nentries in the Vaughn indices appear to be incorrect (as in the case of PRD 595). PEER has\n\nprovided the redacted records, which appear to show that no attorney was included on these\n\ndocuments. See PEER Mem. at 25–28. In light of this evidence, EPA has failed to carry its\n\nburden to show that the withheld communications were made to a member of the bar, acting in\n\nhis or her capacity as a lawyer. See Judicial Watch, Inc., 841 F. Supp. 2d at 154. For this\n\nreason, the Court will deny EPA’s motion for summary judgment to the extent that it seeks a\n\nruling that information has been appropriately withheld from PRD 595, 597, 1037, 1340, 1346,\n\n1473, 1443, 1936, 1948, and 1986 on the basis of the attorney client privilege.\n\n       Where the agency’s description of the records fails to establish the elements of the\n\nclaimed privilege, “the district court has the discretion to order disclosure or to afford the agency\n\nan additional opportunity to fully discharge its burden.” Id. at 155. Given the apparent problems\n\nwith the Vaughn indices and the fact that it is not entirely clear that the parties are discussing the\n\nsame documents, the Court believes affording EPA another opportunity is the most appropriate\n\noutcome. Accordingly, the Court will exercise its discretion to permit EPA a further and final\n\nopportunity to establish the applicability of the attorney-client privilege to these ten records.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f              b. Withheld Records that Include an Attorney on the Communication\n\n       The remaining seven records withheld by EPA pursuant to the attorney-client privilege\n\nappear to include an attorney as either an author or recipient of at least one link in the email\n\nchain: PRD 538, 834, 838, 935, 1438,10 1575, and 1645. PEER objects to these withholdings on\n\nseveral grounds. The Court will first address the documents that EPA has failed to show are\n\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege, before turning to the four documents that EPA has\n\nshown are privileged.\n\n       The Court first considers PRD 834 and 838, the only documents explicitly addressed in\n\nMr. Armann’s declaration. See Armann Decl. ¶ 31. PEER argues that “the actual withheld\n\ndocuments only contain communications from EPA staff, not from attorneys” and that, although\n\nMr. Lieben is on the distribution list, “there is no response from him, providing legal advice or\n\notherwise.” PEER Mem. at 25. EPA’s Vaughn index states that PRD 834 and 838, which are\n\npart of the same chain of emails, include language that “pertains to legal advice provided by an\n\nattorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients about how to proceed in regard to questions\n\nrelated to EPA’s position concerning the activities at the school.” See Vaughn Index at 216–217,\n\nECF No. 18-2.11 Mr. Armann’s declaration, however, seems to state a different rationale for the\n\nwithholding. Mr. Armann declares that the “[l]anguage redacted from [PRD 834 and 838]\n\ncontains legal advice provided by an ORC [Office of Regional Counsel] attorney to his EPA\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          The initial Vaughn index entry for PRD 1438 failed to include an explanation of the\nattorney-client privilege. See Vaughn Index at 292–93, ECF No. 18-2. The Amended Vaughn\nindices corrected this error, and explained EPA’s rationale for withholding material protected by\nthe attorney-client privilege. See Am. Vaughn Index, vol. 2 at 59.\n       11\n         Confusingly, the Court was not able to find any reference to these two documents in\nthe amended Vaughn indices.\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fclients.”12 See Armann Decl. ¶ 31. The redacted language, however, appears in an email drafted\n\nand sent by Mr. Armann, not an attorney. See id.; see also PEER Mot. Ex. 98, ECF No. 20-97;\n\nPEER Mot. Ex. 99, ECF No. 20-98. In other words, the rationale for withholding the language\n\nseems to be that it encompasses previously provided legal advice even though it was drafted by a\n\nnon-lawyer, not that Mr. Armann was providing information for the purposes of seeking legal\n\ncounsel. If that is EPA’s argument, the agency has put forth no authority in support of its\n\nposition. The Court also notes that each of the document’s redactions are designated as\n\ndeliberative process privilege withholdings, further obscuring EPA’s rationale. In light of the\n\nconfusion created by EPA’s filings, the Court finds that the agency has not met its burden to\n\nshow that these two documents are privileged at this time. See Judicial Watch, Inc., 841 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 153–54 (citing In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98–99) (setting forth the standard for\n\nthe application of the attorney-client privilege).\n\n       Next the Court turns to PRD 1645. PEER argues that EPA withheld this document under\n\nthe attorney-client privilege despite the fact that no attorney is included on the communication.\n\nPEER Mem. at 26. In fact, the last email in the chain appears to at least copy Mr. Lieben.\n\nNevertheless, the Court finds that EPA has failed to show that this document was properly\n\nwithheld. EPA’s Vaughn index again states that the “redacted language pertains to legal advice\n\nprovided by an attorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients.” Vaughn Index at 122–123.\n\nThe document includes a series of emails, many of which are redacted in whole or in part.\n\nCrucially, however, only one of the redactions is designed as withheld under the attorney-client\n\nprivilege, and all others designations refer to the deliberative process privilege. See PEER Mot.\n\n\n\n       12\n          Mr. Armann’s declaration does not make clear whether the ORC attorney he refers to is\nalso Mr. Lieben.\n\n\n                                                     28\n\fEx. 103, ECF No. 20-102. The single redaction made under the attorney-client privilege is found\n\nin an email that was sent before Mr. Lieben was included in the communication. See id. Thus,\n\nbased on the record before the Court, it seems impossible that the language in question was\n\ncommunicated to Mr. Lieben for the purpose of seeking legal counsel. See Judicial Watch, Inc.,\n\n841 F. Supp. 2d at 153–54. Although the Court will deny EPA’s motion for summary judgment\n\nwith regard to these documents, for the reasons previously explained, see supra Part IV.A.3.a,\n\nthe Court will exercise its discretion to permit EPA a further and final opportunity to establish\n\nthe applicability of the attorney-client privilege to PRD 834, 838, and 1645.\n\n       The Court is convinced, however, that EPA properly withheld the remaining four\n\ndocuments—PRD 538, 935, 1438, and 1575—and thus grants summary judgment for EPA on\n\nthat issue. PEER makes a range of arguments in opposition to these withholdings.\n\n       For instance, PEER objects to the withholding of PRD 538 because “the email chain\n\ncontains only an email from Steve Armann, a program person, to Mr. Lieben,” an attorney.\n\nPEER Mem. at 26. PEER’s argument is misplaced. The application of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege does not turn on a formalistic rule requiring the attorney to respond to a client with\n\nlegal advice in the same series of communication. The privilege protects “confidential\n\ncommunications between an attorney and his client relating to a legal matter for which the client\n\nhas sought professional advice,” Mead Data, 566 F.2d at 252, based on the rationale that\n\nlawyers can only provide effective advocacy and advice when they are “fully informed by the\n\nclient.” Upjohn Co. v.

Although PEER seems to object\n\nto the withholding of email chains where an attorney is only a recipient, it has provided no\n\nauthority to support that position. While it is clear that the privilege may also protect an\n\nattorney’s communication to a client, the privilege “principally applies to facts divulged by a\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fclient to his attorney.” Elec.

PEER appears to acknowledge this point when it argues that:\n\n       [A]lthough it is possible for a communication from the client to the attorney to be\n       privileged, this would only be the case if the communication seeks legal advice\n       and if it contains “private information concerning the agency.” EPA has provided\n       no information which could demonstrate that the withheld material meets either of\n       these requirements.\n\nPeer Mem. at 24–25 (citations omitted).\n\n       In fact, EPA has provided evidence, by declaration and in its Vaughn index, that these\n\nwithholdings meet those requirements. The Vaughn indices contain an entry for each of the\n\nremaining four documents that briefly describes the contents of the record, and states that\n\n“redacted language pertains to legal advice provided by an attorney.” See, e.g., Am. Vaughn\n\nIndex, vol. 1, at 34–35 (stating, with regard to PRD 538, that the “redacted language pertains to\n\nlegal advice provided by an attorney, Ivan Lieben, to his EPA program clients about how to\n\nproceed in regard to a request for information and documents from a member of the public\n\n. . . .”). EPA’s declarant has also stated that the “redacted material in these records was kept\n\nconfidential and not transmitted to third parties.” Armann Decl. ¶ 31. The D.C. Circuit has held\n\nthat confidentiality should be inferred between an attorney and a client when the\n\ncommunications suggest that “the government is dealing with its attorneys as would any private\n\nparty seeking advice to protect personal interests.” Coastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nEnergy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375896\"><a href=\"/opinion/375896/coastal-states-gas-corporation-v-department-of-energy/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 863 (D.C. Cir. 1980). That is the case here. Thus, upon consideration of\n\nEPA’s Vaughn indices, Mr. Armann’s declaration, and the redacted documents presented by\n\nPEER, the Court finds that EPA has shown that the attorney-client privilege applies to each of\n\nthe four documents described here. PEER also argues that certain records—specifically PRD\n\n935 and 1575—include neutral, objective analyses of agency regulations and thus are not\n\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. See PEER Mem. at 27. It is true that the D.C. Circuit\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fhas stated that “neutral, objective analyses of agency regulations” are not protected by the\n\nprivilege. Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 863. Subsequent decisions from the D.C. Circuit have\n\nemphasized, however, that the reason for that rule is to ensure the openness of an otherwise\n\nhidden body of “private law,” where a government counsel “rendering [a] legal opinion in effect\n\nis making law.” Tax Analysts v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743062\"><a href=\"/opinion/743062/tax-analysts-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (interpreting Coastal\n\nStates). In other words, it “is this [law-making] quality, not the objective character of the legal\n\nanalyses in the documents” that is significant. Id. After considering these issues, the court\n\nconcluded that it would be inappropriate for Exemption 5 and the attorney-client privilege to “be\n\nused to protect this growing body of agency law from disclosure to the public.” Id.\n\n       That is simply not the case here. The two documents at issue contain “explanations of\n\ncertain Agency policies” (PRD 1575), and concern “legal interpretation of EPA regulations”\n\n(PRD 935), but they are not “law-making” or authoritative, nor do they contribute to a body of\n\n“secret law.” The facts being provided, and the legal advice sought, appear to relate to internal\n\ndecisionmaking regarding PCB cleanup at Malibu (PRD 935) and general policies with regard to\n\nPCBs in schools (PRD 1575), not an authoritative statement of “working law.” See Elec.\n\nFrontier Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (D.C.

Therefore, the OLC Opinion is not the ‘working law’ of the FBI.”).\n\n       Thus, the Court finds that EPA has met its burden of establishing the essential elements\n\nof the attorney-client privilege for these four documents. See In re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d at 98–\n\n99. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment with respect to EPA’s withholding of\n\nPRD 538, 935, 1438, and 1575 based on Exemption 5 and the attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f                                 B. Segregable Factual Material\n\n       The next issue that the Court must address is segregability. FOIA requires that “[a]ny\n\nreasonably segregable portion of a record . . . be provided to any person requesting such record\n\nafter deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). Under FOIA, “non-exempt\n\nportions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt\n\nportions.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.

Cir. 1977).\n\nAn agency is not, however, required to segregate non-exempt material if “the excision of exempt\n\ninformation would impose significant costs on the agency and produce an edited document with\n\nlittle informational value.” Neufeld v.

U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611560\"><a href=\"/opinion/611560/the-army-times-publishing-company-v-department-of-the-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1068 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n       The adequacy of an agency’s Vaughn index is a crucial factor when a district Court\n\nundertakes a segregability analysis. See, e.g., Loving v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187269\"><a href=\"/opinion/187269/loving-v-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (stating that “the description of the document set forth in the Vaughn index and\n\nthe agency’s declaration that it released all segregable material” are “sufficient for [the\n\nsegregability] determination”); Johnson v.

Cir. 2002) (upholding agency’s segregation efforts based on “comprehensive Vaughn\n\nindex” and “the affidavits of [agency officials]”). Here, EPA argues that it is impossible to\n\nfurther segregate and release purely factual material from withheld documents without disclosing\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\fdeliberative communications. See EPA Mem. at 16; Armann Decl. ¶ 32; EPA Reply at 18.\n\nHowever, in light of the problems with EPA’s Vaughn index identified above, the Court\n\nconcludes that, at this time, EPA’s segregability efforts do not meet the standard articulated in\n\nLoving and Johnson.\n\n                                          C. Exemption 6\n\n       Under Exemption 6, an agency may withhold “personnel and medical files and similar\n\nfiles” when the disclosure of such information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion\n\nof personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). The Supreme Court has interpreted the term\n\n“similar files” broadly so as “to cover detailed Government records on an individual which can\n\nbe identified as applying to that individual.” U.S. Dep’t of State v.

According to\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fEPA, the agency “weighed the substantial privacy interest in [PRD 367] against the minimal or\n\nnon-existent public interest in disclosure,” and determined that releasing the record would be an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Id. at 18. In support of its argument, EPA relies on\n\nMr. Armann’s Declaration, which states that “[r]elease of [PRD 367] would constitute a clearly\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy and would not reveal the operations or activities of the\n\nFederal government in any meaningful way.” Armann Decl. ¶ 33. Similarly, the original\n\nVaughn indices state that “[t]here is no public interest in the individual’s personal information or\n\nother employees’ personal opinion of the employee.” Vaughn Index at 94–95.13\n\n       PEER agrees with EPA’s general characterization of PRD 367 as an email regarding Mr.\n\nKaufman, see PEER Statement ¶ 7, but it “dispute[s] that PRD 367 is properly withheld under\n\nExemption 6.” PEER Statement of Disputed Facts ¶ 19. The remainder of PEER’s briefing,\n\nhowever, including its motion and all supporting filings, never addresses the Exemption 6 issue\n\nagain.
