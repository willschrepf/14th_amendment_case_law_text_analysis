Klumper,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          May 13, 2013\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Appellant José Manuel Zavala-Martí\n\n(\"Zavala\") challenges the life sentence he received for his role in\n\na large-scale drug operation that sold heroin, crack, cocaine, and\n\nmarijuana at a public housing project in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. The\n\nsecond of forty-seven defendants charged in a ten-count superseding\n\nindictment, Zavala pled guilty at the end of the first day of\n\ntestimony.    He identifies four substantial procedural flaws in his\n\nsentencing: (1) the imposition of a general sentence of life\n\nimprisonment on all counts when none of the crimes of conviction\n\nsupported    that   penalty;   (2)   the    court's       reliance   on   adverse\n\ninformation it received ex parte; (3) the court's failure to\n\nexplain why it chose the highest point in the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrange; and (4) the court's silence on his disparity argument.                  We\n\nneed reach only the first of these asserted problems to conclude\n\nthat resentencing is necessary.         In light of the resentencing, we\n\nalso find it advisable to address the ex parte issue.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n            We sketch here the factual and procedural background of\n\nthis case, describing only briefly the underlying drug conspiracy\n\nwhile recounting in more detail the sentencing proceedings that are\n\nat issue on appeal.\n\nA. The Drug Trafficking Conspiracy\n\n            From at least 2004 through early 2008, Cruz Roberto\n\nRamos-Gonzalez      (\"Belleza\")   was      running    a    multi-faceted     drug\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdistribution operation at the Victor Berríos Public Housing Project\n\nin Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as well as in several other locations.1\n\nAppellant Zavala was a high-level participant in the enterprise,\n\ndescribed by one co-defendant as Belleza's \"right-hand man\" and by\n\nanother as one of several \"lieutenants\" in the organization.\n\nAppellant    and   several      other       co-conspirators     served     as\n\n\"administrators\" of the drug points and were responsible, inter\n\nalia, for enforcing discipline and recruiting other participants.\n\nDuring the two years that appellant participated in the conspiracy,\n\nfrom 2005-2007,    the    organization    distributed   about   twenty-two\n\nkilograms of cocaine, among other drugs.\n\n            In August 2007, a federal grand jury returned a seven-\n\ncount indictment charging forty-four defendants with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute   heroin,     cocaine,   crack    cocaine,   and   marijuana.\n\nAppellant was named in all seven counts and surrendered to federal\n\nagents on October 16, 2007.         While in prison awaiting trial,\n\nappellant and several co-defendants sought to induce a cooperating\n\nco-defendant, Harry Smith Delgado-Cañuelas (\"Delgado\"), to recant\n\ntestimony he had given to the grand jury.         Appellant arranged for\n\nmore than $5,000 to be wired to Delgado, some deposited directly\n\ninto his prison commissary account and some delivered through third\n\nparties, in exchange for Delgado's signing and tape-recording false\n\n\n     1\n       We draw the facts from the trial transcript, appellant's\nadmissions at his change-of-plea hearing, his presentence\ninvestigation report (\"PSR\"), and his sentencing hearing.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fstatements about the conspiracy. Appellant also allegedly arranged\n\nto have a cell phone smuggled to Delgado in the prison so Delgado\n\ncould receive a call from Belleza, who was at that time a fugitive.\n\n            A ten-count superseding indictment was issued in early\n\n2008.      Appellant       was   listed    as    the     second    of     forty-seven\n\nindividuals    and    again      was   charged     in    all    counts.          Briefly\n\ndescribed, the indictment alleged a conspiracy, facilitated by the\n\nuse of firearms, to distribute various quantities of the drugs\n\nidentified    above    near      a   public     school    and     housing    project,\n\ndistribution of each of the narcotics, witness tampering, and\n\nbribery.     The three witness tampering and bribery charges were\n\nsevered from the others, and trial on the remaining seven counts\n\nbegan on October 13, 2009 for appellant and five co-defendants.\n\nAfter a two-day jury selection process and one day of testimony,\n\nappellant pled guilty, without a plea agreement, to all ten counts\n\nof the superseding indictment.\n\nB. The Charges\n\n            As the counts are central to the sentencing issues that\n\nare the basis for this appeal, we describe each of them: (i)\n\nconspiring to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, 500\n\ngrams or more of cocaine, 100 grams or more of heroin, and a\n\nmeasurable amount of marijuana within 1,000 feet of a public\n\nhousing project       or    public     school,   in     violation    of     21    U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 846 and 860 (Count One); (ii) conspiring to possess\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\ffirearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) and (o) (Count Two); (iii) aiding and\n\nabetting the distribution of 100 grams or more of heroin within\n\n1,000 feet of a public housing project or public school, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 860 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count\n\nThree); (iv) aiding and abetting in the distribution of fifty grams\n\nor more of cocaine base (\"crack\"), 500 grams or more of cocaine,\n\nand a measurable amount of marijuana within 1,000 feet of a public\n\nhousing project       or   public   school,   in   violation   of    21   U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 860 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Counts Four, Five, and Six);\n\n(v) conspiring to tamper with a government witness, and aiding and\n\nabetting in government witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1512(b)(1), (k), and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Counts Seven and Eight); (vi)\n\naiding and abetting in the bribery of a government witness, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(3) and 2 (Count Nine); and (vii)\n\nforfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853 and Rule 32.2(a) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Count Ten).\n\nC. Sentencing\n\n           In   his    Sentencing    Memorandum,     appellant      proposed   a\n\nsentence   of   no    more   than   twelve    years'   imprisonment.        The\n\ngovernment responded with a recommended sentence of life in prison.\n\nThe wide discrepancy was attributable to, inter alia, the parties'\n\ndiffering assessments of appellant's role in the offense, the drug\n\nquantity for which he should be held responsible, and the need to\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\favoid sentencing disparity.      Appellant also argued that he should\n\nbe sentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\"FSA\"), which\n\nreduced the maximum statutory penalty for distributing the amount\n\nof crack cocaine alleged in the indictment (fifty grams) from life\n\nin prison to forty years.         See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii)\n\n(2009); id. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2011).         In addition, he sought\n\nleniency   based   on   his   personal   circumstances,   including   his\n\naddiction to alcohol and abuse of prescribed medications.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, appellant's counsel reiterated\n\nthe request for a sentence of twelve years, emphasizing appellant's\n\ndownward spiral following the tragic death of his brother and his\n\nsusceptibility at that time to Belleza's bad influence.        Evidence\n\npresented to the court showed that appellant had lived a stable,\n\nproductive life until his younger brother's murder when appellant\n\nwas in his early twenties.2         Appellant's common-law wife, the\n\nmother of his two sons, stated that \"everything changed\" after the\n\nbrother's murder, which remains an unsolved crime.          Appellant's\n\nfather reported that his son became \"unstable,\" explaining that he\n\ndrank too much, became addicted to a prescription drug, and started\n\nto associate with the wrong crowd.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       On the day before appellant's sentencing hearing, his\ncounsel submitted a DVD containing video statements from family\nmembers, including his parents, brother, and sister. The record\ncontains a transcript of the statements that was prepared by a\ncertified court reporter.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            Counsel   also     emphasized       that   similarly      situated\n\ndefendants in other cases had been offered sentences comparable to\n\nappellant's proposed twelve-year term.          She further noted that the\n\ngovernment had previously offered to recommend a seventeen-year\n\nsentence in exchange for a guilty plea.          Though appellant rejected\n\nthat deal, counsel argued that a life sentence was not justified\n\nbecause \"[t]he evidence remains the same.\"\n\n            The   prosecutor   likewise    renewed     at   the   hearing   the\n\ngovernment's request for a life sentence, explaining that even a\n\n\"conservative\" approach to the drug calculation -- considering only\n\nthe amount of cocaine and not any other drug -- generated a\n\nguidelines range of 360 months to life.            In response to defense\n\ncounsel's    disparity    argument,       the    prosecutor       argued    that\n\nappellant's situation differed from that of the individuals cited\n\nfor comparison because, unlike them, appellant had not entered into\n\na plea agreement. The prosecutor emphasized appellant's leadership\n\nactivities in the conspiracy, as well as his key role in the effort\n\nto procure false testimony from Delgado.\n\n            The prosecutor also brought up an incident involving\n\nappellant that occurred at the prison during his incarceration,\n\nseparate from the witness tampering activity and after he had been\n\ncharged in the superseding indictment.           Along with two other men\n\n(one co-defendant and an unidentified third person), appellant\n\nentered an interview room where a probation officer was meeting\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fwith another co-defendant and his attorney and demanded to see the\n\nco-defendant's plea agreement.         According to the government, the\n\nprobation officer and attorney were intimidated by the encounter.\n\n           Asserting that appellant had \"not shown that anything\n\nthat has happened to him from all these years will deter him from\n\nconducting future criminal acts,\" the government predicted his\n\nlikelihood   of    rehabilitation    at    \"zero   to    none.\"       Hence,    it\n\nrecommended the highest guidelines sentence.\n\n           Defense counsel responded by again raising the disparity\n\nargument, noting, inter alia, that the court had imposed that day\n\na twenty-year term on a similarly situated co-defendant (Defendant\n\nNo. 4 in the indictment).        Counsel also reported that the attorney\n\ninvolved in the prison episode cited by the government had told her\n\n-- contrary to the government's representation -- that he had not\n\nfelt intimidated.      Finally, she emphasized that appellant had in\n\nfact shown a capacity for rehabilitation in the previous twelve to\n\nfourteen months and had broken ties to his criminal associates.\n\n           In     imposing   sentence,     the   district     court    accepted\n\nappellant's contention that he participated in the conspiracy for\n\nonly   twenty-four     months.      Accordingly,        the   court   held     him\n\naccountable for the distribution of about twenty-two kilograms of\n\ncocaine. The court stated that it \"took under advisement the issue\n\nof the amendments to the Fair Sentencing Act,\" and explained that\n\nit was \"not in any way calculating any base offense level based on\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fany crack cocaine.\"     The court thus adopted appellant's proposed\n\nstarting base offense level (\"BOL\") of 34. It increased the BOL by\n\ntwo levels because the drug dealing occurred near a protected\n\nlocation, see U.S.S.G. § 2D1.2(a)(1), added another two levels for\n\nthe possession of firearms, see id. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and two more for\n\nobstruction of justice, see id. § 3C1.1.          The court rejected\n\nappellant's contention that he should be treated as a supervisor of\n\nthe drug organization, rather than a leader, and thus added four\n\nlevels   for   appellant's     role    in   the    offense.      See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a).3   Finally, the court granted appellant a two-\n\nlevel downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.      See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a).    The resulting BOL was 42, and the applicable\n\ncriminal history category was I.       As a result, the sentencing\n\nguidelines range was 360 months to life imprisonment.\n\n          The district court prefaced its sentencing pronouncement\n\nwith a summary of appellant's criminal conduct, including his\n\nposition as \"the second in command of one of the most dangerous\n\ndrug trafficking organizations operating in the eastern part of\n\nPuerto Rico,\" his \"principal role in the efforts to get the\n\n\n     3\n        At appellant's change-of-plea hearing, the court had\ndescribed appellant's role in the conspiracy as a \"supervisor.\"\nThe prosecutor stated at that hearing that appellant was a\nsupervisor of five or more people and that he \"acted as the\nlieutenant of the place on behalf of the drug trafficking\norganization.\"   Under the guidelines, a supervisory role would\nresult in a three-level increase in the BOL rather than the four-\nlevel adjustment for a leadership role. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fGovernment's main cooperator to recant his testimony,\" and his\n\n\"instrumental\" role in smuggling the cell phone to Delgado.   The\n\ncourt also cited the episode at the prison involving the probation\n\ninterview:\n\n                 The Court has also received information\n          from the probation office that this defendant\n          along with another co-defendant also attempted\n          to intimidate another U.S. probation officer,\n          who was at the time conducting the presentence\n          interview of a co-defendant in this instant\n          case at MDC Guaynabo.\n\n                 The defendant interrupted the interview\n          and demanded to see the co-defendant's Plea\n          Agreement, which is confidential and against\n          Bureau of Prisons' rules and regulations, all\n          to verify if said co-defendant was cooperating\n          with the Government.\n\n          . . .\n\n                  Although   Counsel   says   that   she\n          interviewed the lawyer involved in the issue\n          with the probation officer, as a result of\n          that incident, it was brought to the attention\n          of the Court. We held a meeting with all the\n          judges present, probation office, where the\n          probation officer who was involved, certainly\n          related    to  the Court    the   events  that\n          transpired and how she was intimidated at the\n          time she was interviewing another co-defendant\n          who had pled guilty.\n\n                 Mr. Zavala was accompanied by another\n          co-defendant and another person who was not\n          identified. And he was the main actor of that\n          incident.    It shows that he was still\n          exercising his position as leader of the drug\n          trafficking organization, at least of those\n          that were in prison.\n\n                 So in order to reflect the seriousness\n          of the offense, to promote respect for the law\n          and to provide just punishment for the\n\n                              -10-\n\f           offense, it is the judgment of this Court the\n           defendant is hereby committed to the custody\n           of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for\n           the remainder of his natural life.\n\n           Immediately following the imposition of sentence, defense\n\ncounsel, noting the court's reliance on the ex parte meeting with\n\nthe probation officer, asked the court to vacate the sentence so\n\nthat she could review any written reports or videotapes of that\n\nmeeting.   The judge responded that there was no memorialization of\n\nthe meeting: \"It was just a sit down with the probation officer and\n\nthat was it.    We were given information as to what transpired at\n\nthat time.\"    Counsel's ensuing request for an opportunity to call\n\nthe probation officer to the stand was denied.\n\n           Near the close of the proceeding, the prosecutor sought\n\nto clarify the court's reference to the incident:\n\n           Prosecutor: Counsel . . . [said] that Your\n           Honor expressly used the incident with the\n           probation officer . . . to make a judgment of\n           life imprisonment. And I just want to clarify\n           for the record, that wasn't the only factor,\n           the expressed factor for Your Honor's basis.\n\n                  Court: No, no. I expressed it. And if\n           you notice that when the latter part of that\n           statement I said that that shows that he was\n           still exercising his position as leadership\n           while in prison over the other co-defendants\n           in this case that were in prison.\n                  That's the only reason I brought it\n           forth, to show that he was still a[]head of\n           that group and he was still exercising [a]\n           leadership role.\n\n                   Prosecutor: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f                 Court: That's the only reason I brought\n          it up, because I know it doesn't influence the\n          sentence.\n\n          The court did not announce a sentence on each count\n\nseparately, and its subsequent written judgment also recorded the\n\nsentence of \"[i]mprisonment for the remainder of his natural life\"\n\nwithout linking it to individual counts.4   The forfeiture count,\n\nCount Ten, was dismissed.5   A section of the court's Statement of\n\nReasons filed as part of the judgment, titled \"Additional Facts\n\nJustifying the Sentence in this Case,\" stated, in part: \"The Court\n\nalso received information that defendant along with another co-\n\ndefendant also attempted to intim[id]ate another U.S. Probation\n\n\n\n     4\n       The same language appeared in an amended judgment, which\nadded (at appellant's request) to the list of institutions the\ncourt recommended to the Bureau of Prisons for appellant's\nplacement.\n     5\n       The Docket entries for the documents titled \"Judgment in a\nCriminal Case\" (No. 2579) and \"Amended Judgment in a Criminal Case\"\n(No. 2788) do list each count separately and in sequence, grouping\nthe counts with identical supervised release terms and monetary\nassessments. Counts Three to Six, for example, are recorded as\nfollows:\n\n     Count(s) 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, Impr for the remainder of his\n     natural life. SRT of 10 years. SMA of $100.00[.]\n\nAt both the sentencing hearing and in the Judgments themselves,\nhowever, the court imposed an undifferentiated life term.       The\nclerk's entry cannot add substantively to the court's judgment, and\nthe government does not argue otherwise. See generally Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 32(k)(1) (\"In the judgment of conviction, the court must\nset forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court's findings, the\nadjudication, and the sentence. . . .     The judge must sign the\njudgment, and the clerk must enter it.\").\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fOfficer, who was at the time conducting the pre-sentence interview\n\nof a co-defendant in this case at MDC-Guaynabo.\"\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Appellant attacks his life sentence on four fronts.\n\nFirst, he claims it is impermissible to impose a general sentence\n\nrather than giving specific attention to each separate count, and\n\nthe general sentence is additionally improper here because none of\n\nthe counts authorizes a term of life imprisonment.                      Second, he\n\nargues    that    the    court    committed      a   due   process   violation   by\n\nimproperly relying on adverse factual information obtained in the\n\nex parte meeting with the probation officer.                    Third, appellant\n\nasserts that the court erred by failing to explain why it chose to\n\nsentence him at the specific point within the guidelines range, as\n\nrequired by statute when the range spans more than twenty-four\n\nmonths.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1).               Finally, he argues that the\n\ncourt erred       by    giving    no   reason    for   rejecting     his disparity\n\nargument.     As noted above, we reach only the first two of these\n\ncontentions.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n            Claims of sentencing error trigger a two-step inquiry:\n\n\"we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally\n\nreasonable       and    then     determine      whether    it   is   substantively\n\nreasonable.\"       United States v. Clogston, 662 F.3d 588, 590 (1st\n\nCir. 2011).      In evaluating the procedures used, \"we review factual\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\ffindings for clear error, arguments that the sentencing court erred\n\nin interpreting or applying the guidelines de novo, and judgment\n\ncalls for abuse of discretion.\"             United States v. Leahy, 668 F.3d\n\n18, 21 (1st Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).                        The substantive\n\nreasonableness of the sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion,\n\ntaking into account the totality of the circumstances.                     Id. at 24.\n\n               Although   appellant       argues    that   a     sentence    of    life\n\nimprisonment is unreasonably harsh, his claims are procedural in\n\nnature.    Our review thus adheres to the formula set out above for\n\nprocedural challenges, modified as appropriate for issues subject\n\nto the plain error standard.                See United States v. Fernández-\n\nHernández, 652 F.3d 56, 71 (1st Cir. 2011) (\"'[W]hen a defendant\n\nfails to preserve an objection below, the plain error standard\n\nsupplants the customary standard of review.'\" (quoting United\n\nStates    v.    Dávila-González,      595    F.3d    42,   47     (1st    Cir.    2010)\n\n(alteration in original)).\n\nB. The General Sentence of Life Imprisonment\n\n               The government concedes that the imposition of a general\n\nsentence of life imprisonment was improper, as no count in the\n\nindictment       supported   such     a    sentence,6      and    it     agrees    that\n\n\n     6\n       The government asserts in its brief that a general sentence\nis not per se unlawful when the term imposed does not exceed the\nmaximum for one or more counts.      The defendant argues that a\ngeneral sentence is improper regardless of its propriety for\ndiscrete counts. We need not enter that debate, as the government\nconcedes that the life sentence imposed here was not authorized for\nany of the nine counts.\n\n                                          -14-\n\fresentencing is necessary on most of the counts.7       It argues,\n\nhowever, that the life term should stand on two of the drug counts\n\n-- Counts One and Five -- because appellant cannot satisfy the\n\nplain error standard with respect to those two counts.      Before\n\nexamining the competing views of the appropriate remedy for the\n\nacknowledged error, we briefly digress to explain the FSA's effect\n\non the case.\n\n          1. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\n\n          In Count One of the indictment, appellant was charged\n\nwith conspiring to possess for distribution 50 grams or more of\n\ncrack, along with varying quantities of other drugs.    Count Four\n\nalleged that he in fact possessed, with the intent to distribute,\n\n\n\n     We note, however, that we have stated that \"[t]he proper\nprocedure\" is to \"render a separate sentence on each count.\" See\nUnited States v. Moynagh, 566 F.2d 799, 805 (1st Cir. 1977),\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. Nieves-Burgos, 62\nF.3d 431, 436 (1st Cir. 1995).         Some courts have adopted\nappellant's view, at least in particular cases. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Ward, 626 F.3d 179, 184-85 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding plain\nerror and remanding for resentencing where general sentence\nexceeded the mandatory maximum on some counts); United States v.\nMoriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1025 (11th Cir. 2005) (remanding for\nresentencing where general sentence exceeded the mandatory maximum\non one count because \"[i]t is difficult to determine the intention\nof the district court\").\n     7\n       The government agrees that resentencing is necessary on\nCount Two (twenty-year statutory maximum), Counts Three & Four\n(eighty-year statutory maximum), Count Six (forty-year statutory\nmaximum), Counts Seven & Eight (twenty-year statutory maximum), and\nCount Nine (fifteen-year statutory maximum).          Although the\ngovernment's brief asserted that resentencing on Count Seven was\nunnecessary, the government acknowledged at oral argument that it\nhad erred in so arguing.\n\n                               -15-\n\f50 grams or more of crack.               At the time the indictment was filed,\n\na defendant convicted of a distribution offense involving 50 grams\n\nor more of crack was exposed to a maximum statutory term of life\n\nimprisonment.            By the time appellant was sentenced, however, the\n\nFSA had reduced the maximum penalty for that amount of crack to 40\n\nyears, and it increased the trigger amount for a life sentence to\n\n280   grams        or    more.         See   21    U.S.C.    §    841   (b)(1)(B)(iii),\n\n(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n\n              As described above, appellant argued in his sentencing\n\nmemorandum that he was entitled to be sentenced under the FSA, with\n\nits reduced penalty for the charged amount of crack.                        The Supreme\n\nCourt   recently             agreed,   holding     that     FSA   penalties    apply    to\n\noffenders, such as appellant, who were sentenced after the statute\n\nwent into effect.               See Dorsey v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2321,\n\n2335-36 (2012).              Hence, at the time of appellant's sentencing, the\n\ncrack cocaine averments in the indictment supported a maximum\n\nsentence of forty years, doubled to eighty years because the drug\n\ndealing took place in proximity to a school and public housing\n\nproject.      See 21 U.S.C. § 860(a).\n\n              As        it    turned    out,      the   district    court     explicitly\n\ndisclaimed reliance on any amount of crack cocaine in imposing\n\nsentence and \"took under advisement\" the impact of the FSA.                            The\n\ngovernment did not object to the court's approach. We thus proceed\n\n\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\fwith our analysis without taking into account the crack cocaine\n\nallegations.\n\n           2. Plain Error\n\n           Where a defendant fails to present a claim of error to\n\nthe district court, as is the case with appellant's challenge to\n\nthe general life term, he must satisfy a demanding four-prong\n\ninquiry to obtain relief.     To demonstrate reversible plain error,\n\na defendant must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was\n\nclear and obvious, and it not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights but also (4) \"'impaired the fairness, integrity,\n\nor public reputation of the judicial proceedings.'\"        United States\n\nv. Mitrano, 658 F.3d 117, 124 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting United\n\nStates v. González-Castillo, 562 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir. 2009)). The\n\ngovernment asserts that, even if appellant can satisfy the first\n\nthree requirements with respect to Counts One and Five, he cannot\n\nsatisfy the fourth prong.\n\n           As we have described, Count One alleges that appellant\n\nconspired to distribute fifty or more grams of cocaine base, 500\n\ngrams or more of cocaine, 100 grams or more            of heroin, and\n\nmeasurable amounts of marijuana, all within 1,000 feet of a public\n\nhousing   project   or   public   school.   Count   Five   alleges   that\n\nappellant aided and abetted in the distribution of 500 grams or\n\nmore of cocaine, also within 1,000 feet of a housing project or\n\npublic school.      The statutory maximum penalty for the crimes\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\falleged in the two counts, which is linked to drug quantities, is\n\neighty years.   See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(B), 860 (providing an\n\ninitial forty years for the specified quantity, doubled because of\n\nthe proximity to a protected location).    The government theorizes,\n\nhowever, that appellant may fairly be sentenced to the statutory\n\nmaximum that applies to larger quantities of drugs because the\n\ncourt found him responsible for twenty-two kilograms of cocaine.\n\nBased on that amount of cocaine, appellant would be subject to a\n\nminimum term of ten years and a maximum term of life imprisonment.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n\n          In advocating for the validity of a sentence based on the\n\ntwenty-two kilograms, the government relies on the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002). Applying\n\nplain error review, the Court in Cotton upheld sentences that were\n\nunlawful under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), because\n\nthe drug quantities used to calculate the sentence had not been\n\nalleged in the governing indictment.      Cotton, 535 U.S. at 632.\n\nAlthough the original indictment had alleged a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty grams or\n\nmore of crack -- quantities that exposed the defendants to life\n\nimprisonment, id. at 627, 633 n.3 -- the drug amounts were omitted\n\nfrom the superseding indictment as permitted by then-prevailing\n\nprecedent, id. at 628.     Following guilty verdicts, the court\n\nimposed sentences of thirty years and life imprisonment based on\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fundisputed quantities of crack far in excess of the statutory\n\nthreshold alleged in the original indictment.    Id.   The defendants\n\ndid not object based on the omission of quantity allegations in the\n\nindictment.\n\n            The Supreme Court held that, in the circumstances of that\n\ncase, the omission of drug amounts from the superseding indictment\n\n\"did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"      Id. at 632-33.   The Court\n\nnoted the \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted\" evidence\n\nthat the conspiracy involved at least fifty grams of cocaine base,\n\nid. at 633 (internal quotation marks omitted), and it concluded\n\nthat \"[s]urely the grand jury, having found that the conspiracy\n\nexisted, would have also found that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast 50 grams of cocaine base,\" id.\n\n            We disagree that Cotton leads to affirmance of the life\n\nsentence imposed in this case.      In addition to the problematic\n\ngeneral nature of the sentence here, a critical distinction between\n\nthe cases is that the grand jury in Cotton had originally charged\n\na drug quantity consistent with the district court's judgment. The\n\nomission of a drug quantity in the superseding indictment did not\n\nsignify a change in the prosecution's or grand jury's assessment of\n\nthe case.    Rather, it reflected the state of the law at the time,\n\nbefore the Supreme Court held that \"'any fact that increases the\n\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fsubmitted to a jury'\" and charged in the indictment.     Id. at 627\n\n(quoting Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490, 476); see also Brief for the\n\nUnited States, United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002) (No.\n\n01-687), 2002 WL 264766, at *46 (\"[T]here is no reason to suppose\n\nthat the grand jury meant to retract its earlier findings (which,\n\nunder the prevailing view of the law, were not required in an\n\nindictment).\").   In Cotton, therefore, the Court carried out the\n\noriginal charging decision when it rejected the defendants' claim\n\nof plain error.   Id. at 634; see also United States v. Cotton, 261\n\nF.3d 397, 414 (4th Cir. 2001) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (noting\n\nthat \"[t]here can be no doubt that had the prosecution been aware\n\nof the [subsequent change in the law], it would have made certain\n\nthat the superseding indictment mirrored the initial indictment\"),\n\nrev'd, Cotton, 535 U.S. at 625.   Moreover, when they were indicted\n\nfor a second time, the Cotton defendants, in light of the original\n\nindictment, would have understood that the charged conspiracy\n\nexposed them to the lengthy sentences ultimately imposed.        On\n\nappeal, they were seeking to benefit from an unanticipated change\n\nin the law.\n\n          Here, by contrast, there was no flaw in the indictment\n\nresulting from a subsequent change in the law: the grand jury did\n\nchoose a drug quantity and thereby set specific, statutorily\n\nprescribed limits on the sentence.     The problem, instead, is that\n\nthe district court imposed a term of imprisonment that exceeds the\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fstatutory maximum for the drug quantity selected by the grand jury.\n\nAs outlined above, the cocaine amount charged in Counts One and\n\nFive -- \"500 grams or more\" -- triggered a sentence under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) of \"not . . . less than 5 years and not more\n\nthan 40 years,\" doubled under § 860 to a maximum of eighty years.\n\nAffirming the sentence here would thus reduce the drug-quantity\n\nelement of the indictment to an irrelevancy.         Unlike in Cotton, it\n\nwould    mean   disregarding,   not    carrying   out,   the   grand   jury's\n\njudgment.8\n\n             Moreover, the government's position that the life terms\n\nshould stand on Counts One and Five is incompatible with the\n\nprocedure needed to correct the unlawful general sentence.              Where\n\nthe district court's obligation is to individually consider the\n\nappropriate punishment for each count, it would be unseemly for us\n\nto permit -- indeed, to direct -- an unlawful term of life\n\n\n\n     8\n       Because the superseding indictment in this case alleged an\namount of crack that could have triggered a life sentence at the\ntime the indictment was filed, the case would have borne more of a\nresemblance to Cotton if the quantity of crack had figured into\nappellant's sentencing calculus.     The district court, however,\nexplicitly excluded crack from consideration in sentencing.\nAppellant's pre-FSA exposure to a life sentence based on the crack\nallegations has no relevance to his exposure based on the quantity\nof regular cocaine.\n     Counsel's failure to object to the life term appears at least\npartially attributable to her focus on the Guidelines and the FSA's\nimpact.   She stated at the hearing that, even under the FSA,\nappellant \"would still be in a life category.\" Evidently, neither\ncounsel nor the court realized that life imprisonment exceeded the\nstatutory maximum once the crack was dropped from the sentencing\ncalculus.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fimprisonment on two of the counts. This overriding sentencing flaw\n\ndid not exist in Cotton.\n\n          In   these   circumstances,   we   reject   the   government's\n\nassertion that the life term of imprisonment survives the plain\n\nerror test.    Particularly in light of its severity, we conclude\n\nthat \"the fairness and integrity of the criminal justice system,\"\n\nCotton, 535 U.S. at 634, would be compromised if we were to enforce\n\nan unlawful life sentence that the government declined to seek at\n\nthe outset of the case, when it could have done so lawfully.         See\n\nJones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 243 n.6 (1999) (\"[U]nder the\n\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury\n\ntrial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior\n\nconviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be\n\ncharged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\").\n\n          We thus conclude that the district court's plain error in\n\nimposing a general sentence of life imprisonment on Counts One\n\nthrough Nine of the indictment requires us to vacate that sentence\n\nand remand for reconsideration of the sentence on every count.\n\nThat determination arguably makes it unnecessary for us to consider\n\nat this time appellant's other claims of error, which relate to the\n\nmanner in which the district court handled the original sentencing\n\nproceeding.    One of those issues warrants our attention, however,\n\nto ensure that it does not recur during resentencing. Importantly,\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fthat discussion will demonstrate that the fairness of the original\n\nsentencing proceeding was compromised.        Hence, the district court\n\nwill need to consider the appropriate sentence anew, rather than\n\nremedying the general sentence problem simply by specifying a term\n\nfor each count.      We therefore turn to the second challenge.\n\nC. Ex Parte Information\n\n           Appellant asserts that the district court erred in fixing\n\nhis sentence by considering information obtained during an ex parte\n\nmeeting with the probation department. The record is unclear about\n\nthe nature of the ex parte gathering and who was present, though\n\nthe   participants    apparently   included   multiple   judges   and   the\n\nprobation officer involved in the incident in which appellant and\n\ntwo others demanded to see a co-defendant's plea agreement.             The\n\nrecord does show that the district court concluded that appellant\n\nplayed the lead role in the encounter, and the court later factored\n\nthat conclusion into its sentencing decision.\n\n           A district court tasked with imposing an appropriate\n\nsentence \"enjoys 'broad discretion in the information it may\n\nreceive and consider regarding [a] defendant and his conduct.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Rodríguez, 489 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Curran, 926 F.2d\n\n59, 61 (1st Cir. 1991)); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3661 (\"No limitation\n\nshall be placed on the information concerning the background,\n\ncharacter, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fcourt of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose\n\nof imposing an appropriate sentence.\").               Under Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 32, however, the court is required to provide\n\nthe defendant with \"'a meaningful opportunity to comment on the\n\nfactual information on which his or her sentence is based.'\"\n\nRivera-Rodríguez, 489 F.3d at 53-54 (quoting United States v.\n\nBerzon, 941 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1991)); see also Irizarry v.\n\nUnited States, 553 U.S. 708, 715 (2008) (\"Sound practice dictates\n\nthat judges in all cases should make sure that the information\n\nprovided to the parties in advance of the hearing, and in the\n\nhearing itself, has given them an opportunity to confront and\n\ndebate the relevant [sentencing] issues.\"); Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(i)(1)(C).9         The Sentencing Guidelines likewise require that\n\ndefendants be given \"an adequate opportunity\" to address \"any\n\nfactor       important    to    the   sentencing   determination   [that]    is\n\nreasonably in dispute.\"           See U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3(a).\n\n                 The process here was inadequate.     Indeed, the government\n\ndoes       not   meaningfully    argue   otherwise,   largely   confining   its\n\nbriefing on this issue to a harmless error analysis.10              Appellant\n\n\n       9\n       Rule 32(i)(1)(C) states that the court \"must allow the\nparties' attorneys to comment on the probation officer's\ndeterminations and other matters relating to an appropriate\nsentence.\"\n       10\n       The government makes a listless attempt to justify the ex\nparte session on the ground that probation officers are \"'regarded\nas an extension of the court who provide[] the sentencing judge\nwith a wide range of information about the defendant and the\n\n                                         -24-\n\fwas alerted to the ex parte meeting for the first time during the\n\ncourt's sentencing pronouncement, and he thus had insufficient\n\nnotice and no opportunity to develop a response to any adverse\n\ninformation   communicated   there.     See   Berzon,   941   F.2d   at   18\n\n(\"'Th[e] right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one\n\nis informed.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting Burns v.

Hanover\n\nBank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)))).\n\n          Importantly, it appears that defense counsel also first\n\nlearned at the sentencing hearing that appellant had been depicted\n\nas \"the main actor\" in the prison episode.11     That characterization\n\nof appellant's role was prominent in the district court's oral\n\n\n\noffense.'\" Brief at 50 (quoting United States v.

The precedent\nthe government invokes is thus wholly inapt here.\n     11\n        So far as the record shows, the first reference to the\nincident itself was in the government's response to appellant's\nobjections to the presentence report.      Addressing appellant's\nargument that he was improperly labeled an \"enforcer\" for the drug\ntrafficking organization, the government stated in a footnote:\n\n     Defendant need not have used a firearm or killed someone\n     in order to be an enforcer. . . . Interestingly so, not\n     having learned his lesson and proving that he was in fact\n     an enforcer, defendant was involved in intimidating a\n     coconspirator, the coconspirator's attorney and a\n     probation officer during the probation officer's PSR\n     interview of a coconspirator in this case.\n\nDockt.

Both in its initial remarks and\n\nlater,    when   the    prosecutor     attempted   to    establish     that     the\n\nencounter was not the sole justification for the life sentence, the\n\ncourt invoked the incident as evidence that appellant was \"still\n\nexercising his position as [a] leader of the drug trafficking\n\norganization.\"     The court also cited the incident in its written\n\nStatement of Reasons.12\n\n            Appellant was thus improperly denied an opportunity to\n\nrespond to unfavorable information considered by the court in\n\nsentencing him.        As appellant is otherwise entitled to a complete\n\nresentencing, we need not examine the government's assertion that\n\nthe court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the\n\nundisclosed information, and that any such error was therefore\n\nharmless.\n\n            On   remand,    if   the    district   court   again      chooses    to\n\nconsider the information obtained at the meeting in its sentencing\n\ndetermination,     appellant     must     be   given    notice   of    what     was\n\ncommunicated about his conduct and an opportunity to respond.\n\n\n\n     12\n       The record leaves no doubt that the undisclosed information\ninfluenced the court's deliberations, whether or not it affected\nthe actual term imposed. We note one respect in which it may have\nhad a direct impact. At appellant's change-of-plea hearing, both\nthe prosecutor and court described appellant as a supervisor of the\ndrug trafficking organization, a role that would have triggered a\nthree-level upward adjustment in his BOL. At sentencing, the court\nimposed a four-level role-in-the-offense adjustment based on his\nstatus as a \"leader\" of the enterprise. The four-level adjustment\nhad been recommended in appellant's PSR.\n\n                                       -26-\n\fD.   Explanation\n\n           Appellant's two remaining challenges both concern the\n\ndistrict court's failure to explain the sentence it imposed.\n\nAppellant contends that the court (1) did not adequately explain\n\nits reasons for choosing the highest point of the guidelines range,\n\nas required by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1),13 and (2) improperly failed\n\nto give reasons for rejecting his detailed disparity argument.\n\nThese were both matters of consequence, particularly given the\n\nseverity   of   the    sentence   imposed.      However,   having    already\n\nestablished the need for resentencing, we decline to examine these\n\ncontentions.\n\n                                      III.\n\n           We   thus    hold   that     the   general   sentence    of   life\n\nimprisonment imposed on appellant must be vacated because it\n\nexceeds the statutory maximum on each of the nine counts.            We also\n\nmust consider whether the remand should be to the same or a\n\ndifferent judge, in light of the sentencing judge's improper\n\nreliance on ex parte information concerning the prison incident.\n\nSee United States v. Craven, 239 F.3d 91, 103 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nBerzon, 941 F.2d at 20.\n\n           Although the content of the ex parte meeting could be\n\nconsidered in the resentencing if it were disclosed to appellant\n\n\n     13\n       Section 3553(c)(1) requires the trial judge to explain its\nreasons for selecting a sentence at a particular point within a\nrange exceeding twenty-four months.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fand he were given the opportunity to respond, we are concerned that\n\nany such follow-up will necessarily occur long after the discussion\n\ntook place.     An accurate recounting of the event may no longer be\n\npossible.      In addition, the district court's ability to segregate\n\nthe information it obtained at the meeting would almost certainly\n\nbe diminished with the passage of time.              We previously have noted\n\nthat it would be \"difficult, if not impossible, for a judge, no\n\nmatter how sincere, to purge [ex parte] information from her mind\n\n-- and, equally, to maintain the perception of impartiality.\"\n\nCraven, 239 F.3d at 103.          That concern is apropos here.               The\n\nmaximum sentence on some counts remains very high -- 80 years --\n\nand   \"'both    for   the   judge's   own    sake,   and   the   appearance   of\n\njustice,'\" we conclude that remand to another judge is advisable.\n\nBerzon, 941 F.2d at 20 (quoting Mawson v. United States, 463 F.2d\n\n29, 31 (1st Cir. 1972)).\n\n            We therefore vacate appellant's sentence and remand for\n\nresentencing before a different judge.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\f",

Appellant José Manuel Zavala-Martí\n\n(\"Zavala\") challenges the life sentence he received for his role in\n\na large-scale drug operation that sold heroin, crack, cocaine, and\n\nmarijuana at a public housing project in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. The\n\nsecond of forty-seven defendants charged in a ten-count superseding\n\nindictment, Zavala pled guilty at the end of the first day of\n\ntestimony.    He identifies four substantial procedural flaws in his\n\nsentencing: (1) the imposition of a general sentence of life\n\nimprisonment on all counts when none of the crimes of conviction\n\nsupported    that   penalty;   (2)   the    court's       reliance   on   adverse\n\ninformation it received ex parte; (3) the court's failure to\n\nexplain why it chose the highest point in the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrange; and (4) the court's silence on his disparity argument.                  We\n\nneed reach only the first of these asserted problems to conclude\n\nthat resentencing is necessary.         In light of the resentencing, we\n\nalso find it advisable to address the ex parte issue.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n            We sketch here the factual and procedural background of\n\nthis case, describing only briefly the underlying drug conspiracy\n\nwhile recounting in more detail the sentencing proceedings that are\n\nat issue on appeal.\n\nA. The Drug Trafficking Conspiracy\n\n            From at least 2004 through early 2008, Cruz Roberto\n\nRamos-Gonzalez      (\"Belleza\")   was      running    a    multi-faceted     drug\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdistribution operation at the Victor Berríos Public Housing Project\n\nin Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as well as in several other locations.1\n\nAppellant Zavala was a high-level participant in the enterprise,\n\ndescribed by one co-defendant as Belleza's \"right-hand man\" and by\n\nanother as one of several \"lieutenants\" in the organization.\n\nAppellant    and   several      other       co-conspirators     served     as\n\n\"administrators\" of the drug points and were responsible, inter\n\nalia, for enforcing discipline and recruiting other participants.\n\nDuring the two years that appellant participated in the conspiracy,\n\nfrom 2005-2007,    the    organization    distributed   about   twenty-two\n\nkilograms of cocaine, among other drugs.\n\n            In August 2007, a federal grand jury returned a seven-\n\ncount indictment charging forty-four defendants with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute   heroin,     cocaine,   crack    cocaine,   and   marijuana.\n\nAppellant was named in all seven counts and surrendered to federal\n\nagents on October 16, 2007.         While in prison awaiting trial,\n\nappellant and several co-defendants sought to induce a cooperating\n\nco-defendant, Harry Smith Delgado-Cañuelas (\"Delgado\"), to recant\n\ntestimony he had given to the grand jury.         Appellant arranged for\n\nmore than $5,000 to be wired to Delgado, some deposited directly\n\ninto his prison commissary account and some delivered through third\n\nparties, in exchange for Delgado's signing and tape-recording false\n\n\n     1\n       We draw the facts from the trial transcript, appellant's\nadmissions at his change-of-plea hearing, his presentence\ninvestigation report (\"PSR\"), and his sentencing hearing.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fstatements about the conspiracy. Appellant also allegedly arranged\n\nto have a cell phone smuggled to Delgado in the prison so Delgado\n\ncould receive a call from Belleza, who was at that time a fugitive.\n\n            A ten-count superseding indictment was issued in early\n\n2008.      Appellant       was   listed    as    the     second    of     forty-seven\n\nindividuals    and    again      was   charged     in    all    counts.          Briefly\n\ndescribed, the indictment alleged a conspiracy, facilitated by the\n\nuse of firearms, to distribute various quantities of the drugs\n\nidentified    above    near      a   public     school    and     housing    project,\n\ndistribution of each of the narcotics, witness tampering, and\n\nbribery.     The three witness tampering and bribery charges were\n\nsevered from the others, and trial on the remaining seven counts\n\nbegan on October 13, 2009 for appellant and five co-defendants.\n\nAfter a two-day jury selection process and one day of testimony,\n\nappellant pled guilty, without a plea agreement, to all ten counts\n\nof the superseding indictment.\n\nB. The Charges\n\n            As the counts are central to the sentencing issues that\n\nare the basis for this appeal, we describe each of them: (i)\n\nconspiring to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, 500\n\ngrams or more of cocaine, 100 grams or more of heroin, and a\n\nmeasurable amount of marijuana within 1,000 feet of a public\n\nhousing project       or    public     school,   in     violation    of     21    U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 846 and 860 (Count One); (ii) conspiring to possess\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\ffirearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) and (o) (Count Two); (iii) aiding and\n\nabetting the distribution of 100 grams or more of heroin within\n\n1,000 feet of a public housing project or public school, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 860 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count\n\nThree); (iv) aiding and abetting in the distribution of fifty grams\n\nor more of cocaine base (\"crack\"), 500 grams or more of cocaine,\n\nand a measurable amount of marijuana within 1,000 feet of a public\n\nhousing project       or   public   school,   in   violation   of    21   U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 860 and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Counts Four, Five, and Six);\n\n(v) conspiring to tamper with a government witness, and aiding and\n\nabetting in government witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1512(b)(1), (k), and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Counts Seven and Eight); (vi)\n\naiding and abetting in the bribery of a government witness, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(3) and 2 (Count Nine); and (vii)\n\nforfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853 and Rule 32.2(a) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Count Ten).\n\nC. Sentencing\n\n           In   his    Sentencing    Memorandum,     appellant      proposed   a\n\nsentence   of   no    more   than   twelve    years'   imprisonment.        The\n\ngovernment responded with a recommended sentence of life in prison.\n\nThe wide discrepancy was attributable to, inter alia, the parties'\n\ndiffering assessments of appellant's role in the offense, the drug\n\nquantity for which he should be held responsible, and the need to\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\favoid sentencing disparity.      Appellant also argued that he should\n\nbe sentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\"FSA\"), which\n\nreduced the maximum statutory penalty for distributing the amount\n\nof crack cocaine alleged in the indictment (fifty grams) from life\n\nin prison to forty years.         See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii)\n\n(2009); id. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2011).         In addition, he sought\n\nleniency   based   on   his   personal   circumstances,   including   his\n\naddiction to alcohol and abuse of prescribed medications.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, appellant's counsel reiterated\n\nthe request for a sentence of twelve years, emphasizing appellant's\n\ndownward spiral following the tragic death of his brother and his\n\nsusceptibility at that time to Belleza's bad influence.        Evidence\n\npresented to the court showed that appellant had lived a stable,\n\nproductive life until his younger brother's murder when appellant\n\nwas in his early twenties.2         Appellant's common-law wife, the\n\nmother of his two sons, stated that \"everything changed\" after the\n\nbrother's murder, which remains an unsolved crime.          Appellant's\n\nfather reported that his son became \"unstable,\" explaining that he\n\ndrank too much, became addicted to a prescription drug, and started\n\nto associate with the wrong crowd.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       On the day before appellant's sentencing hearing, his\ncounsel submitted a DVD containing video statements from family\nmembers, including his parents, brother, and sister. The record\ncontains a transcript of the statements that was prepared by a\ncertified court reporter.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            Counsel   also     emphasized       that   similarly      situated\n\ndefendants in other cases had been offered sentences comparable to\n\nappellant's proposed twelve-year term.          She further noted that the\n\ngovernment had previously offered to recommend a seventeen-year\n\nsentence in exchange for a guilty plea.          Though appellant rejected\n\nthat deal, counsel argued that a life sentence was not justified\n\nbecause \"[t]he evidence remains the same.\"\n\n            The   prosecutor   likewise    renewed     at   the   hearing   the\n\ngovernment's request for a life sentence, explaining that even a\n\n\"conservative\" approach to the drug calculation -- considering only\n\nthe amount of cocaine and not any other drug -- generated a\n\nguidelines range of 360 months to life.            In response to defense\n\ncounsel's    disparity    argument,       the    prosecutor       argued    that\n\nappellant's situation differed from that of the individuals cited\n\nfor comparison because, unlike them, appellant had not entered into\n\na plea agreement. The prosecutor emphasized appellant's leadership\n\nactivities in the conspiracy, as well as his key role in the effort\n\nto procure false testimony from Delgado.\n\n            The prosecutor also brought up an incident involving\n\nappellant that occurred at the prison during his incarceration,\n\nseparate from the witness tampering activity and after he had been\n\ncharged in the superseding indictment.           Along with two other men\n\n(one co-defendant and an unidentified third person), appellant\n\nentered an interview room where a probation officer was meeting\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fwith another co-defendant and his attorney and demanded to see the\n\nco-defendant's plea agreement.         According to the government, the\n\nprobation officer and attorney were intimidated by the encounter.\n\n           Asserting that appellant had \"not shown that anything\n\nthat has happened to him from all these years will deter him from\n\nconducting future criminal acts,\" the government predicted his\n\nlikelihood   of    rehabilitation    at    \"zero   to    none.\"       Hence,    it\n\nrecommended the highest guidelines sentence.\n\n           Defense counsel responded by again raising the disparity\n\nargument, noting, inter alia, that the court had imposed that day\n\na twenty-year term on a similarly situated co-defendant (Defendant\n\nNo. 4 in the indictment).        Counsel also reported that the attorney\n\ninvolved in the prison episode cited by the government had told her\n\n-- contrary to the government's representation -- that he had not\n\nfelt intimidated.      Finally, she emphasized that appellant had in\n\nfact shown a capacity for rehabilitation in the previous twelve to\n\nfourteen months and had broken ties to his criminal associates.\n\n           In     imposing   sentence,     the   district     court    accepted\n\nappellant's contention that he participated in the conspiracy for\n\nonly   twenty-four     months.      Accordingly,        the   court   held     him\n\naccountable for the distribution of about twenty-two kilograms of\n\ncocaine. The court stated that it \"took under advisement the issue\n\nof the amendments to the Fair Sentencing Act,\" and explained that\n\nit was \"not in any way calculating any base offense level based on\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fany crack cocaine.\"     The court thus adopted appellant's proposed\n\nstarting base offense level (\"BOL\") of 34. It increased the BOL by\n\ntwo levels because the drug dealing occurred near a protected\n\nlocation, see U.S.S.G. § 2D1.2(a)(1), added another two levels for\n\nthe possession of firearms, see id. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and two more for\n\nobstruction of justice, see id. § 3C1.1.          The court rejected\n\nappellant's contention that he should be treated as a supervisor of\n\nthe drug organization, rather than a leader, and thus added four\n\nlevels   for   appellant's     role    in   the    offense.      See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a).3   Finally, the court granted appellant a two-\n\nlevel downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.      See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a).    The resulting BOL was 42, and the applicable\n\ncriminal history category was I.       As a result, the sentencing\n\nguidelines range was 360 months to life imprisonment.\n\n          The district court prefaced its sentencing pronouncement\n\nwith a summary of appellant's criminal conduct, including his\n\nposition as \"the second in command of one of the most dangerous\n\ndrug trafficking organizations operating in the eastern part of\n\nPuerto Rico,\" his \"principal role in the efforts to get the\n\n\n     3\n        At appellant's change-of-plea hearing, the court had\ndescribed appellant's role in the conspiracy as a \"supervisor.\"\nThe prosecutor stated at that hearing that appellant was a\nsupervisor of five or more people and that he \"acted as the\nlieutenant of the place on behalf of the drug trafficking\norganization.\"   Under the guidelines, a supervisory role would\nresult in a three-level increase in the BOL rather than the four-\nlevel adjustment for a leadership role. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fGovernment's main cooperator to recant his testimony,\" and his\n\n\"instrumental\" role in smuggling the cell phone to Delgado.   The\n\ncourt also cited the episode at the prison involving the probation\n\ninterview:\n\n                 The Court has also received information\n          from the probation office that this defendant\n          along with another co-defendant also attempted\n          to intimidate another U.S. probation officer,\n          who was at the time conducting the presentence\n          interview of a co-defendant in this instant\n          case at MDC Guaynabo.\n\n                 The defendant interrupted the interview\n          and demanded to see the co-defendant's Plea\n          Agreement, which is confidential and against\n          Bureau of Prisons' rules and regulations, all\n          to verify if said co-defendant was cooperating\n          with the Government.\n\n          . . .\n\n                  Although   Counsel   says   that   she\n          interviewed the lawyer involved in the issue\n          with the probation officer, as a result of\n          that incident, it was brought to the attention\n          of the Court. We held a meeting with all the\n          judges present, probation office, where the\n          probation officer who was involved, certainly\n          related    to  the Court    the   events  that\n          transpired and how she was intimidated at the\n          time she was interviewing another co-defendant\n          who had pled guilty.\n\n                 Mr. Zavala was accompanied by another\n          co-defendant and another person who was not\n          identified. And he was the main actor of that\n          incident.    It shows that he was still\n          exercising his position as leader of the drug\n          trafficking organization, at least of those\n          that were in prison.\n\n                 So in order to reflect the seriousness\n          of the offense, to promote respect for the law\n          and to provide just punishment for the\n\n                              -10-\n\f           offense, it is the judgment of this Court the\n           defendant is hereby committed to the custody\n           of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for\n           the remainder of his natural life.\n\n           Immediately following the imposition of sentence, defense\n\ncounsel, noting the court's reliance on the ex parte meeting with\n\nthe probation officer, asked the court to vacate the sentence so\n\nthat she could review any written reports or videotapes of that\n\nmeeting.   The judge responded that there was no memorialization of\n\nthe meeting: \"It was just a sit down with the probation officer and\n\nthat was it.    We were given information as to what transpired at\n\nthat time.\"    Counsel's ensuing request for an opportunity to call\n\nthe probation officer to the stand was denied.\n\n           Near the close of the proceeding, the prosecutor sought\n\nto clarify the court's reference to the incident:\n\n           Prosecutor: Counsel . . . [said] that Your\n           Honor expressly used the incident with the\n           probation officer . . . to make a judgment of\n           life imprisonment. And I just want to clarify\n           for the record, that wasn't the only factor,\n           the expressed factor for Your Honor's basis.\n\n                  Court: No, no. I expressed it. And if\n           you notice that when the latter part of that\n           statement I said that that shows that he was\n           still exercising his position as leadership\n           while in prison over the other co-defendants\n           in this case that were in prison.\n                  That's the only reason I brought it\n           forth, to show that he was still a[]head of\n           that group and he was still exercising [a]\n           leadership role.\n\n                   Prosecutor: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f                 Court: That's the only reason I brought\n          it up, because I know it doesn't influence the\n          sentence.\n\n          The court did not announce a sentence on each count\n\nseparately, and its subsequent written judgment also recorded the\n\nsentence of \"[i]mprisonment for the remainder of his natural life\"\n\nwithout linking it to individual counts.4   The forfeiture count,\n\nCount Ten, was dismissed.5   A section of the court's Statement of\n\nReasons filed as part of the judgment, titled \"Additional Facts\n\nJustifying the Sentence in this Case,\" stated, in part: \"The Court\n\nalso received information that defendant along with another co-\n\ndefendant also attempted to intim[id]ate another U.S. Probation\n\n\n\n     4\n       The same language appeared in an amended judgment, which\nadded (at appellant's request) to the list of institutions the\ncourt recommended to the Bureau of Prisons for appellant's\nplacement.\n     5\n       The Docket entries for the documents titled \"Judgment in a\nCriminal Case\" (No. 2579) and \"Amended Judgment in a Criminal Case\"\n(No. 2788) do list each count separately and in sequence, grouping\nthe counts with identical supervised release terms and monetary\nassessments.

SMA of $100.00[.]\n\nAt both the sentencing hearing and in the Judgments themselves,\nhowever, the court imposed an undifferentiated life term.       The\nclerk's entry cannot add substantively to the court's judgment, and\nthe government does not argue otherwise. See generally Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 32(k)(1) (\"In the judgment of conviction, the court must\nset forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court's findings, the\nadjudication, and the sentence. . . .

Second, he\n\nargues    that    the    court    committed      a   due   process   violation   by\n\nimproperly relying on adverse factual information obtained in the\n\nex parte meeting with the probation officer.                    Third, appellant\n\nasserts that the court erred by failing to explain why it chose to\n\nsentence him at the specific point within the guidelines range, as\n\nrequired by statute when the range spans more than twenty-four\n\nmonths.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1).               Finally, he argues that the\n\ncourt erred       by    giving    no   reason    for   rejecting     his disparity\n\nargument.     As noted above, we reach only the first two of these\n\ncontentions.\n\nA.

The General Sentence of Life Imprisonment\n\n               The government concedes that the imposition of a general\n\nsentence of life imprisonment was improper, as no count in the\n\nindictment       supported   such     a    sentence,6      and    it     agrees    that\n\n\n     6\n       The government asserts in its brief that a general sentence\nis not per se unlawful when the term imposed does not exceed the\nmaximum for one or more counts.      The defendant argues that a\ngeneral sentence is improper regardless of its propriety for\ndiscrete counts. We need not enter that debate, as the government\nconcedes that the life sentence imposed here was not authorized for\nany of the nine counts.\n\n                                          -14-\n\fresentencing is necessary on most of the counts.7       It argues,\n\nhowever, that the life term should stand on two of the drug counts\n\n-- Counts One and Five -- because appellant cannot satisfy the\n\nplain error standard with respect to those two counts.      Before\n\nexamining the competing views of the appropriate remedy for the\n\nacknowledged error, we briefly digress to explain the FSA's effect\n\non the case.\n\n          1. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\n\n          In Count One of the indictment, appellant was charged\n\nwith conspiring to possess for distribution 50 grams or more of\n\ncrack, along with varying quantities of other drugs.    Count Four\n\nalleged that he in fact possessed, with the intent to distribute,\n\n\n\n     We note, however, that we have stated that \"[t]he proper\nprocedure\" is to \"render a separate sentence on each count.\" See\nUnited States v.

Although the\ngovernment's brief asserted that resentencing on Count Seven was\nunnecessary, the government acknowledged at oral argument that it\nhad erred in so arguing.\n\n                               -15-\n\f50 grams or more of crack.               At the time the indictment was filed,\n\na defendant convicted of a distribution offense involving 50 grams\n\nor more of crack was exposed to a maximum statutory term of life\n\nimprisonment.            By the time appellant was sentenced, however, the\n\nFSA had reduced the maximum penalty for that amount of crack to 40\n\nyears, and it increased the trigger amount for a life sentence to\n\n280   grams        or    more.         See   21    U.S.C.    §    841   (b)(1)(B)(iii),\n\n(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n\n              As described above, appellant argued in his sentencing\n\nmemorandum that he was entitled to be sentenced under the FSA, with\n\nits reduced penalty for the charged amount of crack.                        The Supreme\n\nCourt   recently             agreed,   holding     that     FSA   penalties    apply    to\n\noffenders, such as appellant, who were sentenced after the statute\n\nwent into effect.               See Dorsey v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"802791\"><a href=\"/opinion/802791/dorsey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, at the time of appellant's sentencing, the\n\ncrack cocaine averments in the indictment supported a maximum\n\nsentence of forty years, doubled to eighty years because the drug\n\ndealing took place in proximity to a school and public housing\n\nproject.      See 21 U.S.C. § 860(a).\n\n              As        it    turned    out,      the   district    court     explicitly\n\ndisclaimed reliance on any amount of crack cocaine in imposing\n\nsentence and \"took under advisement\" the impact of the FSA.                            The\n\ngovernment did not object to the court's approach. We thus proceed\n\n\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\fwith our analysis without taking into account the crack cocaine\n\nallegations.\n\n           2. Plain Error\n\n           Where a defendant fails to present a claim of error to\n\nthe district court, as is the case with appellant's challenge to\n\nthe general life term, he must satisfy a demanding four-prong\n\ninquiry to obtain relief.     To demonstrate reversible plain error,\n\na defendant must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was\n\nclear and obvious, and it not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights but also (4) \"'impaired the fairness, integrity,\n\nor public reputation of the judicial proceedings.'\"        United States\n\nv.

The\n\ngovernment asserts that, even if appellant can satisfy the first\n\nthree requirements with respect to Counts One and Five, he cannot\n\nsatisfy the fourth prong.\n\n           As we have described, Count One alleges that appellant\n\nconspired to distribute fifty or more grams of cocaine base, 500\n\ngrams or more of cocaine, 100 grams or more            of heroin, and\n\nmeasurable amounts of marijuana, all within 1,000 feet of a public\n\nhousing   project   or   public   school.   Count   Five   alleges   that\n\nappellant aided and abetted in the distribution of 500 grams or\n\nmore of cocaine, also within 1,000 feet of a housing project or\n\npublic school.      The statutory maximum penalty for the crimes\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\falleged in the two counts, which is linked to drug quantities, is\n\neighty years.   See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(B), 860 (providing an\n\ninitial forty years for the specified quantity, doubled because of\n\nthe proximity to a protected location).    The government theorizes,\n\nhowever, that appellant may fairly be sentenced to the statutory\n\nmaximum that applies to larger quantities of drugs because the\n\ncourt found him responsible for twenty-two kilograms of cocaine.\n\nBased on that amount of cocaine, appellant would be subject to a\n\nminimum term of ten years and a maximum term of life imprisonment.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n\n          In advocating for the validity of a sentence based on the\n\ntwenty-two kilograms, the government relies on the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Cotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). Applying\n\nplain error review, the Court in Cotton upheld sentences that were\n\nunlawful under Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), because\n\nthe drug quantities used to calculate the sentence had not been\n\nalleged in the governing indictment.      Cotton, 535 U.S. at 632.\n\nAlthough the original indictment had alleged a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty grams or\n\nmore of crack -- quantities that exposed the defendants to life\n\nimprisonment, id. at 627, 633 n.3 -- the drug amounts were omitted\n\nfrom the superseding indictment as permitted by then-prevailing\n\nprecedent, id. at 628.     Following guilty verdicts, the court\n\nimposed sentences of thirty years and life imprisonment based on\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fundisputed quantities of crack far in excess of the statutory\n\nthreshold alleged in the original indictment.    Id.   The defendants\n\ndid not object based on the omission of quantity allegations in the\n\nindictment.\n\n            The Supreme Court held that, in the circumstances of that\n\ncase, the omission of drug amounts from the superseding indictment\n\n\"did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"      Id. at 632-33.   The Court\n\nnoted the \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted\" evidence\n\nthat the conspiracy involved at least fifty grams of cocaine base,\n\nid. at 633 (internal quotation marks omitted), and it concluded\n\nthat \"[s]urely the grand jury, having found that the conspiracy\n\nexisted, would have also found that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast 50 grams of cocaine base,\" id.\n\n            We disagree that Cotton leads to affirmance of the life\n\nsentence imposed in this case.      In addition to the problematic\n\ngeneral nature of the sentence here, a critical distinction between\n\nthe cases is that the grand jury in Cotton had originally charged\n\na drug quantity consistent with the district court's judgment. The\n\nomission of a drug quantity in the superseding indictment did not\n\nsignify a change in the prosecution's or grand jury's assessment of\n\nthe case.    Rather, it reflected the state of the law at the time,\n\nbefore the Supreme Court held that \"'any fact that increases the\n\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fsubmitted to a jury'\" and charged in the indictment.

Moreover, when they were indicted\n\nfor a second time, the Cotton defendants, in light of the original\n\nindictment, would have understood that the charged conspiracy\n\nexposed them to the lengthy sentences ultimately imposed.        On\n\nappeal, they were seeking to benefit from an unanticipated change\n\nin the law.\n\n          Here, by contrast, there was no flaw in the indictment\n\nresulting from a subsequent change in the law: the grand jury did\n\nchoose a drug quantity and thereby set specific, statutorily\n\nprescribed limits on the sentence.     The problem, instead, is that\n\nthe district court imposed a term of imprisonment that exceeds the\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fstatutory maximum for the drug quantity selected by the grand jury.\n\nAs outlined above, the cocaine amount charged in Counts One and\n\nFive -- \"500 grams or more\" -- triggered a sentence under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) of \"not . . . less than 5 years and not more\n\nthan 40 years,\" doubled under § 860 to a maximum of eighty years.\n\nAffirming the sentence here would thus reduce the drug-quantity\n\nelement of the indictment to an irrelevancy.         Unlike in Cotton, it\n\nwould    mean   disregarding,   not    carrying   out,   the   grand   jury's\n\njudgment.8\n\n             Moreover, the government's position that the life terms\n\nshould stand on Counts One and Five is incompatible with the\n\nprocedure needed to correct the unlawful general sentence.              Where\n\nthe district court's obligation is to individually consider the\n\nappropriate punishment for each count, it would be unseemly for us\n\nto permit -- indeed, to direct -- an unlawful term of life\n\n\n\n     8\n       Because the superseding indictment in this case alleged an\namount of crack that could have triggered a life sentence at the\ntime the indictment was filed, the case would have borne more of a\nresemblance to Cotton if the quantity of crack had figured into\nappellant's sentencing calculus.     The district court, however,\nexplicitly excluded crack from consideration in sentencing.\nAppellant's pre-FSA exposure to a life sentence based on the crack\nallegations has no relevance to his exposure based on the quantity\nof regular cocaine.\n     Counsel's failure to object to the life term appears at least\npartially attributable to her focus on the Guidelines and the FSA's\nimpact.   She stated at the hearing that, even under the FSA,\nappellant \"would still be in a life category.\" Evidently, neither\ncounsel nor the court realized that life imprisonment exceeded the\nstatutory maximum once the crack was dropped from the sentencing\ncalculus.\n\n                                      -21-\n\fimprisonment on two of the counts. This overriding sentencing flaw\n\ndid not exist in Cotton.\n\n          In   these   circumstances,   we   reject   the   government's\n\nassertion that the life term of imprisonment survives the plain\n\nerror test.    Particularly in light of its severity, we conclude\n\nthat \"the fairness and integrity of the criminal justice system,\"\n\nCotton, 535 U.S. at 634, would be compromised if we were to enforce\n\nan unlawful life sentence that the government declined to seek at\n\nthe outset of the case, when it could have done so lawfully.         See\n\nJones v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 n.6 (1999) (\"[U]nder the\n\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury\n\ntrial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior\n\nconviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be\n\ncharged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\").\n\n          We thus conclude that the district court's plain error in\n\nimposing a general sentence of life imprisonment on Counts One\n\nthrough Nine of the indictment requires us to vacate that sentence\n\nand remand for reconsideration of the sentence on every count.\n\nThat determination arguably makes it unnecessary for us to consider\n\nat this time appellant's other claims of error, which relate to the\n\nmanner in which the district court handled the original sentencing\n\nproceeding.    One of those issues warrants our attention, however,\n\nto ensure that it does not recur during resentencing. Importantly,\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fthat discussion will demonstrate that the fairness of the original\n\nsentencing proceeding was compromised.        Hence, the district court\n\nwill need to consider the appropriate sentence anew, rather than\n\nremedying the general sentence problem simply by specifying a term\n\nfor each count.      We therefore turn to the second challenge.\n\nC. Ex Parte Information\n\n           Appellant asserts that the district court erred in fixing\n\nhis sentence by considering information obtained during an ex parte\n\nmeeting with the probation department. The record is unclear about\n\nthe nature of the ex parte gathering and who was present, though\n\nthe   participants    apparently   included   multiple   judges   and   the\n\nprobation officer involved in the incident in which appellant and\n\ntwo others demanded to see a co-defendant's plea agreement.             The\n\nrecord does show that the district court concluded that appellant\n\nplayed the lead role in the encounter, and the court later factored\n\nthat conclusion into its sentencing decision.\n\n           A district court tasked with imposing an appropriate\n\nsentence \"enjoys 'broad discretion in the information it may\n\nreceive and consider regarding [a] defendant and his conduct.'\"\n\nUnited States v.

Here, however, the information\ncommunicated ex parte was not from a \"neutral, information-\ngathering agent of the court,\" Johnson, 935 F.2d at 50, but from a\nparticipant in an incident involving the defendant. The precedent\nthe government invokes is thus wholly inapt here.\n     11\n        So far as the record shows, the first reference to the\nincident itself was in the government's response to appellant's\nobjections to the presentence report.      Addressing appellant's\nargument that he was improperly labeled an \"enforcer\" for the drug\ntrafficking organization, the government stated in a footnote:\n\n     Defendant need not have used a firearm or killed someone\n     in order to be an enforcer. . . . Interestingly so, not\n     having learned his lesson and proving that he was in fact\n     an enforcer, defendant was involved in intimidating a\n     coconspirator, the coconspirator's attorney and a\n     probation officer during the probation officer's PSR\n     interview of a coconspirator in this case.\n\nDockt. No. 2544, at 3 n.2.\n\n                                 -25-\n\fexplanation of the sentence.            Both in its initial remarks and\n\nlater,    when   the    prosecutor     attempted   to    establish     that     the\n\nencounter was not the sole justification for the life sentence, the\n\ncourt invoked the incident as evidence that appellant was \"still\n\nexercising his position as [a] leader of the drug trafficking\n\norganization.\"     The court also cited the incident in its written\n\nStatement of Reasons.12\n\n            Appellant was thus improperly denied an opportunity to\n\nrespond to unfavorable information considered by the court in\n\nsentencing him.        As appellant is otherwise entitled to a complete\n\nresentencing, we need not examine the government's assertion that\n\nthe court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the\n\nundisclosed information, and that any such error was therefore\n\nharmless.\n\n            On   remand,    if   the    district   court   again      chooses    to\n\nconsider the information obtained at the meeting in its sentencing\n\ndetermination,     appellant     must     be   given    notice   of    what     was\n\ncommunicated about his conduct and an opportunity to respond.\n\n\n\n     12\n       The record leaves no doubt that the undisclosed information\ninfluenced the court's deliberations, whether or not it affected\nthe actual term imposed. We note one respect in which it may have\nhad a direct impact. At appellant's change-of-plea hearing, both\nthe prosecutor and court described appellant as a supervisor of the\ndrug trafficking organization, a role that would have triggered a\nthree-level upward adjustment in his BOL. At sentencing, the court\nimposed a four-level role-in-the-offense adjustment based on his\nstatus as a \"leader\" of the enterprise. The four-level adjustment\nhad been recommended in appellant's PSR.\n\n                                       -26-\n\fD.   Explanation\n\n           Appellant's two remaining challenges both concern the\n\ndistrict court's failure to explain the sentence it imposed.\n\nAppellant contends that the court (1) did not adequately explain\n\nits reasons for choosing the highest point of the guidelines range,\n\nas required by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(1),13 and (2) improperly failed\n\nto give reasons for rejecting his detailed disparity argument.\n\nThese were both matters of consequence, particularly given the\n\nseverity   of   the    sentence   imposed.      However,   having    already\n\nestablished the need for resentencing, we decline to examine these\n\ncontentions.\n\n                                      III.\n\n           We   thus    hold   that     the   general   sentence    of   life\n\nimprisonment imposed on appellant must be vacated because it\n\nexceeds the statutory maximum on each of the nine counts.            We also\n\nmust consider whether the remand should be to the same or a\n\ndifferent judge, in light of the sentencing judge's improper\n\nreliance on ex parte information concerning the prison incident.\n\nSee United States v.

An accurate recounting of the event may no longer be\n\npossible.      In addition, the district court's ability to segregate\n\nthe information it obtained at the meeting would almost certainly\n\nbe diminished with the passage of time.              We previously have noted\n\nthat it would be \"difficult, if not impossible, for a judge, no\n\nmatter how sincere, to purge [ex parte] information from her mind\n\n-- and, equally, to maintain the perception of impartiality.\"\n\nCraven, 239 F.3d at 103.
