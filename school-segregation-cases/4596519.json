Dallas Oounty,\n of course, 1s Included within the purview of coverage of the\n\fHonorable Henry Wade   Page 4\" (WW-403)\nlatter enactments, since its population Is Inexcess of\nthe prescribed one hundred thousand (100,000). According\nto the 1950 United States Census the population of Dallas\ncounty is 614,799.\n   With separate statutes providing for the appointment of a\nCounty Purchasing Agent for Dallas County, the provisions of\nwhich are Inconsistent, the question arises as to which sta-\ntute shall prevail. We are of the view that House Bill,452,\nsupra, had the effect of expressly repealing Senat~e.B111,283,\nbecause It contained a general and express repealer and was\na later expression of the intent of the 55th Legislature.\nEven if Senate Bill 283, supra; had remained In effect, it\nIs our further opinion that as between it and Rouse Bill 736,\nsupra, the two statutes here in question are Inconsistent and\nare in Irreconcilable conflict, and iach is repugnant to the\nother. Since both statutes pertain to the same subject and\nare thus In     ,.materia,the doctrine of repeal by implica-\nt%on is app     Ze in this instance. We can perceive of no\nconstruction which would give effect to both statutes by\nmating the latter Act cumulative of the former.\n   Section 1 (a) of Rouse Bill 736, supra, having been enacted\nby the 55th Legislature, is the last expression of the lnten-\ntlon of the Legislature concerning appointment of a County,\nPurchasing Agent in counties with a population in excess of\n100.000.

Dallas Oounty,\n of course, 1s Included within the purview of coverage of the\n\fHonorable Henry Wade   Page 4\" (WW-403)\nlatter enactments, since its population Is Inexcess of\nthe prescribed one hundred thousand (100,000). According\nto the 1950 United States Census the population of Dallas\ncounty is 614,799.\n   With separate statutes providing for the appointment of a\nCounty Purchasing Agent for Dallas County, the provisions of\nwhich are Inconsistent, the question arises as to which sta-\ntute shall prevail. We are of the view that House Bill,452,\nsupra, had the effect of expressly repealing Senat~e.B111,283,\nbecause It contained a general and express repealer and was\na later expression of the intent of the 55th Legislature.\nEven if Senate Bill 283, supra; had remained In effect, it\nIs our further opinion that as between it and Rouse Bill 736,\nsupra, the two statutes here in question are Inconsistent and\nare in Irreconcilable conflict, and iach is repugnant to the\nother. Since both statutes pertain to the same subject and\nare thus In     ,.materia,the doctrine of repeal by implica-\nt%on is app     Ze in this instance. We can perceive of no\nconstruction which would give effect to both statutes by\nmating the latter Act cumulative of the former.\n   Section 1 (a) of Rouse Bill 736, supra, having been enacted\nby the 55th Legislature, is the last expression of the lnten-\ntlon of the Legislature concerning appointment of a County,\nPurchasing Agent in counties with a population in excess of\n100.000.
