Ct. No. BC403167\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        This case presents the issue of how petroleum refinery property should be\nvalued for purposes of taxation. In 1979, in response to the passage of Proposition\n13 and related constitutional and statutory enactments, the state Board of\nEqualization (Board) enacted a rule for assessing the value of most industrial\nproperty. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 461.) Under that rule, the value of\nfixtures, including machinery and equipment, was assessed separately from the\nvalue of land and improvements. Petroleum refinery property was assessed in this\nmanner. The separate valuation of fixtures was advantageous to industrial\nproperty owners because it allowed them to maximize the tax savings attributable\nto the depreciation of fixtures.\n        In 2007, the Board enacted rule 474 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 474;\nhereafter Rule 474) in light of evidence that petroleum refinery property — land,\nimprovements, and fixtures — was generally sold as a unit. Rule 474 provides\nthat the value of such property, unlike most industrial property, must be assessed\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fas a unit. The Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) sued to invalidate\nthe regulation. WSPA contends that Rule 474 is inconsistent with Proposition 13\nand related statutory enactments, and is therefore an unlawful exercise of the\nBoard‘s rulemaking authority. WSPA also contends that the rule is procedurally\ninvalid because the Board failed to assess the economic impact of the regulation as\nrequired by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) (Gov. Code, § 11346 et\nseq.).\n         The trial court and the Court of Appeal held Rule 474 invalid on both\ngrounds. We conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in finding Rule 474 to be\nsubstantively invalid. As explained below, Rule 474 is consistent with applicable\nconstitutional and statutory provisions, and it is also consistent with the long-\nstanding valuation principle that the proper appraisal unit is the collection of assets\nthat persons in the marketplace normally buy and sell as a single unit. Thus, the\nadoption of Rule 474 did not exceed the Board‘s rulemaking authority. At the\nsame time, however, we hold that the Board failed to provide an adequate\nassessment of the rule‘s economic impact as required by the APA. Under the\nAPA, the Board was required to make a reasoned estimate of all cost impacts of\nthe rule on affected parties. This the Board did not do. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeal on the ground that Rule 474 is procedurally\ndeficient under the APA.\n         We note that ―[o]rdinarily, when an appellate court concludes that\naffirmance of the judgment is proper on certain grounds it will rest its decision on\nthose grounds and not consider alternative grounds which may be available.\n[Citations.] [¶] However, appellate courts depart from this general rule in cases\nwhere the determination is of great importance to the parties and may serve to\navoid future litigation [citations], or where the issue presented is of continuing\npublic interest and is likely to recur. [Citation.])‖ (Filipino Accountants’ Assn. v.\n\n                                          2\n\fState Bd. of Accountancy (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 1023, 1029–1030; see also\nCounty of Marin v. Superior Court (1960) 53 Cal.2d 633, 640; 9 Witkin Cal.\nProcedure (5th ed. 2008) Appeal, § 344, pp. 394–395.) Here, although the rule‘s\nprocedural deficiency is a sufficient basis for affirming the Court of Appeal‘s\njudgment, our consideration of the substantive ground for invalidating the rule is\nwarranted. The issue presents a question of law, it has been thoroughly briefed,\nand it is a matter of considerable importance to the parties and to the public.\n                                           I.\n       Article XIII, section 1 of the California Constitution declares that ―[a]ll\nproperty is taxable and shall be assessed at the same percentage of fair market\nvalue.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII, § 1, subd. (a).) Proposition 13, an initiative\nmeasure enacted in June 1978, added article XIII A to the California Constitution\nand changed the taxation of real property by replacing ―the fair market valuation\nstandard with that of acquisition value.‖ (Roy E. Hanson, Jr. Mfg. v. County of\nLos Angeles (1980) 27 Cal.3d 870, 873.) Article XIII A, section 2 provides that\nall real property, except for property acquired prior to 1975, shall be assessed and\ntaxed at its value on the date of acquisition, subject to a 2 percent maximum\nannual inflationary increase. (Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. (1978)\n22 Cal.3d 208, 235.) This is sometimes referred to as the indexed or adjusted base\nyear value. (See Bd. of Equalization, Assessors‘ Handbook Section 501, Basic\nAppraisal (2002 rev.) appen. A, Assessment Pre- and Post-Proposition 13, p. 137.)\n       Proposition 13 did not address how real property should be assessed and\ntaxed when its market value declines instead of appreciates. To address this issue,\nCalifornia voters passed Proposition 8 in November 1978. Proposition 8 amended\narticle XIII A so that it now reads: ―The full cash value base may reflect from\nyear to year the inflationary rate not to exceed 2 percent for any given year or\nreduction as shown in the consumer price index or comparable data for the area\n\n                                           3\n\funder taxing jurisdiction, or may be reduced to reflect substantial damage,\ndestruction, or other factors causing a decline in value.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII A,\n§ 2, subd. (b).) In other words, when the value of real property declines to a level\nbelow its adjusted base year value under Proposition 13, the value of the property\nis determined according to its actual fair market value.\n       The Legislature formed a task force to study the implementation of the new\nreal property tax system mandated by Proposition 13 and Proposition 8. In\nJanuary 1979, the task force submitted a report and recommendations to the\nAssembly Committee on Revenue and Taxation, officially titled Report of the\nTask Force on Property Tax Administration (hereafter Task Force Report). (See\nPacific Southwest Realty Co. v. County of Los Angeles (1991) 1 Cal 4th 155, 161.)\nThe Task Force Report has been recognized as a statement of legislative intent for\npurposes of interpreting the statutes enacted to implement Proposition 13 and\nProposition 8. (See, e.g., Auerbach v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 1 (2006) 39\nCal.4th 153, 161.)\n       The report recommended that ―the assessed value of real property be the\nlesser of the Prop. 13 base value compounded annually by 2% or full cash value.\nThese changes will be measured by that appraisal unit which is commonly bought\nand sold in the market, or which is normally valued separately.‖ (Task Force\nRep., supra, at p. 29.) Revenue and Taxation Code section 51 was subsequently\namended to incorporate the task force recommendations. (All further statutory\nreferences are to the Revenue and Taxation Code unless otherwise specified.)\nSection 51, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 51(a)) provides that ―the taxable\nvalue of real property shall . . . be the lesser of: [¶] (1) Its base year value,\ncompounded since the base year by an inflation factor‖ not to exceed 2 percent per\nyear, or ―(2) Its full cash value, as defined in Section 110, as of the lien date,\ntaking into account reductions in value due to damage, destruction, depreciation,\n\n                                            4\n\fobsolescence, removal of property, or other factors causing a decline in value.‖\nSection 110, subdivision (a) defines the term ―full cash value,‖ synonymously\nwith the term ―fair market value,‖ as ―the amount of cash or its equivalent that\nproperty would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in\nwhich neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other,\nand both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to\nwhich the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used, and of the\nenforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.‖\n       Most significantly for this case, the term ―real property‖ under section 51,\nsubdivision (d) (hereafter section 51(d)) is defined as ―that appraisal unit that\npersons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally\nvalued separately.‖ This definition echoes almost verbatim the definition\nrecommended by the Task Force Report. The statute does not further define\n―appraisal unit,‖ but the term is defined by regulation as ―a collection of assets that\nfunctions together, and that persons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as\na single unit or that is normally valued in the marketplace separately from other\nproperty . . . .‖ (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 324.)\n       In the wake of Proposition 13 and Proposition 8, and shortly before the\nenactment of section 51, the Board promulgated and then amended rule 461, a\nregulation applicable to most real property used for manufacturing. (Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 18, § 461 (Rule 461).) Rule 461, subdivision (e) (hereafter Rule 461(e))\nprovides: ―Declines in value will be determined by comparing the current lien\ndate full value of the appraisal unit to the indexed base year full value of the same\nunit for the current lien date. Land and improvements constitute an appraisal unit\nexcept when measuring declines in value caused by disaster, in which case land\nshall constitute a separate unit. For purposes of this subdivision, fixtures and other\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fmachinery and equipment classified as improvements constitute a separate\nappraisal unit.‖\n       At the same time that it adopted Rule 461(e)‘s classification of fixtures as\n―a separate appraisal unit,‖ the Board adopted two exceptions to this rule for\ncertain types of industrial property where land and fixtures were valued as a single\nunit in the marketplace: Rule 468, which applies to oil and gas properties, and\nRule 469, which applies to mining properties. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18,\n§§ 468, subd. (c)(6) (Rule 468), 469, subd. (e)(2)(C) (Rule 469).) Rule 473,\nadopted in 1995, similarly treats land and fixtures on geothermal properties as a\nsingle appraisal unit. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, §473(e)(4)(C) (Rule 473).)\nPetroleum refinery property was covered by Rule 461(e) until the Board‘s\nadoption of Rule 474.\n       In September 2006, the Board voted three to two to adopt Rule 474 to\naddress ―the valuation of the real property, personal property, and fixtures used for\nthe refining of petroleum.‖ (Rule 474, subd. (a).) Subdivision (b)(1) of Rule 474\nstates that ―[t]he unique nature of property used for the refining of petroleum\nrequires the application of specialized appraisal techniques designed to satisfy the\nrequirements of article XIII, section 1, and article XIII A, section 2, of the\nCalifornia Constitution. To this end, petroleum refineries and other real and\npersonal property associated therewith shall be valued pursuant to the principles\nand procedures set forth in this section.‖ Rule 474, subdivision (c)(2) states that\n― ‗[a]ppraisal unit‘ consists of the real and personal property that persons in the\nmarketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit.‖ Most pertinent here, subdivision\n(d) states that ―[f]or the purposes of this section: [¶] (1) Declines in value of\npetroleum refining properties will be determined by comparing the current lien\ndate full value of the appraisal unit [i.e., its value in an open market transaction] to\nthe indexed base year full value of the same unit [i.e., its Proposition 13 value].\n\n                                           6\n\f[¶] (2) The land, improvements, and fixtures and other machinery and equipment\nclassified as improvements for a petroleum refining property are rebuttably\npresumed to constitute a single appraisal unit . . . . [¶] (3) In rebutting this\npresumption, the assessor may consider evidence that: [¶] (A) The land and\nimprovements including fixtures and other machinery and equipment classified as\nimprovements are not under common ownership or control and do not typically\ntransfer in the marketplace as one economic unit; or, [¶] (B) When the fixtures\nand other machinery and equipment classified as improvements are not\nfunctionally and physically integrated with the realty and do not operate together\nas one economic unit.‖ (Italics added.)\n       The difference between treating fixtures as a separate appraisal unit (Rule\n461(e)) and treating fixtures and land together as a single appraisal unit (Rule 474)\nmay be illustrated by a hypothetical drawn from a Board staff report. (For brevity,\nwe will use the term ―land‖ to refer to land and ―non-fixture‖ improvements\nconsidered together unless otherwise indicated.) Suppose that following the\npurchase of a petroleum refinery property, the assessed value in ―Year 1‖ of the\nland is $2 million and the assessed value of the fixtures is $1 million. Now\nsuppose the land appreciates at $100,000 per year while the fixtures, when\nappraised separately, depreciate at $100,000 per year. Under Rule 461(e), the\ntreatment of fixtures as a separate appraisal unit means that the assessed value of\nthe fixtures will decline by $100,000 each year, while the land, though\nappreciating at $100,000 per year, will yield an assessed value that increases by\nonly 2 percent each year, the maximum increase allowed by Proposition 13. The\nresults are shown in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f                                            Assessed value\n           Year              Land               Fixtures              Total\n             1           $2,000,000            $1,000,000          $3,000,000\n             2           $2,040,000            $900,000            $2,940,000\n             3           $2,080,800            $800,000            $2,880,800\n             4           $2,122,416            $700,000            $2,822,416\n             5           $2,164,864            $600,000            $2,764,864\n             6           $2,208,162            $500,000            $2,708,162\n\n\n       By contrast, if land and fixtures were treated as a single appraisal unit under\nRule 474, the total assessed value of petroleum refinery property beyond Year 1\nwould be greater than the values shown above. When such property is treated as a\nsingle unit, fixture depreciation ($100,000 per year) may be offset by the full\namount of land appreciation ($100,000 per year), resulting in a total assessed value\nof $3 million each year. The total assessed value may be even greater than $3\nmillion beyond Year 1 (though no greater than a 2 percent annual increase) to the\nextent that fixture values decline by less than $100,000 per year when petroleum\nrefinery fixtures are bought and sold in the open market as a single unit with the\nunderlying land. Thus, owners of petroleum refinery property pay higher property\ntaxes under Rule 474 than under Rule 461(e).\n       Before adopting Rule 474, the Board held a hearing at which several public\nofficials testified in favor of the rule. Typical was the testimony of Rick\nAuerbach, the Los Angeles County Assessor, who stated that in his experience\n―refineries in California . . . are bought and sold as a unit. . . . I am not aware of\none that has not been sold as a unit. If we have a case where there is the potential\nfor a refinery to be dismantled and sold — where the fixtures are sold separately,\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fthe proposed rule is a rebuttable presumption and we would take that into account.\nAnd we would value the fixtures separately.‖\n       The Board concluded in its final statement of reasons before adopting the\nrule that ―sufficient evidence in the rulemaking record exists to determine that\nproposed Rule 474 is necessary to obtain assessments more accurately reflecting\nhow petroleum refinery properties would actually trade in the marketplace. . . . At\nthe June 27, 2006 Property Tax Committee meeting, Thomas Parker, Deputy\nCounty Counsel, Sacramento County; Rick Auerbach, Los Angeles County\nAssessor and President of the California Assessor‘s Association; Lance Howser,\nChief Assessor, Solano County; and Robert Quon, Director of Major Appraisals\nfor the Los Angeles County Assessor‘s office, all testified that refineries are in fact\nbought, sold, and valued as a single unit. In the same meeting, Mr. Auerbach\ntestified that refineries are different from other heavily-fixtured manufacturing\nindustries such as breweries, canneries, and amusement parks and toy\nmanufacturing. Refineries are unique in that up to 80 percent of their values are\ncontained in the fixtures and because the land and fixtures are so integrated, it is\ndifficult to physically separate the fixtures from the land. Further, the land and\nfixtures are also so economically integrated that a buyer normally would not, in a\nfair market transaction, purchase the land separately from the fixtures or the\nfixtures separately from the land. [¶] Since petroleum refineries are bought and\nsold as a unit consisting of land and fixtures, to value the fixtures separate and\napart from the land may result in assessed values either below or above fair market\nvalue in violation of Propositions 8 and 13.‖\n       Petroleum industry counsel submitted evidence to the Board, mostly in the\nform of for-sale advertisements and newspaper articles, showing that refinery\nfixtures are sometimes dismantled and sold separately.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f       In November 2007, the Office of Administrative Law approved the\nregulation, and it became effective in December 2007. In December 2008, WSPA\nfiled a complaint challenging Rule 474‘s validity, alleging four causes of action\nand seeking a declaration that (1) the Board violated the APA because Rule 474 is\ninconsistent with California Constitution article XIII A and section 51(d), and not\nnecessary to implement such law; (2) Rule 474 violates article XIII A‘s cap on\nyear-to-year increases in assessed value of real property; (3) Rule 474 violates\narticle XIII A‘s requirement of a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for raising real\nproperty taxes; and (4) Rule 474 violates petroleum refiners‘ constitutional right to\nequal protection and uniformity of laws.\n       In October 2009, the Board and WSPA filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. WSPA argued that Rule 474 violates section 51(d) and California\nConstitution article XIII A, and that the Board failed to provide an adequate\nstatement of economic impact as required by the APA. The trial court granted\nWSPA‘s summary judgment motion on both grounds, and the Court of Appeal\naffirmed on both grounds. We granted review.\n                                           II.\n       We first address the standard of review. Government Code section 15606,\nsubdivision (c) authorizes the Board to ―[p]rescribe rules and regulations to govern\nlocal boards of equalization when equalizing, and assessors when assessing . . . .‖\nFurther, the Board is empowered to ―[p]repare and issue instructions to assessors\ndesigned to promote uniformity throughout the state and its local taxing\njurisdictions in the assessment of property for the purposes of taxation.‖ (Id.,\nsubd. (e).) Such rules ―shall include, but are not limited to, rules, regulations,\ninstructions, and forms relating to classifications of kinds of property and\nevaluation procedures.‖ (Id., subd. (f).) As these provisions indicate, the orderly\nfunctioning of our property tax system depends on administrative regulations to\n\n                                           10\n\fimplement general statutory directives. The precise content of such regulations is\nneither mandated nor prohibited by statute and may depend on the application of\nstatutory principles to particular factual situations. Rule 474 is one such\nregulation arising from the Board‘s exercise of its quasi-legislative power to issue\ngenerally applicable and legally enforceable regulations pursuant to statutory\nauthorization. (See American Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality\nManagement Dist. (2012) 54 Cal.4th 446, 460 (American Coatings).)\n       As discussed below, the Board in promulgating Rule 474 was required not\nonly to interpret the relevant statute but also to evaluate whether the evidence\npresented to it was sufficient to warrant a special rule governing petroleum\nrefinery property. The latter task involves the exercise of the Board‘s discretion.\nJustice Kennard contends that Rule 474 was an interpretive and not a quasi-\nlegislative regulation, citing Carmona v. Division of Industrial Safety (1975) 13\nCal.3d 303, 309–310 (Carmona). (See conc. and dis. opn. by Kennard, J, post, at\npp. 8–9.) But Carmona is distinguishable because the agency there ―viewed the\nquestion before it as a matter involving the interpretation and application of an\nexisting regulation‖ and therefore was not making ―a quasi-legislative judgment\ndeclining to promulgate a new regulation.‖ (Carmona, at p. 310.) In issuing Rule\n474, the Board has clearly promulgated a new regulation applying to a specific\nclass of property and, in so doing, has made a quasi-legislative judgment based on\nits evaluation of the evidence as well as its understanding of the statute.\n       As our precedent has stated, ―quasi-legislative rules . . . represent[] an\nauthentic form of substantive lawmaking: Within its jurisdiction, the agency has\nbeen delegated the Legislature‘s lawmaking power. [Citations.] Because agencies\ngranted such substantive rulemaking power are truly ‗making law,‘ their quasi-\nlegislative rules have the dignity of statutes. When a court assesses the validity of\nsuch rules, the scope of its review is narrow. If satisfied that the rule in question\n\n                                          11\n\flay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the Legislature, and that it is\nreasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute, judicial review is at\nan end.‖ (Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th\n1, 10–11 (Yamaha); see Gov. Code, § 11342.2 [implementing regulations adopted\npursuant to statutory authorization must be ―consistent and not in conflict with the\nstatute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.‖].) When\na regulation is challenged on the ground that it is not ―reasonably necessary to\neffectuate the purpose of the statute,‖ our inquiry is confined to whether the rule is\narbitrary, capricious, or without rational basis (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 11\n& fn. 4) and whether substantial evidence supports the agency‘s determination that\nthe rule is reasonably necessary (Gov. Code, § 11350, subd. (b)(1)).\n       At the same time, when an implementing regulation is challenged on the\nground that it is ―in conflict with the statute‖ (Gov. Code, § 11342.2) or does not\n―lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the Legislature‖ (Yamaha,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 10), the issue of statutory construction is a question of law\non which a court exercises independent judgment. (See American Coatings,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 460.) In determining whether an agency has incorrectly\ninterpreted the statute it purports to implement, a court gives weight to the\nagency‘s construction. (See id. at p. 461 [―How much weight . . . is\n‗situational,‘ and greater weight may be appropriate when an agency has\na ‗ ―comparative interpretive advantage over the courts,‖ ‘ as when ‗ ―the legal\ntext to be interpreted is technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or entwined with\nissues of fact, policy, and discretion.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖].) ―Nevertheless, the proper\ninterpretation of a statute is ultimately the court‘s responsibility.‖ (Id. at p. 462.)\n                                          III.\n       Although WSPA contends that Rule 474 is arbitrary and unsupported by\nsubstantial evidence, its principal argument is that Rule 474 violates various\n\n                                           12\n\fstatutory and constitutional provisions. Notably, WSPA does not challenge Rule\n474 on the ground that its factual premise — that petroleum refinery land and\nfixtures are usually sold together — is somehow infirm. During the public\ncomment process, petroleum industry representatives submitted materials showing\nthat refinery fixtures are, on occasion, sold separately from the land. Consistent\nwith these materials, Rule 474 expressly acknowledges the possibility that refinery\nland and fixtures are not invariably sold as a unit: subdivision (d)(2) establishes a\nrebuttable presumption that refinery land and fixtures constitute a single appraisal\nunit, and subdivision (d)(3) describes the types of evidence that may rebut the\npresumption. Moreover, WSPA does not contend that it is burdensome to rebut\nthe presumption in situations where refinery land and fixtures are not sold,\ncontrolled, or operated as a single unit. WSPA‘s position is that even if refinery\nland and fixtures are generally sold as a single unit, the Board is statutorily and\nconstitutionally prohibited from appraising such land and fixtures as a single unit.\nWe apply independent judgment in resolving the issues of statutory and\nconstitutional interpretation before us.\n                                           A.\n       As noted, the constitutional mandate governing our real property tax system\nbefore Proposition 13 was that such property ―shall be assessed at the same\npercentage of fair market value.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII, § 1.) After the passage of\nProposition 13 and Proposition 8, the California Constitution now provides: ―The\nfull cash value base may reflect from year to year the inflationary rate not to\nexceed 2 percent for any given year or reduction as shown in the consumer price\nindex or comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction, or may be reduced\nto reflect substantial damage, destruction, or other factors causing a decline in\nvalue.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 2, subd. (b).) So, while there is a cap on the\nassessed value of property when its fair market value has appreciated, the assessed\n\n                                           13\n\fvalue of property remains its fair market value when that value has fallen. (See\nState Bd. of Equalization v. Board of Supervisors (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 813,\n822–823 [Board rule enacted after Proposition 13 but before Proposition 8\ndisallowing ―actual market value depreciation‖ is inconsistent with article XIII,\nsection 1].) Rule 474‘s market-based approach to determining the proper appraisal\nunit for petroleum refinery property ensures that reductions in property values are\nmeasured according to fair market value. Thus, Rule 474 appears consistent with\narticles XIII and XIII A.\n       Rule 474 is also consistent with section 51(d). As noted, section 51(d)\nstates: ―For purposes of this section, ‗real property‘ means that appraisal unit that\npersons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally\nvalued separately.‖ By its terms, the statute provides two alternative methods of\ndetermining the appraisal unit that constitutes taxable real property: it is either\n(1) a unit ―that persons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit‖ or\n(2) a unit ―that is normally valued separately.‖ Rule 474 applies the first method\nto petroleum refinery property.\n       The Court of Appeal rejected this straightforward reading of section 51(d).\nRelying on legislative history, it opined that ―the Legislature, in enacting the\nsection, did not intend to approve the use of two, alternative and disjunctive\ndefinitions of appraisal units of real property at the sole discretion of [the Board].\nInstead, the Legislature was acknowledging that the then-existing valuation\nformulas contemplated valuing land and improvements as an appraisal unit, and\nvaluing fixtures as a separate appraisal unit to allow for depreciation, and it\nintended that these valuation formulas would carry forward under Prop. 13 and\nProp. 8, particularly in the absence of evidence of any change in circumstances\njustifying a change in valuation formulas. Giving such a meaning to section 51(d)\nmakes sense when its historical context is remembered. In its effort to implement\n\n                                          14\n\fProp. 13 and Prop. 8 in accord with the voters‘ intent, the Legislature reasonably\nconcluded that it was important that the valuation formulas existing before the\nvoters spoke would remain the same under the new tax system established by the\nvoters. In short, the voters‘ conception of ‗real property‘ as it was defined and\nvalued would remain the same under the new real property tax system as it was\nunder the prior real property tax system in order to assure that the restrictions\nimposed on real property taxes would actually result in realized restrictions on real\nproperty taxes. The Legislature well reasoned that, if the manner in which real\nproperty was understood and valued did not remain constant in the transition from\nthe prior real property tax system to the new real property tax system, then the\nvoters‘ intended goal of restricting real property taxes might prove elusive. [The\nBoard‘s] interpretation of section 51(d) essentially discards the statute‘s intent to\nfix in place the pre-Prop. 13 and Prop. 8 valuation formulas for real property.\nInstead, [the Board] would interpret section 51(d) to allow for the adoption of new\nvaluation formulas by which the framework governing real property could be\nmanipulated to avoid the restrictions on real property taxes imposed by the voters\nwhen they approved Prop. 13 and Prop. 8.‖\n       There is no dispute that section 51(d)‘s definition of a taxable ―appraisal\nunit‖ was intended to promote continuity in valuation practices before and after\nthe passage of Proposition 13 and Proposition 8. The Task Force Report, which\nrecommended the two alternative concepts of an appraisal unit codified in section\n51(d), explained that ―the purpose of Prop. 13 was to place a cap on the value of\nproperty in any one year, while Prop. 8 sought to allow values to rise and fall to\nany point below this cap, should actual market values so dictate. [¶] The purpose\nof the ‗appraisal unit‘ concept is to ensure that these increases or declines in value\nbe measured in the same manner as such property was appraised prior to Prop.\n13.‖ (Task Force Rep., supra, at p. 31, italics added.)\n\n                                          15\n\f       What is disputed is how real property was appraised prior to Proposition\n13. WSPA and the Court of Appeal contend that in the case of industrial property,\nland and fixtures have historically been appraised separately and that section\n51(d)‘s ―normally valued separately‖ language was intended to codify this\npractice. According to the Court of Appeal, ―assessors for many years leading up\nto the late 1970‘s assessed the value of land and improvements as one appraisal\nunit, and assessed the value of fixtures as a separate appraisal unit in order to\naccount for depreciation. And, it appears from the appellate record that while the\nowner of a manufacturing or industrial property may have received a single real\nproperty tax bill each year, the bill would have been the reflection of an assessed\nvalue for land and improvements, and an assessed value for fixtures. The total\nassessed value of the real property would then be computed by adding the two\ndistinct appraisal units, with the ad valorem real property tax then imposed on the\ntotal assessed value. As a result of the practice of applying these separate\nappraisal units valuation formulas, the value of the fixture-related appraisal unit of\nan industrial or manufacturing property would, in the absence of the addition of\nnew fixtures, decline each year to reflect depreciation. This means that the\namount of real property taxes attributable to fixtures would also decline.‖\n       The Court of Appeal, however, appears to have confused assessment with\nvaluation. Constitutional and statutory provisions have long required land and\nimprovements to be assessed separately, with improvements in this context\nincluding fixtures. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, § 13; §§ 105, 602, 607.) This principle\nwas explained in Mahoney v. City of San Diego (1926) 198 Cal. 388, where an\nassessor arbitrarily valued improvements separately from land and thereby\nsystematically undervalued the improvements, apparently to encourage\ndevelopment. This court recognized that in order to comply with constitutional\nand statutory requirements that ―improved and unimproved real estate shall have a\n\n                                          16\n\funiform basis of valuation, it was essential that the valuations to be placed upon\nland and upon the improvements thereon, whether in the form of buildings or\ncrops or trees, should be separately set forth in the making of assessments\nthereon.‖ (Id. at p. 399.) But we made clear that the constitutional and statutory\nprovisions requiring separate assessments ―do not refer to the valuations to be\nplaced upon these two classes of taxable property, but merely to the fact that the\nvaluations thereof fixed by the assessor in conformity with the other provisions of\nthe constitution and statutes relating to the basis of the assessment of property\nvalues shall be separately stated by him in his assessment-books.‖ (Ibid., italics\nadded.) We thus rejected the assessor‘s interpretation of the relevant\nconstitutional and statutory provisions to mean that he was required to appraise\nimprovements as if they were ―physical[ly] separat[ed] from the real estate upon\nwhich [they] stood.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Thus, the fact that separate assessments for land and fixtures appear on a\nproperty tax bill is not evidence of separate appraisal of those components of real\nproperty. The requirement of separate assessments was never intended to supplant\nthe market-based approach to determining the proper appraisal unit, and this\ndistinction has long been recognized in practice. (See Bd. of Equalization,\nAssessors Handbook, Appraisal of Urban Real Estate (2d ed. 1958) Appraisal\nProcess, p. 5 (1958 Assessors Handbook) [―Valuation of improved property as a\nunit does not conflict with provisions of State law requiring values of land and\nimprovements to be separately entered on the assessment roll. The legal\nprovisions do not require the separate appraisal of land and improvements but\nmerely that the valuations of each shall be separately stated on the assessment\nroll.‖]; Bd. of Equalization, Assessors‘ Handbook, General Appraisal Manual\n(1966) Economics of Value, p. 16 (1966 Assessors‘ Handbook) [―For purposes of\nassessment, the law requires a separate assessment of land, improvements, and\n\n                                         17\n\fpersonal property. But statutes do not require separate appraisals of these different\nclasses of property.‖]; Bd. of Equalization, Assessors‘ Handbook, General\nAppraisal Manual (1975) Market Value Concept, p. 13 (1975 Assessors‘\nHandbook) [same].)\n       As the Task Force Report indicates, the Legislature enacted section 51(d)\non the understanding that real property values may ―rise and fall . . . [to] any point\nbelow [the Proposition 13] cap, should actual market values so dictate.‖ (Task\nForce Rep., supra, at p. 31.) Rule 474 furthers the long-standing mandate to\nappraise real property according to ―actual market values,‖ and the evidence in the\nrecord shows that Rule 474‘s market-based approach to determining the proper\nappraisal unit was in fact the traditional method for making such determinations\nbefore Proposition 13. The 1966 Assessors‘ Handbook makes this clear: ―It is\nobvious that market value necessarily involves a unit as well as a price.\nConsequently, no discussion of market value is complete unless there is some\nanalysis of the unit to be valued. It seems to be clear that, since the objective is\nmarket value, the proper unit to be valued is a unit that is dealt in by the market,\ni.e., one that people buy and sell. Any fraction of this unit involves artificiality.‖\n(1966 Assessors‘ Handbook, supra, at pp. 15–16.) The 1975 Assessors Handbook\nsimilarly states: ―Since the appraisal objective is to estimate market value, the\nproper unit to be valued is the unit that people in the market buy and sell.‖ (1975\nAssessors‘ Handbook, supra, at p. 12.) If ―[t]he unit typically dealt in by the\nmarket is the combination of land and building,‖ then ―the combination is the\nlogical appraisal unit from an economic point of view.‖ (Ibid.; see also 1958\nAssessors Handbook, supra, at p. 5 [―It is well recognized that the sum of the\nvalue estimates of fractional parts of a property is not necessarily equal to the\nvalue of the whole, and that values of land and improvements are not independent\nof each other. It follows, therefore, that improved realty must be valued as a\n\n                                          18\n\funit.‖].) Thus, Rule 474 is fully consistent with the Legislature‘s objective ―to\nensure that . . . declines in value [are] measured in the same manner as such\nproperty was appraised prior to Prop. 13.‖ (Task Force Rep., supra, at p. 31.)\nBefore and after Proposition 13, actual market value has guided the appraisal of\nreal property in the declining value context.\n       WSPA notes that Rule 461(e), promulgated just before the enactment of\nsection 51(d), ―has expressly segregated land and fixtures for decline-in-value\npurposes since 1979‖ and contends that ―the Board has historically interpreted\n[section 51(d)‘s] ‗normally valued separately‘ language as codifying Rule 461(e).‖\nBut contemporaneous with its adoption of Rule 461(e), the Board also adopted\nRule 468 (oil and gas properties) and Rule 469 (mining properties), which treat\nland and fixtures as a single appraisal unit based on marketplace realities. Further,\nin 1995, the Board adopted Rule 473, which similarly treats land and fixtures on\ngeothermal properties as a single appraisal unit. Thus, the Board has not\ninterpreted section 51(d) to codify a rule that fixtures must always be treated as a\nseparate appraisal unit in the declining value context or that the treatment of land\nand fixtures as a single unit is limited only to the exceptions that existed when\nsection 51(d) was enacted.\n       WSPA cites no other evidence that section 51(d) was intended to codify\nRule 461(e), and we are aware of none. It is true that section 51(d)‘s alternative\nconceptions of ―appraisal unit‖ — what ―persons in the marketplace commonly\nbuy and sell as a unit‖ and what ―is normally valued separately‖ — indicate that\nthe Board has leeway to define an appraisal unit by reference to customary\nappraisal practices when, for example, there is little market information about how\na particular type of property is bought or sold. But there is no indication that the\nLegislature intended the Board to be forever bound by the conception of ―appraisal\nunit‖ it formulated in 1979, even when the Board later has substantial evidence\n\n                                          19\n\fthat separate appraisal of land and fixtures does not reflect how a particular type of\nproperty is traded in the marketplace. To the extent that Rule 461(e) informs the\nmeaning of section 51(d), it was undisputed during this rulemaking that Rule\n461(e) itself, consistent with historic appraisal practices, reflected a marketplace\njudgment that land and fixtures for industrial property are typically bought and\nsold separately, and therefore should be appraised separately. In adopting a\ndifferent method for appraising petroleum refinery property on the ground that\nsuch property is typically bought and sold as a single unit, the Board followed,\nrather than departed from, the marketplace approach underlying Rule 461(e) as\nwell as Rules 468, 469, and 473. Although WSPA contends that petroleum\nrefinery property more closely resembles properties covered by Rule 461(e) than\nproperties covered by Rules 468, 469, or 473, there is substantial evidence in the\nrecord that land and fixtures on petroleum refinery property are uniquely\nintegrated, that fixtures represent an unusually high proportion of the value of such\nproperty, and that petroleum refinery land and fixtures are usually sold as a single\nunit. (See ante, at pp. 8–9.)\n       Rule 474 thus represents no change in the method of determining the\nappropriate appraisal unit. In adopting this exception to Rule 461(e) for petroleum\nrefinery property, the Board sought to align the concept of ―appraisal unit‖ with\nthe settled rule that when real property declines in value, it should be appraised\naccording to its actual market value. There is no evidence that section 51(d) was\nintended to freeze or codify the treatment of industrial fixtures as a separate\nappraisal unit. Rule 474 comports with section 51(d), which defines taxable ―real\nproperty‖ in one of its formulations as ―that appraisal unit that persons in the\nmarketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit.‖\n       Finally, WSPA contends there are other types of industrial property that are\nsimilarly integrated with the land and have a comparably high proportion of\n\n                                          20\n\fproperty value derived from fixtures. To prevail against this argument, the Board\nneed only establish that Rule 474 is not arbitrary, capricious, or without a rational\nbasis. (See Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at pp. 10–11.) Under this standard, the\nBoard need not extend the rule to all other comparable types of industrial property\nor show that petroleum refinery property is entirely unique. (See U.S. Cellular\nCorp. v. F.C.C. (D.C. Cir. 2001) 254 F.3d 78, 86 [Regulatory ―agencies need not\naddress all problems ‗in one fell swoop,‘ [citations][.] ‗Reform may take place\none step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most\nacute to the [regulatory] mind.[]‘ ‖].) It is enough that the Board has reached a\nrational conclusion, based on substantial evidence, that petroleum refinery\nproperty is sufficiently different from most industrial property to warrant appraisal\nof land and fixtures as a single unit. (See ante, at pp. 8–9.)\n                                          B.\n       Apart from its contention that Rule 474 is inconsistent with section 51(d),\nWSPA argues that Rule 474 has the effect of taxing unrealized increases in land\nvalue in violation of Proposition 13: ―Proposition 13 allows the reassessment of\nland, in whole or in part, under only three circumstances: a change in ownership,\nnew construction, and a capped inflation adjustment. Rule 474, however, allows\nunrealized increases in land and improvements value, not assessable under\nProp. 13, to offset actual declines in fixture value resulting from depreciation even\nif none of the three exceptions occur. In so doing, Rule 474 violates a central tenet\nof Prop. 13 . . . by allowing land value in excess of the base-year value cap on land\nto be assessed.‖\n       This argument fails, however, because Proposition 13 does not specifically\ncap the taxable value of land or improvements per se. Instead, Proposition 13 caps\ngrowth in ―the appraised value of real property‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 2,\nsubd. (a), italics added), which in this context encompasses land, improvements,\n\n                                          21\n\fand fixtures (§§ 104, 105). To say that Rule 474 violates Proposition 13 by\nallowing taxation of unrealized land value above the Proposition 13 cap is to\nassume that land, by itself, must be treated as a separate appraisal unit for purposes\nof real property taxation. But, as explained above, no constitutional or statutory\nprovision precludes the Board from treating land and fixtures as a single appraisal\nunit when substantial evidence indicates that a particular type of property is\nbought and sold as a single unit in the marketplace.\n       Further, WSPA contends that Rule 474 violates the Legislature‘s mandate,\nenacted pursuant to Proposition 13, that the ―full cash value‖ of real property\n―tak[e] into account reductions in value due to . . . depreciation . . . .‖ (§ 51(a)(2).)\nAccording to WSPA, because the fair market value of petroleum refinery property\nconsidered as a single unit masks the value of fixture depreciation considered by\nitself, Rule 474‘s treatment of land and fixtures as a single appraisal unit violates\nthe requirement to account for depreciation in determining full cash value.\n       However, Rule 474 does ―tak[e] into account reductions in value due to . . .\ndepreciation‖ in determining the ―full cash value‖ of petroleum refinery property.\n(§ 51(a)(2).) Section 51(a)(2) refers to ―full cash value, as defined in Section\n110,‖ and section 110 defines ―full cash value‖ (and, synonymously, ―full market\nvalue‖) to mean, with exceptions not relevant here, ―the amount of cash or its\nequivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under\nconditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies\nof the other, and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses\nand purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being\nused, and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.‖ By\nfocusing on the value of property ―if exposed for sale in the open market‖ in a fair\nand transparent transaction, the definition of ―full cash value‖ contemplates that\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\fappraisal of real property will reflect the economic reality of how a particular type\nof property is actually bought and sold.\n       For property whose fixtures are typically sold separately in the open\nmarket, fixtures are properly treated as a separate appraisal unit, and fixture\ndepreciation may be independently recognized. But when land and fixtures are\ntypically sold as a single unit, they are properly treated as a single appraisal unit,\neven if fixture depreciation is offset by land appreciation or otherwise reduced by\nvaluing land and fixtures together. Indeed, consistent with the emphasis on\nmarketplace realities in the Assessors‘ Handbooks cited earlier (see ante, at\npp. 17–18), we recognized in Mahoney that ―in common knowledge and\nexperience,‖ the actual market value of improvements is often ―dependent upon\nthe location‖ and cannot accurately be determined by separating improvements\nfrom the underlying land. (Mahoney, supra, 198 Cal. at pp. 401–402.) To account\nfor fixture depreciation separately when land and fixtures are actually bought and\nsold as a single unit would allow the owner to claim a reduction in real property\nvalue that is economically fictitious, resulting in a tax windfall. Neither California\nConstitution article XIII A nor section 51 nor traditional appraisal practices\nrequire the unit of appraisal to be defined in a manner that maximizes the\ndepreciation of fixtures in contravention of economic reality. To the contrary, the\nlaw and consistent practice have long required appraisal of real property in the\ndeclining value context to reflect its ―full cash value‖ — that is, the value\n―property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market.‖ (§§ 51(a)(2), 110.)\nRule 474 is consistent with this principle.\n                                           C.\n       WSPA also contends that Rule 474 violates the constitutional prohibition\non tax increases without a two-thirds vote of the each house of the Legislature.\nCalifornia Constitution article XIII A, section 3, subdivision (a) (hereafter article\n\n                                           23\n\fXIII A section 3(a)) provides: ―Any change in state statute which results in any\ntaxpayer paying a higher tax must be imposed by an act passed by not less than\ntwo-thirds of all members elected to each of the two houses of the Legislature,\nexcept that no new ad valorem taxes on real property, or sales or transaction taxes\non the sales of real property may be imposed.‖ WSPA argues that because the\nadoption of Rule 474 results in a higher tax bill for at least some petroleum\nrefinery owners, it violates the two-thirds voting requirement.\n       By its terms, article XIII A section 3(a) applies only to a ―change in state\nstatute which results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax.‖ (Italics added.) It does\nnot apply to an agency‘s decision to modify an administrative rule in response to\nsubstantial evidence that such modification is reasonably necessary to faithfully\nimplement an existing statute. The Court of Appeal‘s decision in River Garden\nRetirement Home v. Franchise Tax Bd. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 922 is instructive.\nThere, the taxpayer argued that the Franchise Tax Board enacted a tax increase\nwithin the meaning of article XIII A, section 3(a) when it adopted a policy of\ndisallowing certain dividend deductions so as to conform to statutory and case\nlaw. Rejecting this argument, the court said: ―Section 3 . . . by its terms and\naccording to the overall aim of the initiative applies only to revenue increasing\nenactments. The FTB is charged with administering and enforcing our franchise\nand income tax laws. It does not have taxing powers. . . . . It did not ‗enact‘\nanything within the meaning of article XIII A, section 3.‖ (Id. at pp. 949–950.)\n       The Board here is similarly charged with administering and enforcing the\nstate‘s property tax laws and has no taxing power. Article XIII A, section 3(a)\ndoes not prevent the Board from exercising its statutorily delegated authority to\npromote uniform assessment practices by revising its own rules regarding\nappraisal units to more closely reflect the actual market value of real property.\nThe Board has no power to determine tax rates or to extend the scope of a tax to\n\n                                         24\n\fitems previously untaxed. (Cf. AB Cellular LA, LLC v. City of Los Angeles (2007)\n150 Cal.App.4th 747, 760–761 [extension of cell phone tax to usage previously\nuntaxed is a tax increase requiring voter approval].) The Board‘s power pursuant\nto Government Code section 15606 is limited to prescribing methods of assessing\nproperty and related matters in order to implement the tax statutes; these are well-\nrecognized administrative functions. (See Hahn v. State Bd. of Equalization\n(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 985, 997.) In sum, the Board‘s modification of its own\npost-Proposition 13 rules to more accurately appraise a class of property is not a\ntax increase resulting from a ―change in state statute‖ under article XIII A, section\n3(a).\n                                         III.\n        In addition to challenging Rule 474‘s substantive validity, WSPA contends\nthat the adoption of the rule was procedurally deficient because the Board failed to\nadequately assess the economic impact of the regulation as required by the APA.\nIn addressing this issue, we begin with a brief review of the APA.\n                                          A.\n        ―The APA is intended to advance ‗meaningful public participation in the\nadoption of administrative regulations by state agencies‘ and create ‗an\nadministrative record assuring effective judicial review.‘ [Citation.] In order to\ncarry out these dual objectives, the APA (1) establishes ‗basic minimum\nprocedural requirements for the adoption, amendment or repeal of administrative\nregulations‘ (Gov. Code, § 11346) which give ‗interested parties an opportunity to\npresent statements and arguments at the time and place specified in the notice and\ncalls upon the agency to consider all relevant matter presented to it,‘ and\n(2) ‗provides that any interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to the\nvalidity of any regulation by bringing an action for declaratory relief in the\nsuperior court.‘ [Citation.] The APA was born out of the Legislature‘s perception\n\n                                          25\n\fthere existed too many regulations imposing greater than necessary burdens on the\nstate and particularly upon small businesses.‖ (Voss v. Superior Court (1996) 46\nCal.App.4th 900, 908–909.)\n       To effectuate these goals, the APA provides that every agency subject to\nthe APA that proposes to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation is required to submit\na notice of the proposed action to the Office of Administrative Law for review,\nand to make the notice available to the public upon request. (Gov. Code, §§\n11346.2, 11346.5, subd. (a).) The notice must contain ―a copy of the express\nterms of the proposed regulation‖ as well as ―an initial statement of reasons for\nproposing the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation.‖ (Id., § 11346.2,\nsubds. (a), (b).) This initial statement of reasons must include ―[a] statement of\nthe specific purpose of each adoption, amendment, or repeal‖ and ―[a] description\nof reasonable alternatives to the regulation and the agency‘s reasons for rejecting\nthose alternatives.‖ (Id., § 11346.2, subd. (b)(1), (5)(A).) The initial statement of\nreasons also must include ―[f]acts, evidence, documents, testimony, or other\nevidence on which the agency relies to support an initial determination that the\naction will not have a significant adverse economic impact on businesses.‖ (Id.,\n§ 11346.2, subd. (b)(6)(A).) We examine the economic impact assessment\nrequirement in detail below.\n       The notice of proposed action is followed by a public comment period.\nUnder Government Code section 11346.8, the agency may hold a public hearing at\nwhich ―both oral and written statements, arguments, or contentions, shall be\npermitted. . . . If a public hearing is not scheduled, the state agency shall . . .\nafford any interested person or his or her duly authorized representative, the\nopportunity to present statements, arguments or contentions in writing.‖\nGovernment Code section 11346.5, subdivision (a)(15) provides that the notice of\nproposed action must specify ―[t]he date by which comments submitted in writing\n\n                                           26\n\fmust be received to present statements, arguments, or contentions in writing\nrelating to the proposed action in order for them to be considered by the state\nagency before it adopts, amends, or repeals a regulation.‖ ―In addition, a public\nhearing shall be held if, no later than 15 days prior to the close of the written\ncomment period, an interested person or his or her duly authorized representative\nsubmits in writing to the state agency, a request to hold a public hearing.‖ (Gov.\nCode, § 11346.8, subd. (a).)\n       After the public comment period, if the agency decides to enact the\nregulation, it must prepare a ―final statement of reasons‖ for adopting the proposed\nrule, which must include ―[a]n update of the information contained in the initial\nstatement of reasons.‖ (Gov. Code, § 11346.9, subd. (a)(1).) ―If the update\nidentifies any data or any technical, theoretical or empirical study, report, or\nsimilar document on which the agency is relying in proposing the adoption,\namendment, or repeal of a regulation that was not identified in the initial statement\nof reasons, or which was otherwise not identified or made available for public\nreview prior to the close of the public comment period,‖ then the agency must\nmake such document available to those participating in the public comment period\nat least 15 days before adoption of the proposed rule, and the agency must permit\nand respond to comments regarding that document, pursuant to Government Code\nsection 11347.1. (Gov. Code, § 11346.9, subd. (a)(1).) The final statement of\nreasons must also include ―[a] summary of each objection or recommendation\nmade regarding the specific adoption, amendment, or repeal proposed, together\nwith an explanation of how the proposed action has been changed to accommodate\neach objection or recommendation, or the reasons for making no change.‖ (Gov.\nCode, § 11346.9, subd. (a)(3).)\n       Once the regulation is adopted, ―[a]ny interested person may obtain a\njudicial declaration as to [its] validity . . . by bringing an action for declaratory\n\n                                           27\n\frelief in the superior court . . . .‖ (Gov. Code, § 11350, subd. (a).) ―Failure to\ncomply with every procedural facet of the APA, however, does not automatically\ninvalidate a regulation. A court may declare the regulation invalid only for . . .\n‗substantial failure‘ to comply with the act. (Gov. Code, § 11350, subd. (a).)\n‗ ― ‗Substantial compliance, as the phrase is used in the decisions, means actual\ncompliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of\nthe statute.‘ . . . Where there is compliance as to all matters of substance technical\ndeviations are not to be given the stature of noncompliance . . . . Substance\nprevails over form.‖ ‘ ‖ (Pulaski v. Occupational Safety & Health Stds. Bd. (1999)\n75 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1328.)\n                                          B.\n       We turn now to consider whether the Board‘s economic impact assessment\nin this case was sufficient to comply with the APA. Several statutory provisions\naddress an agency‘s obligation to assess the economic impact of a new regulation.\nAs noted, an agency‘s initial statement of reasons for proposing a regulation must\ninclude ―[f]acts, evidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence on which the\nagency relies to support an initial determination that the action will not have a\nsignificant adverse economic impact on businesses.‖ (Gov. Code, § 11346.2,\nsubd. (b)(6)(A).) In addition, Government Code section 11346.5 subdivision\n(a)(8) provides: ―If a state agency, in adopting, amending, or repealing any\nadministrative regulation, makes an initial determination that the action will not\nhave a significant, statewide adverse economic impact directly affecting business,\nincluding the ability of California businesses to compete with businesses in other\nstates, it shall make a declaration to that effect in the notice of proposed action. In\nmaking this declaration, the agency shall provide in the record facts, evidence,\ndocuments, testimony, or other evidence upon which the agency relies to support\nits initial determination. [¶] An agency‘s initial determination and declaration\n\n                                          28\n\fthat a proposed adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation may have or will\nnot have a significant, adverse impact on businesses, including the ability of\nCalifornia businesses to compete with businesses in other states, shall not be\ngrounds for the office to refuse to publish the notice of proposed action.‖ A\nregulation may be declared invalid if ―[t]he agency declaration pursuant to\nparagraph (8) of subdivision (a) of Section 11346.5 is in conflict with substantial\nevidence in the record.‖ (Id., § 11350, subd. (b)(2).)\n       Further, Government Code section 11346.5, subdivision (a)(9) provides\nthat the notice of proposed action shall include ―[a] description of all cost impacts,\nknown to the agency at the time the notice of proposed action is submitted to the\noffice, that a representative private person or business would necessarily incur in\nreasonable compliance with the proposed action. [¶] If no cost impacts are known\nto the agency, it shall state the following: [¶] ‗The agency is not aware of any\ncost impacts that a representative private person or business would necessarily\nincur in reasonable compliance with the proposed action.‘ ‖ Government Code\nsection 11346.5, subdivision (c) states: ―This section shall not be construed in any\nmanner that results in the invalidation of a regulation because of the alleged\ninadequacy of the notice content or the summary or cost estimates, or the alleged\ninadequacy or inaccuracy of the housing cost estimates, if there has been\nsubstantial compliance with those requirements.‖\n       The obligation of agencies to assess the economic impacts of their proposed\nregulations is also addressed in Government Code, section 11346.3. ―State\nagencies proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal any administrative regulation shall\nassess the potential for adverse economic impact on California business\nenterprises and individuals, avoiding the imposition of unnecessary or\nunreasonable regulations or reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance\nrequirements.‖ (Gov. Code, § 11346.3, subd. (a).) Furthermore, ―[t]he proposed\n\n                                          29\n\fadoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation shall be based on adequate\ninformation concerning the need for, and consequences of, proposed governmental\naction.‖ (Id., § 11346.3, subd. (a)(1).)\n       The Court of Appeal in California Assn. of Medicals Product Suppliers v.\nMaxwell-Jolly (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 286 (Maxwell-Jolly) extensively discussed\nthe economic impact assessment required by the APA. There, the court rejected\nthe state agency‘s argument that in its initial determination of economic impact, it\nis obliged only to ―consider‖ the proposal‘s impact and may rely solely on its\n―beliefs.‖ (Id. at p. 305.) ―[M]ere speculative belief is not sufficient to support an\nagency declaration of its initial determination about economic impact . . . .‖ (Id. at\npp. 305–306.) Rather, ―the agency must provide in the record any ‗ ―facts,\nevidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence‖ ‘ upon which it relies for its\ninitial determination. (Gov. Code, §§ 11346.5, subd. (a)(8), 11347.3, subd.\n(b)(4).) . . . . An agency specifically must ‗assess‘ the potential adverse economic\nimpact on California business and individuals of a proposed regulation (Gov.\nCode, § 11346.3) and declare in the notice of proposed action any ‗initial\ndetermination that the action will not have a significant statewide adverse\neconomic impact directly affecting business.‘ (Gov. Code, § 11346.5, subd.\n(a)(8).) These provisions plainly call for an evaluation based on facts.‖ (Maxwell-\nJolly, at p. 306.)\n       At the same time, Maxwell-Jolly emphasized that ―a regulation is not\nnecessarily invalid, even if it has a significant adverse economic impact on\nbusiness. Government Code section 11346.3 only requires that ‗agencies . . .\nassess the potential for adverse economic impact on California business\nenterprises and individuals, avoiding the imposition of unnecessary or\nunreasonable regulations or reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance\nrequirements.‘ (Gov. Code, § 11346.3, subd. (a), italics added.) Thus, regulations\n\n                                           30\n\fmay have negative economic impacts if necessary or reasonable under the\ncircumstances.‖ (Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 306.)\n       Maxwell-Jolly further explained that ―the reference to a ‗determination‘ in\nGovernment Code section 11346.5, subdivision (a)(8) states merely that if an\nagency makes an ‗initial determination that the action will not have a significant,\nstatewide adverse economic impact directly affecting business . . . it shall make a\ndeclaration to that effect in the notice of proposed action.‘ (Gov. Code,\n§ 11346.5, subd. (a)(8), italics added.) The qualifying adjective ‗initial‘ indicates\nthe agency‘s determination need not be conclusive, and the qualifying adjective\n‗significant‘ indicates that the agency need not assess or declare all adverse\neconomic impact anticipated.‖ (Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 307.)\n       ―Given these factors,‖ the Maxwell-Jolly court said, ―we conclude the\nDepartment‘s obligation in its initial determination was to make an initial showing\nthat there was some factual basis for the Department‘s decision. We review the\nDepartment‘s initial determination to determine that the Department has\nsubstantially complied with its obligations, and whether it is supported by some\nsubstantial evidence.‖ (Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 307.)\n       We agree with the Maxwell-Jolly court‘s understanding of what the\nrequirement of an initial economic impact assessment entails. The requirement is\nintended to ensure that such information is provided early in the rulemaking\nprocess and then refined based on public comment and further consideration in the\nlater stages. Specifically, an economic impact assessment of a proposed\nregulation has three phases. First, the agency makes an initial, provisional\ndetermination of whether the proposed rule will have a significant adverse\neconomic impact on businesses. Second, during the public comment period,\naffected parties may comment on the agency‘s initial determination and supply\nadditional information relevant to the issue. Third, when the agency issues its\n\n                                          31\n\ffinal decision and statement of reasons, it must respond to the public comments\nand either change its proposal in response to the comments or explain why it has\nnot.\n       We also agree with Maxwell-Jolly and with the Board that an agency‘s\ninitial determination of economic impact need not exhaustively examine the\nsubject or involve extensive data collection. The agency is required only to ―make\nan initial showing that there was some factual basis for [its] determination.‖\n(Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.4th at p. 307.) Moreover, inferences and\nprojections that are ― ‗the product of logic and reason‘ ‖ may provide a valid basis\nfor an initial determination of economic impact. (Id. at p. 308.) And a regulation\nwill not be invalidated simply because of disagreement over the strict accuracy of\ncost estimates on which the agency relied to support its initial determination. (See\nGov. Code, § 11346.5, subd. (c) [regulation may not be invalidated ―if there has\nbeen substantial compliance with [initial notice] requirements‖].)\n       Even under this deferential standard, however, we agree with WSPA and\nthe courts below that the Board‘s initial determination that Rule 474 would not\nhave a significant adverse impact on businesses did not substantially comply with\nthe APA. The Board relied on a 2006 document titled ―Revenue Estimate‖\nconcerning proposed Rule 474. According to the document, which was prepared\nby Board staff, WSPA reported that there are 20 major refineries located in\nCalifornia, with five in Los Angeles County and four in Contra Costa County.\n(Bd. of Equalization, Revenue Estimates, Issue No. 6-001 (June 7, 2006) p. 2.)\nCounty data indicated that the total assessment in these two counties was over $14\nbillion, with about 80 percent of that value enrolled as fixtures. Projecting figures\nstatewide, the Board staff estimated that there was $32 billion of refinery property,\nof which $25 billion consisted of fixtures and $7 billion in land and non-fixture\nimprovements. To ―conservatively estimate[]‖ the incremental amount of taxable\n\n                                         32\n\fassessed value resulting from the proposed rule, the Board staff multiplied the $7\nbillion in land value by a 2 percent appreciation factor to conclude that Rule 474\nwould yield ―at least $140 million‖ in additional assessed value. (Id. at p. 3.) The\nBoard staff then multiplied $140 million by the 1 percent tax on real property\npermitted under article XIII A to arrive at $1.4 million as the annual estimated\nrevenue effect of Rule 474, while acknowledging that ―[t]he actual revenue effect\ncould be considerably higher or lower depending on the number of properties\n[affected] and the actual amount of offsetting values.‖ (Ibid.) Based on these\ncalculations, the Board concluded that Rule 474 ―will not have a significant\nadverse economic impact on businesses.‖\n       The trial court observed that even after extended oral argument, it was\n―utterly unable to understand why this calculation is correct as a measure of\nincreased taxes from treating refineries as a single assessment unit for decline in\nvalue purposes. Even as a theoretical matter, surely there should be some\nquantification of the effect of depreciation of fixtures on assessed value.‖ The\nCourt of Appeal similarly stated that the Board‘s analysis failed to provide ―an\neconomic impact based on data concerning fixture depreciation on assessed\nvalues‖ and thus ―leaves a reader without an understanding of what the taxes on a\nrepresentative refinery would have been under the formerly applicable Rule\n461(e), and what the taxes would be under the new rule Rule 474(d)(2).‖\n       We agree. Even assuming the Board could reasonably project $32 billion\nas the total value of 20 refineries statewide based on data showing $14 billion as\nthe total value of nine refineries in two counties, the Board‘s analysis offers no\nexplanation why multiplying $7 billion in land value by a 2 percent appreciation\nfactor is, empirically or conceptually, a valid or reasonable way to estimate the\namount of fixture depreciation that would be offset by appraising land and fixtures\nas a single unit. We cannot discern any theory or facts that would tend to justify\n\n                                         33\n\fthis method of estimation, and even the Board‘s post hoc efforts to explain the\nestimate in its briefing and at oral argument offer none. Further, as WSPA points\nout, even if the Board‘s prediction of future land appreciation were correct, the\nBoard‘s calculation failed to consider prior land appreciation and the full tax\nimpact that would occur if land were valued at actual market value rather than\nadjusted base year value.\n       It is true, as the Board points out, that WSPA did not offer its own\nindependent economic assessment during the comment period. The record shows\nthat WSPA expressed its view that the cost impact of Rule 474 was ―greatly\nunderstated‖ and that the cost would be between $5 million and $10 million per\nyear — to which the Board responded that WSPA ―has not provided data or\nmethodology from which its cost impact estimates can be independently derived.‖\nThe Board contends that because its initial economic impact assessment is not ―in\nconflict with substantial evidence in the record‖ (Gov. Code, § 11350,\nsubd. (b)(2)), there is no basis for invalidating the regulation.\n       But WSPA‘s inactivity does not excuse the Board‘s failure to make a\nreasoned effort to initially assess the economic impact of Rule 474. Even if the\nBoard‘s initial determination is not ―in conflict with substantial evidence in the\nrecord‖ (Gov. Code, § 11350, subd. (b)(2)), the Board was independently\nobligated — regardless of what WSPA submitted during the comment period — to\n―provide in the record facts, evidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence\nupon which the agency relies to support its initial determination.‖ (Gov. Code,\n§ 11346.5, subd. (a)(8); see id., § 11346.2, subd. (b)(6)(A).) Although we do not\nunderstand this requirement to impose a heavy burden on the agency, we cannot\ndeem it satisfied by an opaque calculation unsupported by any facts or other\nevidence explaining its validity as a reasonable estimate. Were we to hold that an\nagency‘s initial determination of economic impact, though unintelligible, may be\n\n                                          34\n\fupheld so long as it does not ―conflict with substantial evidence in the record,‖ we\nwould effectively authorize agencies to merely assert the absence of significant\nadverse economic impact on businesses, without supporting evidence, unless an\naffected party provided evidence countering the agency‘s assertion. Although\naffected parties often may be well-positioned to elucidate the economic impact of\na proposed regulation, the APA does not shift the analytical task entirely onto\naffected parties. Instead, the statutes require the agency to meet an initial,\nnonconclusive, nonexhaustive evidentiary burden. (Id., §§ 11346.2,\nsubd. (b)(6)(A); 11346.5, subd. (a)(8).) Because we cannot read out of the APA\nthis modest requirement of rationality and transparency, we conclude that the\nBoard did not substantially comply with the APA in its initial determination that\nRule 474 would not have a significant adverse economic impact on businesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f                                   CONCLUSION\n       For the reasons above, we hold that Rule 474 is consistent with Proposition\n13, Proposition 8, and Revenue and Taxation Code section 51. At the same time,\nwe affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal invalidating Rule 474 because of\nthe Board‘s failure to make an adequate initial determination of the rule‘s\neconomic impact as required by the APA.\n                                                 LIU, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

In particular, I agree that\nalthough the rule at issue here (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 474; hereafter Rule 474),\nwhich was adopted by defendant Board of Equalization (Board), does not conflict\nwith any statute or with the state Constitution, it nevertheless is invalid because it\nwas not adopted in compliance with the California Administrative Procedure Act\n(Gov. Code, § 11340 et seq.; hereafter California APA). But if the Board\ncomplies with the California APA and concludes, after compliance, that the rule is\nwarranted, the Board may reissue the same rule.\n       In deciding that Rule 474 does not conflict with any statute or with the state\nConstitution, the majority characterizes the rule as a quasi-legislative regulation,\nsubject to the great judicial deference applicable to such regulations. (Maj. opn.,\nante, pp. 11-12.) I disagree. I would hold that the rule simply represents the\nBoard‘s interpretation of the Legislature‘s definition of ―real property‖ in Revenue\nand Taxation Code section 51, subdivision (d) (section 51(d)), and therefore the\nrule is an interpretive regulation subject to less judicial deference. Nevertheless,\nbecause Rule 474 correctly interprets the statute, I agree with the majority that it is\nsubstantively valid.\n                                           I\n       Plaintiff Western States Petroleum Association sued the Board, arguing, as\nrelevant here, that Rule 474 — which relates to the taxation of petroleum refinery\n\n\n                                           1\n\fproperties — conflicts with Revenue and Taxation Code section 51. That statute\ndescribes the method for calculating ―the taxable value of real property.‖ (Rev. &\nTax. Code, § 51, subd. (a).) ―[R]eal property‖ is ―that appraisal unit that persons\nin the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally valued\nseparately.‖ (§ 51(d).) Through Rule 474, the Board applies the statutory\ndefinition of ―real property‖ to petroleum refinery property, which is involved\nhere.\n        The Board issued Rule 474 under its express rulemaking authority over the\nassessment of property for purposes of taxation. (See Gov. Code, § 15606.) The\nrule reflects the Board‘s understanding of how section 51(d) should be applied, as\nwell as the Board‘s factual findings concerning the market for petroleum refinery\nproperty. Under that rule, the value of petroleum refineries, unlike most types of\nindustrial property, must generally be assessed as a single unit that includes both\nland and fixtures. Specifically, ―[t]he land, improvements, and fixtures and other\nmachinery and equipment classified as improvements for a petroleum refining\nproperty are rebuttably presumed to constitute a single appraisal unit . . . .‖ (Rule\n474.) The Board‘s rule is significant because of the limits the state Constitution\nplaces on the assessed value of land.\n        For tax purposes, the state Constitution values land at the ―base year value‖\n(generally, the market value when last sold), increased by an inflation factor that\nmay not exceed 2 percent per year. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 2.) Rule 474‘s\nbundling of land and fixtures affects property owners because land values tend to\nappreciate over time but fixture values tend to depreciate. For petroleum refinery\nproperty, fixtures represent a major portion of the property‘s overall value. If\nfixtures are taxed together with land as a single unit, then depreciation in the value\nof the fixtures is generally offset by appreciation in the value of the land, and thus\nfor tax purposes the overall value of the property remains unchanged. If, however,\n\n                                          2\n\ffixtures are taxed separately from land, then the owner will pay lower taxes on the\nfixtures as their values depreciate over time, and those lower fixture taxes will not\nbe offset by higher land taxes because of the just-described limits imposed by the\nstate Constitution.\n       Plaintiff challenges the Board‘s Rule 474 because assessment of a\npetroleum refinery‘s land and fixtures as a single unit increases the overall taxes\nfor the owners of such properties.\n       The majority concludes, as do I, that Rule 474 does not conflict with\nsection 51(d). But in reaching that conclusion, the majority states that Rule 474 is\na quasi-legislative regulation, and therefore entitled to great deference on judicial\nreview. (Maj. opn., ante, pp. 11-12.) By contrast, I construe the Board‘s rule as\nan interpretive regulation, subject to a lesser degree of judicial deference.\n                                           II\n       An administrative agency‘s regulations can be of two types: interpretive\nand quasi-legislative. As explained below, an interpretive regulation defines or\nclarifies an ambiguous term or phrase in a statute, whereas a quasi-legislative\nregulation is issued under a delegation of legislative power to fill a substantive gap\nleft open in a statute. The measure of whether a regulation is quasi-legislative is\nwhether it makes a new legal standard where none previously existed. The\nregulation is interpretive if applicable statutory law creates an enforceable\nstandard irrespective of the regulation.\n       The differences between the two types of regulations were described in\ndetail by this court 13 years ago: ―It is a ‗black letter‘ proposition that there are\ntwo categories of administrative rules and that the distinction between them\nderives from their different sources and ultimately from the constitutional doctrine\nof the separation of powers. One kind — quasi-legislative rules — represents an\nauthentic form of substantive lawmaking: Within its jurisdiction, the agency has\n\n                                           3\n\fbeen delegated the Legislature‘s lawmaking power. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . Unlike\nquasi-legislative rules, an agency‘s interpretation does not implicate the exercise\nof a delegated lawmaking power; instead, it represents the agency‘s view of the\nstatute‘s legal meaning and effect, questions lying within the constitutional\ndomain of the courts.‖ (Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization\n(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 (Yamaha), italics added; see also American Mining\nCongress v. Mine Safety & Health Administration (D.C. Cir. 1993) 995 F.2d 1106,\n1110 (American Mining) [―[T]he dividing line [between interpretive and quasi-\nlegislative regulations] is the necessity for agency legislative action . . . . [A] rule\nsupplying that action will be legislative . . . , and an interpretation that spells out\nthe scope of an agency‘s or regulated entity‘s pre-existing duty . . . will be\ninterpretive . . . .‖].)1\n        Yamaha also explained that quasi-legislative regulations are entitled to a\nhigh degree of deference, and that interpretive regulations are not. ―Because\nagencies granted . . . substantive rulemaking power are truly ‗making law,‘ their\nquasi-legislative rules have the dignity of statutes. When a court assesses the\nvalidity of such rules, the scope of its review is narrow. If satisfied that the rule in\nquestion lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the Legislature, and that\nit is reasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute, judicial review\nis at an end. [¶] . . . [¶] . . . Because an interpretation is an agency‘s legal\n\n1       Although American Mining, supra, 995 F.2d 1106, construes the federal\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.), not the California APA, its\ndiscussion of the distinction between interpretive and quasi-legislative regulations\nhas received wide recognition in the field of administrative law. (See, e.g., Breyer\net al., Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy (4th ed. 1999) pp. 622-623;\nDavis & Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise (Supp. 2000) pp. 189-190; Mashaw\net al., Administrative Law: The American Public Law System (5th ed. 2003)\npp. 587-592.)\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fopinion, . . . rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make law,\nit commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference. [Citation.]‖\n(Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at pp. 10-11, first and third set of italics added.)\n       Yamaha went on to say: ―[E]ven formal interpretive rules do not command\nthe same weight as quasi-legislative rules. Because ‗ ―the ultimate resolution\nof . . . legal questions rests with the courts‖ ‘ [citation], judges play a greater role\nwhen reviewing the persuasive value of interpretive rules than they do in\ndetermining the validity of quasi-legislative rules.‖ (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at\np. 13, italics added.)\n       This court later reiterated the same point in Sara M. v. Superior Court\n(2005) 36 Cal.4th 998: ―Quasi-legislative rules are those that the agency\npromulgates as part of the lawmaking power the Legislature has delegated to it.\nJudicial review of these rules is very limited. [Citation.] Rules that interpret a\nstatute receive less judicial deference.‖ (Id. at p. 1012, first and third set of italics\nadded.)\n       In summary, an agency‘s quasi-legislative regulations involve the\ndiscretionary creation of new law under a delegation of legislative power; court\nreview is therefore limited to ensuring that the regulation is within the scope of the\ndelegated power and not arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in a rational basis.\n(Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 11.) By contrast, interpretive regulations explain\nwhat existing law means, which is ultimately a task for the courts to perform.\nAlthough courts give ―great weight‖ to the administrative agency‘s view of the\nmatter, they do not otherwise defer to the agency. (Id. at p. 12.)\n                                           III\n       As noted (see pp. 1-2, ante), section 51(d), the statute involved here,\ndefines ―real property‖ for purposes of taxation as ―that appraisal unit that persons\nin the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally valued\n\n                                            5\n\fseparately.‖ The Board‘s Rule 474, adopted after the statute‘s enactment, states\nthat the value of petroleum refinery property must generally be assessed as a\nsingle unit that includes both land and fixtures. The majority here asserts that\nRule 474 is quasi-legislative because ―[t]he precise content of [the] regulation[] is\nneither mandated nor prohibited‖ by section 51(d). (Maj. opn., ante, p. 11.) I\ndisagree. In my view, Rule 474 interprets section 51(d), by applying it to a\nspecific type of property.\n       Here, it is section 51(d), not Rule 474, that provides the governing\nsubstantive standard. With or without Board rules elucidating the application of\nsection 51(d) to specific types of property, section 51(d) adequately defines ―real\nproperty‖ and can be applied to various types of real property, including petroleum\nrefinery properties, on a case-by-case basis. In other words, even without a rule\non point, the Legislature‘s statutory definition of ―real property‖ is, by itself, a\nfully enforceable legal standard.\n       This case is not one in which a statute identifies a complex problem (such\nas air pollution), sets forth a general goal (such as meeting state and federal air\nquality standards), and then broadly empowers an agency to study the problem and\nto adopt appropriate guidelines for specific industries that will achieve the\nLegislature‘s general goal. (See, e.g., Health & Saf. Code, § 40001, subd. (a); see\nalso American Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.\n(2012) 54 Cal.4th 446, 452-458.) In such a case, the statutory requirement is not\nself-executing, and the agency‘s regulation is necessary to establish which specific\nactions are prohibited and which are permitted. Not of that type, however, is\nsection 51(d)‘s definition of ―real property‖ for purposes of taxation. Section\n51(d) has no language through which the Legislature empowered the Board to\nmake new law defining real property. Rather, section 51(d)‘s definition of real\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fproperty is fully self-executing and enforceable irrespective of the Board‘s rules\ninterpreting how it should be applied in specific situations.\n       The majority bases its conclusion that Rule 474 is quasi-legislative on the\nexpress grant of rulemaking authority set forth in Government Code section\n15606. (Maj. opn., ante, pp. 10-11.) When the Legislature uses open-ended\nstatutory language and expressly delegates to an administrative agency the power\nto interpret key words in the statute at issue, the agency‘s interpretation of those\nwords is both quasi-legislative and interpretive. (Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co.\n(1999) 20 Cal.4th 785, 800 (Ramirez); see also Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at\npp. 17-18 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) It is quasi-legislative because the agency acts\nunder an express delegation of lawmaking power; it is interpretive because the\nagency is giving meaning to an open-ended term in the statute. (Ramirez, at\np. 800.) This court has not resolved what standard of review applies to such\nhybrid cases.\n       But for a regulation to be both quasi-legislative and interpretive, there must\nbe some clear indication that the Legislature actually intended and authorized the\nagency to exercise legislative power in interpreting statutory terms. (See Ramirez,\nsupra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 799-800.) A mere generic grant of rulemaking authority,\nwhich can be found for nearly every California agency (see, e.g., Ed. Code,\n§ 33031 [State Bd. of Education]; Pub. Resources Code, § 5003 [Dept. of Parks\nand Recreation]; Veh. Code, § 1651 [Dept. of Motor Vehicles]), is not enough to\nestablish that the agency acts legislatively whenever it issues an interpretive\nregulation. Otherwise, virtually every interpretive regulation would be quasi-\nlegislative, and the category of interpretive regulations would cease to have any\npractical meaning. That would be at odds with what this court said in Yamaha,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at pages 10-11, and because of the deference owed to quasi-\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\flegislative regulations, it would undermine the constitutional role of the courts in\ninterpreting statutory law.\n       Hence, in those cases where this court has concluded that the regulation in\nquestion has both quasi-legislative and interpretive characteristics, a clear\nindication existed that the Legislature intended the agency to exercise legislative\npower when interpreting the statute that the agency is charged with enforcing.\n(See Ramirez, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 799-800; Moore v. California State Bd. of\nAccountancy (1992) 2 Cal.4th 999, 1013-1014.) That clear indication is lacking\nhere. In such a situation, courts give the agency‘s interpretation of statutory\nlanguage ―great weight‖ but do not otherwise defer. (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th\nat p. 12.) Of course, to the extent an administrative regulation embodies findings\nof fact, courts must give such findings appropriate deference. (Ibid.; see Carmona\nv. Division of Industrial Safety (1975) 13 Cal.3d 303, 314 (Carmona).)\n       This case is similar to Carmona, supra, 13 Cal.3d 303, a decision of this\ncourt. Carmona involved a regulation issued by the California Division of\nIndustrial Welfare prohibiting the use of ―[u]nsafe hand tools.‖ (Id. at p. 307,\nitalics omitted.) A group of farmworkers asked the agency to issue what was in\neffect a supplemental rule declaring the ―short-handled hoe‖ to be an unsafe hand\ntool and banning its use throughout California. (Ibid.) Instead, the agency issued\na decision that the short-handled hoe was not an unsafe tool within the meaning of\nthe regulation at issue, reasoning that the short-handled hoe was not inherently\nunsafe. (Id. at p. 308.)\n       That Carmona involved the interpretation of a regulation, not a statute, is\nnot significant. ―The interpretation of a regulation, like the interpretation of a\nstatue, is, of course, a question of law [citations], and . . . the ultimate resolution of\nsuch legal questions rests with the courts.‖ (Carmona, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 310.)\nWhat is significant is that Carmona, like this case, involved the application of a\n\n                                            8\n\fbroad term (―unsafe hand tools‖) to a specific category (the ―short-handled hoe‖).\nCarmona concluded that the agency‘s decision (which permitted the statewide use\nof short-handled hoes and thus was, in effect, a regulation) was interpretive, not\nquasi-legislative. (Ibid.) As such, this court gave ―great weight‖ to the agency‘s\ninterpretation, but the court did not otherwise defer to the agency. (Ibid.) Instead,\nthe court concluded that the agency had misconstrued the unsafe-hand-tool\nregulation, and that the proper interpretation of that regulation should consider\nwhether a particular tool was unsafe as used, not merely whether it was inherently\nunsafe. (Id. at pp. 311-313.) Carmona remanded the matter to the agency for a\nnew factual determination based on a correct understanding of the law. (Id. at\np. 314.)\n       Like the Division of Industrial Welfare‘s application in Carmona of the\nunsafe-hand-tool regulation (Carmona, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 307) to a specific\ncategory of hand tool, the Board‘s application here of the statutory definition of\n―real property‖ (§ 51(d)) to a specific category of property is an interpretation of\nthe statute. As such, it is entitled to ―great weight,‖ but not to any greater judicial\ndeference. (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 12.)\n       The question remains whether the Board‘s construction of section 51(d) in\nRule 474 was correct. In my view it was. As noted, section 51(d) defines ―real\nproperty‖ as ―that appraisal unit that persons in the marketplace commonly buy\nand sell as a unit, or that is normally valued separately.‖ The Board took evidence\nand determined, as a factual matter, that the land and fixtures of petroleum\nrefinery property are virtually always bought and sold in California as a single\nunit. Giving ―great weight‖ (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 12) to the Board‘s\ninterpretation of section 51(d), I agree with the Board that the relevant\n―marketplace‖ for purposes of applying section 51(d) is the California\nmarketplace. In this context, the California marketplace makes the most sense, as\n\n                                           9\n\fsection 51(d) governs the taxation of California property. I also agree with the\nBoard that the word ―commonly‖ in section 51(d) does not require a high volume\nof sales, but rather an examination of which type of sale is most typical among the\nfew sales that occur.\n       From the Board‘s interpretations and factual findings, it follows that both\nthe land and fixtures of petroleum refinery property constitute ―real property‖\nunder section 51(d), and that is what the Board‘s Rule 474 says. The rule states\nthat ―[t]he land . . . and fixtures . . . for a petroleum refining property are\nrebuttably presumed to constitute a single appraisal unit‖ (and therefore ―real\nproperty‖ under section 51(d)). (Rule 474.) Because Rule 474 correctly interprets\nsection 51(d), it is substantively valid.\n       Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that because the Board did not\ncomply with the California APA in adopting Rule 474, the rule is procedurally\ninvalid, and therefore the Court of Appeal‘s judgment invalidating Rule 474 is\ncorrect.\n\n\n                                                    KENNARD, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion Western States Petroleum Association v.

Ct. No. BC403167\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        This case presents the issue of how petroleum refinery property should be\nvalued for purposes of taxation. In 1979, in response to the passage of Proposition\n13 and related constitutional and statutory enactments, the state Board of\nEqualization (Board) enacted a rule for assessing the value of most industrial\nproperty. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 461.) Under that rule, the value of\nfixtures, including machinery and equipment, was assessed separately from the\nvalue of land and improvements. Petroleum refinery property was assessed in this\nmanner. The separate valuation of fixtures was advantageous to industrial\nproperty owners because it allowed them to maximize the tax savings attributable\nto the depreciation of fixtures.\n        In 2007, the Board enacted rule 474 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 474;\nhereafter Rule 474) in light of evidence that petroleum refinery property — land,\nimprovements, and fixtures — was generally sold as a unit. Rule 474 provides\nthat the value of such property, unlike most industrial property, must be assessed\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fas a unit. The Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) sued to invalidate\nthe regulation. WSPA contends that Rule 474 is inconsistent with Proposition 13\nand related statutory enactments, and is therefore an unlawful exercise of the\nBoard‘s rulemaking authority. WSPA also contends that the rule is procedurally\ninvalid because the Board failed to assess the economic impact of the regulation as\nrequired by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) (Gov. Code, § 11346 et\nseq.).\n         The trial court and the Court of Appeal held Rule 474 invalid on both\ngrounds. We conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in finding Rule 474 to be\nsubstantively invalid. As explained below, Rule 474 is consistent with applicable\nconstitutional and statutory provisions, and it is also consistent with the long-\nstanding valuation principle that the proper appraisal unit is the collection of assets\nthat persons in the marketplace normally buy and sell as a single unit. Thus, the\nadoption of Rule 474 did not exceed the Board‘s rulemaking authority. At the\nsame time, however, we hold that the Board failed to provide an adequate\nassessment of the rule‘s economic impact as required by the APA. Under the\nAPA, the Board was required to make a reasoned estimate of all cost impacts of\nthe rule on affected parties. This the Board did not do. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeal on the ground that Rule 474 is procedurally\ndeficient under the APA.\n         We note that ―[o]rdinarily, when an appellate court concludes that\naffirmance of the judgment is proper on certain grounds it will rest its decision on\nthose grounds and not consider alternative grounds which may be available.\n[Citations.] [¶] However, appellate courts depart from this general rule in cases\nwhere the determination is of great importance to the parties and may serve to\navoid future litigation [citations], or where the issue presented is of continuing\npublic interest and is likely to recur.

Here, although the rule‘s\nprocedural deficiency is a sufficient basis for affirming the Court of Appeal‘s\njudgment, our consideration of the substantive ground for invalidating the rule is\nwarranted. The issue presents a question of law, it has been thoroughly briefed,\nand it is a matter of considerable importance to the parties and to the public.\n                                           I.\n       Article XIII, section 1 of the California Constitution declares that ―[a]ll\nproperty is taxable and shall be assessed at the same percentage of fair market\nvalue.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII, § 1, subd. (a).) Proposition 13, an initiative\nmeasure enacted in June 1978, added article XIII A to the California Constitution\nand changed the taxation of real property by replacing ―the fair market valuation\nstandard with that of acquisition value.‖ (Roy E. Hanson, Jr. Mfg. v. County of\nLos Angeles (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873.) Article XIII A, section 2 provides that\nall real property, except for property acquired prior to 1975, shall be assessed and\ntaxed at its value on the date of acquisition, subject to a 2 percent maximum\nannual inflationary increase. (Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. (1978)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1290435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1290435/amador-valley-jt-un-high-sch-v-state-bd-of-equal/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235.) This is sometimes referred to as the indexed or adjusted base\nyear value. (See Bd. of Equalization, Assessors‘ Handbook Section 501, Basic\nAppraisal (2002 rev.) appen. A, Assessment Pre- and Post-Proposition 13, p. 137.)\n       Proposition 13 did not address how real property should be assessed and\ntaxed when its market value declines instead of appreciates. To address this issue,\nCalifornia voters passed Proposition 8 in November 1978. Proposition 8 amended\narticle XIII A so that it now reads: ―The full cash value base may reflect from\nyear to year the inflationary rate not to exceed 2 percent for any given year or\nreduction as shown in the consumer price index or comparable data for the area\n\n                                           3\n\funder taxing jurisdiction, or may be reduced to reflect substantial damage,\ndestruction, or other factors causing a decline in value.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII A,\n§ 2, subd. (b).) In other words, when the value of real property declines to a level\nbelow its adjusted base year value under Proposition 13, the value of the property\nis determined according to its actual fair market value.\n       The Legislature formed a task force to study the implementation of the new\nreal property tax system mandated by Proposition 13 and Proposition 8. In\nJanuary 1979, the task force submitted a report and recommendations to the\nAssembly Committee on Revenue and Taxation, officially titled Report of the\nTask Force on Property Tax Administration (hereafter Task Force Report). (See\nPacific Southwest Realty Co. v. County of Los Angeles (1991) 1 Cal 4th 155, 161.)\nThe Task Force Report has been recognized as a statement of legislative intent for\npurposes of interpreting the statutes enacted to implement Proposition 13 and\nProposition 8. (See, e.g., Auerbach v. Assessment Appeals Bd.

Revenue and Taxation Code section 51 was subsequently\namended to incorporate the task force recommendations. (All further statutory\nreferences are to the Revenue and Taxation Code unless otherwise specified.)\nSection 51, subdivision (a) (hereafter section 51(a)) provides that ―the taxable\nvalue of real property shall . . . be the lesser of: [¶] (1) Its base year value,\ncompounded since the base year by an inflation factor‖ not to exceed 2 percent per\nyear, or ―(2) Its full cash value, as defined in Section 110, as of the lien date,\ntaking into account reductions in value due to damage, destruction, depreciation,\n\n                                            4\n\fobsolescence, removal of property, or other factors causing a decline in value.‖\nSection 110, subdivision (a) defines the term ―full cash value,‖ synonymously\nwith the term ―fair market value,‖ as ―the amount of cash or its equivalent that\nproperty would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in\nwhich neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other,\nand both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to\nwhich the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used, and of the\nenforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.‖\n       Most significantly for this case, the term ―real property‖ under section 51,\nsubdivision (d) (hereafter section 51(d)) is defined as ―that appraisal unit that\npersons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally\nvalued separately.‖ This definition echoes almost verbatim the definition\nrecommended by the Task Force Report. The statute does not further define\n―appraisal unit,‖ but the term is defined by regulation as ―a collection of assets that\nfunctions together, and that persons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as\na single unit or that is normally valued in the marketplace separately from other\nproperty . . . .‖ (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 324.)\n       In the wake of Proposition 13 and Proposition 8, and shortly before the\nenactment of section 51, the Board promulgated and then amended rule 461, a\nregulation applicable to most real property used for manufacturing. (Cal. Code\nRegs., tit. 18, § 461 (Rule 461).) Rule 461, subdivision (e) (hereafter Rule 461(e))\nprovides: ―Declines in value will be determined by comparing the current lien\ndate full value of the appraisal unit to the indexed base year full value of the same\nunit for the current lien date. Land and improvements constitute an appraisal unit\nexcept when measuring declines in value caused by disaster, in which case land\nshall constitute a separate unit. For purposes of this subdivision, fixtures and other\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fmachinery and equipment classified as improvements constitute a separate\nappraisal unit.‖\n       At the same time that it adopted Rule 461(e)‘s classification of fixtures as\n―a separate appraisal unit,‖ the Board adopted two exceptions to this rule for\ncertain types of industrial property where land and fixtures were valued as a single\nunit in the marketplace: Rule 468, which applies to oil and gas properties, and\nRule 469, which applies to mining properties. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18,\n§§ 468, subd. (c)(6) (Rule 468), 469, subd. (e)(2)(C) (Rule 469).) Rule 473,\nadopted in 1995, similarly treats land and fixtures on geothermal properties as a\nsingle appraisal unit. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, §473(e)(4)(C) (Rule 473).)\nPetroleum refinery property was covered by Rule 461(e) until the Board‘s\nadoption of Rule 474.\n       In September 2006, the Board voted three to two to adopt Rule 474 to\naddress ―the valuation of the real property, personal property, and fixtures used for\nthe refining of petroleum.‖ (Rule 474, subd. (a).) Subdivision (b)(1) of Rule 474\nstates that ―[t]he unique nature of property used for the refining of petroleum\nrequires the application of specialized appraisal techniques designed to satisfy the\nrequirements of article XIII, section 1, and article XIII A, section 2, of the\nCalifornia Constitution. To this end, petroleum refineries and other real and\npersonal property associated therewith shall be valued pursuant to the principles\nand procedures set forth in this section.‖ Rule 474, subdivision (c)(2) states that\n― ‗[a]ppraisal unit‘ consists of the real and personal property that persons in the\nmarketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit.‖ Most pertinent here, subdivision\n(d) states that ―[f]or the purposes of this section: [¶] (1) Declines in value of\npetroleum refining properties will be determined by comparing the current lien\ndate full value of the appraisal unit [i.e., its value in an open market transaction] to\nthe indexed base year full value of the same unit [i.e., its Proposition 13 value].\n\n                                           6\n\f[¶] (2) The land, improvements, and fixtures and other machinery and equipment\nclassified as improvements for a petroleum refining property are rebuttably\npresumed to constitute a single appraisal unit . . . . [¶] (3) In rebutting this\npresumption, the assessor may consider evidence that: [¶] (A) The land and\nimprovements including fixtures and other machinery and equipment classified as\nimprovements are not under common ownership or control and do not typically\ntransfer in the marketplace as one economic unit; or, [¶] (B) When the fixtures\nand other machinery and equipment classified as improvements are not\nfunctionally and physically integrated with the realty and do not operate together\nas one economic unit.‖ (Italics added.)\n       The difference between treating fixtures as a separate appraisal unit (Rule\n461(e)) and treating fixtures and land together as a single appraisal unit (Rule 474)\nmay be illustrated by a hypothetical drawn from a Board staff report. (For brevity,\nwe will use the term ―land‖ to refer to land and ―non-fixture‖ improvements\nconsidered together unless otherwise indicated.) Suppose that following the\npurchase of a petroleum refinery property, the assessed value in ―Year 1‖ of the\nland is $2 million and the assessed value of the fixtures is $1 million. Now\nsuppose the land appreciates at $100,000 per year while the fixtures, when\nappraised separately, depreciate at $100,000 per year. Under Rule 461(e), the\ntreatment of fixtures as a separate appraisal unit means that the assessed value of\nthe fixtures will decline by $100,000 each year, while the land, though\nappreciating at $100,000 per year, will yield an assessed value that increases by\nonly 2 percent each year, the maximum increase allowed by Proposition 13. The\nresults are shown in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f                                            Assessed value\n           Year              Land               Fixtures              Total\n             1           $2,000,000            $1,000,000          $3,000,000\n             2           $2,040,000            $900,000            $2,940,000\n             3           $2,080,800            $800,000            $2,880,800\n             4           $2,122,416            $700,000            $2,822,416\n             5           $2,164,864            $600,000            $2,764,864\n             6           $2,208,162            $500,000            $2,708,162\n\n\n       By contrast, if land and fixtures were treated as a single appraisal unit under\nRule 474, the total assessed value of petroleum refinery property beyond Year 1\nwould be greater than the values shown above. When such property is treated as a\nsingle unit, fixture depreciation ($100,000 per year) may be offset by the full\namount of land appreciation ($100,000 per year), resulting in a total assessed value\nof $3 million each year. The total assessed value may be even greater than $3\nmillion beyond Year 1 (though no greater than a 2 percent annual increase) to the\nextent that fixture values decline by less than $100,000 per year when petroleum\nrefinery fixtures are bought and sold in the open market as a single unit with the\nunderlying land. Thus, owners of petroleum refinery property pay higher property\ntaxes under Rule 474 than under Rule 461(e).\n       Before adopting Rule 474, the Board held a hearing at which several public\nofficials testified in favor of the rule. Typical was the testimony of Rick\nAuerbach, the Los Angeles County Assessor, who stated that in his experience\n―refineries in California . . . are bought and sold as a unit. . . . I am not aware of\none that has not been sold as a unit. If we have a case where there is the potential\nfor a refinery to be dismantled and sold — where the fixtures are sold separately,\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fthe proposed rule is a rebuttable presumption and we would take that into account.\nAnd we would value the fixtures separately.‖\n       The Board concluded in its final statement of reasons before adopting the\nrule that ―sufficient evidence in the rulemaking record exists to determine that\nproposed Rule 474 is necessary to obtain assessments more accurately reflecting\nhow petroleum refinery properties would actually trade in the marketplace. . . . At\nthe June 27, 2006 Property Tax Committee meeting, Thomas Parker, Deputy\nCounty Counsel, Sacramento County; Rick Auerbach, Los Angeles County\nAssessor and President of the California Assessor‘s Association; Lance Howser,\nChief Assessor, Solano County; and Robert Quon, Director of Major Appraisals\nfor the Los Angeles County Assessor‘s office, all testified that refineries are in fact\nbought, sold, and valued as a single unit. In the same meeting, Mr. Auerbach\ntestified that refineries are different from other heavily-fixtured manufacturing\nindustries such as breweries, canneries, and amusement parks and toy\nmanufacturing. Refineries are unique in that up to 80 percent of their values are\ncontained in the fixtures and because the land and fixtures are so integrated, it is\ndifficult to physically separate the fixtures from the land. Further, the land and\nfixtures are also so economically integrated that a buyer normally would not, in a\nfair market transaction, purchase the land separately from the fixtures or the\nfixtures separately from the land. [¶] Since petroleum refineries are bought and\nsold as a unit consisting of land and fixtures, to value the fixtures separate and\napart from the land may result in assessed values either below or above fair market\nvalue in violation of Propositions 8 and 13.‖\n       Petroleum industry counsel submitted evidence to the Board, mostly in the\nform of for-sale advertisements and newspaper articles, showing that refinery\nfixtures are sometimes dismantled and sold separately.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f       In November 2007, the Office of Administrative Law approved the\nregulation, and it became effective in December 2007. In December 2008, WSPA\nfiled a complaint challenging Rule 474‘s validity, alleging four causes of action\nand seeking a declaration that (1) the Board violated the APA because Rule 474 is\ninconsistent with California Constitution article XIII A and section 51(d), and not\nnecessary to implement such law; (2) Rule 474 violates article XIII A‘s cap on\nyear-to-year increases in assessed value of real property; (3) Rule 474 violates\narticle XIII A‘s requirement of a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for raising real\nproperty taxes; and (4) Rule 474 violates petroleum refiners‘ constitutional right to\nequal protection and uniformity of laws.\n       In October 2009, the Board and WSPA filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. WSPA argued that Rule 474 violates section 51(d) and California\nConstitution article XIII A, and that the Board failed to provide an adequate\nstatement of economic impact as required by the APA. The trial court granted\nWSPA‘s summary judgment motion on both grounds, and the Court of Appeal\naffirmed on both grounds. We granted review.\n                                           II.\n       We first address the standard of review. Government Code section 15606,\nsubdivision (c) authorizes the Board to ―[p]rescribe rules and regulations to govern\nlocal boards of equalization when equalizing, and assessors when assessing . . . .‖\nFurther, the Board is empowered to ―[p]repare and issue instructions to assessors\ndesigned to promote uniformity throughout the state and its local taxing\njurisdictions in the assessment of property for the purposes of taxation.‖ (Id.,\nsubd. (e).) Such rules ―shall include, but are not limited to, rules, regulations,\ninstructions, and forms relating to classifications of kinds of property and\nevaluation procedures.‖ (Id., subd. (f).) As these provisions indicate, the orderly\nfunctioning of our property tax system depends on administrative regulations to\n\n                                           10\n\fimplement general statutory directives. The precise content of such regulations is\nneither mandated nor prohibited by statute and may depend on the application of\nstatutory principles to particular factual situations. Rule 474 is one such\nregulation arising from the Board‘s exercise of its quasi-legislative power to issue\ngenerally applicable and legally enforceable regulations pursuant to statutory\nauthorization. (See American Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality\nManagement Dist. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (American Coatings).)\n       As discussed below, the Board in promulgating Rule 474 was required not\nonly to interpret the relevant statute but also to evaluate whether the evidence\npresented to it was sufficient to warrant a special rule governing petroleum\nrefinery property. The latter task involves the exercise of the Board‘s discretion.\nJustice Kennard contends that Rule 474 was an interpretive and not a quasi-\nlegislative regulation, citing Carmona v. Division of Industrial Safety (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608971\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608971/carmona-v-division-of-industrial-safety/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309–310 (Carmona). (See conc. and dis. opn. by Kennard, J, post, at\npp. 8–9.) But Carmona is distinguishable because the agency there ―viewed the\nquestion before it as a matter involving the interpretation and application of an\nexisting regulation‖ and therefore was not making ―a quasi-legislative judgment\ndeclining to promulgate a new regulation.‖ (Carmona, at p. 310.) In issuing Rule\n474, the Board has clearly promulgated a new regulation applying to a specific\nclass of property and, in so doing, has made a quasi-legislative judgment based on\nits evaluation of the evidence as well as its understanding of the statute.\n       As our precedent has stated, ―quasi-legislative rules . . . represent[] an\nauthentic form of substantive lawmaking: Within its jurisdiction, the agency has\nbeen delegated the Legislature‘s lawmaking power. [Citations.] Because agencies\ngranted such substantive rulemaking power are truly ‗making law,‘ their quasi-\nlegislative rules have the dignity of statutes. When a court assesses the validity of\nsuch rules, the scope of its review is narrow. If satisfied that the rule in question\n\n                                          11\n\flay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the Legislature, and that it is\nreasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute, judicial review is at\nan end.‖ (Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198892\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198892/yamaha-corp-v-state-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10–11 (Yamaha); see Gov. Code, § 11342.2 [implementing regulations adopted\npursuant to statutory authorization must be ―consistent and not in conflict with the\nstatute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.‖].) When\na regulation is challenged on the ground that it is not ―reasonably necessary to\neffectuate the purpose of the statute,‖ our inquiry is confined to whether the rule is\narbitrary, capricious, or without rational basis (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 11\n& fn. 4) and whether substantial evidence supports the agency‘s determination that\nthe rule is reasonably necessary (Gov. Code, § 11350, subd. (b)(1)).\n       At the same time, when an implementing regulation is challenged on the\nground that it is ―in conflict with the statute‖ (Gov. Code, § 11342.2) or does not\n―lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the Legislature‖ (Yamaha,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 10), the issue of statutory construction is a question of law\non which a court exercises independent judgment. (See American Coatings,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 460.) In determining whether an agency has incorrectly\ninterpreted the statute it purports to implement, a court gives weight to the\nagency‘s construction. (See id. at p. 461 [―How much weight . . . is\n‗situational,‘ and greater weight may be appropriate when an agency has\na ‗ ―comparative interpretive advantage over the courts,‖ ‘ as when ‗ ―the legal\ntext to be interpreted is technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or entwined with\nissues of fact, policy, and discretion.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖].) ―Nevertheless, the proper\ninterpretation of a statute is ultimately the court‘s responsibility.‖ (Id. at p. 462.)\n                                          III.\n       Although WSPA contends that Rule 474 is arbitrary and unsupported by\nsubstantial evidence, its principal argument is that Rule 474 violates various\n\n                                           12\n\fstatutory and constitutional provisions. Notably, WSPA does not challenge Rule\n474 on the ground that its factual premise — that petroleum refinery land and\nfixtures are usually sold together — is somehow infirm. During the public\ncomment process, petroleum industry representatives submitted materials showing\nthat refinery fixtures are, on occasion, sold separately from the land. Consistent\nwith these materials, Rule 474 expressly acknowledges the possibility that refinery\nland and fixtures are not invariably sold as a unit: subdivision (d)(2) establishes a\nrebuttable presumption that refinery land and fixtures constitute a single appraisal\nunit, and subdivision (d)(3) describes the types of evidence that may rebut the\npresumption. Moreover, WSPA does not contend that it is burdensome to rebut\nthe presumption in situations where refinery land and fixtures are not sold,\ncontrolled, or operated as a single unit. WSPA‘s position is that even if refinery\nland and fixtures are generally sold as a single unit, the Board is statutorily and\nconstitutionally prohibited from appraising such land and fixtures as a single unit.\nWe apply independent judgment in resolving the issues of statutory and\nconstitutional interpretation before us.\n                                           A.\n       As noted, the constitutional mandate governing our real property tax system\nbefore Proposition 13 was that such property ―shall be assessed at the same\npercentage of fair market value.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII, § 1.) After the passage of\nProposition 13 and Proposition 8, the California Constitution now provides: ―The\nfull cash value base may reflect from year to year the inflationary rate not to\nexceed 2 percent for any given year or reduction as shown in the consumer price\nindex or comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction, or may be reduced\nto reflect substantial damage, destruction, or other factors causing a decline in\nvalue.‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 2, subd. (b).) So, while there is a cap on the\nassessed value of property when its fair market value has appreciated, the assessed\n\n                                           13\n\fvalue of property remains its fair market value when that value has fallen. (See\nState Bd. of Equalization v. Board of Supervisors (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n822–823 [Board rule enacted after Proposition 13 but before Proposition 8\ndisallowing ―actual market value depreciation‖ is inconsistent with article XIII,\nsection 1].) Rule 474‘s market-based approach to determining the proper appraisal\nunit for petroleum refinery property ensures that reductions in property values are\nmeasured according to fair market value. Thus, Rule 474 appears consistent with\narticles XIII and XIII A.\n       Rule 474 is also consistent with section 51(d). As noted, section 51(d)\nstates: ―For purposes of this section, ‗real property‘ means that appraisal unit that\npersons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally\nvalued separately.‖ By its terms, the statute provides two alternative methods of\ndetermining the appraisal unit that constitutes taxable real property: it is either\n(1) a unit ―that persons in the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit‖ or\n(2) a unit ―that is normally valued separately.‖ Rule 474 applies the first method\nto petroleum refinery property.\n       The Court of Appeal rejected this straightforward reading of section 51(d).\nRelying on legislative history, it opined that ―the Legislature, in enacting the\nsection, did not intend to approve the use of two, alternative and disjunctive\ndefinitions of appraisal units of real property at the sole discretion of [the Board].\nInstead, the Legislature was acknowledging that the then-existing valuation\nformulas contemplated valuing land and improvements as an appraisal unit, and\nvaluing fixtures as a separate appraisal unit to allow for depreciation, and it\nintended that these valuation formulas would carry forward under Prop. 13 and\nProp. 8, particularly in the absence of evidence of any change in circumstances\njustifying a change in valuation formulas. Giving such a meaning to section 51(d)\nmakes sense when its historical context is remembered. In its effort to implement\n\n                                          14\n\fProp. 13 and Prop. 8 in accord with the voters‘ intent, the Legislature reasonably\nconcluded that it was important that the valuation formulas existing before the\nvoters spoke would remain the same under the new tax system established by the\nvoters. In short, the voters‘ conception of ‗real property‘ as it was defined and\nvalued would remain the same under the new real property tax system as it was\nunder the prior real property tax system in order to assure that the restrictions\nimposed on real property taxes would actually result in realized restrictions on real\nproperty taxes. The Legislature well reasoned that, if the manner in which real\nproperty was understood and valued did not remain constant in the transition from\nthe prior real property tax system to the new real property tax system, then the\nvoters‘ intended goal of restricting real property taxes might prove elusive. [The\nBoard‘s] interpretation of section 51(d) essentially discards the statute‘s intent to\nfix in place the pre-Prop. 13 and Prop. 8 valuation formulas for real property.\nInstead, [the Board] would interpret section 51(d) to allow for the adoption of new\nvaluation formulas by which the framework governing real property could be\nmanipulated to avoid the restrictions on real property taxes imposed by the voters\nwhen they approved Prop. 13 and Prop. 8.‖\n       There is no dispute that section 51(d)‘s definition of a taxable ―appraisal\nunit‖ was intended to promote continuity in valuation practices before and after\nthe passage of Proposition 13 and Proposition 8. The Task Force Report, which\nrecommended the two alternative concepts of an appraisal unit codified in section\n51(d), explained that ―the purpose of Prop. 13 was to place a cap on the value of\nproperty in any one year, while Prop. 8 sought to allow values to rise and fall to\nany point below this cap, should actual market values so dictate. [¶] The purpose\nof the ‗appraisal unit‘ concept is to ensure that these increases or declines in value\nbe measured in the same manner as such property was appraised prior to Prop.\n13.‖ (Task Force Rep., supra, at p. 31, italics added.)\n\n                                          15\n\f       What is disputed is how real property was appraised prior to Proposition\n13. WSPA and the Court of Appeal contend that in the case of industrial property,\nland and fixtures have historically been appraised separately and that section\n51(d)‘s ―normally valued separately‖ language was intended to codify this\npractice. According to the Court of Appeal, ―assessors for many years leading up\nto the late 1970‘s assessed the value of land and improvements as one appraisal\nunit, and assessed the value of fixtures as a separate appraisal unit in order to\naccount for depreciation. And, it appears from the appellate record that while the\nowner of a manufacturing or industrial property may have received a single real\nproperty tax bill each year, the bill would have been the reflection of an assessed\nvalue for land and improvements, and an assessed value for fixtures. The total\nassessed value of the real property would then be computed by adding the two\ndistinct appraisal units, with the ad valorem real property tax then imposed on the\ntotal assessed value. As a result of the practice of applying these separate\nappraisal units valuation formulas, the value of the fixture-related appraisal unit of\nan industrial or manufacturing property would, in the absence of the addition of\nnew fixtures, decline each year to reflect depreciation. This means that the\namount of real property taxes attributable to fixtures would also decline.‖\n       The Court of Appeal, however, appears to have confused assessment with\nvaluation. Constitutional and statutory provisions have long required land and\nimprovements to be assessed separately, with improvements in this context\nincluding fixtures. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, § 13; §§ 105, 602, 607.) This principle\nwas explained in Mahoney v. City of San Diego (1926) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3309042\"><a href=\"/opinion/3308989/mahoney-v-city-of-san-diego/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where an\nassessor arbitrarily valued improvements separately from land and thereby\nsystematically undervalued the improvements, apparently to encourage\ndevelopment. This court recognized that in order to comply with constitutional\nand statutory requirements that ―improved and unimproved real estate shall have a\n\n                                          16\n\funiform basis of valuation, it was essential that the valuations to be placed upon\nland and upon the improvements thereon, whether in the form of buildings or\ncrops or trees, should be separately set forth in the making of assessments\nthereon.‖ (Id. at p. 399.) But we made clear that the constitutional and statutory\nprovisions requiring separate assessments ―do not refer to the valuations to be\nplaced upon these two classes of taxable property, but merely to the fact that the\nvaluations thereof fixed by the assessor in conformity with the other provisions of\nthe constitution and statutes relating to the basis of the assessment of property\nvalues shall be separately stated by him in his assessment-books.‖ (Ibid., italics\nadded.) We thus rejected the assessor‘s interpretation of the relevant\nconstitutional and statutory provisions to mean that he was required to appraise\nimprovements as if they were ―physical[ly] separat[ed] from the real estate upon\nwhich [they] stood.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Thus, the fact that separate assessments for land and fixtures appear on a\nproperty tax bill is not evidence of separate appraisal of those components of real\nproperty. The requirement of separate assessments was never intended to supplant\nthe market-based approach to determining the proper appraisal unit, and this\ndistinction has long been recognized in practice. (See Bd. of Equalization,\nAssessors Handbook, Appraisal of Urban Real Estate (2d ed. 1958) Appraisal\nProcess, p. 5 (1958 Assessors Handbook) [―Valuation of improved property as a\nunit does not conflict with provisions of State law requiring values of land and\nimprovements to be separately entered on the assessment roll. The legal\nprovisions do not require the separate appraisal of land and improvements but\nmerely that the valuations of each shall be separately stated on the assessment\nroll.‖]; Bd. of Equalization, Assessors‘ Handbook, General Appraisal Manual\n(1966) Economics of Value, p. 16 (1966 Assessors‘ Handbook) [―For purposes of\nassessment, the law requires a separate assessment of land, improvements, and\n\n                                         17\n\fpersonal property. But statutes do not require separate appraisals of these different\nclasses of property.‖]; Bd. of Equalization, Assessors‘ Handbook, General\nAppraisal Manual (1975) Market Value Concept, p. 13 (1975 Assessors‘\nHandbook) [same].)\n       As the Task Force Report indicates, the Legislature enacted section 51(d)\non the understanding that real property values may ―rise and fall . . . [to] any point\nbelow [the Proposition 13] cap, should actual market values so dictate.‖ (Task\nForce Rep., supra, at p. 31.) Rule 474 furthers the long-standing mandate to\nappraise real property according to ―actual market values,‖ and the evidence in the\nrecord shows that Rule 474‘s market-based approach to determining the proper\nappraisal unit was in fact the traditional method for making such determinations\nbefore Proposition 13. The 1966 Assessors‘ Handbook makes this clear: ―It is\nobvious that market value necessarily involves a unit as well as a price.\nConsequently, no discussion of market value is complete unless there is some\nanalysis of the unit to be valued. It seems to be clear that, since the objective is\nmarket value, the proper unit to be valued is a unit that is dealt in by the market,\ni.e., one that people buy and sell. Any fraction of this unit involves artificiality.‖\n(1966 Assessors‘ Handbook, supra, at pp. 15–16.) The 1975 Assessors Handbook\nsimilarly states: ―Since the appraisal objective is to estimate market value, the\nproper unit to be valued is the unit that people in the market buy and sell.‖ (1975\nAssessors‘ Handbook, supra, at p. 12.) If ―[t]he unit typically dealt in by the\nmarket is the combination of land and building,‖ then ―the combination is the\nlogical appraisal unit from an economic point of view.‖ (Ibid.; see also 1958\nAssessors Handbook, supra, at p. 5 [―It is well recognized that the sum of the\nvalue estimates of fractional parts of a property is not necessarily equal to the\nvalue of the whole, and that values of land and improvements are not independent\nof each other. It follows, therefore, that improved realty must be valued as a\n\n                                          18\n\funit.‖].) Thus, Rule 474 is fully consistent with the Legislature‘s objective ―to\nensure that . . . declines in value [are] measured in the same manner as such\nproperty was appraised prior to Prop. 13.‖ (Task Force Rep., supra, at p. 31.)\nBefore and after Proposition 13, actual market value has guided the appraisal of\nreal property in the declining value context.\n       WSPA notes that Rule 461(e), promulgated just before the enactment of\nsection 51(d), ―has expressly segregated land and fixtures for decline-in-value\npurposes since 1979‖ and contends that ―the Board has historically interpreted\n[section 51(d)‘s] ‗normally valued separately‘ language as codifying Rule 461(e).‖\nBut contemporaneous with its adoption of Rule 461(e), the Board also adopted\nRule 468 (oil and gas properties) and Rule 469 (mining properties), which treat\nland and fixtures as a single appraisal unit based on marketplace realities. Further,\nin 1995, the Board adopted Rule 473, which similarly treats land and fixtures on\ngeothermal properties as a single appraisal unit. Thus, the Board has not\ninterpreted section 51(d) to codify a rule that fixtures must always be treated as a\nseparate appraisal unit in the declining value context or that the treatment of land\nand fixtures as a single unit is limited only to the exceptions that existed when\nsection 51(d) was enacted.\n       WSPA cites no other evidence that section 51(d) was intended to codify\nRule 461(e), and we are aware of none. It is true that section 51(d)‘s alternative\nconceptions of ―appraisal unit‖ — what ―persons in the marketplace commonly\nbuy and sell as a unit‖ and what ―is normally valued separately‖ — indicate that\nthe Board has leeway to define an appraisal unit by reference to customary\nappraisal practices when, for example, there is little market information about how\na particular type of property is bought or sold. But there is no indication that the\nLegislature intended the Board to be forever bound by the conception of ―appraisal\nunit‖ it formulated in 1979, even when the Board later has substantial evidence\n\n                                          19\n\fthat separate appraisal of land and fixtures does not reflect how a particular type of\nproperty is traded in the marketplace. To the extent that Rule 461(e) informs the\nmeaning of section 51(d), it was undisputed during this rulemaking that Rule\n461(e) itself, consistent with historic appraisal practices, reflected a marketplace\njudgment that land and fixtures for industrial property are typically bought and\nsold separately, and therefore should be appraised separately. In adopting a\ndifferent method for appraising petroleum refinery property on the ground that\nsuch property is typically bought and sold as a single unit, the Board followed,\nrather than departed from, the marketplace approach underlying Rule 461(e) as\nwell as Rules 468, 469, and 473. Although WSPA contends that petroleum\nrefinery property more closely resembles properties covered by Rule 461(e) than\nproperties covered by Rules 468, 469, or 473, there is substantial evidence in the\nrecord that land and fixtures on petroleum refinery property are uniquely\nintegrated, that fixtures represent an unusually high proportion of the value of such\nproperty, and that petroleum refinery land and fixtures are usually sold as a single\nunit. (See ante, at pp. 8–9.)\n       Rule 474 thus represents no change in the method of determining the\nappropriate appraisal unit. In adopting this exception to Rule 461(e) for petroleum\nrefinery property, the Board sought to align the concept of ―appraisal unit‖ with\nthe settled rule that when real property declines in value, it should be appraised\naccording to its actual market value. There is no evidence that section 51(d) was\nintended to freeze or codify the treatment of industrial fixtures as a separate\nappraisal unit. Rule 474 comports with section 51(d), which defines taxable ―real\nproperty‖ in one of its formulations as ―that appraisal unit that persons in the\nmarketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit.‖\n       Finally, WSPA contends there are other types of industrial property that are\nsimilarly integrated with the land and have a comparably high proportion of\n\n                                          20\n\fproperty value derived from fixtures. To prevail against this argument, the Board\nneed only establish that Rule 474 is not arbitrary, capricious, or without a rational\nbasis. (See Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at pp. 10–11.) Under this standard, the\nBoard need not extend the rule to all other comparable types of industrial property\nor show that petroleum refinery property is entirely unique. (See U.S. Cellular\nCorp. v. F.C.C. (D.C. Cir. 2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185411\"><a href=\"/opinion/185411/us-cell-corp-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 [Regulatory ―agencies need not\naddress all problems ‗in one fell swoop,‘ [citations][.] ‗Reform may take place\none step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most\nacute to the [regulatory] mind.[]‘ ‖].) It is enough that the Board has reached a\nrational conclusion, based on substantial evidence, that petroleum refinery\nproperty is sufficiently different from most industrial property to warrant appraisal\nof land and fixtures as a single unit. (See ante, at pp. 8–9.)\n                                          B.\n       Apart from its contention that Rule 474 is inconsistent with section 51(d),\nWSPA argues that Rule 474 has the effect of taxing unrealized increases in land\nvalue in violation of Proposition 13: ―Proposition 13 allows the reassessment of\nland, in whole or in part, under only three circumstances: a change in ownership,\nnew construction, and a capped inflation adjustment. Rule 474, however, allows\nunrealized increases in land and improvements value, not assessable under\nProp. 13, to offset actual declines in fixture value resulting from depreciation even\nif none of the three exceptions occur. In so doing, Rule 474 violates a central tenet\nof Prop. 13 . . . by allowing land value in excess of the base-year value cap on land\nto be assessed.‖\n       This argument fails, however, because Proposition 13 does not specifically\ncap the taxable value of land or improvements per se. Instead, Proposition 13 caps\ngrowth in ―the appraised value of real property‖ (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 2,\nsubd. (a), italics added), which in this context encompasses land, improvements,\n\n                                          21\n\fand fixtures (§§ 104, 105). To say that Rule 474 violates Proposition 13 by\nallowing taxation of unrealized land value above the Proposition 13 cap is to\nassume that land, by itself, must be treated as a separate appraisal unit for purposes\nof real property taxation. But, as explained above, no constitutional or statutory\nprovision precludes the Board from treating land and fixtures as a single appraisal\nunit when substantial evidence indicates that a particular type of property is\nbought and sold as a single unit in the marketplace.\n       Further, WSPA contends that Rule 474 violates the Legislature‘s mandate,\nenacted pursuant to Proposition 13, that the ―full cash value‖ of real property\n―tak[e] into account reductions in value due to . . . depreciation . . . .‖ (§ 51(a)(2).)\nAccording to WSPA, because the fair market value of petroleum refinery property\nconsidered as a single unit masks the value of fixture depreciation considered by\nitself, Rule 474‘s treatment of land and fixtures as a single appraisal unit violates\nthe requirement to account for depreciation in determining full cash value.\n       However, Rule 474 does ―tak[e] into account reductions in value due to . . .\ndepreciation‖ in determining the ―full cash value‖ of petroleum refinery property.\n(§ 51(a)(2).) Section 51(a)(2) refers to ―full cash value, as defined in Section\n110,‖ and section 110 defines ―full cash value‖ (and, synonymously, ―full market\nvalue‖) to mean, with exceptions not relevant here, ―the amount of cash or its\nequivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under\nconditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies\nof the other, and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses\nand purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being\nused, and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes.‖ By\nfocusing on the value of property ―if exposed for sale in the open market‖ in a fair\nand transparent transaction, the definition of ―full cash value‖ contemplates that\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\fappraisal of real property will reflect the economic reality of how a particular type\nof property is actually bought and sold.\n       For property whose fixtures are typically sold separately in the open\nmarket, fixtures are properly treated as a separate appraisal unit, and fixture\ndepreciation may be independently recognized. But when land and fixtures are\ntypically sold as a single unit, they are properly treated as a single appraisal unit,\neven if fixture depreciation is offset by land appreciation or otherwise reduced by\nvaluing land and fixtures together. Indeed, consistent with the emphasis on\nmarketplace realities in the Assessors‘ Handbooks cited earlier (see ante, at\npp. 17–18), we recognized in Mahoney that ―in common knowledge and\nexperience,‖ the actual market value of improvements is often ―dependent upon\nthe location‖ and cannot accurately be determined by separating improvements\nfrom the underlying land. (Mahoney, supra, 198 Cal. at pp. 401–402.) To account\nfor fixture depreciation separately when land and fixtures are actually bought and\nsold as a single unit would allow the owner to claim a reduction in real property\nvalue that is economically fictitious, resulting in a tax windfall. Neither California\nConstitution article XIII A nor section 51 nor traditional appraisal practices\nrequire the unit of appraisal to be defined in a manner that maximizes the\ndepreciation of fixtures in contravention of economic reality. To the contrary, the\nlaw and consistent practice have long required appraisal of real property in the\ndeclining value context to reflect its ―full cash value‖ — that is, the value\n―property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market.‖ (§§ 51(a)(2), 110.)\nRule 474 is consistent with this principle.\n                                           C.\n       WSPA also contends that Rule 474 violates the constitutional prohibition\non tax increases without a two-thirds vote of the each house of the Legislature.\nCalifornia Constitution article XIII A, section 3, subdivision (a) (hereafter article\n\n                                           23\n\fXIII A section 3(a)) provides: ―Any change in state statute which results in any\ntaxpayer paying a higher tax must be imposed by an act passed by not less than\ntwo-thirds of all members elected to each of the two houses of the Legislature,\nexcept that no new ad valorem taxes on real property, or sales or transaction taxes\non the sales of real property may be imposed.‖ WSPA argues that because the\nadoption of Rule 474 results in a higher tax bill for at least some petroleum\nrefinery owners, it violates the two-thirds voting requirement.\n       By its terms, article XIII A section 3(a) applies only to a ―change in state\nstatute which results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax.‖ (Italics added.) It does\nnot apply to an agency‘s decision to modify an administrative rule in response to\nsubstantial evidence that such modification is reasonably necessary to faithfully\nimplement an existing statute. The Court of Appeal‘s decision in River Garden\nRetirement Home v. Franchise Tax Bd. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is instructive.\nThere, the taxpayer argued that the Franchise Tax Board enacted a tax increase\nwithin the meaning of article XIII A, section 3(a) when it adopted a policy of\ndisallowing certain dividend deductions so as to conform to statutory and case\nlaw. Rejecting this argument, the court said: ―Section 3 . . . by its terms and\naccording to the overall aim of the initiative applies only to revenue increasing\nenactments. The FTB is charged with administering and enforcing our franchise\nand income tax laws. It does not have taxing powers. . . . . It did not ‗enact‘\nanything within the meaning of article XIII A, section 3.‖ (Id. at pp. 949–950.)\n       The Board here is similarly charged with administering and enforcing the\nstate‘s property tax laws and has no taxing power. Article XIII A, section 3(a)\ndoes not prevent the Board from exercising its statutorily delegated authority to\npromote uniform assessment practices by revising its own rules regarding\nappraisal units to more closely reflect the actual market value of real property.\nThe Board has no power to determine tax rates or to extend the scope of a tax to\n\n                                         24\n\fitems previously untaxed.

In sum, the Board‘s modification of its own\npost-Proposition 13 rules to more accurately appraise a class of property is not a\ntax increase resulting from a ―change in state statute‖ under article XIII A, section\n3(a).\n                                         III.\n        In addition to challenging Rule 474‘s substantive validity, WSPA contends\nthat the adoption of the rule was procedurally deficient because the Board failed to\nadequately assess the economic impact of the regulation as required by the APA.\nIn addressing this issue, we begin with a brief review of the APA.\n                                          A.\n        ―The APA is intended to advance ‗meaningful public participation in the\nadoption of administrative regulations by state agencies‘ and create ‗an\nadministrative record assuring effective judicial review.‘ [Citation.] In order to\ncarry out these dual objectives, the APA (1) establishes ‗basic minimum\nprocedural requirements for the adoption, amendment or repeal of administrative\nregulations‘ (Gov.

(Gov. Code, §§\n11346.2, 11346.5, subd. (a).) The notice must contain ―a copy of the express\nterms of the proposed regulation‖ as well as ―an initial statement of reasons for\nproposing the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation.‖ (Id., § 11346.2,\nsubds. (a), (b).) This initial statement of reasons must include ―[a] statement of\nthe specific purpose of each adoption, amendment, or repeal‖ and ―[a] description\nof reasonable alternatives to the regulation and the agency‘s reasons for rejecting\nthose alternatives.‖ (Id., § 11346.2, subd. (b)(1), (5)(A).) The initial statement of\nreasons also must include ―[f]acts, evidence, documents, testimony, or other\nevidence on which the agency relies to support an initial determination that the\naction will not have a significant adverse economic impact on businesses.‖ (Id.,\n§ 11346.2, subd. (b)(6)(A).) We examine the economic impact assessment\nrequirement in detail below.\n       The notice of proposed action is followed by a public comment period.\nUnder Government Code section 11346.8, the agency may hold a public hearing at\nwhich ―both oral and written statements, arguments, or contentions, shall be\npermitted. . . . If a public hearing is not scheduled, the state agency shall . . .\nafford any interested person or his or her duly authorized representative, the\nopportunity to present statements, arguments or contentions in writing.‖\nGovernment Code section 11346.5, subdivision (a)(15) provides that the notice of\nproposed action must specify ―[t]he date by which comments submitted in writing\n\n                                           26\n\fmust be received to present statements, arguments, or contentions in writing\nrelating to the proposed action in order for them to be considered by the state\nagency before it adopts, amends, or repeals a regulation.‖ ―In addition, a public\nhearing shall be held if, no later than 15 days prior to the close of the written\ncomment period, an interested person or his or her duly authorized representative\nsubmits in writing to the state agency, a request to hold a public hearing.‖ (Gov.\nCode, § 11346.8, subd. (a).)\n       After the public comment period, if the agency decides to enact the\nregulation, it must prepare a ―final statement of reasons‖ for adopting the proposed\nrule, which must include ―[a]n update of the information contained in the initial\nstatement of reasons.‖ (Gov. Code, § 11346.9, subd. (a)(1).) ―If the update\nidentifies any data or any technical, theoretical or empirical study, report, or\nsimilar document on which the agency is relying in proposing the adoption,\namendment, or repeal of a regulation that was not identified in the initial statement\nof reasons, or which was otherwise not identified or made available for public\nreview prior to the close of the public comment period,‖ then the agency must\nmake such document available to those participating in the public comment period\nat least 15 days before adoption of the proposed rule, and the agency must permit\nand respond to comments regarding that document, pursuant to Government Code\nsection 11347.1. (Gov. Code, § 11346.9, subd. (a)(1).) The final statement of\nreasons must also include ―[a] summary of each objection or recommendation\nmade regarding the specific adoption, amendment, or repeal proposed, together\nwith an explanation of how the proposed action has been changed to accommodate\neach objection or recommendation, or the reasons for making no change.‖ (Gov.\nCode, § 11346.9, subd.

Several statutory provisions\naddress an agency‘s obligation to assess the economic impact of a new regulation.\nAs noted, an agency‘s initial statement of reasons for proposing a regulation must\ninclude ―[f]acts, evidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence on which the\nagency relies to support an initial determination that the action will not have a\nsignificant adverse economic impact on businesses.‖ (Gov. Code, § 11346.2,\nsubd. (b)(6)(A).) In addition, Government Code section 11346.5 subdivision\n(a)(8) provides: ―If a state agency, in adopting, amending, or repealing any\nadministrative regulation, makes an initial determination that the action will not\nhave a significant, statewide adverse economic impact directly affecting business,\nincluding the ability of California businesses to compete with businesses in other\nstates, it shall make a declaration to that effect in the notice of proposed action. In\nmaking this declaration, the agency shall provide in the record facts, evidence,\ndocuments, testimony, or other evidence upon which the agency relies to support\nits initial determination.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Maxwell-Jolly) extensively discussed\nthe economic impact assessment required by the APA. There, the court rejected\nthe state agency‘s argument that in its initial determination of economic impact, it\nis obliged only to ―consider‖ the proposal‘s impact and may rely solely on its\n―beliefs.‖ (Id. at p. 305.) ―[M]ere speculative belief is not sufficient to support an\nagency declaration of its initial determination about economic impact . . . .‖ (Id. at\npp. 305–306.) Rather, ―the agency must provide in the record any ‗ ―facts,\nevidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence‖ ‘ upon which it relies for its\ninitial determination. (Gov. Code, §§ 11346.5, subd. (a)(8), 11347.3, subd.\n(b)(4).) . . . . An agency specifically must ‗assess‘ the potential adverse economic\nimpact on California business and individuals of a proposed regulation (Gov.\nCode, § 11346.3) and declare in the notice of proposed action any ‗initial\ndetermination that the action will not have a significant statewide adverse\neconomic impact directly affecting business.‘ (Gov. Code, § 11346.5, subd.\n(a)(8).) These provisions plainly call for an evaluation based on facts.‖ (Maxwell-\nJolly, at p. 306.)\n       At the same time, Maxwell-Jolly emphasized that ―a regulation is not\nnecessarily invalid, even if it has a significant adverse economic impact on\nbusiness. Government Code section 11346.3 only requires that ‗agencies . . .\nassess the potential for adverse economic impact on California business\nenterprises and individuals, avoiding the imposition of unnecessary or\nunreasonable regulations or reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance\nrequirements.‘ (Gov. Code, § 11346.3, subd. (a), italics added.) Thus, regulations\n\n                                           30\n\fmay have negative economic impacts if necessary or reasonable under the\ncircumstances.‖ (Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 306.)\n       Maxwell-Jolly further explained that ―the reference to a ‗determination‘ in\nGovernment Code section 11346.5, subdivision (a)(8) states merely that if an\nagency makes an ‗initial determination that the action will not have a significant,\nstatewide adverse economic impact directly affecting business . . . it shall make a\ndeclaration to that effect in the notice of proposed action.‘ (Gov. Code,\n§ 11346.5, subd. (a)(8), italics added.) The qualifying adjective ‗initial‘ indicates\nthe agency‘s determination need not be conclusive, and the qualifying adjective\n‗significant‘ indicates that the agency need not assess or declare all adverse\neconomic impact anticipated.‖ (Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 307.)\n       ―Given these factors,‖ the Maxwell-Jolly court said, ―we conclude the\nDepartment‘s obligation in its initial determination was to make an initial showing\nthat there was some factual basis for the Department‘s decision. We review the\nDepartment‘s initial determination to determine that the Department has\nsubstantially complied with its obligations, and whether it is supported by some\nsubstantial evidence.‖ (Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 307.)\n       We agree with the Maxwell-Jolly court‘s understanding of what the\nrequirement of an initial economic impact assessment entails. The requirement is\nintended to ensure that such information is provided early in the rulemaking\nprocess and then refined based on public comment and further consideration in the\nlater stages. Specifically, an economic impact assessment of a proposed\nregulation has three phases. First, the agency makes an initial, provisional\ndetermination of whether the proposed rule will have a significant adverse\neconomic impact on businesses. Second, during the public comment period,\naffected parties may comment on the agency‘s initial determination and supply\nadditional information relevant to the issue. Third, when the agency issues its\n\n                                          31\n\ffinal decision and statement of reasons, it must respond to the public comments\nand either change its proposal in response to the comments or explain why it has\nnot.\n       We also agree with Maxwell-Jolly and with the Board that an agency‘s\ninitial determination of economic impact need not exhaustively examine the\nsubject or involve extensive data collection. The agency is required only to ―make\nan initial showing that there was some factual basis for [its] determination.‖\n(Maxwell-Jolly, supra, 199 Cal.4th at p. 307.) Moreover, inferences and\nprojections that are ― ‗the product of logic and reason‘ ‖ may provide a valid basis\nfor an initial determination of economic impact. (Id. at p. 308.) And a regulation\nwill not be invalidated simply because of disagreement over the strict accuracy of\ncost estimates on which the agency relied to support its initial determination. (See\nGov. Code, § 11346.5, subd. (c) [regulation may not be invalidated ―if there has\nbeen substantial compliance with [initial notice] requirements‖].)\n       Even under this deferential standard, however, we agree with WSPA and\nthe courts below that the Board‘s initial determination that Rule 474 would not\nhave a significant adverse impact on businesses did not substantially comply with\nthe APA. The Board relied on a 2006 document titled ―Revenue Estimate‖\nconcerning proposed Rule 474. According to the document, which was prepared\nby Board staff, WSPA reported that there are 20 major refineries located in\nCalifornia, with five in Los Angeles County and four in Contra Costa County.\n(Bd. of Equalization, Revenue Estimates, Issue No. 6-001 (June 7, 2006) p. 2.)\nCounty data indicated that the total assessment in these two counties was over $14\nbillion, with about 80 percent of that value enrolled as fixtures. Projecting figures\nstatewide, the Board staff estimated that there was $32 billion of refinery property,\nof which $25 billion consisted of fixtures and $7 billion in land and non-fixture\nimprovements. To ―conservatively estimate[]‖ the incremental amount of taxable\n\n                                         32\n\fassessed value resulting from the proposed rule, the Board staff multiplied the $7\nbillion in land value by a 2 percent appreciation factor to conclude that Rule 474\nwould yield ―at least $140 million‖ in additional assessed value. (Id. at p. 3.) The\nBoard staff then multiplied $140 million by the 1 percent tax on real property\npermitted under article XIII A to arrive at $1.4 million as the annual estimated\nrevenue effect of Rule 474, while acknowledging that ―[t]he actual revenue effect\ncould be considerably higher or lower depending on the number of properties\n[affected] and the actual amount of offsetting values.‖ (Ibid.) Based on these\ncalculations, the Board concluded that Rule 474 ―will not have a significant\nadverse economic impact on businesses.‖\n       The trial court observed that even after extended oral argument, it was\n―utterly unable to understand why this calculation is correct as a measure of\nincreased taxes from treating refineries as a single assessment unit for decline in\nvalue purposes. Even as a theoretical matter, surely there should be some\nquantification of the effect of depreciation of fixtures on assessed value.‖ The\nCourt of Appeal similarly stated that the Board‘s analysis failed to provide ―an\neconomic impact based on data concerning fixture depreciation on assessed\nvalues‖ and thus ―leaves a reader without an understanding of what the taxes on a\nrepresentative refinery would have been under the formerly applicable Rule\n461(e), and what the taxes would be under the new rule Rule 474(d)(2).‖\n       We agree. Even assuming the Board could reasonably project $32 billion\nas the total value of 20 refineries statewide based on data showing $14 billion as\nthe total value of nine refineries in two counties, the Board‘s analysis offers no\nexplanation why multiplying $7 billion in land value by a 2 percent appreciation\nfactor is, empirically or conceptually, a valid or reasonable way to estimate the\namount of fixture depreciation that would be offset by appraising land and fixtures\nas a single unit. We cannot discern any theory or facts that would tend to justify\n\n                                         33\n\fthis method of estimation, and even the Board‘s post hoc efforts to explain the\nestimate in its briefing and at oral argument offer none. Further, as WSPA points\nout, even if the Board‘s prediction of future land appreciation were correct, the\nBoard‘s calculation failed to consider prior land appreciation and the full tax\nimpact that would occur if land were valued at actual market value rather than\nadjusted base year value.\n       It is true, as the Board points out, that WSPA did not offer its own\nindependent economic assessment during the comment period. The record shows\nthat WSPA expressed its view that the cost impact of Rule 474 was ―greatly\nunderstated‖ and that the cost would be between $5 million and $10 million per\nyear — to which the Board responded that WSPA ―has not provided data or\nmethodology from which its cost impact estimates can be independently derived.‖\nThe Board contends that because its initial economic impact assessment is not ―in\nconflict with substantial evidence in the record‖ (Gov. Code, § 11350,\nsubd. (b)(2)), there is no basis for invalidating the regulation.\n       But WSPA‘s inactivity does not excuse the Board‘s failure to make a\nreasoned effort to initially assess the economic impact of Rule 474. Even if the\nBoard‘s initial determination is not ―in conflict with substantial evidence in the\nrecord‖ (Gov. Code, § 11350, subd. (b)(2)), the Board was independently\nobligated — regardless of what WSPA submitted during the comment period — to\n―provide in the record facts, evidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence\nupon which the agency relies to support its initial determination.‖ (Gov. Code,\n§ 11346.5, subd. (a)(8); see id., § 11346.2, subd. (b)(6)(A).) Although we do not\nunderstand this requirement to impose a heavy burden on the agency, we cannot\ndeem it satisfied by an opaque calculation unsupported by any facts or other\nevidence explaining its validity as a reasonable estimate. Were we to hold that an\nagency‘s initial determination of economic impact, though unintelligible, may be\n\n                                          34\n\fupheld so long as it does not ―conflict with substantial evidence in the record,‖ we\nwould effectively authorize agencies to merely assert the absence of significant\nadverse economic impact on businesses, without supporting evidence, unless an\naffected party provided evidence countering the agency‘s assertion. Although\naffected parties often may be well-positioned to elucidate the economic impact of\na proposed regulation, the APA does not shift the analytical task entirely onto\naffected parties. Instead, the statutes require the agency to meet an initial,\nnonconclusive, nonexhaustive evidentiary burden. (Id., §§ 11346.2,\nsubd. (b)(6)(A); 11346.5, subd. (a)(8).) Because we cannot read out of the APA\nthis modest requirement of rationality and transparency, we conclude that the\nBoard did not substantially comply with the APA in its initial determination that\nRule 474 would not have a significant adverse economic impact on businesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f                                   CONCLUSION\n       For the reasons above, we hold that Rule 474 is consistent with Proposition\n13, Proposition 8, and Revenue and Taxation Code section 51. At the same time,\nwe affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal invalidating Rule 474 because of\nthe Board‘s failure to make an adequate initial determination of the rule‘s\neconomic impact as required by the APA.\n                                                 LIU, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

In particular, I agree that\nalthough the rule at issue here (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, § 474; hereafter Rule 474),\nwhich was adopted by defendant Board of Equalization (Board), does not conflict\nwith any statute or with the state Constitution, it nevertheless is invalid because it\nwas not adopted in compliance with the California Administrative Procedure Act\n(Gov. Code, § 11340 et seq.; hereafter California APA). But if the Board\ncomplies with the California APA and concludes, after compliance, that the rule is\nwarranted, the Board may reissue the same rule.\n       In deciding that Rule 474 does not conflict with any statute or with the state\nConstitution, the majority characterizes the rule as a quasi-legislative regulation,\nsubject to the great judicial deference applicable to such regulations. (Maj. opn.,\nante, pp. 11-12.) I disagree. I would hold that the rule simply represents the\nBoard‘s interpretation of the Legislature‘s definition of ―real property‖ in Revenue\nand Taxation Code section 51, subdivision (d) (section 51(d)), and therefore the\nrule is an interpretive regulation subject to less judicial deference. Nevertheless,\nbecause Rule 474 correctly interprets the statute, I agree with the majority that it is\nsubstantively valid.\n                                           I\n       Plaintiff Western States Petroleum Association sued the Board, arguing, as\nrelevant here, that Rule 474 — which relates to the taxation of petroleum refinery\n\n\n                                           1\n\fproperties — conflicts with Revenue and Taxation Code section 51. That statute\ndescribes the method for calculating ―the taxable value of real property.‖ (Rev. &\nTax. Code, § 51, subd. (a).) ―[R]eal property‖ is ―that appraisal unit that persons\nin the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally valued\nseparately.‖ (§ 51(d).) Through Rule 474, the Board applies the statutory\ndefinition of ―real property‖ to petroleum refinery property, which is involved\nhere.\n        The Board issued Rule 474 under its express rulemaking authority over the\nassessment of property for purposes of taxation. (See Gov. Code, § 15606.) The\nrule reflects the Board‘s understanding of how section 51(d) should be applied, as\nwell as the Board‘s factual findings concerning the market for petroleum refinery\nproperty. Under that rule, the value of petroleum refineries, unlike most types of\nindustrial property, must generally be assessed as a single unit that includes both\nland and fixtures. Specifically, ―[t]he land, improvements, and fixtures and other\nmachinery and equipment classified as improvements for a petroleum refining\nproperty are rebuttably presumed to constitute a single appraisal unit . . . .‖ (Rule\n474.) The Board‘s rule is significant because of the limits the state Constitution\nplaces on the assessed value of land.\n        For tax purposes, the state Constitution values land at the ―base year value‖\n(generally, the market value when last sold), increased by an inflation factor that\nmay not exceed 2 percent per year. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 2.) Rule 474‘s\nbundling of land and fixtures affects property owners because land values tend to\nappreciate over time but fixture values tend to depreciate. For petroleum refinery\nproperty, fixtures represent a major portion of the property‘s overall value. If\nfixtures are taxed together with land as a single unit, then depreciation in the value\nof the fixtures is generally offset by appreciation in the value of the land, and thus\nfor tax purposes the overall value of the property remains unchanged. If, however,\n\n                                          2\n\ffixtures are taxed separately from land, then the owner will pay lower taxes on the\nfixtures as their values depreciate over time, and those lower fixture taxes will not\nbe offset by higher land taxes because of the just-described limits imposed by the\nstate Constitution.\n       Plaintiff challenges the Board‘s Rule 474 because assessment of a\npetroleum refinery‘s land and fixtures as a single unit increases the overall taxes\nfor the owners of such properties.\n       The majority concludes, as do I, that Rule 474 does not conflict with\nsection 51(d). But in reaching that conclusion, the majority states that Rule 474 is\na quasi-legislative regulation, and therefore entitled to great deference on judicial\nreview. (Maj. opn., ante, pp. 11-12.) By contrast, I construe the Board‘s rule as\nan interpretive regulation, subject to a lesser degree of judicial deference.\n                                           II\n       An administrative agency‘s regulations can be of two types: interpretive\nand quasi-legislative. As explained below, an interpretive regulation defines or\nclarifies an ambiguous term or phrase in a statute, whereas a quasi-legislative\nregulation is issued under a delegation of legislative power to fill a substantive gap\nleft open in a statute. The measure of whether a regulation is quasi-legislative is\nwhether it makes a new legal standard where none previously existed. The\nregulation is interpretive if applicable statutory law creates an enforceable\nstandard irrespective of the regulation.\n       The differences between the two types of regulations were described in\ndetail by this court 13 years ago: ―It is a ‗black letter‘ proposition that there are\ntwo categories of administrative rules and that the distinction between them\nderives from their different sources and ultimately from the constitutional doctrine\nof the separation of powers. One kind — quasi-legislative rules — represents an\nauthentic form of substantive lawmaking: Within its jurisdiction, the agency has\n\n                                           3\n\fbeen delegated the Legislature‘s lawmaking power. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . Unlike\nquasi-legislative rules, an agency‘s interpretation does not implicate the exercise\nof a delegated lawmaking power; instead, it represents the agency‘s view of the\nstatute‘s legal meaning and effect, questions lying within the constitutional\ndomain of the courts.‖ (Yamaha Corp. of America v.

[Citation.] Rules that interpret a\nstatute receive less judicial deference.‖ (Id. at p. 1012, first and third set of italics\nadded.)\n       In summary, an agency‘s quasi-legislative regulations involve the\ndiscretionary creation of new law under a delegation of legislative power; court\nreview is therefore limited to ensuring that the regulation is within the scope of the\ndelegated power and not arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in a rational basis.\n(Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 11.) By contrast, interpretive regulations explain\nwhat existing law means, which is ultimately a task for the courts to perform.\nAlthough courts give ―great weight‖ to the administrative agency‘s view of the\nmatter, they do not otherwise defer to the agency. (Id. at p. 12.)\n                                           III\n       As noted (see pp. 1-2, ante), section 51(d), the statute involved here,\ndefines ―real property‖ for purposes of taxation as ―that appraisal unit that persons\nin the marketplace commonly buy and sell as a unit, or that is normally valued\n\n                                            5\n\fseparately.‖ The Board‘s Rule 474, adopted after the statute‘s enactment, states\nthat the value of petroleum refinery property must generally be assessed as a\nsingle unit that includes both land and fixtures. The majority here asserts that\nRule 474 is quasi-legislative because ―[t]he precise content of [the] regulation[] is\nneither mandated nor prohibited‖ by section 51(d). (Maj. opn., ante, p. 11.) I\ndisagree. In my view, Rule 474 interprets section 51(d), by applying it to a\nspecific type of property.\n       Here, it is section 51(d), not Rule 474, that provides the governing\nsubstantive standard. With or without Board rules elucidating the application of\nsection 51(d) to specific types of property, section 51(d) adequately defines ―real\nproperty‖ and can be applied to various types of real property, including petroleum\nrefinery properties, on a case-by-case basis. In other words, even without a rule\non point, the Legislature‘s statutory definition of ―real property‖ is, by itself, a\nfully enforceable legal standard.\n       This case is not one in which a statute identifies a complex problem (such\nas air pollution), sets forth a general goal (such as meeting state and federal air\nquality standards), and then broadly empowers an agency to study the problem and\nto adopt appropriate guidelines for specific industries that will achieve the\nLegislature‘s general goal. (See, e.g., Health & Saf. Code, § 40001, subd. (a); see\nalso American Coatings Assn. v.

In such a case, the statutory requirement is not\nself-executing, and the agency‘s regulation is necessary to establish which specific\nactions are prohibited and which are permitted. Not of that type, however, is\nsection 51(d)‘s definition of ―real property‖ for purposes of taxation. Section\n51(d) has no language through which the Legislature empowered the Board to\nmake new law defining real property. Rather, section 51(d)‘s definition of real\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fproperty is fully self-executing and enforceable irrespective of the Board‘s rules\ninterpreting how it should be applied in specific situations.\n       The majority bases its conclusion that Rule 474 is quasi-legislative on the\nexpress grant of rulemaking authority set forth in Government Code section\n15606. (Maj. opn., ante, pp. 10-11.) When the Legislature uses open-ended\nstatutory language and expressly delegates to an administrative agency the power\nto interpret key words in the statute at issue, the agency‘s interpretation of those\nwords is both quasi-legislative and interpretive. (Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co.\n(1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133701\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133701/ramirez-v-yosemite-water-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (Ramirez); see also Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at\npp. 17-18 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) It is quasi-legislative because the agency acts\nunder an express delegation of lawmaking power; it is interpretive because the\nagency is giving meaning to an open-ended term in the statute. (Ramirez, at\np. 800.) This court has not resolved what standard of review applies to such\nhybrid cases.\n       But for a regulation to be both quasi-legislative and interpretive, there must\nbe some clear indication that the Legislature actually intended and authorized the\nagency to exercise legislative power in interpreting statutory terms. (See Ramirez,\nsupra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 799-800.) A mere generic grant of rulemaking authority,\nwhich can be found for nearly every California agency (see, e.g., Ed. Code,\n§ 33031 [State Bd. of Education]; Pub. Resources Code, § 5003 [Dept. of Parks\nand Recreation]; Veh. Code, § 1651 [Dept. of Motor Vehicles]), is not enough to\nestablish that the agency acts legislatively whenever it issues an interpretive\nregulation. Otherwise, virtually every interpretive regulation would be quasi-\nlegislative, and the category of interpretive regulations would cease to have any\npractical meaning. That would be at odds with what this court said in Yamaha,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at pages 10-11, and because of the deference owed to quasi-\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\flegislative regulations, it would undermine the constitutional role of the courts in\ninterpreting statutory law.\n       Hence, in those cases where this court has concluded that the regulation in\nquestion has both quasi-legislative and interpretive characteristics, a clear\nindication existed that the Legislature intended the agency to exercise legislative\npower when interpreting the statute that the agency is charged with enforcing.\n(See Ramirez, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 799-800; Moore v. California State Bd. of\nAccountancy (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399244\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399244/moore-v-california-state-bd-of-accountancy/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1013-1014.) That clear indication is lacking\nhere. In such a situation, courts give the agency‘s interpretation of statutory\nlanguage ―great weight‖ but do not otherwise defer. (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th\nat p. 12.) Of course, to the extent an administrative regulation embodies findings\nof fact, courts must give such findings appropriate deference. (Ibid.; see Carmona\nv. Division of Industrial Safety (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608971\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608971/carmona-v-division-of-industrial-safety/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (Carmona).)\n       This case is similar to Carmona, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608971\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608971/carmona-v-division-of-industrial-safety/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a decision of this\ncourt. Carmona involved a regulation issued by the California Division of\nIndustrial Welfare prohibiting the use of ―[u]nsafe hand tools.‖ (Id. at p. 307,\nitalics omitted.) A group of farmworkers asked the agency to issue what was in\neffect a supplemental rule declaring the ―short-handled hoe‖ to be an unsafe hand\ntool and banning its use throughout California. (Ibid.) Instead, the agency issued\na decision that the short-handled hoe was not an unsafe tool within the meaning of\nthe regulation at issue, reasoning that the short-handled hoe was not inherently\nunsafe. (Id. at p. 308.)\n       That Carmona involved the interpretation of a regulation, not a statute, is\nnot significant. ―The interpretation of a regulation, like the interpretation of a\nstatue, is, of course, a question of law [citations], and . . . the ultimate resolution of\nsuch legal questions rests with the courts.‖ (Carmona, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 310.)\nWhat is significant is that Carmona, like this case, involved the application of a\n\n                                            8\n\fbroad term (―unsafe hand tools‖) to a specific category (the ―short-handled hoe‖).\nCarmona concluded that the agency‘s decision (which permitted the statewide use\nof short-handled hoes and thus was, in effect, a regulation) was interpretive, not\nquasi-legislative. (Ibid.) As such, this court gave ―great weight‖ to the agency‘s\ninterpretation, but the court did not otherwise defer to the agency. (Ibid.) Instead,\nthe court concluded that the agency had misconstrued the unsafe-hand-tool\nregulation, and that the proper interpretation of that regulation should consider\nwhether a particular tool was unsafe as used, not merely whether it was inherently\nunsafe. (Id. at pp. 311-313.) Carmona remanded the matter to the agency for a\nnew factual determination based on a correct understanding of the law. (Id. at\np. 314.)\n       Like the Division of Industrial Welfare‘s application in Carmona of the\nunsafe-hand-tool regulation (Carmona, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 307) to a specific\ncategory of hand tool, the Board‘s application here of the statutory definition of\n―real property‖ (§ 51(d)) to a specific category of property is an interpretation of\nthe statute. As such, it is entitled to ―great weight,‖ but not to any greater judicial\ndeference. (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 12.)\n       The question remains whether the Board‘s construction of section 51(d) in\nRule 474 was correct. In my view it was. As noted, section 51(d) defines ―real\nproperty‖ as ―that appraisal unit that persons in the marketplace commonly buy\nand sell as a unit, or that is normally valued separately.‖ The Board took evidence\nand determined, as a factual matter, that the land and fixtures of petroleum\nrefinery property are virtually always bought and sold in California as a single\nunit. Giving ―great weight‖ (Yamaha, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 12) to the Board‘s\ninterpretation of section 51(d), I agree with the Board that the relevant\n―marketplace‖ for purposes of applying section 51(d) is the California\nmarketplace. In this context, the California marketplace makes the most sense, as\n\n                                           9\n\fsection 51(d) governs the taxation of California property. I also agree with the\nBoard that the word ―commonly‖ in section 51(d) does not require a high volume\nof sales, but rather an examination of which type of sale is most typical among the\nfew sales that occur.\n       From the Board‘s interpretations and factual findings, it follows that both\nthe land and fixtures of petroleum refinery property constitute ―real property‖\nunder section 51(d), and that is what the Board‘s Rule 474 says. The rule states\nthat ―[t]he land . . . and fixtures . . . for a petroleum refining property are\nrebuttably presumed to constitute a single appraisal unit‖ (and therefore ―real\nproperty‖ under section 51(d)). (Rule 474.) Because Rule 474 correctly interprets\nsection 51(d), it is substantively valid.\n       Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that because the Board did not\ncomply with the California APA in adopting Rule 474, the rule is procedurally\ninvalid, and therefore the Court of Appeal‘s judgment invalidating Rule 474 is\ncorrect.\n\n\n                                                    KENNARD, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion Western States Petroleum Association v.
